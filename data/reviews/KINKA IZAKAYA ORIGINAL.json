{"text":"I decided to take my brother here for his birthday dinner since I couldn't make it to our scheduled family dinner. Even though it was only the two of us, we had to wait half an hour to get seated - but they did text you 10mins before a table cleared for you so you don't have to wait outside the establishment in the cold.   It was worth the wait!   I had the blackfish cod (best fish I've ever eaten) and the tofu which was nice. My brother had the bbq pork and bibbimap (I spelt this wrong, didn't I?) Both of which tasted great! For dessert I had the lovely green tea creme brulee and to drink the bamboo cocktail (I loved how they garnished it)."}
{"text":"Have you ever walked into a restaurant and thought to yourself, \"Well, this is going to be different\"? It's an exciting feeling that doesn't happen all that often; but, walking into Guu Izakaya on Church St., I was definitely overcome by that thought.  Everyone who enters and exits gets a loud greeting and goodbye from the entire staff. A bit overwhelming, but it certainly sets the tone for your evening. The place is an absolute nuthouse in the best possible way.  That evening, my two companions and I were lucky enough to get seats within a few minutes upon arriving, a rare feat as I understand it. Guu features communal dining, with long tables that seat around 15 - 20 people, as well as seats at the bar where you can watch the chefs work. There is a two-hour time limit for diners and often a 1-2 hour wait for a seat. If you can, go early or prepare to cool your heels for a while. I promise you that it will be worth it.  My friends had been to Guu before so they did the bulk of the ordering. They chose the best dishes they'd had before and also took cues from our tablemates who'd ordered some fascinating fare. The menu is set up tapas-style, a fantastic way to sample all sorts of delicious creations. We ordered eight dishes for the three of us which was just about right and all were quite reasonably priced.  The first to arrive was the decidedly (and awesomely) decadent deep-fried brie served with a mango and blueberry sauce.  The four pyramid-shaped morsels were golden and crispy on the outside and gooey, rich deliciousness on the inside. Like, eyes-rolling-in-the-back-of-your-head-good. Next up: the salmon sashimi. Melt in your mouth greatness. It's one of those simple dishes that really sings based on the merits of great, high quality ingredients.  On to the bacon-wrapped scallops and enoki mushrooms. Holy. Smokes. Bacon-wrapped anything is a winner in my books but here the contrasting textures played against each other so beautifully. Paired with the salty pork, the sweet scallop and earthy mushrooms, this dish was so good that it was tempting to cancel the rest of our order and have nothing but this for the rest of the night.  The beef carpaccio was placed before our wide eyes next and it was a lovely, bright contrast to the richness of the dish before. Served with with ponzu, wasabi, mayo & garlic chips, this rare beef was light and, somehow, refreshing. It was nice to have a lighter bite after the richness of the scallops before.  It was at this point in our meal that I noticed a crowd of waiters pause from their constant, frenetic activity. Then I spotted a server with a slice of cake with a candle in it. Guu's birthday celebrations put Chuck E. Cheese to shame. Not only did the wait staff lead the entire restaurant in a rousing rendition of \"Happy Birthday\", encouraging everyone to clap and sing along, but even the insanely busy chefs joined in. At one point, they had the lights flickering on and off. Utter celebrational pandemonium and it was amazing.  Once the place had settled down a little (to be clear, Guu is the least settled place on the planet), the strangest creation of the evening appeared at our table. It was roughly the size of a softball, deep fried and had a wooden knife protruding from the centre. We wracked our brains trying to figure out if we had actually ordered it, decided we hadn't and dug in anyway. What it turned out to be was a Japanese scotch egg with a layer of pureed pumpkin surrounding a hard-boiled egg. While I was skeptical initially - I'm not a big pumpkin fan, much to the horror of many of my friends - the combination of the creamy pumpkin, rich egg, crispy exterior and tangy sauce was downright addictive. We just about scraped the plate without chopsticks long after other dishes had been cleared away.  When the spare ribs arrived, it was all I could do to refrain from gobbling them all up myself. The marinated beef was tender and salty, having surely been marinated for quite some time. If you're a fan of spare ribs, these are a can't-miss.  The final dishes of the night were the decadent, baked oysters and the light, miso-glazed black cod. We ordered the oysters because we saw them arrive for another group at our table and they looked so unique! Kind of a twist on oysters Rockefeller, they're served with spinach and mushrooms, smothered in a potent mayo-garlic sauce and topped with melted cheese...all in a giant shell. This was a thing of glorious, messy beauty. The mushrooms nestled in there made for an umami bomb of a bite. Definitely give this one a shot, my friends. It's weird and tasty and I've never seen it anywhere else.  Not only was this one of the best meals I've had all year, it was by far and away the most fun. Unquestionably, the company helped but the atmosphere at Guu is like none other. It's not the place to go for a quiet, intimate dinner; it's the place to go when you want to try innovative, playful and truly remarkable dishes."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and interesting food. The lineup in the cold can be too much, but the experience is worth it."}
{"text":"First off this is actually guu! I come here whenever I'm around the area and isn't craving like a huge meal but just good well made izakaya food. Their service is always great with their infamous loud greeting when you arrive..   I started off with warm sake which is super smooth and goes well with almost everything there.   Also had their 6 piece sashimi platter that was super fresh and amazingly good which had 2 pieces of fresh Uni. The platter was I think $30 though so pretty $$$$"}
{"text":"Food: we ordered Beef Sashimi, special Tuna sashimi, scallop sashimi, black cod, spare rib, bibimbap, i also got the original ramue drink. Total is about $65 including tax and tip.  we liked the tuna and cod the most, i personally liked all EXCEPT the scallop sashimi. it got a 'unfresh seafood' taste.... Black cod was amazing!! loved the miso flavour twist.   downside: we did see a hair in the tuna sashimi the 1st time and i asked the server to bring me another one...kinda gross :S but we were so hungry (after the 2 hours wait!!!!) so it didn't actually impact our appertize.  I'm only giving a 3 star is because: 1. wait time is radiculous. 2. server was too busy to pay us any attention. 3. portion is honestly a bit small compare to the price...  taste of food deserves a 4 though."}
{"text":"Undoubtably an all time favorite. Great drinks, food and good-looking energetic staff. Everyone is so nice and welcoming here, pretty much as long as you don't come when you are having a bad day or alone, the experience will be more than thrilling."}
{"text":"Fun place. We spent a few hours eating & drinking, talking and laughing. They have their fried foods down to a science. The fried cheese and fried chicken are a must. The sashimi dishes are equally good. The mega pints are a great value, however if you're feeling adventurous, Guu has an extensive selection of sake."}
{"text":"We're do  I begin?!? Guu is such an incredible place! With all the happy cheerful Japanese ppl and there cute little screams! The place was loud but it's a great place to go! I wouldn't recommend sitting there and eat while talking with friends though... Because it's loud and you can't hear anyone and there's a time limit... But everything I ate was pretty much awesome! Cheers"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. The flavours are fantastic. Have been here numerous times and it never disappoints. It does get a little loud. If you're not up for that, try lunch on weekends. You can still order off the dinner menu and it's quiet."}
{"text":"Amazing time at Guu. If they don't have tables available it's well worth the wait, just go have a pint at the bar nearby and they'll call you as soon as a table opens up. A really fun night out, a place that  has a unique dining experience. Very raucous atmosphere, everyone is having a good time. Great for a date or just a night out with friends. Every dish was incredibly good, can't even pick a favorite!!! Had the octopus appetizer, the sashimi salad, mushroom beef udon noodles, tuna tartare, baked oysters, seared salmon, shrimp sashimi, and black cod. All fantastic. We were 2 and had 8 dishes, we were very full after, so 7 would be fine. We had a hot bottle of sake on a freezing winter night, which went perfectly with the meal. And to top it off they bring you frozen grapes with your bill!! So much better than a mint!!!"}
{"text":"Great for a group of 2 to 4 people who don't mind sharing a few plates. Atmosphere is loud and fun. I love the takoyaki - I've been to Osaka where they're known for their takoyaki and it's just as good at Guu. Some of the things I order every time are the deep fried brie, baked oyster, the calamari... there are a lot of great items on the menu. This place gets very busy and you may have to wait in line, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"We didn't actually eat here, we were driven away by loud music played through bad stereo.   Note for those seeking japanese izakaya  experience: Japan's izakaya are generally loud because of people talking, not stereos."}
{"text":"Guu Izakaya is an awesome restaurant in Toronto. You can expect a long wait when you come as the place is super popular especially for larger groups. The ambiance is fun, inviting, relaxed and you are encouraged to share a table with other people. Some of my favorites include the bibimbap (we ended up ordering 2 of these o: ), and the takoyaki. We also ordered scallops which tasted good, however the fried chicken was just okay. It's definitely worth going back to."}
{"text":"Loudly energizing. The food was amazing, we kept ordering more. Service was impeccable and full of smiles. Fried dishes (ebimayo, brie) were perfectly golden and crispy. Salmon tataki was fresh and melts in the mouth. 10/10 would return to."}
{"text":"I love Guu, even with the long waits. Somehow, in the winter, when you'd think the 40 minute wait time outside would be draining, Guu has actually made it kind of fun by turning their patio on McGill into an enclosed, heated waiting room where you can order drinks and watch the action in the kitchen. Great food and service and super fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great Experience. Super Noisy.There is no way you stay there for long coz they have high energy staff that greet your entry and yell goodbyes.Different kinda vibe.  Great food quality though.\"takoyaki\" squid balls were bomb.Deep fried squid on their deep fried menu was \"the bomb\" Friendly helpful staff.Good food."}
{"text":"Fun Fun Fun!  Lively and unique.  I love the atmosphere.  Loud and boisterous.  However, this is not the greatest place to take a date.  Hard to have a private conversation and hard to hear.  It is great for groups...however there are no reservations...so you might have to wait a little while (outside).  The food is pretty adventurous, so not for the faint of heart.  I highly recommend the intestines.  Overall GREAT value for your money!  Go for the experience!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of the place, it's very joyous and loud. The waiters all greet you at the door. I have no problem with the customer service (though it did take a good 10 minutes to get my bill but I think it's because they were really busy). The problems I had were with the food. Some of the food I found was really good; the oyster with cheese, the sashimi salad, the fried shrimp, the seared tuna. But other things were a little too weird for me. I really disliked the salmon and 7 friends as well as the egg croquette (which was smothered in mayo!) and the ground beef bibimbap was just ok. I'm a huge fan of their deserts though. The corn cheesecake and banana tempura were absolutely amazing. So, with the hit-and-miss menu and the very long wait to get a table(they don't take reservations) I might be back but not for a very long time."}
{"text":"I love this place - it is SO much fun! Granted, since everyone is yelling all the time (part of the fun!), it does get very loud and is somewhat difficult to converse. I wouldn't go on a 1st date here, but great place for date night after 1st date or nights with friends.  Tons of variety on the menu, and everything is pretty reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Fuc*ING awesome joint! Great music and food was rad. Atmosphere is amazing.  Waiters are great beer was flowing. All I need now is a spliff!"}
{"text":"Was here a while back and was VERY impressed with the quality and flavour of the dishes! The oyster was AMAZING. This is a place that everyone has to try if they live in the city or are visiting! It is seriously fantastic."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious!! The atmosphere was fun and energetic.  It was a perfect night out.  Highlights:  black cod fish, pumpkin croquette, cheese bimbibap"}
{"text":"Overall, extremely unimpressed. In fact, disappointed. Overhyped would be the one word I would use.   Also this isn't Japanese food. Don't let the decor, servers, and menu fool you. This is fusion food.   The worst kind of food there is. Fusion dilutes a foods culture, heritage, and true flavours so that it's less unique, less tasty, and less bold. Lose lose lose.   Also they were VERY loud. I've been to japan. Noone at any restaurant yells that much, that loudly.   I was impressed going in. Everything felt authentic. And then the aburi salmon came and that was a delight. Lightly seared salmon with a nice springy texture. Altho, in retrospect, this is in my mind a very nicely done western dish, not a tasty Japanese dish. There's nothing Japanese about it. The salmon actually looked like ahi tuna. Still, it tasted very good and my hopes remained high  Then it all went downhill from there. The pumpkin egg thing was soggy and cheap tasting (Chinese restaurants serve the same sauce on pork chops). The other salmon thing at least tasted unique. With a very interesting mix of textures. You had crunchy, slimy, chewy, springy all at once. Too bad the taste wasn't great. The avocados had 3 tiny shrimp (they say prawn) and while the shrimp had flavor, the avocado was sooooo bland. The cod came last and was mushy. Not silky an flaky like fish should be. It was mushy. Altho the preparation most closely resemble something Japanese.   Aburi salmon - lightly seared Atlantic salmon sashimi with ponzu sauce and wasabi mayo 6/5 amazing. The texture and flavours are perfect Salmon natto yukke - chopped salmon sashimi with seven friends (natto, shibazuke, takuan, wonton chips, garlic chips, green onion and raw egg yolk) mix them up and wrap it in NORI seaweed. - interesting mix. 3/5 Kabocha korokke - deep fried kabocha pumpkin croquette with a boiled egg inside - nothing special. 2/5 Gindara - grilled black cod with saikyo miso and white wine sauce 3/5 Grilled avocado & prawn with mayo and Panko 3/5  Overall satisfaction - 1/5 Service - 4/5 Value - 0/5"}
{"text":"I came here with high expectations and was not disappointed. Yes it was a long lineup, approximately an hour but in the end, it was soooo worth it. I think they open at 5pm so I highly recommend going at that time if you want to get seating right away. If you arrive after that, you'll most likely have to wait.   But once you're seated you'll come to realize EVERTHING HERE IS GREAT! The servers and cooks make you feel welcomed the moment you step in by shouting welcomes and thank yous & goodbyes when you leave. The food is just as amazing (I don't think there's one single thing on the menu that tastes bad). They serve the dishes appetizer style where they give you in small/medium portions and you order a bunch of them and share among friends. RECCOM: Kakimayo, Ikapiri, Cheese Bibimbap and Green Tea Cheesecake! The atmosphere here is so happy with authentic Japanese servers jumping around and serving you with smiles on their faces all the time. It's a lively place to have drinks and food after a long day of work. I will be back, just as Arnold Schwarzenegger said so."}
{"text":"Its become the hype among our friends. Waiting and shouting, the only two things I recall from my several Guu experiences. The food itself is good but comes in a petit size, so not a dream place for real hungry people especially not for people who have been waited an hour for a table. The food is great but a bit overpriced. I love the plum wine ( I guess that is the reason I keep going back lol ), but for the last three times I visited, it was out of stock. What a shame."}
{"text":"Really fun and great place to eat. The whole thing is an experience, the staff yells a greeting to you as you enter the restaurant and they are very interactive and responsive. The food is amazing, it's like a Japanese style tapas bar where you order lots of small dishes and get to try different things. My favourite item on the menu is the Pork belly, definitely give it a try. It's not cheap and the dish prices do begin to add up as you are ordering, but beer and drinks are very reasonably priced. Definitely a lot of fun and would recommend it to anyone looking for a dinner out that is a little bit different then normal."}
{"text":"Coming from Vancouver, there are numerous Guu restaurants there, and I have to say that Guu Toronto has successfully brought the atmosphere, the passion and the vibe here to warm up the city.  Food items are small, but allow for the party to share the variety. The alcoholic beverages are on the expensive side, but are authentically served.  What I enjoyed the most is the atmosphere. On a cold winter night, coming to Guu can really warm you up when the passionate servers yell, sing, dance and clap around you. It is quite an experience.  If the lineups are shorter, or if they take reservations, that would definitely make the wait on a cold winter night much more feasible."}
{"text":"This place is all show.  As soon as I walked in I was welcomed loudly and enthusiastically by what appeared to be every person in the restaurant shouting in unison.   However the food was disappointing.  Not authentic Japanese by any stretch of the imagination.  Chicken karage was greasy, buta kimchi bibimbap rice was ok but nothing to write home about.  The takowasabi (marinated octopus with wasabi stem) was interesting and probably the best out of everything that I tried.  Perhaps I didn't order their best dishes.  As others have mentioned I also felt the food was over-priced."}
{"text":"Guu Izakaya constantly has a great atmosphere and tasty cuisine. A great go-to restaurant that always seems to deliver on flavour.  Good variety on the menu and often offer a couple specials.   Tons of delicious dishes, beef carpaccio, seared tuna/salmon, marinated octopus and wasabi stem, sashimi and many many more.  Only dish I haven't liked is the seared beef tongue, it was tough. Everything else I have tried has been great.  Would recommended this place (unless you are looking for a quiet evening) and look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Great food, really fun atmosphere, and a unique overall experience -- I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Toronto. Obviously, don't go here if you want a quiet dinner or can't afford to wait (we had to wait 30 minutes at 9PM on a Tuesday night). But otherwise, highly recommended.  Food highlights:  * Gyu Carpaccio -- amazing! The combination of citrus (ponzu), mayo, garlic and raw beef was fantastic. * Karaage (fried chicken) -- super good, really tender. * Gindara (black cod) -- crispy skin, beautiful texture, perfectly cooked, great sauce. * Buta Kimchi Bibimbap * Kakimayo (baked oyster with cheese) -- we wanted to get this but ordered the wrong thing instead :( Looks amazing, and I've heard from others that it is great.  Food I'd skip next time:  * \"Exotic pork\" special -- this was basically roasted pork with a mild mustard sauce. The pork was good and not at all dry, but this dish didn't have enough going on for me. * Kaki Furai (deep fried oysters) -- ordered instead of the Kakimayo by mistake. Not terrible, but not memorable.  Service was friendly and efficient (despite being really busy!).  We also drank a bunch of soju and sake -- their selection is great! This definitely got pretty pricey though."}
{"text":"I Loveeee this place!! Best Izakaya place I have been...in both the US & Canada haha :)  I'm so sad I live in San Francisco...but sorta happy too because if I lived in Toronto...I would be here all the time and my hips would not be thanking me!  Everything here is delicious, try dishes you normally wouldn't like and you will be surprised. Service is great and although there may be a line, the wait isn't too long.  Love the cocktails here :P Prices are reasonable and drinks always yummy.  Came here for a birthday dinner for my boyfriend and then we came back again that week because we just couldn't get enough of it!"}
{"text":"My mother and I loved our experience at this restaurant!! Food and service was impeccable I will return for sure! We had the seaweed salad with tofu, the fried chicken, beef noodles and tempura snow peas. For desert she had a creme caramel and I had sort of a tempura banana split! It was a party in my mouth and in the restaurant :)"}
{"text":"Lots of delicious items on the menu that will make everyone happy.  Great vibe and lots of fun."}
{"text":"FIrst time in Toronto and only had one 2 days one night. We went here for dinner. So fun! You walk in and it's like you've entered \"Cheers\" . They are waving and calling out from behind the bar area. They are loud and smiling and as I've seen others post, you have no idea what they are saying but you laugh and smile right back. We were a party of 2 and waited 20 minutes in a small waiting area that was heated. We sat at the bar and ate several small plates. The staff (many helped us- not just one waitress) were very helpful, quick and so darn happy. If I had only one night again back in Toronto I would go again to Guu!"}
{"text":"Very, very loud (but that is what an Izakaya experience is supposed to be) and poor vegetarian options. They have edamame and spinach in sesame sauce in their appetizers, and a tofu salad that it bothered my stomach.   It is a very popular spot though and many of my friends like it, but its not the place for someone who likes a more peaceful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good food, pricy outing and tasty asian fusion food. This restaurant is very loud and has a pretty young crowd full of 20 somethings. Mostly bench seating for large groups and some small tables around the perimeter of the restaurant.  The restaurant is famous for the entire staff welcoming their guests every time with a loud welcoming/shouting in an asian language that I don't recognize.  Portion sizes are pretty small for the price. You usually have to order several items to fill up.   The food can be very tasty!"}
{"text":"everything i ordered was so good what a great place i will be back for more fried cheese"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Everyone is super friendly. They yell (greet you) as each guest walks in or leaves. It's actually really fun. It is not overwhelming yet it adds to the ambience and you get swept up in the excitement. Staff are really friendly. Great place to go on a date or with a group as it can be loud, yet intimate in a way."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good food. The wait to get in can be long but you can always put your name down and ask them to phone you when your name is near. I wouldn't recommend bringing a big group of friends because of the table set up and traffic, but it's always a nice place to meet people!"}
{"text":"It's a lil bit hot in there but overall would recommend! Loved the vibe there and service. The servers were super friendly and attentive. Definitely would recommend large groups and birthday parties. It was someone's birthday on the night that I went, and all the servers were saying the birthday song loll.   Overall the food was really good, I would definitely come back with my fam soon!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. rarely I enjoy *litraly* every dish on the menu. Strongly recommended.  And a uniq social expiriance: just go a head an order the Saka-bomb ;-)"}
{"text":"Had my birthday there, very good service. Although some of the food wasn't as good as I think it should be. The fried chicken is too plain, not salty or anything. Salmon and beef are good, recommended.  Btw, it's very loud in there, and a lot of smoke. But maybe that's how a izakaya works?"}
{"text":"Food was awesome! We arrived without a reservation and had to wait about 15 minutes. The restaurant was pretty loud, but it was a fun atmosphere. We ordered many different plates, but by far the best was the fried brie.... absolutely order it if you are going there, you will love it. We almost ordered it a second time. The sushi was delicious and tasted very fresh. I tried the beef tongue and also the marinated jelly fish... both were quite good."}
{"text":"Guu originated from our friends on the West coast of Canada, in British Columbia. With their bountiful fresh fish and lively atmosphere, they were able to create an izakaya so popular, that there are now two locations in Toronto. The name of the restaurant is supposed to resemble the sounds of a rumbling stomach, which is definitely how I recommend you should feel going into Guu. I've actually been here a couple times now, but never actually got around to posting up a review. After multiple visits, I've come to gather lots of opinions, so hopefully you can bear through this long long post!   After probably a one our line-up (this place doesn't take reservations), you will enter the small, dimly lit Guu restaurant, and be greeted by the entire house of servers yelling at you. Really. It's not a shocking terrifying yell, but a rather warm friendly one. Presumably they are saying \"welcome\" in Japanese. Likewise, when you leave, or order a birthday dessert (which is actually what we did for our birthday boy), the entire wait-staff and kitchen crew will not hesitate to serenade you with their cheers and song. It gets pretty rowdy in this small restaurant, but it makes the meal so much more fun and enjoyable!  The Guu Carpaccio, Hotate Carpaccio and Salmon Tataki dishes are definite recommendations from me if you are a fan of eating raw sashimi. Each contains sahsimi served in thin and small slices, which helps take in more flavour from the garlic, wasabi and ponzu sauce. A really delicate and delicious dish!   \"Gindara\" ($9.80)-grilled black cod with saikyo miso & white wine sauce  The black cod here is nothing short of amazing. It is cooked very well, with the meat having the perfect balance of raw and cooked textures. Not over cooked so that its flakey, but not too raw that its slimey. On one rare occasion that I came, the meat was overcooked and not well thawed. But in general, really good.  \"Brie Cheese\" ($6.80)-deep fried brie cheese with mango & strawberry sauce I love brie cheese. So seeing this on the menu, I just had to order it. In concept, it seemed like something that should be served at the CNE along side deep fried butter, and deep fried Oreos. In reality, I find it is a much superior item. First off, it isn't too heavily battered like the CNE foods. Somehow Guu is able to use a light batter and fry it nice and crispy. Secondly, the cheese isn't completely melted inside. This gives you a nice combination of melty and solid cheese.   \"Unagi Doria\" ($9.30)-bbq water eel on mixed mushrooms, rice with cheese on top I've had eel rice on many occasions, but cheese on top? That changes everything. As yummy as this was, be forewarned: this is a really savory dish. The eel is heavily (but deliciously) marinated, and in conjunction to the melted cheese it was almost borderline to be \"too much\" for me.   \"Takoyaki\" ($5.00)-deep fried octopus balls with tonkatsu sauce & karashi mayo Takoyaki being a more prevalent Japanese snack in Toronto, I didn't find this dish too outstanding. For one, it didn't have the novelty factor to it. On top of that, I found it wasn't deep fried crispy enough. However, the octopus piece on the inside was a sizable portion, and I guess that makes up for something.   \"Takowasabi\" ($3.80)-marinated octopus w/ wasabi stem Don't be tricked by how small it looks when this dish arrives, because it literally comes in a portion smaller than two Oreo cookies. However, it in no way means its short on taste. The wasabi stem marinate is pretty intense, and will definitely get the nasal passages going. Along with the chewy octopus and crispy seaweed wrap, this is easily one of my favourites at Guu.   Shrimp Sashimi ($17) This item isn't actually on the regular menu, but instead another daily specials one. I've always loved eating shrimp sashimi, but at Guu it's unique in that the shrimp head is deep fried and served almost like another dish. Surprisingly the shrimp's head had a lot of flavour and was delicious with the dipping sauce. This dish is rather expensive, but I find its worth a try at least once if you're a fan of shrimp sashimi.  \"Karaage\" ($6.80)-deep fried soy sauce marinated chicken served with garlic mayo Usually fried chicken doesen't appeal to me that much, but this one was absolutely delicious! Probably some of the best fried chicken I've had. The meat inside is super juicy, and deep fried light and crispy.  \"Tempura Ice Cream\" ($4.80) No meal is complete without dessert, and tempura ice cream is the best way to do it. I really wonder how they deepfry the ice cream without it melting on the inside? We ordered this with green tea ice cream, but they also have it in sesame and coconut flavours.  If you're up for a long line up, You cannot go wrong with Guu. A fun environment and great food :)"}
{"text":"This is always a fun place to grab a bite and some drinks. The atmosphere is lively, and the prices are fair for downtown Toronto. It's fun to be surrounded by such energetic staff, and have such a great selection of saki!  My one criticism is that it would be nice if they had just a few more vegetarian options. While the omnis have the pick of a fantastic menu, there's only about one veg option in each category of food.  If you go - make sure to make a reservation, as it fills quickly!"}
{"text":"This is my second trip here now since this chain of izakayas from Vancouver opened their first outpost here.   Last time in a party of 4, we tried the shrimp sashimi, kurage, cheese bibimbap, takowasabi, takoyaki, eel pastry, tontoro, aburi salmon, oden bowl, tongue, and yakiudon.   This time around, I went with a party of 5 and got to try another portion of the menu (gomaae, maguro tataki, short ribs, ebimayo, fried chicken, pork belly, deep fried oysters, scallop sashimi, grilled squid,  a repeat taste of the shrimp sashimi, tongue, kurage, and cheese bibimbap, banana tempura and a piece of wasabi cheesecake)   Phew, that took a lot out of me just listing that. From those two trips, I found that the only things that really stood out to me were the fried chicken, tongue, shrimp sashimi, cheese bibimbap, and gomaae (I can honestly say I can eat tons of that gomaae). Their deep fried dishes aren't too notable (doesn't feel unique aside from the fried chicken plus they offer mayo with all of them) and some things just don't work in my opinion. I like how they have Sapporo on draft, a decent selection of sake, and that they currently have bottles of imported Asahi Black. Their daily cheesecake flavours can be interesting (wasabi!?).   Servers both times were attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is just great albeit loud (it is a nice touch how they have mouthwash in their washrooms).  I feel like even though the food can be flawed (none of it was ever bad though), the whole package of something that Toronto has never had before has given it a bit of a glamour that it shouldn't warrant. I'd still heartily recommend it to everyone (I want to do a third trip sometime to try all the things I didn't get to try in these first two visits).   For all you people hung up on lineups: They're planning on opening more locations in Toronto soon so...."}
{"text":"So tasty!!!!!!!! Great place to hangout with your gang!!! I really want to try all of the seasonal specials!!"}
{"text":"I tried to go to Guu a couple of weeks ago. My husband and I knew about the long waits and showed up prepared to wait. The noise level was deafening the moment we stepped inside.  We were pointed towards the waiting area, which was a tiny tent attached to the side of the building. I stepped inside to find people crammed in like sardines. Within seconds, I felt dizzy and nauseated. My husband and another friend who joined us for dinner also felt ill.    The tent was heated by a huge propane lamp. They are not meant to be used in enclosed spaces, and this tent was tiny. The carbon monoxide from the lamp and the low oxygen levels due to the volume of people in the tent were the likely cause of the dizziness that all three of us felt. We left and found dinner elsewhere. The second we left and got outside, we felt better. The kicker was that even though my husband asked the staff to take our name off the list, we got a text from Guu an hour and a half later saying that our table was ready.   I'm not a fan of the \"no reservations\" policy that seems to be on the rise, not just in TO, but other major cities as well. If you're going to insist on such a customer-unfriendly policy, at least have a bar where people can sit and have a drink. I've read rave reviews of the food at Guu, but I can't imagine any meal that is worth sitting for nearly two hours in a tiny, cramped room while we all slowly run of oxygen. I won't be making a second attempt to eat here."}
{"text":"Came here couple time, with friends and family. I usually come to this place around 5-6pm so i can avoid waiting! because it gets really busy at night. I think this place is over rated, food isn't THAT good, but their service are excellent, servers are very friendly and nice! Great atmosphere! But, the portion size is small,  most of the dishes here are appetizer size, but again, because this place is a Izakaya, so it make sense that most of their dishes are like a snack size. They also have udon and rice, but is limited. I usually order this ball size deep fried egg appetizer! that's the only dish i like from this restaurant. Don't expect to come here for a cheap dinner, because it isn't! Depending on what you order, the price range is usually around $20-30 per person."}
{"text":"I think the food is good, sure but the service is absolutely terrible. And no, I'm not Someone who doesn't know what a bar is. I know things take time, but when you're the only brown person whom the server is serving to, and all of his tables after mine have the same food I ordered, I can't help but think about some really shitty reason why my food is not on the table.  I am sure Other people have had a better experience than me. I am just saying be careful who is serving you."}
{"text":"I went to Guu a few weeks ago with my mom and we made sure to get there before 5:30pm or else you will be in a line up forever as I have witnessed after leaving the restaurant around 6:30pm. I have read a lot of reviews about this restaurant and almost all have suggested that they enjoyed their experience in which I have to also agree with.  After opening the side door (in which I did not realize that it was an entrance), a hostess shouted in my ear (very loud) and every other staff in the restaurant followed. Don't get me wrong, because the screaming is their way of welcoming you to the restaurant. The hostess and the other waiter helped us to put our coats on the hanger and sat us down at a really small table. There are not that many tables inside, so you could imagine why there is a long line up.  Meanwhile when we were looking over the menu, the shouting continued as every other customer came in. When there is too much screaming, it kind of bothers you (I know some people can handle it, but not me and my mom).  Moving onto the food, overall the portion sizes are rather small and it is a bit pricey. I ordered:  1. Hotate Butter: Pan fried scallop with soysauce and garlic butter - it was only average and nothing that special to me. There was only 3 scallops and some sauce that you could probably make yourself at home.   2. KARUBI: Salt & papper grilled beef short ribs with green onion sauce - I do not recommend people to order this dish because it is just normal grilled beef short ribs in 'extremely' thin slices (around 4 slices) with not much of a taste (even with the sauce).  3. KAKIMAYO: Grilled oysters with spinach, garlic mayo and cheese on the top - This dish is quite good because it's like Oyster Rockefeller and I love that. There are 2 decent sized oysters with a lot of cheese and spinach covered on top.  4. KINOKO CHEESE BIBIMBAP: Rice, garlic sauteed mushrooms and cheese with seaweed sauce - This is a 'MUST HAVE' dish because it is SUPERB and even the waitress said she loves it the most. The rice is cooked to the right springy/al dente texture (not too soft), mixed with the very flavorful mushrooms and cheese.   5. Tofu Cheesecake: The cheesecake was very delicious as it's not rich at all nor too sweet like any Western Cheesecake. You can definitely taste the tofu and because it is not rich at all, you can eat lots of them. My mom loved it so much that she went to buy ingredients the next day to try to make it herself (which she failed).   After dinner, me and my mom had a little stomach ache. We thought it was due to the number of buttery and cheesy dishes that we ordered (not because the food was dirty). Overall, the service was EXCELLENT and the staff was very enthusiastic, welcoming and friendly. The atmosphere was filled with energy because there was a lot of shouting. I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a unique experience and I believe it would be more suitable if you went with a group of friends than your boyfriend/girlfriend."}
{"text":"Amazing spot, and has the best atmosphere. Great place to bring a group especially if they want to do Sake bombs! The food is always delicious, they actually have a good variety for those annoying friends in the group who are pickier. oh and they have great drinks!"}
{"text":"Food is great here but the atmosphere is ridiculous. Loud, boisterous, cacophonous - do not go here if you're looking to talk to people in your party. The loud cheers on every group of patrons leaving and entering the building is deafening, as is the din of the entire establishment. The servers of course are high energy, very polite, and attentive. The food isn't quick to come out but it is worth the wait, certainly. The appeal of this place is its raucous vibe but you can forget about any conversation while here."}
{"text":"There isn't much I can say about Guu that everyone else hasn't, so I'll just agree with everyone else that the price is great, the atmosphere is incredible, and the food is amazing.  It deserves a 5 based on the experience alone.  That said, a few things - yeah, you gotta wait unless you show up fairly late at night.  It is open until midnight, after all, and the staff seems to keep up the energy until closing, so you may decide to come later.  If so, make sure you know where you're going, because after the line vanishes, Guu enters stealth mode.  Even once the line dissipates the wait staff may be a little inattentive so be sure you know who to shoot glances at when you need more food (and you will).    Also the place should come with a migraine warning because it is loud, bright, smoky and really fast-paced inside.  But in terms of energy it's a great atmosphere!    Things we had and can recommend:  the butakimchi bibimbap, spinach gomaae, and the grilled mackerel.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 5pm on sat evening but there was already an hour wait!  Despite the portion is slightly smaller but all the items were very good. Good place, but better get here early!"}
{"text":"I REALLY had a ton of fun here.  We showed up at around 6:30 on a Saturday night and we went in and the guy told us it would be an 1:45 which was fine with us, we had read reviews and knew we'd have to wait.  There is a starbucks around the corner and before we knew it, 45 minutes later, they texted us and we got seated pretty much right away.  The place is loud and so FUN! By the end of the night you will be screaming in what you think MIGHT be japanese along with all the servers.  The big mugs of Sapporo might have helped this craziness.  We had lots of food and all I can say is just order everything, you will love it. It's tapas style so four of us ordered maybe 10 plates of food and with the drinks it came up to 115$. Not bad at all.  I would TOTALLY go back and bring my friends. Go find out what its all about. Oh and if you cant find it, just stand on the street corner and listen for the yelling :P"}
{"text":"I love seafood and I love Spanish tapas, so when my friend told me that we were going to a Japanese tapas restaurant, I was beyond excited.  The hype was most definitely merited.  We had just come from eating poutine from two different places when we were notified our table was ready.  I was a little full, but I knew a few drinks would get me back in Food Marathon Mode.  Turns out the atmosphere and the savory smells alone were enough to get my taste buds jumpin'.  When we walked in, we were immediately greeted by shouts and cheers.  They do this  for everyone and how they maintain this energy throughout the night is beyond me -it sure was awesome.  We ordered drinks and mentioned it was our birthday.  They brought out the drinks to more shouts, cheers, and awesomeness.  We ordered a bunch of dishes including, but not limited to, spicy tako, salmon tataki, and for all you Atlantans, a miso cod that hasn't tasted so good since MF Sushi was still open.  Seriously, it just melted in your mouth.    The drink menu was really impressive too.  My girlfriend loved her sake mojito, we all got a kick out of sake being poured out of our bamboo carafe, and the fact that they served beers out of taps that had samurai sword handles was fan-freaking-tastic.    All the dishes were beautifully presented and the service was great.  I usually don't go for that kind of razzle dazzle, but it sure did add to to the whole experience.  Just make sure to place a reservation.  If I'm ever in Toronto again, I'm definitely coming back for a visit.  Good job, Canada."}
{"text":"I used to go to the Guu in Gastown in Vancouver when I lived round the corner from it......exactly the same kind of food with no wait times whatsoever !!  ( Reason being they have 3 restaurants in Vancouver)     Having tried to get in twice previously I arrived late one saturday night...got straight in. The food is very good and reasonably priced but you have to order the right dishes. The seared Tuna in Ponzu sauce is a must. You don't come here for a quiet night out as it is extremely loud with all the theatrical shouting from the wait staff ( worse than in Japan) but you knew that anyways right ?    So overall it's good stuff but quite frankly I wouldn't bother waiting longer than half an hour for this.....hopefully they'll open another one soon."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is probably the best part. The staff greets everyone that enters and is always boisterous. Anyone complaining about the noise or portions clearly doesn't know what an Izakaya is (or what it's supposed to be like). The food comes in \"snack sized\" portions and is superb. There are many interesting dishes that you will have lots of fun trying. My favourite is the fried brie cheese. However, keep in mind that atmosphere is cramped (but I can accept that as part of the experience of eating at an Izakaya) and not conducive to serious mealtime conversation."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner Thursday night at 5pm, party of 5. It's a great atmosphere, the waiters shout welcome whenever someone walks in the door, the service is impeccable and the menu is very unique. It's an excellent restaurant for groups because you are able to sample a larger number of dishes (the dishes are pretty small so you only get 1 or 2 pieces each, but if you order a lot of dishes, it provides a good variety). I recommend the baked brie and the octopus balls! The cocktails are also very good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Very authentic, even the waiters barely know English. Food is great, it's very loud though but that's expected from these establishments.   Also expect a line up, doesn't matter when you go.   Great izakaya place and serves many different types of sake."}
{"text":"Three Words: You Must Go! Located in the hipster Church Street, Guu Izakaya is an experience, a well memorable one. At entrance there were no windows and almost sound proof. You open the door it is a whole different world. All the staff greet you with enthusiasm midst of the service, which may put you under a forced spotlight out of your comfort-zone, but right away  you feel special. They have bar-stools and communal benches, so you might need to share your table with complete strangers, but with the loud ambiance it never felt awkward rather enjoyable.   Food portions are the size of tapas, so you are expected to order more than one dishes. For the beginners, they even have pre-fixed menu. Food is simply excellent. Make sure you order \"Gomaae\" the blanched spinach and \"Ikapiri\", the fired Calamari. I still have craving for these two dishes.   If you are person who loves extremely delicious food and loud environment, this is the place for you. And for those who likes quite peaceful dining experience, it is worth a try."}
{"text":"Great place for a fun night with great ambient and food. Friendly service. Birthdays were great! Waited 45 minutes but the wait was all forgotten in 5 minutes."}
{"text":"The food and service is beyond amazing! I recommend getting the fried stuff rather than the noodles, and grilled beef. It's a bit pricey for the amount of food you get but the service and dishes are beyond amazing!"}
{"text":"This is probably the most friendly Japanese restaurant I have ever been to. The atmosphere of the place made me feel like I was the queen of the house. Unlike any other pubs, izakaya and place where people drink, this authentic looking Japanese izakaya has people drinking and enjoying the moments. There weren't too many people drunk nor wasted. Also the music they were playing was uptempo music which made dining experience more enjoyable. The food that I ordered was spicy champon. The broth was so deep and rich. Even though it was spicy, it wasn't one of those scorching spiciness kicking me. I also ordered yukke (beef tartar). The beef was so tender and it was perfectly marinated. When you mix the raw beef with raw egg yolk, the rich creaminess added extra flavour to it.  If you have never tried Japanese food or experience true authentic Japanese experience, I highly recommend Kinka  irasshaimase !"}
{"text":"Excellent food and fun ambiance! Just be ready for all the shouting and singing from the staff..."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fun atmosphere and excellent service! You can enhance your dining experience by eating at bar. The chefs are phenomenal. Super friendly service."}
{"text":"It's loud so if you're not prepared to have fun or just looking to talk to people, don't come here cause people be ordering sake bombs all day just for the heck of it. It's family style so all of their food is for sharing for 2-3 persons. If you're looking to get full, don't come here. But if you're just wishing for drinks and some Japanese-styled tapas, then this is quite the nice location.  Occasionally you're here people celebrating their birthdays (or imposters supposing so) so that they're get an extra loud cheer for living another year; but it's all the vibe they put on. Gimmick it may be, but you'll enjoy the ambience they put out if you're not sick of people screaming like they do in the TTC..."}
{"text":"Yum, Yum, Yum! Great, creative menu and wonderful atmosphere! As long as you're okay with a bit of noise it's a great night out. It's a real japanese izakaya experience. The menu is really inventive and will leave you wanting to try everything."}
{"text":"Guu is a solid choice for tapa's. The restaurant has a bunch of long tables (communal) style and some small tables on the side.  For the food we had:  Salmon Natto Yukke -raw salmon, with scallions, garlic chips, cucumber raw egg and a few other things. It comes with roasted seaweed which you wrap the salmon in. This was pretty good and often a go to when i come here.  Karaage: deep fried chicken pieces served with a garlic mayo. I found this to be average, decent, but not memorable  Ebimyo-fried shirmp w/ spicy mayo. This is a super yummy choice.  Deep friend Brie Cheese -had berry and mango sauce. Tasty fried cheese that could pass for a dessert.   Kinoko Bibimbap: rice, cheese mushrooms, seaweed in a stone pot. I find when i come here order this is good \"filler\" and its tasty otherwise after dropping $85 for 2 people you still still be hungry.  Kakimayo: based oyster with mushroom, spinich, cheese. This comes with 2 giant oyster shells and it was my favourite dish of the night cheese goodness with oyster whats not to love?  Banana Tempura: deep fried banana w/ coconut ice cream with chocolate and mango sauce -perfect way to end the meal and the perfect size for 2."}
{"text":"The food is good with alcohol but don't expect to be full. I recommend eating a light dinner before eating there. It is also really, really loud and expensive there."}
{"text":"Prepare your stomach, ears, voicebox and eyes, because at Guu Izakaya, you'll be using all four.  Authentic dishes (e.g. karage), awesome selection of drinks, and a loud (but warm and friendly) atmosphere. Wait times can be a bit excessive at times.  They should rename their Giant Sapporo Beer item to Neanderthalian Sapporo Beer, because boy that thing is MASSIVE."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  wish it's a bit larger though.  The atmosphere is up beat, the food is fresh, and the flavor is just right!"}
{"text":"Food was good and well-priced. Come with lots of friends so you can try many different dishes without having to eat too much, and sit out on the patio so you can have a conversation (music inside is way too loud to converse comfortably, and you'll be frequently interrupted by the staff shouting their greetings to people entering/leaving the restaurant)."}
{"text":"Very unconventional place with loud servers, tiny furniture, interesting crowd and superb genuine Japanese food. Roasted duck is perfection, starters are unheard of and to die for and, last but not least, they serve Japanese Sapporo beer by the pitcher. Highly recommended for people eager to escape the asian food routine."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints.  Great atmosphere right from the start and the food is absolutely delicious.  We were there last nite just in time before the line-up started and was able to get a patio table.  Some dishes we had were:  Chicken karaage - large serving that is definitely good for 3 people; good flavour and very tender.  Takowasabi - great appetizer size; 4 nori sheets to wrap the salad with is awesome; mirin, sake and mild wasabi flavours are well blended.  Grilled short ribs - another favorite; lots of flavour and meat is tender; another one of those larger portion servings.  Beef sashimi - loved the garlic chips that were sprinkled on top definitely gives it a good depth of flavor.  Grilled beef tongue - liked that it wasn't doused with sauce; the flavouring was good and serving was larger.  Daily specials: sweet amaebi - served on ice and you can really taste the freshness of each shrimp.    I think the 2 of us would've tried everything on the menu if we didn't have plans afterwards.  This is definitely a favorite and a must visit in Toronto."}
{"text":"Juste délicieux! L'ambiance, la bouffe... C'est une note parfaite!  Les \"bibimbaps\" sont excellents! Pour se sortir de sa zone de confort, il faut tenter les \"nattos\". La texture est... disons spéciale, mais c'est un party de saveurs!"}
{"text":"I have a great time whenever I go to Guu. It combines some of my favorite things in the world - good drinks, good food, and yelling Japanese girls. Haha. The ambiance is the best part of this place, and you'll find yourself yelling along with the serving staff even if you don't know Japanese. I suggest yelling your favorite electronics brand \"sony nintendoooo\" etc.   Foodwise, I would recommend the salmon natto yukke, karaage, grilled saba, and kakuni braised pork. Drinks wise, you cannot go wrong with the big mugs."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!  We had to wait a bit to get in, but they took my number and we went to grab a pint around the corner while we waited, and called us about 30 minutes later. Definitely worth the wait! I was a bit shocked when the staff yelled when I was walking in, but it ended up being such a fun vibe in there. All the staff was super friendly and I definitely ended up yelling along with them. The food was reasonably priced and we didn't have to wait too long for our orders and they let us keep ordering throughout our stay, which was cool. Definitely going back for my birthday!!!"}
{"text":"Do not recommend. Feeling being rushed to finish my dish. Waitress kept forcing us to order from today's special drink menu even when my gf insists. We ended up spending 110 dollars for two. Not worthy. Won't go again. I would rather spend that money in some good resturant with nice service."}
{"text":"Fun staff. Good food. Nice location. I especially love how they greet and say bye to customers. Great experience. ...Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I friggin looovvvee this place!!!!!!!!!   Amazing service, awesome food and great energy. if you're feeling crappy go for drinks at Guu and i guarantee you'll leave feeling like a million (albeit drunken) bucks.   I can't complain about anything except for maybe the lines but other than that this place is a definate 10 out of 10.   Be warned for all you that complain about portions, this is an Izakaya,  a Japanese pub. Don't go to have dinner, go to have drinks and delicious snacks to pad your stomach. My fave is the Guu Carpaccio, beef sashimi in ponzu sauce with wasabi mayo and radish garnish. for the squeemish there's tons of awesome cooked items too- all calorie heavy and none to healthy for those of you watching your waistline.   If you haven't gone yet you must go! just be prepared for the crazy wait in line- its worth it."}
{"text":"I have been to Guu multiple times and it has never disappointed me. I have always enjoyed their atmosphere and staff is extremely friendly. Food is delicious and beer is good.   Overall, place is wonderful to go with your friends for drinking and snacking. However, it is recommend to make reservation otherwise you may have to wait to be seated and not a place if you don't enjoy loud noises and yelling."}
{"text":"This is the funnest restaurant in Toronto, although I usually head to sister restaurant Guu Saka Bar just because it's bigger and therefore easier to get in.  People who have not ruined their hearing with years of iPod use may find this place noisy.  That said, I have been to the Guu restaurants with people of all sorts of tastes, and everybody has had a good time and enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Like many Izakaya restaurants, there are lots of loud yelling of greetings and orders and celebrations and such from wait staff, Kinka is no different.  Generally this is loud enough but not too loud that you will get hearing loss.  I do find that it adds a sense of excitement to the diner's experience.  At Kinka, everywhere I turn was a server screaming in my face.  It was very nice been greeted the minute you enter their restaurant but we had one server rush towards use and screamed Japanese into our faces.  Since we had reservations, we where led to your assigned table very quickly.  As we where walking towards our table, the server turned around and again screamed Japanese into our faces.  I was impressed by these servers vocal abilities. It was like having a firecracker go off right in front of your face. After we ordered, they screamed out the order from our table to the kitchen.  This time the scream was louder, I suppose it had to be since it had to reach the kitchen.  Or, it could be the fact that she screamed right into my ears.  We ordered the 9 course tasting menu.  The salmon titakka (I think that is how you spell it) was exceptional.  The kimchi bibambup was very good also.  The battered fried shrimp and fried chicken were greasy.  Flavour is ok but it left a film of grease on your tongue. The salad, octopus pancake, and BBQ beef short ribs are ok.  I would definitely go back for the salmon titakka for sure (that is after I have my hearing test done first to make sure I have not acquire any hearing loss from the constant screaming of orders into my ears from servers screaming out other table's orders for the kitchen to hear)."}
{"text":"This is my FAVOURITE restaurant in Toronto!  I have literally tried everything on their regular menu and have also tried as much of the seasonal menu as i could and I have loved every dish! This is really rare for me as I have very high standards for what is considered \"GREAT\". This place offers GREAT food!   I also love the warm, friendly and fun atmosphere at this place which makes dining even more interesting!   The fact that this place is ran by group of young japanese also amazes me. We don't have that many japanese in tdot but i hope that we get more!"}
{"text":"When you join the party at Guu, you're family!  The whole restaurant welcomes you in loud, hilarious Japanese, and whether you sit at a table or up at the bar you'll have a great experience.  The food is dependable, the drinks are strong, and the service is quick.  Go Guu - you'll have a great time!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time for my own birthday party last week. I had heard rave reviews from people I knew who had gone before and I decided to check it out myself.  We went in a group of six, although some people arrived late and there was a 2 hour time limit that started as soon as we sat down. Even though we had arrived at 5:30, a line was beginning to start so we decided to grab a patio table and spend our precious first half hour waiting for others to arrive and start ordering instead of standing in line. In the end, we had just enough time (although no one ordered dessert).  The six of us shared 12 dishes and three of us ordered cocktails which came to about $150 with tax and tip at the end of the meal, which we thought was fair. Although the servings were tiny, they were flavourful and delicious. Some were harder to share as they came in servings of three or five but we were satisfied at the end of it. I would recommend the beef or scallop sashimi which were delectable.The spicy calamari and baked brie were a bit odd, as in they didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the standard Japanese fare in my opinion, but my friends seemed to really like them. The bamboo cocktail (which my friend had) was really good. I had the cherry blossom which was great but after the first few sips began to taste like medicine.  The host and wait staff were all very nice and careful to explain things. The whole restaurant shouted greetings when we walked in and out of the restaurant which is part of the Guu charm. The restaurant has a great atmosphere, a bit loud of course, but since we were sitting outside it was fine. Also, if you bring your receipt to the tent outside the entrance to Guu, you and the rest of the table can draw for small prizes which I thought was a fun touch. I don't know if they have that all year though. Everyone there was having fun. I would recommend this place to anyone and hope to go again soon!"}
{"text":"...waiting time has gone down (yeah), but the experience and food is still fantastic.  I hate to love this place."}
{"text":"I am Japanese.I don't understand why Canadian people likes Guu. Food is not good!!! Cooking is like a frozen food at all."}
{"text":"I had never tried izakaya, so this was a first.  We had some hot sake, and I ordered the takoyaki and kinoko bibimbap. Takoyaki was warm, soft, salty and sweet and very good. Bibimbap wasn't that great...i just tasted a lot of saltiness. However, salty is to be expected.   Only complaint; it's a little too loud, but hey, it's Guu's style.  I'm personally not a fan, but the food is quite good, and service is good. I liked it when they yelled welcoming words to me when I walked in, but when they kept doing it for other people (they're just being enthusiastic and welcoming, not their fault), I couldn't hear my friends talk and they had to repeat the same thing. If you are meeting up with old friends, this might not be the best, as you might want some place where you can hear each other well.   Overall, worth a visit to see if you love it or not. It's quite a unique experience."}
{"text":"I was here a few months ago.  Some of the items we ordered were actually quite delicious.   The majority of the space are long tables so there is a chance you might be bumping elbows with a stranger in another party.   Some of the items I found were covered in just too much sauce(s).  The menu has a variety of items so theres something for everyone.   This place is a novelty,  everyone should try it at least once just for the experience. All of the staff will yell and greet you when you enter and yell you a farewell as you go.  It is a very lively place and has a great energy in the atmosphere.  It can be a little pricey,  but like I said everybody should experience it once."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times, and I want to give 2 stars for dinner time. Lunch time gets 5 starts.  Lunch time, they have some very tasty lunch meals and you can also order some items individually. It is nice and quiet, staffs are nice, and the foods are better than dinner time. There is nothing to complain. I'd be happy to go back there everyday for lunch ;)  Dinner, on the other hand, it was noisy as he** and I was not even able to hear a word from my friends. My ears were in pain!!!!    I could only pick words by watching their mouths. We could not help but to eat without talking. And what's worse the food was not good either... there was even a fly in a dish. When we finally got outside, we were all exhausted and could not talk for while because we all lost hearing from the servers' voices. We laughed at our experience the next day at work. There was an older female staff among others who screamed the most to get the place even noisier. I felt her getting a bit annoyed (via her way of screaming) because she was screaming the most and others were not folowing her. But they were right. They can hurt their vocal cords... I cannot imagine going back there for dinner ever again...  Yeah, so go there for lunch. I think they can use more customers :)  Hope this helps."}
{"text":"As a fellow Japanese, I am not going to lie the food here is pretty good, and reminds me of my hometown.   The workers are usually very enthusiastic, but the background music maybe unnecessarily loud (almost like a club). If you are going there to get tipsy (as izakaya/??? literally means alcohol place) I think its perfect, but if you want to have a quiet and relaxing dinner/lunch I do not recommend this place.  I personally think they could increase the portion of the food as the price is rather demanding, especially if you take into account the alcohol price.  But overall, I like this place and would like to go there once in a while.  Thanks for reading and enjoy ! :)"}
{"text":"This place has to be one of the most interesting restaurants that I have ever been to! The service and food is extremely unusual, but I love it! (of course, this is coming from a white person, maybe it's not as unusual as I think!?).  Anyway, the menu is full of really random and interesting things to choose from. If you're in the mood for sushi, the selection is small and I'd recommend going somewhere else. As a vegetarian there were a few options to choose from (and I'm not complaining, I'm used to having a small selection), but all of these items were completely different and unusual. I ended up having the \"KINOKO CHEESE BIBIMBAP\" which was VERY tasty and did not disappoint! My only complaint is that the waiters did not tell me that the bowl they served it in was VERY hot (stupid me, I probably should have realized this) and I had to burn myself to find this out on my own.   EDIT: I just recieved a message that the cheese bibimbap is NOT in fact vegetarian in the way they prepare the mushrooms. Unfortunately I won't be eating this again, but I would still recommend to anyone who does eat meat =]  The atmosphere is VERY different from usual. When walking in we were greeted by the entire staff, and when walking out they all said goodbye! While I found this to be really cute and interesting, this can also get annoying when the whole staff is constantly yelling out greetings and food orders. My recommendation is not to come here if you have a headache!  Overall, I am definitely going to come here again to try the rest of the vegetarian dishes! The place was very busy, so try and book a reservation if you can! (We had to sit at the bar which was uncomfortable, but we agreed to it since we were in a hurry)."}
{"text":"The much anticipated of Guu Izakaya has finally arrived. We came here for lunch though, so its probably different vibe and food difference for dinner.  First thing I noticed is that this place has friendly servers who all greet in sync. They seem to enjoy their line of work. We ordered their two lunch bento. I got the sashimi platter and my gf got the chicken kaarage. Both comes with a side of rice, salad, lotus roots, miso soup and three pickled veggies.   The Kaarage is fine. Battered bigger chicken nugget size. Not the best, but good. My sashimi platter came with 3 pc sweet scallop, 3 pc salmon, 3pc tuna, 2 pc bigeye tuna. The sashimi was good, but I personally don't care about sashimi mixed with hot rice to eat, but its still fine. Not crazy filling but you'll be fine.  We also got two cold plates, one salmon and one tuna. Both lightly seared outside with some crispy onion and light soya sweet sauce and wasabi mayo and green onion.  P/S: If you pay by machine, they have this pre-installed percentage of tip starting from 15% and upwards, they do have 'others' listed, but I thought it was quite easy for them to get a standard tip rate for themselves.  Overall, lunch was fine. I'd probably come check out dinner once and try their dinner tapa style."}
{"text":"SOOO GOOD. this place is a must go, the atmosphere is honestly like no other place i've been, and the food is so good and fresh. I would recommend everything on the menu"}
{"text":"Long line up!! but very fun Japanese environment!! amazing food!! more of a drinking place & little snacks!! but the food is great!! loved it!!!!!!!!!!! Its a little loud cuz they shout in Japanese to welcome you & then thank you when you leave!!! very entertaining!!!!"}
{"text":"Just visited the restuarant yesterday to celebrate my dads birthday. Despite all the warnings about the ambiance, it still shocked me. I personally enjoyed the atmosphere and the lively energy but big  mistake in bringing me dad here. He absolutely hated the noise.   Now guu actually takes reservations now, and we came in on reservation. But even with a reservation, they seated us at the bar. I might have been okay with this If I was with a friend, but since I was with my family , it was disappointing that we couldn't face eachother and talk. We saw empty tables but the guy said they were \"reserved\" an for 6 people, however, when we saw people come, there were only groups of three, so....not very happy with the seating arrangement.  Now for the food. We ordered quite a lot, I actually planned to spend around 60 but with some add ons, it ended up over 100 for 3 people.  So for the food, we started off with takowasabi, it was super fresh and extremely strong wasabi. I liked it but only had one bite cause of the strong wasabi. Next came the tuna sashimi which was amazing. Other favourites include the ebishrimp, the ikapiri, the mushroom udon, and the kakimayo. The worst dish was the tontoro, which was overcooked and had to be spit out because it was so tough you couldnt swallow it.  Overall, I liked the experience and would return to try more of the menu!   Ps. They are extremely busy and not very organized. Our food came out fast then extremely slow. Also one of the waiters delivered the wrong bibimbap which he had also mixed up so it was too late. But the people were very happy and nice. I would consider going again only during down time or maybe on like a slower day"}
{"text":"Very friendly service and it feels quite like an authentic Izakaya. However, I'm not that impressed with the food my friends and I ordered. They came lukewarm and I felt like they were either loaded with salt or MSG. Perhaps it was bad luck? If I happen to be in the area again, I may give it another shot given that there are so many good reviews here on Yelp."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go with friends and family. Though there have been multiple Izakaya places popping up all across the gta this is still the best. The food is always really good quality and typically service is fast. Although the potions sizes are small because they are meant for sharing, they are well worth the price. Usually when my friends and I go, it will come to 40-50$ per person including tax and tip. That is all of us being fuller than we can bear with a generous amount of sake and beer as well.  Great place to come especially if you might want to avoid awkward silences with the people you are going with. Just beware church location is very very loud and will only allow you to hear the person next to you."}
{"text":"if you are looking for a relaxing authentic dinner, not the place. but if you want to experience excitement and tappas style japanese food, its your go to. different atmosphere, was a nice experience. been there once, experienced it, probably wont go again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, awesome staff and excellent food. There was a crowd celebrating made up of mostly Japanese people, and it was awesome, cause the staff would yell with them when they were celebrating. Very fun time. We completely dodged the line there, as we went on a Sunday night, but probably should get there early if you want to avoid the line.   My only complaint is that the portions on the plates are pretty small, so I would go there either after a meal to hang out or expect to spend a pretty good amount of money to get full."}
{"text":"Food tasted great, but portion sizes are very small. Dont expect to be full after 1 'entree'.    I went with my girlfriend yesterday and we ordered 3 dishes in total. My girlfriend ordered kimchi udon for herself, I ordered kinoko bibimbap for myself and we ordered the unagi don to split.    We expected to have all our food out at our table relatively around the same time (give or take 5 minutes or so) but that was not the case.   After we placed our order the unagi don came first. It was good, tasty, but relatively small portion. After finishing,we waited 10 minutes before my girlfriend got her kimchi udon. You would think they would bring out my meal at the same time... But nope. I sat there and watched my girlfriend eat her entree while I sat there with nothing. Of course my girlfriend offered some of her food , but I kindly rejected, saying how mine should be coming shortly. It wasn't until after 20 more minutes after til my meal came. By then we were both frustrated with the staff. During the time waiting several waiters refilled our cups with water and I asked them where my meal was, they always replied with, I'll check with the kitchen, and they never came back.   Overall this place was a bad experience. Good tasting food, but expensive for the portion sizes. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Food was terrific, very authentic, and very reasonable priced-- only place outside of Japan I've found a REAL grapefruit chu-hi (order it there if you've never had one!). However, service, while energetic and sweet, was very slow and absentee, and the noise level was deafening. The party I was with has all lived in Japan, and yelling various greetings, etc is customary-- but nowhere in any of our collective experiences did we encounter a noise level that made our ears ring and made it impossible to talk to each other. Next time, I would sit on the patio to avoid this problem. Have heard the one on Bloor is more 'authentic' in the noise-level department, ie bearable, though the food at this one is better. Wouldn't rush back because of the noise thing, but a quirky, mostly very authentic Japanese experience in Toronto."}
{"text":"We went here yesterday from Buffalo, NY. Their food is just as fabulous as its reputation.   Hokke (smeared mackerel) is stunning. The umami is masterly cooked and kept within the crispy skin. Their karaage (fried chicken) is juicy and elastic. One of the best I've tasted so far. The price is not high either. We had four people and each of us just had to pay $16 to have a luscious dinner.   The reason that I give them 4-star is because I don't like the noise, which is unnecessary in a restaurant. I've been to Japan several times, but never saw a noisy Japanese izakaya restaurant like this. Well, maybe it's because I've never been to the Guu in Japan. But the point is the loud noise is lousy when I had my food. In terms of food, it's absolutely 5-star, no doubt."}
{"text":"Ate a small meal here with 2 friends, and it we ended up with a few \"so-so\" dishes and some Saporro mixed drinks. To be honest, I probably would've given that meal a 3/5. Then I returned with a group of 8 and racked up a $375 bill, going all out for a Birthday. Going with the big group was an excellent choice (although it had to be at 5:00pm). I was with some out of towners who hadn't heard of the place, so the crazy atmosphere  collectively blew everyone's mind. We ordered 4 of the more expensive \"Party (B)\" meals, and topped it with 4 Udons, 2 Brie Cheeses, 2 Spicy Octopus, 2 Kabocha Korokke, and 2 Itame. We also got the Seven Samurai shots, which to be honest, were not the greatest (syrupy sweet). The Bamboo Sake was a cool gimmick and tasty too. It was more than enough food for all of us (in retrospect, we could've done without 2 Itame and 2 of the Udons).  Itame was my least favorite and Gindara was my favorite. The server recommended the black sesame ice cream but we liked the coconut best (green tea was not bad also). Again, not sure how the rest of the table felt, but everyone really enjoyed the meal. There's a reason Guu has hundreds of positive reviews!"}
{"text":"OK, I am not qualified to judge the authenticity of izakaya. All I can say is, the food is delicious and the dining experience fun. I've enjoyed everything I've ever eaten here, and given the small plate nature of the food, I tried a lot of different dishes. I would have deducted a star for the long waits for a seat, but they take reservations so those who don't want to wait can plan ahead to skip it."}
{"text":"Guu-ya!  Last night was my first (and definitely not last) trip to Guu. A group of us has been dying to get our butts over there and we finally made it happen. Luckily, we didn't deal with any wait times - got there for 5pm and only waited about 10 mins while they finished prepping. Even that was awesome. You could hear the energy bustling inside.   I've been told  by friends that this is as close to an authentic Izakaya as you can get and I love it. The litre-sized Sapporos are a bonus! The food is of great quality and presentation is great as well.  It was a group of four of us and we started off with Sashimi Salad, Takoyaki, and Kaki Furai. They were all yummy and set the expectations for the rest of the night. Next we ordered Gyu Carpaccio, Maguro Tataki, Gindara, Karubi, Ebimayo, Enoki Hotate Bacon, BBQ Pork, Osaka Fries, and a few other dishes that are on their new menu. ALL of it was delicious - some more than others, but all in all, incredible flavours.  From the warm, friendly and enthusiastic welcome, to the send-off, our experience was top-notch. Only downside to this place is that you can't make a night of being here. Two-hour seating time and you're out. And they'll ask you to leave (politely), but sternly. People are waiting. But, it definitely sets the tone for a fun evening...I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I heard Guu changed to Kinka so I had to try how good their food was. As we entered it felt like the same as Guu. A loud and welcoming staff. the service was really good. we got sat by the pass where the food was being made. The seating was quite tight but it was okay. Usually my favorite dish was the pork belly. The one at Guu was great! However, this one was really dry and was not what I anticipated. the other dishes such as the gyu carpaccio and tatakis where all nice as expected. It was a very busy night there and I enjoyed the cooks killing it in the kitchen.  Having worked in a kitchen before, it reminded me of when I was younger. as I was walking out I was able to peak out on their patio. Will come back for their patio!"}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype.  Upon entrance you're greeted by a loud shout of \"Welcome!\" in Japanese. The room was smaller than I expected, but combined with the patio it was a decent size which allowed for good amount of people to be seated.  Service was great - the server was extremely attentive and didn't hesitate to give his recommendations when asked or help us when we were confused.   Notable dishes: Gyu Carpaccio - great, a must-try. Sweetness and acidity of the ponzu really cuts through the beef. Karaage - Can't go wrong with fried chicken! Guu was no exception.  Deep Fried Brie - Also can't go wrong with deep fried cheese. Everyone loved these to death and we ordered another serving. Gindara - Their black cod was melt in your mouth; fantastic. Kakimayo - Can't go to Guu without ordering these babies! Fantastic, if you're going to Guu you must have these.  We also ordered the ebimayo, takowasabi, and pork bibimbap. Everything was great and I'm excited to go back to try the rest of their menu and some daily specials."}
{"text":"Won't be back here again, that's for sure. There were 8 of us and the waiter got our orders wrong. Half of us waited about 35 minutes more than the rest of us to get our food and it wasn't anything special. I knew it was going to be loud but I thought it was because of the music, not the staff constantly yelling and I think that's why the waiter got our orders wrong. We got a lame apology, telling us \"we can't do anything about it\"...thanks? On top of that, the waiter added their own tip into the bill without letting us know. If it wasn't for the crappy service, I might have given this place 3 stars. I'm sure there are great Japanese places out there with excellent food + service but this one ain't one of them!"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here often and we're always more than happy with the quality of the food and the ambiance.    Our favorite place to eat is at the bar and we share several dishes.   Our favorites include the tuna and salmon tataki, kimchi udon, salmon natto yukke and kinoko bibimbap.  All are complimented by a nice cold sapporo.   We can't wait for our next visit!"}
{"text":"yummy.  Loud.  Just like bars in Japan.!"}
{"text":"Used to be great. Used to be my favourite resto in Toronto. Has gone downhill. Not worth a visit anymore"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Guu ever since I tried it in Vancouver. As the first Izakaya restaurant in Toronto, I think it is by far still the best.   The food is definitely 5 star! I don't think I've ever not enjoyed any of the dishes I've had -- and I've easily tried more than half the menu.   My opinion, some japanese tapas, sapporo and sake, always the start of a great evening!"}
{"text":"Fun vibe, great food (for the most part) I don't remember everything I've had off the menu here, but for the most part it's good, and I would go again!"}
{"text":"N.B. This review is a bit delayed (I dined there a few months ago, but still...)  I'll admit, we were getting antsy when we had to wait on the (cold) patio for our table, and they told us we couldn't order food to eat out there. We drank plum wine and sake mojitos to warm us up, and ended up waiting 2 hours, as the japanese-fresh-off-the-boat-barely-speak-english-but-are-too-sweet-to-get-mad-at servers kept saying \"soon, soon, sorry for the wait\" and kept bowing at us. We waited it out, only b/c we were expecting a long wait, based on all the reviews. Apparently even on a monday night you wait to get a seat.    But boy were we not disappointed. When we finally got a seat, they squeezed us in at the bar, right in front of where the chefs were doing their thing. We got to see every dish they made, ask the chefs what they were, and order them too. We had octopus balls, spicy calamari, corn croquettes, salmon garlic sashimi, oysters with spinach, and tempura brie with mango blueberry sauce (hooray for japanese fusion - I mean, deep fried cheese?? YUM!). Dessert: tempura bananas with coconut ice cream. How in the world do Japanese people stay so fit? I'm sure they don't eat as much of the deep fried stuff as we did, filling up on miso soup and greens instead. But I just couldn't help it !   The greatest thing about the restaurant is how loud it is. When you walk in the door, ALL the staff yell welcome in Japanese. Even the people sitting in the restaurant join in (seriously, imagine us as we walked in, with everyone screaming and waving with a huge smile: \"irashaimase!\"). As we left, the lady held the door open, everyone smiled, waved and screamed: \"Arigato!!\". This kept happenning throughout the night, you couldn't help but join in. The decor is very Japanese traditional, then the music is cool house lounge music straight out of a beachside club. In the bathrooms, western saloon music. Seriously.   Best. Japanese. Place. Ever."}
{"text":"Everyone who works there are very friendly. They greet you with such an excitement whenever there is a new customer coming in. The ambiance is great; it's noisy, but okay if you are hanging out with your friends. The food is great! The seaweed-cheese bibimbab is really good. Deep fried brie is good. Mouth watering foods! Food is a bit pricey, since the portion is small, but i think it's worth the price. The cocktails are actually good too. I like everything about this place. Worth a try."}
{"text":"So good.  I don't think that's much of a secret, though, given the lineups (still!  How long ago did it open, like a year?)  The food is delicious, though I found the \"deep-fried\" section of the menu forgettable.  If I had my way, I'd order everything off of the grilled section, but hey, eating with other people means compromising and I wouldn't want to come here by myself anyway.  Though I probably could have; the seats at the bar don't fill up as quickly, and you can watch the chefs at work if you need the distraction.  All of which is just a long way to say this place is delicious and you should sit at the bar so there's space at a table for me."}
{"text":"This place is really fun!  From the moment you walk in, all the waiters and cooks greet you!  The music is loud, and the Japanese-North American fusion (stuff like cheesy Japanese rice) makes this place a hit! Very unique concept and delicious.  Love the friendliness of the staff!"}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere and my 67 year old mother loved it!  Thx Guu!"}
{"text":"Their saki selection is pretty great, especially for a restaurant that seems a little more high end. if you're downtown and in the area, I do recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is not the spot for a quiet and intimate date. From the time the door opens and you are welcomed in until you leave, it is a loud environment. That said, if you want a fun evening with truly fantastic food, solid service, wonderful sake and lively company, this place serves it all up. The salmon sashimi was fantastic and the beef udon noodle dish was absolutely amazing. We also had the fried Brie (good) and the blackened cod (great). The green tea cheesecake was a perfect finish to dinner.  Go!!"}
{"text":"??????????????? ?????????????????? ???????? ??????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????  ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????  ?????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????guu?????????????????? ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ?????????guu???????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Guu has really good food, amazing cocktails and nice staff. Try the sake in bamboo!"}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant night out in Toronto just a couple of weeks ago. Felt like we were back in the alleyways of Tokyo, trying out different izakaya bars. Octopus fritters, pitchers of Asahi, gomae, black sesame ice cream, screams of \"Irasshaimase!\", noisy, fun, seated beer garden-style.   Sad to be back in Phoenix, bereft of any Izakaya bars...sigh. We would probably be at Guu once a week if we had one here!"}
{"text":"I never been here for izakaya at dinner time, 'cause I can never get a seat.  For lunch though, I've been here multiple times, it's delicious. I had their ramen and hamburg. Their hamburg is more soupy than what I'm used to, but it's still good. Their ramen noodles are chewy, soup base is not too heavy.   Also had their dessert, green tea cake - that one, it's better at La Cafe Michi (but that's known for cakes)..."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for my birthday and the food was incredible! I would recommend going on a weekday because we waited almost over an hour for a table on a Saturday BUT it was worth the wait. I will be back again but only on a weekday."}
{"text":"Even with a number of Izakaya opening in Toronto, this one continues to be my favourite. It offers a number of tapas options, from seafood to meats to a number of veggie options. There's something for everyone. Things are decently priced, although I would not go with an empty stomach or else your bill would definitely add up. From beer lovers out there, I would also recommend trying their beer.  There are a couple of drawbacks. There is ALWAYS a long line up as soon as it opens. So it is pretty inevitable to have to stand in line and wait for seat outside. Another to be aware of is that because this is a traditional Izakaya, all servers and kitchen staff greet every customer walking in and out and it gets really loud in there. You might also have to share tables as half of the restaurant is filled with long tables and benches. If this type of atmosphere is not for you, I would not recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Guu facilitates smiles from the moment you enter the restaurant.  The service and atmosphere created makes you feel at home and the food is delicious.   Between 2 girls, we ordered 8 dishes in total which was more than suffice as we were extremely full. My favorite cold dish was the Aburi Salmon, the sauce was perfectly matched without masking the taste of the salmon.  My favorite hot dish was the Unagi Doria, the combination of cheese, eel and rice just melts in your melt.  Lastly, my favorite sweet dish was the almond tofu, the aroma and texture is AMAZING!!!  Of all the 8 dishes we tried, we were only ambivalent with the cheesecake which had cooked grains of rice in it....   We were situated by the bar which is deadly if you are easily amused by artsy, colorful mixed cocktails; as resisting to order all the bartender's creations can be  tough.  My favorite cocktail was the Cassis Oolong, I love tea with a bit of a kick. My only dislike with Guu is with their wait time policy, the hostess would not take down a phone number to call for a party of two but the luxury is available for larger parties.  The same wait time policy should be applicable to all party sizes.  Overall, ordering everything does add up making it a pricey meal but Guu is more than just a meal so the experience is well worth the money."}
{"text":"The food is just OK in my opinion. the beef tataki and spicy ketchup squid were the best things on the menu that we have tried but i've been there 3 times and each time the dishes were different in taste or quality. The first time I went the baked oysters were delicious and moist but he second time it was as if the oysters were baked for too long and everything just dried out."}
{"text":"Impromptu Yelp gatherings are great--except when they're at new hot-spots that have been getting far too much press and the entire GTA converges on them like paparazzi on fallen sports heros. The line-up for this place was insane on the random Tuesday night that I went with my fellow Yelpers. Worse, the place is small and sans proper waiting area so everyone was splayed along the walls, from the entrance all the way to the washroom--all the while being jostled by the servers and patrons en route to pee.    Worse than that, the wait was about two hours for our party of 5! Luckily, Mike S. saved the day by inviting us over for drinks at his über-cool bachelor pad nearby. We came back to Guu 90 minutes later as they were setting up our table and about to call our name off the waiting list.   The hostess told us we could have our seats at the communal table for two hours. Normally, that'd be enough time to finish but everything arrived at a glacial pace. And as with most izakaya food, the food on the plates is in dollhouse portions so it was hard to gauge when we'd had our fill.   FOOD (Arranged from best to worst) Best: Karaage ($5.80): soy sauce marinated fried chicken morsels. Tender and tasty, one of the best dishes that night.  Buta kimchi bibimbap ($8.50): Korean bibimbap in a hot stone pot with kimchi and ground pork. Another highlight that night.  Takowasabi ($3.50): a tiny dollop of octopus in a nostril-searing wasabi (real wasabi not that fake stuff out of a tube) dressing that you wrap in nori. It's refreshingly delicious and different but you really have to love wasabi to enjoy this.  Banana tempura: slices of banana fried in tempura batter, served hot with ice cream. I never order dessert at Japanese restaurants but I would definitely have this again. YUM!  3 kinds of shochu (a Japanese distilled drink similar to vodka; ranging from $5-6 for a single shot to $70-90 for the bottle): the Kurokame (sweet potato shochu) was fairly smooth and went well with the food.  A double pint of Sapporo on draft is only $9!  Meh: Hotate Butter: grilled scallops with butter, topped with various garnishes. I like the version at Ematei better which doesn't have fried garlic chips and scattered nonsense on top.  Aburi Salmon ($6.80): salmon sashimi seared on the edges with ponzu and wasabi mayo. Yawn.  Kakuni ($5.80): sweet miso-braised pork belly with boiled egg. I always love pork belly but I didn't love their overcooked rendition of it.  Yaki udon ($7.80): stir-fried udon with beef. Meh.  Worst: Gindara: miso black cod. Usually my favorite at izakaya but they ruined it :( The skin was flabby and the flesh did not melt in my mouth the way it usually does.  Ikapiri ($6.50): deep-fried calamari with spicy ketchup and wasabi mayo. The sauce on this was sickly sweet and the squid was kind of lost in it.  SERVICE Even though the service was well meaning, we had to wait crazy-long for everything, including the alcohol and water, but I will attribute that to opening-weeks incompetence. I like that this place is run by real Japanese people but our waitress' English was barely there. Luckily, I am fluent in F.O.B.   VIBE Raucous and fun. Think of it as a beer hall or tapas bar where the aim is to drink while picking away at small plates of food so you don't keel over too soon. Good for groups so you can try a bunch of dishes.  BOTTOM LINE I definitely see potential for this place to kick ass but the kitchen and front of house need to get their acts together. When I hear reports that they've improved, I'd definitely go back and look forward to adding two more stars in an update."}
{"text":"Was here a few months back, the menu is vast, and the food is darn good too.. Got a bit pricey because of all the components. but i would go back again for sure. Lovely enviornment"}
{"text":"For a person who had been living in Vancouver for the past 15 years, Guu is the place to visit in Vancouver. When I moved to Toronto a year and half ago, I was amazed that Guu has migrated to Toronto. Being that it is one of my favourite hang out place in Vancouver, it became a must for me to check out the establishment in a different city.  Short Version? Excellent food as alway. However, Noisy. Noisy and Noisy!   Unbridged Version:   My friend and I arrived at Guu around 6 pm on a Tuesday night. We didn't make a reservation as we assumed that it won't be busy at 6 pm. We were led to the table right beside the door (there were quite a few empty tables around: only one with *reservation* sign on top) - not a good start.   Second thing I noticed, long communal-tables (quite a few of them)... another thumb down. Is Toronto's real estate so expensive that restaurants cannot afford a more intimate dining experience? Or is this just how Japanese Tapas supposed to be like (this is certainly not the case in Vancouver).   Third, noise, oh the noise. They cannot stop screaming. From customers arriving to leaving the restaurant, everyone who worked there seemed to have unlimited energy in greeting every customer. It is SO LOUD that my friend and I had to communicate through text messages throughout most of the evening. I suppose I am being a snob when comparing this experience with the Guu in Vancouver, but boy was it loud.  Don't get me wrong, the food was great. From the black-cod to the tori-karaage, they were all prepared to perfection. The gigantic Sapporo mugs - Love it (had two of them)!  All in all, if what you are looking for is an amazing Japanese Tapas experience that emphasize on the food, you can do no wrong visiting Guu. However, if you want an experience where you also take ambience into consideration, this may not be the place for you - unless you are ready to shout to your dining partner all night long."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a beer and food with friends late night. Order the big sapporo, all the sashimi you can eat and the beef salad. You won't be disappointed, atmosphere is LOUD and fun."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun with high energy. Our date night in Toronto started off great, we didn't have to wait for a table, staffs are friendly and very pleasant . However, by 8pm most of the items on the special menu were almost gone. We ordered 5 small plates for the 2 of us, portions were great to share and so yummy. Sweet shrimps were really fresh and the black cod was amazing!! We will definitely visit Guu again for our next Toronto trip."}
{"text":"A place I would eat at for every meal if it was socially acceptable to do so. Priced so reasonably you think you are getting away with something, Natsu and the crew serve up truly delicious cuisine in the most fun restaurant environment you've ever visited. Sit at the bar by the line. Wave hello when you walk in. This is the most fun you will have all week."}
{"text":"Guu in Toronto!  Giving a few weeks for the hype to settle and for some of the kinks to be sorted it out, my girlfriends and I finally were able to check out Guu.  Knowing the frenzy and lineups, as well as the minus 20 windchill today....we arrived at 4:55pm, for the restaurant's 5pm opening.  There was already a line-up of 20 people in front of us.  They didn't open the doors until 5:15.  We were told that today would be 2 hour seatings, so if you weren't in the first seating, you were stuck standing in line for 2-2.5 hours.  Sad thing is that.....the line only go longer as the evening wore on.  So if you are willing to eat early, go to minimize standing in line. Lines are long in Vancouver as well, we waited an hour for our table....at least it's milder weather on the West Coast!  Once we were in...you have choices for tables, community tables and sitting at the bar.  If you want entertainment, sit at the bar - we were constantly watching all the dishes that were coming out (which added to our gluttony).  You get to see these hard working chefs, who in the midst of non-stop cooking, still find the time to yell cheerful greetings to guests.  Added bonus - you receive your food more quickly when at the bar, so the dishes are still quite hot and fresh.  Onto the food: 1) Sweet shrimp sashimi - one of my favourites from Vancouver; sweet and delicious! 2) Salmon Natto Yukke - chopped salmon sashimi mixed with egg, garlic chips and lots of other veggies and seasonings that you wrap in seaweed; a very unique dish. 3) Takoyaki - deep fried octopus. It's good, even though I don't like octopus.  Make sure you eat them while it's still hot.   4) Karaage - deep fried chicken, one of the best that I've had.  Light on batter, lots of meat.  Very juicy, not dry at all. 5) Ebimayo - huge pieces of shrimp, with mayo sauce. 6) Tontoro - pork cheek, lightly seasoned, very tasty. 7) Stewed Pork Belly - I looooove pork belly and this melts in your mouth.  Must try with the mustard sauce. 8) Beef Tendon (don't remember the name) - stewed, very flavourful with stewed radish and carrots 9) Yakiudon - stir fried udon.  Great for finishing off the night, warm and comforting.  I ordered a ramune (Japanese soft drink), which added just enough sweetness to my meal.  There were only a 1-2 choices of ramune cocktails.  Again, Vancouver has more choice here.  I am absolutely stuffed, as I complete this review.  I am pretty happy, but I know I can't regularly tolerate 5pm dinners.  The prices for Toronto are a bit higher.  It's not quite Vancouver's Guu, but it will do. It's still guu'd!"}
{"text":"Food was great and the atmosphere was entertaining, even though I couldnt understand a word of what the wait staff was yelling across the restaurant."}
{"text":"Having eaten at the Guu restaurants in Vancouver, I thought I would try the new Toronto restaurant on a recent visit. What a mistake. Over an hour's wait in a hot, dirty parking lot with nowhere to sit (no benches, chairs, etc), no ability to have a beer or anything to eat while waiting. After the long wait, I found the food to be average at best. Nothing was memorable, in fact some dishes were disappointing. Service was just ok. I emailed the restaurant afterwards to share some of my concerns, and they didn't even have the courtesy to respond - pure arrogance - they just don't care. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Don't waste your time or money. Toronto has far better Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"Came here a long time ago after exams with a couple of friends. We came at a random time before dinner and did not have to wait to be seated. I really like the atmosphere and it seems very authentic and a good experience. But as for the price of the food goes, I don't think it is really worth it. The food was good but nothing amazing. There are better Izakaya's out there."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. It's definitely not a place you want to go if you are expecting a quiet dinner. Great selections and prices, just not that much flavour on some of their dishes (I.e. Chicken) which is why I gave them a 4*."}
{"text":"The environment!!!! From the second you walk in they greet you with an amazing welcome! It's so loud! I took my boyfriend on a date, he was from out of town. He loved it! I have yet to hear the end of it.  I would recommend it for absolutely any one."}
{"text":"Loud and welcoming atmosphere definitely worths a visit if you have not been to a so-called Japanese izakaya. However, the food here is very basic and overpriced. Strict ID check for alcohol here too. U.S. driver license or Canada ID issued by provinces except for Ontario does not work here. Very frustrating experience. I don't think I will come back here again."}
{"text":"I tried most of the dishes, they are incredibly delicious !!! Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Am I going to say this is the best restaurant I've been to so far in Toronto? Yes. Yes, I am.  Atmosphere: My buddy and I came here after it being recommended by our friend. When we arrived, I was a little concerned by the amount of people in the patio and thought we'd be in queue for awhile. However, right when we opened the door and stepped in, we were greeted in the most rambunctious way possible. I read reviews before coming and I knew there was going to be 'shouting' but I thought people were just exaggerating but, wow; they really weren't. In less then a minute, the chefs and waitstaff were throwing words and cheering together left and right several times and let's just say if I knew Japanese, I'd join in as well. One of the funniest parts ever as Joyce P. mentioned was the birthday song! I was lucky enough to come when it was one of the customer's birthday and the chefs just immediately threw down whatever they were doing, put on silly glasses and sang the birthday song, throwing their hands in the air and dancing in circles. So, so cute!  Food: Our waiter convinced us to try ramune which we never tried before despite passing by it on several occasions. Good stuff. 'Better than coke', the waiter said. We ordered tebasaki (chicken wings) and takoyaki to start. The wings were definitely note-worthy and I've always been reluctant to eat takoyaki because of the strong smell but the takoyaki here was more subtle so after taking a small bite, I immediately just swallowed a whole takoyaki. Really good! My buddy said it was authentic to the core.  We then ordered gindara (grilled black cod) and oh my gosh, it was absolutely delicious! As a seafood fan, I thought it was superbly cooked and I loved the miso glaze. It was thin and juicy and I really regret having to share it with my friend (he liked it, whereas I LOVED it). Try it out fish fans; best thing ever. The only downside was that it was a small portion (think one and a half smartphone/iphone) for $9.50.  For dessert, we had banana tempura and green tea ice cream. Unfortunately, it was nothing special other than it being a good finale for our tummies.  Overall: What's making this a 4/5 instead of 5/5 was that our food didn't come for awhile and the fact that we were seated at the bar right NEXT to all the food was unbearable seeing how hungry we were. However, the quality of the food totally made up for it and I'm glad I came. I loved the attentive waitstaff, the energetic chefs and their shouting. I actually got a little angry at some people who walked in so serious and didn't even crack a smile. I will forever wonder at their ability.  Anyways, loved this place and will DEFINITELY bring more people here!"}
{"text":"I love their food, it's always very fresh and tasty. The service is good as well. The ambiance is lively and friendly. The only downside is the wait. There is usually at least 1 to 2 hours wait so it's a place I would go only for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I hate this place. I went twice, because I believe in second chances. I was disappointed both times. The second time I was also embarrassed because we brought a friend from out of town.  The food is not even authentic. It's great if you're 17 with a group of your girlfriends eating izakaya for the first time. So, it's not for me.  Also, the wait staff is amazingly rude. I couldn't believe the quality of the service we were getting. You also can't hear anything. I understand a loud resto but this was just unbearable.  This place is SO overblown it's made me lose a little faith in Yelp.  Anyway, if you want a fun night out with good food and some nice conversation, I have found that this is not the place. There are many other fantastic izakaya joints in Toronto that don't have an hour wait to be seated."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere (definitely on the noisy end), efficient staff, and decent food. A bit pricey though, considering the quality of food, but then again, you're paying for the experience."}
{"text":"Went for a casual dinner with my wife. Overall, we do not think that it's something that we look for. In general, it's geared towards a younger crowd and tried to emphasize on fusion food yet haven't quite get there yet.  We initially were amazed by their warm welcome, customer service is okay. It is a little tight to sit and most people must put their jackets to the clothes rack in the entrance which I feel a little uncomfortable about. We started off with a ginger sake and I found it refreshing and is a really new idea to distinguish itself from other Japanese restaurants. We order approx. 7 dishes, most of them are seafood related and was completely disappointed. If you pay attention close enough, you would notice all the sauces for the dishes are basically interchanging: wasabi, mayo, tonkatsu sauce. Our tongues feel kinda numb after 3 dishes since they all taste the same. While scrapping off the sauce and really getting into the taste of the actual seafood or sashimi themselves, there is little or no taste at all.  In terms of the environment, it is just way to loud to even chat with my wife.  Paid approx. $70-$80 for the two of us, and didn't quite fill our stomachs.  I would recommend it for people who likes Japanese beer or Sake and enjoy dinning in a party-like environment.  I would not recommend it for people looking for authentic Japanese food and feel full after a dinner."}
{"text":"I have been to the Vancouver restaurant and loved it, and have been looking to try Guu in Toronto since I arrived and it did not disappoint.  From the minute you walk in the door where you are greeted like a celebrity in true Izakaya style the service was fantastic and very attentive.  We ordered the Edamame, Spinach Salad with Black Sesame Sauce, Tempura Shrimp with Spicy Mayo, BBQ Pork, Seared Tuna Sashimi and an Okonomiyaki - all were fantastic, could not fault a dish and I would happily come back here to eat again.  Only reason I am not giving five is they do over do the whole yelling thing.  Greeting and saying goodbye is one thing but this place just doesnt stop, and when your sitting at the bar there is no way to have a conversation with your friends as its just too loud.  Toning it down a bit with create a much better ambiance still with the fun."}
{"text":"Guu is usually good although there are certain items that don't impress me while it is popular to many.  I love how they take reservations now unlike before where you had to wait for HOURS outside just to try this restaurant. The line-ups were crazy and people were willing to wait outside even in winter. This created hype , and I believe it made many people want to try Guu even  more to see what this hype is about.  I have to say, I understand what the hype is about when I first had it. This is a new restaurant offering Toronto good Japanese food."}
{"text":"a great place to chill out and drink cold/ ward Japanese Sake with friends. AWESOME food, service and environment.  I've been there several times, ordered different dishes and each one of them was so delicious and unusual.   I would definitely recommend it~!!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and great food!  Go for the brie cheese and oysters and you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I came during lunch. Two people mentioned how amazing the place was. And so, I was quite excited to taste these 'delicious' dishes. I tried four tapa dishes - not very impressed. They were all too heavy, which made it easy to get tired of eating the tiny pieces. Hopefully this place redeems itself during dinner."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food. This is the place if you want to try something new. My friends and I ordered horse on accident but we tried it anyways, it really wasn't that bad. The waiters a really nice and the place is loud but really energetic. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"4 out of 5! Great izakaya place. Fun atmosphere and worth the wait. Recommend the black cod & seared beef sashimi. Can't go wrong with most options! Order lots because portions are small. $$"}
{"text":"Always a good experience dining here. Great quality food and friendly staff. Can get very loud inside so don't come here looking for a quiet meal. Would recommend and better than North York location overall."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE STAFF  My experience at Guu on Church was HORRIBLE.  My guests and I have never received such bad service in our lives.  Myself and 3 guests arrived around 11:30 pm. we ordered 2 pitchers of beer and about 10 plates to share.  Our first impression was that the restaurant was exciting and the food was good.   However the evening took a turn for the worst. We had settled up the bill, gave a generous tip and each of us had about half a pint of beer left - the time was around midnight.  The staff was now eating at the bar and socializing.   I approached a waiter and asked that he not clear our beers as we wanted to step outside for 5 minutes to have a cigarette. To our surprise the man said no and that they were closing soon so we had to leave, his name was Kohei. I could not believe that a waiter was kicking out paying patrons.  I explained to him that that was very rude and that he should not speak to customers in that tone.  I sat back down disguisted by the attitude of this server and we continued to finish our beers.  Then another waiter came up to us and said that they close at 12:30 and that we had to leave.  I said that it was 12:20 and that it was very rude that he was kicking us out. He looked confused and his English was horrible.  He then walked away and said \"sorry sorry sorry\". Then another waiter sweeping the floors claiming to be the supervisor approached us very aggressively and told us to leave.  Puzzled, I said look around you - all the staff are eating and socializing and the place is not closed.  Give us the 5 minutes that it will take us to finish these beers and let us leave on our own accord - not with a negative twist on the evening. He then got angry and said this is \"bullshit\". Keep in mind, it was my 2 girlfriends and one of our male friends and we were polite the whole night and not rowdy or disrespectful.   The staff is now all looking at us making us feel uncomfortable and trying intimidate us. We were appalled and got up and left.  Outside there were two members of the staff - one claiming to be the floor manager - Yoshimasa Koga. We explained our experience and the man did not understand us at all however there was a gentleman that knew English and was apologizing for the bad experience. Yoshi then got on his knees and was bowing to us....very odd resolution.  He should have gotten his employees out that were treating us disrespectfully and made them apologize.   The type of service we received was disguisting.  I go out to eat 5 times a week and nowhere have I ever been told to leave a restaurant.  I wasted my money and my Friday evening and I am extremely upset about that.    You must address very evident management issues as well as train your employees to be courteous to paying patrons."}
{"text":"First Japanese restaurant since moving to Toronto - The food is delicious! Definitely try the oyster with cheese. The ramen is good and so is the sashimi. Only downside is serving size a bit small."}
{"text":"Guu can be a shock initially walking in with everyone basically yelling at you - but it's the BEST! I am a fan of really fun restaurants, so this is my pic for birthdays or when you want a bar but great food. There are definitely some misses, but I am not letting that affect my rating. LOVE the tataki, spinach, and deep fried shrimp. Definitely my favourite location, but sakabar is great too."}
{"text":"This place is more like a 3.5 stars.  The food is good, but I don't think it is worth a 1 hour wait (they don't take reservations).  The fun atmosphere kind of makes up for it, and the service was attentive (if you are eating on a budget, order the green tea, as you get unlimited refills).  We ordered the tuna sashimi, pumpkin croquettes with hard boiled egg inside, grilled mackerel, the seafood pancakes, and the yakiudon with beef.  It was all tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary.  We also ordered dessert -sweet corn cheese cake and an almond tofu -YUM!  The desserts were the best part of the menu!!  I would go again just to try some of the other menu items.  I wonder if the line is any shorter if you go earlier?"}
{"text":"Believe me when I tell you that I'm not a sushi or sashimi fan.  People will ask me to go for sushi and when I mutter that I'm not a sushi-fan, I get weird looks.  I normally try to avoid Japanese restaurants unless they can offer me something else.  This place did it!    Try to give yourself a lot of time when and if you go on a weekend.  The wait is ri-donk-u-lus!  But once you finally get seated, most likely with others at the long communal tables or at the bar, the food will come fairly fast.  Don't mind if people yell at you when you enter and when you leave -- it's some traditional Japanese greeting and farewell thing.    Okay, excuse my Japanese since I don't know the name of any of the dishes, but the yellow-tail something-or-other was yum; the seared scallops were to die for; the tuna in cucumber was so good; and the miso soup was made with red bean so the richness in colour and taste was amazing!  I also tried deep-fried chicken knee cartiledge; which may sound gross, but I'd take that over chicken wings any day!  Most dishes range from $5-$10 dollars.  For two people with about seven dishes and some saki, the bill came to $85 or so -- not including tip.  I'm a Guu fan!  Not a goo fan."}
{"text":"Very unique and fun place to eat. Prepare for a wait, but once you've been seated your night is all good.   The food is fantastic. Enjoying it with a tankard of Saporro, or some great sake' cocktails.    The ambiance is unforgettable. It's loud and energetic.  I've been twice and both times have been great!"}
{"text":"Ok...I must be getting old because as nice as it is to receive a boisterous salutation and welcome as you walk through the door, the novelty quickly wore off and began to feel more like their \"schitck\" and it soon became tiresome to hear such a ruckus every 3 mins.  However, I came for the food and surely it did not disappoint.  What did disappoint was that there is no value in the prices, you come here to pay to eat good food.  If you're ok with that, then be prepared to sit in a cramped space that's too loud for you to even bother carrying a conversation and just shut up and eat."}
{"text":"If you are visiting Toronto, are looking for a quick take-out dinner, and were attracted by the high Yelp rating of this place (like myself) - my advice is, go somewhere else.  I got a sashimi salad ($8.80) and a buta kimchi bibimbap ($9.30). The salad and the rice were decent but nothing special. It would be hard for me to evaluate the quality of the fish in the sashimi salad and the meat/kimchi in the bibimbap since their quantity was almost nonexistent. There was less than one standard piece of sashimi in the salad, and (by a rough estimate) about a dozen small grains of ground pork in the bibimbap. I estimate the total value of the two dishes at about $3.50.  To help visualize how little stuff there was - if I put the Yelp rating according to the quantity of the essentials on my salad and rice, I would have to put this place a 1/4 star out of 5.  Also, the constant purposeful shouting all around did not help, but I got used to it after some time."}
{"text":"Continually excellent in service and quality, this restaurant is fun and exotic. From the enthusiastic Japanese greeting to the savoury food, this place is a personal favourite. Great ramen and rice dishes, the restaurant also offers a wide range of Japanese sake and beers."}
{"text":"In the mood for something different from sushi and bento boxes and  you've never tried Japanese tapas?  Give Guu a try, you'll most likely be impressed with the number of unique Japanese dishes which go great with some good old Japanese beer.  Portion sizes are ideal for two so keep that in mind when ordering. No reservations, but if you don't like waiting just ask to sit at the bar especially if it's only a party of two, otherwise wait times can get lengthy."}
{"text":"Both the service and atmosphere was great. My sister and I got the marinated jellyfish, pork belly chashu, salmon carpaccio and the takoyaki. Everything was delicious! I loved the pork belly chashu so much, best I have tasted so far. The marinated jellyfish easy very tasty, it reminded me of the seasoning they use for the seaweed salad- I definitely tasted sesame oil. I liked the flavours if the takoyaki but within each ball had a small tiny piece of octopus and the rest was flour- I wish they used more octopus. The salmon carpaccio was thinly sliced salmon sashimi- it was yummy but over priced for the few slices of fish you got.   Overall, it's a great place to grab drinks and have a light dinner. The prices are a little on the expensive side for the amount of food you're getting but the quality is great!"}
{"text":"Last night I learned that there is more to Japanese food than teriyaki and sushi. Overview -  two-hour wait (they'll tell you an hour), boisterous dining room with communal tables, hipster staff communicating via call & response, cheap pitchers of Sapporo, and small plates of tasty delights - \"Japanese tapas.\"  Give yourself time to adjust to the scene and the style of the menu. It's a bit hard to take it all in until you realize it is broken down by cooking style in both Japanese and English. A few of the items are straightforward and approachable: maguro tataki (seared tuna), edamame, sashimi salad and bibimbap. But most are best for adventurous+ diners. Even a seasoned sushi lover like me felt squeamish at the idea of kurage  (marinated jellyfish) and the horumon (panfried pork intestine).   Nevertheless, the most finicky in our group tried and quasi-enjoyed takoyaki (Deep fried puffed octopus balls) and pan-fried pork cheek; this menu challenges to push your limits!  Four of us sampled nine dishes along with two pitchers of beer for $30/each, which felt like a great bargain for both a dining and entertainment experience."}
{"text":"If you love crowded restaurants with great food this is the perfect place. Food is amazing specially the bibimbap. Not a good place to talk because it is an izakaya restaurant :)"}
{"text":"I might be the only person in TO that hated this place. I would never go back. Very long wait for my food, extremely loud atmosphere (gave me a headache), and portions were tiny with a hefty price per plate.  I'd be fine with paying more money for tiny taster portions (I love food, I'd pay for something good and innovative), if the servers would have at least come by to refill my beer while I waited to help keep me full for the 1+hr I waited, but they didn't even check on me.  Loud, hungry and broke after this experience.  I left needing to stop at a mcdonalds cause I was still starving.  The food I had was good, but not at all worth the horridly loud atmosphere, long wait times and awful service.  Too much good food in TO to deal with this shit."}
{"text":"Will be coming back.. often. I came here for my birthday not too long ago. Having been to Guu Garlic in Toronto, I had high expectations that were most certainly met!  Best Dishes: 4/5 Gyu Carpaccio: The thinly sliced beef was delicious in the acidic ponzu sauce.  5/5 Ginadara- Black cod with miso and white wine, favorite dish of the night. It was cooked to perfection, will order again next time! 5/5 Kinoko Bibimbap- hot pot, rice, mushroom, Cheese, seaweed. This dish was a beauty. The cheese just works perfectly with the rice! Highly recommended, even though there is no meat in it. UMAMI HEAVEN!  2/5 Dessert, birthday dessert (which includes one of everything) The desserts were the weakest part of the meal and devoid of flavor. Skip that course and go somewhere else if you want something amazing.  3.5/ Service No big complains, it was a busy night and it was hard for our server to be there every time we wanted them. We ordered the house sake cold, it went down nice. The Ume(plum wine) we ordered wasn't that good, i have had better for that price."}
{"text":"Ok .. quick update. I did go back and brought my mom for a birthday. She did not quite comprehend why 'there was so much noise' but I subject that to her age.  Everything was basically the same in terms of service / ambiance. So I will just discuss the new dishes I tried. I am too tired to lookup the Japanese translation so I am going by English memory: 1) Grilled Squid - Delicious. Highlight. Was not chewy at all. 2) Pancake (okono-yaki) - Blech. Mushy.  Is there even any meat within? 3) Beef Sashimi - Delish. Expensive. Worth it. 4) Scallop Sashimi - What is up with the mayo? All I could taste was MAYO. Pass. 5) Fried Shrimp (Ebifry) - Good. But again, too much mayo. Please spice your dishes up with something besides mayo.  I can't wait to hit up Queen Izakaya next."}
{"text":"Have not been here for almost 2 years and decided to surprise my hubby for an early celebration here. I figured it is hard to take a baby here and this place holds good memories for us.  Our usual staples here are the kinoko bibimbap and kaki mayo. We ordered these plus the kimchi udon and pork cheek steak special. Food was good as usual,\". We very much liked our kaki mayo. This is a couple of bakes oysters with potato, mushroom and topped with cheese. I feel like it had more mayo than potato and mushroom this time though. The kinoko bibimbap and kimchi udon were flavourful and filling. The pork cheek steak was surprisingly good too. The texture was firm but good. The lemon and radish added a depth of flavour to the pork.  Service was just ok, albeit a little slow and a little less friendly than before."}
{"text":"largest beef tower was a joke. it very extra and deceiving. a bowl at the base with beef lined on top. other food was meh. best was the oysters."}
{"text":"As people walked in through the doors - the servers and wait staff would stop what they would do and without fail yell \"Irasshaimase!\"= 'welcome' in Japanese and when people leave, they would pipe up and call out \"Domo Arigato Gozaimashita!!\" - \"thank you very much' adding to the already loud and lively environment at the resto.  Even though we were stuck waiting - it was fun just watching them chant out and how people would react - waving, bowing, merely laughing at the salutations!  We also noticed that the crowd that was at the restaurant was predominantly Asian.  When we finally got our table, we were starving and between the 2 of us - we ordered 11 dishes which we justified as each were very small.   Here are the items that are definitely repeat visit orders for me: - the Japanese green onion pancake- it was thick and crispy and savoury all in one. - the tatoyakis- which are deep fried octopus balls- they are little croquettes that are light and fluffy - just melt in your mouth tapas - we tried 3 different preparations of tatakis or sashimis- the beef, hamachi and salmon- all of which were done very well and had different flavours to them. - the miso black cod- the sauce was sticky and sweet with a subtle taste of chinese cooking wine.  - oysters - they were reminiscent of a savoury oyster rockefellers"}
{"text":"This was my first time at guu and I like the dishes. Yes positions are small but it means you can try a lot more. We had the garlic fried shrimp, seared tuna, octopus, kimchi udon( not enough kimchi) and miso cod. Loved everything but miso cod but that's because I don't love cod. Dessert was green tea creme brûlée"}
{"text":"This is one of those AWESOME restaurants where you KNOW from the second you walk in, that this is going to be a phenomenal meal. The welcome greeting sets the mood that this is going to be fun gosh darnit! The menu is easy to navigate with pictures and descriptions. I recommend ordering as MANY THINGS as you can because everything we had was delicious. Even the tofu was memorable... tofu!  I have flashbacks to this meal; I have reverse PTSD where you keep going back to a memory but its the best memory ever. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go for the longest time, and the wait was worth it!  What a tasty and fun evening!  You can't help but be in a good mood when you're eating at Guu.  The staff are so energetic helpful from the moment you walk in to the moment you leave.  If you're looking for a quiet, intimate evening, look else where.  It is a loud and fun environment, so you better be looking for a good time!  To be honest, I couldn't tell you what I ate.  I gave my friends free range to order whatever they wanted to because I knew it would be delicious.  Highlights were the beef carpaccio, seared tuna and the fish cakes.  I think they'll be my staples the next time I go.  Yes, there is a line up to get in... know that now, and don't hold it against them.  There's a reason for that lineup and it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Most authentic Japanese Izakaya in Toronto.  They even have Japanese staff.  Impressive."}
{"text":"If you like a loud place where the entire staff shouts every time a patron enters or exits, then this is the place for you.  For me, I didn't care for it. Food was so,so as well. I ordered the sukiyaki. Tasted mostly soy sauce in the broth."}
{"text":"Hike!  They copy the atmosphere from the Vanconver; but it turns out to be a pub more than a \"Guu \" it lost the modern Japanese feel For food, there is no comparison with the Vancouver Guu. The only meals were the tataki and Salmon Salad. The rest of the meals were \"bad fusion\" food. I ordered ten different dishes. I only enjoyed two dishes.  I was very looking forward to seeing a Guu in Toronto. But it is very hard to keep the quality for any chain restaurants !   If you want to have parties, this is a good place. But this is not a place for good food!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is lively and welcoming. The food is amazing and the price is very reasonable. I think it's difficult to go without saying that all the Guu locations I've been to, the interior is always so beautiful."}
{"text":"Our family and friends had an AWESOME time and really enjoyed the food and fun atmosphere.  My only suggestion for improvement is to perhaps turn the music volume down just a tad as it is already very lively and loud in the restaurant.  We had a great time!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Guu Izakaya more than I did ... but at the end of the day, my experience didn't measure up to my expectations.  I had no expectations at first.  But a quick Yelp search revealed Guu to be the second most reviewed place in Toronto and also well-received with an average of four stars.  So I was most excited to discover we were only a few blocks away for a possible walk-in.  And what do you know, we were immediately seated at the bar at the last two seats.  When guests first walk in, the waiters raise a huge ruckus in Japanese and the place gets super loud.  But that wasn't too bad as you quickly acclimated to the noise and the frantic environment.  Service was also super efficient and friendly so no fault there.  For me, it was ultimately the food.  Impressions: 1. Salmon Tatto Yukke (chopped sashimi w/ garlic, green onions and mixed with a raw egg yolk).  This one was recommended and seemed to be one of the signature dishes but I wasn't too impressed.  It's basically a salmon version of a beef tartare that you scoop onto nori - but I thought it was way too runny over the thin nori sheets and overly garlicy.  Too messy.  2. Karaage - version here was just ok.  Lacked flavor.  3. Okonomiyaki - typically a favorite dish of mine but the version here was overpowered by the more than generous karashi mayo and tonkatsu sauce.  Way too rich.  4. Kinoko Bibimbap (with mushrooms, cheese and seaweed sauce).  This dish was at least unique, especially with the melted cheese draped over the rice.  Nice earthiness from the mushrooms.  By process of elimination, this was my favorite dish.  They had an interesting strawberry sake that was pretty tasty.  Really liked the energy and look of the place.  But in the end, it was just ok for me.  That won't certainly stop others from coming as by the time we left, there was a pretty long wait of folks outside."}
{"text":"This place is just a good time, all the time. As soon as you enter the restaurant, you're greeted by all the staff in Japanese and the customers as well (who mostly just want to shout along - like I do). The food is great but portions are small. One thing I don't suggest is going on a first date here because the environment is so loud that it'll be hard to hear what your date is even saying.  The space is small and you'll most likely feel a bit suffocated if you're used to lots of elbow room.  I suggest you visit the Guu Sakabar on Bloor since they have more seating space. Come right when they open because this location gets really really busy. You'll most likely see a line up at the door and you'll be stuck waiting for 1.5-2 hours. Wait times might have shortened since the new Guu on Bloor St. has opened though.  This place is a must try if you're into good food and a very lively/energetic environment."}
{"text":"This place is so high quality. This is the best Izakaya in Toronto.  All were good, but the jellyfish was the most interesting. Definitely a lot of fun and would recommend it to anyone looking for a dinner out that is a little bit different then normal."}
{"text":"Contrived and boring menu. Same food at all their locations across Canada. Good for a group - if you want to have a laugh and be loud and not offend other patrons. If you are looking for a serious meal with something that isn't pre-cooked, try somewhere else."}
{"text":"I looooooove this place! It has great food great service and a great atmosphere! Its great for a date, going out with friends-and I have even taken my 3 year old.  She  loved all the cheering and shouting.   Sometimes there is a wait- but it is well worth it! Did I mention how great it was?! :)"}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Toronto! I've been to both locations for more than 10 times and I love this place! The service is superb, food is excellent and the ambiance is definitely energetic! Some people don't like this place because of the noise, but I think anyone would agree that the food is unique and tasty. Suggestions: Pumpkin croquette, baked oyster, beef sashimi, kimchi udon, lobster tail sashimi, bibimbap, brie cheese, and the list goes on..."}
{"text":"First off, when you walk in the whole restaurant turns around and greets you - like a Japanese Cheers. AWESOME! This place is wicked fun, and the food is great.   Typical Izakaya fare (i.e. fried, delicious goodness). The standouts were the baked oysters that were dripping with cheese, and the oysters.   Had a number of mixed drinks, but the sake mojito was by far the best."}
{"text":"I'm a Vancouverite and it was big news to hear that Guu was coming to Toronto. I've been a couple of times and the wait for a table keeps getting longer and longer. On our last visit, we showed up at 5 (opening time) thinking we get in with the first rush. Boy were we wrong, there was already a long line up, i'm guessing people starting around 4:30 or even earlier. We did get seated at 6:30 so a 1.5 hr wait isn't too bad as one girl standing in line showed up at 5 hoping to get a table for 8pm with 12 people.   Toronto Guu has a lot of the original dishes from Vancouver, Karage, Ebi Mayo, Ikura, Odon, etc. Not much is lost with this location as the original chef, Masaru Ogasawara from Vancouver relocated to oversee the location. Great good and pitchers of Sapparo are only $16 and change. Go early and be prepared to wait...but worth it if your craving izakaya."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fun, boisterous evening out with your friends, go to Guu. The staff are always in good spirits and that energy permeates throughout the restaurant.   The menu itself is varied enough to ensure everyone finds something to get excited about and the food is delicious!  One caveat is with the baked oysters. I found them to be overwhelmingly rich to begin with, on top of which they put a layer of cheese.   If you want a quiet evening out, what are you doing at an Izakaya?! For all others, get in here and have some Sake!"}
{"text":"Place is ridiculous - in a good way! I would describe it as gregarious Japanese tapas. Everything I had was good and if you like a little excitement over dinner check this place out. Sometimes a line can develop to get in so be prepared for that possibility."}
{"text":"Cute deco. Friendly passionate Japanese staffs.  I ordered the fish bento, okonomiyaki and cheesecake. The fish bento and the okonomiyaki are average.  The cheesecake together with the cream is amazing.  But I love this little place and they even get pass in the washroom, can you believe it!! I would like to come next time to try their dinner!"}
{"text":"Great food, loud but so funky cool in a Japanese way. Great to go with a few friends, think tapas in Japan. No sushi on this menu."}
{"text":"Guu has such a unique menu. I've been there several times, ordered different dishes and each one of them was so delicious and unusual. I like the fact that their portions are small and cheap, so you can order different things and try. The place is loud, but you feel welcomed and included."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious food, great service, and a fun atmosphere. I come back often and never hesitate to recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I am a different person today because my friends brought me here - good karma for years to them.   I am actually a vegetarian yet the 3 tapas dishes that we ordered were so insanely good that I can't stop thinking about them. This is legit food for soul - I am so happy about my experience.   Everything from the delicious lychee cocktail that I had to the the deep fried brie cheese dish to the coconut ice cream with deep friend bananas as dessert were beyond excellent.   I actually wanted to hug the japanese man who was our server at the end of our meal as he was the most respectful dude ever bowing everytime Japanese tradition would require him too. At the end we all got separate guu postcards where we wrote each other messages and put them in the mailbox to the side of the eating area - speaking of which fantastic eating area, amazing energy from the cooks and the servers - I love how they greet you when you walk in and out.   I am glad I had dinner here because I need to forget over sleep how AMAZING the food here was because nothing I will ever taste again my life will meet the bar that was set tonight  I just I don't know - I am still guushing and I had to share. You have to be here atleast once in your life it's that good"}
{"text":"The ambiance was good if you are under 20 and wanting a party atmosphere. But I have to say, with all of the amazing Japanese fusion restaurants in Toronto, Guu is not even close to the best.   The food is fusion but often with higher fat choices... Lots of fried dishes and sauces.  Good place to go if you aren't interested in talking with your dinner companions."}
{"text":"Consistently great food and drinks, consistently good service, and all in all a better meal than most places twice the price. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing food But long line ups.   Had to wait even though a reservation was made.  Lively atmosphere great to bring friends and family.  Too loud and packed for a dinner date.  Can be pricy but you do get what you pay for.  Definitely unique dining experience."}
{"text":"I'm definitely going here again. The atmosphere was great and the food was amazing. It was a great price as well, around $13 for miso soup, calamari and grilled pork. It didn't seem like much at first but I was full afterwards!  The only thing I didn't like too much was sitting at the bar to eat. Usually I don't do that so maybe I should get used to it.  At first I thought this was a sushi place but nope, it's even better than that."}
{"text":"A restaurant that was recommended both as a best Japanese food spot but also in the church street guide. It lives up to its reputation. Great space, loud happy energetic staff and you smell your food as you enjoy the sites. I tried the Kakimayo (baked oysters) which were cooked well, presented beautifully I their shell with mushrooms, spinach and delicious garlic mayo and cheese. Delicious. Next up Buta Kimchi Bibimbap (with pork). Flavorful and hit all the spots for a bibimbap minus the portion of pork. Nevertheless delicious.  The rest of the food being served looked fresh and delicious and watching the head chef work the kitchen as she oversaw the rest of the staff was priceless. It's a bit pricey but worth the flavors, atmosphere and energy."}
{"text":"I have been to the Guu on Bloor twice, and the Church location once (for lunch). I have never been disappointed with the food, although I prefer the evening sitting in terms of atmosphere.   On a weekend, I think that they only take reservations for the 6pm slot and after that it's first-come, first-served. As such, I would recommend getting there 30-45 minutes before you actually want to eat, putting your name down and going for a drink. Once your table is ready, they will send you a text and you have 15 minutes to arrive  This is hands-down the most 'authentic' izakaya experience I've had outside of Japan. The food is excellent, and the servers are welcoming and gracious. I highly recommend the flame-grilled mackerel dishes, and the yellowtail. It has a great atmosphere, boisterous and lots of fun. Part of this is down to the music, so be aware that it's perhaps not the best option if you're with someone who is hard of hearing."}
{"text":"I have been dining at Guu many times but never was treated like today. The website showed 4pm opening time. So we were there at 4:16pm. The host was rude and told us that he doesn't care what's on the website and that they are open at 4.30pm. We asked if we can take a sit since we are inside anyway, he kicked us out telling to wait 10 min outside, which was not cool since it is quite cold in the middle if December in Toronto. We were shocked by his rude attitude. Don't have any desire to come back again ever."}
{"text":"Recently moved back to Toronto and went there yesterday with great expectation which turned out to be great disappointment. To be fair, the food was ok (but not quite authentic) and prices were relatively reasonable. However, it was so noisy and we found it hard to enjoy the food nor the environment at all. We've been to Japan in the last few years over 20 times covering over 10 cities and been to literally 20-30 izakayas in Japan, none of the ones we visited in Japan had such a uncomfortable noise level. I felt sorry for people who haven't been to the izakayas in Japan and maybe they thought it is all like Guu's. Yes, the \"izakaya\" culture is not a quiet dining place and the servers / waiters / waitresses do greet the customers and chant occasionally, but never have I experienced a level that is consider annoying. There was a moment yesterday that the server was literally screaming right besides my ear when one of the dishes was served to our table, I almost thought I lost my auditory sense of my right ear..... I also saw quite a number of customers (especially those came in families) were clearly irritated and they did what we did, finished the meal in the faster pace possible and got out of there. I can understand if they bumped up the noise a bit on a Friday evening after 9pm or so to tailor for customers looking for that but really puzzled the management decided to keep it at such an intolerable level from 5pm .... O and agreed with other reviewers who mentioned that the restaurant does want their customers to leave as soon as possible and get the next one in queue to come in, which is against the real izakaya culture as well. Every dishes we had (we ordered 5) someone would come and asked if they can take it away literally a few seconds after we finished the last piece of the dishes."}
{"text":"Great noisy and fun atmosphere. Food is still very good. (This is my 6th time here.) One of the servers were very professional and attentive. I did not get his name. He's an asian male.  Only complain: Most of the Sake were out. There were about 10 choices on the main menu but it seemed only 2 were available. Even then, the one we ended up ordering did not have the 2nd bottle available. For a place where it's supposed to be small plates and a drinking place, it's pretty bad that most of the Sake on the menu are not available.  We celebrated a friend's birthday. The Birthday menu and the birthday celebration from the staff was excellent! Fun place with good food."}
{"text":"I've never been one to write long reviews because I don't like reading stuff that drags on too much so let me just say this:  Delicious. All the food I had was tasty. The atmosphere was great too which always helps the dining experience.   What to try? How about everything? The only bad is the loooong wait to get in."}
{"text":"I love the novelty of the place with all the screaming and interesting tapa style dishes . But it can get expensive very quickly . The cheese cream sauce baked oyster is one of my favourites . I have dreams about it . Def a place to hit up once in awhile but the screaming gets too annoying after awhile."}
{"text":"Amazing spot. Easily my favourite.  Great food. I recommend: Tuna tataki. Salmon in second place. Karage (deep fried chicken, comes with mayo sauce on side) Takoyaki (fried squid balls) Konoki Bibimbap (fried rice, mushrooms, cheese +) delicious  Great drinks and cocktails at a decent price.  I recommend: Bamboo sake- huge never ending sake that you pour from a bamboo stops Plum wine- choya. Yum. Large Sapporo. Seriously its big, arm gets tired holding it! but for $10 it's great.  Pretty loud atmosphere- very fun. Do not recommend to go here if you actually want to have a conversation though.  This location does not take reservations (the bloor st location does though!). This place gets BUSY. And you may have to wait..for 2 hours if you get there at peak time. For this reason, each table has a 2 hour seating limit (or less.. cant remember now). The more ppl you have the harder it will be to get a table. Get here before the rush.. and its going to be super busy on they key nights (thur-sat)."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Very lively and friendly and welcoming. Though the restaurant is very loud but that is just the way it is.  The food tastes very fresh and is verrry delicious!  Wait times may vary due to the busy-ness of this place (of course!) You might end up spending quite a bit since most of the menu items are not a full course meal, this place is almost all sharing food of appetizers.  To me I come here with friends as a late night snack. I know there are about 4 birthday specials they have where you do sing happy birthday to you, which is very cool! They also have a few desserts I personally like the almond pudding but that may not be for everyone. I don't think they take reservations, due to the fact that they open in afternoons and they are always packed! (wait time for seating may take long)  Note: not ALL of the staff can speak English fluently but it's good enough! (since it is a very Japanese restaurant)  Overall this place is fantastic! I love this place a lot!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place in the city. It combines great food, a brilliant (unique) atmosphere and is always a great value. The service is always friendly and welcoming. The baked oysters are a must and I get them every time, but otherwise you can't really go wrong. Guu embodies what restaurants should aspire to be. Unpretentious, good food in a fun place."}
{"text":"Guu has recently started offering lunch from Monday to Friday! This is such a great news for us since JW and I are such hardcore fans of Guu. Arriving around 1:30pm, 30 mins before their last order, we were surprised to see the usual-overly-crowded Guu being half emptied. It was quite a view.  Compared to their dinner menu, their lunch menu offers only a limited number of items. All of their dishes came on a tray along with Miso soup and other little dishes. We had three of their dishes:  Saba Miso (simmered mackerel with miso sauce)  :: While mackerel can easily be overcooked and became too dry, Guu's Saba Miso was nicely done. The mackerel absorbed all the flavour in the miso sauce while remained its juiciness and softness. It was delicious!   Gyu Don (Sukiyaki beef on rice topped with half boiled egg)  :: Excuse the half emptied bowl of rice. We were too excited to see the egg lying on top of the sea of beef that we forgot to take a picture until we were half way into it. The half boiled egg \"glued\" the beef and the rice together, creating a very creamy texture. The beef was deliciously tendered and juicy with a strong taste of onion. It was very good.  Chirashi Don (Assorted fresh sashimi on sushi rice)  :: The chirashi don came with salmon, tuna, scallop and salmon caviar. The fish was very fresh.  Nothing really very special though.   Verdict:  Roasted!  :: All the dishes were nicely done and lived up to our expectations. However, it failed to give us that wow factor when we first visited Guu. Nevertheless, it is still a great place to grab a lunch in downtown (A great alternative to all those ramen restaurants in downtown!).  visit http://theroastedacorn.com/2013/05/21/guu-izakaya-lunch/ for pictures of all the awesome food i mentioned above!"}
{"text":"Well. This is certainly a lively place.   I waited for 30 minutes to get in here for dinner. I was only with another friend, so we were waiting for a table for two. I'd imagine it would've been worse if I came with a larger group.  But that's okay. It was worth lining up 30 minutes for.   As so many others have mentioned, upon entering Guu, you're greeted loudly by all the staff. The restaurant itself is full of chatter and loud noises. You can see the cooks at work.   It may be hard for some to imagine such a loud place garnering such high praise from everyone, but it's not like *a child's birthday at McDonald's* loud. It's warm and welcoming.   The food is great too. I recommend the Kaki Furai, Takoyaki, and Kinoko Bibimbap.   Unless you love wasabi, stay away from Takowasabi. That sh*t's strong."}
{"text":"Love the food,  the atmosphere ( one of a kind) and the friendly staff.  Everything here is fresh and delicious.  We love the udon,  oyster,  and sampling of sushi at guu. Place gets so packed,  hard to find space in the evenings"}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent and pricing was fair. Horse tartar was a bit bland but everything else was pleasing to the palate. Customer service was on par. Only complaint is that they don't service to younger kids. We brought our 18 month old and they don't have high chairs or boosters. We were told by our server that he doesn't recommend bringing small children to izakayas. This is a new statement for me. Been to other izakayas and no issues."}
{"text":"The food here is soo delicious! I really like the eggplant dish (I have forgotten the name...) However, I think the portions are a bit small and meager.  The atmosphere was a unique experience. The staff members shout in Japanese when you come and leave, and every 5 seconds while you are eating. Although it made the restaurant lively and energetic, it kind of got irritating after awhile. Plus, I had to shout in order for others to hear. I really don't think this is good for any type of first dates, or intimacy.. Overall, I still would come back for the delicious food! :)"}
{"text":"Japanese gods gift to white Americans hahahaa.  There is only GOOD to say about this place. From the amazing atmosphere to the energetic and helpful staff, there was not one second that passed in which I wasn't in AWE of the food and ambiance.  If you are looking for an authentic Japanese outing, this is your baby!  I recommend getting the Shashimi Salad and hand rolls, nom nom nom  Be prepared to walk through the door and have the whole restaurant yell at you."}
{"text":"Glorious!  Unlike every other Japanese style restaurant in Toronto, Guu is definitely an experience with its decor to the way it greets its customers.  More importantly, the food was divine and the Japanese wine was unlike other wines I have tasted.    As Will mentioned, the dishes span from $4-$11.  In my party of 8 people, we ended up ordering I think 3/4ths of the menu + alcohol.  Unfortunately, I came in after my party ordered (I was running late), hence from my pictures I have no idea what dishes we actually ordered.  Altogether, our bill came out to approximately $250 which I thought was reasonable considering how much food we all ate.  Surprisingly, we all cleared our plates but suffered (at least I did) a bout of food coma.  I will definitely be back for another round."}
{"text":"In terms of atmosphere, there is nothing like it. It was lively, loud, but not grating on the nerves. The waiters are amazing, wonderful people and you are always attended to.  The food is decent, but a little bit pricey for what you get. Drinks, unsurprisingly, are top-notch. All in all, it's a fun experience. I wouldn't recommend going with large groups though, you will never be able to hear the conversation at the other end of the table!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great service. Loud. Crowded, but expected in a Izakaya. Had a wonderful time here."}
{"text":"Food there is amazing, however my friend has a large appetite so we spent a lot of money in it. And it is tooooo noisy in it so my friend and i can hardly hear what each other said during the conversition."}
{"text":"I like this place. Kind of small which sucks because waiting time. They had a waiting area but I think that's their summer tables. It's a couple of tables outside. We sat outside and waited for about 30 minutes which is pretty good considering they were so busy. There is a coat rack type of thing when you first enter. It's because it's kind of warm in there. Food was pretty good. Loved the energy of the people working there the most. It looks like they were having lots of fun and not really working!"}
{"text":"Food: 5 Service: 3 Ambiance: 4 Overall: 4  Order: Kaarage, takoyaki, deep fried brie cheese, deep fried calamari (ikapiri), BBQ pork, sesame ice-cream, Sapporo & one of their drink specials.  I also loved the energy and excitement all around their restaurant, especially around their open-kitchen. Mind you, this isn't the place for a quiet conversation as you sometimes have to yell at the people right next to you to try to have a conversation.  No doubt about it, the food is simply good and well executed. Each dish has its own unique flavour profile that brings all the different traditional japanese flavours together without clashing in your mouth. We honestly wanted to order more but we ate street meat a few hours before our reservation since we were so hungry. We won't make the same mistake next time.   Stand outs: The deep fried calamari was full of flavour and just spicy enough for the palate. The BBQ pork was oh-so-tender. Kaarage was done just right, but then again I love Japanese fried chicken wherever I go, lol.  The only qualm I have with this place is that there was a 30+ minute wait in-between our second-last dish and our last dish. It was really hard not to be frustrated at our server since she was so nice and kept apologize every 10 mins or so. I seriously don't think it should take that long to prepare takoyaki. Sigh...  Regardless, I'm still looking forward to coming back and trying the rest of their menu. Portions are small but the flavours pack a punch!"}
{"text":"Two words - F-ing delicious!  I love Japanese food, I could eat sushi every day. But this place is so different, in a good way! Everything we ordered (aside from the slightly bland hot pot thing) was so delicious and different from a regular, run-of-the-mill Japanese restaurant (no sushi, terryaki or tempura here!).  I can't say anything bad: friendly staff who yell at you when you come in or out of the building (so NOT a quite, romantic place), big, long, wood tables, great decor, delicious drinks and incredible food. Go with a few people, that way you can try a bit of everything!  Here's what I ate in order of awesomeness:  Kimchi Bibimbap Soy sauce marinated, deep-fried chicken Deep fried eggplant in miso sauce Blanched spinach with sesame sauce Grilled black cod Salt + Pepper beef short ribs Hot pot w/egg, radish and fish cake  I also had the Lulu Melon drink which was delish!  Now I am hungry :)"}
{"text":"4 stars for the experience.  The food is tasty but nothing that stands out (except maybe the kinoko bibimbap - rice, mushrooms, cheese, seaweed in a sizzling stone bowl).  Great if you don't mind deep fried foods and mayo-based sauces.  It was definitely a fun and loud atmosphere - it's not a place you want to go for a quick bite or a romantic date.  Even though it was packed, it was not hard to flag a waitress.  She had surprisingly good memory because she knew exactly which dish was ordered.  Very busy - went there on a Monday night around 7:30pm and there was still a line-up.  We left at 9:30pm and there were still people waiting at the door as well.  The portions are quite small so the final bill ends up expensive.  We went with 10 people and we each paid about $40."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and awesome food! I felt very welcomed and the food was PERFECT!! Especially the Bibimpap; they were much better than the ones I had in Korea!"}
{"text":"OMG!! This place is amazing. We are visiting from NYC and this is by far the best sushi place we have ever been to. The staff is very friendly and it soooo much fun!! They are so interactive. I love this place. I wish they had places like this in NYC!!!!"}
{"text":"First stop after landing in Toronto, partially by chance and partially by choice. BTW this place is right next to a ramen place so don't be confused. This place is very fun, I went during lunchtime so not as loud the staff is really friendly and the food is fun small plates. We got the ramen with soy sauce broth, cheesey oysters with mushrooms and garlic, takiyaki balls, and a small karage chicken bowl, a big mug of beer for him and a drink call \"lulu apple\" for me. I like lululemon and this drink was as girly as it gets, very yummy! Stop by if you want a casual fun time with just good simple maybe not so healthy eats. Oh and they have seating outside too :)  #ccawentures"}
{"text":"What a fun and exciting venue to eat in.  The atmosphere is loud and crazy, so don't come here on a first date.  The tapas styled menu was different and delectable.  A must try for the adventurous type."}
{"text":"Wish you can make reservations and the waits aren't as long. Love the Tonkasu ramen which is on its special menu during the colder months. Most items on the menu are good. My favorite mainstay items are the seared tuna and the guu beef carpaccio. Least favorite might be the miso blacken cod, it is too salty and texture too mushy for my liking. Very loud and great to go with a 4-5 friends to share dishes with, just prepare them for at least a 1hr wait during peak time."}
{"text":"I love this place! The greeting is quite overwhelming because they will greet you in such a festive way. The place is beautiful and I must say is quite authentic.  The waitress is pleasing and served us well. Even when we came at a very busy time our food arrived faster than we expected. It is not your typical sushi place since there are more exotic varieties to choose from. I recommend the Japanese pancake and the oysters.  I will come back here again and to those who wants to dine here, the place is very busy so book a reservation."}
{"text":"AMAZZZING! Love all their stuff. Every time I go I try something new. It's all been very tasty so far. I would highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"I am from Vancouver so I know my sushi!  Vancouver is also home to 3 different Guu restaurants.  When I moved to Toronto, I was so pleased to find out that Guu existed here amongst the all you can eat places to the overly prices places.    Bottom line, Guu has consistent food, service and affordable prices.  The washrooms are always clean and have mouthwash, sanitary pads, hand cream, toothpicks accompanied by traditional, dramatic Japanese music to make your bathroom experience much more pleasurable.  Food is fresh, on point, service friendly and efficient.  Just don't expect to get a table right away on a Friday night with a group of people.  Common sense, if a place doesn't take reservations and it's popular, show up early or be prepared to wait.  It is 100% worth the wait."}
{"text":"My first time at guu! Service and food are excellent! ! A lil too noisy for guest who wanna chat, but really makes u feel like ur not in Toronto!! The place is quite hidden, a little hard to find without gps. The food portion is small but price for each is like around 7..so still reasonable! A real gem!"}
{"text":"Ever since GUU got rebranded to Kinka, I feel like the quality for some of the food just isn't the same.   Yes, the menu was basically unchanged, but the I have been enough times to be able to tell the differences in some of the same dishes ordered. Beef tataki was not as fresh. The oyster, though still arriving in its shell was more potato and less oyster.   Don't get me wrong, the food is still good, it's just not my number one izakaya anymore."}
{"text":"It's a hip place to go in Toronto, and great atmosphere!!! The food, however, I found most of them are tend to be too sweet. Sweetness itself is not a problem in general, and we all love candy, don't we?! But if the food only has sweet flavor in it, that means at the same time it is lacking the actual true flavor from the food. At the end, I'm not  not looking for fast-food type meal in an Izakaya.  In short, if you are looking for great atmosphere, Guu is the number one choice!"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner. They had our table reserved and ready for us upon our arrival; we didn't need to wait despite there being several guests at the door. Throughout dinner, it was VERY loud, so probably not the ideal \"quiet date night\". (Though I find that's what gives this restaurant that unique character). Their menu is quite extensive but we opted for the $35 tasting menu. It was deeeeelicious. It was more than enough for 2 to share that we had to pack the last two dishes. Everything was tasty but what really stood out were the cheesy stuffed oysters, the salmon tataki and okonomiyaki (a Japanese pancake). The short ribs were just okay, slightly overcooked. The menu also included your choice of 3 ice creams and we chose black sesame; I've had better. Their lychee mojito however, was flawless. The waiters were attentive and kind. We will definitely be returning to try their other good stuff. It's an easy 4 stars for me  -  friendly service, delicious food and authenticity! :)"}
{"text":"Great food, staff, atmosphere, and drinks. Worth the wait on any given night.   Beef Carpaccio, Udon, and Oden are quite good."}
{"text":"wow. I gave them only 4 stars? UPDATE: Guu owns. Every other Izakaya in TO has nothing on them. We go all the time and it keeps getting better. *****"}
{"text":"I'll never tire of this place. The food is cheap, the drinks are cheap, and the atmosphere is loud and lively.   I strongly recommend the following dishes: Takowasabi, Kurage, Sashimi Salad, Maguro Tataki, Hotate Carpaccio, Spicy Negitoro, Ekapiri, and Gindara. Also, load up on their specials! They offer great sashimi options, my favorite so far has been the whole mackerel. NOW, if you have to try only one thing here, I would recommend the Ekapiri. It's insane and I usually don't leave without eating 2.   The standard drink here seems to be giant mugs of Sapporo, which are hard to lift BTW, but I recommend trying the Nama Grapefruit cocktail and the Ramune Mojito.   Actually, upon further inspection.. the first doesn't seem to be on the menu anymore, and the ramune mojito seems to be non-alcoholic now!! So much for that recommendation.."}
{"text":"Food and staffs are one of world best.  It was good impress to visit Toronto. Thank you Kinka. I'll definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Look, the food here is really delicious.   My husband and I shared the gomaae (spinach with black sesame sauce), unagi doria (eel rice with cheese), okra tempura, karubi (short ribs), teriyaki gyu tongue, kakimayo (baked oyster), gindara (black cod), lobster tempura (on special) and banana tempura for dessert. I would recommend all of nine these dishes. The portions are pretty small for the most part so we were satisfied but not stuffed.  So why only three stars? Well, this was the fastest $120 meal (incl. soft drinks, tax and 20% tip) that we've ever eaten. We arrived at 5:30 on a Saturday night, which used to mean a full house and the beginnings of a line-up a few years back. The place was at most half full by the time we left. Our food came out really quickly -- too quickly, because we felt rushed to clear some room on our table as the plates piled up. All told, we were in and out in 45 minutes.  So yeah, the food is great and I'm sure I'll return for more but the rating reflects that I expect a better dining experience when spending over $50 per person."}
{"text":"The food isn't phenomenal and due to its sheer popularity, Guu is somewhat overrated.  However, the atmosphere is amazing and it is an awesome place to go with friends. Would rather spend $20-30 here for a night out than at some crap chain place.  Love the open kitchen, and love to see the chefs having fun preparing the food."}
{"text":"my friend who is a publicist was raving about this place. Normally when someone raves or talks non-stop about a place, you eventually tune out -- not about Guu  Okay so there is a line - it's because people want to get some amazingness.  My advice is to put your name on the list and go across to bulldog and have a coffee pre-dinner then go back and definitely go with a bunch of people  So reasonably priced for what we ate.  yum!"}
{"text":"My friend and I and  went in yesterday and walked out in 5 minutes. It was ridiculous and I couldn't believe what I heard from the waitress at the reception. Here is what happened. We walked in and it was not full and saw a empty table (seats) We asked for a table for 2. She said 10-15 minutes. I said that's fine and gave her my mane. I could see there was no waiting list other than us on the book. Since we saw the empty table I asked her what's the hold up. She said she had to clean the table. Then she also said \" You can wait out side\" My friend and I waited by the reception desk because it was not busy there and  we were not blocking anyone at the door. And it was raining outside. She came back to us and asked \" You have to wait outside\" I said \" Ya, but it's raining outside!\"  My friend I looked at each other and couldn't believe what she said and her rude attitude. We totally lost an appetite.  I don't care how good the food there could have been, if we stayed there. The service from this particular staff was as low as it can get."}
{"text":"It's been one of my favourite spots in the city for a while. Formerly known as Ginza this Japanese eatery is a fun place to spend a Saturday night. I've never been to Japan but it feels and looks very Japanese. The food is really hit and miss: some of the dishes are fantastic and some are just horrible. So choose wisely :) My personal favourites are: beef ribs, tartar (both tuna and beef), octopus balls. Plum wine and sake are must try as well)"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing vibe, amazing staff! We had the party menu B and everything was delicious. Kinka never dissapoints!"}
{"text":"Want a place with tons of positive energy, activity and good food? Went here for dinner. Hopping place even on a Monday night. Its Japanese tapas with a fun, casual vibe. Had so much fun watching all the dishes being served. Will definitely go back - about 20 more things I want to try. Green tea cake - OMG! :)  OMG So fun!\""}
{"text":"Atmosphere + food was amazing, nothing like any where else. The chefs and waitresses are top-notch and they shout and crack jokes all the time in Japanese! Everyone has a fun time there.  Good place for a date.  Just remember to get there early b/c it is usually packed!"}
{"text":"Have been more to the one in Gastown (Vancouver) but have enjoyed this one many time since moving back home. I love the chaos, the food, the price point is decent. This is definitely on the repeat list.   I don't know that I have favourite menu options since I typically go in a group that is amenable to the let's share everything mentality. I do feel that is a compliment in and of itself though, if you feel comfortable wandering in and feel the entire menu is accessible. Except the 7 sisters (def in Vancouver, not sure if in Toronto) I genuinely can (and will) eat anything but femented soy is not my palate pleaser.   I'd take anyone here from someone who eats Japanses/izakaya on the regular to a more timid restaurant goer."}
{"text":"Food is very salty, small portion. But stuff here are friendly. This place is very loud and unique."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere but for those who have experienced Guu in Vancouver, the menu is not as extensive"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food, atmosphere and service.   I prefer the church location but am easily persuaded into either as I love the food regardless of location."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience at Guu. Having never been to Japan, something about the atmosphere made me feel like I was there - adding a very nice touch to my overall experience.  I wouldn't recommend going in a group larger than 4. There are no reservations, and operates as a first-come, first-serve basis. You basically have to get your name on the list and wait until they call your group. For my group of 4, we ended up waiting nearly 2 hours - but it was worth it! Mind you, you can't wait inside...   As you enter and leave, you're greeted very loudly and happily by all the staff. The restaurant is fairly small, but is decorated very nicely. Their \"chandelier\" of many bulbs is definitely worth taking a photo of.   The food portioning is small and a bit expensive, but very delicious. I believe each dish is meant to be shared, so you will probably end up getting 4-5 dishes (at least). For the atmosphere and food, it's definitely one of the restaurants in Toronto to give a try!  For my group of 4, it came out to about $60pp. This includes an alcoholic beverage for each and probably 7-9 dishes. For a shorter wait time, I'd recommend either going very early (6pm onwards) or towards the end of the night (9:30pm onwards)."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. The overall environment at Guu is loud, fun, and exciting! From the moment you step into the restaurant you are greeted with a warm welcome to when you exit the restaurant. The food and the drinks at Guu are the absolute best! They do not come in large dishes, but they offer a variety of unique Japanese dishes. My personal favourite is the Hotate Carpaccio (hokkaido scallop sashimi with wasabi dressing) - that is to die for! Followed by the Maguro Tataki (seared B.C. tuna sashimi), and the Salmon Tataki (seared salmon sashimi) which I love both equally. If you are not a fan of raw food, Guu offers a wide range of grilled and deep fried dishes as well from deep friend shrimp to grilled oysters. In addition to the delicious food, Guu's drink menu is quite amazing as well. I love their mixers. I would recommend trying, \"Bamboo\", it has a very light and refreshing taste, the alcohol in it is not overpowering, and perfect for the summer! Although, the food there is great, sometimes Guu does tend to get a little nosier than I normally like, other then that, it's a fun environment to enjoy food good and good company!"}
{"text":"First of all, food is amazing! We had the Kimchi Udon, Kinoko Bibimbab, Kakimayo (baked oysters), and the Unagi Doria (BBQ water eel). Really liked all the dishes, but my favourites were the Kinoko Bibimbab and the Unagi Doria. I wished the serving sizes were a little bigger (however the four dishes were split between my two cousins and I).   We spent 45 minutes looking for this place (bc we weren't familiar with the area), all the while being soaked by the rain. However, it was worth it! We went before they opened, and asked if we could use to their bathroom. They were so considerate and kindly let us in, but we couldn't sit down and order ahead of time (obviously lol!), so we spent that extra time at a coffee shop until they opened.  We went on Saturday (and they open at 4:30PM), we got there at 4:34PM and a line was starting to form! So I knew this place was going to be good. When we walked in, all the employees greeted and cheered us in Japanese, and would yell out our orders (not harshly though). All the employees were super friendly, and the atmosphere was great! They have a pretty epic birthday song (if you go on your birthday), all the employees stop what their doing temporarily and take out instruments and sing LOL! They all yelled and cheered us goodbye when we left. Definitely will come back again! And will definitely recommend this place.  One thing you should do ahead of time is making a reservation, even though you can walk in, there might not be any tables (bc it gets packed). My cousins and I sat at the bar facing the cooks. So if you want a table, call ahead of time! :)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is unique. A small place with communal tables. All the staff greet you as you walk in. It was a bit loud and hard to converse with friends.  We were there 20min before opening and there is a line already forming outside. We made it on the first seating, so, wasn't too bad but I have heard people wait an hour in line.   Food was pretty good...but is it worth waiting an hour in line? Not for me...but my boyfriend like it and would go back again."}
{"text":"I have to say that I didn't go to a restaurant for long with every single dish that I can rate to be superb.  Not only is the food but the atmosphere is so hipster.  Once you step in the restaurant, all staff will shout loud to greet you as though I am in Japan.   There is no reservation available.  We wait for about 45 minutes before seats are available.  Most of the tables are long benches to be shared by groups.  Sashimi salad is tasty but there is only tiny sashimi mixed with the salad.  Treasure hunt begins.  The reward winner is the last to have the salad at the bottom.  Takowasabi is thin slice of Octopus with the sauce makes it so fresh for the taste buds to try other dishes  Saba Shioyaki (grilled mackerel) no fish stinky smell at all and is just right for the fish to be tender  Kaki mayo is the Rocketfeller baked oysters that you really want to order more   Buta Kimchi Bibimbap with the heated bowl that seldom did you find the server will stir it for you.    Karubi is pork spare ribs that is juicy inside and dry outside that it provides a different taste of sensation  Ebi mayo is the deep fried prawn comes with 6 medium size prawn with very light batter and the shrimp meat is elastically fresh  Hotate Carpaccio is the scallop sashimi is one of a kind  Salmon Tataki, hokke and .... too many to mention and they are all exceptionally good.  Must try!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great! Be prepared for a loud night. The food is amazing, the cocktails are a must-try!"}
{"text":"it was ok-ish, maybe i just had too high of expectations but the portions are definitely small and for sharing. it's always good to try new things ( like i did with the octupus pancake thingy) but yeah, it's definitely something new. i would suggest it for people that like to try new food"}
{"text":"We waited from 6:51 pm to 7:41pm and didn't get our order...until we complained...bad first impression. On a better day, we should hope the service would be better. After we complained about the wait, the waitress realized she had given our food to the table behind us about 15 mins ago. Then she proceeded to tell us that we'd have to wait 15 more minutes (so now it would be a total of 1h and 5mins) until a new dish could be made. We waited...and were still charged...no freebies there. Food was alright. Oh and the drinks were HEAVY on the ice. Watered down. (Ice cubes jammed from the top to the middle of the cup). Maybe next time..."}
{"text":"Always a fun time at Guu and a great place to take out of town guests for great food and a unique dining experience.   Some standout dishes: - Gommae - spinach with an insanely delicious sauce -- one of my favourites (10/10) - Salmon Tatake (9/10) - Kabocha Karroke - pumpkin croquette with a hard boiled egg inside (9/10) - Brie Cheese (10/10) - Kinoko Bibimbap (10/10) - Gindara - awesome black cod (10/10)  Always great nightly specials on Sake! \"Ghan-pie!\" (cheers!)"}
{"text":"Just the best time, super fun, great food and super reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"I started the night out by having high expectations because of all the great things my friends told me about Guu, but they were blown out of the roof when I finished my meal.   My friend insisted that because we went  to the restaurant around 5:30, we'd have to wait around an hour. As luck would have it (and probably because it was only the two of us), there was a free two-seater table as soon as we got in! The first thing that struck me was the atmosphere of the restaurant. I can't possibly describe it well enough to do justice, but it's vibrant, high-energy, and very refreshing after walking in from a snow storm. All the waiters are extremely friendly, and you can hear throughout the night various cries of \"Welcome!\" and \"Good bye!\" as customers enter and leave the place.   I was also warned about the small portions of food, but to be honest, I was full after 5 dishes (split between my friend and I). We had the Salmon Natto Yukke, which turned out to be my favourite dish of the night and my highest recommendation. I don't know how chopped salmon sashimi with other vegetables mixed with raw egg then stirred and eaten with nori (seaweed) would taste good, but it tasted amazing! We also had the Ebimayo, deep fried prawns with mayo -- very nicely fried, not too heavy. The Kakimayo, grilled oyster, was perfectly cooked and the sauce on top was delicious. Yakiudon was very nicely flavoured with dashi (fish stock). We also had a dish similar to popcorn chicken, pretty typical but nevertheless still tasted amazing.   I fully enjoyed the entire experience; the atmosphere, the service, the food -- nothing was a negative for me. Having the entire staff wave and yell \"Thank you and good bye!\" as we left only ensured that we'd be back sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place for the atmosphere, food and service! I stumbled across this place randomly, and while it looks like a completely abandoned restaurant from the outside (being winter and all), it turned out to be an amazing restaurant with an incredible vibe! The staff were awesome who really got you into the mix of things, the food was excellent with the creativity and taste put into it, and the music played was also neat that I enjoyed. Definitely something to check out if you're into trying Japanese Tapas."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, service was quick and helpful. If you are looking to be adventurous with new foods try it here."}
{"text":"Tasted good, but I'm not sure it was worth the price. Very popular restaurant so naturally, a long wait time. Very small portions so I left hungry with a depleted wallet."}
{"text":"It's very good! It's be best experience ever. I love their service! I moment you walk in you can feel their warmth by yelling out in Japanese \"welcome!\". You would feel like you're in Japan! I love it! The waiters also know what they're doing. The waiter who served us recommended us dishes on the menu and also the best sake to accommodate our food. It was excellent! It's worth to wait in line for those who are wondering! I can eat it everyday!"}
{"text":"I've tried tonight for the first time this new place and I definitely found my new spot for dinner with friends on a Tuesday evening. When you come in everybody greats you in choir with a welcome in Japanese (I suppose, hopefully they don't say something bad you can't understand LOL), the sitting is really fun so basically you get to sit with a bunch of people you never met before and hearing all their conversation and actually make new friends. Coming in with a date not to worry they have couples sitting too. The menu is very different from every other Japanese places I've been before and they actually don't carry sushi -unless for a specific night or change of the menu or special- but they have really typical delicious Japanese dishes. The servers are really helpful also in giving you advices of what to choose also for a specific mood you are in that night. My friends came here many times and never been disappointed. And I can say the same. It is really a cool place."}
{"text":"I will definitely be making a return visit. I never thought I would say that cod would be my favourite part of a Japanese meal, but the gindara was so delicious! Melt in your mouth and full of flavour. I also really enjoyed the hotate carpaccio, karaage and almond tofu. I could have drank the black sesame dressing on the salad. The service was fast despite it being a full house and the staff was energetic and friendly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food is good and the noise level is probably 2-3x what it is in the Guus in Vancouver. I love izakayas for the innovation but having not come back for a few years, the menu looked pretty standard and unchanged. Still the quality of the food is good...just be prepared to lose your voice or not really be able to hold a conversation :)"}
{"text":"Izakaya restaurants are a whole experience unto themselves! I decided to eat here after reading all the wonderful reviews on yelp. Unfortunately for me, the experience wasn't worth five stars. Firstly, this place is more boisterous than other Izakaya restaurants that I've been to. While I enjoy the bustle and activity, I think it was over the top here. Secondly, service wasn't that good. We weren't able to find our server at times when we wanted to get something. As for the food, the Tofu salad, and pork wrapped in puff pastry were definite favourites. The egg wrapped in pumpkin or squash was quite bad. It was a soggy concoction that had some thousand island type dressing on the top, which I wasn't a fan of at all."}
{"text":"The place is really clean, but I wish it were bigger. It felt kind of crowded and so I wouldn't recommend it as a catch-up-with-friends sort of occasion. The portions are quite small, but the food is good :)"}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto and will never visit again without hitting Guu.  Incredible experience.  Incredible food: oysters, sashimi salad, miso soup (best I've ever had), hot sake, green tea ice cream, and hot tea.  And all for about $30.  I'd do it all over again and again.  Thank you Guu!"}
{"text":"Ambiance marrante, cuisine originale, très (très) bon, options vegan assez nombreuses, prix raisonnables. Les épinards à la crème de sésame noir sont une tuerie, le bouillon au tofu pané aussi !"}
{"text":"Super busy, super crowded,  super good! There's a guud vibes special that you can request... I am curious if anyone is brave enough please request it and tell me all about it! There's a lineup so leave your number and wait st loblaws or Starbucks nearby."}
{"text":"I've been here about a gazillion times, and have tried numerous other izakaya places in Toronto. I'm just going to say it, Guu is still the best.   Also, original Guu location on church is better than the sake bar location on bloor.   Fool proof dishes: baked oyster, tuna tataki, black cod, kerage, mushroom and cheese bibimpap, beef tongue, and almond tofu.   Only thing I don't like is that it gets way too loud. I can barely hear people I go with. So I usually just sit there and eat. I suggest sitting on the patio in the summer.   And in terms of getting a seat. They never used to take reservations (I'm not sure if it's changed), but come at 5pm (when they open) or 9pm (last call for food is 10pm) to get seated immediately. 7-8pm you'll be looking at at least 1 h on Fri/Sat/Sun.   Happy eating."}
{"text":"every frikkin thing on the menu is absolutely delicious!  a real food experience...  brownie points for the huge jugs of Sapparo (9$ only) and desserts!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is good, it is a beautiful place to have a talk with friends. We ordered Tan Tan Men and slow-cooked beef with rice, they are just so so."}
{"text":"Finally got into Guu. Went there on Mon. Night and it wasn't that busy. We got a seat in front of the bar. Our waiter was super sweet and nice, he suggested some good dishes. We had grilled oysters, the eggplant, a salad with beef (dont remember the name) the dressing on the salad was amazing, tangy flavourful and you could smell the sesame. We also had the squid with spicy ketchup sauce, it was good and spicy however the grilled oysters were the best. The drinks were fun especially since we had to squeeze our own grapefruit! For dessert we had the almond tofu...YUM again so flavourful and im not a big fan of tofu! The staff were fun and very friendly. Overall it was very good and just as expected, you definetly have to go prepared that there is going to be a lot of noise and you'll be alright."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Japanese restaurant in Toronto! All the dishes were delicious, my favorite was the miso cod. It was sweet and the fish was buttery and melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but very loud!!  Food was excellent!!  Seats are a little uncomfortable though."}
{"text":"Have a reservation if you want to sit down inside, otherwise come early - but you still might be relegated to the patio. We sat at the bar and watched the chefs create their masterpieces and ordered whatever looked good. It's tapas style so best to get a bunch of plates and share.  Would recommend, in particular: raw fish/sashimis, octopus salad appetizer, pork belly, fried Brie.  We didn't like the baked oysters. There was too much mayo and the oysters got lost in the mixture.  Overall, very authentic, lively atmosphere, unique dining experience!"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Overhyped. Great if you've never been to an izakaya before.   I know that 'real' Japanese restaurants are hard to find in Toronto, but come on. Just because the waiters are Japanese and shout Japanese doesn't mean it is actually 100% Japanese - seriously, it's not that hard to hire Japanese staff. This is no indication of 'authentic' Japanese-ness. The food is clearly fusion (I mean, deep fried brie?) and whatever traditional Japanese izakaya dish it does make is lackluster. If you want even a decent sampling of the menu and drinks it's going to cost you upwards of $30+ person. It's not worth the two hour wait. Also, good luck trying to have a decent conversation.  Unfortunately I don't have any other good izakaya recommendations for Toronto. Oops. Guess you have to go to New York. Hence the three stars - three stars for Toronto."}
{"text":"this was once of my most anticipated toronto meals -- i had been dreaming of coming here for months. lets start with the simple fact that my name is iza, and my sisters name is kaya. no seriously, not kidding. you can imagine our delight when we learned of this great japanese restaurant style called izakaya!   we happened to be 3, and we were seated instantly! (even though it was crowded and already a line forming around the door) (yes communal tables!!). we wanted to try a variety, some bold flavors, stuff you don't see often.   we had  torowasabi - cooked octopus with wasabi stems *faaavorite*  hotate carpaccio - thin slices of scallops in a mayo-ey dressing (good fresh flavors, not that exciting on the exotic scale)  tokoyaki - squid balls, deep fried, served with mustardy sauce  kabocha korokke - hard boiled egg, surrounded by pumpkin puree and deep fried served with spicy mayo  pig intestines in spicy garlic sauce (my first time eating pig intestines.. way chewier than i imagined, and had a flavor of pork fat, but the sauce was delicious)  green tea cheese cake (tiiiiny tiny slice. but very loved.)   all was delicious. some more than others. for sure try the torowasabi and pumpkin egg. the atmosphere is fun, and alive, you are greeted at the door with yelps and screams from all the servers and chefs, and they all wave good bye on your way out! honestly i wish we could have eaten more."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to have group dinners in all of Toronto. The atmosphere is great, the staff is welcoming and has a lot of fun. and the food is outrageously delicious.   If it's your first time I highly recommend the deep fried brie cheese. It was so good the first time me and my friends went there we ordered it three times."}
{"text":"Came here for Kinkalicious. I booked in advance and when I arrived, I found a card with my name and thanking me for my reservation. That was a nice touch. The food was very tasty and came so quickly. All that for $29. Usually I avoid Kinka since I found it too loud. It was still loud, but maybe because I expect it, I was alright with it."}
{"text":"I've been to Guu 4 times because I love their food! I loved everything I tried there, my favourites are the seaweed/mushroom rice and the pumplin with an egg in it. It's so unique and the flavours are wonderfully meshed together.   I even celebrated my birthday there. I bought the 'cake + song' on the menu and a group of them were singing to me in English and Japanese and dancing (haha). It was great fun to have my birthday there.  Not to mention the way they greet you when you enter! Full of energy and enthusiasm. I love it."}
{"text":"I have been there few times and I found that it is a bit noisy environment for me to enjoy. But, it definitely has a good vibe, and Japanese hospitality. All the dish is quite good but the portion is a bit small like other Japanese places."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Japanese food.  With all the reviews.. I got to try this place.  I have to say, I am not overwhelm.  Hands down a place is fun and welcoming.  If you are with a big group of friends for some beers.. this is perfect.  The grill black cod - 10 stars!!! melt in your mouth.. one of the best I had Rest of the items is only average (ribs = soso tuna Tartar = below soso Takoyaki = very far off marks.  The one I had in Osaka is 10 points.. they are around 4.  I expected to be high 7 or 8.    Noise level is very high - in case you are bring young ones."}
{"text":"It's not a bad place. Nice and urban.Amazing atmosphere and good service. Their food is unique and fresh. That's what I really like about. If you don't like crowd, don't go there. It's one of the hotspot. You might end up being piss off at your life how unimportant you are!  However, I feel like this is one time thing. It's nice to try but won't go there over and over.   Tapas are too expensive for my taste -_- #brokelife But if you wanna wear your fancy panty and go there for your first date to impress, not that bad."}
{"text":"My first Yelp review ever, and starting here because it was so good.  Everything I expected based on the 1000+ reviews.  Extremely fun, great variety of food to sample.  Yeah, loud, but that was part of the fun.  Staff was so, so friendly and helpful (hostess - Kanaca? was so energetic - loved her).  Saki-bombs - more fun.  Any next trip to Toronto will include Kinka Izakaya."}
{"text":"If you don't mind being yelled at, this place is a very excellent choice if you're in downtown Toronto.  The service was probably average but the food though was A+ trending towards excellence.  *They made some of the best of lobster tempura I've ever had. *Go as a group and order a lot of stuff to try. *Fried brie is great  I've been twice now and the only drawback is the noise and lines."}
{"text":"One of the better if not best izakaya places in Toronto. However because of the small portions, things can get expensive quickly. Come as a group so you can try more things, the menu is definitely worth exploring. Be sure to get the udon, fried rice and black sesame spinach. Best things I've had on the menu so far.  Staff is super enthusiastic and take izakaya experience to another level.  Make reservations!"}
{"text":"So everyone screams when someone walks in and when someone leaves....is it bad that the thing that sets the place apart I found too loud. I swear im not old but for me it was too much going on.  Food was really great and looked cute too(always a plus). The place gets really crowded so expect to wait. We ended up sitting at the bar and it was nice. My friend loved everything that was going on so I guess it's hit and miss? The drinks are cute!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great, but pricey for the portions. Atmosphere is noisy. Good for drinks and a casual meal."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Guu for a year, and I am happy to say that their food has remained extremely delicious just like how I remembered it. I have always loved going to Guu on special occasions, and when I go I expect screaming and yelling and feeling embarrassed in front of a room full of people (regulars will know what I'm talking about) so noise has never really been a real issue for me. However, I did notice that there are more employees working at this Guu from I last came so with more people yelling, the noise level is actually past my comfort level and my expectations.  My main issue is with the watered-down drinks and the service. Our table ordered the Lychee Mojito and the Peach Mojito, and both tasted very bland and watered-down. Yes I taste the bitterness of the alcohol, but please don't be fooled by the number of ingredients listed on the menu, because I definitely did NOT taste anything but bitterness, water, and a hint of mint for my lychee mojito.  Our server rushed us and it was VERY obvious. She seemed extremely impatient for us to order, and when the food came she never came to check on us, only her colleagues did. We were seated at the bar and did not see anyone waiting for our seats and other couples at the bar area were NOT rushed like this in any way. The restaurant was not even full even though it was a Friday night so I saw no reason why she would be so rude. She did not give us water even though we mentioned it to her twice. When she came to take our empty plates away she immediately asked if we just wanted the bill.  Overall I did not feel welcomed despite the show that they put on to \"welcome\" us and \"say goodbye\". I will not be coming back to this Guu because of this hypocrisy. If you are going to scream and yell to welcome us and put on a show, please make sure your servers are trained properly, and treat your customers with respect when it comes to the actual service."}
{"text":"They scream too loud and too much........food is good.... but the scream really got my last nerve...my ears are numb...I think I got anxiety issue after dinner...."}
{"text":"Do not go here if you want to talk. The food was so, so. And I am a Japanese Canadian who has eaten many decades of Japanese and fusion food. This was the noisiest restaurant I've ever been to. You had to pause your conversation everytime the hostess or some other staff person yelled out, who knows what. Me and my much younger dining partner could hardly wait to leave. We went elsewhere for post-dinner-drinks. Will not be returning and will advise others of the physical discomfort of dining at Toronto's noisiest restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is so fun! I lived in Japan a number of years ago and this really brings me back! Menu is always changing...a little in the pricey side for the size of some dishes...others are a good value. Excellent ebi Mayo and okonomiyaki . Amazing service and cocktails. Definitely order a cocktail with Ramune. Too fun!"}
{"text":"The food here is SO GOOD. My favourite dish is the beef udon, surprisingly because I'm a seafood junkie. Everything I've tried here is fantastic except one time I got a pork skewer that was pretty flavourless, so maybe skip that one. I've been to both the Church and Bloor location. I prefer the atmosphere at the Bloor location more (even though the service was slow and it took 30 mins to get one of our dishes, but it was worth the wait when it came) but the food is the same.  Oh, and it's very loud so be prepared talk loudly or yell at your buds."}
{"text":"Food is good, but it is so noisy the waiters yelling sounds so stupid!!! I am glad I changed my table."}
{"text":"Great place! I used to go the Guu Izakaya's back in Vancouver and I love both of them over here. The food is always good, the atmosphere is always upbeat. It's a great place to stop in for a small bite of big flavour with a friend, to have a party at, or even to just go solo if you are brave enough. The place is always packed, and everyone seems to have a good time. Prices are reasonable though a bit high.  expect a lot of noise, so maybe not the best place to bring an infant. It's loud, Bright and fun. I'm not the biggest seafood fan, but love most of what they have here."}
{"text":"Great place to have good Japanese food. The hostess are very friendly and the food is delicious. Great stop to be in Toronto."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for lunch couple days ago.  I ordered Sabamiso( sweet miso flavoured cooked mackerel ) The taste is good. The service is also very nice.  But it's too expensive. I paid 17 dollars including Tip and Tax. Their main dish( fish) is big but the other side dishes are tiny. I could eat the same dish for 8dollars in Japan.  Also their rice is so hard and doesn't taste so good.   Considering the fact that I'm in Canada, it's okay lunch and price.  But you know I'm Japanese I can't satisfied with their lunch because of their price."}
{"text":"One of my fav restaurants! Go early or you'll have to wait especially if you have a large group (this location takes reservations now, so book one if you plan to go). The baked oysters are probably my favourite dish, seafood is always fresh, you really can't go wrong at Guu. The staff always has great energy. If you go on an empty stomach, the bill can add up but its so worth it.  For dessert lovers: they have an almond tofu tray 20$ (not on menu), you get a large portion for what you pay for, good for 4-6 people to share!"}
{"text":"Restaurant: Guu Izakaya Cuisine: Japanese Location: Downtown Address: 398 Church St Price Range: ~$10  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 5 Service: 4 Ambiance: 4 Overall: 4.5  Extra information:  *Japanese Drinking Bar (Izakaya) *Based in Vancouver, BC *Couple locations in Toronto *Specialize in small sharing dishes *Sells sake, beer and cocktail  I never thought I would do a posting on Guu in million years. Just because I've been to Guu so many times in past 5-6 years ever since they opened their original one in Vancouver, BC.  Guu was the place to be couple years ago, grabbing dinner with friends or sipping away on grapefruit cocktail that your date makes for you. Their food is overall very delicious, good in portion (for sharing) and inexpensive so I was excited to hear that they were here in Toronto as well.  Last time I was walking home on Church street and I saw the crazy lineup outside the restaurant on a Saturday night. Guu in Vancouver has at least 20 minute waiting time, but this just looked crazy! My friend and I were originally suppose to check out Yuzu, but it was raining so hard we decided to drop by Guu that was closer.   Ordered: Gyu Capaccio 5/5  *7 pieces of seared beef sashimi with ponzu, wasabi, mayo & garlic chips for $6.50 *I love beef sashimi and you can tell that it's fresh and good quality *Make sure to eat them with radish that's served in the middle as well as the garlic chips *I like how they are bit on the thick side cause it makes it chewy *I could probably eat 3 plates of this on my own  Ordered: Amaebi Sashimi 4/5  *5 pieces of sweet shrimp sashimi from BC for $6.80 *I like the amaebi sashimi part but usually I get this for the fried head *These shrimps are sweet and they just melt in your mouth *They are from BC so you know they were probably frozen once but it's still fresh *Finish the shrimps but save the head and ask them to deep fry it for you *Deep fried heads are like shrimp crackers *I eat everything except their eyes...cause it creeps me out  Ordered: KimChi Udon 3/5  *Udon noodles with spicy cod roe topped with kimchi for $7.80 *This was probably one of the most disappointing dishes of the night *I knew the way Guu makes their KimChi udon but I ordered it anyways *I prefer KimChi to be stir fried with the udon but they just put it on top *Cod roe makes the udon kind of creamy and it goes well with the sour KimChi *One of the carb dishes that will fill you up  Ordered: Kaki Fry 4/5  *6 pieces of deep fried oyster with 3 kinds of sauce for $6.80 *3 kinds of sauce for this was Tonkatsu, Pink Tartar and Lemon&Salt *I enjoyed the Lemon&Salt and Pink Tartar, not so much the Tonkatsu sauce *Oysters were deep fried and served with 3 different types of sauce *How can deep fried oysters be bad?  Ordered: Gin Dara 5/5  *Black Cod for $9.80 *Cod dishes are always on the pricier side, but the way they make it at Guu- you can't resist *They make it so that the Cod just melts in your mouth *It's buttery, soft and melts in your mouth....(drool) *This was actually a decent sized fish, little smaller than my hands *Good with cold/hot sake  Ordered: Enoki Hotate Bacon 4/5  *4 pieces of Pan fried bacon wrapped scallop and enoki mushroom for $6.00 *I always feel like it's such a waste ordering skewers cause they seem so expensive *This was decent in size but $6 might be a little too much *Scallop-Bacon wasn't very good but Enoki Mushroom-Bacon was delicious *Served with light soy sauce on bottom and mayo on top *Perfect dish to order if you are having beer  Ordered: Unagi Doria 4/5  *Rice with unagi baked with cheese on top for 9.30 *This is another filler dish you can order to fill you up *There are lots of small unagi pieces on top and they don't cheap out on cheese *Entire dish is really hot and the unagi sauce makes the rice really sweet  1/3 way through our meal, I was actually getting really bad headaches from all the shouting and yelling inside the restaurant. I know I've been through it before and I should be used to it but Toronto Guu people are so much more louder compared to Vancouver Guu people!!  I really wanted to take my time and enjoy my meal but it was getting to a point where I couldnt stand it anymore and I just wanted to eat as fast as possible and leave. I did enjoy all the food and the nice service from people that were working there, plus the energy was great...but I just don't want to hear it every 5 minute.  Summary: Guu is a great place to go if you've never experienced izakaya style restaurants. With great energy, food, service and drinks- it's the place to be if you are out with your friends for drinks. I wouldn't recommend it if you want to have quiet intimate dinner with your date cause you will need to shout with your mouth full and they still won't understand what you are saying. Other than that, I will always love Guu!!"}
{"text":"LOVED it. Well worth standing in line. Best unagi don I've had outside of Japan."}
{"text":"OMG. This was the LOUDEST restaurant I've ever been to. TERRIBLE experience. Constantly had waiters yelling over me. Everytime someone walks in they scream welcome and when someone leaves they scream goodbye in Japanese. I literally sat down for 2 minutes and all that noise was giving me migraines and made me feel so uneasy that I had to leave. Seriously, I think you can go deaf sitting there for an hour. TERRIBLE ambiance.  Not for everyone."}
{"text":"Delicious Japanese tapas in a fun (loud) atmosphere. Came with friends and got to try a lot of things, all of which were delicious. Couldn't list out anything we did not like. Highlights included the salmon collar (daily special) which apparently was not available the second time our friends came through, so moral of the story is to go with the staff recommendation of the day. We also really liked the hamachi and the scallop carpaccio. Karaage chicken was also perfect to balance out the greaselessness of everything else. Fortunately, we were able to secure a table outside on a reasonably weathered evening as the continual staff screaming to welcome and send-off guests became a bit much after 10 minutes..."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time. African dishes. I had a macaroni lentil dish. Nice and spicy. The stews were also very good ((I had a try of my friends). The service is slow but they are new so I expect it will probably improve. The people are also very nice. The best thing is that three restaurants have inhabited this undesirable stretch of queen street. Hopefully the area will change."}
{"text":"Extensive sake list - a bit above my head but welcome for the variety. Despite being rebranded, this place is a fun alternative to just heading out for pints at the bar. The food is in snackable portions, and it's busy and raucous, so come if you're feeling like a lively time."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and had a decent time. Once I had a seat at the bar and was fed free samples of Japanese beer and sake until I was fairly buzzed. Another time, I had terrible greasy food and awful carpaccio and swore I'd never go back.   Well, I went back again because it has such a huge reputation and the line-up was non-existent, and the food was waaaaaay better. I had the calmari, stewed pork, bibimbap, takoyaki and several kinds of sake. The service was forgetful but as always cheery like crazy. It got a bit too loud but that's what it's all about. Nice decor and has a hidden unmarked door by the crummy parking lot in front of a convenience store. The patio looks nice and private."}
{"text":"I guess I don't care for Japanese food.  I've had sushi before, that's the extent of my expertise.  I was thinking 3 stars, but my biggest gripe is we drove into T.O. early in order to hit this in time for lunch.  If you've noticed, all of the reviews say \"You MUST try the ___!\" and \"I ALWAYS order the ____!\"  The problem?  NEARLY NONE OF THESE ITEMS ARE AVAILABLE ON THE LUNCH MENU!!!  So we ended up ordering random dishes, which we didn't enjoy and quite frankly, it ruined our day.  We had Maguro Tataki (not something I'd ever order again), and Shoyu Ramen.  The ramen was flavourless, I'm used to soups with spice, like Thai and Chinese are.  Luckily we also ordered Karaage Teisyoku, can't go wrong with fried chicken.  Would I go back?  Maybe for dinner, just to try some of the \"must try\" things, and to determine if I have any interest in Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"The staff was very respectful and kind! :D I definitely recommend the karaage & the carbonara  udon noodles! The karaage was very juicy and soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. It was perfect! :) The carbonara udon was creamy and had a lot of bacon bits in it. You can slurp the noodles very easily! :)"}
{"text":"I can honestly say that this place is one of the most fantastically fun exotic dining experience I have had. I was wowed.   Toronto on a rainy Monday evening is not 'dead' per say but pretty slow. I had heard rants and raves about this place but never got the chance to check it out. So my fantastic man being that he is fantastic suggested this place out of random. And what a perfect suggestion. We took the umbrella and conquered the rain.   The main door looks so sketch and camouflaged by the dark colour. At first, we weren't sure if it was the right place. Then the man opens the mighty door and we hear a loud bellow. Upon entering the staff all shout out \"welcome\" and make sure to all yell out \"goodbye, come again\" when you leave. All in Japanese so you really get into the experience. This sets the feel for the type of crowd that attends here. quirky,random,Hipsters, trendsetters, cute asn girls decked out in Harajuku and the oddballs that were cool to venture out here.   The staff deflect such good energy that its hard not to join. Eventually even the costumers join the \"welcome\" & \"goodbye\". They make you feel like you belong, which is such an awesome feeling. I swear, they could've given me cow poo and i STILL would rate this place as my favourite restaurant so far.   For customer convenience they have a jacket rack right at the front so you wont have to crowd your already tiny table.    The place itself is really tiny. And considering it was a Monday evening, it was quite busy. I have a feeling this place never dies down. We get seated in this tiny table for 2 and even though the table can barely give room for 1 western style plate, I was excited to try the food.   The menu is hard to understand at first but it's basically a large list of snack like items. You order a bunch of things and share which is a good way of trying new dishes.   Edemame - warm and fresh. I especially liked that they don't drown it with salt.  Guu Carpaccio - Beef sashimi w ponzu and wasabi mayo- This was delicious. The beef was very thinly sliced so I needed more to really give you a good review. Although, that's just an excuse to have more because it was damn delicious. Not ideal for sharing.   ebi mayo - deep fried prawns with spicy mayo - The prawns are massive and very chewy which I rather enjoyed. I didn't like the spicy mayo as much as the garlic mayo.  IKAPIRI - deep fried calamari with spicy ketchup and wasabi mayo - This was VERY yummy! I really hated how small the portion was but if you are a fan of calamari, this place will rock your socks off. The batter was perfectly light so it didn't over power the taste and mixed well with the wasabi mayo.   SABA - grilled saba mackarel with dill,herb,garlic,lemon and onion - This was our fav dish. he fish was so light but it was almost too perfect. The piece is humiliatingly tiny so make sure to order a few of these. Almost everyone around had this on their order. Once you taste how succulent this fish was, it Will be very hard to think of eating fish anywhere else. I'm not even big on fish.  KAKIMAYO - bc backed oyster with mushroom,spinach,garlic mayo topped with melted cheddar cheese - Make sure you share this. Unless you can afford a few oily arteries. That is exactly what this dish is. It was my first time having oyster and it has a rather dry texture so all the much more liquid toppings create a sauce like for the oyster. The oil component is very high here so make sure to take it easy. The garlic mayo is melted so when it first comes to the table, the aroma is just orgasmic.   for desert - black sesame - really liked this. pretty much the same everywhere else but it's hard to find this ice cream so bonus points ( as if i have any more points to give to this place) and coconut ice cream that was creamy and just perfectly light enough to compliment the fantastic green tea cheese cake.  Again, portions are not fair here but It's hard to complain about anything when it's just good energy.   dinner # warm sake = $58.98  i will absolutely be coming back here.  xoxo M. (thank you Wayne C.)"}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of the BAKED OYSTER with cheese (the KAKIMAYO). I could eat ten of them! It is absolutely divine. I would also recommend the KINOKO BIBIMBAP, my other favourite item on the menu.   I love the fun atmosphere but it's not a place to go for a quiet dinner. Definitely a place I bring my friends from out of town."}
{"text":"I was hesitant on giving this place a four star rating because I was told this place was amazing but I thought the foodwas too salty.   The ambience was great with the decorations but it was rather small which makes the wait outside rather long. It was interesting since they yelled Japanese phrases all the time which was great at first but then it got repetitive and annoying.  Food was okay and over priced. I don't think I would be a regular here."}
{"text":"The patriarch of the izakaya craze in Toronto, Guu is always a fun experience at Church or Bloor and it hasn't gotten any worse as its aged. Great sake, creative and tasty tapas-style food, and a very sociable authentic Japanese bar ambiance makes for a great dining or drink experience. I would have given it four stars due to the legendary wait times (which were mostly outdoors), but since the growth of the izakaya scene, wait times have gotten a bit better and I believe both locations take reservations now (at least the Bloor location does for sure). Food is not cheap, but fairly priced and the same goes for their drinks."}
{"text":"Really great japanese tapas. Frantic and loud atmosphere but that is what adds to the excitement. Long wait to get in but again well worth it. A must try in Toronto"}
{"text":"Great Food Great atmosphere  i recently visited Guu for the 3rd time and yet again was not disappointed the food in the space is electric and very immersive . The food is just as exciting with a very diverse menu and all dishes are perfect for groups or couples   dont be afraid to try something new! you never know what your next favourite dish could be"}
{"text":"I went to Kinka on a Wednesday night for a quick bite and some sake. My friend and I ordered the bamboo sake, okonomiyaki, takoyaki and the matcha cheesecake. Everything was delicious and the food came fairly quickly. Not to mention, the sake was an incredible value for the amount we got.   Service, on the other hand, was lacking. I feel like our server prioritized bigger groups and ignored the two-person tables. We sat for about 15 minutes prior to even getting the water, which we requested right away.   I will definitely return, even if it's just for the sake."}
{"text":"Super cool spot. The staff greet you in Japanese and the tapas style dishes are very yummy. Pub style Japanese joint and very cool selection of drinks even served in bamboo cups. Make sure to come early since there is usually a line up. ;) There is also a second locations on Bloor, but I have personally never been."}
{"text":"4 stars - 4 star for food, 4 stars for ambience - my ears were ringing after this meal.  You walk in the windowless doors and are greeted by a loud and enthusiastic group of staff screaming in Japanese.  This continues throughout the entire meal until you leave.  I understand it's part of the whole izakaya dining style, but sometimes a girl just wants to eat her meal in peace and not have to scream to talk to the person beside her!  The meal was a fantastic array of various Japanese tapas-style dishes.  It did take a while for the food to start arriving and was a bit of a wait in-between dishes, but it was a busy Wednesday evening.  Highlights of the meal: - Beef carpaccio - this was so tender and well-marinated in a delicious tangy sauce that we ordered another one - Fried brie with mango sauce - ordered two of these too!  Would be good as a dessert as well.  Fried and crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside. - Beef tongue - very chewy, but good flavor - Seared tuna - not too memorable - Salmon tartare - too much avocado, not enough salmon, but still tasty - Salmon sashimi - fresh fish, light in flavor. - Macarel? I think? - super hot and fresh straight from the kitchen - flaky and well-seasoned - Agedashi tofu - I've had better agedashi tofu elsewhere, but this was acceptable and the amount they give you is quite generous - Takoyaki - very hot on the inside, so beware.  This was pretty authentic tasting. - Mushroom rice bowl thing (sorry, forgot what it was called!) - this was fragrant, hot, flavorful, and just overall delicious - great to have as a starchy/carby/filler dish.  There were a boatload of dishes to choose from and the above doesn't even cover all of them.  At $40/person for a ton of dishes though, we ate to our heart's content.  I suggest coming here in groups of 4 or 5 so you can try a bunch of things, and most dishes come with 4-5 pieces of food (or more).  Great place for a casual dinner with friends after work.  Definitely not a first date type of place."}
{"text":"The best restaurant experience I've ever had, as well as the best fried chicken I've ever had. GET A SAKE BOMB, you will love this place.   This place truly makes you feel amazing after leaving it, both with food, service, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"We had the most amazing time at your restaurant on Friday. Our evening was memorable. Special thanks to the staff for being so great!!"}
{"text":"It is not bad for me! I am a returned customers for six years. But my co-worker Craig has some complaints and he thought the service was awful."}
{"text":"Went to the location on Church.  Loved the atmosphere for going with a group of people.  Given it's an Asian restaurant I was saddened at the lack of veggie, non-dairy options. I just had to ask for foods without cheese."}
{"text":"It's a rare occasion to enter a restaurant that has so much energy and excitement! The employees here seem to love their job, and that is clearly evident by the great service and excellent food.  The dishes here cater towards all likes; from conservative eaters to the more adventurous, there is a dish for every body. I recommend sitting at the bar where you can watch the chefs make the food.  Just be warned that it can get very loud in here, so don't go expecting a nice quiet meal. But if you love food, this place is something you should definitely try."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch numerous times. Note that lunch has a very different menu mainly consisting for bentos, noodles, and rice bowls.  Service as with any Guu is excellent.  Food is quite good as well. I find that a lot of people don't like the small sides, which frequently consist of pickled vegetables, but it's a small portion of the lunch. Lunch selection is also very limited if you don't eat meat, be warned, but their mix fried is great. Ramen is about the same price and higher quality than some of the nearby ramen places."}
{"text":"Fun and lively atmosphere. Beef short ribs were tasty! Food generally was good. Debating if it was worth the long wait.   Still would recommend, prefer their Bloor location."}
{"text":"Great atomosphere, delicious food and amazing service. All around a great food experience. I'd love to tell you more but you should just try it out yourself. Now that there aren't 2 hour waits to get it, everyone should definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing atmosphere and delicious delicious food. Definitely on a pricey side a little bit, but 100% worth it. Great for sharing as well especially with a large group. They're usually very busy, so best to make reservations in advance!"}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with Guu. I have heard so many people rave about this place and finally got to try it for myself. From the unique and energetic atmosphere they create to the decor and seating, and of course the food, they have definitely brought Japan to the streets of Toronto. This restaurant provides a taste of Japan and is the best Japanese food I have had in Toronto by far.   Every single dish was spot on and delicious! The salmon belly sashimi and the green tea creme brulee were the most delicious dishes I have ever had and would definitely recommend! The waiters/waitresses were attentive and extremely friendly.   We got there at 5pm so there was no wait time but the place filled up quickly within 30 mins of being seated. The restaurant is really loud and noisy and has a 2 hour seating time.   I will definitely be back to try everything else on the menu!!"}
{"text":"To sum up my experience in one sentence: SO. FREAKING. AMAZING.   Positives-  Food: AMAZING. I actually don't eat sashimi even though I LOVE japanese food. But I have to tell you. This was the ONLY place I actually ATE it and enjoyed it!! Their takoyaki was delicious! Their Oysters were foodgasmic. Their tofu pudding WAS AMAZING.   Environment-  INCREDIBLY WELCOMING! Right when you enter they ALL scream \"Irashaimasen!\". You can tell that everyone working there is having fun while providing AMAZING SERVICE. During my stay at Guu, it was someones birthday. It was very surprising that they all took shots of alcohol with them! ^.^ GUU IS AN AMAZING AND FRIENDLY RESTAURANT. A PERFECT  PLACE TO GO WITH FRIENDS! ^.^  Waiting- I think this might have been one of the only negatives. We had to wait around 45min to get in but I mean what can you expect? The food is delicious, the environment is amazing, the workers are incredibly friendly. IT IS DEFINITELY WORTH THE WAIT.  Summary- YOU. MUST. GO. HERE."}
{"text":"This is totally the craziest Japanese restaurant in all Toronto! I've been going there for the past 5-6 years even before they changed their name from Guu Izakaya to Kinka Izakaya. I was worried when they changed the name because I thought the restaurant would change too, but that really isn't the case! They stayed the exact same and it's perfect like this.   The menu is really cool because you can order many small portions just like Japanese tapas! It's great and they have tons of different options.   Another good thing I like when we go there is the infamous bamboo saké!!! We always order many of those... So good!  It's best to go there with a group, but if you're only 2 it's okay too since they always keep you distracted by yelling in Japanese to greet and thank good bye every single costumer that walks in and out the place.  It's also really cool if you have a birthday to celebrate as all the staff will come dance and sing for you right at your table! We did that for my mom a couple of years ago and for my birthday last year too!  We also took the staff there last winter for our Christmas party and everybody had a blast and loved it so much!!! I am tempted to take them there again this year: I don't think they will complain of my lack of originality!  Also try the saké bomb and don't forget to sing with them and bang on the tables!   Do not go there if you want to be on a quiet romantic date, might not be ideal!"}
{"text":"Takoyaki and unagi doria are very good. this place is fun izakaya, to visit while in Toronto. The place is loud and have good crowd while I was there. Reservation is recommended otherwise you may have to wait to be seated. Ought to try while you are in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Super good food, super good drinks. Can be very loud though. Had the itame and hamachi, banana tempura and a couple yuzu collins'. The itame was off the hook, hamachi was fresh, both off of the specials menu. I love yuzu so i'm a bit partial to the drink, but it was balanced and refreshing. Banana tempura was good too. I like that the special menu tells you the source of their fish. Portion sizes were very appropriate."}
{"text":"Guu is like that super hot person that everyone wants to get with. It's easy to overlook some of their imperfections, because all you are thinking of is how unique and exciting the ride will be.  If you are not completely satisfied with your Guu experience and are unsure if you want to go back, Guu doesn't mind. There's an hour long queue of potential customers who will gladly take your place.  Guu doesn't have to go the extra mile for you, they just have to treat you good enough.  You'll keep coming back, you just can't help yourself, and they know it.  So yeah, it's not true love, but I'm a sucker for Japanese inspired decor, creative menus, and $9 mugs of Sapporo the size of my head.   This restaurant transported me back to Tokyo!(Except it's filled with Canadians, Ryerson students, and it's sub-zero Canadian winter when you open the door).  The atmosphere is fantastic! Rowdy and high energy!  The server was polite, informed us of the 2 hour seating time limit, and brought us hot and fragrant towels for our hands.  They sat us beside the door.  It was cold. They offered us blankets... so it was a cross between a Japanese bar experience and eating on a plane.  I enjoyed all the items we ordered. Oysters, octopus, kimchi bibimbap, Aburi Salmon, Karaage...  The only real disappointment was the Hotate Butter, which I feel Ematei does better.  Overall, I had a nice time. But Guu didn't make me feel special or appreciated. And I know to Guu it doesn't really matter. Guu, it's just so hot right now. Sigh."}
{"text":"Amazing and well worth the wait. Everything tastes good - I like ordering from their daily specials, especially amaebi (sp?) when they have it. Love the atmosphere - go with friends and share lots of dishes. And it's so cheap for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere, they really commit to the Izakaya experience. Order a sake bomb, the show they put on is hilarious and will have the entire bar stop to see what is going on. Food is very good too and reasonably priced. Takoyaki and Black Cod are two key dishes to make sure you order."}
{"text":"I went back today and splurged.  My favorites of the night were: ebi mayo (fried shrimp) and the salmon tataki - grilled shashimi (which is one of the best I have ever tasted).   The Japanese waiters are always sweet, efficient, attractive and exotic - both men and women.  It's always busy at Guu - so be patient.  We had about a half hour wait on Gay Pride weekend. And when we got our table they had already run out  of their lobster tempura which was their special.  But there was a lot of tasty choices on their regular menu. I was impressed that our food came out fast, despite being packed."}
{"text":"3.75 Stars. Not 3 but not a full 4. My family and I came in on a busy evening.  Since our party was large, we opted to sit in the heated outdoor area without a wait.  I definitely wouldn't want to sit out there again if I had a choice.  Considering our large party and no wait, beggars can't be choosers.  The seating was a bit cramped and the heating was only adequate torso up, leaving our legs very cold on a Toronto winter's night.    The food was overall very good. A korean-japanese fusion more than purely japanese cuisine. Everything was essentially tapas styled - small plates to share, perfect to complement drinking. HA! I came with a high schooler and middle schooler. Not the most family friendly place. Definitely would go back with friends, not family.  My favorite dish was the miso eggplant - not too salty and the eggplant was perfectly cooked.  I found the Salmon Natto Yukke very fresh and delicious as well.  With the family, the Kinoko bibimbap was a hit and the Unagi Doria was a miss.    The Unagi Doria lacked...UNAGI. hmm...   The service was overall great.  Slow to start. But our server was incredibly attentive and did his best to manage the tight space filled with lots of bodies.  Good to note: your tea cup will never be empty for too long. He did a great job making sure our tea cups were always full.    Overall, Kinka Izakaya was very good.  I am curious to see what it would be like to go back with friends.   Also good to note: the bathroom is awesome!  Individualized rooms with mouth wash and female supplies as well.  Little wins :)"}
{"text":"Busy place and a bar/pub lively atmosphere. Food's good, drinks are better and the service pleasant in such a chaotically hustling place!"}
{"text":"Many dishes were good such as the yakiudon, although I was not wowed by anything.  However, the restaurant was just too loud, with constant yelling and bustling to make for a pleasant eating experience.  The food did not make up for the dining experience."}
{"text":"If you're having a slow and meager day, this place will liven you up as you walk through the day.   After a short wait for a table, the staff was ready to help us although the crowd was unbelievable.    It was amazing service through the evening with food coming from all directions.    It's a loud place so if you want to have a large group discussion this maybe not the place but otherwise a fun place to yell.    We had appetizers, pancakes, seafood, unagi and lots more.   The food made us  crave for much more as we kept ordering more and more.   The only downside of most of the dishes is the saltiness.      Definitely someplace i'd try again and will come back to often."}
{"text":"Might be my favorite restaurant to casually go to. If we ever cant decide on a restaurant for dinner, Kinka is a safe bet. It always provides a great meal for a fair price in a fantastically fun environment.  As soon as you enter the restaurant, you will be greeted (loudly) by the fun, upbeat staff. The kitchen is open-concept and you will be able to see every dish being made.  Overall, I highly recommend getting the takoyaki, the salmon aburi, and the tuna tataki.  The mushroom bibimbap is also very good, and the baked oysters are delicious.  The dishes are priced on the higher side of a casual meal, and it will cost about $35-$50/person.  Try not be startled if the staff yells at you (again) as you're leaving."}
{"text":"!F@@@ ME!~ That would be the only way to describe how truly great this place is. It really reminds me of a stripped down small bar Munich Oktoberfest. The staff are truly amazing, fun, and god can they cook.  All the times I had to drive from Detroit to Toronto via Sarnia. All the times I've been on the Via Rail for 5 hours The year I spent working in Mississauga. All the times I've had to sit through the border security line between Michigan and Canada.  All these things are forgiven!!!  This place is that good!  The food was damn good but to be honest they could have served dog food with the atmosphere they have and I'd still have loved it.  However The deep fried hard boiled egg stuffed pumpkin The deep fried Oysters The deep fried Tofu The grilled Pork cheek The raw beef  were gone as they hit the table. The flavors were all there.  BTW-Real Wasabi. The dishes were timed well and I just wanted more.  The prices are great and the local who have passed by here (The staff at Starbucks I told about it). Get our a@@es there and have some fun."}
{"text":"Must Try: Gyu Carpaccio (Beef Sashimi), Takowasbi (Octopus), Salmon Natto Yukke (Salmon and Seven Friends) Kabocha Korokke (Pumpkin Croquette), Brie Cheese, Kakimayo (Baked Oyster), Yakiudon (Creamy Udon), Kinko Bibimbap   Rating: (10/10) Food, (9/10) Service, (9/10) Value, (9/10) Ambience, (9/10) Presentation, (9/10) Cleanliness  My Experience:    Been coming here for years, a favourite spot to hit up when esp to take friends visiting from out of town. First and foremost, the environment is LOUD. Not a quite calm Japanese restaurant you may be used to, but a loud place with servers yelling greeting and salutations. Next, this is not a typical Japanese restaurant, not a place to get sashmi and rolls, but other more unique dishes. The menu is a bit much to take in, but everything is a 10 here.   Every time you walk in you are greeting by a warm high-energy hello from all the staff. They have a great selection of food and drinks, I suggest the Big Mug Beer for the ambitious and brave.   The dishes are Tapas sharing style, and are not extremely large, most single orders will feed 2 - 3 people comfortably, 4 would be pushing it a bit. The best part is that you can order a lot of different options to try their extensive menu.   Overall, one of the best spots in Toronto to grab some food, the place is great for larger parties of friends, whether just for a meal or to celebrate a special occasion!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The best atmosphere, cold beer and burning miso soup oh yea delicious.  Highly suggested.!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! If I ever have international guests I will always take them here. It's so much fun and the food is amazing! I love the natto, chicken udon, and any sashimi. Make sure to get a round of sake bombs, they're always fun."}
{"text":"One of the best, most fun, and delicious meals I've had in a long time! There's 3 Guu locations around Toronto, and I believe this is the first one opened. You are greeted warmly with cheers from everyone in the dining area (including chefs) the moment you enter. The restaurant does tend to get pretty noisy in there though, so it's not the best place for an extended conversation. However, definitely go here for the delicious food. We had the hot pot soup, grilled cod, tako wasabi, beef carpaccio, and this hard boiled egg in a pumpkin mix/sauce all of which were amazing. Each dish has such strong flavors that go really well with each other. I can imagine that everything on the menu is just as delicious. I can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere if you don't mind noise, and like trying something new. Their food is also really great but this is definitly not a first date kind of place."}
{"text":"I loved the friendly atmosphere at the restaurant. I was not expecting such a great welcoming. I was surprised but it was kinda funny.  We ordered four meals and the most of it was really good! I particularly liked the okonomiyaki (Japanese omelet).  Very nice place but a little bit loud! The \"screamings\" don't bother me but the loud music did"}
{"text":"Guu is Guu'd!  I'm a total fangirl of Kinka Family chains, and I love this Guu - second only to the original Vancouver downtown location, if only for nostalgia's sake.   Yes, the communal bench tables are crowded with very little personal space separating you & the stranger next to you, and the super amped up, blaring Japanese background music and shouts of orders somehow miraculously decibals above it are LOUD.  But that's the point - it feels, and is, a friendly and energetic bar/tapas joint encouraging sharing of foods, drinks, and general raucousness.   If you've been to Shibuya 109 back it it's heyday, the volume level is reminiscent of the weekend gyaru shouting into their megaphones, with equal measure of enthusiasm.   Lots of mixed drinks here, mostly featuring a mixture of soju or sake.   The food - the best part! I'm here for lunch right now for a lunch menu that averages at about $13 per set, with the exception of the sashimi lunch which will set you back at $16.  Usually though, I'm here for dinner.  The highlights for me are: - Any of the carpaccio, which is usually torched slices of sashimi served with crispy fried garlic bits - Fried Brie cheese with a drizzled mango sauce - Chicken karaage  - Tontoro/pork cheek  I have so many more recommended dishes, but my lunch has just arrived...nomnomnomnom!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite izakaya in Toronto. The food and service are always excellent. The room is fun (you may end up making new friends) and boisterous. If you're not sure what to order, there's even a new tasting menu (and at $25 per person you really can't go wrong)."}
{"text":"Went there last night without reservations and I think the crappy weather made people stay away as we did not have to wait in line! I was shocked. But, we couldn't sit at a table, we had to take the bar stools where they cook the food.  Let me be clear - make reservations. They are very happy, friendly, and excited, but it's very hard to have a conversation when they scream hello/goodbye to everyone coming in and out. That was my only problem with the experience as a whole though!  The Good: 1. Food. The food is delicious and interesting. The portion sizes are surprisingly good value. Not like tapas. 2. Service. Extremely friendly, very attentive, will wait to notice you are done with the menu. 3. Atmosphere. They are so happy here - so it's a great Japanese experience.  The Bad: 1. Lines. They (usually always) have a line to get in. Make resos! 2. Loud. It's a very loud resto so it's hard to have a conversation.  Had 4 dishes, and loved all 4. Beef tongue steak, honey glazed pork, deep fried prawns, and bibimbap! Favourite was the pork, follow by (in order) deep friend prawns, beef tongue, and bibimbap.  Sapporo beer is only 5.99 for 16oz which is decent.  Definitely check this one out."}
{"text":"Going to Guu was a fantastic experience. It's a very nice restaurant, in a good location.  If you like Japanese food, as far as I know, this is the place to go in Toronto. The food is good, and the staff is very nice. It's a bit noisy as they are \"yelling\" all the time (they do this in many Japanese restaurants, I don't why exactly, but I liked it). To maximize your experience, go there with at least someone else, so you'll be able to share plates together.  The price is good, the food is fresh, and tasty, the service is very nice, and all the employees welcome you when you enter the restaurant. Very nice place to go! It will probably be a 5 stars if I have the same experience next time I'm going there."}
{"text":"Guu Izakaya was an interesting experience to say the least.  The staff are incredibly friendly and attentive... made my friend and I feel very welcome and enthused... heh, he even chimed in with a few 'Heyyyys!' himself along with the staff ; D  The food... tasty, but pricey for the small quantity.  Although we knew before coming that this is a tapas place and did order a significant amount of food, I was still a bit hungry after leaving... then again, that could just be me and my huge appetite.    We ordered the baked oysters, the mushroom and cheese bibimbop, the grilled mackerel and the yaki udon.  All the dishes were good, but I especially liked the baked oysters and the yaki udon.  The baked mmm oysters.. I definately could have eaten another 20 of these.  The yaki udon was such a simple yet flavorful dish.  I've never had udon noodles that had a mild smokiness to them.   All in all a very pleasant dining experience... next time I'm going to try their birthday shot and their interesting looking desserts which I noticed on other peoples plates."}
{"text":"The grilled oyster was delicious. I'm gonna try and recreate it."}
{"text":"As long as you're up for a loud night, Guu is pretty awesome! As soon as you enter  you are greeted by all the restaurant staff in Japaness (and as you leave) and you almost feel like you're entering their surreal movie like experience. The menu is very creative and 95% of all the dishes I've tried (and i feel like I've tried all the vegetarian options!) are delicious. I love their mushroom-cheese bibimbap and their eggplant dish."}
{"text":"Great food, good atmosphere but a little noisy for my liking (although I think that's the point). Small patio at the side of the restaurant which is nice in the Summer.  Food is really good but a bit on the expensive side and the portions aren't huge. They have a large seating area near the kitchen so you can see the kitchen staff prepare your food.  Worth a visit but don't expect to hear much of your friend's conversation!"}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere is superb and the service is more than attentive.  It's a small space, and given the staff/patron ratio, it's damn crowded, even when it opens on a Wednesday in the middle of a snow storm.  The whole staff yell out a happy welcome (I'm assuming) whenever anyone walks in, out, orders something, or turns their head.  It makes for a very lively and fun atmosphere.  Food is served *FAST* so be ready for the onslaught.  We ordered a selection of dishes, everything from bimbimbap (Korean fried rice) to salmon sashimi (sort of).  There is certainly an abundance of flavour in everything served -- to a degree that makes it stand out among other similar fare.  It's like if you took every meal you usually encounter, and somehow managed to compress twice the flavour into the same volume.  Strangely, drinks are a little on the weak side, though the marble pop you get with them certainly goes a long way to addressing the shortcoming.  One small complaint, though we didn't point it out to the waitress -- we ordered beef tongue, and got (amazing) short ribs instead.  I'm assuming this means they were out, and the gesture was nice, but it would have been nicer to pick our own substitute."}
{"text":"What a fun place! Uniquely decorated and great food! We orders six dishes for the 2 of us and we were stuffed!  We had: shrimp mayo, pork belly, tuna sashimi, grilled hokke, kimchi udon, and grilled oyster- all were delicious.  One star taken off bc of the noise level- love the high level energy of the staff- they greet everyone walking in in unison- and very loudly. They also shout out orders as they receive them and as dishes come out (I think). But after a while it does get a little annoying hearing shoutings in my ear every ten seconds.. I feel bad for the staff- I can only imagine what their throats feel like at the end of the night- and also wonder if some spit doesn't make their way into the food as they shout at the top of their lungs... Still , it's with a try at least once."}
{"text":"To me this place looks like a Japanese Izakaya got mixed up with Western pub culture. Their delicate dishes and sincere service are like what you may expect to have in Japan, while it is as loud as a typical pub.  And they do have Japanese people as their staff."}
{"text":"My boyfriend really wanted to go here so I said sure why not. I had no idea what to expect when I came here. First of all, the entrance looks really sketchy. All it really is is a gigantic curtain covering a huge door. Once you step in, it's pretty dark. Minimal lights and decent seating. The menu is small and limited. My boyfriend really wanted to come here for the karage don and takoyaki. I ordered a shoyu ramen.   My boyfriends meal came out first before mine and the smell was delightful. It looked really good. When mine came out, it smelled good but the taste on the other hand... was what killed it for me.   The broth is VERY salty. It was so salty I almost couldn't finish it. The pork pieces were way too big in size for me. The noodles were my only favourite part tbh. I was drooling over my bf's food. I took a bite of his and it tasted just like McDonalds chicken but a thousand times better.   I also had a lychee drink. That was good too.   Overall, I think I'd only come back here for anything else besides the ramen. Not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"I love Guu. Who doesn't? The only disappointing dish I've ever had is the beef tongue. Everything is is consistent and on point."}
{"text":"I was taken here for a first date, and it was the best decision ever. The loud ambience drowns out any awkward silences.   Food is delish and arrives super quickly."}
{"text":"There's no more I can say about their food-- generally FANTASTIC !! I can't think of any dish that would let you down.   It's too loud for me though. Services are sooo good."}
{"text":"I'm all about variety, so I love the concept of Guu - lots of small tapas-style dishes on their menu.  Luckily it was nice out and the hour-long wait outdoors was actually enjoyable.  When it was our turn to be seated, we walked into a roomful of shouting servers and chefs.  I'm not sure what they said to us, but I'm sure it was welcoming.  My friend had been here a few times before and took care of the ordering for us.  I think she ordered everything on the menu (or close to it) and I loved it all.  There was weird stuff that I was skeptical about, but those dishes turned out to be my favourites!  I highly recommend the octopus balls, the pumpkin croquette, the brie cheese and calamari.  I was also very impressed with their cocktail options.  There's lots of interesting drinks to choose from including Japanese beers and wines and some non-alcoholic beverages.  In this department I recommend their lychee cocktail.    The meal was a little pricey due to our extravagant ordering.  We couldn't even finish everything we had ordered!  I think next time I would order a little to start and add on if required.  Great service.  The polite servers always excused themselves while coming to our table and asked politely before removing any plates.  They also taught us how to store our purses in the mini compartment under our seats.  Of course, on our way out they shouted something at us in Japanese.  I hope it was something nice, but my Japanese is very rusty so I can't be sure."}
{"text":"I was debating to give 4 stars for the service or 3 stars for the fact that my friends and I were waited for 2 and half hours in a cold night and still wasn't seated.   We went there around 5:30pm and made a reservation, but there were 11 groups in front of us. Maybe we were out of luck, it happened to be EVERYBODY'S Birthday. They sang the hbd song like ever 5 mins.  5 mins passed 9pm, I checked with the girl and she said there're still 2 groups before us but we didn't see the groups coming in! This was the reason I was so mad! We left few mins after for cheap fresh hot food with an almond tofu take out."}
{"text":"almost everything here tastes amazing, and its convenient because of the multiple locations.  Always wait for the lovely frozen grape treat, its delightful! Only downfall its too loud to hear the person next to you."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing atmosphere. When you order sake bomb staff comes out cheers for you. Super fun, worth the money obviously!"}
{"text":"Great food with a good ambiance! Takoyaki, beef sashimi, takowasabi, and oden taste Great Kimchi udon and edamame is ok Bamboo sake is put in real bamboo tube but the sake is just average Good place for a relaxing evening tho the music is a little bit too loud:P"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for dinner on a Friday night. We were told it will be about 45 mins. Ok.  We put our name on the wait list.  About 5 mins later, the host came and asked if we would like to seat on the counter. Sure why not?  It is LOUD and very entertaining inside!  Definitely not a place to have a romantic date or business dinner!  You will not be able to hear your other party.  Drinks was ok.  I had better.  Food was decent but not that blow-my-mind fantastic.   Dishes are tapas style so order a few to share."}
{"text":"If ACME restaurant in New Orleans had the best chargrilled oyster, then Kinka Izakaya in Toronto had the best baked oyster. It was so delicious that I could eat those over and over again. The service was great here. Every thing we ordered were delicious."}
{"text":"I really missed some service here.   Guu is a noisy place, something I was aware of beforehand so I was glad when we were seated at the patio. This however had an impact of service, my water was never once refilled and the servers didn't really have an opinion on dishes when I asked them. One of the lady servers was good but then we interacted with two others after and they were always in a rush.   The food was good but nothing great. I did not like the hot pot at all nor did I like the tofu seaweed salad. I liked the cold salmon dish with garlic and the baked oyster was good (but really heavy). Also, I ordered for a grilled fish which was supposed to come on a sizzle plate but mine came minus the sizzle, and the fish was a bit rubbery (like when you cook it and don't serve right away). However, I did enjoy the Guu Virgin Mojito.   I don't think it's my kind of place, I prefer a sushi spot over this but i did see a lot of other people enjoying themselves.   Definitely worth one visit for the experience of an Izakaya."}
{"text":"3 stars only because it was at lunchtime with a limited menu (dinner is definitely the way to go and easily 4 stars).  There was nothing wrong with the service or food, but everything seemed a little more subdued and for the price point there are better lunch options in the area imo.  In addition to a pitcher of Sapporo, we ordered the kaarage chicken (highly recommended), onkonomiyaki, salmon and tuna tataki."}
{"text":"Love the lively ambiance, service is great, and loved almost all the dishes we ordered. Only negative is that it can cost an arm and a leg so I don't recommend coming hungry!   I came with a party of 4 total. We were hungry and ate a lot lol. 1 large mug of Sapporo each and our bill was $280 after tip ($70 pp if you don't want to do the math!)  Everything comes piping hot. I'm just gonna go through the good and the bad from what I can remember...  THE GOOD: Lobster sashimi - large portion for $14 and it was so fresh and sweet and delicious! Wow! Sadly the uni had a bit of a funk, but it does happen and I won't fault them on this review for it.  Kimchi udon and beef udon - so flavourful and saucy!  Beef tartare - super flavourful. Love the fried garlic chips with it!  Black cod - was a huge piece! So tender and delicate and beautifully seasoned  Marinated jelly fish - the bombbbbbbbbb dot com! Best jelly fish I ever had.  Hokkaido carpaccio - sooo good! Fresh sweet scallop sashimi in with a slightly creamy dressing  Deep fried chicken knee - if you like crunchy cartilage this is the dish for you! *crunch crunch, munch munch* Baked oysters - big and delicious!  Ebimayo - big crispy deep fried shrimp. Can't go wrong!   That's probably only half of what we ordered, but they're my stand out choices (though everything else was good too).   HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - ALSO make sure to make reservations! Don't line up like a loser, they probably won't even be able to find a spot for you!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, fun food. Expensive tho. Great place to go out with a large group, so you could try more dishes XD"}
{"text":"I like this place- its a lot of fun....order the Sake Bombs - servers come to the table, yells at you and then you bang on the table until the shot falls into the glass. Its loud, but the food is good and it's a fun date spot. Good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my sister! Unfortunately, there is less variety at lunch than at dinner, and the portions tend to be quite overpriced. All lunch sets are at a minimum $10.  I ordered the salmon don, which came with three pieces of flame torched salmon, and chopped pieces of salmon marinated with soy sauce. All this sat on a bed of marinated kelp, on top of the white rice. The marinade was very good but slightly salty, and soaked right through to the rice. The salmon was very tasty, but quite stringy and chewy (definitely consisted of the rougher cuts of meat). The seared salmon had a very rich and delicious smokey flavour. As this was a set, it came with miso soup and salad (which was topped with crunchy fried daikon chips).  My sister got the karaage don, which came with roughly five pieces of small karaage and a bit of lettuce. It was okay, but definitely not their best that I've had. The batter was slightly thicker than what I remember.  Overall, the food was good, but not amazing. Next time, I might just come for dinner instead."}
{"text":"Tapas style resto that's great for indecisive & gluttonous eaters like me.  Feature menu also changes weekly. Always something new and fresh to look forward to.   Atmosphere is always live & friendly. Wait can be a pain (looking to at least an hr+ wait) if you go right around opening at 5 pm till about 9ish. After that, wait cuts down to more than half. Instead of waiting outside in the cold though, I suggest giving them your number. For parties of 4 or more, they'll call you back when your table is 15 min. from ready. In that time you can go to Eaton's Centre or walk about.   If you're up for waiting, ask to go to the porch area. They have the \"cigarette smoking\" heaters in a little enclosed area outside. Also offer hot sake & drinks while you wait."}
{"text":"Not really impressed with this place. The food was good but not spectacular. Nice greeting when you come in! Black cod was very good. Very big oysters. Tuna tartare was good. Uni and steak tartare not available. Not much sashimi. Octopus fritters not very tasty. Ambiance typical for Japanese restaurants. Got a plum sake that was on the sweeter side but still good!"}
{"text":"Ambience: 5/5 Food: 4-4.5/5  Service: 5/5 Value: 4/5  Repeat: Many times. One of my favorites in the city."}
{"text":"I love this please really! Good vibes, lot of nice people and great food. It is great to go with a bunch of friends the atmosphere is hectic, but also which your partner can be fun. Usually when you get in everybody starts screaming something -hopefully- nice in Japanese and they hit some drums so you are certainly welcome here. I think it's best to make reservations before coming as it could be hard sometimes to find a spot if you are in a group of 4 people or more. To be honest I really don't have much patience and focus to read menus, so I usually just order a bunch of things like 2 or 3 randomly and... Hope for the best! I have to say, I was lucky enough to like everything I got. If you are thinking of coming here to get sushi is not really the place for it, they have lots of Japanese specialties that you can try and also the stuff that my other 2 friend got was nice, we taste a bit from each of us and it was good. Also the Asahi beer or Sake are recommended for the food they serve. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Always a good time at Guu. Lively atmosphere. Lots of energy. Best for groups of people. Make sure you make a reservation. Otherwise, expect to wait in line for up to a couple of hours. Here's what I can remember ordering on my last visit (Had too much sake. haha):  Hamachi  - Crazy good. We ordered so many of these and I could have had more!   Beef tongue - SO good. Lots of flavour. I could see this being a great dish to have with beer.   Pork cheeks - SO good. The sauce it comes with is fantastic   Fried chicken - Good but not great. Not the most flavourful but they have a good crunch to them. Served with mayo for dipping  Beef short ribs - Good but overcooked. I've had much better.   Deep fried prawn w/ spicy mayo - A little too rich. Barely tasted the prawn because of it.   Yakiudon - REALLY good yakiudon. The sauce was fantastic. I almost wish I had something to dip in it afterwards.   Sashimi salad - Refreshing but had a little too much dressing in it. I would have preferred it to be a little more naked - but I generally feel this way about seafood.   Kaki mayo  - Cheesy, creamy goodness but too creamy for me. Could barely taste the oyster part.   Almond tofu - Very good. Super silky and delicate. A perfect way to end the meal on a sweet note."}
{"text":"It was so nice here ! The atmosphere is really nice! However just a bit overpriced for the food portion that they give you. Lots of options though!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. The staff are very friendly. Food is reasonably priced. Also convenient location."}
{"text":"place was recommended to me by a local. and i'm SO glad. seriously THE best, coolest, liveliest, tastiest japanese place i've been to outside of Japan! OMG i can't stop raving to friends how amzazing this place is. its hard to describe.. you must just go and try! its definitely an experience! the waiters are all japanese and super cute and sweet. they all yell at each other when people enter and leave. you share long table with other parties. they have endless selection of tapa plates and sake and beer! if i was here longer, i definitely would have came again! best way to order is to look at other ppl's plates and see if it seems appealing to you, ask the waiter for suggestions, or read the descriptions. if you're a risk taker, you can't go wrong with any dish. loved it all!   we ordered:  hotate carpaccio takoyaki gin dara yaki udon kinoko cheese bibimbap kaki mayo guy tangue  cheese cake  sapporo pitcher hot and cold large sake"}
{"text":"Un voyage au Japon pour seulement 30-50$!!  C'est plein de vie, bruyant et délicieux. Lors de mon dernier voyage à TO sur les 17 jours....11 fois ..... quand j'aime, j'aime !! Je recommande cette endroit à chaque personne qui ose me dire qu'il se rend à Toronto. Imaginez un moment que vous êtes japonais. Après une dure journée au bureau vous prenez une ou deux bières avec un petit quelque chose à mangé dans un endroit comme le Guu.... Ça bouge, ça cris, ça vous insuffle une nouvelle vie...  De retour à la maison je vous jure que même fatigué ça \"Rock in the Casbah \"!!   Qu'est ce que j'y consomme. Moi j'ai tout essayé et j'aime tous. Mais plus particulièrement : les huîtres grillé au four, l'ensemble des fritures et des tonnes de cocktails.  La seul chose qui manque c'est d'être servi par Ai Otsuka comme dans le drama \"Tokyo Freinds\"... mais bon on peu pas tout avoir dans la vie.  Quelques petites astuces:  Dès votre arrivé mentionnez le à l'hôtesse. Quelques fois il y a des places au bar et si ça vous conviens, lui mentionner peu vous éviterez une attente d'environ une heure. L'été si vous voulez être assis sur la terrasse arrivé très tôt, se sont les place les plus convoitées."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE the energy here. The mushroom bibimbap is to DIE for! The staff are super friendly, the atmosphere is lively and the food is, of course, top notch. Try the sake sampler, spend your birthday here (they know how to make it fun) or just for a bite after work. You can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Been coming here since they first opened and was called Guu. I really like the loud welcoming atmosphere and the way they communicate with each other.  The food is always consistently good. I really like their tataki and deep fried brie. They also have a large selection of sake - we usually get the large bamboo between a few of us and some beers on the side.  I don't come often but I will definitely come back to see what changes has been made since they've become Kinka."}
{"text":"So much hype, a bit disappointed with service and food.  Service - halfway through my meal, we realized waitress never gave us the menu of the day.   Also, she forgot to bring us our sake until after our food had arrived.  Karaage - well worth the calories!  Crispy skin and just enough fat (but not too much) under it.  Perfectly fried and not greasy.  Gyu carpaccio - it was unexpectedly chewy with too much soy sauce  Sashimi salad - it's the korean sashimi salad with lots of lettuce and too much dressing.  sashimi slices were really thin  Grilled pork cheek - tasty, once again, too much soy dressing  Gomae - I like the black sesame paste, they could have put a little less  Cocktails - all served with gimmicky bottle of carbonated soda.  Not enough alcohol in it."}
{"text":"Former GUU. Japanese Izakaya. If you are tired of sushi, which I can't, or try another type of happy hour with great snack food. Here's the best. I love their kakimayo, oven cooked oyster with mayo on top. The Japanese draft beer is very refreshing. My husband love the beef tongue a lot and the loud environment. Ebi Mayo is very Goood !!!"}
{"text":"I love the staff here - so friendly! Perfect for birthdays and they make a big show of singing to you. Every dish we've tried is super tasty, and the atmosphere is beautiful- perfect balance between hip and cozy."}
{"text":"I ordered the gomaee as an appetizer ($4.50) and there was a hair in it.. I didn't make a fuss in the restaurant but it was nasty   I've been here plenty of times and their food never disappoints. The price range is good too. I can't get over the hair in my food today it was a big turn off"}
{"text":"Came to GUU for my birthday - I was pleasantly surprised to enter into a room with such HIGH energy totally party atmosphere. Every member of the staff stops to greet you (very loudly). Fun place to go with a group of friends.   Ordered the Lobster Tempura to start and and the Buta Kimchi Bibimbap to follow! Everything was beyond delicious! Will definitely be back here again! Awesome experience!!!"}
{"text":"Guu! Probably not for the faint of heart at this time of year, seeing as the temperature is in the deep negatives. However, despite being rather expensive, I'm a fan of this place.  Let's review. I went with one person, and we were originally going to order six dishes between the two of us, followed with one dessert. We had the duck, scallop carpaccio, jumbo shrimp with wasabi mayo, seared salmon sashimi, beef ribs, and fresh bigeye tuna from Japan. All of these were very tasty portions -- I particularly enjoyed the duck, thinly sliced, ever so slightly pink in the center, accompanied with a Japanese red wine sauce.   Admittedly, I am something of a big eater. However, after ordering six dishes, and sharing with only one other person, I would expect to at least be a little full -- sadly, we had to order an additional unagi don in order to fill up, before we ordered our pumpkin cheese cake dessert. Now while both of these tasted good too, at the end of our meal, we ran up a tab of $90. Now this was only food, no drinks other than tea and water.  Despite the slightly high prices for relatively small portions of food, going to Guu at least once would be worth it for the experience alone. The good food is a nice bonus, too!  For a more in depth review, feel free to visit my food blog, located conveniently in my profile!  Cheers. :)"}
{"text":"Portions are way too small. Every dish is very overpriced considering how little food you get, especially seafood dishes. The lobster ceviche was mostly tomatoes and chips, with maybe a dust of lobster. The hotate carpaccio is literally one scallop cut up into tiny pieces. Spent $50 and felt like I haven't eaten a thing."}
{"text":"Brilliant place. Food is priced very fairly and is quite amazing. I haven't had food like this in a while. The sake they have is also very good. Its best to go in a big group and share the tapas style dishes.   The atmosphere is unlike any other place you would go to. Very much like a traditional izakaya, the staff will welcome you with a big cheer and cheer your departure equally as well. Expect a loud enviornment.  However, there is a line up and a long waiting time during peak times. These are usually during dinner, especially on Fridays."}
{"text":"Guu you guys were amazing thank you for such a great time.  Came here with a few friends, line up was a bit long but worth the wait. As you come in you are greeted by completely the entire staff including the cooks! How do they even keep up with so much energy must be a great environment to work in.  What draws me back here every time is their menu is never always the same old items as they change many times during the seasons.   We had an amazing waitress that carefully explained their specials and her recommendations.  I must say I was skeptical at first to try the lobster sashimi but wow never have I tasted something so wonderful!!  Must try you will not regret!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good Japanese food, not your regular sushi shop. Very authentic, loud but very tasty."}
{"text":"Good is good. Great assortment for menu. The service takes away from the overall experience"}
{"text":"Me and boyfriend had one of the sampler menus and some saki, all of which was incredible. This restaurant was really loud though (its part of the atmosphere really) but wouldnt recommend it if you actually wanted to talk lol."}
{"text":"Best experience in a long time...  The food was amazing Servers was attentive and friendly Price... A steal Location is bit hidden... I walked by here for a year and never noticed it Decor- communal tables, so much going on, its hard to take in the decor Best part? The people... Everyone that works there are friendly and energetic and it was great even though loud but great!   1. Fried brie with mango and raspberry sauce- DELICIOUS ... I actually wanted to go again tonight to just get this 2. Soy sauce fried chicken- it was okay... It was served with mayo. It wasn't bad... It wasn't as good as everything 3. Baked oysters- cheese, spinach and mushrooms... So good! It was huge! *drools* 4. Oysterballs - this was good, I didn't really like it but only because I don't know what the creamy sauce is in the middle but the consistency made me not like it. It wasn't bad, just wasn't for me. Don't knock it til you try it ;)  5.BBQ water eel with cheese and rice- omg if I wasn't so full I'd love it more than I already do. The rice was crispy with pieces of eel. It was cheese and salty and its topped with seaweed.   6. Two sake shots 7. Sake mojito- I especially like the fun Cream soda it came with!  =$60 (this includes tax and tip)... Whaaaat?!?! Yes its that inexpensive for so much food and such a great experience! I'd highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place surprised me. Best udon I've ever had, hands down. The atmosphere is great and the servers are wonderful. Great for an authentic Japanese experience."}
{"text":"I go here as a sort of tradition where I treat myself after each exam season is over. Pricey but worth it. My only negative experience was when I sat in front of the chefs cooking (the long tables with the high chairs). The view of them cooking food was great but half way through my meal I started to really feel the heat coming from the fryers and stoves. I don't know if it was just an off day for me but I felt very light headed and stuffy. I desperately needed some cool, fresh air.   But don't let this one experience I had keep you from coming here. What I learned from this experience is to just sit at the tables a bit away from the cooks. I got to take the leftover food I had home since I was too light-headed to carry on nom-ing.  Highly recommend the following dishes: - karaage  - takoyaki  - brie cheese (seriously try this, it's so good)  - ikapiri  - Kakimayo (very cheesey) - kinoko bibimbap (I MUST HAVE THIS EVERY TIME I GO IN. When they bring it to you sizzling, leave it for a few minutes to let the rice and cheese to get crispy... and there's lots of mushrooms which I love)  Note: The \"big mugs\" are HUGE! Share-worthy if you're not a big beer drinker."}
{"text":"I went to Guu last week for dinner with my boyfriend since I had to see what all the hype was about considering I see line ups for it everyday when I come home from work. Now considering I am Japanese,  my impression is a probably a bit less excited since much of the food served is very common (karaage for example is something i've had for years).   We ordered: Shabu Salad, Takoyaki, salmon natto yukke, karaage chicken, ikapiri and the kinoko bibimbap. Drinks we had sapporo and the baby lulu  Food: Overall I thought it was good but I wasn't blown out of the water by anything in particular. The highlights were the kinoko bibimbap and the salmon natto (though this would make more sense served with rice). I do wish they had some more traditional Japanese items like pickled side dishes (no tsukemono??), street snacks (dango!) and desserts (mochi, purin).   Atmosphere: We sat on the patio since we wanted to talk and inside is just much to noisy for that. I'm not sure where they got the whole \"yelling\" concept from since I can't say I experience that in Japan often. I do appreciate they don't allow people smoke on the patio - its quite small so it makes sense (thgh this would be shocking in Japan haha). Chairs are not very comfy though.  Prices: Decent but it depends on what you order. I felt the salmon natto was a bit overpriced cause the things that go into it are relatively cheap. But the bibimbap and karaage are very well priced for the portion size.  Overall its worth a peak if you do enjoy Japanese food beyond sushi, do try to go a bit early like 5:30-6:00 to avoid the rush.  ----  Update: Second Visit! Came here with a friend of mine whose been to the Vancouver location and figured what better way to feast than on fried goodness. Waited about 45 minutes around 5:30 on a Sat, which seems like a norm for Guu.  Ordered: Kinoko Bibimbap -- again, delicious - must get everyone!! Takoyaki -- again, lol creature of habit but these are the best in the city! Takowasabi -- I see what other diners mean by small portions. This be good for 2 people but if you have a large group this wouldn't be a good sharing portion. Wowza is that wasabi powerful, ha a little overwhelming perhaps Okonomiyaki - hate to say this but I prefer my mom's. As much as the crust is very crispy, I found it made the overall dish a little too hard to eat. Also, if you get this don't get the takoyaki, in theory its the same idea in different shapes) Spicy Negitoro - Mmm also a very good dish. a little small but the fish is freshhh  Also ordered the bamboo cocktail, which was delicious. Very refreshing but not overwhelmingly sweet. An easy drink and goes well with all this fried goodness.  Ha still a few things I'd like to try on their menu so perhaps a third visit will happen."}
{"text":"A fun place to go with a few friends.  The waitstaff look mostly Japanese.  The service was quick and friendly.  I went on a Monday around 6pm.  Although there was a line, I got seated immediately by the bar since I was dining alone.  The place is very noisy as most of the other reviews indicated.  The menu is surprisingly short for an izakaya (at least from my experience in NYC).  My favorite dishes were the kinoko cheese bibimbap and the tori karaage.  The kinoko cheese bibimbap was rice served in a sizzling stone pot, mixed with chunky pieces of garlic-sauteed mushrooms, shredded cheese and a super tasty sauce made of seaweed.  It's such a simple but brilliant dish.  Really appetizing and extremely delicious.    The tori karaage was truly succulent and fried to perfection.  They use dark meat chicken and the chunks of chicken were very well marinated.  The tontoro (grilled pork cheeks) were at first ordinary but then I tasted them with the tiny smudge of yuzu-flavored wasabi/mustard and it was brought to a whole new level.  Such an interesting combination!  The ebi mayo was the biggest disappointment.  Although the shrimp used were fresh, they had too much batter and ended up tasting very ordinary, even with the spicy mayo dressing.  For dessert, I tried the almond cream.  That was a great way to end a heavy meal.  It was like almond-flavored jello.  Not that creamy as it claims on the menu.  But good nonetheless.  Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"THE BEST izakaya restaurant I've been to so far.   The atmosphere is so lively and fun! The loud & welcoming greeting just makes you laugh and smile when you enter. It is really noisy in here, but I thinks it's all part of its \"charm\". Probably not a place you'd want to come to to have an intimate conversation or romantic date though.  All of the food we ordered here was really good and tasty. Everything from the fish collar (special of the night) to their takoyaki was delicious and flavorful. Better to go in a group, so you can try more dishes.   Overall, it's the perfect place to have good food and a fun experience with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Really awesome looking place. Love the set-up/tables and the look of the place.  We were greeted by a very friendly waitress! The menus had so many things we all wanted!! Several of us picked a marinated tuna over rice sort of like a chirashi looking type bowl. It was fantastic! The miso before the meal was some of the best everyone in our group had ever eaten!  Oh, also important- the drinks! The cocktails were really well-priced and good!! The waitress talked us into trying the special green tea cream puff. That was really fantastic! She said this is served at dinner and typically not @ lunch (who knows if that's true but it really doesn't matter to me). Either way, it was excellent and worth coming to Guu all by itself!  I'd come back here over and over. I would definitely suggest coming for lunch. We came toward the end of typical lunch rush and the restaurant was not as jam-packed as I've heard it gets. I understand why- it's fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Yep, it's loud here. All the staff yell at the top of their lungs every time someone enters or leaves. This isn't the place for a quiet night out. It's pretty small inside so definitely make a reservation if you've got a group.   The patio is a quieter option, and it's heated on cold evenings.   Food is fantastic! It's all tapas, so it's best to go with a group and order a variety of small dishes to share. My favourites were the deep fried brie, pork belly, miso black cod, and salmon tartare."}
{"text":"As I was with several other fabulous yelpers I will rely on them to fill in the specifics from our night out for izakaya.  An ode-review for the restaurant Guu Busy busy busy   Screaming japanese Busy busy busy   \"You wait two hours please\" Busy busy busy   Let's walk three blocks to Mike's Busy busy busy   Mr Susan we do like Busy busy busy   Wine and laughter are the norm Busy busy buy   As is the coaster storm Busy busy busy    Scallops are superb Busy busy busy    Open door gets on our nerves Busy busy busy   She's too tied-up to get beer Busy busy busy   Don't expect a refill here Busy busy busy   Enjoyed the evening that's for sure Busy busy busy   Whether in or out the door Busy busy busy   Love the company we keep Busy busy busy    Not always the food we eat Busy busy busy   It was truely a production Busy busy busy   Dishes sized right for a  munchkin Busy busy busy   One should try this once I guess Busy busy busy   But don't feel sad when it's a mess."}
{"text":"This place can accumulate some line up so come early. Typical loud greetings and chants you expect from a Japanese bar from the staff. Friendly. They also do happy birthdays so if you wanna embarrass your friends they might be able to arrange that for you.   Moderate price and bar sized foods. Got their bibimbap and fried chicken. Nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Lively, fun and energizing. Guu is all about the atmosphere. Go there to have a good time and feel at home.   The food is also really good but a little pricey for tapas. For a group of 6 you have to order 2 or more of everything if everyone wants a good size portion. I also recommend getting a few drinks, they're all really nice and have some interesting flavors and what's tapas without a little alcohol.  Servers there are always in a good mode and are excited to serve you. The only problem is there might be a language barrier if you don't speak Japanese or Korean in some cases.  I definitely recommend trying guu at least once. But make sure you go there before the rush cause you'll end up waiting 20+ minutes."}
{"text":"Great place for Japanese tapas. Service always 10/10. Food is always excellent! Sometimes the skewers are a little salty but that's about all the bad things I can say. The drinks are unique and it's a great environment to come with your friends! The sushi is always fresh and the quality is superb. I would highly recommend KINKA IZAKAYA to anyone around church street"}
{"text":"Guu is an \"Izakaya\" or a traditional Japanese bar.  Think of it as Japanese tapas.  It is not important what it is just go to Guu Izakaya.  It is one of the most interesting places to eat in Toronto.  If you like quiet romantic spots, do not go.  If you like a vibrant location with a serious pulse to it, unique food, then go.  However, plan for a 2 hour wait at all times and outside not inside, no matter the weather.  Yes I said it...2 hours.  I have been here at least 6 times and am willing to wait as it is that much fun.   When you get in the whole restaurant stops and greets you in Japanese with \"Irashaimase,\" which means \"welcome.\"  It is loud and alive with chatter.  You sit down and are given their main menu and also a weekly specials menu.  Always order from the specials menu.  Each dish is roughly $10 and fore the most part is a tapas size serving.    Here is a shot of the interior boasting a large family style seating area.  So basically you sit at a communal table and end up sitting beside people to eat or sit at their bar where you can see everything the cooks are doing.  There is so much interesting food and drink choices to choose from so you may have to exercise some control or risk cleaning out the menu as we always do.   Vancouver Uni served with Nori wrappers.  I did not use the nori as Uni is perfect sashimi style.   Sake Shots  Agedashi Tofu or Tofu in a sweet broth (dashi).  Maguro (tuna) Tataki.  Tataki is basically fish cooked rare.  Yummy - Braised cow tongue skewers with a side of mustard.  Salmon Poke.  Poke is a Hawaiian dish where raw fish is dressed with sesame seed oil, seaweed, soya sauce amongst other things.  I ate this everyday in Hawaii.  Giant sized Sapporo Draft.  A staple here with customers of all sizes enjoying.  Salmon Natto served with nori wrappers.  Salmon, natto, quail egg, green onion and cucumbers.  Natto is fermented soya bean and is said to be an acquired taste.  I think it is just great.      Grilled Saba - Mackerel"}
{"text":"Don't see what the hype's all about. The food was good but came scattered and not all at once, which I know is a 'thing' (e.g. Origin Restaurant), but I don't love that. The seating was not great and the staff were... interesting. The yelling was cute. Won't hurry back even though the food was quite good."}
{"text":"Really happening and vibrant place with good food and amazing staff. Sake bombs are a must have."}
{"text":"A very lively experience here! Came here the first time and was seated by the bar which was understandable because it was pretty busy but overall, the Takoyaki balls, baked oysters and chicken wings were bomb. Tip though: Not a place to go to have a conversation or go to on a date unless you wanna be yelling at the top of your lungs haha BUT an excellent atmosphere to go to with friends to have fun and dive into food/drinks :)"}
{"text":"A lively and trendy Japanese restaurant Izakaya in Toronto is near Ryu University. Tapas style dishes dominant here. Should try the sashimi dishes here and the takoyaki too."}
{"text":"Kinka is so much fun! The moment you enter you'll hear the staff cheering for you and smiles are all around you. The food is good, I enjoyed the beef short ribs. Their seating areas are pretty decent and easily fit 8-10 people comfortably, just make sure to make a reservation. The staff is quick and friendly and they really teach you different traditions. It's pretty cool to be in such a positive place, it's guaranteed to make you smile while enjoying good food."}
{"text":"Oh My Goodness. Toronto eats have outdone themselves. I've been thinking about this place since the last time I went, which was 1.5 years ago. It was not a disappointment and even better this time. I realized I want GUU to open in SF so badly. I've never experienced so much fun eating at an izakaya. You know what makes a great place? When the food is outstanding. And when the dishes come out, and people are only curious to know what is that dish on the other side of the bar. I am pretty shy person, but this is the first time, I raised up a conversation with a fellow eater. It all started with, what is that you are having? I was honestly, so curious what slimey seafood conception did he order. The place is outstanding. The place has high energy, is clean, even kid-friendly, creative, tasty, innovative and I think it fully engulfs what eating at an izakaya is all about.   I love GUU. It is all that and worth the visit whenever in TORONTO.  * Salmon Natto Yukke-chopped salmon sashimi w/ seven friend (Natto, Takuan, shibazuke, scallion, cucumber, garlic chips & raw egg) (3.5 of 5) My least favorite dish. However, it is very creative and different. They bring out the salad ingredient, break an egg over it, and whip it into this slimey and frothy mixture. Then, they expect you to wrap it in seaweed and eat it. The salad was fresh, but the texture was too slimey for me. And it bit messy, since I had to eat it with the seaweed. I could pass on this next time, but it was fun to try. * Matcha Au Lait (5 of 5) Delicious, cold, and frothy green tea latte made from their bar. Their drink menu is creative and very tasty.  * Guuu'd Ramune (4 of 5) I couldn't tell the difference, but this ramune is a product of Guu. Tasted like normal Ramune to me. * Takoyaki (5 of 5) Probably one of the best takoyaki I ever ate. The balls were so crispy on the outside and the insides were so creamy. It was so delicious.  * Tontoro - pan fried pork cheek w/ salt & yuzu pepper (5 of 5) Delicious. The pork cheek slices came out juicy and crispy. It was so delicious. * Maguro Tataki - seared B.C. Tuna sashimi w/ ponzu & garlic chips Red snapper over rice and soup (4.5 of 5) Clever rice and soup bowl. Very tasty and none of the components were overwhelming. It was actually a fun taste when you spooned everything and tried to taste it in one bite. There was a lot of sweet and savory complex flavors in this one bowl.  * Gyu tongue - grilled beef tongue with salt (4 of 5) Beautiful taste of grill meat. However, the beef tongue is very lean, and the meat wasn't as moist as I wanted it to be. I feel like this dish would be tastier with a side sauce. * Pan fried bacon wrapped scallop and king oyster mushroom with soy sauce and karashi mayo (5 of 5) Delicious combo. Very tasty and beautiful to eat. * Deep Fried Brie Cheese (4 of 5) Very nicely fried. It came out as beautiful triangles. However, I expected the cheese to be gooey inside, instead, the brie was so soft, it was melted and all gone inside the fried triangle.  * Custard Cheesecake (4 of 5) Not bad, but not a must try. * Kakimayo - Baked Oyster with Spinach, Garlic, Mushroom, and Cheese. (5 of 5) My favorite and it was so delicious. The baked seafood with cheese smelled so good and tasted even better.  This is probably my number one pick for restaurant to go to in Toronto. It is outstanding and I don't think anyone would ever be disappointed. The restaurant energy and food is so amazing, I can only say \"You have to try it yourself.\""}
{"text":"Irasshaimase!  This is probably my favorite dining experience on my Toronto visit.  Guu Izakaya seem to be a very popular place for the locals.  The wait was long but was well worth it.  We showed up around typical dinner time (around 8pm) and the wait was about an hour.  So during the wait you can either hang around outside or just walk to the nearby bars and grab a drink to kill some time.  Even if you're willing to sit at the bar section, the wait is still long.    As soon as you step into this place you'll be greeted by the entire staff with a loud welcome message in Japanese (Irasshaimase!).  And when you leave you'll be greeted once again with a Japanese goodbye message.  The atmosphere and ambiance is great!  Their menu isn't too large but they have enough variety to make it interesting.  Everything we tried here was pretty good.  This is a very authentic Izakaya in my opinion.  The coolest part was watching the staff prepare the food in the middle open-kitchen area.  These guys are extremely busy working their butt off the entire night.  And they're still attentive enough to greet customers as they come and go.  My hats off to them.  If I ever visit Toronto again, this restaurant would be on top of my list to re-visit."}
{"text":"This place is very good! Very unique atmosphere and the taste of the food is amazing..... but the bad thing is that the price is too high for the portions you get. I understand that its mostly a place for drinking but if you don't drink and just go for food, either expect to walk out with $100+ out of your wallet or walk out with an empty stomach. I really just wish the prices were a little cheaper or the portions were larger."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Food is always on point and fairly priced, and they offer daily/weekly items to change things up. Their atmosphere is always lively and welcoming. I've eaten at all their locations. Favourite izakaya in the GTA, they're a chain for a good reason.   ***We had one mishap with reservations for 5 on a weekend once but they addressed it very quickly and were able to seat us anyhow. Brownie points for quick thinking."}
{"text":"This is a solid 4.8/5 , just not a 5 cuz the miso soup was a bit salty thats it. A lil pricey but 100% worth!  We came here for lunch on a monday, and were pleased it was quiet so we could hear eachother during our wedding anniversary celebration! Definitely my fav izakaya. We ordered:   bamboo sake: I'm a simpleton, but this was so cool! normally dont like soju/other hard alcoholic bevies with my food but this was smooth and tasted really nice with the fried stuff. it was $19 for 500mL (small order) but felt like more!  sashimi platter: just fresh fresh sashimi. at first it looked like small portion, but every bite was great and delicious! fresh wasabi and u only need a small bit of soy sauce. I usually soak my sushi in it but not here!  deep fried brie: really great. came with a mango/blueberry sauce, but I'd have died if it was a pear kind of sauce (lovee pear and brie pairings in a sandwich).  fried chicken special with tartar sauce n rice/salad: omg...there looks to be too much sauce at  first, but with the rice it is perfect. Salty enough and they compliment eachother really well!  gyu (beef) carpaccio : you actually see thickness with their carpaccio vs. allucaneat joints, and it is very tasty. no complaints here.   Just a headsup, the seats are not cushioned but we didn't find it uncomfortable at all and we were eating/drinking for a good 1hr. Exeptional service but nobody else was really there hah!"}
{"text":"This place is Guuuuuud. What can I say,  the salmon sashimi is incredible, a must have when you visit,  the deep fried Brie cheese is also good, like,  super good. The staff is super friendly and greet you on your way and on your way out,  it's hard not to smile and have fun when you're visiting Guu. Great deal on pints,  you can get a massive pint of Sapporo for a reasonable price. Great spot for a inexpensive lunch with massive portions. The rice bowls and ramen bowls are massive,  a great lunch deal that can't be beat in this area. Fresh ingredients and Japanese comfort food done right. If you're in the area and in a jam then go to Guu,  you won't regret it.   Only downside is the long wait times,  but you can't blame them for that,  their popularity in justified. Just look at the picture of my lunch, cost me 8 bucks!   I'll be coming back many many times,  especially on Halloween when they have LIVE PERFORMANCES AND EVENTS that happen in the bar and are interactive with everyone,  including the staff, that are geared up in sweet costumes.   It's Guuuuuud times."}
{"text":"Pros:  - Unique atmosphere, - Incredible food ( Miso Soup, Karagee, Pork Belly, Seared Salmon, and Fried Banana with coconut Ice cream). - The fried banana with coconut ice cream in particular was one of the best deserts I've ever had, and is not always available at the other locations. - Fair prices and wide selection of food. - Good service and food doesn't take too long to get to your table even when busy  Cons:  - Can get fairly loud during peak times  I would definitely recommend this restaurant and I think it is the best Kinka location overall."}
{"text":"All our drinks and food were great. Loved seeing the chef's preparing food! The only downside was it was incredibly loud."}
{"text":"Please don't give 9 people half a table and ask them to SQUEEZE, especially after they called and were told they should be able to fit in"}
{"text":"I love how you're greeted loudly in Japanese as soon as you enter. We didn't have to wait too long to get a seat.  The food was super yummy, I really recommend the deep fried octopus balls in mayo and the udon noodles."}
{"text":"I may have to start a yelp list for middle-aged hipsters or at least hipsterish places that are worth the effort for folks who neither have to see nor be seen. Tonight, I stumbled into a place that is far too hip for me and I found the experience delightful.. Guu means the sound of your growling stomach, says my server.  I thought  perhaps it meant extremely hard to find in a sketchy neighbourhood.  Even when standing in front of the restaurant,  I had to ask someone to show me where the door was located  (Encased in plastic sheeting)  Inside, the place is instant energy. Every staff member shouts a greeting in Japanese to every arriving and departing guest. Silly? Sure, but try not to smile. Guu serves Japanese snacks - really tasty, really well prepared. The scallop sashimi I at was worthy of any upscale sushi restaurant - delicate and complex. The deep fried squid balls would be the envy of any Super Bowl party.  Seated at the bar the kitchen staff operates in choreography but it is break dance, not ballet.  Cooks all line up for high fives when I compliment the womderfulness of the food.  A few notes... I visited at 10 pm on a Wednesday . It is as lively and crowded as I can manage. Other yelpers say the waits at peak times are fierce.  The street numbers are messed up. It's at least a block south of where it should be and not really on Church but on the cross street. Look for the little house beside the Indian Take-out place."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is good but the food is not as good as before when they are still named Guu. Ordered chicken karaage and it's under cooked, the inside is still near raw."}
{"text":"Guu is my favourite Japanese restaurant in Toronto. Every time I go I willingly wait 45 minutes to be seated because the food is worth it. Upon entry, you are greeted in Japanese by all the staff who boisterously welcome you. Don't expect to eat sushi here because that's not the type of Japanese food they specialize in. The kinoko bibimbap and baked oysters are my two favourite dishes (I'd highly recommend them!), and I crave them on a daily basis. The prices are reasonable but the portions are pretty small so you'll end up spending a decent amount in the end if you want to get full. At the end of the day, it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"The food is consistently phenomenal and the atmosphere is never dull. Get yourself a glass of Sapporo (on tap) and enjoy these tasty Japanese tapas!"}
{"text":"Their food is ok to good.  The music was so loud, I couldn't even talk to the person infront of me. I felt like I was completing with the craziness the entire time.  Our table had to leave in order to hold any sort of conversation.  The energy is always high which is good for the most part, but taking it down a notch or two would be great."}
{"text":"Guu Izakaya is a fun place with tasty tapas and a loud, energetic staff of cooks and servers. The first time I walked in, I was pleasantly surprised when they all yelled \"Irasshaimase!\"  The tapas are a little on the pricey side, but they're all super delicious. I really liked the beef tongue, baked oysters, and ikapiri calamari. I also recommend the Asian-inspired cocktails. My favourite was the bamboo cocktail (melon liqueur, white wine, lychee juice and soda).   I never had any trouble with any language barriers, so no worries there. It does get pretty loud inside, so if you're looking for a quiet, low-key restaurant, this probably isn't the place for you. Also, the place is really busy, so be prepared to wait for a table. One time, my friends and I were ushered to this little side area where we could order drinks while we waited. Another time, they took down my friend's cell number and texted her when there was room available for us. Both times, it was probably around a 30 - 40 minute wait.   Overall, Guu Izakaya is a great bar with a lively atmosphere and cute Japanese staff."}
{"text":"guusanity   I thought it fitting to visit the first Toronto Guu before I head back to origins of Guu.  I liked the Sakabar, and the Izakaya was comparable.  Full disclosure dictates that I tell you my favourite thing about Guu isn't the food - it's the cocktails.  The same thing that annoys me abou tall Guus annoyed me - the incessant yelling - but that's no one's fault, I just happen to be more grandma than I look.  My three buddies and I knew better so we went at 6:00 pm.  Great timing, a minute wait and then our insane meal began.  I think we ordered one of everything, including the deluxe size almond tofu.  Here's a random sample of our meal, enjoy, don't forget to wipe the drool: ebi mayo, scallop wrapped in bacon, unagi rice, fried brie, and my absolute favourite of the night - the baked oyster.    All in all it was good.  Not everything was amazing, but nothing is horrible.  We might have overdosed on the fried items and the risk in doing so is that everything starts to taste the same.  Again, VanGuu is better than TOGuu...I suppose it's a good thing I'm going back then isn't it.  We ended the night by sharing the giant size amond tofu - surprisingly yummy.  I don't usually like tofu desserts, but the almond flavour was subtle and the texture of the tofu was heavenly."}
{"text":"We were looking for a great Asian restaurant while on a work trip and were extremely happy with this place. They yell at you when you walk in so don't be alarmed. We sat outside on the patio which was very nice and quieter than inside. We had a delicious kimchi / grilled pork rice bowl which I would definitely recommend. The cocktails were fun and very well priced. We also loved the baked oyster and salmon tataki. I would avoid the fired banana dessert. Overall great spot!"}
{"text":"What did you say?!  Japanese tapas - what a fun concept. Be prepared to shout to your dinner partner all night as the servers are constantly yelling in japanese. The atmosphere is lively and welcoming however it will not be a quiet meal. The décor is rustic, untreated wood with hanging light bulbs, and open kitchen facing. We sat at the bar facing the kitchen/grill and got to see all the action. The menu was organized well.   Marinated octopus w wasabi stem - loved this and it will clear your sinuses Deep fried kabocha pumpkin croquette w hard-boiled egg - a bit dry, good flavor Rice, mushroom, cheese w seaweed bibimbap - seaweed was a unique touch Hamachi - fresh and sweet Fried Cod Nuggets w dipping sauce - a bit dry, good flavor Warm Guu Sake - delicious  Cheerful/fast service with visually pleasing/flavorful dishes"}
{"text":"Went there once a week on average, cus it's very close to my place. It's a very good izakaya, including the interior decoration, the services, the food, and both the alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. It also has some special menu on different events like Holloween and Christmas. This place is always crowded, so a reservation could save a lot of time."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant of all time so far, and I've been to plenty. The experiences have always been fun, yummy and memorable."}
{"text":"Phenomenal Japanese food that has variety beyond your typical sushi and tempura. Serving sizes are more akin to tapas, so order multiple items and share with friends! The mixed drinks are also great (lychee juice was awesome) and the atmosphere/service is very very friendly. A great spot to celebrate or go to on the weekend!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here since Guu days but was pleasantly surprised to find their menu hasn't changed much at all. Interior is cozy with dim lighting. The atmosphere is lively and the servers are very enthusiastic so expect lots and lots of shouting when you enter and throughout your whole meal - it's all part of the experience.  For our drinks we got the Kinka Fizz and the Sky of Tokyo - both cocktails were delicious and refreshing!  We shared the kinoko bibimbap, chicken karaage, hotate scallops, takoyaki, and salmon tataki. I would highly recommend the kinoko bibimbap - it's basically mushrooms, cheese, and rice served in a stone bowl and it tastes good! The karaage was good but I found the pieces to be too big for my liking. Scallops were so fresh, reminds me of the ones from Japan. The takoyaki is decent and you can't ever go wrong with ordering their salmon tataki served with garlic chips.  Fun place to go for a date or with friends! Food-wise I give it 3.5 stars because for me only a few of their dishes are memorable enough to be repeat orders - the rest are decent or average. The portions can also be rather small for the price. I have to say that the drinks are really good here though and same with the service so +0.5 stars for that!"}
{"text":"You will be greeted with tremendous excitement when you walk in! Expect the noise level to stay really high throughout your meal. You will likely over indulge as a result and end up stumbling out!  Ambiance aside, the food is very good and represents Japanese izakaya very well.   Highlights are the Natto Yuke, very well executed and table side service to mix it all together. Also recommend the carbonara - fusiony but a brilliant guilty pleasure!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Izakaya in the city. Food is amazing - top dish by far is the grilled cod. Takes a bit of time but worth the wait. Speaking of waiting, be prepared to wait for quite a while at this place - but again, worth it! Yeah it costs a bit more than other spots but honestly - you get far more than you pay for at this Guu.  The other Guu, the Sakabar at Bloor and Bathurst, is pretty good too, but this one is the original (in Toronto anyway) and by far the greatest.  Also unless there's a special the desserts are kind of lame, so take that room you've been saving for dessert and have another gyu carpaccio!"}
{"text":"This is the best Izakaya in Toronto. The staff great you warmly when you arrive and the energy continues through the meal. Everything on the menu is excellent."}
{"text":"The greeting you receive from the time you walk into the restaurant and when you walk out is unbelievable. Lol  The food here is like food for the soul. Every bite your take is amazing and full of flavor. I would recommend ordering a few dishes to share our favorites were the agedashi tofu, the stone pot rice with mushroom, the Yaki udon, and the buttery salmon sashimi. It was absolutely delicious, service was fast, and the ambience was definitely exciting as the chefs and servers were yelling throughout the night."}
{"text":"review is based on lunch menu experience: not sure if there was always a lunch menu when it was guu. had the tempura udon for lunch and was disappointed. tempura was soggy and selection was meh. the soup base was pretty salty as well. will definitely try other lunch menu items and update review  dinner menu is definitely great!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you like tapas, Asian fusion, and an energetic eating environment.  The best time to come here is on a rainy weekday, because they don't take reservations and sometimes the wait can be long. As soon as you enter, employees will yell greetings in Japanese, and you can be hustled to either a long wooden table or the bar area. While sitting by the bar can be a little cramped and feel claustrophobic, it's more fun to watch food being prepared in the kitchen.  Each item ranges from $6 to $10, and they will have a specials menu written on paper. While the specials are not very descriptive, the waiters are always open to explaining each item.  To be honest, I haven't been too impressed with certain items -- I generally prefer their hot items over their cold (such as salads and tartares). Some salads may contain cooked fish, which give off a very strong \"fishy\" taste and smell that is overwhelming at times.  Overall, a great place to eat for an entertaining meal!"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying I've probably eaten here 5 times in the past because I live nearby and I have loved it every single time. The food is amazing. I am constantly referring other people to this place, because the food is so great. But I recently had an experience there that completely shocked me.   My boyfriend and I had dinner there, and even though I had a reservation we were immediately told by the host that there was a 2 hour seating limit. Fine. I get that they want to turn over tables quickly, but I find it a bit rude to be told before I even sit down that I need to be gone in 2 hours.   We tried to get past this awkwardness and ordered two round of food with drinks, and were ready to order our dessert when the waitress informed us that this was \"last call\". My boyfriend and I looked at each other, completely baffled. I asked, \"As in OUR last call?\" We had only been there an hour and 15 minutes...and they were essentially telling us to hurry up and get out. My boyfriend was so upset he could hardly speak, so I ordered dessert and plum wine for us. Dessert and drinks were of course awesome. The food here is amazing. But I have never been so embarrassed in my life.   After we paid the bill (we still got out of there with 20 minutes left on our 2 hour time limit) and left, my boyfriend asked, \"Are we riffraff?\" And I guess I had to say that we were, because that's definitely how we were treated. We were seated by the door and I listened pretty carefully to see if anyone else was told immediately about the time limit, and I really don't think anyone else was. We were both dressed nicely, just came from work...it was just very confusing and strange.   There are a lot of other well-reviewed izakaya's in the city, and we will definitely be trying one of those before coming back."}
{"text":"This update is long overdue. The Izakaya craze seems to have mellowed out a bit and has brought in a bit of competition. One benefits from these things like for starters we were able to reserve seating even on a Friday evening which is great.  The main menu items have remained consistent which is great. Sadly same goes for the service i.e. 2 hour limit on seating. Not sure whether they should still do that as the idea of a pub IMO means you eat, you drink you talk and you enjoy the company you are in with a relaxed mode. The sound here is deafening as our group already had noise fatigue at the 2 hour long sitting here.  Also a bummer on the service part that even though we mentioned that there were two birthday's being celebrated in our group we didn't even get a birthday wish! nada! zilch!   We weren't expecting any freebies but I think this is expected from them. There was a mix up again in our order which can happen in such a noisy spot. I will remember to point to a dish on the menu next time :)  As for the food It has remained consistent so kudos for that.  3 stars."}
{"text":"With limited access to LTE out of the country and needed to pick something quick, decided to trust fellow yelp reviewers and thought to myself, \"over hundreds of reviews and 4 stars couldn't go wrong right?\" Boy was I wrong. Should have at least tried to read some of the reviews on why the 4-5 star reviews which seems to be more for ambiance and drinks. But here is my take.  Ambiance: Lighting dimmed in indoor seatings. Very loud inside. Not the music but like many yelpers say \"the staff are extremely energetic and screams as a group whenever customers come in and leave.\" To be honest, very different but kind of creepy to me when all eyes (staff and customers starts staring at you). They also have outdoor seatings, so guess where we chose to sit? Outside! This place is great for the more loud, partying and drinking like environment. More for the younger crowds or a happy hour with coworkers.   Service: was great as all the staff are nice and again energetic.  Food/Cost: This is the bad part. Sorry to offend the ones in love with this place but there is nothing really good about it. To have to pay a premium for the smallest portions ever which wasn't too yummy makes it a triple whammy. How I calculate whats a good place is if Im going to pay a premium, i expect a reason for it. Is it the environment like a crazy view on top of a tower, an ocean view etc? No. Is there a special dish that stands out which no other place can make where you can state \"because I can charge that much and give you an appetizer size (or even smaller) amounts of food?\" No. So why the 4-5 star reviews?  My thoughts and reading other reviews was more on the bar/drink side of this place, if anything. Their drinks are very interesting, looks good with a different twist. Rather than a typical mojito, they would have sake mixes or vodka with calpico which are probably delicious (but i can't really review on that area since I couldn't drink that day, darn).  Our foods: - Seared tuna: Not the freshest we've had. Quite fishy. - Takoyaki: The octopus pieces were cut too largely *see picture* and the Worcestershire sauce was too overwhelming and sour. Should have mixed it a little lighter. Comes in 4 pcs. -Sashimi salad: just full of lettuce, little bit of dressing, only about 4-6pcs of sashimi which was not too fresh either. Since it was a salad, they were actually leftover end cuts of sashimi. For $8.90, I would expect better cuts of sashimi. - Goma-ae: Yelpers posting should at least post how many spinach balls there would be in each order. In one picture I saw, there were 2. $4.50 for an appetizer isn't extreme but to get only 1 small ball of spinach, a bit steep yo. Not bad though. A bit on saltier side and again, too costly for 1 ball. - Fried Chicken wings: 6pcs. This was probably the best dish. Lightly fried and flavored. Reminds me of Korean style fried chicken which i had in Cali which is way better."}
{"text":"Quite different from what you'd expect from a regular sushi bar or Japanese restaurant - upon walking in, all the staff will heartily shout out greetings (and goodbyes when you leave). The food is great, with the menu containing both more traditional and innovative offerings.   Food: Individual portions are small and cheap, the point being so that you can order a multitude of things to sample. They had sweet shrimp sashimi as a special that day; the shrimps were served with the heads still on which I had never experienced before, but was very fresh. I'd recommend the karaage (fried chicken) and black cod; both were very good. We also tried the fried brie cheese among others, which was interesting: crunchy on the outside, warm and gooey on the inside, served with a sweet mango dressing.  Service: Servers here are enthusiastic and friendly and food comes out pretty fast and at a consistent pace. They're attentive as well, coming by periodically to refill drinks.  Setting: Very cool vibe overall - tables are mostly communal benches, although there are also smaller/more private tables available. Came here with a friend early and managed to get our own table, although it was very cramped, with the table being almost the same width as the stool. The place is loud, but the high ceilings and bright interior give the place an airy and cheerful atmosphere.  No reservations here! Show up early or be prepared to wait in line for a long time. Although their food is certainly very good, the dishes are quite small and it definitely starts adding up fast, especially if you want to walk away full. My friend and I ended up paying ~$50 each (including 1 drink each)."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Service was bad; we had to get up to ask the serves three times for water, wasabi, and tea. The only time they actually came up to our table was to order food and give us our bill. They blast the music like it's a night club and cheer and scream every 10 seconds so not the ideal place where you want to have any sort of conversation with someone."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the unique dishes... but could do without all the screaming & yelling every time someone enters / leaves the restaurant.     I stopped by on a Saturday evening after the Leafs game (around 10pm) and only waited about 10 minutes for a table. Try to time your weekend visits towards the end of the evening and you will avoid larger crowds / lineups.   I thought the food was exceptional and unique. I enjoyed the following dishes:  - Yakiudon - fantastic! Best noodle dish ever. Pan fried Udon noodles, beef, scallions and mushrooms. Sounds simple but still dreaming of this dish. I will \"double down\" on this one next time.   - Maguro Tataki - Stupid good! Seared BC Tuna Sashimi that just melts in your mouth. A complete steal at $7 for 5-6 pieces.   - Sashimi Salad - We have another winner. Sashimi was so fresh and the BC Tuna (from above) was the star of the show again.  - Kinoko Bibimbap - rice, mushrooms, seaweed sauce and cheese served in a hotpot. Sure sounded odd, but tastes great. The cheese is the star on this one.   - Black Cod - Also very good but the portion is a little small for the $12 price tag.  - Karubi - Salt & Pepper beef ribs. Probably my least favourite dish but not bad. Tasted a little oily.  Dishes are great for sharing and priced reasonably. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu. They also have daily specials (with some fish from Japan) but they were all sold out by the end of the day.   I like sitting at the bar area so you can watch the food being cooked.  Highly recommended but be warned... it's loud. Just grab a beer, order some good food and try to block out all the screaming.  Bonus - Mouthwash / mini-cups in the washrooms.  BK"}
{"text":"A lot of yelling and confusion when you walk in the door. Don't worry though, you'll be joining in once you get settled. Amazing selection of food, all small plates to be hoarded or shared. Energetic servers and jumbo sapporo's on tap for $9! The communal tables are great for stealing ideas for your next dish or drink."}
{"text":"I'm glad that they've added more locations here in Toronto, but the line ups here are still heartbreaking on weekends and Friday nights. Once you do get in, however, order the menu (such tasty food) and don't think about your wallet."}
{"text":"food:  the super tasty stuff: Salmon n 7 friends, cheese and mushroom bibimbap, tuna sashimi, fried bree with mango sauce, grilled oyster, stir fry beef udon noodles, puffy fish cake in soup...all were very tasty!  ...the not so yummy stuff we've tried: cow tongue( cut so think its a bit gross) fried chicken: very avarage.   Atmosphere: Staff is super friendly n super welcoming, but they r way too loud, but i guess that's their thing? bf said canadians who goes there will think \"wow the japanese are so roudy n loud!\" but actually in japan they don't really do that.....it makes it almost too hard to enjoy the food...but u get used to it after the 3rd visit....drinking helps too!  the wait is usually 45mins to a hour outdoor, sometimes they bring u from the outside to the patio, but its kinda pointless since u dun get to order anything other than drink on the patio. Other days they skip the patio n bring u straight to the seat.( haven't gone there during winter yet)   As for the table, I don't mind sharing tables with strangers, but I think they pack too many people per table it makes it so crowded, they did have a thoughtful design which no one seems to notice is that, there is actually a shelf space under ur chair for purses n bags etc. Funny how no one bother telling you so. So you see all these women eating with their purse on their lap.( including myself until my 3rd visit!)  Table gets so crowded if u order a bit extra, then it starts to occupied too much space on the table, n then u feel bad to intruding other people table space... so i perfer to sit @ the bar. its nice there since you can watch them prepare your food, n also make it easier to get service.  Overall, food n presentation is pretty good, a bit pricy(which is OK since its worth it) so: 4.5 star  Setting n atmosphere: 2 star"}
{"text":"My absolute favourite sushi spot!! Always fresh and unique. Daily special are a must try every time. Love the tapas style, makes it so much fun for the table and keeps the cost reasonable. You can't help but be in a good mood while your in the restaurant!! So much energy and an overall EXPERIENCE restaurant!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place was a bit hard to find. I almost got hit by a car, and was wandering around aimlessly until I found this place. Once I walked in, everyone in the building yelled at me to greet me. Atmosphere was amazing, food was amazing, and most important of all, the service was amazing."}
{"text":"Fun place to go to, excellent food.  If you're willing to spend a little more then they've also got a good assortment of drinks and also the daily specials that change all the time.  I have to say my experience there was better when they first opened (when you used to have to wait 1-2 hrs to get a seat) but then it's still great quality.  Just don't go expecting to be able to have a comfortable conversation because it's LOUD there.  But enjoy it for it's atmosphere and it'll be a great night out!  Love their big jugs of sapporo draft for under $10!"}
{"text":"The energy for this restaurant is amazing! I've never experienced servers and cooks with such energy! It's really loud in here so be prepared the scream. I got the 8 course meal, which was $25/person. I thought it was a really good deal! We got to try most of their famous dishes. The portion size was perfect for two people. I recommend coming here for birthdays because it seems like a great place to celebrate with some friends!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service can be improved! Felt we were being rushed out, was warned when we first arrived that we had 2hrs to eat then again 1/2bfr 2hrs was up. Language was a bit of a barrier so our order was messed up. We wanted to order more food but since our order got messed up our 2hrs was almost up & our bill arrived bfr we can ask! Going out to eat is so expensive these days that customers should never feel rushed when eating as long as food is being ordered! Overall, it was ok, the food made up for the lack of service."}
{"text":"I'd recommend Coming during the dinner hour. Great atmosphere and we enjoyed the food and drinks.   However tried it for lunch as well and just wasn't that impressed. The dishes were pretty small and quite expensive for what they were. Also the stuff they serve on the lunch menu (which is very limited) just didn't taste very good. It was atmosphere was a lot less energetic than dinner too.   So in summary I'd give this place 2 star for lunch and 4 for dinner. So average out to 3."}
{"text":"This place always does the job of filling my appetite and my taste for Sapporo on tap.  Can't say enough good things about this place as it is my go to for Japanese tapas and Japanese Sake and Beer.  Will be coming back again for more soon!"}
{"text":"Such a fun experience, a little bit pricey for such small portions. My oyster had a little sand in it which was disappointing. I got the Brie Cheese ($8.90), Kakimayo ($9.30), Kinoko Bibimbap ($10.30) and the Ebimayo ($9.30). I couldn't get much more cause the meat wasn't Halal. Overall this was an appetizer for me and we had to eat dinner somewhere else afterwards."}
{"text":"Nothing to say but \"Awesome!\"  Took my girl here, today. It's her first and she LOVES IT!  I've been here multiple times with group of friends but decided to take my girl since we're on vacation this week. She doesn't like to wait and knowing her...she'll leave if we've waited outside. Knowing they opened at 5pm, we went when they opened. Got the corner 2 people seats (quite and private) compared to other seating arrangements. Is a little cold since it's close to door opening and closing. I let her order cause I know they're all delicious! She was impress...every thing was a HIT and no misses. I did warn her, it'll be noisy.  We've ordered 5 dishes (kimchi udon, sea urchin & shrimp sashimi, grilled pork intestine, grilled oysters, and grill saba), 2 asahi black beer, and 2 cocktails. Price came to $107.00 with tax and tip."}
{"text":"I would give this place 2.5 stars but decided for Toronto standards, 3 is sufficient.    It seems that people are starting to realize the novelty of this place is the experience of it all.  All the employees are friendly and efficient.  The decor is pretty cool with the communal dining benches, industrial lighting, and use of stone with the little square peepholes.  The food, however, is just \"alright\".    Going on a Wednesday @5:30pm was ideal since there was no line (the place was actually quite empty).  I believe it wasn't 'til 6:30pm when the restaurant was consistently full.  As my group of four left at 7:30pm, we saw around 15 people waiting outside.   As for the food, we ordered a pretty good selection of dishes.  (Please excuse the fact that I do not know all the dishes by the Japanese names.)   Takoyaki: octopus balls each with a tiny piece of octopus but otherwise, pretty authentic in texture and flavour.  5 for 5 bucks?  A bit overprice considering the lack of octopus.  Ebimayo: Fried shrimp with Japanese mayo.  Simple and ok.  You get six.  Pork cheeks:  Surprisingly tasty and with interesting texture.  Eel on rice: I think the cheese brought this dish together.  Again, ok.  Scallop wrapped with bacon and enoki mushrooms wrapped with bacon:  Nothing special, can't go wrong with bacon!  Black cod: Sauce was very good but the texture of the fish just wasn't quite right.  It should be silky...  Maguro tataki:  It was ok.  Again, texture of the fish didn't do it for me.  Scallop sashimi:  This was delicious.  If only the slices of scallop were thicker...  Natto yukke:  I always describe this as slimy to newbies.  Not the preferred texture to many (especially with the raw egg mixed in).  I actually think you lose the salmon and tastes of the other ingredients.     Dessert was fried banana with ice cream:  There was a plastic-y taste to the banana for some reason.  Didn't enjoy this one at all.  So, there you go: A fun (loud) place to have some drinks with friends and snack on some unique dishes.  Not worth a two hour wait, but hey, as long as I'm not the one waiting!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing for a party of friends and has great foods to share among your friends. Love the variety too. The spicy is super spicy! Highly recommend for parties!!!"}
{"text":"I always go to this place during my university study, it's very close to Ryerson.food is good but little expensive."}
{"text":"A perfect Japanese izakaya in the heart of downtown Toronto? Yes please!   This was the best meal we had in Toronto. We came here just after driving through a blizzard, and I was starving. I needed a few drinks after the trip too. We had to wait a bit for a table, since it was a Saturday night, but we went around the corner to a cozy little Starbucks, and had a cup of coffee to pass the time.  Once we were seated, everything was great. The service was on point, and the food came out so fast. I was excited to see they had sochu, and could make us a couple of chu-hi cocktails!   We had the tuna tataki, which was fresh, and with just a bit of a sear on it. I was so excited to see they had takoyaki, grilled octopus balls, and it was great, with just the perfect amount of sauce. The unagi doria was good, but there was something weird about having cheese on my unagi. We finished with okonomiyaki, which a lot of people call a \"Japanese pancake\", but is so much more than that, with flavorful sauce and cabbage baked right in.  No, they don't have sushi, but not all Japanese food is sushi! I love that they had traditional izakaya food, and I would be here every weekend if I lived in Toronto."}
{"text":"Very delicious food but really expensive. So far the best experience I have with this style in Toronto. There is one on Dundas near Ryerson on the 2nd floor but the food is not as good. I just wish there was more room available at this location."}
{"text":"I was invited to this location for a free tasting.  Every time someone arrives or leaves, the staff all yell a greeting or goodbye in Japanese. So enthusiastic! This is not a quiet place, if that's what you're looking for.  There are a lot of choices for seating, long tables, bar seating, or 2 person tables. It has nice high ceilings, great lighting and an open kitchen.  They have a fantastic party menu that lets you try a little bit of everything. it changes periodically, but the food that was on the tasting menu before, is still available on the regular menu.  For the length of the review, I'll only post my favourites. There were no items I didn't like, but there were a few a liked a LOT.  The Hotate Carpaccio(hokkaido scallop sashimi in wasabi sauce) was delightful. The sauce wasn't spicy, it was a cream sauce with hints of wasabi. Mmmm.  Karaage was the tastiest, juiciest fried chicken I've had in a long time. It came with a side of garlic mayo. It was perfect.  Kaki Mayo, a oyster served with cheese, mushrooms and spinach, was almost my favourite item. It is a unique dish. Served on a giant clamshell, it was salty, savoury, cheese and interesting all at the same time. You've got to try it.  The Gindara, grilled black cod with saikyo miso & white wine sauce was my favourite. I'm terrible at chopsticks, but was still able to manage this. The cod absorbed of the flavours right through. So good.  If you like desserts, try the Almond Tofu! It tastes like the liquor, Disaronno. I'd get it again!  Service was great, but this WAS a tasting. I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This is a great tapas restaurant with a very nice atmosphere. Food is delicious and service is very friendly. Drinks can be expensive depending on whAt you order. It isn't the biggest restaurant so you may have to Wait if you come with a big group. Love how they always shout a welcoming when you go in!"}
{"text":"Guu! How I love you! All your locations in Vancouver were not enough for me had led me to this moment where my absolute one thing I must do while in the city was go to Guu. And you did not disappoint.  A long wait, as is familiar, but there were seats outside, so that was a bonus. The space inside was crazy cramped for something so fancy, that it felt a bit strange, but we rolled with it. Service was quick, drinks were yummy, the familiar noisiness made me feel right at home, and the second the food arrived I knew you were still awesome.   The jellyfish vermicelli salad was few times smaller than the one back in Vancouver, but still flavoured the same so it was a good way to start off. The Amuri Salmon and Maguro Tataki were both delicious, although I wished the salmon was sockeye. The sashimi salad had two delicious amaebi shrimp on top, but little dressing, so the salad was quite plain. We ordered the Ebi Avocado Mayo off the specials sheet, and I was so happy to see two avocado halves arrive stuffed with shrimp where the pit should be and topped with mayo, warmed in the oven. It was heaven, and it was filling! I loved it, it's a nice twist from the regular ebi mayo I normally get. The takoyaki were pretty much regular, nothing exciting about them. The Gindara was another fantastic order, but only because I'm crazy in love with black cod.   We ended the evening with the almond tofu, another delicious choice. You can easily drop $30 - $40 here (with one drink each), but I already knew going in that I was there for the food, not to get full. Still, the avocado really did it in for me, so I left super happy and even passed up post-dinner gelato.   Thank you Guu for not disappointing me. I promise I'll try your second location when I'm back again. Until then, I'll mosey my way back to Guu Garden :)"}
{"text":"what kind of garbage do they serve here? its all so greasy and buttery...i felt sick after...and waiting for 2 hours to get in? way over hyped...the ambiance is not bad which is why i gave this place ONE star...otherwise it would have gotten zero...stay away..people who know what izakaiya's should know that this place is pretty bad..."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere for a large group. Will get very loud. Food is tasty but the bill can rack up pretty quickly!"}
{"text":"Loved the ambience and the sake drink. Really a great place to hang out with friends or someone who you know for a while. Cause there was a couple sat beside me who probably just at their first couples of dates, and they have to yell at each other because it's really noisy in here."}
{"text":"I am definitely wavering between a 3 or a 4 star experience; however, I have to go towards the lower end because if you isolate the food from the atmosphere, for the price it's just \"a-ok\".  There are two pay parking lots right across the street, but street parking in the area is plentiful and FREE after 9 pm! so don't settle and park near the houses.  Arrived around 9:15 on a Saturday night.  I always request bar seating because the communal tables and even the separate tables are just too spaced apart to be able to hear the person you're dining with.  Also then you get to watch the cooks prepare the food, and you get both a hidden cubby under the chair for your purse and hooks under the counter for your jacket (otherwise you have to hang your coat up on a coat rack in the middle of the room).  While you wait for your table, you can sit in their heated outdoor 'room' and have some drinks.  I recommend the Lulu Melon if you like sweet drinks (be sure to mix it before consuming).  All staff are attentive, friendly and efficient.   HUGE props to their bathrooms which are so nice they even have a guest book for you to sign while you're in one.  Food ranges from pretty blah and mediocre to really delicious, and I've found through the years, these opinions range from person to person. Last night my dining companion (who had never even heard of Guu!) was in love with the bacon wrapped scallops and mushrooms; I'm a huge fan of the octopus wasabi appetizer myself.  Really great for a date, or a fun evening out.  Definitely must go once."}
{"text":"Woah. This place is amazing! Made reservation at 5pm which is right when they open for dinner. It's not too difficult to make reservation and it gets crowded pretty fast (which totally makes sense) so I'd say make a reservation on Yelp beforehand if you can.  Bf and I ordered the $25/person set, which comes with a variety of dishes. EVERY SINGLE DISH WAS GOOD. I especially love the bibimbap - there's no meat inside, which is how I usually like my bibimbap to be, but it is so flavorful and delicioussssss! The beef is also amazing. It's grilled to the perfect stage and you really tastes the juiciness and flavor. The fried Brie cheese was a bit too heavy for both of us, but you're gonna love it if you are a cheese lover.   Bf says he's definitely going to come back for the season menu ($29/person) while he's still in Toronto. Sadly I left sooner - but I'm almost certain that he's gonna be as happy as this time :)"}
{"text":"Great value! Tried numerous tapas dishes, including grilled cod (yum), sashimi salad, sweet vancouver shrimp sashimi, bimimbap (took 45 minutes, but well worth the wait), seafood ceviche, octopus balls, vancouver tuna sashimi.. All extremely tasty! The sauces used are phenomenal and dishes come out quick.  Nothing disappointed me.  The smaller the group, the easier it is to get it. Expect to wait. Go early on a weekday to get in quicker.  If you don't like loud places, this isn't the place for you.  They scream and yell in japanese as you enter and leave. Kind of funny."}
{"text":"Went there for summerlicious with my roommate. Noisy environment, but typical Japanese Bar style (yes, I checked with my Japanese friend ; ) Food is the average level, fresh, worth the money. Also has other combos with similar price out of summerlicious event. Nice place for get together with friends and drink."}
{"text":"What a great spot!  Reasonably priced, great atmosphere, friendliest staff and even the food tastes good!  The tapas are great and unique!  Not your usual sushi joint.  You can't help but smile and wave back when the entire restaurant shouts out a greeting to you.    I wonder how the staff manage to keep their voice and hearing though with all the synchonized shouting going on all night....."}
{"text":"I discovered this place as a friend of mine was a waitress there at the time.   My review of this place will be short, simple and honest.   This place is always loud and buzzing due to the entire staff yelling greetings and goodbyes. Most people can't stand it! I LOVE IT! Maybe because I got a few screws lose in my head, but this feels like home!!!   As for the food. KARRAGE! OCTOPUS! BEEF TONGUE! RAMUNE! :'P"}
{"text":"When we selected this restaurant my friend said \"It's pretty loud. It's an experience.\" Guu Izakaya did not disappoint!  When we arrived the staff all shouted in greeting. We came on Sunday at around 8:15 with no reservation. The restaurant was full, but we only had to wait 15 minutes for a table. We were lucky, got a 2 person table beside a wall.  The majority is communal tables, which I don't love.  I was very happy to be beside a wall as I felt it wasn't as loud.   Make no mistake, this place is LOUD, BRIGHT,  with hard wooden seats. It's very casual, and it's fun and delicious!  We had: Marinated Jelly fish - delicious in sesame oil and a bit spicy. Very chewy Sashimi salad - I would have preferred this if it were on seaweed, but it's a good size salad and the dressing is yummy.  Beef carpaccio - So tasty we ordered 2! Toasted garlic chips make this dish heavenly. Tuna steak - This was Ok. It was a bit tough. A tasty bite with a weird after taste. Yellow tail sashimi - good, but nothing special.  Black Cod - I would have liked this better if there was more sauce, but we dipped it in the sauce from the yellowtail and it was quite tasty.   There were delicious looking deep fried options which I saw other tables ordering, as well as some yummy looking deserts, but I eat on the lighter side, so I can't speak for them. But MAN they looked YUMMY! In fact, if I go back on a cheat night maybe I'll try some and modify this review.   I recommend going to Guu Izakaya for a fun casual night, when you're in the mood for something a bit different. It definitely is an experience!"}
{"text":"AMAZING food ! All of the dishes that my party ordered were very flavourful and tasty. No complains whatsoever about the food.  However, the service was on the fence. There were 6 of us squished in a little corner that was only meant for 4, which was uncomfortable. We had to ask for water 3 times before we got some. I dropped my chopsticks and asked a waiter for another pair, and never got any.   and yes, be prepared to be yelled at every single time someone walks in the door, sits down, walks out the door, and random orders as well. I found it to be a little too loud; the staff was already loud AND they still turned up the music. I couldn't even hear my friend sitting beside me.   It was a good experience, but we ended up leaving and continuing our meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"(4.5*) The atmosphere here is more lively than the one on Bloor and Bathurst (and noiser) which was great for a birthday party.   1. The tuna tataki and salmon tataki was okay (bathurst location has better).   2. I'm vietnamese so when I saw their \"jelly fish\" salad I was like uh... that better be some other different variety of jellyfish or thats just what we call fish whiskers lol. No flavour and the texture was wierd like its not the jellyfish I'm used to eating and it certainly was the texture of fish whiskers.   3. The Salmon Natto Yuuke NEVER DISAPPOINTS HERE (if you dont care about the slimy texture which is similar to the tako wasabi) mostly because this location does it with kimchi and okra so the explosion of flavours was just mind blowing.   4. The salmon tatare was pretty good but i think it would've been better with wonton crisps instead of seaweed; would definately pay more if they substituted it.   5. The chicken karaage here was the bomb so juicy on the inside and that perfect crispiness on the outside.   6. The rockefeller oysters here also are so fucking good. If kinkas good at something its definately the consistency of their karaage and their baked oysters because I keep coming back for these two dishes specifically.   7. Also had the sashimi salad, meh nothing special.  8. The sake bombs were also okay, they were like in red party cups lol (nome is flashier and uses glass cups so the clink is so much more satisfying hahah).  Overall was okay. I don't really like the variance between different kinka's cause id like to frequent one you know? I mean their consistency is done right with their oysters and karaage and the atmosphere is just right for hella hype which is great but I guess its just a preference thing eh. Different places have their own take on a dish but i hope these differences stay small otherwise why have the same name hahah."}
{"text":"This is my ALL time favourite Japanese Restaurant. The Loud and energetic atmosphere compliments the AMAZING food !!! From cheesy baked oysters to seared salmon served on a bed of white radish and sprinkled with golden garlic crisps.   Top 3 things to try at Guu Izakaya:   1. Seared Salmon  2. Baked Oysters 3. Cheese Bi Bim Bap"}
{"text":"Was in Toronto for vacation and I heard this place is really good. Went to try it out with family nice place and friendly service. Only down side was it got a little to loud in there for my kids but overall the food was great and the service was wonderful glad I had the chance to try it out."}
{"text":"I must say it is an amazing restaurant. As Asians, when we saw the menu at first, we did not expect much because we realized this is not a traditional Japanese restaurant. But, but, but when the first strip of Udon touched my taste buds, they were totally conquered immediately! At last, we almost ordered three forth of the dishes in the menu and none of them dissatisfied us. The only problem is that there may not be that enough time for a big group to taste more because there is a 2-hour limit. In all, feel free to order, each single dish is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I LOVE EVERYTHING AT THIS PLACE and IT IS WORTH THE WAIT . . . much better than their affiliated restaurants!  Note: It's pretty loud in there, so small groups would be good if you want to talk and hear one another"}
{"text":"WAY too loud for my tastes but enjoyed all the food I tried and service was good.  THey could make more money if they upgraded their sake list.  Chairs could also be more comfortable."}
{"text":"I first came to Kinka when it first opened as Guu and when this Church street location was pretty much one of the first Izakaya pubs in Toronto. This was years ago and we had waited in line outside in the middle of the freezing winter for a couple of hours to get into this place. Also with the caveat, \"at the time\", we were all completely new to the Izakaya experience which I have since learned is pretty popular in Japan. Luckily, back in those days, we were not disappointed by our wait and the experience was completely worth it!  Even more lucky for you, Izakaya has become more popular in Toronto and you have enough venues to pick from that you will rarely have to wait long to be seated, if at all.   Kinka is great; the food is great, the overly energetic screaming servers and food prep staff are great, the whole experience is pretty cool. If you're looking for a fun night out on a date or with a few friends, you would like to grab a drink or two and have a few unique tapas style Japanese dishes that are NOT sushi, then Kinka is a great option.  I need to stress that you will not find Sushi at most Izakaya places. Izakaya is more about drinks and unique small tapas style dishes that you have alone or share with friends.  The environment is fairly loud is while I have gone on dates at places like these in the past, they may not be the best if you are hoping for a lot of deep conversation. On the flip side, some people who aren't super comfortable on first or second dates may find the loud din of the environment helpful in filling in a few of the silent gaps that may creep into such a date.   Their other location on Bloor near Bathurst which I believe is still called Guu, for the time being, is just as good and basically an interchangeable experience.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My friends and I had an excellent time. There weren't many people so it wasn't very loud (and I know it can be when it's crowded) I had a takowasabi, which was excellent (very very strong) but only had 3 bites worth for about 5 bucks. I had 2 orders of the baked oysters because it was just so good! The yakiudon was good but not as impressive.  Quality: 8.5/10. Service: 8.5/10. Value: 8/10. Overall: 8.5/10 (not an average)"}
{"text":"I traveled to Toronto October of 2016 (late review because Yelp likes to hide places in my bucket to review and bring them back when I run low. I travel often so it gets lost when I don't review them right away) I came in for lunch and sat at the bar by myself. Service was quick and friendly. I mingled with others sitting nearby so the atmosphere was very nice. I had jellyfish to start with. Texture was quite unique, I was feeling adventurous so I decided to give it a try. It was gelatinous in taste. For entree I had one of the fish dishes and it was yum!!! This place was memorable for me because I tried Japanese nato. I do not recommend that for anybody. It was definitely an acquire taste but not like sushi. It was disgusting fishy, sticky, slimy, and fermented taste. Its hard to describe it but don't get it, they will warn you when you order. Again, I'm adventurous so I tried it. Good experience, I'm glad I tested my palette."}
{"text":"What Tapas is to Spain, Dim Sum is to Chinese. Guu is to Japanese.   At first, it might be a little hidden to the naked *tourist* eye but once you find it and open those large heavy doors. You'll be hit in the face with a ton of Asians shouting incoherent Japanese greetings.   PROTIP: Give yourself a good half hour wait. Come popularity, come longer wait times. Part of the trade-off, I suppose.  The atmosphere is open, with lots of chatter and big heavy, school-lunch style tables. For those more claustrophobic, you might want to reconsider your dinner options for, at Guu, you might potentially share tables with other guests. Otherwise, get close, cheer to a beer and have fun with your friends!  This is the perfect place for large groups, birthdays and perhaps even a fun date. Stay clear if you're going for romantic and quiet.  Believe the hype, this place is unique, fun and wild and the food is DELICIOUS. So delicious in fact that you can taste the authenticity. We sampled a variety of items off the menu, some more \"crazier\" than others but all in all it was a good experience and can't wait to go back. My mouth is just watering from thinking about it. mmmmm.  PS. don't be frightened as they yell at you on your way out, they're just saying goodbye! :)"}
{"text":"Kinka was so much fun! The atmosphere was so energetic, and the staff was always ready to yell a welcome or hype everyone up for a sake bomb. We came for our friend's birthday and ordered the seven samurai shooters; the whole staff sang her happy birthday and gave her a Polaroid picture to take home. The staff was very attentive and the atmosphere makes me want to go again!"}
{"text":"This will truly be an unique restaurant experience! This place is formerly called Guu and I always wanted to go here because of their atmosphere  and delicious eats.  I highly recommend making reservations because this place gets extremely busy. I made reservations for a group of 4 through Yelp which turned out well. As soon as you walk into the store you will be greeted in a really loud, and enthusiastic voice from the staff. At first, I was quite embarrassed because I felt that everyone was looking at me, but this is the complete norm.   I highly recommend ordering from the Party Menu. I felt that the portions of the food was perfect and you get to try out their most popular dishes. We ordered the A Course.  My favourite dishes from the menu were the Brie Cheese, Karaage, and the Kinoko Bibimbap. The fact that you can try out 8 dishes for $20 + tax/person is a steal.   I think this place will be great to come for your birthday as well! They sing you a birthday song and everyone around you clap as well :)"}
{"text":"This place is so live!! Great atmosphere, very enthusiastic staff with wide range of menu options, a daily menu and a regular menu.   Bibimpap rice was my favourite, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place to gather with friends and families. A bit noisy but its part of the Japanese culture you get to experience. Food was average. Price is average-high. Recommend their bibimbap, Karaage and sake bomb. Service was amazing, they are helpful and kind."}
{"text":"GUU-dness gracious!!!! We made a reservation month's in advance all the way from Hawaii thinking we were going to have a GUU-reat time at this so called number one Izakaya in all of Toronto. Well let me tell you something about our dining experience here at GUU Izakaya. It was far from GUU-d if you ask me. And let me tell you about my hearing after eating at this noisy, i mean very noisy place that they call a restaurant here. I felt like all the servers and cooks here were high on acid or just had too many sake shots before their shift started.   These workers were yelling at the top of their lungs each and every time someone walked through that door. And where do you think they sat me. my wife, and my niece at???? Right by the door and packed like a can of sardines i might add. So much for coming all the way from Hawaii and having a wonderful dinner here on our first night here in Toronto. I think i would rather hear planes flying over us than here these loud people that work here at Guu!!!!   If i had known how noisy this place was, then i would have brought my earplugs with us or have one of the chef's just slice both my ears off to drown out the noise level here at GUU. One thing that really turned me off about this place from the start was having our hostess tell us that there is a two hour dining time here. Ok fine, no problem. But if we have a seven o clock reservation and they give us a check at 8:10 without us even asking for it, what the hell are you rushing us out for? Not only did they seat us the most undesirable table in the whole damn restaurant and then they have the nerve to rush us out in just a little over an hour when they quoted us a two hour dining session is just plain wrong especially after flying for over ten hours flying from Honolulu and then stopping over in Vancouver and then finally landing in Toronto then having choose this place for our first meal in Toronto. Very Very disappointed.   I guess i was blinded by all these glowing reviews on Yelp and i got suckered into coming to this place although i was a bit skeptical but i gave in to my Japanese wife who is usually spot on about places like this. Although the menu here is quite extensive and cheap, the Izakaya's here in Hawaii would blow these places right out of the water and back to Japan because the food and quality at this Izakaya doesn't even come close to the mediocre Izakaya's here in Hawaii. Another red flag about this place was that there were no Japanese eating here and that usually is a tell tale sign that this place was a bad choice from the beginning. They usually say cheap is good but the food here at GUU wasn't GUU-D AT ALL!!!!    The service here was very puzzling if you ask me. The servers here look like a bunch of mice looking for pieces of cheese all over the floor. You didn't even know who your server was because they were too busy screaming out food orders or were just in a trance. Monster drinks would have no effect on the people that work here. it was like watching a game of Hungry Hippo's from our table. They must really love their jobs here and to get a job here you must have to scream at the top of your lungs at the interviewer and they will hire you by the decibal's coming out of your mouth.   If not for the saving graces of dining at Zakkushi on Carlton and Sushi Bar Sushiya in Toronto, the Japanese fare here in Toronto would have been a major disappointment for us. I truly loved the vibe at Zakkushi and the service there was far more stellar than here at Guu. And we could actually carry a conversation there as well as opposed to doing sign language while eating at GUU. I'm gonna give you all a fair warning about dining here at GUU. It's gonna be the loudest dining experience you are ever going to experience and you will think that a sold out Raptor game or Blue jay's game or Maple Leaf's game has nothing on the noise level here at GUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Lovely trendy restaurant! I just love it. The taste of food  has a fine dinning touch to it that is not easy to find. I guess this is when you say there is the wow factor in this restaurant."}
{"text":"I chose to eat here during a weekend trip to downtown with my family based on the number of yelp reviews. I  had high expectations it having 900+ reviews and a high rating. Sorry yelpers but I don't get what the fuss is all about. It wasn't bad, don't get me wrong. But it wasn't memorable either. The oysters were good but not mind blowing. The karaage was okay as well. My son said 'did we go all the way to downtown for this?'. In summary, it was just okay."}
{"text":"Food was OK, Service was extremely slow. The vibe however was fun and the music was good! It is a fun atmosphere for birthdays and big groups, however the service needs improvement. I think I waited maybe 45 mins to an hour for a small spare ribs dish."}

{"text":"Love the food and the energy ! Can get a bit loud but that's great when you are in the mood :)"}
{"text":"Made a reservation a few days ahead for a small family dinner. I was seated at a the end of a long communal looking table (like classy picnic tables) and boy was that tragic. Every single time someone walked in or left, every single employee screamed...with gusto. It was totally bizarre and though me and my younger siblings laughed and enjoyed it, it kind of lost its charm 20 min into the dinner. My parents couldn't stand the noise levels and I saw a little girl plugging her ears the whole night so I'd avoid bringing your parents or children. The food was okay, nothing spectacular, I'd recommend the cod and prawns, they were fantastic. The udon was good, but I found the bimbimbap missing flavours (as a regular Korean food enthusiast). We ordered more but it wasn't quite memorable. To be honest I expected more from such a popular spot. The prices were reasonable and the service was really great. overall I found it subpar and I most likely won't be returning. Tip: make a reservation, walk ins had to wait 40+ min"}
{"text":"I wanted to try the Unagi rice today as I saw the really great reviews and photos about this restaurant.  Super disappointed, when I opened my light-weighted take out box the extremely tiny little servings of the rice awfully surprised me. I didn't expect to have a this small dinner.  Despite the not so pleasant appearance of the dish, the food is average. I did like the sticky texture of the rice with cheese. There were just two or three pieces of small Unagi.  I think I would recommend people rather go to the restaurant to have meals. I think the mood of the restaurant (bar style?) would satisfy some of us. Also, I would say the restaurant expected us to order a lot of food and that's why they are in such a \"really small\" plate.   That would be great if only my Unagi rice was placed in a smaller container or box, so that it would be appeared as appetizing and more delicious to me in my opinion.  (I have also taken some photos of my take out boxes to show the servings (to me they are small servings sadly) )"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere on the patio, inside can get really loud from all the cheering. Had the sushi salad and pitcher of beer. Great place to hangout"}
{"text":"DO NOT come here if you want to talk.  DO NOT come here if you don't like loud noises.  DO NOT come here if you're easily startled.  Mentally prepare yourself.  You can't complete a sentence without a waiter yelling at the top of their lungs as they walk by you. They yell when someone enters the restaurant. They yell when someone leaves. They yell when food is present. They yell when air is breathed. They yell when life exists. It was just too much.  I would steer clear unless you're in the mood for something boisterous. Otherwise, you will find the experience jarring.   Having since been to the different Guu locations a few times, I now know what to expect and while it's still not ideal, it's bearable.   I enjoyed the food though. The karaage fried chicken, ikapiri fried calamari with wasabi mayo, and kinoko bibimbap with cheese were my favourites."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Kinka Izakaya Original on 8/18/17.  We made reservations after reading the great reviews.  We completely agree that this is a wonderful spot!  Food was great (a special shout out for the baked oysters) and drinks were enjoyable too (saki and a cocktail called blue- something).  Service was great.  It's a very fun and friendly place.  We even got a special (and loud) greeting from the whole place when we arrived ... and an equally enthusiastic send off when leaving after our meal.  We highly recommend Kinka Izakaya Original!  P.S.  Feel comfortable wearing casual clothing ... it's a pretty casual setting."}
{"text":"Japanese tapas with some interesting fusion. I had been here before  in the past when it was Guu had a good time. This time I had the carbonara with udon for lunch. It was pretty empty actually with only a couple other tables so the service was excellent. Hubby had the salmon don and it was really good. Large portions of fresh chunks of sushi salmon paired with sushi rice and a really delicious sauce on top. Everyone in our group agreed the salmon don was great value. (Comes with miso soup and salad) They have an extensive sake menu and lots of different tapas to try, it's a great lounge spot and hearing the kitchen yelling in Japanese to greet you is lots of fun. :)"}
{"text":"mmm... Izakaya awesomeness.  I went there on three separate nights, and getting seated at the bar was never a problem. Most parties of two or more seemed to have decent wait times.  Every dish I had was solid. The Gindara (black cod) is umami heaven and simply stunning. The fried spicy calamari was a welcome update to plain old fried squid, and would surely convert squid hating heathens. My other favorites were the takowasabi octopus and the kimchi udon w/ spicy cod roe. When it comes to mayo, I say \"bring it on\", but I imagine many finding the okonomiyaki's mustard mayo to be overwhelming.   The service was mixed depending on the night I went. On my first night, I was ignored for a long time and it took forever to get my check. On the other nights they were very attentive. The place is definitely loud, and when you exit the restaurant, the entire staff greets you farewell. That's true even if you try to sneak out (yes I tried ...)"}
{"text":"I am not a great fan of Japanese food but this place made me change my.  I was tricked by my friend (who told me calamari was chicken). After eating about 3 serving (their small serving at this location) I was finally told it was actually octopus. What a surprise!!   The best thing about this place is the staffs energy. You walk in to a wonderful greeting by the staff ( they literacy yell at you ) and seat at this cottage like table.  The only down fall is the small portion and high prices.  We went and choice to go somewhere else to fill our tummies. However, if your just looking for a different kind of restaurant experience this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"I give them three stars because the food is good tasting but the service is lacking. They did not fulfill our order correctly after asking several times and the menu was confusing and did not offer good options. Though the food is flavoured nicely."}
{"text":"Wait, how does such a cute quirky store even exist??   Guu was such a fun experience! Finding the front door was half the challenge. The entrance was a nondescript unmarked door on the side of a building that if it weren't for the huge line outside waiting to get in for dinner at 5, I would have missed. (Ok, I was eager and arrived way before 5 and definitely missed it.)  The host let parties in one by one and when it came time for you to walk in, you were greeted by all the employees in the restaurant shouting \"Welcome!\" in Japanese, a warm embrace from the open kitchen area, delicious scents of food being prepared, and pumped up J-Pop in the background. The energy level of the workers were off the wall!  I came here once by myself and sat at the bar and another time with my boyfriend and sat near the patio. If you get a chance, I definitely recommend the bar seat so you can watch the chefs immaculately assemble their culinary creations (or drool at the dishes being made and whisked past you so you can make a mental note to order it next time.)  The style of eating here is Japanese tapas so expect to order several small plates to fill you up. This will be a combined review of both of my visits:  Kurage - This marinated jellyfish dish will have you drooling for seconds. Perfectly seasoned, the chilled tendrils will slide right down. 5/5  Seaweed and Tofu Salad - This was a combination of dried, purple, and green seaweed sitting on top of a bed of a generic salad. I loved the refreshing seaweed-tofu combination but wished there was more of that and less of the typical greens beneath. 3/5  Salmon Natto Yukke - Coming from an avid natto lover, this was definitely a win in my books. They did an interesting spin on natto and mixed it with salmon sashimi, egg yolk, and an assortment of other misc ingredients so that it ended up being a goopy, sticky concoction that was served with squares of seaweed to wrap it in. Even if you normally do not like natto, this was mixed enough that it covers the usual distinct taste of it. 5/5  Kabocha Korokke - I love pumpkin! I love egg! And this dish is a combination of the two! This interesting order comes in a round ball shape and is essentially a pumpkin cooked around an egg. It also comes with a fun wooden knife sticking out of the top. The sauce was a little strong, but if mixed with the inside, still tastes very good. 5/5  Takoyaki - Standard Japanese octopus balls. BEWARE OF HOT INSIDES. The first time I ordered it, I impatiently popped it into my mouth minutes after it arrived on my table and almost spewed a fireball back out at the unfortunate patron sitting next to me at the bar. Lesson learned, and I waited the second visit. The takoyaki is well made but the sauce is too strong. Is it strange I like to watch the bonito flakes dancing around from the heat? 4/5  Gindara - The most expensive dish you can order on the tapas menu but well worth it. Deliciously grilled black cod. A definite recommend for every visit! 5/5  Unagi Doria - Eel over mushroom rice with a layer of melted cheese to top it off. This actually sounds a lot more scrumptious than it actually tastes. Still good, but not as good as I was hoping for. Could be attributed to the fact that my stomach was starting to run out of space by this point. 4/5  Almond Tofu - This was creamy and silky and sweet and delicious and WAY TOO SMALL. Please create bigger cups of this as I could have easily downed 5 more. 5/5  Also tried Ramune, a type of Japanese soda, for the first time and was pleasantly surprised by it."}

{"text":"Guu runs as right as a Tokyo train.  If you ever, in life, learn to miss the atmosphere of Tokyo or Osaka, Guu will take you back.  It is a holodeck of atmospheric amazingness that transports you because of the amazing service and energy of its staff.  How many restaurants can claim that without being underwritten by Hollywood or big fake plastic doodads?    There is a legitimate, infectious cheer in every Guu I've been too.  The whole staff belts out your arrival and departure like therapy that should exist.  Yes, it's all business and no, everybody doesn't know your name.  But it is 100% world-class Japanese hospitality right here in T.O.!  Irrashaii lucky b!#ches!  There are an awful lot of deep fried tapas-style offerings if you're not careful to ask (or uh, look at the pictures), but who cares?  You're gonna get fat anyway.  Food is yum, well-presented, comes fast, great portions and is affordable.  Asahi Black is always my drink of choice, but am easily sidetracked by the sake-cocktail menu.  We were a-holes and out-sat a bit past our 2-hour seating limit.  But the gentle Japanese staff kept filling our water, no match for our our passive-agressiveness.  They should take a page from the Mandarin Buffet, tho.  They deserve the turnover!"}
{"text":"Can't get much friendlier environment than this! It's hard to stay so energized all night, but the staff at Guo did it!"}
{"text":"Fun, lively Izakaya with great sharing dishes and selection of alcohol. The staff are rambunctious and friendly, greeting everyone with a booming \"????????\" making you feel immediately welcomed. Atmosphere of a modern Japanese pub/tavern, great for groups. They also have outdoor seating during the summer which is much quieter if you want to talk. Lots of interesting dishes and can't really say much more than pick what you think sounds good and you'll be pleasantly surprised. Only complaint is portion sizes can be a bit small for the price you pay, and service can be hard to flag down as it's crazy busy and loud, but definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Gyu carpaccio, the salmon tataki and the baked oysters. The oysters were very good and flavourful, however the carpaccio was just ok and a bit chewy as if it was a cheap cut. The salmon tataki was a bit too mushy for our taste. Overall a bit expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"A fun (and VERY LOUD) place for a Japanese small-plate meal.  We tried their \"Karabi\" (= Kalbi = Korean BBQ ribs), Bibimbop, shrimp tempura, squid, tofu dish and yaki udon.  Decent food at fair price - my teenage kids had a great time."}
{"text":"A-MAZING. ive never been to japan but I assume this is as authentic as it gets. the place is super loud and super busy but its fun! its tapas style so u get to try a bit of everything. 2 dishes i have had here are absolutely FANTASTIC.  -gindara (grilled black cod) is melt in your mouth HEAVEN.  if you have never had black cod before you have to come here and try it. the MOST mouthwatering piece of fish ever! -kinoko bibimbap (rice with mushrooms and cheese). I know this might sound kind of gross but it is farrrrr from that. comes out steaming hot in a stone bowl and you mix it all together for a mouthful of paradise. Im such a BIG fan of this.  I will refuse to share and have to get my own bowl.   probably the best japanese food you can get in toronto!"}
{"text":"A little bit loud for my taste but the food was great, be prepared to (maybe) sit communally!"}
{"text":"What is this Guu craze all about??? First off i feel cheated by some of the fellow yelpers.  Awesome food?? Really??? japanese dishes with mayo and lots of it too. Mayo with about everything, even sashimi.  I understand fuzion or try to be different, but not All mayo.  I don't really care about service personally and if you do, then Guu is not the place either.  It's mainly the language barrier, which i do understand, but from my end I have questions and concerns too. What sake would you recommend? What's the diff? then all i get is yes, this, good. A little more information would definitly be helpful.  Maybe I'm just picky or maybe people just like to eat in noisy environments. I just don't understand"}
{"text":"Quick update to my review...  I came back with two friends during the summertime and had a BLAST again. This time, I sat at the bar right in front of the chefs who were quite amusing to watch.  Note to all -- GO ON YOUR BIRTHDAY! It is amazing to see these chefs and waitstaff whip out silly glasses, do a silly dance, and sing you an original happy birthday song. They have so much energy. I can't do the explanation justice.  The waitstaff and chefs also shout a LOT, so be prepared for the loudness. However, listening to their amusing little side songs and comments in Japanese made for a very fun evening. We loved our experience there!  The food was good and filling. One surprising tasty dish was the gomaae, spinach with sesame sauce. So delicious! The deep fried pumpkin with egg inside was prepared interestingly and it was very satisfying to eat. My friends loved the ramen... they said the pork was done perfectly! I had some of the broth and that was pretty tasty.  Saba and oden are always great staples here too.  I heart this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great atmosphere. Tuna tataki was amazing. Had to order more food as everything was delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great, energetic ambience. Friendly staff, great customer service. Here are my recommendations (I forgot the names but these are the descriptions :$):  - stuffed clams - baked pumpkin with egg (love!!!) - almond dessert  - karaage  I love the frozen grapes you get when you pay. I don't think they always serve them but when they do - I'm happy! Who knew frozen grapes would be so delicious?!"}
{"text":"They were able to find a space for me at the bar (dining alone while away on business!) and it was fun to watch the exuberant cooks cheering and yelling in Japanese as they whipped up concoctions!  The energy is fun and happy (and LOUD)! You can't be in a bad mood here!  Had the salmon natto - my first experience with natto and while the foaming slimy dish wasn't the prettiest (especially after it's been mixed), I really enjoyed it. Also loved the uni special (SOOOO FRESH!), beef carpaccio, and the fried chicken appetizer. Left stuffed with a giant smile!  Will definitely be back, wish it was in NY!"}
{"text":"What an experience! Food was amazing, atmosphere was even more amazing. Brings a smile to my face just thinking about it. Highly recommend the Fried Brie, it's frikken brilliant among many other very unique dishes. Kids killed the Yaki Udon, wish we had gotten two plates now. Can't wait to come back, drooling just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Fun environment, great service and good food. Can't go wrong. Best for groups. They yell and acknowledge everyone who comes and goes, its catchy and everyone will join in. They have a menu or a choice of two pre set menu's."}
{"text":"A Japanese izakaya featuring classic Japanese pub fare. The atmosphere is always lively and if you sit by the bar, you can see the chefs at work.  I recommend sitting on the patio if you want to have a more intimate and quiet chat with your friends.   You can order a few dishes to share, or pick one of their 'set menus' for parties of two or more - which is a good option if you want to try a few dishes.  Some of the items we had were: - Okonimiyaki -- yum! - Jelly Fish - a good cold side-dish - Karaage -- juicy and crunchy at the same time  - Beef Udon -- decent  - Baked Oysters with a mushroom and cream sauce -- these are to die for!  - Salmon Tataki -- Very fresh and citrus - Sashimi Salad -- Fresh with a citrus dressing   I recommend getting a reservation before going because this place does get busy - especially if you are in a large group.  The service was good, although it is hard to judge on this one time because I was outside on the patio and didn't get much attention (had to grab my own menus). I did come here for a bachelorette party once and the service was amazing for our 20+ party."}
{"text":"This place was a riot! Super lively ambience, great food at decent prices, and the service is fantastic. Brought a group of friends and we got properly wrecked on sake bombs (which our server did with us)."}
{"text":"Amazing! Few restaurants have me smiling from the moment I walk in to well after I've left.  We sat at the bar and started talking to one of the cooks(turns out he is the sous chef). Asked him what he makes best and that started an unforgettable dining experience. We had their version of a mackerel ceviche that was on special. Big eye tuna sashimi, that had amazing texture and was incredibly fresh. Followed be enoki hottate bacon. The reality is my guest and I ate too many items to list, all of which will leave me awake at night wondering when I'll get to eat them again. My recommendation is this though, sit at the bar, ask the cooks and trust them! Don't forget to buy them a shot or two. Kampai!"}
{"text":"Little too noisy for a date, but good food! the bake oyster is to die for! Drinks are fine but not stunning, the 35$$ per person tasting menu is just perfect, but a little bit too much food, 29 would be good too!"}
{"text":"When people say it's lively...it is certainly lively. Staff will find any reason to yell and make noise, whether it's a customer entering or leaving, or a dish comes out of the kitchen, or anything else. Definitely the kind of atmosphere that encourages you to raise your own voices.  If you're not a fan of the volume, fortunately they also have a patio that is much quieter. During colder seasons, it would be covered up and adequately heated, so the option is available year-round as long as they choose to offer it.  We came for some mega karaage. I don't know if it's on the regular menu, but they make some pretty good fried chicken. Super crisp skin, nice juicy meat. They have a waiter checking up on the patio frequently enough, with water refills and asking how things are doing.  I don't know how the regular items are like, but if they've got karaage normally I'd come back for more."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: It was really lively here (some might call it loud in the inside of the restaurant)! They greet you as you walk in the door, respond to each other loudly when an order is put through, and also as you walk out. It's definitely an experience!  Highlights: The Gindara (Black Cod) with miso and white wine sauce was TO DIE FOR. The fish was perfectly moist and buttery, and the sauce complimented it really well - we were mopping up every last drop. We went on a Sunday, and one of the specials of the day was the Seared Yellowfin Tuna (they called it Yellow Tail for some reason???). It was lightly seared and seemed to be marinated in a light citrus sauce - yum :)  Alrights: The Kakimayo (Baked Oyster with Garlic Mayo, Cheese, Mushroom, and Spinach) was alright. The sauce was really savoury, but it wasn't anything that you couldn't make at home. Although it's served on the half-shell, the shell is merely a decorative piece - you can tell that they didn't shuck the oysters themselves since they were not attached to the shell and also because we saw the chefs pull shells from a shell to put prepare the food inside (the lobster dishes also are not plated with the shell that the seafood came from....if it was purchased with a shell :S) The infamous Gyu Carpaccio.....ehhhh, it was alright. Pretty standard compared to other places that serve this dish. It didn't knock my socks off, but it was pretty good.  Lowlights: The Fried Brie Cheese. I honestly don't understand what the hype is around this - the cheese itself doesn't have that much flavour and the Mango and Berry sauces it comes with just taste strange paired with the cheese. If acidity was needed to cut though the richness of the cheese, I would have much preferred the use of some type of vinegar, perhaps balsamic/rice wine vinegar? I also find it a little strange that the waiting area is outside of the restaurant - when the weather is nice, it's understandable, but it must be HORRIBLE when the weather is bad. I can see why they would do it (because the restaurant is so small) but there must be a better alternative....  Overall Notes: It was nice to come and try the infamous Guu experience once, but I'm not frothing at the mouth to come back again. Maybe if the dishes were bigger for the price. One star deducted because only some, rather than all of the dishes, were hits. Another star deducted for the lack of bang-for-buck factor - each dish is pretty small and pretty expensive."}
{"text":"IRASHAIMASEN!!!!!  As you walk through those doors, you will be loudly and greeted by a very enthusiastic staff making you feel like a total VIP :). That was really necessary, because just the wait to get in was a monster...   Seating is fairly cramped, and given that I had a bag, a giant winter coat, scarf, hat, and gloves, it was hard to fit it all in the little space that our party of 4 was cramped into. Service was stellar.  Food, overall impression was expensive, small portion sizes, and okay at best.   Takowasabi - marinated octupus. Yummy, but really small portion. :( Each of the four of us only got a small LICK of it. Okonomiyaki - Japanese seafood pancake. LOVE this stuff. :)  Amberjack sashimi - good... but I could probably get fresh sashimi grade fish for quite cheap in san diego. Gyu Carpaccio - beef sashimi. This was really different! Kakimayo - baked oyster with tones of cheese. I prefer to eat oysters raw but this was very tasty.  Unagi Doria - Eel fried rice. I make this stuff at home, so this was not something I would have personally picked (especially given the price).  Salmon Natto Yukke - raw egg and a bunch of stuff. I got nauseous watching our server mix the raw egg and the sashimi into a vomit-like concoction.  Tofu cheesecake - this was yummy! but I'll probably just try to make it on my own in the future XD  Food alone was not impressive but it is definitely a fun place to go for the atmosphere. BUT if you're not the type to like shouting across the table to have a conversation with your buddies, I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"We were there on a Saturday and it was very busy. It's a good place if you want to enjoy a cheerful Japanese pub atmosphere. But since this place is very noisy I wouldn't recommend it for a romantic dinner.  We tried quite a few of their dishes (10 or so) and weren't disappointed. The only thing I did not like too much was the spicy fried calamari or squid rings that were drowned in a spicy sauce which softened the crispy batter very quickly and turned it into a soggy something (just don't let it sit on the table for too long). The three different and expensive sakes we tried seemed to be decent although I am not a sake expert.  Overall an interesting and fun BUT pricy experience."}
{"text":"I love this place. One of the best non-sushi Japanese food places and brilliant cocktails. Not cheap, but good, service and atmosphere are very great and interesting."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the authentic experience. I know I cannot get the same Wine I would get in Paris, the same pizza and coffee I would get in Rome or the same pickled seafood tapas I would get in Sevilla. But at least I like to try places that try to get most of it right.    I had heard about Guu  Izakaya for a while now and although I had a few chances to go before, I wanted to make sure I went with a friend who had actually lived in Japan so he could tell me if it was authentic or not (as I have not lived in Japan)... in the end I went with two.   Now as far as my experience, I have to say that I really enjoyed it. The vibe is great, it reminds me of those busy restaurants in Chinatown or in a small town in Spain where everyone just chats about their day in a group setting. Basically, it feels like 'People are really sharing a meal\" and you are part of it. The staff shouting greetings to those coming in and \"good bye's\" to those who leave feels completely natural. It really feels like the room comes alive.   My friends who had lived in Tokyo for two years really had a blast as it reminded them a bit of living in Japan, however brief that vibe was.   The food is delicious, although I can see why I lot of Canadians might not like it. I had plenty of squid, raw salmon, fried pig stomach, spicy beef, deep friend chicken, all made with a delicious tangy-ness that I have come to recognize as Japanese food.   I know that it is not full-fledge 100% authentic Japanese but I am happy to know that it is as close an Izakaya-experience as you can get in Toronto.    Word to the wise --  as it has been mentioned, this place gets crazy packed. All the time. We knew it ahead of time but we literally came, dropped our names, went to a nearby bar, chatted, ordered a tiny snack, had a drink or two and waited for about an hour and change and by the time we got back, it took five minutes for our table to be ready...On a Sunday. Yet all in all, it was worth it. Especially since ti was the first time. I hope that now with the new Bloor location that wait times decrease.   Also, it can get pricey, for a meal for four, it came to about $172+tax.  Which is a bit when you consider that you are purchasing small Japanese tapas and not full fledge dinners. Although in their defense, if you want to get authentic food from across the world, in Canada, made as they make it, then yes, expect to pay for it. And we were oh, so full and satisfied! I will go again.     Not like Torito Tapas Bar (Yes, that is right, I am unplugging a place) where you spend $132+tax for four people and not only they are not really authentic tapas (they are cheaper versions of them, which is remarkable to say as tapas is really a peasant food) but we stopped ordering as they were so tiny that we were just throwing money away for the small portions. We literally left that restaurant hungry only to make a bee line to another nearby restaurant to actually eat. Thankfully, Guu is not like that."}
{"text":"Guu was the most upscale of Japanese restaurants I visited during my short visit to Toronto. I did go for late afternoon lunch on a weekday so it wasn't loud at all and the energy of the kitchen staff and servers was warm and welcoming. The hamburger steak was the best I had. It was thick, nicely textured, juicy, and bathing in a succulent tomato-based sauce. I'm sure it would be top class it was a hamburger. With the \"tapas/small plates\" label in mind, I thought the portion was very generous. Total $14.46 tax included."}
{"text":"Expensive!  This place doesn't stack up to the Guu in Vancouver. The food was decent, but portions are way too small. I ate with another friend of mine (female) and for both of us to be full, we had to spend almost 60 dollars. Far too expensive for food that is nothing too special.   The atmosphere was fun, but way too noisy. I like how they keep it entertaining, but it is not a good place to sit and chat. It is difficult to hear the person sitting directly across from you with so much background noise.  The waiter was helpful and attentive, but service was slow. It took almost 10 minutes to get our bill. We had to wait for a long time for the first dish to come to us. Given that they are small portions, we ate it very quickly.  In general, for every good thing I find about this place, there is always something bad also about this place. So would I recommend it? Yeah preferably to someone who have a small stomach and just want to enjoy the atmosphere.  Guu in Vancouver is definitely better than in Toronto."}
{"text":"I came here recently for a friend's birthday. It's been a long time since I came to this location, and the place is as lively as I remembered. So make sure to make a reservation, or else you will most likely not have a seat! Also, be aware that the seating has a 2 hour limit. For those not familiar with the Kinka atmosphere, it is super loud inside the restaurant. So if you are looking for an intimate place for a date, this isn't the place you. Otherwise, this is a super fun place to hang with friends!  Food is just as good as I remembered, and same as the other locations. My favorite dish at Kinka that I highly recommend is the Kabocha Korokke, it's a deep fried pumpkin with an boiled egg inside, and topped with a special sauce. I know it might not sound amazing, but it's soooo yummy, and I'm so glad that my friend ordered it the first time I went to a Kinka, as I've always gotten it since. Other dishes that I always order are the Brie Cheese, Yaki Udon and Kimchi Bibimbap.  They also have a very unique and good drink menu. I really enjoy the Bamboo, it's very light and refreshing. It's also very fun getting the sake bomb, as they get all the staff in the restaurant to cheer, and you bang on the table to get the shot to fall into the cup. Super fun!  The reason I gave this review 3 stars is because service was super slow. It felt like we were waiting a long time between each dish. Each dish is pretty small, so when it got to the table, the 6 of us finished it pretty fast, then had to wait a long time for the next dish to come. Given that there's a 2 hour limit, it seemed a bit ridiculous that the kitchen was so slow."}
{"text":"There is not much I can add to what's already been said, food is fabulous (my top fav is ebi sashimi and gindara grilled black cod), service is energetic and friendly, frequent bursts of welcome shout-outs from every staff member make this a fun space.    This place is always busy, come a few minutes before the door opens or come late at night to avoid waiting lines."}
{"text":"I tried the one in Vancouver previously, so I was excited to see that there was one in Toronto. If you're walking along Church street it's easy to walk by since there's a lot between the entrance and the street. I was a little disappointed to see that they only served a limited menu for brunch, but left both surprised and happy.  Not sure if they do this all the time, but they had a grill set up on the patio where they were BBQ-ing. We ended up ordering the seaweed salad, pork yaki soba, BBQ calamari, and the chicken wings. Everything was great, but the highlight for me was the chicken wings. I don't normally like wings, and I never like skin, but I loved them. They were fried wings with a teriyaki sauce, and I was literally sucking on the bones. I was a little surprised when they served up the calamari which was literally a BBQ-ed squid completely in tact sitting on my plate, but it was well cooked and a great price.   I had only ever eaten dinner at the one in Vancouver which was always accompanied by a long wait, but this place was pretty empty for brunch. Loved that they had a patio too. This is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Canada. We need one in America! Too many sushi places, not enough Japanese tapas."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I could go on and on about how tasty and high quality everything was.  I went with my boyfriend and we sat at the bar, right where the food was put to be brought to other guests. It was amazing because we got to see and smell all of that food, even though we didn't have room in our stomachs for it.  It was super loud which I love and the servers were very friendly; I really can think of only good things to say. We got miso, spinach, carpaccio, salmon tataki, the ketchup calamari, and deep fried brie. I would recommend everything I got. The brie was to DIE for, it made me think that even if someone doesnt like japanese food, (why?) they would love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Soooo loud but soooo gooood! Their deep fried Brie is to die for! Love this place and will come back soon!"}
{"text":"So much fun and the food is absolutely heavenly. This is the place you bring your friends to show them what Toronto is really about. #wherethelocalseat"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is VERY loud but you can't help but love the energy of this place... the staff are very friendly and attentive too! The dishes are authentic Japanese with a twist, and the one's I've tried have been good.    My only complaints about this place however are the pricing, as the tapas dishes can rack up the bill real quick, and the wait times you'll experience if you don't line up before opening.  But what can I say? Overall, this place is pretty (excuse the pun) guu'd!"}
{"text":"This place is just SO much fun.  Really great food and drinks.  Can get pricey depending on what you order, but can also be really cheap if you avoid the raw fish and expensive drinks.  The staff are great, though not the quickest.  If you're hungry, better to order a bunch of things at once.  Blowtorched fish is definitely a highlight.  Amazingly cool drinks."}
{"text":"Just eat here and see what all the commotion is about. Soy marinated chicken with garlic mayo! I could eat this all day!"}
{"text":"Guu is exotic and boisterous but is genuine quality,  Everything is prepared with care, high quality food and distinctive. You may not like every item on the menu, and some will have quite unusual tastes, but it is a gastronomic experience. Native Japanese speakers and Japanese customs give you a true authentic experience of Japan, beyond the cuisine. It is pricey but worth what you pay for. Main caveat is remember this is popular and don't expect to not wait if its a busy time."}
{"text":"This place was just as great as I expected.   The atmosphere is a bit noisy, especially with the staff cheering things loudly in Japanese every once in a bit. It was a lot more informal than expected, which I really loved, and the service was impeccable. I knocked over a drink glass and it was cleaned up within 20 seconds. Literally. And not the way that some people say \"literally\" where they actually want to say \"figuratively\". Seriously, 20 seconds. Also, when you sit down, they give you a hot towel. It's like flying first class, except you're not actually going anywhere (although it feels like you're in another world)  On to the food:  The best was the sashimi tuna. It was almost indescribably delicious. Actually, the words that popped out of my mouth after I ate it was \"this tastes like the best steak I ever ate.\" If the steak was tuna. And if it was made of magic.  The other dish that really impressed me was this sort of cold, spicy, black cod stew. I didn't think it was the best use of black cod, because you were mostly tasting the stew, but it tasted amazing, and I will forever be trying to replicate it.  Everything else was really good, as to be expected. I was also surprised at the prices. The four of us had a couple of drinks each and were pretty full (not stuffed), and it cost about $35 per person, after a pretty decent tip.  As we left, the entire staff cheered \"Arigato!\" (the only thing I could understand) and a bunch of other stuff in Japanese to signal our depart.   I will definitely be making a second trip."}
{"text":"Straight up, the employees that work here genuinely love their jobs and that makes me really happy. There's no other way they would be able to survive working here. They're constantly smiling, screaming, cracking jokes with each other, and they do this for hours on end! Let me just bold something: CONSTANTLY SCREAMING (so prepare yourself for that).   Service was amazing and I definitely need to commend them for that, but I also feel obligated to give an honest review of the rest of my experience. The reason why I'm giving this a 3 star rating is because I didn't find the prices reflective of the quality of the food (except for the desserts). Yes, they had pretty good dishes but nothing that was spectacular enough to offset the ridiculous prices. In terms of the dishes that I felt required the most effort and was executed well, I would say the Saba mackerel and matcha creme brulee are worthy of noting. The mackerel had a very tender texture that melted in your mouth and the creme brulee had a creamy consistency with a nicely blow-torched glaze. So yea, I probably wouldn't come back? But it was undoubtedly a nice experience."}
{"text":"I had a lot of fun here some years ago, although I must admit I'm a bit hard of hearing from all the shouting.  This is probably a bit pricier than it should be for the quality, but given the location it's understandable.  The food is modern and fun, great spot to dine with friends or take a date."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! It's LOUD, but it makes for a fun party atmosphere, and would be a great place to start any night on the town.   Love the concept of Japanese tapas, and every single thing we got was very good, and served perfectly. Good cocktails as well!"}
{"text":"great izakaya style restaurant, this is the place that started the loud entrance loud exit type of Japanese restaurants in toronto. although the place tries to present itself as Japanese, this type of service is typically not experienced in Japan. the food is a combination of Korean, japanese, and north American cuisine, which although not authentic, is quite appropriate for the Canadian culture. quality of food and service is quite good, overall recommended."}
{"text":"This place is loud! Really fun too though. You have to be in the right mood to come here I think. It looked like nothing was going on from the outside then open the door and bam! The lighting and color/feel of the place is really warm and nice. The servers and cooks shout at each other all the time and echo back in chorus. We were given warm moist towels when we sat down to wash off with which was nice. Sitting at the bar was kind of cramped although on the plus side we got to watch the cooks. The drinks were very tasty but I don't think very strong at all. The best thing we ate was the Kinoko Bibimbap. Also had the Ebimayo which was pretty good but too much breading. We also had the yakiudon, it is soo hard to eat fat long noodles coated in a cream based sauce with chopsticks."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff and delicious food.  Best place to grab a bite and a few drinks."}
{"text":"Kinka Izakaya was a pleasant surprise. I was not expecting a good izakaya and Japanese tapas restaurant in Toronto, but this place proved me wrong. Kinka Izakaya offers a good variety of drinks, small plates, and some unique dishes. Waits can sometimes take a while because of its popularity, but with the lack of good Japanese food in the area, it's worth it if that's what you're craving."}
{"text":"Was great to spend a wonderful evening here.  The food, atmosphere and service is excellent.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We went there for my daughters birthday. It was so much fun. All the food we've ordered were delicious and very well presented. I'd visit them again for sure."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the highlights of my road trip to Toronto this past weekend. Guu Izakaya is LEGIT. The four of us stopped by around 5:30 on a Saturday and were met with no wait -- just a booming synchronized welcome from all of the staff. Every party that enters gets the same roaring greet so you can just imagine how loud it is in there. I like it though -- it's cheery and fun!   We were pretty hungry so we ordered a bunch of items plus a pitcher of Sapporo. BTW, the pitcher is not worth it! Get two big mugs instead -- cheaper plus more beer.  Amaebi -- My first time having amaebi and I am a total fan! These looked a tad on the smaller side but they were so fresh and sweet.  Gyu Tongue -- These came sizzling hot and were so good! Chewy, seasoned well and perfect with a bite of scallion.  BBQ Pork -- SO GOOD. The pork was ridiculously tender and marinated in a delicious yuzu honey soy sauce. I ate most of this.  Ikapiri (deep fried calimari w/ spicy ketchup & wasabi mayo) -- This was nothing special. The ketchup was too thick and salty and I also didn't taste any hint of wasabi.   Gindara (grilled black cod w/ miso and white wine sauce) -- Excellent. The cod was so flaky and buttery. You must order this.  Yakiudon -- Another winner. So simple but so good and one of the better yakiudons I've had. The udon was perfectly cooked and lightly coated in a creamy gravy. This dish came with mushrooms, scallions and the most tender slices of beef.   Kakimayo -- baked oysters with a mushroom, spinach, garlic mayo mixture and topped w/ cheese -- The oysters were massive! The thick, cheesy mixture on top was just bursting with flavor. I enjoyed every bite of this delicious, creamy mess although honestly, I love everything topped with cheese (except burgers topped with unmelted cold cheese, BLEGH).   We also ordered a grilled sliced octopus dish from the special menu but it wasn't too memorable. The octopus was really fresh but it was coated in a yuzu sauce that was a tad too strong. I've definitely had better.  I didn't find Guu as expensive as everyone says. The prices are pretty much on par with what I normally pay at the izakayas I frequent in NYC (Sake Bar Hagi, Oh! Taisho, Kenka, etc). Overall, solid meal. I will definitely make a return trip here the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Come sin here.  Food is delicious and great for sharing. Such a lively no frills place. The staff greets everyone that enters or leaves. Cool concept and the energy is contagious! They open at 5 and line ups are crazy."}
{"text":"The food is great at a very reasonable price!  I had the blanched spinach with black sesame dressing, which tastes a lot better than it sounds. It was actually one of my favourite dishes of the night. I also had the eggplant deep fried with miso sauce, edamame, guu'd salad, and the tofu and seaweed salad. If you can't tell already, I'm vegetarian haha. My friends ordered the karaage, yakiudon, ebimayo, and okonomiyaki and green tea ice cream. I also had the almond tofu which is a must have!  We finished off the night with drinks (samurai) 3 shots of sake I think it was, which were coloured and flavoured differently. (The green one is the best)   The staff is very friendly, energetic and welcoming.  Arrive early because there are no reservations and you will have to wait a bit in the cold. But it's definitely worth it.   Apologies to the couple next to us who were extremely quiet. My friends and I were pretty loud and were constantly laughing. But really, I think the atmosphere and company is supposed to be that way.  So bring your friends or family or a date that likes a bold setting."}
{"text":"The energy of the place immediately hits you as you walk through the door to screaming Japanese employees brightly greeting you. The kitchen and bar are open and near to the seating area which adds to the intimacy of the environment. The ambience is dominated by loud pulsating music and the sharp shrieks issued upon arrival or departure of guests. Food was overall very good. My girlfriend and I shared 4 dishes and that was enough. We did find that after about an hour of sitting down we were quickly given the cheque and asked to pay. We felt like we were pushed through quickly but that kind of goes with the fast paced atmosphere of the restaurant. Overall, would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The oh so wonderful world of Guu.     I miss guu.  I miss guu more than guu'll ever know.  I'm sorry I had to leave guu back in Vancouver oh so many years ago.   Guu know I had to.  I didn't have a choice.  My life was here out east, in Toronto, I couldn't just get up and leave my life to be with guu.     But for 8 long years, I've thought of guu many times.  I'd dream guu'd come to me.  I miss your sexy oh so unpronounceable cocktails.  Your NANBUBIJIN(SOUTHERN BEAUTY) makes me melt and the \"Oolongh High\" (Oolong Tea+ Vodka) guu give me is unforgettable.   Your taste is also so lovely.  I've never met better pan fried intestines in chives than guu.  I've never found someone who could give me ox tongue in broth like guu gave me before.  I think guu've AGEDASHI (Deep fried Tofu) so well over these years, it's like we are still in perfect synch.   Then I heard Guu were in town!!  I was so disappointed guu didn't call me.  Even worse, I had to read about it in the newspapers and on a website.  I was hurt.  All that time we spent together didn't mean anything to guu?  I came down immediately to see guu only to discover that it'd be a two hour wait.  Guu whore!  How dare guu open yourself up to all these people?  I thought I was special!  I thought I was THE ONE!   But alas, how could I be mad at Guu?  I guess, it was never meant to be. I guess I was never going to keep guu all to myself. :(  I was glad that last Thursday, I could get there at 5:30 and not have to wait.  I finally managed to have guu again.  I was glad to see guu.  Guu looked different from what I last remember, but yet very much the same.  Guu're a little smaller but still just as sexy.     Aside from the constant yelling, which is cute at first, it can get a little annoying, but who's perfect right?   Promise me guu will never leave me again!  Promise?"}
{"text":"I am a fan! I was only in Toronto for a few days and did not have much time, but I loved this restaurant so much, I had to come back a second time.    So this place is very fun to eat at if you do not mind the noise level. Every time a customer comes in or leaves, the servers will shout things in Japanese- probably saying welcome and thank you for coming (I don't really know but it's fun to hear). The service is excellent. They are very friendly. I like being seated near the kitchen area since you have the opportunity to watch the cooks in action. It is very interesting to watch them make the food. They're really fast.    But what really draws me to this place is the excellent food. Most of the dishes are small and meant to be consumed with alcohol. I've tried many of the dishes on the menu and all were delicious. I suggest going in a bigger group so you have the opportunity to try many different dishes.   Suggested Items: -Bibimbap -Marinated Octopus with wasabi stem -Marinated Jellyfish -Deep Fried Prawn with Spicy Mayo -Beef Tongue Steak -Calamari -Mint Mojito Beer (yepp...mint mojito with....beer!)  Tip: They have a guestbook in the restroom. I don't know how clean that is. If you're up for it and don't mind touching something that others touched after they used the restroom, you should check it out.   Expect to pay anywhere from $25-$50 here. But it is worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place even though I was a little skeptical that they had a name change and I thought that it was a entirely different restaurant.   What used to be Guu still is Guu'd. The staff is the same the food is the same and the quality is .. the same.   The cheerfulness of the staff always catches me off guard as its also a great thing seeing people that (I think) enjoy their job.   The food is top-notch as each dish stands out a different way from the last one. Typically my order stays the same every-time I go unless they have something worth trying on their today's special menu.  TakoWasabi(Raw Octopus with Wasabi based dip comes with seaweed to use as \"dipper?), Takoyaki (Fried Octopus Balls), Ebi Mayo (Deep Fried tiger shrimp with mayo based sauce), Kaki Mayo(SP? Baked Oysters), Kiniko BiBamBop (Cheese and Mushroom Rice in a hot bowl), all are solid staples everytime I come here."}
{"text":"I love their food and drinks: from daily, monthly special to the classic menu. Everything tastes amazingly good. Such a nice place.  Really nice how the stuff is always greeting the new customers. However, they have to be a bit more careful when they shout close to the people's ears."}
{"text":"When we eat we don't just want good food, but to have a good experience with the whole restaurant. Guu delivers on good food.   But fails in all other aspects.   -portions are insultingly small compared to the price. I don't mind paying top dollar but I want value. And you just feel ripped off here.   - the noise level from the staff is ridiculous. Its near constant yelling. I don't know how they can all work there for more than a day. They must lose their voices within the week. It is extremely annoying.   - space..... There isn't any of it.... The seats/tables are too small and close together for normal sized adults to sit comfortably...   Now the food may taste good but for the reasons mentioned I will not be going back.   I like to be treated like an adult, and eating at guu is like eating in a kindergarden classroom. The portions are tiny, the furniture is tiny, and everyone around you is yelling."}
{"text":"Super fun environment and great food. The steak salad (I can't remember the actual name) and the deep fried brie cheese are to die for. Also, sake mojitos. Lots of sake mojitos."}
{"text":"We love the energy, everyone is very nice. Contrary to what ive heard the music. Its fantastic. Food is fresh and great. A+++"}
{"text":"Awesome food and atmosphere, service was a little lacking. My SO and I came here on a whim (actually after getting off at the wrong subway station lol). We saw a place that seemed poppin' with a line out the door and decided to check it out.  It was a busy weekday night and our wait was about an hour. Went to a Starbucks down the street while we waited for our reservation. Came back at the recommended time, got led to another waiting room and got served some tea while we waited a little more. True to its name, as soon as we were seated, we got an energetic welcome by the cooks and waitstaff.   Got the grilled saba, a 3 hand roll special, and agedashi tofu. Super super yummy and pretty authentic imho. Definitely be sure to check their \"special\" menu (should be on a piece of plain white paper).  So we got seated at the bar and I guess that's not the best choice if you aren't used to the environment. Since the cooks are right in front of you, you get treated to a shouting match everytime someone enters/leaves the restaurant. Definitely not the place to hold a conversation with anyone. If I come back, I'd definitely request to be seated at a table instead. The waiters/waitresses also seem to serve bar patrons less? I felt like I never got enough water. And we actually wanted another dish but we couldn't flag down a waitress. Even if you sit at the bar, you can't order directly to the chefs.    It was a *little* pricy as well. To be honest, unless I was in the area, I probably won't be back. It was a fun experience, but I feel like I could find a more affordable/peaceful place elsewhere."}
{"text":"Blah. Kinka is going downhill. Tonight I was served salmon tataki that was not fresh and on a cold plate, as if it was leftovers from the previous night. Then an okonomiyaki with raw batter inside... when I told the server... she just responded with a \"no\". A server took away our dishes with food still unfinished.   Being a long time supporter... quite disappointed in my experience tonight."}
{"text":"They sure know how to be merry and festive.  All the servers are screaming at the town not their lungs greetings guests in and out.  I picked the bar seating area for shorter wait and also a view to the kitchen.  The menu is filled with comfort Japanese dishes, mostly cooked but they do have sushi, sashimi and the likes.  Reading through the menu reminds me a bit of Taisho in NYC.   Sake flight - $11 for three glasses of sake.  I asked the server to help pick three of her favorites and they are mine as well now.  Salmon nato - $9 It has this slimy texture from the mayo which I happens to love but some of the patrons were looking at me in disgust.  It comes with seaweed paper which is both practical (ease of eating it) and also providing a crispy element to the texture.  Nato is an acquired taste and this is the perfect dish for your initiation.  I'll order this again.  Buta kimchi rice pot - $10.  Just average but it did fill me up.  Reminisce of bim bim bap and it fulfilled my carb crave.  Service is efficient but the screaming across the rooms did get to me after a while.  Be ready for a shouting match."}
{"text":"The most reviewed location in Yelp Toronto and well worth the hype! Came in here for Susan G's birthday night dinner and Guu is really the most epic place I've been to in Toronto. It's extremely loud inside (maybe the patio might shield you from some of that if for some reason that's what you would prefer) and such a great location for a group (not a large one as seating would be an issue). We went on a Monday night, which might explain why my party was able to get a table straight away, but the place was still packed regardless. All the staff shout loud greetings at everyone that walks in, although I must admit I think they missed me :(. I am curious to see if they do any specific ritual to get themselves pumped up for their 8 or so hour shift each night for I highly doubt they are naturally that outgoing and awesome.   Our waiter was extremely friendly (I think they must all be) and like it's been mentioned here a few times, service was extremely fast. The food was not cheap and I came in hungry. We were recommended to order 10 dishes for our party of 4 and by the end of the night we had ordered 13 dishes, 3 desserts, one 1/4L drink and 3 shots of sake. Overall the bill came to $129, which I think is pretty reasonable. Not every dish hit the sweet spot for me which I believe is the only negative I have, and that too might be stretching it. I can say, the fried chicken while good didn't leave me craving for more, but they have so many interesting dishes on the menu I can't wait to go back until I've sampled all!  Our 1/4L Sake drink was really good although the sake taste was a little hidden, but the sake tasting samples we had were all really interesting, I definitely recommend it if you just want to give different sake's a go.   Since it was Susan G's birthday and like she mentions in her review, the staff here do the most enthusiastic and loud birthday song you will ever encounter. You can't help but clap or sing a long even if it's a stranger's birthday!  Guu has all the requirements for a great dining experience, good food, drinks, staff, atmosphere all to be had without having you empty out your wallet!"}
{"text":"I have officially been de-Guu-ed... TF:  \"What?  You've NEVER been to Guu?\" YT: \"Nope.\" TF: \"What kind of Yelp Elite ARE you?\"  I guess now I CAN actually have the audacity to call myself Elite?  I know...   A tribute to music and to TF tagline:   You're just too good to be true. Can't take my eyes off Guu. You'd be like Heaven to eat. I wanna hold you so sweet. At long last love has arrived And I thank God I'm alive. You're just too good to be true. Can't take my eyes off Guu.  That probably failed miserably.. I should leave the song tributes to TF.  We (okay, one of us) arrived at 5:30PM and snagged the 2nd last table.  They start the clock on you as there is a seating time limit of 2 hours.  So if you miss the first sitting, you will most likely be waiting for a long time.  At least now that the weather's nicer it isn't so much of a drag to wait and they have introduced a covered waiting area, so even if it is cold you can get some shelter.  Nothing's over until the girl with the huge lungs belts out her random Japanese in her window shattering, shrilly voice!  Even the fat lady has to move over!  I felt like I was in the middle of an Amazon war zone.  I would say that the megaphone-style shouting actually would deter me from coming back.  It goes from being unique and novel to darn right annoying... I think I was temporarily deaf for the next few hours following my meal there.  I believe that if the food is good, which, in Guu's case, it IS... that you don't need to do all that to differentiate yourself... The food says it all!  We ordered the following: Deep Fried Rice Ball w/ Beef Tongue & Pickled Ginger in Oden Soup: Very very yummy!  There was a nice crust to the rice ball, and the soup didn't make it soggy.  The soup base was very very flavourful as well.  Deep Fried Cod w/ Sweet Chili Sauce: This was amazing as well.  The sweet chili sauce was not too overpowering, and the cod batter was divine.  KAKIMAYO (Grilled oysters with spinach, garlic mayo and cheese on the top):  This dish alone is worth the 2 hour wait.  It is extremely creamy and flavourful.  I could've ordered 6 orders of this and nothing else.  This may qualify as \"one of the items that I'd want to eat if I were ever to be sentenced to death - the last supper...\"  TAKOYAKI (Deep fried puffed octopus balls served with TONKATSU sauce and mustard mayo):  Again, this would qualify as a last supper item!  The actual sliver of octopus is virtually non-existent, but the potatoe-y, creamy texture of the deep fried octopus ball is TO DIE FOR!  (I swear Guu is going to make me commit some crime just to get a last supper list started?!)  SALMON NATTO YUKKE (Chopped salmon sashimi with seven friend: Natto, shibazuke, takuan, wonton chips, garlic chips, green onion and raw egg yolk) mixed and wrapped in nori:  This was probably the weakest dish of the entire evening and I could've done without it.  I didn't quite like the slimy texture that the egg yolk gave to the dish, and it was laced in sodium (e.g. the dominant flavour was the soy sauce).  In terms of drinks I ordered a Sake Mojito.  It was an interesting twist, but I think I prefer the original Mojito much more.  5 stars for the food, deduct one star for the shouting... Because the food is so good I probably would put up with the Amazon war cries and come to Guu again... Will just have to make sure I bring ear plugs with me :p"}
{"text":"Best Japanese Izakaya in Toronto voted by Cinnia  If your looking for different Japanese, apart from the traditional Sushi and bento boxes, then you have found Guu Izakaya.  This place originated from Vancouver and has the best flavors of Japan mixed together.  Izakaya = tapas = small portions, so order lots and try the different dishes!    - Great Price on food and sake - Great Staff Energy - Delicious Food, no compromise - Great atmosphere, if you like crowded  Tips:  - They don't take reservations, you need to wait for a bit but it usually goes by pretty fast and it's so, so worth it!!  Don't go with lots of people, can facilitate bigger groups, but it is a small restaurant.  Try everything, it's ALL great! - Must try: Salmon Natto Yuke, Tuna Tataki, and Gommae"}
{"text":"Great staff and service.  They greet every customer with \"Irashaimase\" japanese for \"Welcome!\".  The food is delicious and very authentic. For meals, I would recommend going at lunch as they have a good selection of lunch items. Dinner menu is more for finger food while you drink with friends rather than hearty meal items.  Would recommend and go back whenever I can."}
{"text":"Kinka Izakaya has the best oyster in shell with cheese, its rich, the oysters are huge and it's unique to the restaurant. I would go back just to have this, and the mushroom rice which has a really great flavour. The restaurant is very loud with a rowdy atmosphere, which can be fun if that's what youre looking for."}
{"text":"Cute place. Food was good and service was even better. Found it to be pretty affordable too!"}
{"text":"I don't know any other restaurant where I could possibly wait 2 hours for a table, start out my meal unbelievably pissed off, and be laughing and singing their praises by the end.   I don't know if it was the fun, communal atmosphere, delicious small plates, or the saki we drank out of a giant bamboo carafe, but it happened.  Guu is absolutely a great choice for dinner. Everything we ordered was delicious. But I HATE HATE HATE the 'no reservations' trend in this city. I would attempt it again at an 'off' time, but you won't catch me waiting 2 hours."}
{"text":"This place is stellar.  The tori karaag was off the charts good (I consider myself a connoisseur of fried chicken).  The stir fried rice and grilled beef entrees were also awesome.  I love the small plates, so you can try many things.  You need something to wash that all down with, so you might as well get some sake.  I remember having something with offals that was luke warm that I did not care for.  The staff is super fun and seems like there is a reason to sing or chant every few minutes (the sake may have had something to do with that)."}
{"text":"I've been to both the guu and kinka a few times, and things haven't changed much. The staff are still super friendly and full of energy! And the menu is about the same.   Almost everything I had here, was great! It really comes down to your culinary comfort zone. Best way experience Kinka is to come with friends and share different things on the menu.   I'd suggest bringing cash if you are here with a group. they do not split bills."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and each time has been great. Service has been good, food was good and the ambiance is different too.   The staff shouts at you in Japanese first thing you walk in. Kind of surprised me, the first time I went.  The baked oysters and carpaccio are a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Great variety of food and everything is delicious - food alone deserves 4 stars.  However, the servers seemed friendly when they all shouted to welcome you while you walked in...later you would find they just too busy to give you some proper attention...The other thing.. this places is WAYYYY TOO NOISY and CHAOTIC than I can accept....maybe because I don't go to pub/club/drinking places a lot and this place is definitely not for me...I planned to catch up with a friend at dinner but I couldn't hear her at all and I have to YELL to hear my own voice....too much for me...  IF YOU PLAN TO HAVE ANY CONVERSATION DURING DINNER, DON'T GO TO THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"This is a lively Japanese tapas bar. There's always a good time to be had at Kinka. It is a lively and loud bar. Always a party at Kinka.  We ordered an assortment of tapas to share, including: Takowasabi (marinated octopus), kurage (marinated jelly fish), maguro tataki, takoyaki, yaki undo, kinoko bibimbap and green tea ice cream. The tapas were all flavourful and well prepared. The bibimbap was delicious - different from the Korean style - dolsot bibimbap.    The more adventurous you are at Kinka, the more fun you will have! Try something different and out of the ordinary and wash it down with a sake bomb!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the stuffed oysters were particularly good.   Unfortunately, the portions were so tiny (I'm 105lbs and I left somewhat hungry) that I doubt I'd go back anytime soon, except maybe on a fuller stomach... or with a fuller wallet."}
{"text":"We had a lovely dining experience at Kinka Izakaya.  Found street parking. Came at an off time, as soon as it opened. There was plenty of seating available. Upon entering, we were warmly greeted. I like the laid back ambiance of this place. Service was great, attentive and sweet. Our server was really nice and we enjoyed having a convo with her.  We tried a few things, some of the standouts were the Gyu Shabu Salad, Karaage, and Gindara. The Gyu Shabu Salad had lovely thin slices of beef, cool crisp lettuce with a delicious light dressing. The dressing really makes this salad addicting. I wish I knew how to make it, I'd probably put it on everything. The Karaage reminded me a lot of Chicharrones de Pollo. The meat was super juicy with a lovely crisp exterior. Comes with a garlic mayo dipping sauce and lemon wedge. Squeeze some lemon on that chicken and dip it into the mayo, now we're in business. The Gindara (Black Cod) was melt in your mouth good. Delicate and flavorful. Their restrooms are clean and I love that they provide mouth rinse so you can freshen your breath after your meal.   We are fans!"}
{"text":"The Southwest corner at Mcgill and Yonge has been a hot spot for restaurants to set up shop, hoping to squeeze dollars from students empty pockets, last for a few months and inevitably fold. I witnessed the turn overs consistently, since the struggling real estate was en route home after classes. All that changed when Guu came along and built their fortress of Izakaya! In business for over a year and still going strong, Guu has left its neighbour, Mehran Restaurant wondering...WTF...What do they have that I dont...Oh Mehran, you have so much to learn.  FIRST: Guu has brought a niche experience of dining to Torontonians that has never been seen before. The best part about it - they're not trying to be an Izakaya, they are one! Countless Izakaya's have opened up across Toronto trying to leech off of the success of Guu. None of them have the aura and attitude Guu radiates. SECOND: Guu is as authentic as it gets for Japanese tapas bars. The owners are Japanese, the Chefs and Cooks are Japanese. The ingredients are traditional Japanese favorites found in Japanese bars.  THIRD: Service is exceptional. I love going to restaurants where I feel like I'm apart of the action/excitement. From the moment you walk in, you're greeted in Japanese by the entirety of the staff and some of the diners who join in. Guu makes you feel like you're apart of the family and this is a pivotal factor in their success. Oh, and they give you a fresh hot towel before you start your meal. Yes, I'm a sucker for a hot towel.  FOURTH: The food is unique and delicious. I love the Spinach dish in the appetizers, the salmon sashimi, the miso cod and a few items off the specials menu. I've been twice now and for the most part been impressed by the food but I've found a few dishes to be a miss for me. FIFTH: They haven't changed anything since they've started. They understand their customers and know how to deliver the experience every person walking in expects. They haven't sold out to success and I love them for that!  SOME TIPS: * Be adventurous. If you see something on the menu you typically wouldn't order, order it.  * Go hungry and with a friend who also is adventurous. You want to try at least 5 dishes between the two of you. * I know you can't be picky about seating but if a seat is open at the bar, snatch it. It's so much fun to watch the electricity in the kitchen. PLUS the chef is an ultimate hottie.  * Get there really early (5:30) or really late (9:30). Those are the only two times I've gotten in without waiting for more than 10 minutes. If you can't make that happen, they'll take your name and call you when your seat is available.   I would never have thought that any restaurant could have as much success as Guu has had at Mcgill and Yonge. Cheap rent and never without a line. I don't know if it's just dumb luck or they knew all along.  You have to try Guu, at least once in your lifetime. It's an experience!"}
{"text":"Food was great, it was packed with people and quite loud inside, but love the mood though. Would go there again."}
{"text":"Two friends and I came here on a Friday night to share some tapas, and I am very glad we waited the 30 minutes! The patio area is much preferred in the summer time because its quieter and breezier.  Of the dishes we had tried, I would urge you to try the UNAGI DORA, which is a scrumptious baked rice dish with BBQ eel, cheese and mushrooms; the OKONOMIYAKI; and the IKAPIRI (deep fried calamari drenched in sticky, spicy and sweet sauce).  I appreciated that the menu is quite extensive and you're not limited in your choices.   Not recommended for large groups unless you make a reservation well in advance."}
{"text":"Really great food to share with a couple of friends. It was one of those classic experiences where you have no idea what you are ordering but everything tastes good so you don't have to worry over the menu. Drinks are good too - nothing better than an ice cold sapporo."}
{"text":"Went here for Halloween weekend. Halloween is the perfect time to visit Kinka as everyone dresses up as something different and the restaurant is fully decorated. This year they even have a Prix fixe menu for $29/person (min 2 people). I got to say the Prix fixe menu wasn't quite enough for two so I had to order more dishes (...or maybe I just eat a lot). The Prix fixe menu came with chef's choice sashimi, tofu salad, baked oysters, takoyaki & karaage, flame steak, seafood bibimbap, and black sesame ice cream.  Sashimi platter - comes with salmon, tuna, and wagyu beef. Everything was super good. Except I ordered wagyu beef on the side not know it was included in the platter. Just kind of wish the waitress told me when I was ordering.  Tofu salad - great, fresh  Baked oysters - so delicious. I'm glad it was on the menu, I never would have ordered this a la carte.  Takoyaki & Karaage - Kinka takoyaki and karaage never disappoint me  Flame steak - 100% recommended. So juicy and just melts in your mouth.  Seafood bibimbap - there was squid and shrimp, with tomato sauce. Very good, but could use a little more seafood.  Black sesame ice cream - yum.  Service was great. Felt a little rushed as there were tons of walk-ins. Super loud, but I didn't mind as I really enjoyed the environment. Bonus points for the Halloween decor. The scarecrow scared me a little on my way to the bathroom haha!"}
{"text":"Very fun! We were seated outside, so we didn't to experience all of that lively atmosphere everyone talks about, and we were really jealous of the people seated inside! We caught bits of it every time the door opened though :P Our section was quiet, and would be perfect if you actually wanted to make conversation though. Staff was also very attentive.  I actually can't remember most of the food (because I was having THAT much fun at an eating establishment) but nothing was bad - had to be at least an average or better - or it would have ruined it for me. A definite must visit/ place to experience in Toronto."}
{"text":"Service was great she was very helpful Food was very good Atmosphere is very energetic and loud  Very fun place to go  They do not take reservations but if you are a party of three or more they will take your phone number and call you ten minutes before your table is ready allowing you to go to any of the many bars in the area."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of guu - oh sorry I mean kinka. And so it was nice to visit this location again. Despite the name change, the service and food stayed the same..and they were excellent. We had the baked oysters (my absolute fav), kimchi udon, mushroom bibimbapp, seared salmon, and Angus beef carpraccio (?). The bibimbapp this time around was a bit bland but it was still good, and Angus beef carpraccio was new to us and thought that was good too.   Servers were attentive and made sure that we were okay during our meal. I think we had about 5-6 dishes and total was about $50."}
{"text":"I love this place. Usually a long wait, so it helps to come ahead of time and speak to the dude at the door. they'll call/text you when youre up. the atmosphere is what makes this place...its loud. great to catch a bite to eat before a night out in the city."}
{"text":"Nothing but a fun place and great food.  Had a Yuso tofu for a starter. Silky deep fried tofu in tasty broth. Continued to salmon nattu which was not less than amazing (if you love nattu) and finished with Japanese curry in boiling stone pot.  Service was efficient and friendly and price is fair.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I went here with my friends and everything we ordered tasted amazing. There was nothing on the menu we did not like. The atmosphere was very fun too! The people who work there are great. The only downside is that it gets really busy and there is always a line up. Also, the atmosphere is loud, so I wouldn't go here for an intimate dinner."}
{"text":"Decent foid overall. The service is super fast, and generally tasty. Most dishes are fresh tasting, but often forgettable...the drinks are below average.  The thing that stands out the most is the environment. It is super loud...not necessarily a bad thing, but it does tend to get on your nerves a little over the course of the evening."}
{"text":"This place reminds of me Kinka Izakaya in Montreal...which is a good thing because it is a superb joint! I really liked the korroke and the deep fried cheese triangles as well as the carpaccio/tataki! Service was prompt and friendly. My boyfriend and his friend sat on the floor and we had to take our shoes off and wear slippers. This part was really cool and one my favorite parts of the izakaya experience. PLUS I get to feel like im sitting at home in a comfy environment, (sitting pretzel or criss cross applesauce style haha) We ordered several dishes because yes this is a tapas sharing is caring place.   The atmosphere was nice and chic, and it is located in downtown area. Of course they do the typical \"screaming\" at you to welcome you. You feel special, you feel awesome. At least I do! I recommend anything on this menu because I have the greatest confidence they are all tasty. Seriously though. They also have special of the day and do birthday specials, I just forget what exactly the special deal was. But hey, if it's your birthday soon, why not take this opportunity to find out and enjoy izakaya experience! I see why this place received many stars. Good place, good place!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but you come here more for the ambience. The place is LOUD - from the music, to the screaming chefs, to the big roaring welcome as soon as you walk in, and the general acoustics of being one big dining room. That said, it's a lot of fun. I was in town for TIFF and wanted a fun place to check out while I was dining solo, and this place was great. Something about the loudness makes everyone friendlier and nicer to each other.  You're either sitting at big communal picnic tables, or beside people at the sushi bar, so it's easy to jump into conversations. (There's also a patio, but I was seated inside so I can't speak to that.)  Service was good - my server came to check on me a few times, and food came out pretty quickly.  I kept my meal simple and ordered the fried pork w/ honey sauce and the rice pot w/ squid, which was a special.  The rice pot was eh, but the pork was yummy.  (Isn't pork always yummy??)  This would be a great place to check out w/ a group of friends or for a bday dinner. But even solo, this place was a lot of fun."}
{"text":"After our first attempt to get in on a Saturday (the wait was too long), we decided to try a Tuesday evening and we're so glad we did! The food was killer. Perfectly balanced, seasoned and saucy (actually used a spoon to sop up all the goodness). Loved the tuna sashimi with garlic chips, fried oysters 3 ways and the BBQ pork. We actually ate a lot because everything sounded so good. As did everything else coming out of the kitchen. Next time we go, we'll need to try the bibimbap!"}
{"text":"Nice flavours.  Great fish dishes. Lots of sashimi and red meat. It's a very loud atmosphere. Group seating set up and bar.   Good value for Japanese food."}
{"text":"Okay except for the long wait time (still?!) the place still lives up to it's quality even after about 2 years since opening.   After thinking that I was going to the other location, I was little disappointed (only at first!) My last experience here was a little lacklustre, and full of too many fried foods.   Our friend Patrick M. waited patiently for a table of 3 on a Saturday night (THANKS PAT!). Ordering was easy for me, as a veteran of these restos now.  My usual strategy, is to get my favourites, plus ones that will fill you up significantly.   My staples here are:  - Pumpkin Croquette  - Takoyaki  - Beef Short Ribs  - Kimchi Udon  - BimBimbap (awesome the first time you have it, nothing special on subsequent tries)  - some type of grilled fish (same price as most dishes, but big portion)  - either Salmon Natto Yukke or Spicy BC Tuna version  I usually try to stay away from the Sashimi, although very fresh, $8 for only a few pieces doesn't sit well with me.   Their specials change every month, and we were lucky it was Oct1st. Today they had NonKostu Karaage (deep fried chicken cartilage) It's my favourite, and not a lot of restaurants have this on their regular menus. It was divine.   I was very happy with the service, as opposed to the Bloor location. Could be that the guy in t he area was very good. We never had to wait for him to flag him down bc he would already be around. And the food came awfully quickly (smart for them bc of the long line up outside).   Dessert wasn't as good as the Bloor location (no Sake Tiramisu). Instead we had a deep fried green ice cream, and baked/mashed sweet potato (both off the specials menu). Nothing to call home about.   Our meal for 3, including a big $20 bottle of sake was around $120. I'm not sure how in my first visit (and review) I spent only $20 a person.... I bet that with more people , the less you spend.  P.S. if you want to sit outside (esp in this cold weather) there is no line up! haha"}
{"text":"So I decided to check up on the hype and decide for myself whether the Guushing about this new izakaya is worth it.  I absolutely refuse to queue up for an hour to eat anywhere so we decided to get there early enough to beat the starving masses. You are greeted by a cacaphony of welcoming shouts from the staff \"IRASSHAIMASEEEE!!!!\"  Much like their Spanish tapas counterparts, Izakayas are basically japanese style pubs where the emphasis is typically on small platters of goodies to go with your beer or sake.  And in this way Guu definitely delivers.  While I can't say that any one dish stood out from the others, I was hard pressed to find anything unlikable - every morsel was a tasty savoury treat. I liked the friendly atmosphere and the communal tables but couldn't get over the cacaphony of shouting and chatter.  Be prepared for an aural assualt! It's definitely not a place to bring a date but bring a few friends, pick on a few dishes, drink a few beers and then move on after your 2 hours are up."}
{"text":"I always feel incredibly nostaglic going into this restaurant. The general vibe feels chaotic and wonderful, like I have stepped back in time and returned to living in Japan.  The food is wonderful, one of the few places I will go for okonomiyaki in the city. If you are in the area definitely check this spot out!"}
{"text":"Gird your loins and brace your ears because from the moment you cross the threshold into the restaurant, you're in their world and in their world, it's non-stop screaming excitement. Literally. If you have sensitive ears or want to eat at some place quiet and intimate where you can lock eyes with your date over the shimmering candlelit dinner while a sweet sounds of a violinist playing embraces you, then this is definitely NOT the place for you.  If you read this and you've never been, when you walk through the door, make sure to have your biggest smile on and scream back at them. Trust me, it'll make sense once you're there and experience it.  I went here with three other people and in total we ordered about 13 dishes and a few bottles of sake (you can't have Japanese without sake and you have to get it hot) and though there were some definite winners, I would say a good chunk of them 5-7 were decently good and 1-2 dishes that were just ok (probably wouldn't order it again considering there's better things on the menu). We ordered dishes from the seafood section to the noodle dishes to the exotic choices. One of our most favorite (and unexpectedly so) was the udon bowl. It was evenly flavorful and not one taste blasted out the others. I wish we had ordered more udon bowls. And our least favorite was the sushi dish. It was good but not something we'd order again considering the other choices that were amazing.  The seating arrangement is close so you'll probably be sharing a table with someone or at the very least, be close enough to be sharing a table with someone.  I would STRONGLY, STRONGLY recommend you make reservations and make them the day before since they don't take same day reservations (at least when we called). We had to wait 45 mins but that was considered average since after we came in, the wait extended to over an hour.  I would also strongly suggest you either take the streetcar or taxi here since parking here can be a pain if you drive, plus, there're so many bars to go to afterwards and you want to get home or your last destination responsibly.  Parking: Limited paid street or paid lot Price: $30+ per person Wait: 30-45 mins to get seated (make reservations a day in advance)"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Everything about it was fun - the decor, the greeting, the food. It was one of my favorites in Toronto. But the last time I was there I ordered one of the salads (can't remember which one) and dug in. After a couple of chews, I noticed a strange sensation in mouth. Something wasn't right. I spat it out to see a used bandaid! How f$&@ing disgusting is that! Nevertheless, I discreetly called over the waiter and asked to speak to the manager. The manager offered not to bill me for that one dish - that's it! People prepping food in the kitchen have cuts on their hands, ARE NOT WEARING GLOVES and their band aids are coming off in the food - and the most they will do is comp you the contaminated dish! Unbelievable and unacceptable. If you like bandages in your food then this is the place for you. I WILL NEVER GO BACK."}
{"text":"Let me just start the review by stating that this was one of my favorite meals in ages.  My guy and I generally don't have the same taste in food, as such, we tend to have different favorite restaurants when we travel.  However, in this case, we were in complete agreement that this was our favorite restaurant in Toronto.  The only downside about having this place as our shared favorite restaurant is that Toronto is too far away!  I wish we can come here every week, and I want to try every single dish on this menu.    I've picked this place purely because it was close to our hotel.  We were exhausted from a whole day of walking around and didn't feel like trekking out too far to grab dinner.  The chefs and waiters greet you loudly as you enter the restaurant, while hip-pop is blasting from the speaker.  I turned to the guy, and said, so much for our quiet dinner.  The restaurant was pretty full, and they seated us at the bar.  Even though we were extremely tired, we soon got swept up by the fun atmosphere and mesmerized by the frenzy in the open kitchen.  We decided to split a bottle of sake, and ordered a bunch of dishes to share, then the gushing started... We ooh'ed and ahh'ed through the procession of plates that were presented in front of us:  Saba Nanban (deep fried mackerel) - my absolute favorite dish of the night.  It was part of the daily special.  I love mackerel, and this one was fried to perfection with the most amazing nan ban sauce.  I don't know what nan ban sauce is, I just really want to add it to everything I eat.  The fish was also topped with this creamy sauce that was almost like a tartar sauce and was a refreshing addition to the fried fish.  Now fish itself was well seasoned, crispy on the outside and flaky on the side.  I want to eat this every day.  Kurage (jellyfish) - I think the jellyfish is mixed with rice noodles to give the dish a different texture.  I am not quite sure about the noodle part, but I am sure about how perfect the jellyfish is marinated.  Sometimes, jellyfish dish could be slimy or grainy, this one was perfectly smooth.  Spicy Take (octopus sashimi) - another flavor bomb, the octopus paired well the garlic soy sauce, the cucumbers and tiny spoonful of roe.    Gyu Carpaccio - so I've been eating a lot of beef carpaccio lately, I didn't notice until I've begin to catch up on my reviews.  Anyway, out of all the ones I've tried recently, this was the best.  The beef was lightly seared to give it beautiful color and lightly crunchy edge.  The ponzu and wasabi mayo sauce give the dish a kick, while the daikon in the middle provided the crunchy texture   Kimchi Udon - loved the creaminess provided by the cod roe, the spiciness of the kimchi, and the chewiness of the udon.  It was a simple dish, but so delicious  Karubi (grilled beef ribs) - unfortunately, this was our least favorite dish.  The flavor was fine, but I think the beef was overcooked, so it was a bit dry and very chewy.  The scallion sauce was a nice addition.  It was almost embarrassing how much we were fawning over the dishes.  Our entire conversation during dinner consisted of mainly \"Oh my god, this is amazing\", \"What the hell is in this, why is so delicious\", \"how many more dishes do you think we can eat before we regret it\", \"I never want to leave here\".  Eventually, the guy talked me down from gorging myself to death, and promised that we will come back here soon.  Now, please excuse me while I figure out when we can go back to Toronto again!!"}
{"text":"Not sure if I love this place.. the place is cute, everyone that works there greets you loudly as you walk in and says bye as you leave, they really try to give you a Japanese culture experience here I guess. There are three big communal tables, as well as a few tables outside, and bar seats. We called and left our names an hour before we arrived and got seated right away.  I got the orange high drink? The menu says it comes with a whole orange.. it literally came with a whole orange that you have to squeeze into the drink yourself .. this was definitely an interesting experience, drink wasn't bad either.  For three people we ordered salmon tataki, sashimi salad, salmon natto yukke, mackerel sushi, yaki udon, pumpkin croquette, and soy garlic wings?(special of the night). Loved the salmon tataki! The ponzu sauce and garlic crisps definitely gave it the right amount of flavor. The sashimi salad was good but I wish they would use maybe romaine lettuce instead of iceberg. I'm not a huge fan of mackerel in general, but the seared mackerel on the sushi wasn't bad at all, I think the sweet soy sauce it had on top really helped with that. The salmon natto yukke was definitely interesting.. this is the first time I tried natto beans.. I think it's a form of fermented beans? The waitress mixed this dish together for us, we wrapped it with seaweed. The beans definitely drive the texture for the whole dish, it was all very slimy and sticky..? If that's how you can describe it. The flavor definitely wasn't bad but I believe natto beans is an acquired taste which I have not acquired.. so I don't think I'll be having this again if I return here. The yaki udon was way too salty!! Not a fan of this. The pumpkin croquette was scotch egg styled, with a hard boiled egg in the middle. It wasn't bad, if you're a fan of scotch eggs and pumpkin this is the dish for you. Really enjoyed the wings, they were on the sweeter side.  This is an IZAKAYA, everything is pretty much the portion of tapas, and they come as they are made. I wasn't stuffed, but wasn't left starving either. Overall a pretty good experience here, didn't love every dish, but all in all, this place wasn't bad at all."}
{"text":"I love Japanese food and heard so many great things about guu. Gotta say I was pretty disappointed with the food. We ordered 5 different dished and found that the BBQ pork dish was by far the best but still lacked in favour. I give the atmosphere two stars and the food one. I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"Everything on their menu sounded delicious, so I had a hard time deciding. The gyu carpaccio was a little chewy, but I like the added textures of the shredded daikon and the garlic chips. Garlic chips also added texture and flavor to the tuna tartare. For dessert, I had the light and sweet almond tofu. If you don't mind the noise, you will have an enjoyable time with delicious food.   It's a very loud and energetic atmosphere they have going on. The staff yelled their greeting when I came in. The servers yell customers orders to the chefs and the chefs yell back. When someone is doing a sake bomb, there's yelling. And when I left, they yelled their goodbye. I wonder if they ever lose their voice."}
{"text":"One of the interesting restaurants In the city.. I went there without reading the reviews and want aware of the grand greeting ;). People might have guessed that I was a first timer by my shocked expression. We first sat out at the patio but them I felt like I was missing all the fun inside so moved in.  Food was good especially considering I'm a vegetarian . There isn't a whole lot of options.. Ordered spinach with sesame sauce.. It was delish! I ordered the Brie as well ..was crisp and nice!for main course ordered a hot pot with mushroom , rice , cheese and seaweed .. It was awesome!!"}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from kinkya izakaya and decided to give it a try for a Saturday lunch with the boyfriend.   He ordered the ramen and I had the sushi platter special. In addition we got the cheese bake mussels and takoyaki. My boyfriend really enjoyed the ramen and said it was comparable to Sensotei. The sashimi was fresh and the appetizers we shared were super tasty. The cheese mussels though are really saucy and rich- just an FYI!   I really enjoyed the environment as it was fun and casual. However the service was slow, but the waitress was really nice - just get their attention if something is needed. Will definitely be coming back. :)   Visited: December 10th 2017"}
{"text":"Warning: if you're not a fan of communal/bar/loud places, avoid this place. But if you like all that stuff, and good music, don't be afraid to come!   Every single time I've been here, the food is consistently delicious. There has not been a time that I've noticed that something is \"off\". The first time I came here was about two years ago, at the Bloor location, when it used to be called \"Guu Izakaya\". Since then, I've been here almost 30 or so times. The tapa selection is so delicious. The ingredients are fresh, especially the sashimi. I'm blown away by the specials they have every time.  When I go here alone, I spend about $30 on myself. Which is very filling.  I recommend: - Sashimi Salad - Salmon Tataki * - Ikapiri * - Takoyaki * - Brie Cheese - Unagi Doria * - Kinoko Bibimbap * - Kakimayo *  And for drinks, I love the Cherry Blossom drink when I'm feeling frilly. Or just a good ol' pint of Sapporo.   If I have any friends who think Japanese food is all about sushi, I take them here to change their minds!  The only downside is that the service can be a little lacking. Depending on the server and the night. It sucks when you have to flag down your server to no avail sometimes. But that's very rare.   P.S. This place is popular so expect a wait time on busy nights. I recommend you to make a reservation online. Alsoooooo - parking. Don't park at the expensive a$$ parking lot next door. Park on the street where the residential areas are! You'll thank me. It's Green P so you know you won't be spending a flat rate of $15 on parking. More money saved for food."}
{"text":"its delicious. its loud. its funny. seems like the perfect entertaining japanese food experience!"}
{"text":"Really authentic Japanese food! The Yakiudon is so good that I wanna cry. I would also suggest the pork cheek and the grilled oysters. Music is too loud for me though."}
{"text":"Really good :) went here for a date in the summer ! However, the wait is a little ridiculous (45mins-an hour) and it's out in the middle of no where (looks a little sketchy) but overall service and food is great !"}
{"text":"Came here after work on a Friday. When we got there around 5:45, it was already packed. First impression, I loved the atmosphere of it, it was dim but a very cozy ambiance. We were informed that it will be a 45 min to an hour wait. It was still early for dinner so we agreed to wait. We left our name and phone number and off we went. Luckily, there's a massive Loblaws at Church and Carlton, a 5 min walk. We just spent our time there. When we went back at 6:30, more people were waiting and a line started to form outside, the hostess was outside writing people's names. We went up to her and asked whether a table is available for us yet. She informed us that she had called us about 30 minutes ago, but we never picked up. We never got any miss calls though, but no biggie, we got a table 10 minutes after.  They have a variety of small dishes to choose from. So it's a good idea to go there with a group so you can try different dishes without emptying your wallet. We tried several different dishes, and there isn't anything bad to say about any of them. They were all very yummy in their own way :o  This restaurant definitely provides its customers with a different type of experience. The staff would regularly chant slogans, and welcome people loudly. Almost all of their communication is done through shouting.  Either way, nothing much to complain about, and quite a few compliments for the food and unique atmosphere."}
{"text":"They have such a great atmosphere. Everything on this menu is delicious. I came here with my friend. She had the donburi with mushroom and beef and egg. It comes with miso soup as well. She really liked it and I had a taste and thought it was very nice. I had the fried mackerel udon. It was very good. Loved the fish, but it had bits of bone. The udon was exactly as I expected. The noodles were fat and soft and slurpy. My only wish is that they was more because I didn't feel entirely full. Lastly, we had the octopus balls. They so great. Must be my favourite thing of this lunch. It was nicely fried and has a generous amount of toppings, with the flakes and nori and mayo and other things. Obviously, I'll be back again, probably for dinner."}
{"text":"Interesting Ambuance and trendy Japaneae Izakaya in Totonto next to University. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"BEST JAPANESE TAPAS I HAVE EVER HAD!  Must Try: YAKIUDON ***MOST AMAZING DISH**** KAKIMAYO SALMON TATAKI GYU CARPACCIO  There is absolutely nothing on this menu that is not good! Everything is guaranteed delicious! Yakiudon was our personal favorite so much so that we had to order a second Yakiudon in the middle of our meal! Yakiudon is pan-fried udon with a creamy sauce that coats your whole mouth with yumminess! MUST TRY!!!  Kakimayo is another recommendation for those who love cheese and even if you dont, it is still amazing and an experience all on its own! The oysters are not overbaked and the cheese adds the perfect saltiness! AMAZING!  Ambience: Super loud, great late night spot for beers and gathering! May not be a great place if you looking to have a conversation, but there is always the outside porch of the restaurant! All the staff stop and greet you as you walk through the big doors! Or should I say shout \"Welcome\" in Japanese!  COMING BACK TO TORONTO just to have more Kinka Izakaya!"}
{"text":"Uh, yum!!! I was intimidated by tales of epic lineups so hadn't stopped by yet. I chose 5:30pm on the Tuesday after Pride weekend to visit on the assumption that locals would still be nursing hangovers and a table would be relatively easy to get. I was right. Although the hostess did let me know when I arrived that they have a 2-hour seating limit, there was no wait and the restaurant didn't quite fill during our stay. We chose the patio, which is slightly less loud and hectic than the main room.  We chose a number of dishes from the regular and specials menu. Some were more successful than others. A raw octopus and wasabi stem appetizer was incredibly fresh and flavourful, and a fantastic value at $3.80. Other dishes were good but less special - my dinner companion really enjoyed the grilled pork cheeks with ponzu, while I found it a little bit bland. Of course the wonderful thing about a tapas-style menu is that you can order a variety of dishes, and if one doesn't satisfy it's likely that the next one will. Everything was very nicely prepared and beautifully presented. Some dishes take longer to make than others, so we did have a bit of a lag between dishes at one point and had to wait a while for the next course.  The staff were friendly, if a bit harried, and I certainly understand why this place has a following.  Dinner for 2 with beer was $60, which is incredible value for food of this quality in Toronto. I'll be back."}
{"text":"A fun place for a delicious dinner! My husband and I had a wonderful dinner at Kinka. We ordered the set menu and it did not disappoint! We would definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Been here several times while it was still Guu and again when it became Kinka. No difference. Good izakaya type food.  Tip: Get the okonomoyaki and takoyaki."}
{"text":"Really yummy, cozy setting for small groups. When I asked if they only had the two vegetarian options the staff went above and beyond to vegetarianize one of the mains. Will be back."}
{"text":"Guu is definitely a wonderful choice for some authentic Japanese cuisine in Toronto. It's important to choose the right menu items as some are better than others, but rest-assured almost all of the items on the menu are delicious. I usually come in large parties so we end up sharing all of the items we get, so that's definitely an advantage of coming in with a large group!   The Kakimayo at Guu is AMAZING. I would just come and order two plates of the Kakimayo and cal it a meal. The cheese infused with the oysters and the mushrooms is simply divine and I definitely recommend this item to everyone. Some other favourites of mine include the karage, the karubi, and the ssashimi daily specials.   The customer service here is exceptional and the lively, electric, and energetic atmosphere at Guu is unmatched. Prices and portions are also fair."}
{"text":"I came here around 1:50pm on a Saturday, right before last call for lunch service. The restaurant was relatively empty at that time, and wasn't as loud and hectic as the last time I visited, which was nice because I felt I got to focus more on the food that was presented than the atmosphere within the restaurant. The best part about lunch service is probably their lunch options. Apart from some ramen dishes, they also serve some lunch specials like karage with rice which also comes with a side of soup and salad. You can also order from their standard menu, which has a wide variety of small plates to share.   I went with my favourite, the baked oysters, I also tried their sashimi special, the okonomiyaki, fried Brie, and their karage chicken lunch special. Everything was piping hot when it arrived and tasted incredible. The sashimi was fresh and some pieces had a nice light sear to them. The Brie wasn't overly rich and had a nice mango sauce to cut through the fat. Although you only get two pieces for the baked oysters, I would say it's well worth the price-it's cheesy, which complements the oysters nicely.   If you're not a huge fan of the loud nature of izakayas, give this place a shot near the end of lunch service, it's definitely more calm. Don't give up the opportunity to try some really good Japanese food just because you don't enjoy loud settings!"}
{"text":"Great ebimayo & chicken karaage. I've been to quite a few izakayas & this one was particularly loud. Good atmosphere but very difficult to have a conversation. All in all, a good experience."}
{"text":"Voila 5 étoiles bien méritées !  Vous arrivez et dès l'extérieur vous ne comprenez même pas ou la porte se trouve. On voit une terrasse, mais pas l'entrée... On cherche, on trouve. On ouvre la porte et...  Tout le staff (et quelque client)  se tourne vers vous en criant de joie leur bienvenu (en japonais..). Jamais vu un accueil pareil! Genre vent personnes qui se tournent en criant au même temps leur joie de vous voir..  Si vous n'aimez pas être au centre de l'attention vous pouvez essayer de ramper mais pas sur que ça marche...  Ambiance super festive, tout le monde s'amuse, rigole et.. Parle très fort.. N'y emmenez pas des clients pour un diner d'affaires, vous comprendriez rien! Mais c'est fun ! A la limite votre belle mère : parmi les bruits de la salle sa voix de perdra comme par magie et vous n'aurez que a sourire en secouant la tête..  On a partagé plusieurs assiettes : tataki de thon, calamars, poulpe, nouilles au poisson et au buf, maki de tous les genres (même avec du poulet frit et de la sauce ailloli)!  Un vrai régal ! Le service est assez rapide, les serveurs souriants et a l'écoute (imaginez la conversation entre un italien qui vit en France et parle anglais avec une québécoise japonaise.. A mourir de rire ) .  Et la qualité.. Quelle qualité ! Au top!   J'avoue qu'il faut aimer l'ambiance mais ceci dit c'est sûrement à tester : totalement différent de tous les restos japonais que j'ai vu jusqu'à aujourd'hui !"}
{"text":"Delicious and hilarious and cool and affordable.  I love this place so much it's crazy. Makes other restaurants seem unfriendly cause they don't yell happy greetings when you come and go."}
{"text":"Tasty but LOUD. Not much fish in the sashimi salad. Portions on the small side. I may try again one day."}
{"text":"Yes, be prepared to spend a lot of money. I was warned beforehand by a couple of friends but it still doesn't minimize the damage to my wallet. But be prepared to also have your stomach wow'd by the variety of delicious and creative dishes they serve. It's tapas style, little portions that can be shared and the more people you have, the more you can try.   Let's talk about the famous atmosphere. I've never been to a restaurant that was so loud. But in such a good way. The servers really pump you up about what you're eating and they make you feel excited just to be there.   Then onto the food itself, simply wonderful. From their sashimi to their fried foods to their udon, everything is really great. Sitting at the bar, I was able to watch them prepare everything with great enthusiasm. That Fried Brie Cheese is something else. So interesting and so good. Their cocktails are pretty great too. I had the Red Dragon which was some sort of alcohol mixed with watermelon juice. Perfect for a summer's day. I did see some other people get some sort of drink served in a piece of bamboo which looked really awesome.   Overall, this was a little piece of authentic Japanese food and atmosphere in downtown Toronto. I absolutely loved my experience and would recommend going there 100%. Just be prepared to be around some yelling and cheering: over you, around you, at you. It's all in good fun though :)"}
{"text":"Super lively! I only had the okonomiyaki pancake which was doused with too much sauce but I'm willing to come back to try other things here. I had food envy whilst I had my pancake, everything looked yummy."}
{"text":"I don't know how you give 5 star to a restaurant that is loud as hell. I love to party but can't stand it when you try to eat and then suddenly waiter yell out loud. People run around everywhere.  The food is good but not for what you pay for because it portion is too small."}
{"text":"Overhyped. Sure the environment and very enthuastic staff are amazing but food is mediorce at best. Nothing particularly stood out for me here.   Drinks ordered:  Passion - this was pretty good, Japanese soda , rum, and lynchee Plumpy - not so good, I was hoping for a sweet drink but it was too sour for my taste from the grapefruit juice  Food items ordered:  Takowasabi - marinated octupus : it was decent but portion size was a joke but what you paid for. you get 1.5 spoonful of octopus bits for 4 bucks. way over priced, you get more portion elsewhere for this price  Okonomiyaki - Japanese seafood pancake : never a fan of this; I would not eat this again;this place reminded me how un appetizing it is; reminds me of a sushi pizza  Amberjack sashimi - pretty good but again overpriced  Gyu Carpaccio - beef sashimi - pretty good; wouldn't mind ordering this again; don't eat entirely raw beef much but it's not bad here  Kakimayo - basically rockfeller style oyster with cheese; not bad; I always like oysters but prefer them raw for the most part; wouldn't mind ordering this again; some oyster volumes didn't seem to reflect to the correct shells. was looking forward for a large hunk of oyster meat but didn't   Unagi Doria - Eel fried rice - pretty good but very skimpy on portion of eel meat; basically became mushrrom and cheese fried rice once all the eel was gone; would not order this again due to lack of eel meat present in this dish  Pork belly steak - smoked pork belly; it was mediorce; not as tender as I was hoping for; would not order this again;  Salmon Natto Yukke - raw egg mixed with chopped salmon sashimi and other vegetables - looked so gross; never ordering this again; when they mixed it; looked like vomit; (refer to picture) it was okay tasting but was NOT appealing to eat at all..  Tofu cheesecake - it was mediorce; just was curious how it'd taste like; I'd just stick to regular cheesecake  Definitely overhyped and not worth the hour plus wait. Food was just okay. environment was pretty lively and amazing though but would not come back here."}
{"text":"Not bad.  Went here for a first date.  Food was average, service was good, fun vibe (loud)."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Friday as soon as they opened because I heard it can get busy. I guess lunch isn't as popular because we're one of only three groups eating there at the time. Maybe that's why I liked the atmosphere. People say it's energetic and loud and fun, but it was chill and relaxed when we ate.  We ordered takoyaki, miso ramen, karaage don, fried brie, gyu carpaccio, salmon tataki, and calamari. I love the tapas style dining and each dish was incredible. My favorites were the brie and the calamari. I loved the spicy ketchup. I want to come back and try more because my family, who I ate with, don't really like Japanese food."}
{"text":"Fun experience! Food is expensive but so are all Izakayas in Toronto. Loud dining experience but creates an authentic feel. Great service but often long wait. Food is great and unique! Tapas styled portion sizes perfect for sharing and foodies who want to try everything! Fun with smaller or large parties. The whole restaurant goes wild for birthday call outs!"}
{"text":"It's a tapas kind of restaurant, different Japanese food for people who are willing to try new things. Personnel was friendly! Don't forget to order the sake bomb hahaha"}
{"text":"Before stepping into here I never expected it to be a snack bar.  But I have to say it was worth it.    Walking into the place already hooks you in with a warm welcome from everyone and I mean EVERYONE working there.  It's a cozy place with a fun atmosphere, people everywhere and filled with chatter.    When it comes to the food, every dish is so good.  If I could pick 2 dishes I'd definitely say their deep fried brie cheese and gyu carpaccio (beef sashimi basically) at first I found the idea of deep fried brie strange, but taking a bite of that was the best thing that's ever happened to me.  Picture a deep fried looking cheese slice but biting to get a perfect crunch and feel hot cheese gushing out with a sweet raspberry sauce overwhelming your mouth? Perfect.  Didn't see brie the same way after that it was so perfectly made and it was just so fresh.  The carpaccio is something I'd always get at any sushi restaurant if they had it and ordered it since I knew I'd like it regardless.  But let me tell you this, the garlic chips and wasabi mayo made a huge difference.  The chips went along perfectly with the beef and you get a slight sting from the wasabi mayo which blends all the flavours perfectly, who knew it could get any better? I ended up fighting with my friend over who gets the last piece.    I still end up coming every few months but what makes me take off one star is how expensive everything is.  If I could afford it I'd order the whole menu but almost every dish was $7-9 and the portions weren't big either so don't expect to grab dinner here but a simple snack.  Overall it's a unique experience with delicious food for anyone."}
{"text":"This is a fun and energetic place to go for dinner. Plan to experience the following:   1. 30-45 minute way in line, outside the restaurant with a bunch of foodies like yourself.  2. Loud energetic greetings when you enter the restaurant 3. Continous loud energetic yelling from all the staff everytime a new guest enters or leaves 4. Super duper yummy, I want to come back again for more Japanese tapas dishes.   We ordered:  1. Special of the day: Grilled avocado and prawn topped with mayo and panko crust -- This was one of my favourites, savoury avocado melting in your mouth, following by a small bite of shrimp.  2. Karaage -- This dish actually did not stand out much so probably won't get this next time.  3. Ikapiri (Deep fried calamari with spicy ketchup and wasabi mayo) -- If you like sweet, spicy and slightly sourish fried calamari, this is the dish for you.  4. Kakuni (Miso braised pork belly with boiled egg) -- Very similar to a chinese dish we often order in Malaysia called \"Tong Poh Pork\" - cooked in almost the same way with a boiled egg - also yummy.  5. Hotate Butter (Pan fried scallop with soysauce and garlic butter) -- this was also another popular hit. The scallop was preety tasty and they even half the regular 3 pieces of scallops into 6 pieces to accomodate our party of 6. 6. Grilled Saba (Mackerel with garlic, lemon, herb on veggies) - This was also a hit, especially with the herb and veggies.  7. Tontoro (Grilled Pork cheek with salt and Yuzu pepper) - A little bit chewey, but you can taste the marination once you bite into the meat.  8. Gindara (Grilled black cod with miso and white wine sauce) -- This is one of those other dishes that melts in your mouth and is so easy to eat that you don't mind going back for 2nds, except you realise it's all gone coz everyone else got to it before you did!  :)  9. Karubi (Grilled baby beef ribs with salt and pepper) -- This dish was Ok 10. 2 Yakiudons - These were also the hit of the night, the yakiudon must be laced with some magical potion - the noodles were cooked just right and it was coated with not too much gravy, but enough and so tasty and you keep eating it and eating it and wanting to eat it more -- which justified our ordering it again!  11. 2 Kinoko Cheese Bibimbap -- This must have been prepared by the same wizard who created the yakiudon, again, a simple looking dish served in the hot stone bowl, but once you mixed all the ingredients in it, you can smell how it will be and then taste how good it actually is - also another dish that we ordered again - just coz it was  so damn good.   One thing to note, this restaurant seems to adopt the Fish principle that they have at the Seattle Fish Market - which means a lot of yelling when customers enter, when they leave, when an order is ready, when the staff wants to communicate anything - so be prepared for a loud and energetic environment.. it was kinda fun because at some point, our group started yelling \"Welcome\" and \"Goodbye/thank you\" whenever other guests came into the restaurant too.. :D   All in all, the experience here was very good and we will defintely be back next time i'm out in Toronto.   If you have a large group, come at least 15 minutes prior to the restaurant opening (5pm).."}
{"text":"It's good. But not *that* good. Not good enough to wait for two hours. Definitely not good enough to wait for two hours when it's cold outside. If you're going to do the no reservation thing, at least have a phone/text system to alert people.   The food is really reasonably priced. And there are lots of interesting items on the menu - but nothing that made me feel that the super long wait that I endured was worth it.   I'll give it another shot when the 2nd location is open."}
{"text":"Kinka Izakaya Original does indeed taste like it would be OG.  It is five stars in my book because everything from the food to the ambiance was deserving of it.  What stood out the most was that the workers were extremely loud, but not in an annoying way.  It is part of the restaurant experience.  You will hear them yelling from the moment you walk in to the moment you order to the moment you leave.  Do not be alarmed; they are not mad at you.  In fact, they may be having the time of their lives at work.  And also, in fact, you may end up enjoying the loudness.  The drinks were delicious and strong.  The food was diverse and reasonably priced.  I would highly recommend coming here if you are around the area.  Make a reservation if possible."}
{"text":"What you can expect from Guu Izakaya authentic Japanese (run by actual Japanese owners) are tapas-style plates that are aggressively priced.  In addition to that, the vibe and atmosphere that Guu exudes is second to none as their interior design is done by the same firm that put the prominent Pan-Asian cuisine chain, Spring Rolls on the map.  The energy is amazing in this venue as it's filled with wide-eyed patrons excited to try out their dishes.  Dishes span from $4 for their appetizers to about $11 (max) for their premiere dishes.  As for drinks, half pints are reasonably priced at $5 while their \"Mega-Pints\" go for $10 but will definitely fill you up in addition to the list of sakes and shochu's that they offer. When I went with my friend, we literally ordered half of the menu just because everything was so damned tasty!  The end result of our bill?  Roughly $80 including taxes and tip.  If you're looking for a new spot in Toronto to check out and getting a bit tired of the uninspired sushi restaurants that are littered across every major Toronto neighbourhood, Guu Izakaya is a MUST destination to explore while on a date."}
{"text":"I love the bamboo drink ~~! it was cute the first time I ordered it and then I just always order it everytime for our alcoholic beverage.   The atmosphere is really not as \"conversation friendly\" simply b/c the environment is loud with lots of yelling from the whole restaurant team (as you know, they cheer when someone enters and leaves the restaurant or they may say motivational cheers to each other throughout the dinner).   But I would still bring visitors and friends here just to experience the different vibe that this restaurant has.   Suggestion:  I did enjoy being able to sit outside on the patio on a summer's day. It was awesome because it was finally quiet and we still have the same service and attention."}
{"text":"I went here on back-to-back Saturdays, and by now most of you know the wait time but thats why my friends go to Bulldog Coffee (close 7pm sharp!, said the barista) while we wait if we went early evening times.  First experience really SPOILED me because I was seated at the bar in front of the open kitchen! I am sorry to say this if my friends are reading, but at the cost of not able to chat with my friends along the bar it was an amazing experience watching the kitchen team do there magic in-sync.  It really was a SHOW on display.  I saw one fry Karaage and Takoyaki, Battered Banana, another grilling Black Cod and brushing Miso sauce while heating up Bibimbap stone bowls.  Another guy pan frying Udon, and digging out Oden from a warm box.  I just sat their with my mouth open, nose in overdrive and my eyes going side-to-side as if it was a tennis game trying to absorb all the ACTION.  Every dish they put in front of me, I wanted to take a piece and try it but within seconds a wait staff would be next to me to take it away for another patron... What a tease!  Oh yeah, BTW the food was simple & enjoyable just how it should be.  As you know, I sat where the wait staff was collecting dishes so one memory I had was that in the small sitting area at the bar one of the staff was collecting food on my right side so I turned to my left and saw another holding a cup of hot tea.  It felt like I was in Tokyo and I was making myself sit straight and not move to avoid hitting the wait staff or whatever they were holding.  My second experience was at the large communal table, which by now you can imagine it is not the same experience as at the bar area.  You would think that means this time I had more chatting time with my friends, but the whole place was rocking like a downtown club and I couldn't hear a thing or maybe I am just getting old.    I didn't get to chat with my other 8 friends, but the couple that sat next to me seemed like they were having a great conversation.  I guess when you wait so long just to get inside, you can't be picky with where to sit and who sits beside you.    Next time I am going with ONLY ONE friend so we get sit at the bar and since the bar area has faster turnover anyways, am I correct?"}
{"text":"Always crowded. Make a reservation if you can! It gets really loud and rowdy here - a very lively atmosphere. Grab a big mug of beer (1 liter) and join in on the fun!  Everything we had was okay... not stellar. The most interesting thing we ate was the deep fried brie. Izakaya joints usually have small portions, but I felt like these were smaller than normal and pricier."}
{"text":"The karaage is the best! So tender and flavourful. I like the atmosphere too. Very Japanese.  : p"}
{"text":"Meh, nothing special other than the cheerful atmosphere. The food is just alright, but if you are looking for a cozy fun place to dine, this one fits the description."}
{"text":"As you walk in, the place is much bigger than I expected and a lot louder than I thought lol The ambiance is fun and very pub like, the food is very tasty but a bit on the pricey side.  I had the ketchup calamari, and the clams with the cheese and broccoli, SOO GOOG, I also had the octopus balls but they weren't that great.  VERY GOOD FOOD.  GREAT FIRST TIME EXPERIENCE. Not necessarily willing to this all the time, but its a very nice change and lovely new interesting foods to try.  LOUD! and the seats are pretty small and jammed up close with everyone else.  its a bit crammed and you can tell they try to fit a lot of people at one time.. but sometimes its just too crowded."}
{"text":"Tried the teasing menu. Some dishes were good - salmon, miso fish, ice cream but most of them (6 out of 9)  lacked any resemblance to Japanese cuisine and were just disappointing. The atmosphere is nice though. Would come back for a drink and a snack not really for the food."}
{"text":"I took my grandson to this place to celebrate a successful year at school. Upon arrival we were greeted (yelled at) in a friendly and welcoming manner. The service was great, the food was delicious (except for the squid but that was personal taste) the prices reasonable.  We were able to sit on a shady, peaceful patio.  The timing between dishes was perfect. Would definitely return to enjoy again..."}
{"text":"Guu is a true izakaya !   I was invited by a fellow Yelper to join a UYE at Guu this evening. For a Tuesday night, it was ridiculously busy. Apparently tonight was relatively calm compared to other nights in the week. They open at 5:30 every night and you can't call ahead of time for a reservation so it's basically a free for all for places to sit.  The decor of the place is awesome ! It's eclectic and I haven't seen a place like this in Toronto yet. As mentioned by other Yelpers, the dining area is really, really loud... like a bar. If you're planning to go out for a quiet dinner, while having an amazing conversation, avoid Guu. On the other hand, if you don't care... you're good to go. It's nice to see the staff greet customers with such enthusiasm; however, it would be nice if they toned it down just one notch. In spite of this, the food was fab !  For starters, I ordered the Sakegria ... a Sangria, but with Sake. In my glass, there was one lychee and finely chopped fruits (pears, apples). Maybe it needs more of juice? I found the drink to be too strong and didn't enjoy it. I had to order a cold Oolong Tea to clear my pallet.   We ordered: - Takowasabi (ocotopus w wasabi, a Japanese mustard) - Karaage (fried chicken) - Nasumiso (eggplant in miso paste) - Okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake w cabbage) - Ikapiri (hot sauced squid) - Yakiudon (fried udon)  All selections were delicious... however, I found the Ikapiri (squid w/ chili sauce) a little too hot. The Nasumiso was the best that I've ever had as the eggplant wasn't stuffed with miso paste. The Karaage was also great ... it's close second to my mum's karaage. The chicken was tender with a lot of flavour. We ended up ordering two plates.  To end our meal, we ordered the Cheesecake of the Day... Ramune (Japanese cider) Cheesecake. It was so, so, so goood!!  Yay, I'm a fan !"}
{"text":"My new favorite Restaurant in the whole word. My friend took me here last night because i am visiting in Toronto & he said that i had to go there because it was an experience. And what and experience it was. While waiting in the hall way for the host you hear loud music like a club & please talking really loud. But once you peak inside the fun starts. Every guest that walks in the whole staff greats them by yelling something in japanese.   Once we sat down i didnt think they could have the best of both worlds with the cool ambiance. & good food. Surprise, surprise the food was amazing!!!!!!! Its all tapas style, which i love because u can try so many different plates. We started with the octopus croquettes, oysters filled with spinach&cheese and the pork. Wooooooow! Beautiful! Second round we had the soy sauce deep fried chicken, deep fried Bree & some veggies. And last but not least an amazing plate of noodles with beef :) yummmmm  Once we asked for the bill, thats when i got scared because i knew we ordered a lot & we had 3 beers. I was planing on paying so i gathers my courage and looked at the bill. What???? It was basically free! Omg!!! So cheap. I cant get over that!!!!  I paid with a big smile on my face not only because the male waiter almost died when he say my hello kitty bank of america card."}
{"text":"5 stars for me!   This place used to be called Guu and it was one of my favorite places to eat in Toronto, for sure. I (falsely?) heard that Guu was closing so I hadn't ate there since 2013. When I found out that it still exists as KINKA, it was like finding my long lost super cool cousin. I had to to try it out, also cause I wanted to reminiscence my time in Japan. :D  I'm glad to see the place stayed true to its roots of that happy/positive type vibe. That being said, let me tell you. If you are trying to to eat somewhere that's quiet and calm and no yelling, this is not the place you go to. In Japan, Izakayas are like informal pubs for people to drink and eat. This place gets louuud, and it's awesome. Took my girlfriend and they did the birthday song cheer, it was hilarious. I wish they would've put the octopus hat on her lol!    Now to the food...I got the kinoko bibimbap, SHEESH it was good. Get that, seriously.  The kimchi udon was on point as well, nice texture to the udon. I also got the bbq tako balls, the insides were super hot, almost burnt my tongue. So careful if you get those! Delicious though!    This place can get expensive simply cause the portions are on the smaller side  (that's how it is in Japan) and it's so good you'll want more. So be prepared to splurge lol. They get really busy in the evening so make sure to reserve a spot.  Can't wait til I'm back!"}
{"text":"It's become a go-to for everything from birthdays to mom-dates (moms need to be able to handle noise). The food is consistently good, the service is consistently good (and energetic), and the beer is consistently cold (and affordable). Few places in the city offer the universal appeal of Guu."}
{"text":"This place has a strong ambiance that leaves a lasting impression. The food is fresh and has tons of flavour. The service was alright though could have been a bit better. The location was really convenient since walking distance from my hotel. They scream when you enter so be prepared that it means \"welcome\" and that you aren't being yelled at haha"}
{"text":"Best izakaya in Toronto and for Japanese food. Tons of variety. My recommendation would be you must get the deep fried pumpkin, baked oyster, beef udon and the bimbibap- the one with cheese and sewed- i could eat one on my own. The atmosphere is very different from all the other restaurants. When you come in you are welcomed, super loud. The only reason why i did not give it 5 stars is because the wait time to get a table on the weekends. There is no reservations and you would also need to pay for parking on top of that."}
{"text":"This restaurant was really cool. The atmosphere was loud and exciting so if you're looking for something upbeat this is the place. The food was awesome too. We got 5 dishes and a dessert. The salmon sashimi and fried calamari were the best versions of those dishes I'd ever had. Also if you want dessert the tempura fried bananas with coconut ice cream was awesome."}
{"text":"Kinka (formerly Guu) had a very upbeat and entertaining atmosphere, making it the perfect place to go for dinner and drinks with my small group. This was probably one of the loudest restaurants I've ever been to - while it was a lot of fun for us and suited the occasion that we were celebrating, I would not recommend it if you are looking for something more intimate where you can hear every word the person in front of you is saying.   The food was pretty great, but it would definitely make more sense to come to this place if you have at least a handful of people to share dishes with. That way, you can try a little bit of everything. Every item that I got to try was uniquely delicious and had so much flavour to it. I really liked the eel fried rice and the takoyaki. They also have an awesome drink menu (lots of neat girly drinks as well as sake) so you really want to check that out. I loved the lychee mojito!  I'd specifically suggest coming here for your birthday. The workers are extremely energetic and lively as they sing and dance the birthday song to you. They certainly know how to make you feel special!"}
{"text":"My beautiful girlfriend, who introduced me to this wonderful restaurant, warned me not to waste the few opportunities I have to be audible at Guu. It was a joking retroactive reference to what I believe was a stupid joke or a lame story, but either way it is solid advice to be heeded. Don't come here expecting to have a conversation. DO come here to eat crazy delicious plates.  I have nothing to add that hasn't already been said, save for a few tips:  1. Be early, or late, unless you're okay with waiting. Seriously, just plan for a meal at 530 or 830. Or be a twosome (or solo) and sit at the bar.  2. Every dish is delicious, but I personally love the Natto Yukke (salmon sashimi mixed with 'seven friends' and served with seaweed for you to wrap it in) the Takoyaki (deep fried octopus balls) and the Ikapari (calamari in spicy ketchup sauce).   3. The mixed drinks are always awesome. I tend to gravitate to the Ramune cocktails because I find punching the ball into the bottle oddly satisfying.  4. You can't go wrong with Tataki."}
{"text":"Came to Kinka Izakaya Original on a warm and sunny Sunday night, and was lucky enough to grab two seats on the patio.  We remembered that it filled up very quickly, especially that patio, so we came right as soon as it re-opened for dinner, at 5pm, and were surprised to find that several parties were already waiting. No worries, we got seats real quick.  We started by ordering the bamboo sake. For $27, you get this great big bamboo container and these cute little bamboo cups, and this lasted for our entire 2 hour stay, so it's an amazing deal if you're looking to have some great sake with your meal.  We ordered a lot of food.  We ordered: hamachi sashimi, amaebi (sweet shrimp) sashimi, salmon belly carpaccio, lobster carpaccio, hotate (scallop) carpaccio, BBQ pork belly, kakimayo (baked oysters), okra tempura, unagi doria, and salmon natto yukke. For dessert, we had the baked matcha green tea cheese cake, and the banana tempura.  The hamachi and amaebi sashimi came out first, shortly followed by the salmon belly, lobster, and hotate carpaccio. The freshness of the fish and shellfish used was extremely apparent, especially in the sweet shrimp, which is always such a treat to have sashimi style. We were also told that if we wanted, we could have the heads from the amaebi deep fried, and you can bet that we opted for that. What we received was a little bowl with fried shrimp heads that were crunchy and sweet and salty, and we really enjoyed that. Be sure to give that a try if you get the amaebi!  The BBQ pork belly and kakimayo followed shortly. While the BBQ pork belly is good, I don't think I've ever come to a Kinka Izakaya and not ordered the kakimayo. The baked oyster covered in spinach, mushrooms, garlic mayo, and cheese is just... so comforting and delicious, that it's always the standout of my meals, even though I've had it so often. Such a treat.  The okra tempura is quickly becoming a regular favourite of mine as well. I'm a big fan of okra, and having it deep fried tempura style is such a treat. Definitely recommend it if you're looking for something salty and savoury, with the unique textures that okra brings to the table.  Unagi doria was a brand new thing for me, but I am glad we got it. I love, love, love unagi, and having it on top of rice with mushrooms and cheese was very tasty. Will definitely order again the next time I'm there.  One of our last dishes of the night was salmon natto yukke. If you've never tried natto before, I will have to warn you that the texture and mouthfeel is very unique and turns a lot of people off. Not us though, we love natto. The dish came to the table and our server asked if she could mix it for us, and we said of course. The resulting dish looks a tad on the unappetizing side, but we spooned it onto squares of nori, and just loved every bite.  For dessert, we had the banana tempura and baked matcha green tea cheese cake. Both were excellent desserts, and a really great way to end off our massive meal.  Overall, I had a fantastic experience at Kinka Izakaya. Our food was excellent, our drinks never needed refilling (750mL of sake for two!), and our service was friendly and quick.  Can't wait to come back for more."}
{"text":"This place is so fun! I first heard about it on Vice's Munchies show and had to try it out for myself. I've been here multiple times (at both locations) and the staff at both are very cheerful and welcoming. When you walk in, you will be greeted by the chefs at the open kitchen and all the floor staff - it's super cute.  The special menu changes every month(?) but are usually selections of fresh seafood and market veggies. From the permanent menu, my favourite dishes are the baked oysters, takoyaki, and fried chicken.   The sake selection is meh, but the beer is quite cheap when compared to other izakayas."}
{"text":"Le restaurant offre des plats de style isakaya (petit plats japonais). Je vois recommande  de prendre des plats de leur menu du jour écrit à la main. Sinon, Le ebi Mayo et le magura tataki sont toujours des bon choix"}
{"text":"Wow, haven't been to Guu in a while and I'm surprised to learn that they moved. Trying to write my review for them while I'm still able to, hopefully will get to impact some people on their new location.  Guu was a phenomenal place with delicious food in small portions. When you walk in, the atmosphere is alive, with awesome greetings to welcome you and goodbyes to thank you.   Came here three times, once for a friend's birthday. They were really nice, patient, sang the Happy Birthday song, and gave us a tent to wait in instead of standing in the freezing cold weather outdoors.  My favourites were their rice dishes, particularly the mushroom rice, of course takoyaki balls are a clasic, the raw beef is also delicious.   I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY THE NEW PLACE."}
{"text":"The food was really good. I especially recommend the hot udon dishes as they were particularly tasty. The inside part of the restaurant was very loud though so I'm glad I ate outside on the patio. I think it's a part of their vibe to be rowdy and loud but it wasn't appealing to me.   TL;DR Good food, but you'll have to yell to hear who you came with."}
{"text":"One of the best places to visit in Toronto! It is a must try for an authentic Izakaya experience. Very loud, fun and a great place to go with friends for a beer and sharing tapa style food.  Must orders: kakimayo - baked oysters with cheese, mushrooms and spinach. Salmon tataki - fresh sashimi served with ponzu sauce. Gyu carpaccio - beef carpaccio (my personal favourite). Kinoko bibimbap - mushroom rice served in a hot bowl and cheese. Kimchi udon.  Order the jumbo sized Sapporo for a good time. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Seriously awesome!  Atmosphere and staff were super fun and the food was DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"With so many izakaya's to choose from in Toronto, I still think Guu on Church street is one of the best. My favourite dishes: kinoko bibimbap (basically regular bibimbap but with cheese), ebimayo, salmon tataki. Like most izakaya, you have to order a lot to be full, so you're looking at about $25-$50 per person. A little crowded and noisy but it's a nice and fun atmosphere to dine at. I prefer the church location over the bloor location."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Great selection of food and atmosphere. Prices were very reasonable. Yuzu collins drink was so tasty. Looking forward to going back the next time we're in Toronto. Worth noting it is very loud inside so you should come expecting that kind of an atmosphere. There were several birthday parties going on and it seems like a great place to have one."}
{"text":"SOOOOO GOOD.  Especially for the price. Rather busy so be sure to make reservations or arrive early to guarantee a spot."}
{"text":"I've never been to Japan, being here made me believe in its authenticity. The servers enthusiastic and the atmosphere was fun! We even had a host beat box with style to the crowd!  Food is intended to be small and shared but man was it excellent! We had the following  3 Miso soup: My brother had said it was the best he's ever had. 3 Midori salad: large enough for 2 with a kick ass dressing and assortment of veggies so it's nice and refreshing. 2 Kaburi: awesome enough that we ordered it twice such good salty rich goodness with a little citrus punch 2 Yakiudon: the star of the evening! Such good flavour we were stuffed but had to get another... Take my word just get it! 2 Hamachi sashimi: good quality fish so it was Great!  Salmon tataki: I'm a sucker for tataki so this is obviously another star of the evening. Seared edges, Crispy garlic chips, nice light ponzu how can you not love it. Tempura banana split: try to keep room in your gut this was fairly large and sweet. 2 beers and 1 sega mojito. Total $147 (not including tip) between 4 people  Overall, this place was awesome! When I'm back in Toronto I will be back again."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went here for dinner while we were in Toronto for the weekend and were blown away. The food was incredible. We ordered 6 dishes to share (tapas and meant to share) We ordered the tuna tataki(incredibly fresh and flavorful) soy sauce fried chicken (best fried chicken i've ever had) fried brie (as good as the brie i've had in France) fried gyoza, beef noodles and kakimayo which were an incredibly delicious and rich take on oysters Rockefeller. We also split a bottle of Sake and a flavored beer each. (Ginger and a berry one) The bill came to just over 100 Canadian and we left stuffed and very happy. The atmosphere is also fun but do not come here if you're expecting a quiet date night!"}
{"text":"LOVE IT.  Japanese food itself is already delicious and impressive and Guu takes that to another level!  When you first walk in, you're loudly greeted by something (friendly i think!)  in Japanese by chefs and servers. The interior is really nice, I love the warm and lively vibes it gives off. The patio chairs and tables are quite tiny, but they had just the right amount of room surprisingly!  The servers all seem to speak fluent Japanese and takes your order in japanese. Everything seems as authentic as it can get! I ordered the Fried Brie Cheese first, which was AMAZING. The berry sauce accentuates and lightens the dish wonderfully, it's so delicious! It's nice, crisp, and the cheese just oozes! The wasabi duck was also stunning, it was so light and refreshing. There is a light hint of wasabi and I really liked how the seasoning didn't overpower the taste of the duck, it was cooked perfectly for my personal liking and was delicious. There was a whole lot of flavour in this one.   I also had tempura green bean with the green tea salt, it was okay - nothing special. The green tea salt was interesting, though. The takoyaki was amazing!! Nice and crisp, full of filling and flavour. There was also the oysters which were very good, the oysters were large and weren't overcooked at all! The Pumpkin croquette wasn't as good as I thought it would be, it was pretty simple but still delicious nonetheless. Just not as exciting and I think the egg was a little overcooked. The Yaki Udon was good but not spectacular, it was very saucy and the noodles were nicely cooked. The Yukke was interesting, I've never had it before and all of the ingredients when eaten by themselves was pretty unpleasant in my opinion. It was bitter and left a bad taste in the mouth but when combined with the egg yolk, it was quite pleasing actually!   Last but not least, for dessert I had the fried banana. I love fried bananas and I order them every time if I can, Guu did not disappoint. Although I am not a fan of coconut, this dish was pleasing and satisfying! It was nice, crisp, and sweet! They also give you grapes with your bill which is a nice touch!  Overall, amazing place and a definite must go whenever possible! Love the energy and food, everything is reasonably priced. Although portions are small, it's reasonable and delicious! Indeed it's Guu'd!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, fun atmosphere and great food!  My husband and I absolutely love this place. Every time we dine here we forget we're in Toronto, as it takes us back to Japan. A must place to dine at!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Japanese food - especially izakaya-style dishes. So when our original lunch plans for our first day in Toronto fell through, I immediately put Kinka on our plans.   Making a reservation is super easy online via Yelp and when we arrived around 1pm, we had our pick of tables. Waitress was super friendly and all our dishes arrived on time.   We started off with an order of takoyaki to share. Honestly, it was one of the best takoyaki's I have had outside of Japan. A+ for their takoyaki! 10/10 would eat again.   I had their salmon don lunch set, which comes with a side salad and a miso soup. BF had their gyu don lunch set, which also comes with the same sides. He couldn't decide on whether or not he wanted the gyu don or the karaage don, so we also got an order of the karaage on the side.   The lunch sets are a fantastic deal - you get a rice bowl with a side salad and a miso soup for $10 ($11 if you get the salmon). My salmon don was fresh and had so much salmon! The karaage was super moist and juicy on the inside but very crisp and crunchy on the outside.   If you're not a super hearty eater, one don and a split appetizer should be enough to fill you up. We both struggled a little bit to finish up our karaage. In the end, we had to leave behind some rice from our bowls."}
{"text":"Maybe 3.5 stars? It's fun. It's loud, has some tasty dishes, and nice drinks. Would I wait longer than 30 minutes to eat here? Nope. But to be fair, I generally don't wait anywhere longer than 20, because I get hangry.  We (two of us) came here on a Monday night around 8 PM and waited about 10 minutes; spot on, as we were told 10-15. (Warning: They do take names down to call and let you wander away, so don't make faces at people who just walk in before you.) There's a nice, spacious bench area in the front, so it was a pleasant wait. One of the groups or couples ahead of us was informed of a 90 minute time limit, but we weren't told anything.   Inside, I expected a small space, but it's even smaller than you might think.   The bar is REALLY loud. It might bug you; you might, like me, become compeltely acclimated about halfway through your meal. A lovely sake mojito -- tasty, cheap, mixed with one of those wacky marble sodas -- probably helps. In fact, definitely, if you order two. My boyfriend and I sat very close and yelled.   It's also pretty warm near the cook area (obviously). I thought I was in trouble, but I  got used to it and was fine after about 10-15 minutes.   We were passed dishes as they came from the cooks, which was fun. Watching dishes go by was half the entertainment (\"What the hell is THAT? Let's get it!\"). The deep-fried dishes came fresh yet not too hot to eat almost right away.  We ordered four dishes:   - Takoyaki: I've been wanting to try takoyaki for a long time. Almost too-tender octopus. Pretty good, but too much sauce on top (mayo?) and on the bottom. This dish was all mine, so I left two.   - Karage: Awesome. Very juicy, sauce on the side for dipping.  - Salmon tataki: Very good seared salmon sashimi. If I come here again, I'd be all over the beef carpaccio.  - Yakiudon: We got this to fill ourselves up, but it ended up maybe being our favourite surprise. It came with beef and thin slices of mushroom, and had a delicious, savoury, earthy flavour.  I've read some people complaining the portions aren't very large, but for two people sharing, the dishes were plenty.  If it's your birthday, expect the staff to don novelty shades and sing in your honour. (Man, Torontonians need to loosen up and share in the celebration with some applause. It's a birthday!)  Our bill came with two mysterious dark pods in a silver cup, which was kind of hilarious. We enjoyed poking them and realizing they were super frozen grapes.   Service was ... OK. We got little hot towels -- nice touch. Our actual server came by introducing herself and the restaurant about 5-10 minutes AFTER somebody else took our order, which was a little awkward. She was very nice when I immediately dropped and lost the opener for my soda. There seemed to be plenty of staff, but ok, the place was hopping, and constantly ferrying small dishes is labour-intensive. We didn't need much attention during our meal, so we were all right. But expect to stick around a little longer than you plan.   Our pre-tip total was about $50, which isn't too shabby.  (Before we left, my boyfriend visited the men's room, and reported a guestbook, which he of course signed: \"DOMO ARIGATO!\")"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre and the vibe is really loud. They scream Japanese at you until you leave. We sat at the bar and a waiter came by and asked if we wanted a drink. We had just been served by the bartender who also took our food order. Another waiter came by and asked if we wanted to order food. I don't think the waiters are assigned tables here. Authentic Japanese food with a very large Japanese clientele. Reminds me of Licks Burgers back in the 90's with more hostility. Not a great date place."}
{"text":"Delicious food and a lively atmosphere.  My favorite items were the fried chicken and grilled saba - the contrast of the crispiness and juiciness of both of these dishes is superb.  It's a bit on the expensive side if you go there trying to taste everything since some items aren't very filling, but if you're efficient and know what to order you can keep the cost down and be full."}
{"text":"This is a long overdue review for Guu. Every time I come to Guu I order my fav dishes and they never disappoint. I love it. Usually I order the mushroom cheese hot pot, octopus wasabi, chicken knuckles, salmon tataki, and there specials for the day. I should try other stuff since every dish I try is amazing.   The most r cent time I went, which I have never experienced this before, but they really rushes us out. I know Guu only gives you an hour and half to eat but this time we barely hit an hour and I felt so rushed by them. They even brought the cheque to us before we asked for it.   But I love the atmosphere, loud casual and great time to hang with friends to drink and have good food. Don't expect to have a sit down with a friend to have a talk one on one cuz it's really loud inside.   If it's ur friends bday tell them!! They give a great bday chant!! Lol"}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food I've had in a long time. Awesome gourmet food, comes in small portions so you can order a lot of different menu items, and reasonably priced. Great drinks as well. First time going here and loved the atmosphere, didn't know what we were walking into to, but absolutely loved it and now they greet you as soon as you come in the door.  Service was amazing and the manager that we talked too at the end of the night was so nice and great talking to and getting to know.  Not sure if he was the owner or not but highly recommend if you are visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Deep fried Brie cheese is amazing. All the dishes we tried were phenomenal. This place was so good we even stopped at the one in Montreal 4 days later. Karrage, Cheese, Calamari, Unagi Bibimbap, Salmon Sushi, Beef Salad, Pancake, and Beef Short Ribs are highly recommended. Wow this place is incredible."}
{"text":"Delicious food can't go wrong. Only negative is never come here on a first date...or maybe come here for a date if you don't wanna talk. Because it is rly rly rly loud here. If you're prone to headaches then you may want to avoid it."}
{"text":"This hidden gem at Church and Gerrard has really earned a name for itself. Although moderately pricey, the quality of the food is definitely worth the price! There are no reservations available and you have to wait in line like everyone else. For us on a Saturday night, we waited for a good 1.5 hours before getting into the Patio. The atmosphere is amazing and community-like. As you walk in, you are greeted by the entire restaurant in unison. It's cozy and the decor is decent. The entire staff was highly respectful and served us promptly, apologizing even if the wait for the food exceeded their average time by 5 minutes.   Must try: 1. Salmon Sashimi 2. Cheese Bi Bam Bap  I hear the beef sashimi is awesome too, but we got cold feet upon ordering and stuck with the pancakes instead (they were basically takoyaki but more spread out in a circular shape). The waitress recommended calamari, and she definitely got an extra tip for that! The calamari sauce resembled that of sweet and sour pork, but of course had a better aroma and the calamari stayed crisp (indicating freshness)  As it was a friend's birthday, the waitress offered 7 birthday shots (which we had to pay for - $16, but it was highly entertaining to have 3 staff members come outside just to sing happy birthday and watch her take all 7 shots.)  I don't know if I would come here again, perhaps for a special occassion, but it's definitely not a regular neighborhood go-to place for me."}
{"text":"No reservations over the phone but I walked in and they asked if I had a reservation and I said I had called but was told they don't take reservations. The host said that's correct.  If that confuses you as much as me, good.  I told the host we'd be in and out quickly, he seated us and we enoyed some absolutely amazing food. Sashimi salad, spicy octopus, grilled oysters...wish we'd had more time and another stomach or two. Only potential caution is that the place is quite energetic(some might call it loud) for those who aren't expecting it, but it's a fun, lively atmosphere for most."}
{"text":"Super tasty authentic Japanese food. Not your typical Ramen or sushi fare!   This was the first time I've been to an \"izakaya\" outside of Japan. While the food was on par with the real thing, the atmosphere certainly wasn't. In a traditional izakaya the tables are all segregated so each group gets a relatively quite and private experience (i.e. with curtains, booths, or in some cases, an entire individual room for each party), whereas here, there was only one huge room with tables lined up in the middle, in addition to the bar. This means you have a good chance of sitting next to total strangers. They also make a point of being very loud by welcoming and saying goodbye to everyone coming in or out of the restaurant, not to mention the loud techno music in the background.   All that being said however, it's definitely good if you're looking for a party atmosphere and coming with a large or mid sized group of friends. Plus the food is amazing. After trying three or four of the dishes, I was convinced I could have randomly pointed to a bunch of things on the menu and still be satisfied. Don't miss the sashimi.   Overall, not a particularly authentic experience, but the food more than makes up for it, and that's what we're here for after all, isn't it?"}
{"text":"What? an Izakaya with no yakitori? and has bibimbap on the menu? obviously not the most authentic izakayas, but still taste wise was still pretty good.  I guess Im spoiled with the plethora of Izakayas in NYC, but i guess this will have to do for the Canadians.  You walk in to the restaurant, immediately a roar of workers/chefs greet you in japanese, the same happens when you exit the restaurant, which is authentic.  Still they also served their premium sake at room temperature, which anyone who knows anything about sake knows its supposed to be served chilled.  The food did save that major mistake.  We ordered the fried cartilage with yuzu pepper, unagi doria, pork cheek, age dashi tofu, and a couple others.  The pork cheek was probably my favorite.  Prices were reasonable, staff friendly and more importantly japanese.  I have not tried the other Izakayas in toronto, because I didnt have the time, just chose this place based on the amount of reviews."}
{"text":"GUUUUU much??? Within 2 months of being here, and I've been here 3 times!!! The atmosphere is clearly Japanese! REAL Japanese chefs serving REAL Japanese food, and shouting unknown remarks in REAL Japanese! I have no clue what they are saying, but they are SMILING as they shout at you, so I'll take it as a cheer! Every time I come here, I feel like I've been whisked away to Tokyo for a few hours! We ALWAYS over-indulge when we come here, eating like it's going out of style! We ordered everything!  (NO! Not at once, but between the 3 times we were here!).  FAVES  YAKI UDON - udon noodles with beef, mushroom, scallions MAGURO TATAKI - tuna sashimi w/ ponzu & garlic chips KINOKO BIBIMBAP - rice with mushrooms, seaweed and cheese melted on top KAKIMAYO - baked oysters w/ spinach, garlic, mayo and topped with creamy cheese  PRICES Appetizers :    $3-$5 Menu Items:  $6-$10 Dessert:          I didn't bother looking! =P  DRINKS We went with kid-friendly drinks ... GUAVA JUICE - The guava juice was tasty without being overly sweet! GUU ORIGINAL RAMUNE - if you want a moment of exotic adventure, try the GUU ORIGINAL RAMUNE, a $3.50 worth of fizzling fun!   DESSERT GREEN TEA ICE-CREAM I go for the green tea ice-cream every time!  The green tea ice-cream was e-x-a-c-t-l-y how I like it, very creamy without drowning the green tea matcha flavour!  BLACK SESAME ICE-CREAM o-m-g!!! Decadent, creamy, smooth as silk ... you just have to try it for yourself! ;)"}
{"text":"This place is a blast.   The food is awesome and interesting. The environment can get a bit loud, but it's the perfect start to a night out. Sapporo is a great session beer, so drink up those suds and enjoying some perfectly prepared pork belly!!!  This is the best Izakaya in the city methinks."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant a little over-priced (although understandable given its downtown Toronto) for the quality of food served. While everything looked pretty, nothing knocked my socks off from a flavour perspective.  Kinka Izakaya is quite loud, although I enjoyed the atmosphere and high energy level of all staff. I wasn't as pumped when a server spilled part of my freshly poured beer, apologized briefly, and quickly disappeared leaving me with the task of cleaning it up; I'll give her the benefit of the doubt that she was new or just overly busy.  I had the 9-course taster menu, and wasn't blown away by any of the courses. I found many of them over-sauced. Again, decent food, but left more to be desired.  For me personally, the restaurant didn't live up to the hype I've heard about it."}
{"text":"THis is the real deal. I've been to real Izakaya and would go back to this one.  Very nice place, people and really good food.  Took the kids who also enjoyed the food.  The music is loud but its basically on a college campus and I am old."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came to visit Toronto from out of town and was recommended this place from our local tour guide. We had such a fun time eating at Kinka Izakaya! We loved all the small plate options offered. We ended up with the Beef & Tuna Sashimi, Baked Oysters, fried chicken and beef noodles...all scrumptious. The high energy of the staff here made this place such a great experience for us and we'll come back again when we're in Toronto!"}
{"text":"When you first step into the restaurant, all the employees will yell out a warm greeting. It's a lively, noisy and fun experience.   Aside from the friendly atmosphere, the food was really really good. I've never had fried Brie cheese before but I definitely recommend the dish if you like cheese.  Overall, a great time with great food."}
{"text":"Went there during my Bday.  Loud but the food was sooo yummy.  The service was great and entertaining.  They did the rice spoon twirl so fast it was hypnotic  I can't wait to go back again but with ear plugs?  We order the dinner combo to get a taste of everything and birthday package.   Tip: Small place so go early if you want to avoid crowd"}
{"text":"Service was great and staff were friendly! Their salmon tataki was AMAZING. Then again I have a bit of a bias towards seared seafood. Their seafood was very fresh. I also had the calpico sour and that was super refreshing. Their chicken karaage came in big pieces but I prefer smaller pieces. We also had that oyster thing, and one oyster was full of cheese but the other had very little of it. Food came at a good speed. I'd recommend here for a memorable experience and an interesting date night but if you want to talk, you may want to go to a quieter place."}
{"text":"It's crazy here. Loud music..people screaming in Japanese and we even got a beat box rap show along with a really fun dance show..BTW the food was pretty good too.  This place is Japanese party tapas pub so be prepared to eat really good small plates and be exhausted before you leave.   It's a lot of fun but for me only in small doses."}
{"text":"The food was alright.  A bit hyped up with food just drizzled in mayo and teriyaki sauce.  It's fun to experience the loud izakaya atmosphere but not a pleasant dinner experience when you can't hear the people you went to dinner with.  The service is kinda meh as they just want you to eat and get out.  It's filled mostly with young Asian girls and their dates; not sure I'd return for a $8 5-piece sashimi - fushimi near by has better presentation and food."}
{"text":"I've probably been here 20+ times now and this restaurant always delivers. It's my favourite restaurant in Toronto. The atmosphere is casual and loud in a nice energetic way. The food is amazing and very creative. It's nice to have a casual, non-pretentious restaurant where the food is top notch. Come as you are, no need to dress up.  The chefs are amazing and it never ceases to amaze me how they come up with these amazing dishes. It can get pricey but you absolutely get your money's worth. Every single time I've left happy. I can not recommend this place highly enough as a unique fun experience, whether you're local or visiting Toronto and looking for a fun and unique dining experience."}
{"text":"I was skeptic about whether Guu could possibly live up to the hype. I grew even more skeptical as I stood outside Guu for 30 minutes in the rain without an umbrella, waiting for a table before the restaurant opened. And when my partner and I were finally seated, amid all the yelling and fanfare from Guu staff, I had relegated Guu to the cabinet in my mind that contains eat-er-tainment restaurants like Benihana: all show, no substance.  ...and then I tried the food. And then I realized I was all wrong.  It's good. It's seriously, seriously good. Not only does the energy and activity from the kitchen provide a nice feast for the eyes, but the food is definitely a feast for the soul. I especially loved the Scallop and Enoki Mushroom. It's wrapped in bacon. It's amazing. Order multiples, you're going to want more -- trust me.   Even though the place was completely packed, service was still great. I'm definitely going back soon to try more dishes."}
{"text":"just as how i remembered guu used to be. cute creative food, small portion tapas, interesting experience - fun over all!  nothing is super memorable but all the dishes we had were quite pleasant on the palate."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was loud and energetic. I had 6 tapa size dishes that was delicious and fulfilling. I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I booked this place for me and 5 coworkers. The reservation on a Monday night was a breeze and I was able to push it back by 30 minutes without a problem. It had a fun and loud vibe - but definitely a little too loud since we literally had to shout over each other to be heard. Most of the food was good but maybe an inappropriate choice if you're trying to have any kind of conversation that doesn't involve yelling... I would consider trying the Montreal location with some friends."}
{"text":"Never thought I'd give the king of izakayas only 2/5 stars, but it truly was a mediocre experience last night for dinner.   Important tip: make an online reservation days ahead of time especially if you have a party over 3-4 people since space does fill up! You can also only be there for 2 hours and while they won't enforce that strictly (we stayed a bit over time) they did remind us at least twice upon arrival, so I think they try to take that rule seriously.  Venue- 1/5. AHHH WAYYY TOO LOUD. Forgive me for perhaps being uncultured, but I think there's a difference between providing a fun, rowdy, happy-hour Japanese style experience versus deafening your clientele and making it impossible for them to hear their friends sitting next to them. I prefer a quieter izakaya experience and maybe that's not as authentic, but my friends and I had such a difficult time chatting over the yelling. Otherwise, beautiful interior design (traditional style) with long communal tables and self coat check at the entrance to save space.  Food- 3/5. This was where Kinka lost stars for me. Having been to Kintaro Izakaya just a week ago, I had high expectations for izakaya food. Unfortunately, while the dishes at Kinka were tasty, I thought they paled in comparison to Kintaro. Anything with tempura here looked and tasted cheap and effortless, like they came frozen from a box. i especially would not recommend the deep fried chicken here... You can get better fried chicken at so many other places, including your own kitchen, and the batter to chicken ratio was so sad. I ordered the salmon natto yukke ($9.8) for myself because I wanted something low carb, high protein (salmon sashimi and raw egg), and high fiber (many different types of vegetables including natto/Japanese radish and okra), but since it was a cold dish the flavor felt a bit off/bland after mixing in the raw egg. I didn't enjoy this dish. I would highly recommend their Kinoko bibimbap - I tasted my partner's and absolutely fell in love with the flavor!! Very umami. The sashimi here is also very fresh. Like at any izakaya, the portion sizes are small, including the bibimbap.   Value- 3/5. Can't talk about the dishes without discussing the price. Between the 5 of us we spent ~$64 without tips, which is really excellent except keep in mind that none of us ordered alcohol and 3 of my friends pre-ate, so didn't eat very much here. The dishes at Kinka are slightly more expensive than at Kintaro Izakaya (also in this area, one of my favorites), but not as costly as at Kingyo, for example.   Service- 4/5. Very friendly servers, but probably understaffed given the high customer volume here. Getting our waters and getting them refilled took a while. Some of the dishes, including the salmon natto yukke, took over 20 minutes to come.  In summary, I probably won't be coming back due to the noise level and disappointment with some of the dishes. I think there are better izakayas in Toronto."}
{"text":"Delicious! So many good items!!!  Things I loved: 1. Tuna tataki  2. The eel dish 3. Hotate (Scallops) 4. Chicken Karage  Each one of those items above was awesome! The tuna tataki had premium cuts of sashimi grade tuna, smooth as butter and lightly marinated to add a hint of flavor. The eel and rice place definitely hit the spot, and is a great dish for any eel lover out there (I'm a big fan of eel). The Hotate was super enjoyable since the scallops tasted really fresh.  And the chicken karage... yea... quite possibly the best chicken karage I've had in some time. Deep fried to perfection with extremely flavorful and juicy chicken meat on the inside. Simply amazing.  Definitely recommend this place if you're in the Toronto area. Great Izakaya.  Just remember, there will be a LONG wait on their busy nights."}
{"text":"#1 best izakaya in the GTA apparently, and I can see why. However, I do believe this restaurant is SEVERELY hyped. I guess I was too excited to go- we had to make reservations, because if you don't... guess you're not eating there today!  The atmosphere is what makes it so popular.  When you go in, you are greeted loudly and throughout the entire course meal, they are constantly loud and yelling in japanese, to create the atmosphere of a real izakaya in Japan. If you're into that, this would be your place. I guess I'm too much of a grandma, or I enjoy eating in peace- I'd get half scared to death when my server would just randomly start chanting loudly in response to the other workers in the middle of serving me. You can yell, but yell away from me please. It was too loud, and I couldn't talk to my friend at all.  The food is very fresh and indeed delicious. However, I do believe it is slightly overpriced because the portions are way too small. A good piece of advice is: eat a bit before you come, or else it's going to take a lot of $$$ to fill you up.  I really liked the octopus wasabi sidedish; it had just the right amount of wasabi. So yummy! The other food was delicious too, however not as memorable. The alcoholic drinks are also very interesting, I've never had drinks such as these but they're pretty good! Definitely worth a try.  The seating is very cramped, and the place is not big. I hate when I have to put my bag on the floor, but I guess when it comes down to it, you gotta do what you gotta do.   Overall, it is not something I'd go to over and over again, but I definitely recommend it at least once for the experience. Maybe you'll like that type of atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great Izakaya spot. Previously known as Guu. Great atmosphere, great staff. Noisy, loud and drowns out the Nujabes and dope music but specialty drinks & food menus are on point.  Baked oyster, Kaisou Tofu salad is my personal favs. Sake/samurai bombs will get you lit.   I disliked how the server mixed my Kinoko bibimbap before i got a chance to Snap it. Regardless the menu is delicious.  Friday and Saturdays are extremely busy and usually there is a wait."}
{"text":"Food is always on point. Excellent selection of food and drink. VERY loud but super fun place to eat with friends or family."}
{"text":"On average we spend about $50/person. Food is amazing and love the atmosphere. The price is a bit expensive but i think it's worth it. At the same time some dishes are too small for the price we are paying"}
{"text":"Best Japanese restaurant in Toronto hands down. If you're looking for an outstanding atmosphere and very tasty food then check out this spot. They also have superb sake!"}
{"text":"Another place that just confirms why the food in this city is better than crack.  Why, oh why, you'd  turn to crack when you could just come here is one of Toronto's greatest mysteries. Sunday night late reservation. No problem walking in but the place gets crazy busy and a reservation probably would've been needed any other day or time. Loving the welcome. Mental note: going to ask my nurses to scream like that every time a patient walks into my clinic.   The food. Sashimi salad: probably the tastiest thing on the menu. The dressing was so good I was drinking it with a spoon later. Sashimi was delicious, texture was amazing, and such a delicious pick. Tuna tartare: very good, good portion of tuna, but not totally feeling that mango sauce that came with it. I think I'm more classic on the soy sauce with sesame seed thing but it was a good dish. Karaage: honestly, kind of like fried chicken, and not crazy Asian influenced beyond that. The mayo sauce that comes with it is good and it's really tasty but wouldn't say it had some mind blowing uniqueness to it. Gindara: really good piece of cod, but probably thought this was a bit unnecessary to order. If you're good with the other stuff, ordering the fish gets pretty unnecessary.    We got a couple of other things on the rotating menu which I can't totally remember, but the selection here is so diverse it's worth just getting a bunch of tapas and sharing it all. Super cool restaurant, and if the only complaint was that it was a bit oily, it's still a totally sick restaurant. Love the atmosphere, want to try at least everything else of the menu once, and in terms of the atmosphere, food quality and selection, hands down this is one of Toronto's best restaurants for sure."}
{"text":"Buzzing outside was a crowd waiting, sitting on the modern wood benches, overlooking a cabbie favorite Indian restaurant.  Glass cubes previewed the glow inside from incandescent Edison bulbs hanging from the ceiling.  The atmosphere was loud, the communal tables and greetings high energy yelling Japanese.  We were thankfully seated in a normal two person table off to the right and waitress arrived; did she have available indicated on her name badge? I really hope that wasn't forced like flair on the very proficient girl.  The service was spot on; even after I dropped one chopstick quietly between me and the wall, a replacement showed up in seconds.    The food was great! The seafood takowasabi, shrimp sashimi, etc. were awesome but very very small on the portion size.  The land flesh was much better portioned, with pork cheek and beef tongue being highlights.  The hand photocopied specials menu had some great options.  Tried a taste of sakegria and it beats most of the Toronto Sangria so far.    I left with a bow and a Sayonara and D?mo arigat? as the staff gave a warning yell and in unison.... somethingorother.  Clearly one of the good ones and looking even more forward to the new location."}
{"text":"I love this place! You feel instantly welcomed by staff. Its a great spot if you want to try japanese food outside of sushi/tempura/bento boxes (although it has some of those items as well).   Drinks can get a bit pricey, but the food and service is excellent."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Wednesday with my 2 friends. The seats were 1/4 filled and it was really warm inside. There were music/songs playing and I felt that the volume was kind of loud. I ordered the Miso ramen + Gyu Carpaccio. My friends ordered the regular size Karaage Don, Gomaae, Tako Wasabi and Donburi with salmon sashimi.   I am a huge ramen lover, but honestly, I didn't appreciate the Miso ramen that I ordered. I'd rather have a ramen at near-by Kinton, Sansotei or Santouka. I usually finish most of the soup whenever I have ramen, but this time I left it half way.   As for the appetizers, I loved it. Guy Carpaccio was yummy, except that it doesn't look like the picture that has been posted on Yelp by the restaurant. I also think that it is a bit overpriced ($7.50) for 5 thin slices of beef. Tako Wasabi was good too, we could taste the octopus, and there was lots of wasabi. To be enjoyed little by little.   Donburis came with a miso soup and a side salad. Karaage Don came with pieces of fried chicken and the bowl was filled completely. My friend who had the salmon one was still kind of hungry after the meal. So if you're someone who has a good appetite, go with the Karaage Don.   Food: 3.5/5 Price: 3/5 Service: 3.75/5"}
{"text":"Amazing ambience with great energy. Oddly even though the servers are screaming in Japanese, it turns out that they are mostly all Korean! The food is decent (star: salmon tataki) with some real misses (awful bibimbap which is kind of ironic given the above)... but it's the atmosphere that is transcendent!"}
{"text":"Amazing place, the food is amazing the atmosphere is great. Will take you a bit to get adjusted to that noise but when you become part of it will appear normal. Great dishes."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place and I went in with no expectations. From the first welcome shout as I walked through the door to the last goodbye the experience was totally awesome. Love great Japanese food in tapas, love \"energetic & fun\" (I asked the waitress what's up with all the shouting and she responded that's their concept) atmosphere, love smiling people who open up to engage in conversation with strangers, love the assortment of cool drinks, and last but not least both my friend and I were pleasantly surprised by a very affordable price tag at the end of the night. Come in before 6 to avoid the lines, and definitely go - this is one of the few places that makes Toronto food scene so amazing."}
{"text":"Great food and cool experience. Go with a group and have a great time. Food is awesome and drinks are delish. Thoroughly enjoyed everything. It gets super loud in here - probably the loudest place I've ever ate at, but it totally adds to the vibe, defo not a place to bring a date if you're looking for deep conversation.  Plow through the Samurai Saki Tower - great way to start your night ;)"}
{"text":"Best place ever, great food, service and atmosphere. The takoyaki and okonomyaki were delicious. Definitely recommend and I will personally go there all the time."}
{"text":"It was my first time having Guu and it was such a great experience.  The food was great, the price is very reasonable and most of all....the atmosphere is amazing!!   Definitely check it out!!!!"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere was amazing! Probably not a good place to go if you want to talk a lot since it's fairly loud. Although the seating limit was for 2 hours, they started to rush us out after 1.5 hours so it was a bit disappointing. My friend I ordered the gomaae, Brie cheese, kakimayo, and unagi doria to share. It sounds like a lot but the portions are fairly small so we were still hungry after. We ordered the shoyu ramen to share after. Everything tasted great, especially the kakimayo. The shoyu ramen was very salty though."}
{"text":"guuuuu!!! I love it! The deep fried brie omggggg to die for. I love how everyone welcomes you and also says goodbye! It's just the nicest! I recommend getting there early or at least plan to wait a while, thankfully there are bars around the corner that you can hang out in until your table is ready!"}
{"text":"Delicious Japanese food, high energy atmosphere, and a very fun experience!  The service was exceptionally slow on the night that we went but I'm hoping it was just because they were short staffed so I'll cut them some slack.  We did one of the the course meals for 2 and loved everything that we tried.  I highly recommend that \"GYU YUKKE\" - beef tartare w/ black sesame sauce & garlic sweet soy sauce topped w/ scallion & egg yolk.  Out of all of the restaurants that we tried while we were visiting in Toronto, this was our favorite :)  Also, this place gets VERY loud and you might have to share a long table with strangers but it was a very enjoyable night nonetheless."}
{"text":"I love coming to Kinka with friends or for a date (if its the latter Ill make sure to sit outside or else you will never hear each other talk.   Overtime, we will order 2-3 dishes/person and share everything with everyone. My favourites are the seaweed tofu salad, the baked oysters (so cheesy and decadent), takowasa (lots of umphhhh) and the karaage.  Its a guaranteed fun time every time!"}
{"text":"A new absolute favourite. For me this place is one of those random discoveries that only happen every once in a while - it was a lucky day! I had been having a Curry craving for weeks and this place met all my craving needs and then some.  Perfect teriyaki sauce, meat was tender and perfectly cooked. I am still surprised that I came here with a friend during lunch hour and the place was not busy at all - we were immediately seated and service was excellent and quick."}
{"text":"Was going to go to this place until I read their laundry list of rules on their website about reservations, table sitting time and so on. I've heard the food isn't bad here however I don't eat in a dictatorship environment. Good luck with your business logic, you will lose more customers with this type of service. I was trying to email the restaurant directly regarding the dictatorship however you can't? Hmmm wonder why."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this yet? We first went to Guu in Vancouver and we already fell in love then, but when we heard they were opening a location many years ago in Toronto, we lost it.  We go here often and for good reason. The place is so much fun, and obviously the food is rockstar. We call this our \"relationship restaurant\", because we go so often and it's always that place we can both agree on when we're being fickle with choosing some place to eat.  Get the baked oysters, the shrimp & mayo, beef salad, tuna sashimi... wait, you know what? Get everything you can possibly menu. Don't listen to me. Discover Guu for yourself and find your own gems.  Guu... sooo G'uuuuud!"}
{"text":"Loved every single thing I've ordered!!! Fun fun fun atmosphere too! My fave dishes to order: Brie cheese - I know, weird but oh so delicious! Takoyaki was awesome!!!  They have daily specials, do make sure you try them!!!"}
{"text":"An immersive dining experience. I've never been to Tokyo but sure feel like I'm there when eating here. The Izakaya tradition is in full effect with boisterous welcomes and good byes shouted at full strength in Japanese by EVERY staff member whenever the door opens. The food is equally as impressive. Delicate flavours, surprising combinations, perfectly executed. The blanched greens with sesame are better than they sound. Any fish dish is how fish was meant to be eaten, especially the grilled black cod. The must-have is the Karaage fried chicken. Go once for the experience. Go again and again for the food."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere of the entire place. When you enter the restaurant, they will greet to you loudly in Japanese-style welcome. Although they greet to every customers who enter of leave, you may feel they are crazy. Its really a what a izakaya feels like.  The food is truly fantastic and the service is professional as well. We ordered deep fried chicken knees, cheese oysters (which I like the most), Udon and unagi rice. I would strongly recommend cheese oyster which tastes amazingly delicious. For the next time, I would order more side food because after around 1 hour, I felt hungry again.  Anyway, this is the place you can't miss and you want to go more than once after you tried the food there."}
{"text":"this is not japanese. i'm from japan and this is not even close! too much ice in cocktails, their \"unique\" not-very-good food, over-priced shrimp sashimi.    It was a pretty terrible experience with very loud ambient which I'm sure some people prefer."}
{"text":"always good food and always a good time at Guu! for real this place is fun, and very authentic japanese! love it!"}
{"text":"KONBAN WA?!!!  OGENKI DESU KA??!?!!  Raucous Japanese greetings will welcome (sometimes startle) newcomers to this new izakya restaurant from the Vancouver based chain so popular out West. Think tapas Japanese style.   Beautiful open space, brightly lit, lively large bar with several heavy wooden stools. Long wooden communal tables makes this a very open and modern feeling space. Love the stone facade wall. Hard to find tucked in the corner strip mall of McGill and Church but parking down along McGill is easy given the construction.  The menu isn't nearly as extensive as their franchises in Vancouver so you have to choose wisely. My notes on a few dishes...  Kabocha  - Fried pumpkin croquette with a hard broiled egg center  - interesting combination, not sure the pumpkin really works **  Agedashi tofu - Served in bite-sized cubes in a bowl - unexpected presentation, but worked well ***  Kakuni - Miso braised pork belly with a miso broth and hard boiled egg - Pork belly deliciously fat but similar to most Asian preparations **  Gindara - Grilled miso black cod - my favorite, awesome texture, cooked just to velvety  ****  Gyu tongue - Grilled beef tongue served with a light wasabi - slightly cold and dry, not too exciting **  Karubi - Grilled short ribs - tender and flavourful, not the lean cut and tasty  ***  They offer larger dishes of bibimbap or udon but I'm not sure this is the place I'd come for that.  Overall, an exciting addition to Japanese cuisine in Toronto. The service was a bit spotty (i.e. missed a dish) and authentically Japanese (i.e. speak slowly). Packed after 6:30PM so go early to avoid the wait. Don't expect a full meal, snack on a few plates, enjoy the sake and company.  ARIGATOO GOZAIMASU !?!!?  .  ---Japanese greetings translation not guaranteed"}
{"text":"We stopped here after a long day of travel because it was close to our hotel, and honestly I think I'd have rather gone to bed hungry. That's not to say that the service was bad - it was quite decent - or that the food was bad - the Midori salad was excellent, and the Kinoko Bibimbap was solid, if not as good as similar dishes I've eaten elsewhere. The sizzling bowls seemed like a good idea, although 5 minutes into your meal you realized that the bowl warmed the air near you at least ten degrees and it got uncomfortably hot. What bothered me the most about this place was the yelling. Perhaps I would appreciate it more when I was more rested, and it was cute the first time someone exited or entered and all the staff started yelling in Japanese, but the 89th time they started yelling I no longer cared and wanted to be able to talk to the person sitting across from me. Although the blaring music didn't help much in this regard either. This place is LOUD, and not recommended if you want to hold anything resembling a conversation, though the food was pretty good. Buyer beware."}
{"text":"Wow this place is good! It does live up to all the reviews here. Its well worth all the reviews here. The welcoming party is very welcoming. The service is fast and frantically. The price of food ranges from $4-$25. Each and every food item does add up so make sure you keep count after you place your orders. Our party of 3 racked a bill of $140 it was well worth it good food, good service! I would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"The place is too loud inside to enjoy a meal, servers and cooks really milk their greetings for all it's worth. It was much better outside in the patio but do not sit underneath the heater as it's much too warm. The food is pricey and the servings are not on the generous side. This is not your regular nice bowl of ramen, or sushi joint. In fact, they don't serve them here at all. They serve a lot of Japanese/ Korean fusion dishes, some of which were interesting but not memorable. On their menu, they serve a piece of grilled chicken leg (which by the way came undercooked with the insides still bloody pink ) with no sides. I did not like this place at all. Too loud, the service is slow, the prices are too steep for the little servings."}
{"text":"Firstly. From the second you step into this place the customer service is AMAZING. you are greeted by all staff. its hilariously amazing. The food... unreal. My friends and I ordered a bunch of things off the menu and we all shared (i find this to be the best experience menu wise)  The oysters covered in cheese.... by far my fav. Don't leave unless you've tried this. Atmosphere, customer service and food quality all get 5 stars from me. This is the perfect friends dinner spot or a fun date!"}
{"text":"Expect to wait an hour or two before being seated. They don't take reservations. The food is blah, their drinks are different and unique. I came for the food though. All the dishes were quite standard, tapas-sized serving portions. The staff are extremely friendly and greet you at every corner, and everytime they pass by. The decor seems nice. They managed to fit a lot of seats into a small place, and still make it work well. Personally, I do not like the food at all. I find it too normal, flavour profiling is too one tiered, textures were lacking, presentation lacked effort. I don't see what the rave about this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience!!!! Wonderful food, wonderful people, extremely polite and happy staff, just awesome! Will be ba ck vert soon."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  the energy of all the people that work here is great, you feel good as soon as you step in.  We had the bamboo sake and omg, let me tell you it was delicious, I'm not a huge fan of sake but this one was really smooth and almost sweet.  The food was great, super fresh and tasty, the beef capraccio and the oysters with spinach dip were my fav."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My friend and I have been coming here every Thursday for more than a week for the $3 sake bombs. Every time we order one, they do the whole sake bomb chant that lights up the entire atmosphere. Pitchers are a bit pricy at around $18, but the atmosphere is super lively. This place always cheers me up.   I also always get the karaage, which is similar to the one you get from Kinton (since owned by same parent restaurant), which is delicious and crispy but there's usually only 4 pieces. The salmon tataki and is delicious and fresh. If you go for your birthday, they'll have a huge board and get the entire restaurant to sing happy birthday for you, which is freaking awesome.   i've also gone for lunch for their cheap $8 shoyu ramen. It's light and the pork is kind of hard to chew, but the noodles are worth the price. They also have a delicious karaage don and I don't know why they don't offer this at kinton, but it's super good!"}
{"text":"don't even bother with this location.. music is way too loud, food is mediocre, and there is no available tables that have any level of privacy..  go to any of the vancouver locations instead and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food is here is great. The first time I tried the Guu.. i wasn't much of a fan but I gave it another try and realized that I just need to know the right things to order! I pretty much always order the same dishes whenever I come here. I always get either the maguro tataki or salmon tataki, gyu carpaccio, ebimayo, kimchi udon, kinoko bibimbap, and kakimayo. The almond tofu is actually the smoothest almond tofu ever. Good as a dessert if you don't want something too heavy. Dishes are tapas, made to share at the table and great for people who want variety and want to try a little bit of everything.  The environment in here is fun. Once you walk into the restaurant, the staff shouts and welcomes you. It is loud here so I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're looking for a quiet environment."}
{"text":"This Guu was opened awhile back and I just went recently again after all these new Izakaya restaurants were opened.  I have to say, I was very impressed with their food selections, food quality, services and the energetic environment the Guu crew shows during dinner.  You can tell almost all of them are enjoying what they are doing, and this makes this Guu still far better than the Guu on Bloor.  When I go to Guu, I will ALWAYS order the Kinoko Bibimbap, this is one of the best rice I ever had!  Other than that, I will always order the Salmon Natto Yukke.  I think both are very unique and special items only this Izakaya can master!  If you want to have a wonderful Izakaya experience, I will highly recommend Guu!  The price you are paying is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner Specialty: Japanese  Menu items: Gyu Shabu Salad, Maguro Tataki, Gindara and Kinoko Bibimbap and Otokomae cocktail  Guu Izakaya its not just a restaurant. It's a culture.  One does not head to Guu for peace and quiet or to enjoy some \"OK\" food. When I think of Guu, I think of fantastic dishes with unique taste and flavours, out of this world drinks and a crazy atmosphere; and I pretty much get on the Guu state of mind.  To get on this state of mind I speak of, one's meal must start with their signature cocktails. In my case, the Otokomae. In ancient times, Izakaya referred to places where people went to enjoy a drink and a good chat. So it is with reason that Guu Izakaya's many specialties involve some good doses of alcohol. My Otokomae drink was a delicious mixture of sake, tequila, cointreau, cassis and orange juice, which the waiter kindly advise me to squeeze in the juicer and then proceed to pour onto my drink; therefore making it that much more fresh and delish.  Guu's style is tapas inspired, so my party and I decided to share an array of dishes to truly enjoy the Guu state of mind; starting with a nice Gyu Shabu Salad.  At first glance, I thought this salad was just OK looking given its lack of ingredients, not realizing that a salad, if made well, should taste good regardless. And this was certainly one dish Guu's Chef knows how to make. This salad, on the first bite, immediately raised to the top next to Susur Lee's famous slaw. Oh yes it did! Its simple and fresh, with an explosion of flavour coming from both the shabu-shabu beef and the fantastic black sesame dressing. That combination of the dressing, with the beef, peppers and greens, was all I really needed.  Next on the order was of course a sashimi dish, tuna to be exact; also known on the menu as Maguro Tataki. The B.C tuna was incredibly fresh and tasty. This piece of fish had been lightly seared on what I bet where some oak and apple wood in the fire. I am not 100% on this, but this is what I tasted. Drizzled with Ponzu, a Japanese citrus-based sauce, and accompanied with garlic chips, this dish was one of my favourites at Guu Izakaya.  Staying on the fish food group, we followed with the Gindara. Placed, and probably cooked on what looked like a banana leaf, was a black cod that is grilled and drizzled with miso and a white wine sauce, and melted like butter in my mouth. And if I may add, black cod is my favourite fish in whole wide world, so my love for this dish is beyond words.  Lastly, and to put a nice and lovely end to our Guu culture experience, we had the famous Bibimbap. We decided on the Kinoko style which came with rice, mushrooms and cheese in a seaweed sauce. The rice, once again, hit the spot like good Japanese places usually do. This rice was just as good as that of Yuzu's, and the Bibimbap, meaning the whole dish, was better than my recently reviewed one at Seor Ak San. Seor's is still good, but its a second contender to Guu.  And so I leave you with my Guu state of mind.  Buen Provecho, Viviana,"}
{"text":"This place has left a memory that I cannot forget and that is because of the lobster sashimi. Yum yum yum. I had it way too long ago and am looking forward to another experience here!  I went with a friend when I was in town and he told me that the restaurant gets super busy so we went when the restaurant just opened. We managed to get a seat immediately, but even on a weekday, the restaurant was filled quickly after.   Lots of fun with the screaming and chanting around - so many options and I sure love a good variety when it comes to food!"}
{"text":"We got the $35 preset course which was a great assortment. Flavor was good, texture was interesting, ambiance was fun; will definitely be coming back with a group the next time I visit Toronto. Favorite dishes were the Kakimayo, Bibimbap, Gyu Shabu Salad! Must try!"}
{"text":"I called 5 days in advance to make a booking for my group at this location after hearing all the great reviews about this place. I called the restaurant on Monday as their website was down over the Thanksgiving weekend to book my group's reservation and was met with horrible service/lack of respect. The staff member who I was speaking to me seemed to not understand what I was saying even though I was speaking quite clearly. I was making a booking for 11 people, a large group. I had the specific time and date already planned out for him to record but he pretended to not hear what I was saying (playing the I don't understand English trump card) which was extremely rude because all you're recording is some basic info (name, time, phone #, date). For real how hard is that?!   This is how our conversation went:  Him: Hi welcome Kinka Izakaya what you want? Me: Hi there I would like to make a reservation for my group and I for this Saturday (Oct 14th) Him: What? Sorry? Me: I would like to make a reservation for my group and I for this Saturday (Oct 14th) Him: ..Hold on.. one second! He seemed really confused on the phone, went to ask his supervisor or whoever if they could book for such a large group and then came back and told me it was \"ok\" Me: ... ok Him: You want to make a reservation? When Me: I would like to please make a reservation for this Saturday October 14th at 7pm Him: So a reserve for Sunday? Me: No Saturday!  Ok at this point I really felt like he was just taking the piss because I had to repeat myself I kid you not 10 times. This was the same scenario when he was taking my name and cell. number. I kept having to repeat myself over and over and over. Not a great way to treat potential customers sir. I know it's not your establishment but \"your restaurant\" has a good reputation and you're just ruining it. He said sorry it's very loud and hard for me to hear but to be honest he could have asked one of his buds to help in out if he didn't understand.   I called on Tuesday to confirm that the booking was properly recorded because I was really unsure after the horrible experience I had on the phone and a staff member (I believe it was the same guy from Mon.) said it was fine. Low and behold, I get home from class in the evening and guess who I get a call from?? The restaurant. A lady was speaking this time. She was clear and explained everything to me well. She said that booking for large groups was to be done online. I told her that I had tried previously on their website but it was down and no one in my group could access the website and that's why I called in to book instead. She informed that it was up and working again and said that the staff member who I was speaking to was not supposed to make the booking over phone for a large group and that I had to book online. I thanked her for her help but I feel crappy because we obviously still don't have a reservation after all of that. I go online, and WOW it's actually working..what a surprise smh. So on their website guess what I see?!!!:  *For groups of 10 or more, please call 416-977-0999. *Your table will be held for 15 min after your reservation time. *Your seating time limit is 2 hours after your reservation time.  How many people did I say I have in my group? 11 PEOPLE  and yes this is the same number that I had been calling in too before.   Why was I being redirected to book online when it says that 10 or more people booking have to be done through phone. She said she had to cancel it and that I had to book online but online it says to call REALLY hmm.  HONESTLY!!! After all of this shit I was like FUCK THIS!!  I really don't know what the hell was going on but maybe it was a sign from God telling me not to go there. I mean obviously they don't value their customers and I know there's so many other great izakayas/places in the city anyway. It is their loss. I will not be recommending this place to anyone until I try it out myself one day and I hope that when I do actually go it won't let me down. Maybe I'll let someone else sort out the booking haha and see how they get on."}
{"text":"La nourriture est bonne mais mon dieu que c'est bruyant ! Faut aimer l'ambiance. Mais c'est super sympa"}
{"text":"The place is hip and cool and fun.  Definitely trendy.  The prices are very good.  The food is unique but not as exceptional as i expected.  This could be due to the fact that most of the dishes we wanted to order were not available.  Even the rice dishes weren't available because of the rice cooker malfunction.  This was my first time here and I will come back again with hopes of enjoying the dishes we missed the first time.  3.5 stars for now."}
{"text":"Holy fuckin hell. I mighta slipped in the snow, gotten hit by a bus, and ended up at this place. This is the first place I have ever given a 5/5, and let me tell you it deserves it! The quality of food here is ridiculously amazing and definitely worth the price. The salmon tataki exceeded my expectations, and the grilled duck breast was excellent. Also, I thought the best oysters I've ever had were from New Orleans until I tried the kakimayo here. My only regret is that I came here alone like some some creeper, but I was in the area for a business trip and don't know anyone in Toronto. Too bad since there was so much more on the menu I wanted to try, but I was pretty full by the time I finished the kakimayo.   The staff here is super friendly, and the vibe is pretty lively. You're gonna love this place."}
{"text":"Great food and cool vibe. Your greeted by the entire staff when you come in and when you leave they all say farewell.  The food was really good, Even the side salads we enjoyed. We had the lunch special which was seafood tempura and chicken in soy sauce. We were really satisfied with both dishes. They were both decent in price and filling. Not sure what the dips were for the chicken but they were my favorite thing I tasted."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place during my trip to Toronto. Very lively, can get a bit too loud (just personal preference), but it's the kind of vibe they want to give, so it's all good.   The food was a bit above average. I wouldn't call it fine dining by any means, but it's not that bad. I ended up getting a course from their party menu, which includes a set of food that come to you, kind of like omakase. Great way to get a taste of a bit of everything that they have. I also ended up getting a sake bomb, and.. let's just say the place gets real hyped when that happens.  Also, shoutout to our waitress Solji! Very accommodating and helpful when we went!"}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese ambience experience.  Food is okay and a bit on the pricey side.  Staff is amazingly friendly.  You just have to go there early or make a reservation in advance for table seating."}
{"text":"Went here last night for date night. The food was incredible! The menu offers either a set menu or pick your own so we decided to pick our own plates. Ordered the blanched rapini twice because it was that good.... would recommend anyone coming here to try! We also had the tempura prawns in spicy mayo which were amazing. We tried the baked oysters, sashimi salad, octopus balls, salmon tataki, kimchi and bibimbap. Everything was flavourful and just the right flavour combo. The bibimbap actually comes in a hot stone  bowl that finishes cooking at the table. This was our first time coming here and we will definitely be back to try more dishes. Amazing traditional japanese cuisine in a 'family-style' atmosphere where you're greeted at the door. The atmosphere is loud but it's part of the experience!"}
{"text":"GUU = DELICIOUSNESS!! They are so popular that there is a slang for when you want to eat there. GUU-ING! As in \"lets go GUU-ing!\" Haha. Now, you either hate or love eating here. The reason being: its always packed, they don't take reservations, line-ups are akin to clubs, its always loud and dish portions are small compared to what you are use to in North America.  To navigate your way through this and get the best \"GUU-ing\" experience possible..here are a few tips I would suggest following:  1) Keep your group small, the less people you have the easier it will be to seat you. 2) Go when they open, its easier to get in. Otherwise, you could be stuck waiting 20 mins+ for a table. 3) Order in one go. If possible, check the menu before going and know what you want. Its always packed so food takes a while to get to you. Keep in mind there is a 2 hour max seating time.  It's really easy to rack up a bill but I suggest trying their Takoyaki - deep fried octopus balls ($5.00), Enoki Hotate Bacon - enoki mushrooms and scallop wrapped in bacon ($6.00), Yakiudon Noodles - pan fried udon noodles w/ beef and veggies ($7.80), Buta Kimchi Bibimbap - rice, spicy ground pork, kimchi, egg in a hot stone pot ($8.80) and for dessert Banana Tempura - fried banana w/ coconut ice cream ($6.00).  Great for casual dinner with friends and family, possibly dates if you don't mind the noise. Note: If it is your first time, dont worry if you hear all the staff yelling when you come in or leave..they are just greeting and saying goodbye in Japanese. I previously visited with a friend once and she was startled by this.  Note: There is a new GUU location in Toronto, called GUU SakaBar. Their menu is a little bit more limited but still worth a visit because they have tatami mats."}
{"text":"Guu Izakaya is a fun place to go for a night out.  It has great atmosphere.  It is pretty small and nondescript from the outside, but once you walk inside it is loud and exciting.  I sat at the bar and had the deep fried brie and scallops.  The brie was delicious, the scallops were okay.  I would go back and try some of the beef dishes, which some of the other posters recommended."}
{"text":"Love this place! rigth when you walk in you are greeted by the staff and when you leave they make sure to say BYE too.  The atmosphere is loud so be prepared but i personally love it.  One thing you must try is the Sapporro Mijito it was perfect for a nice, sunny, hot day.  Food was exceptional...will be coming back here 100%"}
{"text":"I think our server thought we were the 3 craziest/indulgent white girls because we ordered the majority of items on the menu. It was soooo yummy and made me miss my vancouver's penchant for Asian cuisine!!! Everything was delectable. Some of my favs... The brie. The ebi mayo (obvs). Lobster tempura. Bibimbap. Yum yum yum yum. The sparkling sake was also amazing. Clearly, since we finished 3(4?) bottles pre nutcracker! The ambiance is super fun but fyi - if you're 3, they cramp you into a table for 2! My sister thinks it's better than the guu in van too. We definitely over ate."}
{"text":"Very good food but portions are tiny. I am a student so I need to be full wherever I go and on whatever occasions. The atmosphere is an A+, perfect place to introduce a friend to Japanese dining culture. I went with the popular food that Yelp people recommended so they all were good."}
{"text":"The first thing you really notice is the atmosphere. Its very loud and upbeat due to the music and the staff cheering in unison every so often. It's quite nice if you're okay with noise and all the staff communicate with eachother in Japanese.  The price is alright but definitely expect smaller to medium portions (especially with non-main dishes). If you're looking for a full stomach on a budget, don't come here. The two times I've been to Guu were for birthdays, and I can say that if you're willing to pay the (reasonable) price the food is delicious. They have group meals (i.e. 6 can dine, etc) but the conditions on these are quite restrictive. I'd recommend the bibimbap, though it takes a while to come.  Overall, it's a great restaurant. I wouldn't eat here regularly but if you're ready for some noise then this is definitely a place you want to try."}
{"text":"Well worth the wait. Great experience with communal tables and family-like lively dinning atmosphere. Hot dishes are the way to go!"}
{"text":"I love japanese food especially izakayas. I've been to tons of izakayas but none of them has beaten this one yet. Let's just say, I forgot what country I was in when I was here because I felt like I was in Japan!  1 star: ambiance is fun + inviting 2 star: staff because they all look like they want to be there 3 star: hot tea in the waiting area in the colder seasons 4 star: food selection, quality, and taste 5 star: clean bathroom  This is one for the books, you know who you are. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Are you and your really cool companions and buddies looking for a fun setting with small Japanese-style plates and some drinks? Well, if you are in Toronto, this place may have your answer. I arrived at this place with a friend and her interesting friend and I had a drink with a light dinner in the evening.   This place is really popular, even on Thursday evenings, so make sure you have an extra 45+ minutes to wait, especially if you have more than 3 people. When you walk in, it feels like you are welcomed into a really decent and casual dinner party, especially with the really loud greeting from the staff at this place.   The food here is tasty. I had the Karaage (fried chicken), Takoyaki (deep fried octopus), Gyu Tongue (angus beef tongue), and the Kakimayo (baked oyster with spinach, garlic mayonnaise, and cheese). The fried chicken had an excellent tenderness on the inside, and a decent crispiness on the outside. Takoyaki is really hot when served, so let it cool for a while. It had a great flavour from the sauce and a nice softness on the inside. The Gyu Tongue was chewy and flavourful and the bean sprouts were a nice garnish. The baked oyster was freshly baked, and had a slight thick and warm creaminess that made this dish one of the tastiest oyster dishes I had in Toronto so far.   The drinks here are not bad. The Sake Mojito was fairly refreshing and the mint was not too strong. Service is not going to be great when there's so many people so this is a place to chill out and not be in a hurry. The washroom is kind of cool and surprisingly clean. The patio outside seems like a great place to hang out when the temperature is greater than 19 degrees Celsius outside.   Overall, if you are looking to get a tiny flavour of the Toronto nightlife with your really cool companions and buddies with some tasty food and decent drinks, this place may be a pretty good choice. Just be prepared for some loud noise, and prepare yourself to talk louder. I had a great time here, and I think if I come back to this place again with a lot of really cool companions and a few good buddies, I think it will be the beginning of some memorable evenings in Toronto."}
{"text":"Want to feel the atmosphere of a restaurant in Japan? This is it!!! The food is great and everyone is jolly! We came here on a late Friday night with a party of four. This place was SO packed! The wait was going to be 45 mins but we opted to sit by the bar. Someone was celebrating their birthday so everyone was singing and taking sake shots.  At first I was skeptical about ordering bibimbap but decided to just do it. The bibimbap was delicious! The rice was crispy and full of flavor. Although the udon looked plain and boring, don't let it fool you! It's actually really good. We also got a couple of appetizers such as the salmon and takoyaki. I really enjoyed all the dishes that we had order. The only things to keep in mind are that the portions are not that big and service stinks when you're sitting at the bar (it was for us anyway)."}
{"text":"Went there for drinks with friends after a long day of roadtriping from Montreal. We arrived there around 10:30pm on a Saturday evening and it was farily crowded, but we did not have to wait for a seat. The ambiance was amazing with the employees greeting you loudly, which can shy a few customers.   Since we only went there for drink, I won't be able to comment on the food. We ordered a few sake bomb \"for good times\" as the menu said. It was indeed a good time as all the employees yelled (in a good way) in anticipation for the sake bomb. After us, a bunch of other tables also started to order a sake bombs and then started a sake bomb train. Will def come back again to try their food."}
{"text":"Went with a party of 11, definitely a place you can be loud and have fun with friends. Staff was energetic and attentive despite beint busy. We ordered quite a selection of food,but these are some of the honourable mentions.  Must order: -Karaage- Fresh, juicy, batter wasn't too thick -Okonomiyaki- Deep fried,different from your normal okonomiyaki,but very good -Kinako bibimbap- Very fragrant, and the melting cheese paired very well with the mushroom -Birthday special-Good selection of sake, green apple one was very great as well as with entire staff chanting haha -Sapporo pitchers- Great deal when you're sharing    Can skip: -Nori potato  Negatives: -Restaurant was slightly loud, but with a few drinks in,you may end up joining everyone -Food came a bit slow, but there were a lot of people -2 hours seating limit -Portions were a bit small -Cramped seating area  Overall, I would come again for sure,perhaps at a less busier day/different location, general quality of the food was great and paired along with a wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"everybody like it here. but not me. the food is good but the potion is way too small and the place is so noisy, couldn't really talk to others at all.  Everytime we will have to wait for at least an hour but the services is good."}
{"text":"I don't drink alcohol but the food is something you want come for. Very noisy because people are drinking and chatting loudly, but that's a given. The lineup is long, so you may want to come early or make an appointment."}
{"text":"If you want to get a TRUE japanese experience in Toronto, this is where its at!  Atmospher/Ambiance: As soon as you enter, the greeter yells at you in Japanese, raises his hand and all the servers and cooks around them raise their hand and actually look at you.  They will make you feel like a celebrity has just walked in.  The greeter is soooo good at his job, never missed to greet a single person and so did the cooks and everybody else. This is an open kitchen model, you can see them cooking. They have this cute outfit with a bandanna on, constantly yelling(playfully) at each other.  I was sitting at the bar table, constantly watched the cooks, made me feel like i was in a pirate ship  The environment is VERY LOUD, almost impossible to talk without yelling at each other.  Service: Impeccable! Not once did we get a feeling that we were not being taken care of. As soon as i would take last bite from my dish, and I am still chewing, a server would come and take the empty plate, almost like they get a notification that you are done.  The food came pretty fast, most of the food was given to us by the cooks themselves as we were sitting at the bar table, nonetheless, it was pretty easy to catch attention of any servers walking by despite the fact that they were super busy.  It appears that the staff in of this restaurant enjoys being there, everybody is cheerful and yelling along.  Food:  Them balls with Octopus!! Good lord! I am fairly a noob when it comes to sea food, so i can safely say that was the best sea food I have every tasted. There was a dish with spicy baby squids which was pretty tasty as well, a bit on the spicy side.   There was a dessert on their menu with Tempura Fried banana and Cocunat ice cream, perfect combination, really tasty!  In general, food was cooked perfectly and was very flavourful.  TL;DR: Authentic Japanese experience, amazing service, flavourful food."}
{"text":"If you want to kill your brand through expansion, Guu Toronto is the perfect case study. Guu Toronto is nothing compared to the original Guu in Vancouver.   Like the Guu in Vancouver, there's usually a wait. However the wait in Toronto is like 2 hours on weekends. I was here on a Monday and didnt have to wait long. I don't mind the long wait but will definitely give this place a pass for the following reasons  1. The food is nothing like the Guu in Vancoiver. Guu Toronto doesn't have the fresh seafood like Vancouver. The cooking style in Toronto is mainly grill and fried vs broil in Vancouver. The food is also very salty. Finally the signature yaki udon was way too moist vs dried.   2. The place is extremely noisey and loud. Like all Japanese restaurants, you are greeted by everyone at the restaurant but Guu Toronto takes it to the next level and turn it into a shouting match. I can't even dine in peace. The staff definitely need to tone it down a notch.   3. Poor ventilation. Since try have an open kitchen, you'll definitely smell like a restaurant when you leave. The place is also smoky. I have bad allergies and the smoke didn't help. I had a horrible experience.  I normally don't write long reviews but this experience was truly a huge disappointment. I feel bad for the Vancouver Guu restaurant as the Toronto restaurant is not a true representation of the Guu experience."}
{"text":"Greaaatt Japanese tapas place and wonderful cocktails.  Great for groups but also having communal tables is fun. The atmosphere is highly energetic. I pretty much love the entire menu however I always try out the specials. Always a great time! Try the Bamboo cocktail!"}
{"text":"Excellent izakaya location! Fun atmosphere and good service! Food is very good and you have various dishes. Enjoy a night there with friends!  It's loud, warm and life full inside!"}
{"text":"The best meal we have had in a very long time!  First approaching Guu, it seems a little closed off.  There are no windows, and a very small outside space.  When we walked in, a loud burst of energy flows out and all the staff (and some diners) shout a greeting - which I only assume is a greeting because it seems to be in Japanese!  The staff immediately approached us and asked if we had a reservation.  We did not.  They informed us it would be about a 25 minute wait, took our cell number, and advised they would call within that time frame.  Coming from Chicago, we anticipated the wait time to be well over 25 minutes, so we went to a local bar.    Right after ordering our drinks, the call came in that our table was ready!  Once we returned to the restaurant, we were seated immediately.  The place was packed, and again everyone greeted us in the same (Japanese?) welcome.    Atmosphere:  The energy is great.  Very loud, but perfect if you are looking for a little pick-me-up.  Wait staff is very friendly and helpful with the menu.  We sat in a two person table, however there are many long tables where several groups were combined and all seemed to be having a blast.  I would say this is not a kid friendly place (because of the noise) but perfect for a group of friends or a couple looking for something a little out of the box to spice things up!  Food:  Delicious.  Everything was amazing.  They serve from almost a tapas type menu, so we ordered several different plates.  One special - the pork belly - blew us out of the water.  Absolutely amazing.  Prices were on-spot as well.  For two of us, four drinks, and several shared plates (about 5-6) our dinner was about $100 with a generous tip.    A must do while in Toronto!"}
{"text":"If you don't reserve, prepare to wait ridiculously long. Seriously.   The atmosphere here is LOUD and its quite entertaining to say the least. The staff is very friendly as well. You walk in and you get greeted like a rockstar.  Food wise, its okay... quite tasty but nothing life changing for me. I might have to try more from their menu in the future but so far nothing stuck out for me.  I recommend this place if you want to bring friends.. or anyone who has a birthday... they'll sing their hearts out for you.. lol at least thats what I saw when I went there. haha"}
{"text":"Came here for an early lunch and was fairly surprised to find it empty on a weekday lunchtime! Relatively disappointed as we were ushered to a corner seat even though the restaurant was entirely empty!  I ordered a ramen and it was decent at best.  Nothing too amazing or extra-ordinary.  Considering were the only customers then too, service was rather slow and lacking. For the price you pay, I'd say you're better off at other Japanese food places.  The decor and atmosphere is decent, but the food really fell short of expectations!"}
{"text":"Went there with group of people.  Love the atmosphere.  Very loud and happy.  Pricey. Small portions but very delicious.   The only negative thing I could say is that the waitress could not remember who ordered what so it was lots of confusion and lots of people didn't know if they ate what they ordered.  Also, some dishes that we did ordered  we had to change as they run out them."}
{"text":"This is an outstanding Japanese \"tapas\" style restaurant with high energy and excellent food.  The service is a little scattered due to the high volume of customers, but otherwise, this place was a real find!   The greetings from all of the staff, at top volume and in Japanese, are startling if you don't expect them.  Prepare yourself and smile and wave back.  My friend and I arrived on a Monday at 5:30 and did not wait one minute, though we had to sit at the bar in front of the cooks.  This was an excellent move, as we later found, because watching the chefs prepare the dishes was entertaining!    We followed the advice of our server and ordered 8 dishes between the two of us, and shared everything.  Some highlights: Shabu Salad -- outstanding dressing. Deep Fried Soy Marinated Chicken and Deep Fried Prawns -- very good, with flavorful sauces.  Safe, if you are not Japanese experienced. Kinoko Cheese Bibimbap -- you'd never think cheese with mushrooms and sticky rice...think again.  It was fantastic.  The Calimari was VERY authentic and whole...which is hard unless you are experienced with Japanese cuisine.  Several Torontonians we spoke to couldn't believe we just stumbled upon this place.  I encourage you to do a little stumbling and stop by..."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had. I've been to Guu in Vancouver and this one is as good or better. A little crowded and uncomfortable waiting for a seat, but definitely worth the wait!   Standout dishes:  Bibimbap  Deep fried brie in some sort of fruit and cheese glaze  Black sesame ice cream for dessert!  Definitely come here if you are in the area, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"\"IRRASHAIMASE!!!\"  The roar of welcome from the servers and chefs as soon as you walk in past those thick wooden doors is deafening, adding to the din of chatter and laughter from patrons seated on long wooden benches jovially hoisting pitchers of Sapporo. Now, I love me a good 'ole Asian-style beer bar, whether it be a Japanese izakaya or a Taiwanese pejiu wu, and Guu definitely fits the bill. If you're not in the mood to party, however, there's a small patio outside where you can actually hear yourself think and place an order without shouting into your server's face.   It's no wonder people are so happy here, the \"tapas-style\" dishes are DELICIOUS. We tried the melt-in-your-mouth gindara (grilled black cod), gyu (beef) tongue, savory scallop and king oyster mushrooms, and the little deep fried oyster balls of heaven known as takoyaki. The only dish we could have done without would be the average \"pick three\" oden - we chose the ikaten, hanpen, and shikuwa.  As for the drinks, the cocktails I tried were well-mixed and proportioned... I can't wait to come back and try their chu-high (vodka and Japanese soda) concoctions! Come with a smaller group on busy weekend nights, as it will help you get seated faster - otherwise, be prepared to wait quite awhile!   Domo arigato gozaimashita, Guu.... 'till we meet again!"}
{"text":"love this place. have gone numerous time. love it every time."}
{"text":"I dined here twice, not yet being comfortable to assess an Izakaya for what it is, -I think I can easily keep coming back for more.   The service runs smoothly despite the constant slew of eager diners, and one can't help but (just slightly) eye the cute Japanese waiters as they come and go by your table.   The tragedy lies in winter, where you're stuck outside waiting in the cold, bone-chilling night, and the silly string of coat racks lumped haphazardly in the middle. Don't be surprised if you end the night finding your coat on the floor. I saw someone's Canada Goose stomped on the last time I was there. Tsk!  In terms of dishes, I heartily recommend the Gindaara, Nasumiso, Karaage and mayo ebi. The food was all very fresh, grilled and fried perfectly and the flavours were lust-worthy. Hello, seventh sin. Izakayas are pretty much set up to offer Japanese tapas, but heavy on the sake. Everything (I've tried) is delicious and you'll end up pretty much leaving the place with an empty wallet.   I'll be around much more once it gets warmer, or once the crowd bifurcates between the new Annex location and this."}
{"text":"food is amazing! I especially love the aburi here.  The restaurant has a modern, zen type of appeal to it and the staff is super friendly (albeit LOUDDD so if you're looking to have a chatty dinner, skip this place) It's a tapas style restaurant with some awesome japanese fusion style dishes.  I live close by to here and tried to order take out because I hate eating alone in restaurants. Big mistake. They could barely here me on the phone and the line kept cutting out. They messed up my order on more than 1 thing. I'm assuming it's because they couldn't hear me over the screaming and the music."}
{"text":"In Toronto for business and my colleagues and I stopped in to KINKA IZAKAYA for dinner.    Wow . I have to admit that I did not expect the lively atmosphere. What a cool place.  We actually heard the activity from outside the door. Not that it was over the top, but once inside it made sense. You're greeted at the door when you enter by the entire staff and bid farewell when leaving.   The staffs energy is on level 10, the guest are having a good time and there is 90's hip hop and dancehall reggae playing.  Japanese decor and food with a college vibe.   So everything we ordered was delicious.  We ordered the edamame, vegetable dumplings, kaburi  ( I think that's right) grilled beef short ribs. Salmon Tataki and Beef Tartare with quail egg (I passed on that one).  Washed it all down with two pitchers of Sapporo.   It's a bit loud and like a I said, a lot of energy. If your looking for a quiet date night or dinner, this isn't the place. But if you're out with friends and can use a little jolt to rev up your night... this is the place.   Really enjoyed our meals and the atmosphere. Would definitely return when in the area again.   Whoever put the music together gets two thumbs up.  I was in 90's heaven."}
{"text":"We ordered the bamboo sake and a few other mixed drinks that i can't remember but all the drinks were good. Food wise we had -Gomaae: spinach with sesame - i didn't think i'd like it but i was surprised cause it turned out pretty good. who knew sesame and spinach complements each other.  -karaage: fried chicken - wasn't too salty had a nice crisp really liked it -takoyaki: octopus balls - mustve been average because i dont remember how this tasted like -unagi doria: eel with mushroom rice...probably one of the best dishes we ordered that night in my opinion.  -kimchi udon: liked the flavor and texture of the udon but not a big fan of the kimchi. -saba - mackerel probably my least favorite dish...wasn't that flavorful and was really fishy... -kakimayo - oyster pretty good everyone really liked this dish... -good vibes for dessert (heh) portions were on the smaller side and expensive but all were really good and i say worth it. My group and I should have done one of the party options to save but i enjoyed all our dishes."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Food were fresh and delicious, we had the special Japan wagayu sashimi, hotate carpaccio, torched salmon sushi, karaage and kakimayo. Service was good and the servers were all very nice and energetic. Definitely a must go Japanese restaurant in Toronto!"}
{"text":"When you walk in, everyone screams and welcomes you in Japanese. The environment is Loud And fun, there's cool music and an open kitchen where the chefs also scream with excitement at the orders. A lot of the staff do not understand English very well.  One of our orders they brought this dish of raw octopus, instead of the fried octopus ball that we had actually ordered. The octopus was slimy and didn't taste good but we didn't send it back. Then she brought another thing we didn't order, however we sent this one back. The beef short ribs were delicious. The wagu beef sashimi was ok, but not what I expected. The hot stone and udon noodle dishes looked and smelled delicious. I would recommend sitting at the bar and watching what comes out before ordering"}
{"text":"Had a great night out here with some work peeps.  Loud environment. Lots of great small plates...and they all pair very well with beer and sake...lots of sake!"}
{"text":"This place does get super packed...the line was out the door!  However, it is super lively and positive, with the friendly servers and cheerful greetings every time someone enters the door.  I really liked all of the food, actually!  We got: the kinoko bibimbap (cheese, mushrooms, and seaweed YUMMM!), karaage (chicken with garlic mayo), yaki udon and bbq pork.  I also had the green island drink, which had aloe and guava.  Tasty food, great vibe and fair prices!"}
{"text":"It took a half hour to get a deep fried squid, which came out cold. Even the dish came out cold after getting notified it was cold. Overall, food was mediocre, and service was not as good as three years ago. It was sad for me to learn this place is not as good as i remembered three years ago. I felt pressured to order food constantly in order to hold my table. Very disappointing... and sad for me especially because it used to be the place to hang out.."}
{"text":"After being told by numerous people from over a year ago to Guu, I finally took the plunge, and it certainly lives up to its reputation. The bottom line is that Guu Izakaya is a great place to go with a friend or a small group (let them know if it's an anniversary!).  It's not a tiny place, but not large, so large groups should look elsewhere. Also, wait times get insane; from around 5:30pm until fairly late there will be a line and a wait from around 30 minutes to one hour.  The menu is quite versatile, featuring everything from the snack-sized to the more filling to some unique beverages (a sake mojito comes to mind). However, if you're going for a full-on meal, things will get quite expensive. Guu is more suited to ordering a bunch of dishes and sharing among friends, marveling at the unique flavours and presentation. For this reason, if you can manage it, it's a great place for a mid-afternoon or later evening affair, outside of the busiest times.  The ambiance deserves mention: every time a guest enters or leaves, they are met with fairly raucous greetings or goodbyes, as the case may be. I found it somewhat annoying at first, but you quickly find yourself sucked into the friendly atmosphere and everyone is smiling and having a great time.  Only one thing marred the experience; as an exceptionally busy, but small location, it is fairly difficult to get a server's attention as they are always busy ferrying things back and forth.  Overall, I will absolutely return. Guu gives you a warm feeling and is an experience that should be tried at least once."}
{"text":"Da Bomb!!  What a great restaurant and fantastic food.  The salmon sushi, the karaage  and almost everything we ate was great.  This place is so good, that we went there both nights we were in Toronto.  Also we got lucky, we went really early (opening time) on the first day and really late (towards closing time) on the second. I hear you need reservations here - but we did not have that issue."}
{"text":"Upgrading my rating from 4 to 5 well-deserved stars.  Brought my date here last night (been absent from this place for almost a year) and went all out crazy with the menu.  Ordered 15 dishes between the two of us, plus 10oz of plum sake.  The bill came to $180 (tax and tip) but it was well worth it.    Here's my review of the food divided into 3 categories:  \"OMG - I'll come in a snow storm for these\"  - Unagi Doria (I love unagi and this unagi rice with melted cheese is delish) - Hotate Carpaccio (Scallop in a wasabi mayo where all the flavours popped) - Takoyaki (Guu got these right on the money - tastes 100% authentic and served pipping hot) - Okonomiyaki (Forget Okonomiyaki House in Yorkville, Guu FTW) - Pumpkin Croquette (It's a hard boiled egg warped with pureed pumpkin and deep fried brought together will this slightly sweet mayo. The texture of the egg yolk matches that of the pumpkin - simply a brilliant dish) - Maguro Tataki (This seared tuna with bits of fried garlic drizzled with a vinegarette was amazing) 6.8 - Oden (The broth was so homey and hit the palate with a flavour reminiscent of mom's 24 hour broth)    \"Great, but not something to order every visit\"  - Kakimayo (Two large oysters that are baked with mushrooms, eggs, mayo and cheese - it was very heavy but tasted great) - Miso soup (Not your watered down or your DIY from-the-paste versions that lack a certain depth in flavour, this one really shines) - Gyu Carpaccio (Beef carpaccio with a vinegarette and fried garlic pieces) - Tontoro (Pork cheek stir fried in sea salt.  The meat had the perfect consistency which was crunchy and chewy. Simply loved it) - Gindara (Seared black cod with a miso butter sauce - the skin was perfectly crispy and the fish just shines in this dish - be careful of the bones)   \"Meh, give me something different\"  -  Kimchi Udon (This was my date's choice, as I don't think kimchi with anything tastes good) -  Agedashi Tofu (Another one my date's favorite dishes. I find fried tofu very boring  but must admit that the batter Guu used here was very good, but sorry it`s still just tofu after all) -  Nasu Miso (Egg plant with miso garlic sauce was ok - nothing special)"}
{"text":"Amazing vibrant atmosphere. Great for a party (5/5), but if you're looking to engage in conversation it's more of a 4. The energetic staff is so lovely and knowledgable about the menu. They will happily recommend on request. The servers also take care of all tables so you will be well taken care of. The food is spectacular, though tapas sized. Prices are reasonable as the quality is superb. I love how the place feels like a secret den...you would miss it if you didn't know where to go! Salmon belly is a must try...and the whole fried okra is amazing!"}
{"text":"You know a place is popular when it's been a little over a month and there are already 11 reviews on Yelp.   I think the food is great. It's not mind-blasting spectacular but it's tasty. There are definitely some hit (ebimayo, kakuni, kakimayo, almond tofu) and misses (gyu carpaccio and hotate carpaccio come to mind) but it's really hard to beat the atmosphere. One of the things I love about NYC is St. Marks and how all the Japanese restaurants are just absolutely bustling. It's great to have something exciting and lively in Toronto.  A few notes on the lineup. Yes it can be long. Yes you have to wait outside. However, I think that this is really the norm that most people face in other major cities. It just goes to show you how few restaurants there are in Toronto (I would almost say none) that have people willing to wait over an hour for. People are so not used to waiting that everybody is complaining about it. In places like New York, waiting an hour is normal. So if you don't want to wait, then show up right when it opens for dinner (don't know what time it is). I was also told that they will soon be getting heat lamps so that will hopefully make the wait outside a little bit better.  Another niggle about the restaurant is the terrible door design. Whichever genius (Bennett Lo) decided that a restaurant in a cold weather area shouldn't have a vestibule is an idiot. Luckily I've had the privilege of sitting at the bar (you should sit there, it's so much more fun chatting with the staff) and not by the damn door. But I would imagine that the door opening and closing would be a major pain.  Finally, I would say that the staff are really great at Guu. It may be just the 'newness' of the staff so they are really excited but if they can keep it up, it will be really fun. As I mentioned earlier, it's just so lively. The atmosphere is really what is 50% of this restaurant."}
{"text":"Guu is awesome! Such a fun time. Servers welcome and say goodbye to everyone who comes and leaves and it gets the place in an upbeat rowdy mood. The food is fantastic and was priced well. I like their small plates menu style. Will come again. Try going on a Monday it wasn't too busy!"}
{"text":"Great spot, very lively and lots of fun. Food pretty authentic (lived in Japan previously) and fairly priced for the city. GoGoGo!"}
{"text":"3.5 STARS  It's a really good restaurant - nice food (expensive imo) and the service is great...but I don't think it's upto all the hype it gets. the ambiance and atmosphere definitely give it that exciting vibe.     I wandered in a little after the normal lunch period one day and it was as expected - pretty empty.  I ordered a few dishes - beef tartare; grilled fish and tuna sashimi.  All were great, but the fish was particularly salty for my taste.  They are small dishes (tapas kinda style - lunch menu) and well the prices don't really reflect that.  For 3 dishes and a non-alcoholic drink I believe my bill with tip.taxes came up to over $40.  Ouch!  For a group of people, the vibe here is definitely fun - the dinner menu is more extensive with heartier dishes, I definitely have fun coming for dinner but I don't think it would be my first choice."}
{"text":"What can I say that others haven't said already. Food is excellent, service is great and if you want a loud environment this is the place."}
{"text":"So Guuuuuuuud !!!  After everything I kept hearing about Guu and all the reviews on Yelp I finally decided it'd be worth it to wait in line for an hour to get my fill at Guu Izakaya.   We got there at about 9:30 and were seated at 10:40 but we were a group of 4, keep in mind if you go in as a couple, you'd usually be seated within 20 minutes! Now on to the good stuff.  Food: First off, holy sh*t, their Avocado and Prawn with mayo and Panko topped dish special was by far one of the best things I've had in YEARS. The rest of the food wasn't anything extraordinary in the culinary world but what makes the food amazing is their execution. It's a fine line between good and great and Guu Izakaya makes sure they work to get across that line! Everything tasted amazing, perfectly cooked and well presented. Be ready to order about 3 dishes per person (will cost you around $7 / dish).  Staff: The staff were absolutely awesome and super friendly and started to teach us what words to say when we walk in (given how much yelling there is going on when you enter and leave) and made the whole experience a blast. Food came out like it was on a train, not too fast (as if to overcrowd our table) and not too slow (to a point where we were ever waiting for a dish).  Atmosphere: Amazing! If you're looking for a quiet date place this isn't it. There's TONS of yelling, you'll most likely be eating at a communal table but there's something still classy and modern about the place (I especially enjoyed the Katana Sapporo tap on the bar).   Overall, Guu Izakaya provided a food experience I haven't had in a long time and was really craving and I'll definitely be back for more soon."}
{"text":"Awesome environment and food. The staff is really energetic! It has a positive vibe to it and it's highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food was good, but didn't blow me away. It's a fun atmosphere though. When you walk in the door, you are greeted in unison by the staff. It's really loud since it's well known for the sake bombs and cheers that go with it, so if you're looking for a place to have an uninterrupted conversation, I'd suggest somewhere else."}
{"text":"great atmosphere and good food. If you are looking for something low key and quiet THIS is not your place!"}
{"text":"Love Guu. Always delicious, great atmosphere, super fun with friends.  The only problem is that it always puts a huge dent into my wallet without getting me very full. They are super busy all the time so make reservations!  My favourite dishes are definitely the Kakimayo (baked oyster), takowasabi (wasabi marinated octopus), and the Ikapiri (deep fried calamari with awesome-sauce), but everything I have tried there so far has been on point in terms of quality and taste.   Definitely go with a group of good friends for the experience and great food. It's always a fun time there!"}
{"text":"It's like the Spanish Tapas, but Japanese style! It was good. I particularly loved the Big Cup beer. It's like drinking a whole pitcher on your own."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Toronto. The food, atmosphere, and cocktails are all fantastic. Guu is lively to the max, so if you are looking for a quiet venue, then I recommend going elsewhere. The restaurant is a little difficult to locate from the street. Yes, you are supposed to enter through the plastic rain flaps."}
{"text":"MMMKKKAAAYYYY here comes the review I've been putting off for a while, because I don't have enough words to describe and I get lost in thought. So here's point/numbered form:  1. We waited for 2.5 hours on a Saturday night, we got here around 730 and got to eat at 10pm. Went to Queen and Beaver after putting our name down. They're supposed to call you if you're next in line but we just showed up.  2. It was PACKED, looud, crammed, full of happy laughing people.   3. Every time somene leaves the restaurant the whole place screams and waves at them and it's amazing and hilarious  4. They have 1L jugs of Sapporo. HOLY MOTHER OF GOOODDDDD!!!!! I was in heaven. 1L jugs of anything are ma kinda jugs  5. We ate the following: deep fried brie, shrimps (battered), cheesey mushroom rice in hot stone pot, beef tongue, beef sashimi, pork cheek, deep fried chicken, fried calamari... I think that's it. I discovered a burning, passionate love for tapas bars...i was so worried when I was coming here that I would just get to try one or two dishes. PHEW! The brie and beef sashimi were my favorite, the calamari were disappointing.  6. All that food, 3 1L beers and two of those glass bottle drinks (where you have to pop the glass ball in to drink it) and the bill came to appx $150. Now cheap but there were 4 of us, a lot of the dishes come with 4 pieces so it worked out perfectly.   Bathrooms were amazing, they have mouth wash, cream, hair spray, etc - so cool! and clean!   Great experience, I would go here again...I don't mind waiting and hitting up a bar before dinner either :))"}
{"text":"I love izakaya and Kinka is always a good choice to grab food and drinks with some friends. I love the environment here, the servers are all so friendly. This is the main reason why I love coming. Their service is great. Everyone is super attentive and friendly. No matter how busy they are, they always have a big smile on.   In terms of food, I have always loved their offerings. My favorite is probably the baked oysters and the deep fried brie cheese. I think Kinka is a solid spot whenever you want to have dinner, or want to go for drinks and some snacks. However, it is extremely loud for dates. I don't recommend coming for dates as this restaurant isn't very big, and it can be quite loud whenever they greet customers who are entering."}
{"text":"I'm a GUU fan!! Delicious food, lively atmosphere and top notch service. Be sure to make reservations, line up can get very long."}
{"text":"I would like to start off by just saying that just because the workers here are mostly Japanese doesn't make this an \"authentic\" Japanese experience. A typical izakaya in Japan is nothing like this - so hopefully people won't have the wrong expectation when they actually visit one in Japan.  Like almost every review has mentioned, the atmosphere of this place is very energetic. Lots of loud shouting as they call out orders, and of course, every time someone gets seated or leaves they greet you in unison. This is actually not at all common in Japan - izakayas are almost never that loud and people don't randomly shout all over the place. Take your Japanese friends here and it'll actually be funny to them that this is our interpretation of a Japanese izakaya. Nevertheless, It's a cool experience, but after about your 12th time going, it's just more of a gimmick than anything, and could be sort of irritating if you just want to chat amongst your friends. If it's your first time, it's always gonna be a fun experience.  The energetic experience pairs nicely with the overall ambience of the restaurant. The interior decor does feel Japanese, and there is a cohesive feel to the restaurant, where you get the sense that everyone is there to have a good time. I see no problem coming here alone either, a bunch of people do, and they don't seem out of place - you can get seated at the bar right in the middle of the action so you never feel left out. Yes the wait time tends to be long during popular times, but once you walk in, all your frustrations melt away because they make you feel like you were wanted there. Also, the service once you get inside tends to be super fast and efficient, so you won't have to wait too long for your food and drinks to arrive.  I was not very impressed with the food the first few times I came here, but because there were a few standout dishes, I kept coming back, and eventually by my 8th time here, I got my usual order down: kimchi udon, kinoko cheese bibimbap, unagi doria, salmon natto yukke, oden, and almond tofu are all my go-tos. The main problem with most of their dishes is that they tend to be too salty for me - probably to pair nicely with the beer, but as someone who's not much of a beer drinker, their dishes were slightly on the salty side. The dishes I mentioned are excellent and are not overly salted - in fact, these dishes alone are the reason I'm giving this restaurant such a high rating.  The price of this place tends to be on the higher end (usually ~$30/person for enough food and a drink) - whereas a typical izakaya in Japan is much cheaper ($35 would typically get you an all-you-can-eat and drink package). Nevertheless, I think the prices they charge are the going rate for a typical izakaya in Toronto. I haven't been able to find a place that's much cheaper and I've been to a bunch around here (Don don, Fin, Zakkushi, Kingyo etc.). If you want to save some money, have a light dinner somewhere else, and come here for a little bit of food and drinks. The drinks aren't too expensive.  If you want a more authentic experience, try Koyoi - that place is probably closer to what you can expect at a typical izakaya in Japan. With that said, the few outstanding dishes here and the overall atmosphere makes this place a staple restaurant to visit when you're in Toronto."}
{"text":"Everything is perfect. Food is delicious, amazing vibe and Perfect service. I'm coming back for sure. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is loud and in your face as soon as you walk in. Definitely an experience worth taking in, as long as you're prepared. Unfortunately, I think we came in on an off day for service. We were sat down pretty quickly, but ignored soon after that. No dedicated waiter came by, and we had to flag someone down to take our orders. Our food came out as they were readied, which we were able to see directly since we were seated at the counter. No one brought us any waters or utensils though, and we had to ask twice.   The food was pretty good, particularly the yakiudon and oden. The portions were definitely tapa-sized, maybe just a tad smaller than what the prices suggested. In any case, there is enough variety to satisfy any taste."}
{"text":"Food was only okay, really nothing too special :( Disappointed because Yelp was raving about how good this place was. Bottom line: Overpriced and just meh."}
{"text":"I'm dying to go back.  Great choices, nice theme and decor.  Wish I only knew how to order. My fav... black sesame seed ice cream..."}
{"text":"if guu was a person, i wouldnt think twice about running up to him and ask him if he can be my bff and if i can hug him . i love guu . i love how homey and welcome they make me feel, both the food & the staffs . it feels like im right where i belong .  i might be bias because i love japan . like, everythinggg about it . esp the people & the food . and the cherry blossoms . and the streets . and the language . and .. well, you get my point . i fell in love when i went to osaka last year and been soo sad that theres barely any real authentic japanese restaurants other than sushi in toronto . then there's guu . guu makes me happy .  i was there in a group of 8 for a friends bday . as soon as you walk in, all the staff yells out to greet you . i LOVED it . as you leave, they yell at you to say bye . i loved it . but i think my friend loved it even more than i did cuz i caught her subconsciously waving at the people that were leaving too . :| haha dork . oh ! they sang her a happy birthday song too . they as in ALL the staffs . & they seemed like theyre happy to do it unlike other places where they look miserable and forced . some of cooks by the bar even danced while singing it . i LOVED it . everyone who worked there seemed so happy, which made the atmostphere that much better . guu made me realize the attitude of the staffs make a HUGE difference, a LOT more than i ever thought . as for the communal tables, i normally dont like them for dining, but technically, this isnt a full meal dining restaurant, its an izakaya . so i wont complain about that .  my bf & i shared 7 dishes in total .  - deep fried brie cheese . this was our favorite . my mouth waters just thinking about it . - maguro tataki (tuna sashimi): we had nothing to complain about it . fresh ! - kakimayo (grilled oysters): was a little too salty . and whats with that big chunk of salt they give you under the oyster shells ? - salmon natto yukke: i am NOT a picky eater . i LOVE all kinds of food but there are 3 things i just cant learn to like no matter how hard i try . celery, chicken feet and natto . i tried natto for the first time in osaka . i didnt like it . i thought guu might change that . i still didnt like it . you need a REAL acquired taste for natto and i dont have that . :( if you dont like natto, you wont like this dish . - yakiudon: as simple as this dish is, ive never been to a restaurant that got the perfect flavor & noodles . guu did . its EXACTLY how it should be . my friend said thats her fav thing to order and its consistent every single time . good job guu :) - unagi doria: eel on mushroom rice w cheese . i loved it . eel didnt have that fishy taste like most places . ugh, im craving for it as i type this .   so 4.5 stars for the authenticity and yumminess of the food and solid 5 (or 10 !!) stars for the staffs and the atmosphere of the place . i love how happy the staffs are here that it actually made me wish i can quit my office job & come work here w them . i really didnt mind the cute cook by the bar either . :)"}
{"text":"The food is great, the cocktails are fab, the noise and atmosphere is really fun - highly recommend for a group of friends that love to eat, drink and be merry"}
{"text":"I came here on Tues 28th and it was still very busy.  We waited about 2 hrs from 6-7:45pm.  It's nice that they had the heat lamps and enough cheerful people outside to help the time fly by.    I've been to the Guu in Vancouver and this Toronto one was definitely much more rowdier where they greet you coming in and out.  Very tough to talk without screaming at times. We sat at the end of the picnic table with 6 other strangers. It was nice that we could see the foods they were getting and decide from there.  Food was declicious and well worth the wait.  Service was quick and friendly.  We had: 1. Salmon Natto Yukke - an medly of ingredients all gelled together with raw egg yolk and you roll your own on sheet of seaweed.  It was good but the egg yolk was overpowering. Interesting but not amazing 2. Kaki Furai - 6 fried bread oysters with 3 types of sauces.  The breading was just right where you could taste the essence of the oyster and spread some of the sauces to enhance the taste 3. Enoki hotate bacon - enoki mushroom & scallop wrapped with bacon.  The enoki & bacon wasn't that interesting, the enoki was chewy and soaked up the bacon taste but didn't give anything back.  Bacon & scallop are always good but it tasted the same as anywhere else. 4. Gindara - grilled black cod - sooo yummy, it had a slight fatty taste that melted in your mouth and something else light. It was about handsize wide piece you're given but so good 5.  kakimayo - grilled oyster with spinach and cheese baked.  This was to die for. The cheese and pickled mushroom fulfilled my comfort food craving.  This was the only dish I wanted seconds of. 6.  Hotate Carpaccio - scallop sashimi - it was refreshing and light 7.  Octopus sashimi from the menu du jour - very light and refreshing as well 8.  Banana tempura - kind of bland, the banana didn't have taste and the teaspoon coconut ice cream was the best part. 9. Sake Mojito - so yummy and light  10.  Cherry sake - very sweet and definitely a girly drink Our total with tax and tip for 2 people came out to $120 and we were full.  I can't wait to come back and try the remainder of the menu.  I hope they change it up every few months though. Although every thing was delicious the first time, I don't think they're comfort foods that i would crave repeatedly.  I did find that when we were leaving around 10:30 there was no line up anymore and the place had about 15 seats open.  I may opt to come later for a midnight snack so we can avoid the 2 hr wait."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful, the people who work there are wonderful and respectful. The DISHES are freaking amazing! I LOVED EVERY DISH we picked out. I have never been to a restaurant where every dish was soooo good!  i made my first account at yelp just to yelp this restaurant!  i loved it. I was actually visiting canada from the us! i REALLY wish we had one in maryland!"}
{"text":"This is a typical Izakaya but overall I had a just average experience.  The ambience is full of people screaming at the top of their lungs and drumming, which was pretty annoying if you're trying to talk at all. I did like how in summers they have an outdoors dining patio area, which is much better and quieter than the inside. The poor staff were literally losing their voice from yelling.  The food was standard izakaya fare. Pretty good but nothing stood out. The more adventurous sounding menu items like the fried pumpkin croquette was just heavy and weirdly flavoured. I wouldn't say bad, but nothing I'd order again.  The service was adequate since they always have a full house. We were able to get in with some waiting without making any reservations on a Friday night around 6 PM.  Overall I'd rate them much higher if there wasn't so much unnecessary screaming. I get the fun and loud environment part of it but there's a limit. Having a normal conversation, we would get interrupted every minute or so when a group enters or leaves the restaurant because it's followed by so much yelling and drums."}
{"text":"Truly is an unique experience!!  First of all, it's a great place for a large group of people out for casual, non-verbal communication heavy outing. The food is mostly tapas style small portions so you can order a bunch of them and try. We were a group of 12, so lucky for me was able to try about six to seven different dishes!  Favs: hands down Gindara (grilled black cod), Kabocha Karokke (pumpkin croquette), okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake), Brie cheese, Takoyaki (octopus balls)  Just okay or not so great: Kinko bibimbap (mushroom rice sizzling bowl), Yakiudon (noodle with beef)  Since it was my birthday dinner, I was the lucky recipient of a very enthusiastic ceremony - they do make you feel exceptionally  special! :)  The only downside is that the loudness everyone talks about here, is almost at an unbearable point after about 30 minutes of being there. You can't have conversations and you're likely to walk away with a headache."}
{"text":"Went to Kinka Izakaya last night and had an amazing time. The staff are so, so friendly and enthusiastic, and all the happy yelling gives the place the best vibe. The long table style seating makes it easy to talk to anyone sitting near you and conversation naturally spills across tables.  Not only is the atmosphere fantastic, but the food is incredible too. The ebimayo and the deep-fried brie were unbelievably good. And the 1L beers made me feel like a tiny child.  There's no way you can have a bad time here unless you hate noise and maybe have some dietary restrictions or something. I'm not a local and this will be a must-do every time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Being part of the Kinka family myself, of course I'm biased. But if I wasn't, i think I would be even more impressed.   I've been here several times before and each time, the atmosphere, the service and THE FOOD is amazing. I don't know which one out of all three I like better.   I came here with a friend for my birthday, and the staff was more than welcoming. It's a bit hidden behind that Indian restaurant, but as soon as you find it and walk in, you're greeted by the entire staff of Guu. Everyone welcomes you in Japanese and you can feel (especially on a Friday night), the fun everyone is having. It's such an upbeat experience.  I got seated at the sushi bar (TRY to get a seat here, you get hand your dishes immediately by the chefs and you get to see how they make it).   All the dishes were 5/5 for me. Although a bit more on the pricey side, it was all worth it.   KARAAGE (deep fried soy sauce chicken w/ garlic mayo) - Basically deep fried chicken, soft and tender.   IKAPIRI (deep fried calamari w/ spicy ketchup & wasabi mayo) - YOU HAVE TO TRY. It's like a octopus ketchup chip. It's just awesome.   I also got two more dishes on the special menu. One was a pork belly salad, as well as a octopus salad. I wish I had the description, but I definitely recommend both. The pork belly salad was a bit more fatty than I would of liked, but what do I expect from pork belly?  We also had their house sake which is custom brewed in Japan and then shipped overseas. It's a sweet fragrant sake. It's also called Guuu'd Sake, I mean you have to try it for the name sake right? (sake...)  Anyhoo  it's a great place to bring friends, for a birthday, to bring on a date etc. etc. Just amazing in general and I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Food is good, happy hour is pretty decent ($16 for a pitcher and karaage?) and it's always a lively place. Make sure you reserve a table online or go there before 6, else you're screwed. The yakiudon has this smokey flavour and is delicious, can never go wrong with the beef or salmon tataki either.  Pros: food is yummy Cons: the noise can be a bit much sometimes, but it's part of its charm"}
{"text":"Haven't been to this place ever since the name change. Came here on a Monday evening around 6:30pm and the place is 80% full, only small tables of 2 are available. Once you walk in, all the staffs great you really loudly, a very big welcome! The staffs are very friendly and energetic! There are drink specials everyday for the bar menu. It didn't take long until they brought over our drinks and food. We had the fried chicken, which came in big pieces, so you can actually taste chicken more than the breading. It was fried well where the chicken wasn't over or under cooked and the breading wasn't fried until it was hard. The mushroom and cheese rice was good too. It came in a stone bowl, the bowl was SUPER HOT!!! You can feel the actual heat the bowl gives off, once you come close to it, so BE CAREFUL! You mix the rice, mushroom and cheese together, which gives you a really creamy rice that resembles risotto. Taste isn't bad but nothing too special which I would order again though.  Overall, I would come back for drinks and tapas but if you're trying to catch up with a friend or have some serious conversations, either be prepared to yell your lungs out or find another place. The continuous yelling of the staff is what makes this restaurant so hyped up! They also greet you when you leave by yelling too."}
{"text":"This is a staple in Toronto gastric culture. Each dish satisfies a different aspect of the gastric experience; whether your searching for sweet, savoury, umami - flavour, or spicy - crispy. This pub fare inspired Japanese cuisine is a must for any Torontonian or any visitor seeking for a unique and memorable experience.   My absolute faves include:   Ikapiri Chicken Karaage Takoyaki Okonomiyaki Grilled Short Ribs"}
{"text":"Such a funky experience! So cool, loud and different than your average Japanese experience. It's definitely a good idea to go with a group for a good night out. Definitely recommend making reservations, as they are usually full!"}
{"text":"Loud and fun with everyone seated at long communal tables like a middle school cafeteria; this place is rocking night in and night out. Often credited for starting the izakaya revolution in town, this place is a lot of glitz and glamour but doesn't have a lot to show for. As soon as you walk in the door you are greet by the whole team of teenage staff enthusiastically shouting some words of encouragement in Japanese.  There are a variety of Japanese tapas to choose from. Some are affordable while others are definitely priced out of range for their teenage clientele (yes, the crowd is young and loud here). You patiently sit there going through dish after dish just waiting for that moment when something blows your mind. The sad truth is you will never really get to that climax and the next thing you know it the bill shows up and you've spent $50 eating stuff that you don't even remember.  OK is what I would describe it. Great place to take your nieces and nephews because it's fun. At the end of the meal, you will only walk away remembering the rowdiness of the crowd(and staff) but you probably won't remember what you ate."}
{"text":"Kinka Izakaya (formerly Guu) is definitely not your typical Japanese restaurant - it's better! The popular spot is always loud and bustling with waitstaff yelling Japanese phrases every 30 seconds, and sake bomb chants throughout the night. The food is absolutely amazing - from the Oysters with cheese to Takoyaki to Gyu Carpaccio to Kimchi Udon, we could not stop ordering!   We came for a birthday and got the famous celebrity treatment with a huge sign, birthday song by staff, and a group Polaroid. We also ordered the Seven Samurai sake shots ($21) which were surprisingly smooth and fruity. Overall, we had a great experience with the food, service, and atmosphere - for $30 per person!"}
{"text":"The name has changed but the food and service are the same! This place is awesome! Great for birthdays and out of town friends.  All the staff greet you in Japanese when you enter the store and the energy continues all the way to when you leave.    The food is Japanese tapas for sharing. You can't go wrong with the rice and noodle dishes which I recommend to also help fill you up since the portions are not large. The black cod is also a must. It's very buttery and melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"Guu was a great place!  It was my frist time to check out a Izakaya style restaurant and it was a good time.  The food provides a great variety of options and is perfect for sharing with friends, and tastes good.  There was hip-hop music playing throughout the meal which made the experience that much more laid back.    Their calamari is a must try."}
{"text":"I tried their food 3-4 times already, it's really good, healthy and delicious, and the price is reasonable. Very nice lunch menu for $ 10"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The price is affordable and the quality is A1! I've been here three times in a row already within this week. The oysters are a must and deep fried Brie."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Selection was good. Ramen was tasty. Octopus balls were good. Kalamari was chewy, I prefer more crispy w/ tentacles. Not used to eating cheese at Asian eateries but was good. Green tea cheesecake was bomb. Service was okay. Not pumped about it, but wouldn't mind returning."}
{"text":"Guu is simply amazing!  It's a traditional \"post-work pub\", in which it's super loud, super energetic and the food is a medium to socialize.   I had gone into Guu being told that it would be loud ....I wasn't told just how loud. I know that sounds bad, but Guu has this energy that just absorbs you in if you let it. As soon as you enter, everyone will turn to the door and yell and scream and wave for you to come in and enjoy yourself (a bit daunting for the first-timer).   As you sit down, you'll realize that all of the customers take part in the yelling too. When each dish is ordered, the waiters will yell it to the kitchen staff who will yell back that they heard. More often than not, someone will start singing. Combine this with copious amounts of sake flowing around and you've got one hell of an amazing time.   This is NOT a place to bring your first date; you will find it hard to hear each other over the noise. This is a place you bring your close friends for a good way to set the mood for the night to come. Get some food, get some drinks and yell and be merry.  TL;DR: Guu is a fun pub for the light-hearted. Not recommended for people used to dining at \"classier\" establishments ;)"}
{"text":"Great googly moogly, y'all!   Quite simply stated: this was the best dining experience of my entire life. From the apparently sincerely joyous and continuous yells of the staff, to the rapturous smells and tastes, Giz is a delight for all senses and a transcendental culinary adventure.  Everything tasted amazing, but the lobster tempura should be a controlled substance."}
{"text":"I had a great time at this Japanese Tapas Restaurant. I would recommend the Oysters to anyone and everyone that goes here along with the fried chicken!"}
{"text":"I was surprised when I came in into the restaurant and all the staff started cheering for me! That was a warm welcome! After I realized that this was the way they did with everyone coming in and out and celebrating something! It was a cheerful place, even if some times very loud. The food was also fantastic! I had several Japanese \"tapas\" and I loved them all."}
{"text":"they are fun restaurant. you feel the joy of thier work. always smiling and singing. the food is really good. but is quite loud."}
{"text":"Fun place, great service, tapas bar environment with broad selection. Thought we wanted sushi tonight and decided to try this style instead.  Complete rookie. Great sashimi. Beef and noodles could have used more beef but I'm a meat and potatoes guy ... Local branded beer wasn't special but was fine ...   Highly recommend. On the noisy and fun side of the scale but could still enjoy table conversation."}
{"text":"Aweful. Do not go here. Totally overhyped and not good at all. We went here based on all of the reviews and were really disappointed. It's not Japanese food or sushi and it's mostly Korean, but their Korean food sucks too. The bimbimbap we had was just fried rice. No vegetables and no meat. The Japanese udon noodles are pasty and tasteless. The fried chicken with a side of mayo was also a big disappointment. If you enjoy Asian food, please listen to me and do not go here. This is just a big gimmick. Avoid."}
{"text":"I was happy with the food for my second experience.  What I was not happy about was the reservation process.  I made a reservation online but had to make a change.  I was not able to do that online so I called, and called, and called. I figured no one was picking up b/c it's so loud in there. It took me forever to get through but I finally did and changed the reservation to later - or so I thought.  When we got there, I was surprised to learn that they didn't have the new reservation.  At this time it was busy so there was no room for 5 ppl.  Fortunately 2 ppl had cancelled so they had a seat for the 3 of us.    Other than the non-apologetic reaction when we arrived, the service this time around was great!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I tried a little bit of everything from the menu and was surprised each time with how good everything was. The Yellowtail tuna steak was freaking amazing. The tables were less than stellar though. They were cramped, small, way too close together and just really uncomfortable. If you don't mind that then everything else is good."}
{"text":"Smart people would make reservations beforehand as this place is packed with no seated waiting area. You have to stand like a gecko against the wall towering over tables as customers eat and finish their meal as you give them the \"eat faster I'm watching you\" look. Bustling, fun, and noisy, it's essentially a Fun place for gatherings when you want a drink and good food pairings. The ambiance is warm, exiting, high ceiling, but really noisy you may lose your voice by the end of the night or find yourself spitting over food as you try to make yourself heard at at your table conversing with the person across from you. The food is really good. The different dishes varied drastically in texture from crispy, to slimy (yes na-do& okra are slimy), to heated chewy noodles, your taste buds are in for a treat! Location is easy find as it's close to Eaton Centre and side street paid parking lining the adjacent roads. Bill will come out to approx $25 per person with table of four and maybe five plates to be shared amongst the team and one drink. Food serves are small as it's meant for social settings as opposed to eat till you fill. Would recommend but make sure you call in advance or be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Loud, boisterous, and freakin delicious. Go with friends, order a bunch of things (including drinks) and just take it all in. Amazing experience."}
{"text":"Only 11.50$!! Came here for lunch and got an amazing negi-toro don with soup and salad for only 11.50$ - a really great value. The tuna was decently fatty and flavourful, mixed well with enough green onion and grated wasabi. Highly recommended!  Lunch time is less crowded with more attentive service, definitely great if you're saving the saké bombs for another night! Still love the warm welcomes and farewells that the staff chants together."}
{"text":"From the moment you enter to the moment you leave, it is an experience. When you enter the whole restaurant explodes into greetings! It is like tapas Japanese style! I have been here several times, and some of those times even waited an hour to get in. The entire place feels so live and energetic, with people bustling in and out, and the staff running around with food! I loved it every single time, and every time i have been here the food has NEVER disappointed me. Pretty much everything on the menu is amazing, and they come out very fast! Definitely try their daily specials! The bibimbap, the sake specials, the calamari are definitely on my must order list. It is a great place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"amazing food. amazing service. amazing experience. came here on my birthday and it made my day so much more special. will definitely be coming back many many times. I thought the bathrooms were very nice too. would definitely recommend guu to anyone who likes japanese food and is looking for a new experience!"}
{"text":"came here with a friend on a thur evening around 7pm.  the place was packed but we were able to get seated by the bar right away.  like many other reviewers mentioned, the energy at this place is great!  not the best place to have a nice and quiet meal, but def a good spot to catch up with friends to just relax and be yourself.  the two of us ordered a bunch of dishes.  the maguro (tuna) tataki was very fresh and delicious. chicken karaage was good but a bit too deep fried/doughy for my taste. guy shabu salad was surprisingly delicious, even though it looked pretty ordinary at first glance.  ikapiri (calamiri) was yummy, and gindara (grilled black cod) is so tender and juicy, a MUST try!  we also got the sake sampler where you can try 3 different sakes for $11, very good deal~"}
{"text":"I usually go right at opening, so I don't have to wait. When I go with just myself and one other person, the wait is about 45 minutes or so. If you're willing to share a table, the wait is shortened.  The food here is delicious. Very fresh and authentic Japanese food. As soon as you walk in, you are greeted by loud cheers from the entire staff. You really do feel like you are transported into a bar in Tokyo.  My favourite dishes are: salmon tataki, teriyaki gyu tongue, and the kinoko bibimbap."}
{"text":"a very loud restaurant, the food was average Izakaya  food.  We liked the beer and cocktails, we also order the special sake which was $40."}
{"text":"Quality Japanese meal, but comes with a price. You'll be able to enjoy the Japanese culture here. The dishes are relatively small, so don't come here to fill a hungry stomach unless you don't mind spending more."}
{"text":"I've heard many good things about Guu so I decided to give it a try. We made a reservation but still need to wait for our table, but that wasn't a big deal for me. The atmosphere was loud and fun. They have that rustic and warm ambience. Service was good, but the food wasn't worth the price. I love how they are pretty creative with all their dishes but most of the dishes that I tried has one dominant flavour that overpowered others. I could taste a lot of chicken powder in my tuna tartar. Seared beef sashimi had too much vinegar in it. Not sure if I will come back here."}
{"text":"Takowasabi - dudE! yeah! this was rad! Misosoup - dudE! yeah! totally tasted like miso soup!! Hamachi sashimi - yeah! dudE!  this was gnarly! Gyu Carpaccio - dudE! yeah! this was awesome! Karaage - dude!! no nono no oooo nooo!! (well dude, better than KFC, but thats not really a compliment) Okonomiyaki - dudE!! why was this sold out!!!  Gindara - dudE! maybe!?! It was interesting, but terribly overrated (dude! was that just an uncle jesse quote- yeAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!) Kinoko Cheese Bibimbap - dudE! yeah!! this was tubular!! (and filling!!) Almond Tofu - dudE! this little mini dessert was light and bodacious!!  They totally gave me a way big suprise with the welcome!! I thought it was righteously funny to watch other 'first-timers' walk in and see their expressions. The atmosphere is mondo stellar and the staff enjoy what they do! ~ a little over 30$/person and worth it. it was cooool sitting at the bar and watching the cooks work their magic! totally wayyy stoked to come back here!!"}
{"text":"Great food, wicked atmosphere and solid service.    All the food I have had has been good and some of it has been great. I would recommend you try the sake because this place has a great selection and does flights.  The best recommendation I can give is that this is the place I bring people from out of town when they come to visit."}
{"text":"Kinka is soo much fun with really great food! We came on a Wednesday night and the place was packed! We were immediately greeted with cheers, someone in the back with a horse head on singing happy birthday and 2 minutes later chanting of \"sake bombs\" was happening!! It was awesome!! We got an assortment of things -maybe 13 dishes for 5 people. It was all shareable and delicious. I really couldn't complain about any of the dishes really. Highlights include the brie, pork belly, sashimi salad, and tako carpaccio. I would totally come back here. What a great experience!!  Keep eatin-"}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite Izakaha place I have ever been in my life. Fun, nice atmosphere and energetic! Love the menu and the beverages. I would recommend weekdays since it is usually less crowded and you won't have to wait in line outside as it is was happening a while ago during Saturday nights as we all know it is kinda impossible to find a spot to eat in Toronto on the busiest night of the week. They have a nice selection of beers and also I love that when you come in and leave everyone greets you promptly in the real Japanese style. It is fun to seat with other people as they have long wooden table where you can share fun evenings with other random people that are there as well to enjoy the food and the atmosphere. It all comes to a great service and also the price is right, I really enjoy coming here at least a few times a year or whenever it is possible."}
{"text":"Good food and good service - it's noisy and rambunctious - because it's supposed to be. I actually read a review in which someone complained about the staff yelling. THAT'S PART OF GOING TO AN IZAKAYA.   The chicken karaage in particular is delicious, and there's a lot of drink specials."}
{"text":"I have been to this place so many times. Every time I go I love it even more. Such a great experience I always have at this place. Their food is fantastic and their shouting and howling makes it a fun place. You cant expect a quiet and romantic dinner here but its a lot of fun with friends and large group. Super friendly and full of energy staff. Their welcome greeting will make your day. Just go and have a fun night :)"}
{"text":"This izakaya spot is dope. From the food to the close service. They really go all out when you arrive to leave. They do group greetings and send off every time you're seated and finish your meal. We had the Kakimayo and Pumpkin/Egg Dish with a few other dishes and they're good. Can't complain with fried/bar food. They have a fairly good drink menu from sake carafes to 1L beer mugs.We had around five people in our group and it did not have reservations so it took us like 45+ mins to be seated.  I think the overall experience is where they win out. There's not many places here these days that try to provide good service and food in combination of a different experience. Please be advised, talk loud. It was hard to hear cause there is just so much going on from people having fun and chilling to birthday song being sung by the restaurant staff.   Overall, it is definitely worth the wait and visit. It'll be a fun time. Make reservations and save room for many dishes on their menu."}
{"text":"This place is super top-noch! The vibe of the place as well as the interaction with the staff is truly unique. The menu is a little adverterous, but if you are into trying new things, then this place is very good..   I went with my girlfrend, and we sat at the bar. It's a great place to sit for two people so you can see everything going on..   Can't remember what I ate to be speific for the review, but we had 7-8 dishes last time, and 6-7 of them were worth ordering again!  I've been here 4 times now, and it's always good.. A+ for Guu.."}
{"text":"Love this place! My sister and I were on a road trip and stopped in Toronto for one night. Went here for dinner and couldn't have been happier with our decision.   All of the food was delicious - we had many small plates. The atmosphere is super lively with friendly staff that collectively (along with the restaurant patrons) greet you when you walk into the restaurant. We were immediately energized and had a great meal. Five stars!"}
{"text":"If you want to go out with friends for a few drinks and some great food in an informal (and pretty loud) environment, this has to be one of the best places in the city (and one of my favorite restaurants).  Although you'll be stuck in line for far longer then needed, the wait is well worth it!  The food is extremely interesting, funky and original. Some recommendations include the seared tune/salmon, oysters with mushrooms, and spicy shrimp.  You're going to love it I promise!"}
{"text":"Good experience here!  Some tips for future goers:  1. When people say this place is loud, trust them!! It is booming inside. The servers and chefs all scream greetings and goodbyes in Japanese when customers enter and leave. So don't come here if you're easily susceptible to migraines unless you can get a table on the patio.  2. Order the karubi (beef short ribs). They are to die for.  3. Do not order the octopus balls. I'm confused as to why people recommend this dish? The batter around the tiny piece of octopus is soggy and odd tasting and the sauce it's covered with is overly sweet.  To be honest, I've heard a lot of recommendations for the kinoko bibimbap but I actually just thought it was okay. Would try the yaki udon next time.   Honestly, I would like this place better if they didn't scream every single time a customer left or entered. I get that it's part of the experience but it seems a bit unnecessary. Other than the loudness, I would definitely recommend the food!"}
{"text":"Always great: I've come here for just drinks, drinks and snacks, and dinner on multiple occasions. Staff are lovely, food is great, fantastic design, just love it. Truly a nice izakaya experience."}
{"text":"This is the type of restaurant that I would be satisfied to have my last meal in. The food is amazing, the service is incredible, and the whole experience is something you would want to experience over and over again. You feel like instead of having dinner, you are part of an entertaining dining experience. There is yelling, waving, interaction among all patrons. The place is small, so you will probably need to wait, unless you show up before it opens. If you haven't experienced Guu, then definitely go and experience it today."}
{"text":"Kinka was highly recommended by my sister-in-law. She had already warned me that it's a very loud atmosphere, but I didn't expect to be greeted with a Japanese battle cry upon entering the restaurant (the norm at Kinka)! This is not a place to bring your grandparents, people.  I liked that they offered daily food and drink specials. We ordered a few special appetizers: two pieces of wagyu beef onigiri (rice balls), salmon belly carpaccio, and yellowfin sole tempura. They were good but the other dishes from the main menu were better. We did the tasting/party menu #A (8 shared courses for $25pp). Note: this was plenty of food (we were even warned by our waiter); we definitely did not need to order the additional appetizers, oops.  Fave dishes:  1. KARAAGE CHICKEN - my first time trying Japanese-style fried chicken and I like this way better than chicken katsu. Seriously, can I get that in a bucket-size? 2. FRIED BRIE CHEESE with fruit jam dip - upgraded version of mozzarella sticks, so simple yet so amazing. 3. KINOKO BIBIMBAP (mushroom & cheese) - for a vegetarian dish, this was incredibly tasty, full of umami flavor, and gotta love the crunchy rice texture.  Service was MIA at the beginning, but improved over the course of dinner. Although there were no windows or natural sunlight, the interior was brightly lit and warm. Definitely a party atmosphere - great for groups. If you want a quieter dinner experience, then request patio seating, weather permitting."}
{"text":"Been here for couple of times, had my birthday hosted here, never disappoint!  Service is amazing, food are amazing, and top notch ambiance.   This is the spot where you feel like you were really in Japan. Servers would shout at you as their greeting ritual. Food are tapas style, shareable, so do come with friends. Prices are reasonable for their serving size. Great 80's music, amazing alcohol selections. Loved their plum wine each time."}
{"text":"This was definitely one of our best meals in Toronto. Wait time was minimal as we arrived early. We ordered drinks while waiting and were surprised at how low the prices were but soon discovered that was because there is next to zero alcohol in them. My husband gets the Asian glow like nobody's business and there was no glow here!  Ordered a multitude of different items to share and we polished off every single one. I'd have to say the one with the raw egg mix wrapped in seaweed was a tad too salty - too much seaweed and too little filling, with not enough salmon in the mix to be able to taste it. Otherwise, very good, and we'd come back again.  Note: the chairs are pretty uncomfortable, they are just wood stumps/stools. Good for making sure you don't linger too long I suppose.   Baked oysters were outstanding."}
{"text":"Went here a few months ago and it was  a good experience.  Got there on a random Sunday 6pm and got the last table for two people. If you are more than two and less than 8, be prepared to share a table with someone else as space is extremely limited.   had the black cod ($10 each), chicken karaage, bibimbop.  Service is quick and efficient despite the chaos and noise of the whole place. Yes its is VERY noisy so it is not good for a first date. If you are claustrophobic, you're screwed.  Also to note, pop is NOT refillable and cost around $2.50/glass. My companion learned the hard way.  Quality of food is good despite the higher prices which I wouldn't mind paying. Will be back"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. I ate lunch at this restaurant and everything was delicious. Such a lively and positive atmosphere. This is now one of my favourite places to eat in Toronto!!"}
{"text":"My friend mentioned this restaurant about two years ago. I've decided to go to this place last year. The waiting is pretty long which is a negative thing but once you got to your table. The waitress are friendly. All the workers yell out to \"greet you\" when you enter and says their goodbye to you when you leave.  The crowds are always there everyday. That's why the waiting list is kinda long but since it is in downtown, you can walking around the downtown while waiting for a call from them. The foods are delicious and that made me really want to order more and going back again. My favourite dessert is the almond tofu. It is the most smooth creamier. I died and went to heaven when ate that dessert.  The bathrooms are very neat and in the women bathroom provides a mouthwash and a pack of females' personal need when you forgot your thing at home, do not worry! They have it ready for you.  The prices are reasonable. The dishes are amazing. The drinks are delicious as well. If you're looking for a Japanese restaurant, I would totally tell you to GO AND TRY GUU!"}
{"text":"found this on yelp, Thank you because we had no idea how crazy and awesome it would be!  Open the door and instantly smile with the warm welcome you receive. You can order almost anything on the menu and be blown away with flavor as well as presentation.  All of us wanted to drink the sauce from each dish thats how good everything was.  Try: Kaisou Salad Buta Kimchi Bim Bim Bop Everything else we ordered was on \"today's specials\"   Go Go Go!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome -- came in on a snowy Monday at 8, and it was packed, but seats opened up quickly.    Had a big mug of sapporo, edamame, takoyaki, yakiniku, gyu tongue, and sesame seed ice cream.  All quite good and authentic.  You're not coming here for sushi.    The atmosphere is superb -- loud, friendly, the servers shout, and the diners respond.  Definitely come if you're interested in a fun time."}
{"text":"You know what's awesome....when everyone, waitresses, chefs and everyone screams \"WELCOME\" and \"THANK YOU\" when you enter/ leave. Even though it's crowded and you sit close to people you don't know....it's a really friendly atmosphere. It puts you in a good mood and you enjoy food well. I really like that aout Guu....the non stuffiness..  The food is quality-like typical izakayas, they have staples when it comes to oden or yakitori, but they also have some signature dishes. The intestines and beef tongue were amazing! The mushroom fried rice was a great surprise...it had a really good deep, salty flavor. With the stone bowl, the rice had a good burnt crispiness to it so didn't seem heavy. The fried udon was good too....not too heavy, but a good sweet flavor.  The seared tuna was a little much...it was good, but not much of a Tuna taste.   It's one of the better izakayas I've been to inawhile. I think it's worth the wait of two hours too!"}
{"text":"Kinka Izakaya is overall an amazing restaurant. The combination of a vibrant and lively atmosphere with fantastic service and even better food make it (dare i say??) my favourite restaurant and the only 5 star i've given out to-date. Words cannot describe the experience of dining at Kinka, but hopefully it is enough to convince you to give it a try.  Sevice: 5/5 - as soon as you walk through the door you are greeted by all of the staff with a happy and loud welcome, and the same for when you leave as well. Waiters/waitresses and the chefs are all super friendly and approachable, often asking how your meal is.   Food: 5/5 - although i've only been to Kinka 3-4 times, i have never been disappointed with anything I order there and can only say good things about the food there. From the deep fried brie cheese, to the Karaage to the carpaccio to the horse tartar, everything I have had has been close to perfect. Every single dish has its own unique flavour and taste that really packs a punch. The food is made right after you order and there is very little wait time.  Price: 4/5 - for what you are getting, the price is good/fair. It is not too filling, but if you compared price points to other restaurants, i would pick Kinka 10/10 times. Overall what you get is well worth the money.  In conclusion Kinka Izakaya remains ny favourite restaurant. Not too pricey and amazing tasting food is guaranteed! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The wait can be a little long but once you step inside your promptly greeted by the entire staff with IRASSHAIMASE!!!! Love the atmosphere-high energy-loud! Solid drinks and food. There is a two hour limit but that's plenty of time to stuff your face!"}
{"text":"One of the best experiences I've had! You're greeted as soon as you enter, and the employees are lively and always shouting! They have birthday specials --they sing happy birthday loudly and the sake bomb! Includes a fun shouting ep.   Dropped by after work for some drinks and a few appetizers. Went with the okonomiyaki and the kaarage. As for the drinks, we got sapporo. I got a glass (16 oz) and my labmate got a big mug (1 L). Also ended the night with some green tea ice cream which was super good! Cheque came with some frozen grapes."}
{"text":"Always a great time for all, both new and returning customers.  I've been to the original Guu in Vancouver and can attest that the food quality here is on par.  Service is always friendly but be prepared to line-up if you don't make a reservation (so make sure you reserve in advance).  Make sure to have the Black Cod Miso, it's one of the best dishes on the menu IMHO. The croquettes are pretty tasty too, but man is that Black Cod good!"}
{"text":"It's really original, no questions and the food is very good. Located on a side of Toronto that is a mix of hip and questionable choices, this place delivers taste and the ambient is generally good. The loud music is sometimes annoying and the house water tastes \"different\" I liked and recommend the Hamachi Kama."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favourite, but now i don't come here often cause this place is way too loud.   Every time someone walks in or out, servers say something really loud in Japanese. It is kinda cool and unique at first, but it quickly gets really annoying. This restaurant is too loud to have a conversation.   Service here used to be really good, but now it is just mediocre. Maybe they focused too much on yelling and forgot what good service actually means.  Food here is pretty decent though. I love their takoyaki, yaki udon, and beef carpaccio. If you want to try something uniquely Japanese, get tako wasabi, which is raw octopus marinated in wasabi.   I would recommend Bloor and Bathurst location over this one. The other location is a lot quieter and has better service."}
{"text":"Not my favourite Izakaya, Guu has a pretty eclectic selection of dishes and an... interesting ambiance which certainly make it a unique place to take someone who doesn't live in Toronto.  That said, the same \"interesting\" ambiance is arguably what hurts it the most: if you just want a casual dinner or you even want to share a single word with your food fellows, don't bother."}
{"text":"I can't say enough positive things about Kinka. The fun atmosphere, the delicious food, the sake bombs and great service keep me coming back! Yes, make sure to make a reservation and know that there is a 2 hour dining limit however I find that it's sufficient time. They also now have a tasting menu which allows you to sample some of their best dishes and I think great value for around $30-35. My favorite dishes are their seared tuna, fried chicken, sesame paste spinach, oysters and udon (yes, it's a simple dish but always so comforting). Make sure to finish your meal with the almond tofu -- so smooth.  I would not recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a quiet atmosphere where you can converse because that is not going to be possible. A birthday celebration or a after work hang out would be better suited. They have also now opened a second location at Yonge and Sheppard -- it's more quiet however the food is just as good."}
{"text":"Japanese tapas? Yes please! Well tapas anything really...   I shared the Oden, the Pumpkin Croquette, and what I think was the Tonpei Yaki with my coworker here. Everything was excellent, though expensive. It was wonderful to try and I'd love to bring my husband here if we ever visit the area together.  But, it is incredibly loud in here. Don't expect to be able to bring a first date and easily have a get-to-know-you conversation."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday and called ahead to get reservations. Service is attentive and quick. Be prepared for the LOUD welcome and farewell every time a patron enters the establishment. The restaurant is smaller than you would expect, and guests are seated at long wooden benches to eat in small groups.  We ordered the prix fixe combo A for each person, which was more than enough food for a meal. They combined servings so that each plate was served to 2-3 people. The servings were generous and delicately plated. To note, we loved the kalbi ribs, beef tataki (delicious dressing), karaage (fried chicken - SUPER MOIST and TENDER), salmon tatake (smoky, peppery flavor to die for), tuna tartare, wasabi octopus appetizer (careful of the kick!),... so pretty much everything we ordered. The only dishes we weren't so pleased with was the fried brie (too heavy after the first one), and the blanched spinach (black sesame dressing too sweet).   Overall a great experience! Everyone was much more relaxed after the initial Sapporo and even joined in the welcoming of arriving patrons. Beware of parking on the street though - paid parking ends after 5pm unless you have a permit. There is, however, a parking lot across the street for around $7."}
{"text":"Great place for a boisterous outing."}
{"text":"I've been to all the Guus including the ones in western Canada and the newest at Yonge and Sheppard. The food is consistently terrific and well priced. My only criticism (which I understand is a core part of the chain's differentiation) is the noise. I know this is how some izakayas operate in Japan (which I've experienced first hand). For me I'd like to be able to chat with my company instead of hearing yelling, despite it being jovial. Some like the noise and seating arrangements. Whatever you fancy, the food is exceptional and you won't be disappointed no matter what Japanese items you enjoy."}
{"text":"So I went today with my good friend and fellow yelper, Linda T., today to Guu Izakaya after planning for about a month.  Today was a Wednesday evening, and I got to Guu Izakaya around 6:00 PM.  There wasn't as much of a line up as I expected, and we only waited for about 40 minutes.  A friend who came here before described Guu as \"a whole new other world.\" And boy, she was right.  Once you walk in they greet you with cheers to make you feel at home.  My friend and I were saying how this place was so cheerful that you always feel happy while you eat!  So we ordered the following: takowasabi (appetizer), kabocha korokke (fried pumpkin with egg inside), soy-sauce marinated tuna (off the special menu), aburi salmon, takoyaki, hotate carpaccio (scallop sashimi), and cheesecake of the day.  Here is my review on the following from my favourite dish to the last: 1) Takoyaki (octopus balls): I may be biased as I have an affinity for takoyaki.  I'm currently in search of the best takoyaki place in Toronto.  I've only been to two places for Takoyaki, Guu being my third.  So far, this is the best place for takoyaki.  The other two places had too much batter, and this was absolutely \"just right.\"  They also added a hint of wasabi to it, so it gave it an extra kick.  2) Kabocha korokke (deep fried pumpkin with egg inside):  Usually, I'm not a big fan of pumpkin, but I was thoroughly surprised by the taste of it.  It wasn't as fried as I thought it would be, but it was still delicious.  The egg in the centre was definitely a nice little surprise - but I didn't mix it in with the pumpkin that I had.  I think I might order this again just to see if they would fry it more or this is how it is.  Other than that, great dish!  3) Takowasabi: Small dish, but delectable!  The mix of octopus and wasabi was a great started to the meal.  Also included a bit of carrot, cucumber (I think), and some other things mixed in.  They provide some seaweed for you to wrap the takowasabi in.  4) Tofu cheesecake: Oh God.  I love my cheesecake, and this cheesecake was DELICIOUS.  I didn't put it as my first choice of the night, mainly because I wanted to put something  \"Japanese\" on top first.  However, the cheesecake was delicious -- not too heavy, and it just tasted a bit \"different.\"  My friend and I described it as \"bouncy.\"  Couldn't put our finger on it, but all I can say is that it definitely ended our meal well.  5) Aburi salmon: I thoroughly enjoyed the crunchy taste of the seared salmon mixed in with the sashimi taste.  Not only that, the green onions were a great addition to it.  6) Soy-sauce marinated tuna:  The tuna was amazing on the first and second tastes.  It went down smoothly like butter.   However, it didn't really stand out too much compared to the rest of the dishes.    7) Hotate carpaccio: The scallop sashimi was okay.  I've never had scallop sashimi before, so I might be a little critical about it.  Don't get me wrong, I like scallops - but usually cooked.  Nothing was horrible, so I can't complain!    They accidentally broke some glasses/water behind where I was sitting.  The boss was really nice and kind and gave us complimentary edamame on the house!  That was a great treat.  The ramune was absolutely amazing.  I was craving for it when I was heading back home.  When we got the bill, they gave us frozen grapes to end our meal.  The bill came out to about $50 with tax and tip.  Considering that we ordered so much, it was totally worth it.  When we left - more cheering and jeering once again!  If you ever feel down in the dumps and want to \"travel\" - just go to Guu and you'll feel like you walked into a restaurant in Japan!  Great experience!  We definitely come back once again!  Guu is guu(d)!"}
{"text":"Such a cool place! They yell japanese phrases all night. As soon as you walk in they all greet you very loudly. The menu is pretty extensive and includes many different dishes that all sound interesting and different from a lot of japanese food I've tried before. I tried the potato fries, gyoza, and unagi doria. All were very yummy! I'll admit that the yelling the servers do gets a tad annoying throughout your meal but it adds to the overall experience. Would recommend the sake bomb, not so much cos of the taste or the alcohol but because the routine behind it is so fun."}
{"text":"First time in Toronto and I was impressed by this place.  The food here is very high quality and price is decent.  Great atmosphere for partying but just prepare it. AM be VERY loud inside.  Definitely a 5 star in my book"}
{"text":"I am a repeat customer.  The ambiance is fun.  Given that the food is tapas style, you get to experience alot. I have had so many dishes! The ones worth yelping about are..  - Pulled pork - Sashimi salad - frie brie - beef carpachio - grilled squid  I go back, and will continue to! Although you do have to wait (no rsvp), its usually not that bad if the weather is nice."}
{"text":"This was a different experience...The first time I went, I was happy to be welcomed by clapping and 'banging' and to be seen off in a similar fashion. The portions are small, appetizer-like and since we ordered for the table, they went fast. The tab came to $40 each. It was a great evening."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The service was excellent. The atmosphere was unique and fun. I love this place."}
{"text":"It's fun and loud, just like a Japanese pub should be. The staff is very friendly and it's a great place for  bday celebrations.  The bamboo cocktail is delicious, can't get enough! Portions are small and you can try many different things. The salmon tataki, cheese & mushroom bibimbap and the fried brie cheese are some of my favourites. Check out their daily specials too!"}
{"text":"My fav jap food of all places in Toronto.  Definitely give this place a visit if you're looking for quality Japanese dishes. Don't forget to order a good bottle of sake to go with the food ;)"}
{"text":"This is an awesome experience. It's loud and boisterous and an amazing place to have a birthday party. This is the original location, and it's the better one by far. The kakimayo is delicious, but not for those who can't handle copious amounts of cheese. The ebimayo is also worth trying, as is the seaweed and tofu salad. If it's your birthday, they bring you a free almond tofu cake. YUMMMMM"}
{"text":"No complaints whatsoever. Brilliant food, great service, and ice-cold Sapporo on a hot day. We had the Karaage, Karubi and Gindara, which made for a pleasingly light meal.  However, a special mention must be made for the black sesame ice cream. While I have now eaten black sesame desserts at various places around Toronto, none of them, no pudding or ice cream has come close to how well Kinka have captured the flavour of black sesame. The texture and feel of the ice cream were smooth and perfect, and yet, the sense was of the flavour released when biting into black sesame seeds.   This in itself is reason enough to go back to Kinka, if not for trying out the other half of the menu!"}
{"text":"Loud and welcoming like an Izakaya is suppose to be.  (Hello white guy at Halu that told me to be quiet..I am loud though...)    Great selection of Izakaya style dishes including many pork and fish selections.  I wish they had kushiyaki but their extensive menu made up for it.  Mentaiko stir fried udon, good finisher.  Iced cold draft Sapporo.  Great service."}
{"text":"@KinkaIzakayaTO #YELPTO #KINKAIZAKAYATO #FOODIE #SALMON #TORONTOFOODIES  Heavy rains couldn't dampen our date night - I had a special foodgasm (and other gasms) planned. Once again, I had myself picked up; and now that we had already familiarized ourselves with each other, we touched each other a lot more. What started with a soft kiss, went on with him holding my hand while driving, as I directed him to the parking lot near Kinka. During the red lights, he either lost himself in my eyes or in my mouth - and lo and behold, we ended up missing our turns a few times.   The Church street location is really close to a $5 underground parking on Gerrard (right across from the Ryerson theatre school) - super convenient. We parked, got out of the car and I wondered aloud how we would make it through to the restaurant in the rain. He pulled me close and caught my breath in his mouth, lilting, teasing till he whispered that he had a solution; with that and a flick of his fob, he opened up his car trunk to a few large umbrellas and other goodies - usually gifts for clients, he said. How do you tell a man that you're dating that you'd really like one of those for yourself? I didn't and it's one of my biggest regrets.   We walked out into the streets, under the mega large umbrella he held with one strong arm, his other one around me. I blushed inwards; I loved how tiny I was by his side and the fact that his fingers were moving down my back embarrassed me a teeny bit. He turned towards me a few times during our walk, to pull me in for little kisses. We got to Kinka safe and un-drenched, but we had missed our reservation timing and the only seats they had available were at the bar. Also, their all season heated patio was closed as it is not leak proof. Who knew! I cringed, knowing that we wouldn't have a private spot to ourselves but we went along with it and I think it made for the BEST DATE SPOT.   We sat beside each other, very very close - and it was just another excuse to have our hands on each other. The chemistry was insane, his touch sent little shivers through my body. The date was over an hour so my body was receiving tiny pleasurable shocks through the evening. I wonder if he felt the same way. He was pleased with my pick - and he was overall impressed with the quality of service and food. As for me, I've always loved this place!   I ordered a sake mojito and he ordered a bottle of Japanese beer. We bent over the menu and made food decisions over stolen looks and kisses -  - salmon natto yukke that I've raved about enough number of times and he loved it too - beef carpaccio was yum - deep fried brie cheese which is usually good but was a bit of a disappointment this time - baked oyster with spinach and this totally stole the show (orgasmic)  - kinoko bibimbap was alright - more.  I'd like to blame it on the oysters that night, but maybe it was just us; perhaps it was the intimacy of the bar where you're forced to create closeness so that it doesn't feel too communal. While we sat and ate, the servers performed a rap battle and songs and it was super fun. We danced on our bar stools together and cheered them on. He took a video of the performance and us, and I felt more attracted to him than I ever had (if that was even possible).   It came to a point where he just could not even keep his hands away from me for a second, that's when we decided to pay and leave. I took care of the bill this time and he was super sheepish about it. I insisted - and it was truly a pleasure to take him out. BEST $100+ ever spent.   We speed walked to his car and he was happy to pay for parking. The wait of the drive to his place was almost painful after such a great night, for the both of us. Kinka will never be the same again, because this memory can't be beat."}
{"text":"I came in here on a weeknight so I didn't encounter the long wait like others might have. The warmly shouted WELCOME! and GOODBYE! by everyone in the restaurant really made my night.   If you are an awkward individual, you must go here; the way they greet you will make you feel like the most popular guy in the place. (until you realize everyone gets the same friendly treatment.) If you're not an awkward individual, go here anyway because the food is enjoyable and the alcohol.....well......everyone's so cheerful in here for a reason.  My friends and I ordered a couple of pitchers of beer and a few glasses of plum wine. Absolutely love plum wine. The alcohol list has plenty of choices to choose from, as it should, for a friendly drinking environment.   The food comes quick but in slightly small portions. Still, this is an Izakaya so don't expect big portions anywhere at this type of restaurant. Every single dish was prepared skillfully and I enjoyed every last morsel.  We had a Japanese friend in our party who highly approved of the place. He ended up treating three of us because we ran out of canadian dollars for the day and the banks had closed at 5 pm LOL. We sobbed and gave our thanks to him but we still didn't have enough to tip the waitress. Feeling extremely cheap, we tipped her all we had (which was still less than she rightfully deserved) and walked out feeling guilty because everyone shouted GOODBYE! so friendly.   I ended up having to come back here (HELLO!) because I lost my cell phone in the restaurant. The same waitress who served us, returned my cell phone from the lost and found with no contempt, only a genuine smile. (GOODBYE!)  Bless this place man. I still carry their business card everywhere with me, even when I'm back in the US. Everyone go here and give them business!"}
{"text":"Awesome energy, excellent food. The service is good and the staff make it a fun experience. At first I thought the noise and screaming would be bothersome but I quickly became accustomed to it and enjoyed it. Sake bombs are worth it for the spectacle alone. Definitely a fun place to go out with some friends. Atmosphere is the main reason to go but the food holds it own as well"}
{"text":"Went here with a big group and we were greeted and seated quickly since we made reservations. I'm glad we did because there was a line up around the building for this place. Atmosphere is loud but fun. I don't know much about Japanese food but this wasn't like what I was used to in sushi places. The quality here was much better and I don't even remember seeing sushi on the menu. That didn't matter because everything here was super delicious."}
{"text":"delicious and very spicy have some water with these hot dishes Liron Priborkin"}
{"text":"If you're ever in Toronto, you must visit this place. The atmosphere is loud and fun. Great place for large groups and lots of drinking involved. If you're on a first date, I don't recommend this place because you won't be able to hear each other. I came with two other people and the three of us shared: Salmon tataki Karaage Takoyaki Yakiudon Kinoko bibimbap: this was my favorite dish and we had two bottles of the mio sake."}
{"text":"It's exciting when you getba heroes welcome but after a while the loud atmosphere and constant screeming gets annoying. The food is really good thou, probably a better place to go for drinks or a group party but not on a date"}
{"text":"This place is so unique. It's fun full of energy and the food is fantastic -"}
{"text":"The food is really great. The place is a fun environment. I tried a lot of the things people have recommended. The octopus, the baked oysters, the bibimbap and I have came back since twice."}
{"text":"Food: Consistently good. Original. Others can't touch it.   Decor/Ambiance (indoors): Loud. Jovial. Communal.  Decor/Ambiance (outdoors): Quieter. People watching.   Service: Friendly and attentive. Can have waits between drink refills.     Recommends: parties of four or more, after work beers and snacks and a fun late night.   Value: 4/5. Some dishes can be overpriced, but overall in line with any trendy downtown spot."}
{"text":"Fun, loud (servers yell a Japanese greeting every time a new customer walks in), and energetic would best describe this place. Plates are small and shared. Menu is divided into hot and cold appetizers, salad, grilled, deep fried, etc. Many plates to choose from. Good food, but nothing you've never tasted before. Several of the dishes are drizzled with mayonnaise or have a mayonnaise sauce so mayo-haters might not be a fan. My favorite bite was the green tea cheesecake dessert. Sublime. I would go back and swap some of the savory dishes for more dessert plates. Really fun dining experience."}
{"text":"Sigh where do I begin. Me and my friends got the 35 a person tasting menu. It started off amazing, everything was good, service and food and then I found a dark hair fried into our karaage. We informed the kitchen got an apology and after that there was no more service to be found. We stopped getting checked on and we stopped getting our food. We were so confused I would think we would get better service because they would want to compensate for the problem. The manager eventually came over and tried to rectify the situation but I hate the idea of being asked like what we'd like to be compensated with I just feel like things go wrong in restaurants I understand but then it's up to the restaurant to take control and say we're going to do x y and z for you and make you want to come back. Rather than well there's a 20 percent button I can push does that help at all. At the end of the day it started off great, ended badly especially since I was the one who showed my friends the place so I wasn't really happy."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and will keep coming back. the atmosphere is fun and the food is delicious. I haven't had one bad dish here. It's a great place for a celebration dinner and for groups if you feel like a cheerful and high energy place.  It's also a great place to take people from out of town.   (don't come if you want a chill/quiet/relaxed meal)"}
{"text":"Came for my 26th birthday and tried around 10 tapas. Delicious!  The food was pretty standard of most izakaya. The ambience was lively and fun, although it's so rowdy and loud, it's a bit hard to have any sort of more meaningful conversation here. Would not recommend for any quiet date night occasion.   Most fun part of the night was doing the sake bomb... they bring it and teach you how to do it with some yelling and then banging your fists on the table to make the cup drop into your beer. It's very much a whole restaurant participation type of thing. Be prepared to get cozy and familiar with the neighboring drunk tables! LOTS OF YELLING GOING ON!  Fun place, good food, cheap beer, good selection of sake! What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly services. Very noisy and loud!  First of all, when you walk into the restaurant, you're greeted (aka yelled at) by all the servers and chefs working behind the bar. The atmosphere here is fun, loud, and lively. For my first time here, it was so loud that it dampened my experience at this place. For my second time, I bought earplugs and was able to thoroughly enjoy the food and the atmosphere.  First of all, you can do no wrong picking a random dish from the menu. My favorite dish was the tonpeiyaki which is a layer of semi-raw omelette topped with teriyaki and Japanese mayo sauce resting on a bed of bean sprouts and pork belly.   Their scallop with Japanese mayo is equally refreshing and the saba is very good also. The hotpot soup was extremely flavorful and you can choose up to six ingredients to go into your bowl of soup.   I also ordered the salmon sashimi which tasted very fresh and buttery. The hamachi sashimi was probably my least favorite because of the gristle. The karubi spare rib was also an average dish because they did not marinate the beef enough to let the flavor seep in. The baked spinach oyster was very creamy and fantastic.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant and I highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I liked the food and the nice ambiance of Kinka Izakaya, but my god this place is LOUD AS HELL and it's not due to the customer but due to non-stop yelling of the servers.   I came on a Saturday night and they told us the wait would be around 30 minutes, so they took down our name and phone number and they will text us when a table opens up. We then went out and walked around at the Loblaws nearby to wait for the text. It had been only 15 minutes when we were informed that a table for 2 opened up.   Well this is where we made our mistake. We were lead to the bar stools beside the open kitchen and I swear I have never wanted to leave in the middle of the meal so much. The servers and kitchen staffers would YELL out in Japanese whenever someone enters, leaves or puts down an order. Apparently I was informed by my friend to never let them find out that it's your birthday because they would yell constantly while drumming. We asked the server if we could change our seats because the yelling was giving us headaches, and near the end of the meal we were seating at the bartender's table, which was slightly farther away from the kitchen. So yeah, if you want some marginal \"peace and quiet\" at Kinku, remember to inform the server that you want a table when you make your reservation.  We ordered a bunch of food and a tasting of their Sake selection. My friend who had been here before told me that all their fatty and fried stuff are the best and I totally agreed. I really liked the deep fried brie cheese and the Karaage fried chicken. Their sashimi items were really fresh away and I liked the flavour, but the portions are really small. The decorative vegetable items on the dish tasted really good surprisingly and were good pallet cleansers. My friend who ordered the Sake said they were really good and he would totally go back for some more. The bill ended up being $75 in total after tax.  In conclusion, I personally wouldn't come back to Kinku again due to the noisy atmosphere, hence the rating deductions, but I really enjoyed the food that they offered."}
{"text":"Went here for a work lunch today and it is SOOO good. The vibe and energy there is super cute and fun.  I got many things to share with my lunch companions, and the highlights included the oysters, the black cod, this delicious rice and mushroom dish I didn't even see on the menu but was recommended by our server, and the oolong tea which was just so delicious on a very hot day. I'd wager that dinner is v v v cute here, but lunch was really great also, and pretty reasonably priced in my opinion, especially for the quality. If I lived around, I would definitely come back again and again."}
{"text":"I've never had truly amazing Izakaya, outside of Toyko, Japan, and San Francisco, California, until I stumbled upon Guu Izakaya! If I could open an Izakaya joint in the United States, it would be Guu Izakaya!  I happened to stumble on this small restaurant after returning to the Shangri-La Hotel on an empty stomach. And to my surprise, all the workers were Japanese and very friendly! To top it off, I was fortunate to come on the last night where they were in some type of celebration at the restaurant, where all the workers were wearing Kimonos!   Ambiance: You are instantly welcomed when you enter the building. There's always great music and the interior setting feels as though you're inside an authentic dojo.  Food: Two words to describe the food, \"DA BOMB.\"  Each dish is well-presented, similar to that of tapas. My favorites: Beef Carpaccio,  Takoyaki, Sashimi, almond tofu, chicken leg and lastly, green tea cheesecake!  Service: Their service is phenomenal. They treat each customer as if they've been coming for YEARS and make you want to return for just that experience.   A MUST GO IF YOU'RE IN TORONO..."}
{"text":"I feel like this one is a bit tough for me to review, because I wasn't entirely sure what to expect and it took some adjusting. Kinka describes itself as a \"Japanese Pub\" and that it will \"transport you to Japan\". It is definitely unlike any Japanese restaurant I have ever been to and is unique in many ways.   My boyfriend and I decided to order the Set Menu so we could try a variety of things we wouldn't normally order. It requires that everyone at the table also order the set menu and it is 36$/person.   Sashimi Salad- Delicious and light  Salmon Tataki- Fantastic!  Karrage- Delicious, moist chicken and the garlic mayo is to die for!  Kinoko Bibimbap- My boyfriends favourite of the night. (I personally don't like seaweed sauce, so I didn't eat any of it).  Kaki Mayo- This was ok, but I prefer raw oysters so it wasn't my favourite.  Gindara- Very, very good cod. Really enjoyed the grilled miso top, very different. Lots of small bones to watch out for though. Black Sesame Ice Cream- Different but a nice change.   There are a couple other items I have excluded because I don't really remember them, and I got so full that I didn't try everything.  The service was fantastic - our server was very attentive and helpful when navigating the menu.   Ambience: It is SO LOUD. The servers are constantly yelling and hollering and rumbling on tables, and I admit it was not for me at first. Especially because we were by one of the server areas where they are calculating bills, so they would be literally right next to our ears sometimes. To be honest, it might still not be for me. You have to go when you are feeling in the party mood; and are able to integrate yourself into the rambunctiousness. With that being said, when everyone started yelling and hollering and waving good-bye as we left, I did start to feel as if it were one big happy family--- annnnd it kinda warmed my heart.   Verdict: I would come back to try the Udon noodle dishes and more sashimi. I think that I would be a little more satisfied with dishes that are more typical of me to order. However, I don't regret venturing out of my comfort zone a bit and would definitely suggest to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Not only the food is great here, so is the staff and ambience!  As soon as you walk in this restaurant, the staff greets you loudly! A very enthusiastic staff culture indeed. We've also walked across this restaurant while it was closed and witnessed their staff being trained on these greetings!  In addition to its welcoming culture, their food is also very delicious. Haven't had anythign here which disappointed me. Make sure you get your reservations for weekends."}
{"text":"A good variety of food and drinks. Vibrant ambience. Good service."}
{"text":"Had a reservation beforehand but waited 30 min to get a table for that reservation, which was a disappointing start to say the least from a restaurant who boasts great service. Food-wise: Stay away from the kimchi bibimbap- there was maybe ONE piece of meat and one spinach leaf in there- the rest was all rice with kimchi sauce; I couldn't even find the kimchi. Also do not recommend the salmon avocado poke boat- it looks pretty but the boat is literally an avocado and bite-sized!"}
{"text":"I so wanted to give more stars. Let's start with the good. Wonderful tasting menu, well thought out. Wonderful disciplined flavors. A great value. The ambiance is very nice. It's a beautiful restaurant which really does give you a feeling of being in a Japanese restaurant versus a nondescript modern asian fusion place. That being said, this is clearly a young person's restaurant. The raucous ceremonies that seemed to be done every 2 minutes are deafening. Perhaps heavy velvet drapes might help."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is very busy and very loud so if you're looking for an excessively lively atmosphere, this place is it. Unfortunately, it's not a place to chat with friends as you cannot hear anyone over the excessive noise. I couldn't really stand the yelling and the screaming and trying to talk over everyone else. And don't expect to get full here unless you're ready to spend a crazy amount of money on food! It serves pretty much only tapas size dishes. We spent over $100 per person and left hungry! (We only came here because the birthday girl wanted to try it out) Never again!"}
{"text":"Awful experience here. Asked the server if the ramen would taste like peanut butter since there is peanut butter in the soup and she said no. Then when I got the soup it tasted like pure peanut butter. I asked to order something else instead or get it taken off the bill. The server Minzi was very rude and refused. The manager also refused. I will never be back here. That is not customer service."}
{"text":"GUU is no longer what it used to be anymore, yes that's exactly how I feel after my visit today. Menu was still pretty much the same and our server also provided us with the special menu for the night. Nothing on the special menu really caught my eye, and there was no introduction from our server, oh well we wouldn't be able to hear anything anyway... We sat down at the corner and the two of us almost had to scream at each other to keep the conversation going. Definitely not the place for a date or with a small group of people. I would still recommend it if going with a large party and simply get drunk by downing sake bombs, just don't talk.   Mio was the sparkling sake we ordered and I absolutely would drink that all day every day.   Their food turned out to be so salty that I had to keep drinking water after the dinner coz I constantly felt dry. And ya my throat still hurts from all the screaming...   Probably gonna take a break from Guu..."}
{"text":"I don't quite understand what happened here.  There isn't enough sake to make me feel better.  I had high hopes of this place.  The fried shrimp was great.  But I'm loss word words with everything else.  We took all the best reviews and ordered it all.  It was either too salty, overcooked or just not good.  There also is a difference between salmon and salmon belly.  So I kept to my hot sake tonight.  At least this kept me warm, happy and took away all my hunger for a little bit. This is the worse meal we had so far on our trip."}
{"text":"This place used to be really good, when I first reviewed them i gave them 5 stars but ever since new management kicked in, it has taken a turn for the worse. I used to come here all the time with my friends but last week was the last time and I noticed the menu has changed which is unfortunate because most of my favorites have been removed from the menu so I still ordered a few different things that I thought were decent and most of it was cold or under cooked, we even returned 2 of the tapas because it was horrible and the service was just awkward. On the upside they removed it off our bill."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out this place due to all the hype I had heard. My friend wanted to come here for her birthday. We had a group of seven and based on the way the seating works (as it is communal), we wind up sharing with another group of five.   Food was ok - not sure what the hype was. Almost 75% of the dishes had some sort of cheese in it.  This place is very loud so not ideal for catching up/talking. Not a great place to go if you have any gluten or vegan restrictions.  Interesting concept. Would definitely recommend to try this place once - but definitely not worth the 30- 45 mins wait."}
{"text":"Loud, noisy, and insanity!! Loved it, probably of the most memorable dining experiences I had while in Toronto! Would love to go back and celebrate my birthday with their saki bombs."}
{"text":"went to guu with a group of four. guu was awesome. we did wait in line for a long time, but it was worth it. food was delicious and fresh. i loved the gyumri carpaccio sooooooo good. our waiter was super friendly. the only thing that i didnt like so much was the sitting. u have to share tables with ppl cuz its so packed. liked atmosphere. it was relatively cheap considering our bill only came out to be 150ish including alcohol. would def go bak if im in town again!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"They've made a couple of improvements that vastly improve the winter wait.  They now have a fabric vestibule that helps to cut down on the wind and cold. That's good.   Now, when waiting for a table they smartly use their covered and unused patio as a waiting room / detention cell. It's a bit odd to be led through the main area into the cell, where you can have a beer and commiserate with others over the wait. But it works. Or at least it works better than waiting out in the cold."}
{"text":"I get why getting a table at this place is such a pain, it's awesome!  I usually dont have the patience for anywhere that has a wait time but Guu is worth it. The first time I went, my friends conveniently left out the screaming hello/goodbye part and I nearly hit the floor when we walked in. Once you're seated though, you totally get into it.  The food is to die for. Particularily the sea urchin. It was on my list of always-wanted-to-try foods and I was not disappointed. We had a birthday in our party and they sent over what could only be describes as a tower of flavoured liquor shots.  If you're looking for fantastic food and an electric ambiance, Guu is the spot."}
{"text":"Excellent food and a great atmosphere. With Kinton Ramen right next door, you'd think it would be a difficult choice, but Kinka's food is just far superior in my opinion. Everything I've had from here has just been delicious."}
{"text":"Super popular modernized izakaya in Toronto that opens late.  I was really hungry and was looking for hot food and found this chain izakaya in Toronto that's not too far from the subway so I went there, and found out the line is about 45mins - 1 hour wait.  My suggestion is to go approx 1 hour (or 1.5 hours before on weekday) as the waits usually die down around that time.  The food menu is extremely limited for an izakaya, but its adequate. It have all the essential elements of izakaya.  1) Sashimi -  uni/sweet shrimp/monk fish sashimi.  Fresh, but definitely not sushi restaurant grade, and you are not paying the sushi restaurant price either.  2) Fried Chicken - juicy, tender, but not salty enough.  3) Baked Oyster - Its pretty Americanized taste. Think of scallop dynamite with oyster instead.  4) Beef Tataki - I personally preferred Beef over Maguro tataki here.  5) Lobster Salad - Skip it, its very small portion.  6) Exotic Pork - Skip it, its nothing to write home about  7) Oden - order the daikon and egg, its sooo good!  8) Yakiudon - its really good, the scent of mushroom blended in with the udon.  Its one of my favorite dishes.  Try not to wear your fancy outfits here as your clothes will be stained with the smell of izakaya!"}
{"text":"Eating at Guu was an incredibly fun experience.   And yes, the food and drink were (mostly) authentic and quite good, if not perfect.   The service was friendly and prompt with spot-on recommendations. The ambiance was warm and a little quirky.    But what will stick with me from my Japanese small plates and sake-sampler dinner was the vibrant energy of the place.    It's kind of addicting, hearing friendly shouts around the dining hall  (in unintelligible-to-me Japanese) of welcome to all who enter, of orders from cooks to waitstaff, waitstaff to all, barkeep to no one in particular.  I left full and smiling.    And wanting more."}
{"text":"Every time we go to Guu, it's definitely an adventure, but an adventure where you know you're going to be very pleased in the end. The dishes are creative and absolutely delicious! Some of the best cocktails I've ever had. I really like mild, creamy cocktails that are not super sweet. I got the Macha Coco...it was DELICIOUS. ExACTly what i like in a cocktail. We also got this almond tofu cup for dessert and it was really different and delicious. Loved it. I always look forward to trying new dishes and cocktails whenever I go to Guu because I know I won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am a big FAN of ramen and Kinka Izakaya is always my go to place. They have 2 locations which i go to the most, and the food is as excellent as always.   10/10 Recommend!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent! It was our first night in Toronto and very rainy so we wanted some great food within walking distance of our hotel.  Of course we looked to yelp which led us to Guu Izakaya.    It was a little confusing as we first walked in, we weren't sure if we had come through the back door or not because we practically tripped over the coat rack and there was lots of yelling going on.  But we were quickly greeted and shown to the heated patio to wait for a table which only took about 20 minutes even though the place was packed and we didn't have reservations.  We discovered that the yelling and crowded vibe were all part of the experience, so just welcome it, the food is worth it.  I wasn't sure if there would be enough vegetarian options to choose from but there were plenty.  We also weren't sure how much to order, but they serve mostly small plates so the best way to order is to get a few plates for the table at a time, finish those and then order some more and so on.  We tried a bunch of things (veggie and non-veggie), every one of them was great but the stand out was the fried brie in mango blueberry sauce.  I want to head back to Toronto just to have this again!"}
{"text":"This place is AH-mazing, probably not for the older crowd becos it's very loud n they scream at u when  u coming in  n out..but,the food can be described as authentic japanese or izakaya street food..(so far I found) small portion so u can try every ill bit of everything and very tasty!! And price, affordable! Great place to hang out,chit-chat, amazing staff!everybody smiles!! U will never see any grumpy waitress like some restaurants,VERY CLEAN! Ull find FLOSS!!MOUTHWASH!TAMPON!!COMPLIMENTARY!!! That's how organized n thoughtful they r to the customer!!"}
{"text":"I've been there three times. And it has always been a good choice when I want to treat myself. The food is nice, not authentic, but definitely very creative and delicious. It's good to share with friends so that you get to try more different things.The cocktail though is not the best, I'd recommend just go for beer or sake. Atmosphere is great and staff is passionate."}
{"text":"This place was part of a theme of restaurants that I ran into that didn't have a lot of flavor with their food. The food service was good and the customer service overall was fantastic. Wait staff was impeccable. I'll give them a shot again for sure just because of that. Hopefully I'll find something I like next time."}
{"text":"What an amazing place. Good food, good atmosphere, good friends,... and so affordable. I strongly recommend trying once. The only bad thing is the wait. We were a party of 10 and we waited 1h 30min to get a table. And that was because I was hounding the host.  But I guess, when you're going to the it place,..; I guess you have to wait."}
{"text":"WARNING: DON'T COME HERE IF YOU DON'T LIKE LOUD NOISES, DO COME IF YOU LOVE JAPANESE BEER & FOOD.   First of all, let me just say that they have the best takoyaki in all of the GTA. All the other foods are pretty good, but do keep in mind their portions are TINY and so for the prices on them, this place can get pretty expensive without filling your tummies. However, the main point of this place is a bar, you come here to drink, socialize, and have a small bite to eat in between. However, while I love the lively atmosphere of the place, it can get pretty hard to carry out a conversation and I always come out with my throat sore from all the yelling over the people and blasting music (this is the part where they lost a star, the unbearable volume of the music).   Overall it's a great bar, but not suitable if you are looking Japanese food to make you full, if that's the case a better option would be all you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this restaurant but it definitely wasn't as good as I expected. FOOD: We chose the tasting menu as recommended to us by a coworker. We found many of the items were way too rich all served together - the fried chicken, baked oyster and deep fried prawn. These items seemed of lower quality and more like just average pub food items which I was not expecting. For example, the baked oyster was just cheesy mush which a couple pieces of oyster. Only one of these items would have sufficed - probably the deep fried prawns. The beef salad (gyu shabu salad), beef short ribs, okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake) and kimchi bibimbap were all quite tasty however. I would recommend to get these items and forgo the tasting menu. It's just way too much food and completely unnecessary.  SERVICE: Another disappointing aspect of this place was the service. They shove all of your tasting menu items on the table at once instead of pacing you, so you're kind of scrambling to eat all of the hot items before they get cold. Our server also spilled beer all over our table and said sorry but then didn't clean it up and just walked away.   ATMOSPHERE: Of course this place is really loud but it creates a fun atmosphere. If you want to have deep conversation, then just don't come here.   I definitely would not return to this place as I find the price of the food just does not match the quality and taste, plain and simple."}
{"text":"I ordered too much food that I can't remember exactly what I ordered. All I have to say is the environment is so festive and so fun to be in that I enjoyed having dinner there. I celebrated my friends birthday here and we asked if there's something they can bring us and they brought out shots for us. They wrote happy birthday on the board and sang to her. They also took a poloroid to give to her. So nice!!! You'd think because they are so busy that the food would be just alright but the food was actually quite good! I really enjoyed every dish. Everything was tapas style so we tried to split the small plates with 7 people. Since we ordered a lot of food we were able to be full from our meal."}
{"text":"Wanted to bring my sister to experience dining in an Izakaya! A little different than the ones in Japan, they are definitely yelling way more than is normal in the ones in Japan (maybe as a show to us Westerners). Their food is also not truly traditional, but delicious fusion nonetheless.  Ordered: Samaaji (Jack Sashima - one of their daily specials) Maguro Tataki (Seared Tuna) Okonomiyaki Takoyaki Kabocha Korokke (Fried Pumpkin with Hardboiled egg inside) Gindara (black cod) Gyu (beef) tongue  Kinoko Bibimbap Green Tea Cheesecake  Everything was pretty tasty, especially the Kabocha. Gyu tongue was good but nothing overly special. The Okonomiyaki and Takoyaki were deep fried and not prepared the traditional way, but the deep frying gave it a very crispy texture. Green tea cheesecake had very little sugar but it was a great dessert regardless!  Service was great, price reasonable but not something I could afford regularly!  Not exactly the real thing, but close enough! Oishi!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a must visit and certainly unique outside of Japan. The atmosphere and loudness of the staff is a bit over-exaggerated I would say, but it is definitely a fun environment. The staff really give their best effort into creating a fun and vibrant energy, and it may be a bit much for some. I love the decor of the place.  Now onto the food. My visit was a while back so I don't exactly remember which specific foods we ordered, but everything was fantastic. The drinks were good as well, but a bit different. I believe the cassis orange was actual squeezed orange with soda, not what I expect but different and good.  The servers seemed kind but a lot of them seemed rushed and were running around like mad, which doesn't really feel like attentive service. They kind of assume everyone there doesn't have a clue about Japanese cuisine from what I gathered. The server also scoffed when I asked if they can do a beer with cassis, something I ordered in Japan."}
{"text":"Yelp, you did me wrong here.  First, those initial pics on this business page are professional pics and look mich better than what you get.  We were extremely disappointed.  We left half of our meal on the table, and sent one dish back.  The dish we sent back was the \"pig cheek\".  It was so chewy I couldn't bite through it and hold it with chopsticks at the same time.  It also came out cold so they kindly replaced this with the \"salmon belly\" (another special on the menu), which at best was shopping mall quality salmon and had a very off taste to it.    The server was nice, and his one recco'd dish was the fried mayo prawns.  Those were good.  That's the only thing good about or dinner.    The tuna was light pink in color, and not that nice bright red that good tuna looks like.  Bland in flavor.  The pan fried udon noodles were way over cooked and slimy.  The beef on top was not cooked long enough to be tender.  Also chewy like the pork.    The jellyfish appetizer was 99% noddles with a few tiny specs of jellyfish in it.  Absurd.  It tasted good as a noddle dish, but don't call it something it isn't.    We had the table next to the patio area, and it was cold outside.  It was fantastic that you let folks come into the restaurant and wait in the patio (for them), but for the table next to the door it sucked.  Every time it opens you blasted our table and the others with cold snowy air letting people in and out.  WTF?   The octopus balls had one tiny piece of octopus, and the rest was breading.  Pretty weak.  Way over salted and sauced to compensate for the lack of actual fish.  The black cod had bones in it.  Seriously?  The marinade was good, almost enough to compensate for the poor quality of fish.  It would have been a fantastic dish had the cut not tasted fishy, which is not good for a cut of black cod.  Bones?  Really?  The service is obscenely rushed as they try to get you in and out in the fastest possible way.  That's fine, but make your dishes worth it.  Our server apologized so many times for the pork dish it was uncomfortable. They did comp that dish and replace, but once we had 3 more dishes we didn't like, we just paid and left.  See the pics of bones from the fish and what we left on the table.    Not one bit satisfied.   This is glorified mall food, and not at all worth all of the positive reviews.  Possibly there's new management or a new fish supplier?  No idea, but this place was not good.  I hope this review saves you the trouble we endured."}
{"text":"Guu is one of my favorite izakayas in Vancouver, and when I found out they have a branch in Toronto (different name), I decided to make reservations for dinner at Kinka. If you are familiar with Guu, you walk in and get greeted very loudly in a very loud restaurant. We like sitting at the bar to check out the cooking action, so we opted for bar seating this night. We ended up ordering:  Oden: love the daikon and fried tofu (ordered it with extra soup)  Fried corn: not a big order, but tasty  Salmon belly and sweet shrimp sashimi: liked the salmon, but the little shrimp are just ok  Yaki udon: one of our favorites at Guu. It is served in a slightly creamy sauce, and the beef is very tender  I always have a good meal at Guu, and Kinka was no exception. You get good, reasonably priced food in a very loud and lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just amazing. Fun atmosphere and food was outstanding. Come here on a weekend for a great night out! Sake bombs are a must!!"}
{"text":"Best Japanese tapas I've ever had, but beware it's extremely loud.  You walk in and your greeted by the entire staff. When a chef completes an order, they yell, when someone orders a sake shot, you guessed it the staff yells.   We sat at the counter and witnessed the chefs cooking all the meals. Our area was hot!!   My party ordered the peach wine and it was sweet, it tasted like an infused tea.   We also ordered the yellow tail sashimi, calamari, bimbibop, karnage chichen, pork belly, octopus balls, and a grilled fish.   Everything was amazing!!! Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"great food, amazing ambiance, fast service, just long line"}
{"text":"A proper Izakaya. Always a warm Japanese welcome. Food is tapas style and a huge selection of drinks."}
{"text":"Tapas... Japanese-styles.    Atmosphere was warm, loud and boisterous; chefs yelling, waiters answering, voices raised to make themselves heard ...this was gonna be great fun.   Menu begs you to try something different. So many choices. Where to start? Our strategy: pick one 'safe' dish, then pick one dish you'd never think of trying.  Stand-out dishes:     \"SALMON NATTO YUKKE\" Chopped salmon sashimi with 7 friends (Natto, shibazuke, takuan, wonton chips, garlic chips, green onion and raw egg yolk). Mix them up and wrap it in NORI seaweed.    \"BUTAKIMCHI BIBIMBAP\" Rice, spicy ground pork, kimchi, assorted vegetables & an egg in a hot stone bowl   \"MAGURO TATAKI\" Lightly seared B.C. albacore tuna sashimi with ponzu sauce and garlic chips    Honourable mentions:  \"IKAPIRI\" Deep fried calamari with spicy ketchup and wasabi mayo \"Grilled SABA\" mackerel with garlic, lemon and herb on vegetables    It pains, but easily forgettable:     \"KABOCHA KOROKKE\" Deep fried kabocha pumpkin croquette with a boiled egg inside      fyi: 2-hour time limit   And until the hype dies down, go early. Or you risk waiting. And they don't take your #, tell you to go across the street & have a drink while you wait. You just wait."}
{"text":"So delicious and so much fun. I visit every trip to Toronto if I can fit it in! This place is great for groups. Not quiet if you're looking for quiet. But you will have a blast!"}
{"text":"Kinka has been my go to place for years, even in its prime days when it was called Guu.  I've had many great dishes there and to list all of them, it would be a very long review.  But basically, this is a fun restaurant to go to on a late night if you want Japanese style tapas.  Their small dishes are not cheap and if you are going in hungry, it can become one expensive meal.  However, everything we've ordered has been very tasty.  Some of their highlights include lobster sashimi (which they have in the summer sometimes), their almond tofu (to die for), and their karaage chicken (because who can go wrong with fried chicken)?   This is certainly a very loud place to be at with all the patrons talking and the waiters and waitresses yelling every few seconds when someone comes in.  It does make for a happy environment but if you have a migraine that day...definitely don't come!"}
{"text":"Guu is the hottest little piece of culinary wonder to have hit Toronto in a really long time. The buzz about this place has been absolutely ridiculous. I am not really a follower in this aspect, usually I would just get disappointed and feel ripped off. Guu was really a great surprise for me. A girlfriend and I have been eying this place for a while. Usually, I would wait until all the hype dies down but for this restaurant I don't think it's going to die down anytime soon. Regardless of the day or time, this place is always packed but trust me the wait was absolutely worth it.   I guess what made this place really stand out is the environment. Once you step through those doors, you are literally transformed into a different world. It felt like you just nested into the heart of small Tokyo bar. This place is really ALIVE with all the sights and sounds of what a real Japanese restaurant should be like. Just on the environment alone, I already fell in love with this place. I wish we sat at the bar however, it would be so fascinating to watch the cooks & staff interact with each other. They seem like the really love what they are doing and  just by that, you know the food would definitely deliver.  So, we ordered a couple of things. Here's my take on them:  TAKOWASABI: You have to be a true fan of wasabi to like this dish because it really hits you in the face.   ABURI SALMON: The texture of this dish was amazing - the salmon melts in your mouth and the fried onion chips really added that extra something-something to it.  HOTATE CARPACCIO: I loved this dish, it was light and refreshing but I really wish we got this dish first. With all the other overwhelming flavours of the other dishes, this dish found itself on the bland side. Pity really because the presentation was beautiful.  SOY SAUCE MARINATED B.C TUNA: Literally MELTS in your mouth but it didn't stand out to the other dishes. However, still some of the best tuna sashimi I've had to date.   TAKOYAKI: MUST MUST MUST try. Once I had one, I just wanted more.  Enough Said.  KABOCHA KOROKKE: This is probably my favourite dish, maybe because I am a huge pumpkin fan however, I was slightly disappointed. I was expecting the outside to be a lot crisper. Maybe it was just ours. Will have to try it again!!   & TOFU CHEESECAKE: Yum. Yum. Yum. Period.  It was just overall an amazing experience and I really can't wait to head back. There's still a lot on the menu that I would still love to try out. Although the food & environment was amazing, the icing on the cake was the staff. They were fast and ran like a well oiled machine. The waiters were cheerful and helpful. A small incident happened at Guu, a waiter accidentally broke a glass bottle behind my friend and in literally 10 mins, the mess was cleaned up and the boss came out to apologize and offered us some complimentary edamame. That, there my friends is what you call superb customer service.   We ordered 8 things and it came up to be $50 dollars. Honestly, thats an amazing deal for the quality and services Guu provided. Folks, all that hype from this place is there for a reason. Guu is really really Guu(d)!"}
{"text":"Lively Rambunctious place, its loud and energetic, so if you want a place to talk and laugh it's definitely a place for consideration. Highly recommend the salmon natto"}
{"text":"Drinks: Some cool drinks and original flavours. I really love the personal size bubbly bottle! It's so cool and I haven't seen it in other restaurants yet. Prices are on the average/lower side.  Food: I personally didn't really love the food although it wasn't bad either. I am a pretty picky eater so some people might think the things I didn't like about the food are irrelevant for most people.   Service: Super quick. The waitress and busboys were super energetic and friendly. Definitely 5 star service."}
{"text":"What can I say about Guu that hasn't already been said?  Yes, you will have to wait for a table. Yes, after waiting you will probably have to share a table with strangers. Yes, it will be very loud.   Yes, the food is awesome, and you will probably eat a lot of it. Did anyone mention that the servers are cute?  If not, at least I contributed something new.    A great experience.  Go."}
{"text":"Great place for a get-together with friends, love the vibe in here.  You really can't go wrong with any of the dishes, but some of my favourite are the sashimi salad, oyster and bibimbap."}
{"text":"Usually come here for dinner and this place is always lively and food is always delicious.  Came here for lunch yesterday and the service was very absent and our waitress was not attentive. We ordered Bamboo cocktail which was disappointing as it tasted like diluted lichee juice with pop.  The lunch menu is more limited than their dinner menu and I was still hungry after our meal. The service was disappointing and maybe it's just because there are so many stores open now."}
{"text":"This is the first and only Izakaya-type restaurant that I've been to and it's great! I've been to this location three times and my friends and I have ordered the following:  Pumpkin croquette Fried chicken pieces Tuna tataki Bibimbap (cheese and kimchi) Yaki udon (beef and cheese)  They've all been absolutely delicious. The most memorable for me was the udon. I haven't had such flavourful and chewy udon noodles at any other Japanese restaurant before!  They tasted so fresh. I would definitely go back to order any of the above items again.  The atmosphere is very unique. Everything is made of wood and it almost feels like you're in a barn or cabin at times.  The noise level is very loud. It's so loud that if you're going with two other friends and you're sitting at the bar in a row, you wouldn't be able to hear anything your farthest friend is saying! Luckily for me, I haven't had to wait too long during the three times I've been.  I can't wait to go back there again!"}
{"text":"My first izakaya place. I went with three other people and they were full but luckily they had some patio tables still available. Staff was nice and informed us they were down a server tonight so service might be delayed. Was not a problem for the meal. Our table on the patio was in a separate are away from the yelling and bustle which was fine by me. The patio was also heated so it being winter was not an issue. The food was good but not spectacular. We got around 12-15 tapas. Some highlights for me included the udon, fried chicken and short rib. The yakitori and calamari were kind of soggy and not crispy. I would be cautioned about how loud the normal eating area is. Not the best place for conversation. Price was reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"Guu, the Japanese restaurant that people raved about and I waited 45 mins to get in. Was it worth the wait? The first time perhaps, but not again!  My friends took me here for a treat! I do like the tapas concept of trying various things and sharing it with your company. First we tried a dish with a raw egg, which was unique and tasted good, the rice bowl with mushroom and cheese was my favorite and my must try dish on the list. The pumpkin balls were different  and ideal for vegetarians. This place is great for people who want to experience new flavors and have a lighter taste palette The dishes were not spicy at all but still had sufficient flavor. Great for groups who are comprised of both herbivores and carnivores!   Personally I liked the ambiance and the experience more than the food. I guess people over hyped this restaurant , I would certainly recommend trying it, and I will go again to try the oysters and other dishes, but I am not willing to wait over ten minutes.   Also I could not stand people yelling hello and goodbye every min! It disrupts the conversation and frankly annoys my ears!  I am rating this place a four star primarily due to its variety of dishes!"}
{"text":"A very entertaining place , with awesome authentic Japanese food . Fun environment . Very friendly staff , who make you feel very welcome there .  A very typical Japanese style ."}
{"text":"I'm sorry I'm going to have to disagree with all the glowing reviews here. This place is just not worth going to. First off, what is all the hype with an izakaya anyway? From what I saw, they're supposed to be some small neighbourhood watering holes for japanese business men. And when you come in there aren't 13 employees yelling to greet you.. there's like.. 2 or 3. The concept of needing to wait in line to get into such a place is ridiculous.  This place is way too effing loud. Too loud to have a conversation loud. That's annoying.   Ok, so with all that out of the way, an assessment of the food. Meh. Sure they can batter and deep fry a piece of chicken pretty well, but how hard is that? I ordered a miso soup. $3 for a portion size that is about half the complementary one you'de get at even the worst sushi restaurant. I tried the grilled cow tongue. It was dry and looked and tasted like it had been sitting around for at least an hour. Not impressed. Most of the other dishes weren't all that memorable either.  We ordered another round of dishes, and the waitress forgot about some of them. weak.  C'mon, seriously, what is the deal with this place?"}
{"text":"I went to Guu Izakaya for the first time and I was not disappointed. The food here was exceptional. Ordered: yellow tail sashimi, salmon tataki, maguro tataki, gyu carpaccio, kinoko bibimbap, yakiudon, saba, green tea cheesecake, matcha green tea crème brûlée, brie cheese, kakimayo, and okonomiyaki. The sashimi was so fresh, it was unbelievable. I enjoyed everything; however, the yakiudon, okonomiyaki and the saba dishes were very salty. Furthermore, the mojitos were also very good! Ordered peach mojitos.   Although, the food was really good.. the atmosphere was very lively which was nice to see. Really great to see this restaurant open to 1 am on the weekends. This is definitely the place to go late at night. However, one down side to this restaurant is limited table space (very small tables for a group of three) and the chairs cannot hold your jackets. You will have to put it on your lap or hang it on the rack.    The bill racked up to a hundred something dollars but it was worth the splurge."}
{"text":"Fun place to eat and drink.  Warning!  It is loud.  Lots of shouting and saki bombs.  Not the best place to have a quiet dinner but if you're looking for excitement and good food, Kinka is good.    The food is delicious.  I got to try their gindara , kimchi udon, mushroom udon, tuna tataki, salmon tataki, karaage, gyu capaccio and brie cheese.  My favorites were the tatakis.  The fried cheese was my least favorite.  We were stuffed by end of the dinner.  Drinks were good.  Sapparo on tap.  Sake in a bamboo.  Everyone has this!  The sake goes down pretty easy.    If you're the table next to the door, it may be cold.  Service is good.  Servers were attentive even though it was busy.  Enjoyable experience at Kinka."}
{"text":"They no longer let you pick which oden you get, even though they're all the same price. The whole point of coming here as opposed to the Real Guu was for the oden.  No point of me coming back"}
{"text":"This place definitely lives up to the hype. A large part of the reason I'm giving this place 5 stars is because of the fun atmosphere, excellent restaurant experience, and the servers are very friendly, polite and enthusiastic.  All of the restaurant staff (about 10 or 15 of them) cheerfully yell greetings to EVERY single person/group of people that enter AND leave. They make you feel really welcome and like they are happy to see you and hope to see you again. Also, if it's your birthday, all of the staff will stop what they're doing and sing happy birthday really loudly to you, clapping and everything.  Although I am a vegetarian, I still really enjoyed all the veggie dishes I had: miso eggplant, deep-fried brie with blueberry sauce, tofu salad, kinoko cheese bimbimbamp, almond tofu, and sweet potato cheesecake.  It totally looks like I ate a lot but I shared all this stuff with 3 other people LOL. Most of the dishes are meant to be shared, I think. The brie was kind of heavy, because they are literally just huge chunks of cheese, but still delicious.  If you are looking to have a quiet, private dinner, you wouldn't want to come here. The restaurant is very loud with all the yelling everytime someone comes and goes, but it makes the atmosphere really fun and happy.  Do not try to make a reservation because they don't take those."}
{"text":"My friend and I came after work for drinks and food. Since there was only 2 of us, we only ordered a few from their staple menu, baked oysters, takoyaki, karaage, bibimbap with a pint of beer each.  While the food came out mostly delicious, the portions have changed - especially apparent in the size of oysters, like one was significantly smaller than the other. The takoyaki wasn't crispy at all on the outside, the chicken sizes weren't similar so a few pieces came out a little pink on the inside.   The server was a bit hard to flag down, but the few times she came to our table, was friendly and helpful. I'll probably still go, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"We had a great time when we went to Guu. If you don't show up early though you'll be waiting a long time for a table"}
{"text":"Good food. Atmosphere would depend on person some people really like their atmosphere. I personally don't really like the really loud atmosphere they have. You also have to sit with strangers on same table which is a bit of a turn off."}
{"text":"This place is always busy with line ups out the door literally especially on fridays and saturdays so come early as they dont take reservations.  This place is good and pricy but after coming here over and over, its getting boring....dont come here with an empty stomach because you will literally be spending at least 50 bucks a person as the meals are very small....atmosphere is LOUD as the waiters and waitresses are constantly screaming when people are going and leaving."}
{"text":"After trying to go here twice and being put-off by the long lines, I finally ate at Guu. My friend and I just happened to be walking past the restaurant at 4:30pm and noticed that a line was already forming outside the door. They open at 5. So this is why I've never been able to get a table!! (Although the patio is now open so hopefully the increased capacity will translate into shorter waits. Also, there is a 2 hour time limit.)  Anyways, so we decided to go right at 5 and were welcomed with a very loud \"IRASHAIMASE!\" Having just returned from traveling Japan, the atmosphere of the place and the friendliness of the staff brought me right back to Tokyo. I kept having the urge to bow and respond with an \"arigato gozaimasu\" every time the servers came by. Definitely authentic in the vibe and excellent service, although most izakayas would not have bibimbap on the menu! Also, true izakayas are supposed to be cheap! The prices at Guu are fair, but if you're really hungry, it would cost you quite a bit. We weren't all that hungry; it was only 5pm after all!   Neither of us are big beer drinkers, so we opted for the sake-gria instead. A nice twist on a summer classic, but nothing special. Then onto the karaage - deep friend chicken with mayo. It was yummy, even if some of the meat was kind of fatty. Then again, almost anything deep friend tasted good right? Next we sampled their okonomiyaki, which is very thick and cut up into pieces (different from the style at Okonomi House where it's served on a hot plate). Not exactly like the ones I tried in Japan, but equally delicious with the okonomiyaki sauce and mayo. Finally, we finished with the yaki-udon, served with thin slices of grilled beef and plenty of vegetables.   So... definitely a unique dining experience in Toronto (we so need to catch up with Vancouver, which has several excellent izakayas) and I will be sure to pop by whenever I have a craving for authentic non-sushi Japanese food. However, the hype and crazy line-ups are a bit over the top...!   P.S. For another authentic Japanese restaurant, I recommend the less-trendy but delicious Tokyo Kitchen. Although they serve sushi and sashimi, their real strength is their deep fried appetizers (their karaage is better than Guu's IMHO) and Japanese curries! Yum!"}
{"text":"Came in right when they opened. We were warmly greeted when we came in. When we were about to order, staff was always around. We didn't need to try hard to get their attention. The food was great!! We ordered tuna tartar, beef carpaccio, calamari, okonomiyaki, jellyfish, and baked oyster. All were good, but the jellyfish was the most interesting. I would definitely come back. While we were there, it was someone's birthday and they sang very loudly. The service was great, the food was great, and we had a fun time"}
{"text":"Tired of always hearing your friends say, \"lets go our for Japanese food!\" and just ending up in a Sushi joint?  I know I was.  It's like saying \"Lets go to an American Restaurant\" and showing up at a place that only has burgers and fries.    There's more to Japanese cooking than sushi.  For one - there's okonomiyaki.  And, while delicious, it's one of the rarer beasts in Toronto.  The okonomiyaki at Guu Izakaya is Osaka style, and fulfills the flavour craving like nothing else will.  If you're a fan of having a group of people yell when you walk in the door, then this is the place for you.  Needless to say, if you're a fan of people yelling at you when you walk in the door, you'll love it even more when they yell as you leave.  It should be noted that if you don't show up just as it opens, you can prepare for a one hour wait.  And you should also be prepared to drop at least 25 dollars a person.  I would recommend two or three orders per person.  They're not as big as one would like, but it's Japanese food done right, and it's delicious.  Have a problem with the restaurant?  Use the notebooks in the bathrooms to write comments, or just draw ridiculous pictures.  Provided you're not one of those people who is too scared to touch anything in a washroom.  Don't worry - the soap is only a few inches away."}
{"text":"Thought I'd update a bit since I went back last night. 1) wait times are usually upwards of one hour in my experience. There is a starbucks at yonge and college (5min walk?) where I like to stay while I wait. 2) If your group is three people or more, they will take your number and call you when your spot is ready. Otherwise, you're left to guess when you should head back. 3) I don't know what people are saying when they say service is fast. food comes pretty slowly. it's all cool, you can talk and take in the atmosphere while you wait. 4) cheque usually comes with some delicious munchies--I got frozen grapes yesterday!"}
{"text":"Best Japanese dining experience! It's a great place to celebrate birthdays with your friends and even for a date night. The tapas are so delicious and unique. The service we received from the staff is excellent! I recommend it 100% and would come back again."}
{"text":"This place was just okay. They were out of the special that we wanted. The food was decent but a bit overpriced and small portions. The atmosphere is lively and loud but borderline obnoxious. The service was bad. We had to ask for the check 5 times and sat for over 20 minutes with empty plates waiting for our server. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Haven't been this disappointed in a long time.  After reading such hype-y reviews and hearing about this unique experience from friends (admittedly, they went when it was still called GUU), I decided to give it a try.  1. overpriced in every way 2. A few items that I actually wanted to try were no longer available. Not for the night, but apparently taken off the menu permanently. Then WHY was it still on the menu? 3. I'm not going to even try to pronounce or recall the names of the dishes, but basically I got seared fish with sauce on it, udon noodles with light sauce and mushrooms, and an oyster with cheese. All thoroughly underwhelming, with no discernible authentic taste. It seems as though they grabbed regular dishes and added another garnish on it... not necessarily for the better and definitely not a creative or satisfactory experience.  Not worth it. Energy of staff is good though."}
{"text":"I thought this place was just okay.  I came on a Saturday around 9 pm with a party of 3 and luckily only waited ~5mins.  To start, don't bother ordering any cocktails. Ours (cassis peach cocktail and peach mojito) came out tasting like straight up water... -__- so maybe they're weak, maybe their cocktails are heavily watered down..but either way, I don't believe in paying $7.20 for water.  We tried: -Takowasabi (marinated octopus + wasabi): put the mix on seaweed and eat it; the boys liked it -Gomaae (spinach and black sesame sauce): seemed kinda weird to order this IMO, but I'm glad we did - I liked it but would prolly skip it next time to have more room for other food -Maguro tataki (tuna tataki): I really liked this dish; my 2nd fave -Karaage (fried chicken): the bf's fave, but this honestly tastes nearly the same as everywhere I go, so I don't think this is a must-get -Ebimayo (fried shrimp covered w/spicy mayo): my faaaaave dish! -Kabocha korokke (fried pumpkin croquette w/a hard boiled egg inside): my friend's fave; I was really surprised by how much I liked this and recommend trying it! -Agedashi tofu (tofu in broth): I thought this was just okay..but they do give a generous portion of tofu -Kinoko bibimbap (cheesey, mushroom-y rice): I had a small bite and liked it, but I didn't eat more than that and wouldn't order again bc it's a filler food - and I know better than to order filler food! ;) -Teriyaki gyu tongue: I thought this was ok, a bit chewier than what I'm used to, and I don't like it as much as the beef tongue at Zakkushi -Kakimayo (baked oysters): these are huuuuuuuugeeee.. they come 2 per order, and the boys I went with seemed to like it  We also tried 2 other specials (some sashimi things, I think), and paired with the cocktails, the bill came out to $130.  Service was hit or miss - some waiters were friendly, others just wanted to go home.  Glad I tried Guu out, but i don't see myself coming back, esp not if there's a long wait."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. It's very lively since the entire staff is shouting greetings all the time. The prices are reasonable too. The karaage was very juicy and the saba had a nice aroma."}
{"text":"I've been to Guu out in Vancouver and here and have yet to be disappointed. The okonomoyaki is amazing as well as the sable, any of the carpaccio's are also delicious.   You are greeted as well as sent off in Japanese! I suggest going in a small group as you are seated quickly. Their patio is a great place to have dinner if the weather is nice.   Most dishes are small and you can share them, but only if you feel to! Pretty much nothing has disappointed. I suggest you go and go soon!!!!"}
{"text":"If you think you can handle a loud dinner, I suggest you come here. A wonderful greeting from the staff when you arrive and depart. I love coming here for the food and it's worth the ear ringing after. My favourite things to eat here is the: - Salmon tataki (seared salmon sashimi with ponzu, wasabi mayo, garlic chips) - Kakimayo (baked oyster with mushrooms, garlic mayo, and cheese) - Kinoko bibimbap! (rice, mushroom, cheese in a sizzling stone bowl) - Almond tofu for dessert!! Wow.   Special shout outs to the ebi mayo (shrimp with spicy mayo) and the deep fried japanese squid pancake (okonomiyaki).   Great place to share foods although the price can get pretty steep by the end of the night. Try to eat something before coming here."}
{"text":"I would not recommend coming here, and I will not be coming again. Ever since this establishment has changed its name to Kinka, the quality of the food has gotten worse.  Firstly, there is absolutely no need to drizzle mayonnaise all over the scallop sashimi. It ruins the delicate flavor and hides the potential lack of freshness in the scallop.  Secondly, we ordered the Angus Beef, a special in their menu, and I was dismayed that although the cut of beef and the way that it was cooked (rare), was great, it was drenched in a sauce that masked the flavor of the beef, garnished with a herb butter that did not aid in any means whatsoever the natural quality of the ingredient. Why serve such a beautiful cut of meat and then drench it in an overpowering sauce?  Furthermore, the loudness of the service on top of the blasting music, made for a very unpleasant dining experience. There is not a single Izakaya in Japan which operates within a senselessly loud, club-like volume of music. It is simply not necessary. People do not need to be yelled at. It adds to the stress of the service and the people eating the meal. Stop it. It is stupid. Thirdly, instead of highlighting the beauty of the tuna, yellow tail, and other sashimi dishes, it is constantly drizzled with sauce, and an unusual amount of garlic chips. Keep it simple. The whole point of Japanese cuisine is the simplicity of the ingredients, the quality of the ingredients, and a balance and equilibrium that is brought into the palate. Ever since this new ownership, which I suspect is korean, there are influences of this saucy, commercial Japanese food that lacks the true essence of a Japanese izakaya and restaurant.   The beer is good, the sake adequate, the takowasabi is good, and the BBQ pork belly is delicious.   For a more authentic izakaya experience, try Zakkushi. For a more izakaya/restaurant experience, try Kingyo.  Kinka has become like an expensive dance club - where too much noise within a small cramped space are accompanied by quality ingredients which are, in turn, destroyed by an overcompensation of additives, desensitizing the customer to an illusion of being fed. And you walk home with a sick feeling in your stomach and a large amount of cash gone down the drain."}
{"text":"Pretty solid spot for izakaya fare in Toronto.  My friend and I came for a late lunch on Monday around 1 pm. I had previously made reservations a couple hours beforehand just in case, but the whole restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived so they weren't really necessary.  They have a small outdoor seating area on their patio, which is where we opted to sit since it was such a nice day outside. I was pretty hungry since I hadn't eaten all morning, so we shared:  -karaage ($9.90): a little bland but otherwise delicious. Skin was light and crispy and it wasn't too oily  -okonomiyaki ($8.90): comes with 4 pre-cut pieces which makes it great for sharing. Thought this was pretty solid as well  -kalbi ($9.90): a little disappointed in this dish as the kalbi flavor wasn't very strong. I had ordered a bowl of rice to eat with this but didn't finish the full bowl, since the kalbi was a little bit blander than expected  -almond tofu ($4.90): my friend had never had this dessert before but he really liked it. Thick creamy tofu with a delicious almond flavor...yum!!  We ended up paying ~$60 for this meal for the two of us, which includes a miso soup and a cocktail as well. A bit on the pricey side for lunch, but hey, what's vacation for if not splurging? :D"}
{"text":"I went here on a Tuesday night around 10pm and although it was still busy, there was no wait for a table.  We actually took the bar because wanted to watch them cook.  They look like the friendliest bunch ever, they greet everyone that walks in and out of the restaurant.  They even chant in Japanese while they work, it's so inspiring.  And it kind of reminds me of how the workers at Lick's sing while they work except that it doesn't sound like these workers were being paid minimum wage and being forced to learn and sing songs while they worked.  Their attitude is spirited and friendly.  If I was the manager, I'd give them a raise!  I've never enjoyed a mojito so much and never realized that it was such a delicate and refreshing drink until I had it the Guu way, which is non-alcoholic.  I also like how their menu is so varied and unlike other Japanese restaurants there's no section where they list all the possible sushi rolls that they can make with the available ingredients.  I don't think this place can be compared to your typical Japanese restaurant out there, definitely in a different category on its own.  We had the pumpkin with egg, tempura shrimp, beef ribs, clams, some kind of bibimbap, lightly grilled salmon sashimi.  It was all fantastic, but very greasy.  It was definitely bar food, Japanese style.  It was such a unique experience, I think everyone should try this place.  Their service brings other Asian restaurants to shame."}
{"text":"I had their lunch special ramen and it tasted really bad I didn't even bother with finishing it. Took 2 bites of it and waste of $11 dollars. I had the shoyu ramen"}
{"text":"Guu is a popular spot. Arriving at 5 pm on a Friday, you'll be one of a line of people waiting for the doors to open. Once inside, you'll find yourself greeted enthusiastically (and loudly). It's a lively, noisy place, with servers shouting to each other in Japanese throughout your meal.   Many menu items are somewhat atypical compared to what you find at most Japanese restaurants in Toronto. It is known for its deep-fried Brie cheese and delicious tempura.  If you want to try something a little different and drop by Guu--just think about getting a reservation first if you go during peak evening/weekend hours."}
{"text":"This place is f'in crowded at 9p.m. on a Tuesday night.  They sat me at the bar...which was the beginning of the worst f'in service I've received all year!  Now I think I'll give this place a two-Meh, I've experienced better.  Congrats Guu!  Upon sitting, it takes the bartender 10 min. to ask me if I wanted a drink.  TEA! I respond...since it's so loud there.  Oh ok...nothing. I sit for 15 minutes...no water, no tea, no waitress...and I'm sitting next to the credit card machine.  Oh man...I'm giving this place a one star now!  This means I'm not going back...Why did I have to wait 15 min? Because every waiter I asked said it wasn't their section, and left it at that.  Ok, finally this woman shows up from no where...never seen her before...she's my waitress.  I order everything yelpers recommend.  1. Fried Chicken 2. Grilled pork cheek 3. Octopus Balls 4. Miso Soup.  Fried chicken was round...what part of the chicken is round? Definitely chicken...crisp was nothing like KFC...but not too bad or overpowering. Grilled pork...really tender and great with the hot sauce that came with it.  Perfect amt of seasoning. Octopus balls...never had it...but the filling was pretty warm and oozed like an eclair(I like eclairs).  Miso was nothing I had seen before....I believe from a beef broth.  Full taste also.  Will I go back? I left at 10:40p.m.  So if you have an hr and a half to waste....Welcome!"}
{"text":"If my tastebuds could have done a happy dance during this meal, they would have been partying nonstop.  This was one of the best meals I've had in a while-- not bad at all for a local chain!  Our party of five unanimously agreed on the set menu, and there were no regrets.  It's hard to choose favorites among all the flavorful dishes, but my top three were:  1) Kaki Mayo- similar to Oysters Rockefeller, but Japanese- style.  What's not to love about oysters covered with garlic mayo and a nice crust of baked cheese?  2) Salmon Tataki-  seared salmon sashimi covered with ponzu sauce and garlic chips.  Voted the top favorite at our table.  3) Ebimayo-  Deep fried shrimp smothered in a spicy mayo.  We also loved the deep fried Brie cheese that we ordered in addition to the set menu, because why would we pass on deep fried cheese?   We lucked out by getting seated outdoors; it was extremely loud inside.  Making a reservation in advance is highly recommended.  We tried to go back for a second meal and were turned away due to lack of space.  *Sad Face*"}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese izakaya. The only problem is it is extremely loud! But this is what a izakaya suppose to be :p"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time I spent a lot of money and the second time I had to line up for two hours in the cold before getting a seat. Even though it's loud and the seating is uncomfortable, I still love this place.  They have a wonderful atmosphere here. When we enter the whole staff will greet us and when we leave the whole staff says bye. The service is good considering the amount of people and the busyness of the restaurant.  The food is not a disappointment either! My favorite dish is the avocado with melted cheese on top (I think it's a seasonal item). My favorite drink is the bamboo drink (might also be a seasonal item).  I haven't tried the Guu on Bloor but I'm certain it's just as good.  This restaurant is a great example of how great service can keep a customer coming back even if the restaurant is a bit pricier and there is quite a long wait before getting seats.  Side note: there's a space underneath your chair where you can store your purse so you don't have to put it on the floor if you're sitting by the bar."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's so much fun and the food is fantastic. Order the Sake Bombs and get cheered on as you chug sake + beer. Order the deep fried brie, you won't regret it. It is a bit overwhelming though, the servers yell throughout your meal and it can be difficult to converse with your friends. Otherwise though, it's an entertaining and delicious spot."}
{"text":"Good food but sooo loud here! Would come back but recommend sitting on patio as the noise can get to be a bit overwhelming at times"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday with a few friends and loved it. The energy in the place is addicting. There's a great group atmosphere and the staff was really friendly. You don't want to come here if you want a quiet place to eat. The food and drinks were great! They come out as they are ready and they all tasted amazing. We had the sashimi salad, jelly fish, scallops, and a few fish dishes. We also got saki in a bamboo bottle and a few Japanese sodas which were also tasty. Will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"We were headed to another restaurant, but it was closed.  We had passed by here earlier, and when we were all wondering where to go, I suggested we go back here.  We were behind a couple who walked in first, and when I heard the loud cheering, I pushed everyone back.  She: What are you doing? Me: Just wait....and watch what happens.  We walked in and again, loud welcoming cheering.  It's really funny and kind of cool.  It might scare some people at first, but enjoy it!  Since we didn't have reservations, they sat us at the bar.  He: First time here? Us: Yes...first time to Toronto too!  Jingu(?) explained everything to us.  Since we were at the bar, we got to watch the cooks in action.  One woman seemed to be running the show.  When orders were called out, most of the cooks replied in unison.  So not only did we have dinner, but a show at the same time.  We ordered pitchers of very cold Sapporo.  Excellent!  We then just picked whatever sounded good.  The shortribs were a little tough and skimpy, but the karaage was fried perfectly!  Great seaweed salad with tofu!  The fried udon was a little slippery and a challenge to eat with chopsticks.  The pork belly was crispy and had a little spicy kick to it.  Everything came out in a timely manner.  The staff all spoke Japanese, even the token white guy...LOL!  Oh, and frozen grapes come with your bill....nice!  Now one of the best reasons why I'd come back, besides the food, as we were leaving, the whole staff bid us goodbye very loudly!  It made me want to go back in and then leave again!  This is a super fun place to come to, especially with a group of people."}
{"text":"Very festive atmosphere, great for groups. Expect a hearty crew with lots of cheering and greetings from the bar. We just kept ordering food and beer - everything was very tasty with very low prices!  Certainly not a place for the non social but solid eats with great drinks ( and picnic table style)"}
{"text":"We loved the atmosphere!! If you don't like loud, fun places don't come here!  Food comes in small portioned plates for lots of trying!"}
{"text":"If you're in any way an introvert that hates attention, OR one easily overstimulated by loud noises or crowds, I would steer clear of Kinka Izakaya. But, if you can roll with such things and you enjoy delicious Japanese food, I highly recommend this place.  When you walk into the joint be prepared, EVERYONE gets a welcome. There's shouting, cheering and more in Japanese. A lot of the seating is communal but we were lucky to grab a table for two fairly easily on a Saturday night. We had to wait about 10 minutes but a light stroll down the street kept us occupied until they called us to let us know our table was ready.   As the name suggests, it's izakaya-style dining, which means we plowed through a large number of plates at our table. Some highlights: salmon tataki (seared atlantic salmon sashimi w/ ponzu, wasabi mayo, garlic chips & scallion), the salmon collar, karaage (deep fried soy sauce marinated chicken w/ garlic mayo), and the karubi (grilled salt & pepper beef short ribs w/ scallion sauce). But everything we had was a winner.  Price isn't too terrible either for a special night out. For the two of us we walked out of there stuffed for around $70. I've certainly spent more on less food of lesser quality in Toronto, so this was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"After several visits to the Guu Sakabar location I decided to give the original Guu Izakaya on Church St. a try.  We went at 5:30PM on a Saturday aiming to avoid the rush, but the restaurant was already nearly full. We were seated at the last two available seats at a communal table. While conversation was made difficult by the loud atmosphere the food and drinks arrived within less than 10 minutes; surprisingly fast for how busy it was.  The Salmon Tataki ($7.80) was a slightly seared sashimi dish with about 5 small pieces. The salmon was clearly good quality fish, and the garnish added to the flavour. Would highly recommend this dish for salmon and sushi lovers. The Takoyaki ($5.50) was very lacking in octopus was. If there was more octopus in the takoyaki the dish would be significantly better. The Kakimayo ($8.50) was simply amazing. No complaints, even the portion size was good.  Each of us also got the Sake Tasting option ($14 for three shots). The sake selection was limited in variety and their best sounding option (the Junmai) was unavailable. I was pleasantly surprised by the dry but sweet tasting Guu'd Sake- it was the best of the three I ordered. Meanwhile the Izumi was dry and less flavourful, and the Gekkeikan was dry and a bit bitter. My friend had the Plum Wine Sake which had a soft cherry taste.  Overall it's a great restaurant with a very loud atmosphere. Fun for larger groups and for people looking for an authentic Japanese Izakaya experience. I recommend ordering at least two (different) dishes per person and sharing to get a nice variety. High quality food with small portions for the price they charge."}
{"text":"This place had tons of energy and great customer services with helping to pick out our dishes and how many for 3 people. The food was amazing. I highly recommend this place and I definitely will be back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"BEWARE. Agreeing with some of the bad reviews written here - being a long time supporter of Kinka/guu, I was so so disappointed with my experience tonight.  Kinka is going downhill. Ever since Guu changed to Kinka, I had this feeling that things don't quite taste the same anymore. I gave it a couple tries, but tonight just did it. Not goin to Kinka no more.  My experience: Karaage - half of the skins tasted burnt. the meat was pinkish and felt uncooked Tofu and seaweed salad - there were some yellowish/brown discoloration on one tofu piece. I remember how they used to have different types of seaweeds and daikon etc for a complex texture and taste. Today, it felt like a carelessly and cheaply made salad of iceberg lettuce with some store bought seaweed salad slabbed on top Mackerel - flavorless, overcooked oily fish with burnt fried garlic pieces Kimchi bibimbap - where are the veggies? other than 1 or 2 sad little spinach leaves and the pork pieces were rare and few. It seemed they just mixed in some sweet and sour sauce in rice cooked from a rice cooker.  I was going to give this just 1 star but I feel so bad for them"}
{"text":"4.5 stars  Spent a holiday weekend in Toronto and was looking for a jumping spot. We initially went to another Japanese restaurant up the road, but the menu wasn't that great. We left there and put our name on the list for Guu Izakaya. It was a fairly long wait, but the weather was nice out. It was packed!! We ended up grabbing drinks at a bar across the street.   By the time we got called. We had a table for 5, communal picnic table'esque. They excel in the traditional Japanese izakaya with everyone greeting you when you enter. The interior design is something I'm seeing a lot with Izakayas these days in the states--industrial, minimal, but still has that underground Japanese feel. Be warned, this is a typical Japanese bar scene---includes good food, good beer, and good vibes. It will be loud, but I consider that a good thing since everyone is/should be enjoying themselves.  The food list is pretty expansive. I forget what we ordered, but I know we ordered a lot of various dishes and pitchers of beer. The service was decent despite being a full house. It was a mixed crowd of Asians and non-Asians. Some were on dates (might be bad if you wanna talk), girls and guys nights out. overall, it was a very good experience! I highly recommend going with a group to enjoy the early part of your night of going out!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere in here is amazing! It is LOUD and full of energy. Love it!  I came here on a sunday night and did not have to wait long for a seat.  Things I got: (these are all tapas, so small dishes) -Takowasbi ( this was my favorite dish!): I did not know you were suppose to eat this with seaweed, but overall delicious.  -Salmon Belly Carpaccio: the salmon was fresh and melts in your mouth! -Teriyaki Guu Tongue: the beef tongue was very tender. -Karaage: Nothing really too special about this dish. Regular pieces of fried chicken.  -Mojito: Faint Taste.   Can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"It's okay. The food is good. But, it's too loud and not the place to go if you want to have good conversation. Also, the wait is just too long."}
{"text":"It has been a while I went to a restaurant to eat and not only was I blown away by the amazing food but the ambiance made the whole experience an amazing package. Everything I ate was carefully prepared with amazing flavor....the YakiUdon is definitely the best I ever had, the beef tongue tacos simply ravishing and the grilled mackrel cooked just the way I like it....my only complaint is that I am stuffed....there is so much more I'd like to try. A return visit is a must!"}
{"text":"I'll start by noting that I will not be nit-picking the differences between Guu Toronto and Guu Vancouver. Every Guu is suppose to be a different experience, so if you expecting a Guu Vancouver experience...well then you have already failed to understand the concept.  Parking can be found across the street in a vendor lot, but can be pricey if there is an event going on in the area. They DO NOT take reservations.   Well worth the wait, there is no other place in Toronto that is quite as eccentric and lively. The seating is extremely intimate, on picnic tablesque seating, some bar seating along the open kitchen and 4 seater tables along the side. If you are sitting near the kitchen, be prepared to smell like food afterwards.  The baked brie was the most impressive to me, but runners up would have to be the Yaki Udon, Tako Wasabi, Ikapiri, Enoki Hotate Bacon (and everything else we ate) WAS SO BOMB. Like everyone else has said, this place is loud, definately not a place to have conversations outside of \"MM THIS IS SO GOOD.\"  They also have a seasonal menu on rotation, I highly recommend ordering from this menu, as it won't be around next season.  Given it is winter right now, be prepared with a big jacket, the wait does range from 20min-1hr depending on when you go, although they do have a patio heater outside."}
{"text":"This place was cool for novelties sake. When you enter the door, the staff/cooks yell at you in Japanese. And then you are seated at a communal wooden table to order your meals. The food is not bad. It is fresh and authentic, but it really didn't blow me away. For the price, and the fact you have to wait in a line to be seated... I can't really rave about the place.  The place is also extremely loud, so you might not want to bring a date.  A friend told me after I had been there that the octopus balls are great. So you should try those if you go!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Guu but I'm not sure why people keep telling me that this location is better than the Sakabar on Bloor. It is nowhere near in comparison. It is much louder, less nice looking, don't have the sakabar seats, waiting area is outside, and the food was much less expertly prepared. We found everything tasted better at the other location."}
{"text":"The experience is unique with the welcome and good-bye greetings. However, it is really loud to have a conversation while you eat. The sake was excellent but the food was only good.  Although the food was good, I wouldn't crave it to come back."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The food is fantastic, the atmosphere is phenomenal. If you're looking for a quiet sit-down place then this is not the place to go, but otherwise, if you are adventuresome when it comes to trying different dishes, I recommend this place.   This place is good if you're going just with your partner, or if you're going with a group. You get a bit cozy with the people sitting next to you, but that's what this place is all about. I have sat both at the tables and at the bar, and while at most places I don't like sitting at the bar, at this place I don't mind because you get to see the chefs at work in the open kitchen!  This place serves huge mugs of Sapporo, but I've learned that if you're looking for better value, just get a pitcher of beer and split it amongst those at your table.   The only downside to this place is the long lineup, but maybe that's just a testament to how good it actually is! We have waited upwards of 2 hours for this place. Living so close by it's not a problem, just know that if they tell you it'll be an hour, you can probably anticipate a little longer and you should go grab a drink at a nearby pub and come back in an hour."}
{"text":"Although there are quite a few popular izakaya in the city, I actually have never been to one for the fact 1. I don't really drink, 2. not a fan of expensive small dishes especially food on a stick,  3. I know these places can get super rowdy + crowded.   Fortunately Guu offers lunch set menu that is similar to traditional Japanese restaurants. It also offers a limited selection of small dishes and the best part - super affordable! I heard that this place could get super rowdy especially after work/happy hours - but since we appeared for lunch + during the blackout of Toronto/Christmas week, the dining experience was just perfect.  It took us about 10 mins of walking up and down Church St to locate Guu (apparently building 398 is not next to or across from 399?). When we finally entered, we were greeted by everyone (even the cooks behind the counter). Loved the cozy ambiance - the long wooden tables/chairs + Christmas tree + hanging decor. We studied the menu briefly and the 5 of us decided on 2 Shoyu ramen + mini beef don sets, 1 spicy ramen, 2 sashimi sets, 1 salmon tataki, and 1 jellyfish appetizer. I wanted to try the pumpkin croquette but unfortunately wasn't offered during lunch :(.   The food came out promptly and everything was spot on. Jellyfish was refreshing, salmon tataki - with the slight amount of smokey pepper + sauce, delish!. My sashimi set was sooo fresh (loved the sweet shrimp + scallop), both ramen had amazing broth and regular portion was HUGE. We all left extremely satisfied. For 5 people (5 lunch sets + 2 appetizers) the bill came out to be about $100 with tax and tip included - not too bad especially for the quality and amount of food! Will definitely return to try some more of their small dishes and make room for their green tea cheesecake!"}
{"text":"AWESOME FOOD!!!  Expect a lineup.  I got there 10 minutes before opening on a Tuesday and was 4th in line.  There were 11 of us by the time it opened.  Loved the decor.  Food came quickly.  Bigger portions than I expected.    Being only one, I sat at the bar.  I had an icy cold breeze on me the whole time. Not good in February.  Miso soup was unlike any other I've tried...more \"tomato-y\" as it were.  But very good.  The slightly seared salmon in soy sauce with wasabe mayo and garlic chips was DEADLY GOOD!!!  So was the salmon sashimi marinated in sweet soy sauce.  The deep-fried oysters were fabulous and didn't really need any sauce (they came with a weird version of tartar sauce, which was really just mayo).  The puffed octopus balls (who knew?) were nice...but too sweet for my taste.  It's loud, yes, but the staff really seem to enjoy yelling whatever it is they're yelling!  And the chief cook was totally sexy!  I'd been to the Vancouer Guu with Garlic once before, so knew what to expect.  I loved that place, and this wasn't much different.  Wish it had been a little warmer.  Total bill without drinks was $30."}
{"text":"4.5 stars because they don't allow sake bombs  I love izakaya style food! It's the perfect place to sit around and catch up with family or friends. So I was really suprised upon walking into Guu Izakaya. The seating is a communal bar seating. You sit on a giant bench along with other patrons. I came here with my boyfriend and his local cousins. Like other reviewers say, Guu Izakaya makes  you feel as if you are in Japan.   Since I came with a large party, I got to try a little bit of everything. We ordered pitchers and pitchers of sapparo beer and hot sake but weren't allowed to do sake bombs. We ordered:  Takowasabi- wasabi marinated baby squid sashimi. Definitely 5 stars!  Amaebi- 4 pieces for $8.99?!?! What the? Am I seeing this right? In the states it cost $14 for two pieces of amaebi. It also doesn't taste nearly as good as it does from guu izakaya. The amaebi are succulent and sweet just as it should be.  5 stars!   Sashimi salad-  fresh assorted sashimi over greens and daikon covered in a mayo dressing. 3.5 stars  Chirashi don- fresh assorted sashimi over rice. 3.5 stars  Hotate Carpaccio- scallop carpaccio. 4 stars  Gyu Carpaccio- beef carpaccio. It was so good we ordered seconds.  5 stars!  Salmon Carpaccio- 4 stars  Salmon Natto Yukke- salmon and tuna carpaccio, avocado, and green onions mixed with egg yolks. Omg so so unique and delicious. It's made right at the table to ensure freshness. I crave for this in the states. 5 stars!  Takoyaki- who doesn't love a good grilled octopus ball? It was so delicious! I haven't had takoyaki as good as I've tried here. 5 stars!  Ebi Mayo- the mayo was just too much for me. 3 stars.  Brie Cheese- fried Brie cheese. I've never ever heard of fried Brie! Especially from a Japanese restaurant?!?! I had to try it! Omg! It was so good. My heart was skipping a beat, literally. It comes with a mango jelly. If you love cheese! This is a must order. 5 stars!  Kakimayo- mayo stuffed oysters. This was another one of my favorites. It's absolutely flavorful and savory. 5 stars!   Green tea cheesecake- I've never had green tea cheesecake before. It was love at first taste! The crust was light and the green tea cheesecake was super fluffy and light. So so so amazing! I crave for this in my sleep. 5 stars!   Almond tofu- if you like almond jello, you'll like almond tofu. I really enjoyed this refreshing dessert.  Banana tempura- deep fried banana with ice cream. It was good but the green tea cheesecake and almond tofu stole my heart.    I highly recommend locals, out of towners, or anyone open to try something new to come to Guu Izakaya! My favorite dishes here are the: amaebi, takowasabi, gyu carpaccio, salmon natto yukke, takoyaki, Brie cheese, and kaki mayo! They're so good you'll order seconds. Also don't forget to finish off dinner with green tea cheesecake or almond tofu. The servers here are very friendly and helpful. They are also very attentive at getting things done. Other patrons are really friendly and are having a great time themselves. Therefore the overall ambiance of this place is welcoming and outgoing."}
{"text":"This is a fun hip place to be- it can be a bit noisy with all the yelling they do as they greet you into their restuarant. This was the best small plate Asian Fusion place I have been too. We ordered their seafood salad, fried tofu, bibimbap , fried okra, short ribs and topped it off with their almond tofu and green tea cheese cake. Everything was delicious but I especially enjoyed their almond tofu!"}
{"text":"This place is extremely loud.  Don't come here for a quiet talk because you will be drowned out by the music and waiters yelling.   It feels like I am walking into a nightclub because it is just so loud.   Luckily, we got the tables outside.   We went there during the Mega-Karaage night so it was cheap chicken thighs.   It takes them a while to make and fry the chicken thighs.  Once they arrived, it was arranged on top of each other.  The chicken was alright.  Not that moist.  The skin was crispy.   I ended up eating 3 of them and I was full.  I think I ended up spending about $10-$15 for it.  I think they really need to turn down the loud music.   If I were to sit inside, I'd go deaf."}
{"text":"Highly recommend making a reservation for Kinka! It's incredible Japanese food, the flavors were Umani Central.  We ordered a few things to try from the menu, the standout dishes were the Karaage and the Seared Tuna. Runner up is the Yakiudon. I suggest you go with 3 - 4 people, so you can order a few items to try. They do offer \"lunch sets\", which are a great variety, but if you want to try more than .a few items, fo with friends.  The staff is super nice and the even though we came at the end of lunch, you can feel that it's a very lively place.  Pro Tip: be careful when eating the takoyaki balls, they will burn your mouth if you don't let them cool down. seriously super hot!! They were great but I did burn the roof of my mouth."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! The atmosphere was very lively. Beef sashimi is a must eat at Guu!"}
{"text":"So much fun!  It's like a party every night!  Cool open concept dining area, amazing tapas style Japanese food, and great beer selection!  Have gone for birthdays and work events, really good for big groups!"}
{"text":"Very good food. This place is very loud, crowded, and rowdy. It definitely has some personality to it. The entire staff greets you when you walk in and leave. I made the terrible mistake of bringing my grandparents here but that's irrelevant for this review.  The food: BOMB. Like wow it was so good. My favorite had to be the mushroom bibambop. Mmmmmmmm sooooooo goooooood. But honestly, everything I had was divine so there's no need to target a single dish or two. This is not one of those places with a signature dish. Just get whatever you're feeling at the time. And DONT pass up dessert. The matcha cheesecake is the perfect way to top off a splendid meal.   The atmosphere: THE ENERGY IS REAL. IT WAS LIT. Tip: don't bring the young children or elderly.   Service: average? They were attentive but didn't do anything outstanding.  Great food, I would definitely come back... But with friends not family"}
{"text":"Really great place, small and cousy, a bit noisy. Food is awsome, so many flavors to discover. Chilled japanese beer (Saporo) is amazing. Just an awsome experience."}
{"text":"I like this place.  Fun concept, energetic and friendly workers, great food but expensive.  I wish the place would expand though.  But great overall and really fun dining experience."}
{"text":"This place used to be called \"Guu\". When people consider \"Japanese food\" to be the same thing as sushi, is like calling Chinese food dumplings. This place serves authentic Japanese food, not sushi. The loud environment reminds me a lot like these izakayas in Japan, and they whole environment is fantastic. DO NOT recommend if you are taking a girl on your romantic first date because you'll need to use your outdoor voice to speak to each other. The food is slightly high since the portions are very small, but in my opinion it is worth the money. Love the food, it's unique, authentic, and delicious. Cannot get enough!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place for my birthday this year with a friend. It's one of those lovely places where they yell at you with cheer when you walk in and when you leave.  They play hip hop and rap mostly (which I love). Really cool design with lots of wood.  Services is great. They really know the menu, are super friendly and very fast.  We tried allllll the things. We went with a lot of suggestions from our server.  I would r suggest the plum wine. Tasted a bit like cough syrup but I think it's just an squired taste.  The food was out of this world.  We got the sashimi salad, salmon tataki (so good we ordered another round), gyu carpaccio, the spicy tuna, gyoza, Octopus balls, kakimayo oysters (we ordered a second round of those too. Kind of like oysters Rockefeller), kinoko bibmbap.  Would go back for sure!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  AMBIANCE Really cute, like a Japanese beer hall with lots of communal long tables surrounded by the kitchen and bar. There are small tables as well with really uncomfortable, super tiny stools. The atmosphere is festive with the staff welcoming and thanking every patron who walks in and out of the door. As a result, the inside is extremely loud and the noise can start to become grating. HINT: Ask for a table outside if the weather is nice. It's much more pleasant and quiet.  FOOD It's an izakaya, so tapas-style items. Order many and share. They have a really tempting party set menu that features many of the top dishes and is $25 or $35pp, depending on which menu you want. This makes ordering so easy, but unfortunately, it's for a minimum party of 4.  For two, we ended up getting: ++ Gyu carpaccio ($7.50)- seared beef sashimi with ponzu, wasabi mayo, and garlic chips. The beef was cut extra thin and was very flavorful with all of the toppings. - Tuna tartare ($8.30)- sesame oil marinated tuna with teriyaki sauce and mango sauce. The tuna was extremely soft and not in the good melt-in-your-mouth way, so it was either not that fresh or just really tenderized from the marinade. The mango sauce was too sweet and didn't seem appropriate for this dish. + Karaage ($8.30)- five large pieces of deep fried chicken with garlic mayo. Crispy and satisfying, but not the best. ++ Kinoko bibimbap ($9.50)- rice, mushrooms, and cheese with seaweed in a stone bowl. This did not appeal to me as much as the more traditional Buta kimchi bibimbap with pork, but Kinoko is the one Yelpers rave about so we decided to try it. Surprisingly, it was unique and tasted really good. Tender button mushrooms with tons of seaweed mixed in the rice made for a savory clean dish. Didn't notice the cheese at all. Try not to mix your rice and let it crisp up for a tasty textural change. ++ Kakimayo ($8.80)- two baked oysters with mushrooms, spinach, garlic mayo, and cheese. These oysters are huge and extremely saucy/cheesy. Really heavy and reminded me of something you would get at a family chain restaurant, and I mean that in the best way possible. + Almond tofu ($4.50)- almond extract flavored tofu pudding. Extremely soft and tasty, but not very different from the make-it-yourself $1 almond pudding you get at the Asian market. Portion is really small."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the loudness and the greetings and whatnot, but I love this place to death. Always good food and drinks and always leave feeling happy. A go-to for whatever the occasion."}
{"text":"Do you like delicious Japanese pub food? Do you also like LOTS AND LOTS OF YELLING ALL THE TIME???!!! Then you'll love Kinka Izakaya. Fun vibe but it's hard to hold a conversation. Can't hear your date? Just smile and nod as you pop a tasty takoyaki ball in your mouth and wash it down with some sake."}
{"text":"New name, same restaurant. If you can't tolerate loud noise, don't come here. If you want \"proper proportion\", don't come here.  If you want good food and feel like going to Japanese version of Cheers, this is the place for you.  Again, \"Izakaya\" is like a pub, and food portion are small as they meant to compliment the Japanese wine/sake. This is not a \"Japanese Restaurant\". Anyway, while their \"main point\" is their wide selection of sake, I honestly can't find fault with any of their food as they are expertly done. Our favourites are: sashimi salad, tatami, and Unagi Doria. We order these every time. Oh, their noise? They just want to make sure you feel like you've just entered your friend's house. You know, like Cheers."}
{"text":"I've been to at least one of the Guus in Vancouver, so I guess I knew what to expect: a loud, chaotic atmosphere, and small dishes that arrive in random order at random times. If you're okay with that, and enjoy tasty izakaya-type food at moderate prices, then Guu is for you. And since I'm okay with that, I love Guu, and I was ecstatic that they opened a Toronto branch.  Tonight, my companion and I shared a few dishes from various parts of the menu. The takowasabi, diced octopus with wasabi sauce, was a perfect nose-cleansing opener, and one I would definitely order again. We had the ikamaru, grilled squid with garlic mayo, a simple dish cooked nicely and deliciously tasty. We ordered maguro tataki, the seared albacore tuna with garlic chips, and gyu carpaccio, seared marbled beef, and they were perhaps too similar. Either one is a fine choice on its own though. Of the two, we thought the the tuna was superior and fresh. Finally, the gindara grilled black cod had a delectably sweet sauce, and the texture of the fish was melt-in-your-mouth. At $9.80, it's the most expensive dish on the menu, but well worth it.  I concluded with the cheesecake of the day, which today was Japanese yuzu citrus flavour. I've had better cheesecake, but it was certainly a satisfactory slice, if a bit small, and the citrus flavour was refreshing. (At only $4 a slice, you could have two.)  Guu isn't a place to have a quiet, romantic date, but it's a great place if you want to smile and feel happy -- the chefs and servers' enthusiasm is infectious. The popularity of this place means you'll be waiting outside for a table, so don't come here with a big group, but for 2-4 people, it's worth the wait. Yum."}
{"text":"Came here based on Yelp reviews - and was not disappointed.  I almost missed the place.  A very innocent looking building - I honestly thought the place shut down, or was in a warehouse or something.  No cars around.  I almost gave up.  Noticed a piece of paper that pointed to the entrance.  As I neared the door, I heard some noise from inside.  I thought, ok, should be open.  Then I opened the door.  BLAST!  A blast of noise excitement, the place was packed, and everyone was waving and welcoming me in.  Whoa!  Here, the workers will, in Japanese; loudly welcome customers coming in, loudly say goodbye to customers leaving, loudly announce the arrival of freshly made food to the server pick up location, loudly announce random things.  I was seated at the sushi bar.  The server was very pleasant, and helped me choose things to order.  I ordered some excellent fresh sashimi, and also got some delicious oysters.  Overall,  the menu is an amazing selection of food - It was hard to choose from so many excellent options.  This place is VERY loud and ALIVE.  It is all positive vibes.  This is NOT a place to go for quiet dinner.  I highly recommend for the food selection, the excellent service, and the experience."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE the atmosphere!!!! From their greeting, to the food, to the happy birthdays...its always a lively and fun place to have food with friends. I've been to other Izakayas but they will never compare to Guu.   The only negative is that there is always a line, so be prepared to wait. They allow you to put down your phone number, so that's always a plus since you can explore shops on Church or on Yonge Street to pass time.  My favorite thing to order here are the Ebi shrimp with mayo - always crispy and drizzled with the right amount of mayo. The drinks are always a great choice as well. Instead of sitting at a table, my friend and I sat right in front of the kitchen. Our food was prepared extremely fast and the service was spectacular. Our water was always full and servers were readily available if we needed anything else.    Always a great experience!!!"}
{"text":"Nice. Great ambiance. So interactive. The salmon tataki is nice and so is the smoked sushi. The beef salad is nice too. The small eats are nice and the pitcher option of Asahi is  a great accompaniment. The sake is also good."}
{"text":"Oh this place is joy ... all the food is great and the servers are awesome... had a few sake bombs and they sang a sake bomb song which was so cool... great atmosphere"}
{"text":"What a delightful place. I was really looking forward to going to this place. It reminds me of the fun izakaya style restaurants I would go to in the East Village in New York City. I was not disappointed.  We were lucky enough to not have to wait in line, I know sometimes the line could be pouring out the door. It's a Japanese tapas restaurant, so make sure you go with a few friends.   Don't go to an izakaya if you don't want to be in a fun, boisterous environment, and have a good time. You sit at these communal long tables on these small stools and really take part in the community. The servers are fun, and in traditional style, call out welcomes and orders etc. throughout the restaurant.  We ordered a ton of food (we were a party of 6), but here are some stand outs:  - Okonomiyaki - Reminds me of the stands you get this tasty treat from on the side of the street. The flavors are just right.  - Takowasabi - Marinated octopus. The octopus is raw, but works well with the acid and the heat from the sauce.  - Amaebi - Sweet shrimp. I love this delicious shrimp. It's raw, but the flesh is sweet and really does not need any dipping sauce.  - Kakimayo - Deliciously baked oysters with cheese and mayo.   Bring friends and don't forget the sake!"}
{"text":"The chirashi don is so flavorful, will be perfect if with sea urchin."}
{"text":"Had a birthday dinner here, the atmosphere was PERFECT!! It' so full of energy that you can't help but feel the \"high\" as well.  The portion sizes were small. We had a group of 12 so we just ordered a bunch of dishes to share. Some had to be ordered twice since it was not enough to go around the table. But everything was tasty. They sang \"Happy Birthday\" to you in the end and let you wear a \"special hat\" XD, not sure if it's complimentary of the Birthday Desserts we ordered. Would recommend for a group night out or if you want to spice up your sushi dining experience."}
{"text":"I give this place a 5/5! Wow what can I say. I came here with a special someone and she was on point with her taste in food (not surprised since she's a foodie too). But just to start it of we tried 5 dishes here. By far the dishes are pretty good portion if you are the type of person that likes to try a variety of things. They aren't too big, but aren't too small too depending on what you get. The atmosphere is something like you've never experienced before. It's a little overwhelming at first, but it's like a night club in there. High energy and different. That's all I can say.  My favorite here was the salmon natto and the jellyfish starter. I've tried my fair share in natto and this place has such a unique twist in mixing their natto. It's def. something to try for if you are into it (for people who haven't tried, I suggest you choose wisely. Natto isn't something that a lot of people like of the bat). But the jellyfish was def. to die for! I'm chinese and we eat our fair share of jelly fish. This kind however was very smooth and silky, whereas chinese jelly fish is prepared more gritty/ texture based. Usually the jellyfish that are prepared by the Chinese are more rigid in shape as well.  Another great dish to try is the cod (Or at least I think it's the cod. It's one of the cooked fish ones since there aren't many cooked fish).. That one is THE BOMB. Seriously just try it. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Great vibes, great food, great people.  If you're a fan of Saki, you must try there bamboo saki. Also there fried Brie cheese balls are to die for.  Another perk here are the washrooms, always loaded with mouthwash and toothpicks. The only draw back here are the prices are a tiny bit on the high side."}
{"text":"Food and service are very good but that not what earns this place 5 stars. This place gets huge points for unique experience."}
{"text":"Excellent Japanese food. Highly recommended. We got seated fast with no reservations. The service was good as well."}
{"text":"One word. LOUD. So loud I could hardly taste the food--my stomach was busy tensing up from the noise. I'm talking 92 dB here, measured, thank you very much.. Jet plane noise.  The sashimi (hamachi) was shruggable. The BBQ pork was FATTY. So fatty, less than half of each slice was edible. It didn't help that the couple next to us seemed to get twice the number of nice-looking, lean slices. The grilled black cod was fine: well-cooked, but not as tasteful as you would expect. The Butakimchi Bibimbap was bland. really bland.  The service was friendly, if a little ADD, but it's what deserves that second star. I could have skipped the reminder from the hostess seating us that they have a two-hour limit on seating. In my book that's plain rude. We arrived at 5:45 and got seated immediately. Waiting out in the cold for an hour, the SOP for arriving any later, makes absolutely no sense for this place and would have probably held this review at one star.  So, I ask, what exactly is all the fuss about here? Yes, the place is energetic. But the ambiance is not cool enough to make it a clubby destination (the thumping of the music is just wishful thinking on the part of the owners), and the food is not good enough to make it a gourmet destination like Nami.  What we have here, folks, is a Japanese Fuzion. Except you don't even get your own table. And did I mention... LOUD!!!!"}
{"text":"One word to describe my experience: wow  It was my first time at Guu, and I had a very pleasant experience. As soon as we entered the doors, we were given a loud welcome (in Japanese) by the chefs and servers. We were seated beside each other, right in front of the cooks. Our server was very helpful and offered some suggestions for our first time.   We tried 5 dishes and they were all delicious. My personal favourites were the pork belly (seared, with spicy garlic sauce), and kakimayo (baked oysters with mushrooms, spinach, garlic mayo, and tiny slices of cheddar cheese). Also ordered were takoyaki (deep fried octopus balls with tonkatsu sauce and karashi mayo), karubi (grilled salt & pepper beef short ribs with scallion sauce), and my friend's personal favourite, gindara (grilled black cod with saikyo miso & white wine sauce).    One thing that should be noted is that the atmosphere is very loud (from all the welcomes and goodbyes). This may be a deal breaker for some, but I liked this vibe.  I had a great time. The food was amazing and the great service was like a cherry on top. Just like on our entrance, we were sent out with a handshake and loud saynoaras from the host.    Ordered: Takoyaki:  $5 for ~4 pieces Karubi: $7 for ~6-8 pieces Gindara:  $12 for 1 piece Kakimayo: $7.80 for 2 large oysters Pork belly: $7.50 for ~4-6 pieces"}
{"text":"After 11hrs of terrible weather and driving to Toronto from Albany the wifey and I ended up in here. I have to say I was just as excited to be here as last time. However this time I was there for my Burffday and I was ready to relax and have some fun with my partner in crime.   So let's get started...Walking in here is a a warm screaming welcome so that's always fun. I was here on a Thursday and it was sake bomb night. If you end up at this place, you have to try at least once. Now I have had sake bombs at a lot of places and I'm sure so have you. But this place it's an experience you must try. It gets loud and every server gets into it and lets just say the birdffday was on its way.   Food was just as I remembered it..Deeelicious for th most part. We had the tuna sashimi, the salmon sashimi, beef carpaccio to start and they were all delicious. Carpaccio was Bomb so def try that. We also got the yellowfin sashimi and wel let's just say same as above, fresh and yummy. We then got the pork belly bao buns and to be fair I am a huge bao bun snob but the pork belly was cooked perfectly and they were excellent. We also got scallop sashimi, the spare ribs and well lots of SAKE...smooth and yummy.   The only thing we didn't like was the pork dish, it seemed a bit under seasoned and happened to be cold so we had to send it back.    Lastly we got the matcha cheesecake with matcha ice cream and that was mind blowing. It was a perfect cap to the meal and birthday."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere! The waiters are fun and high spirited. Stumbled upon this gem visiting Toronto for the first time and brought my best friend for his bday a couple months later."}
{"text":"My first guu experience was in Vancouver and after moving out here I was excited to try this location. You cannot go wrong with anything you order, try the baked oysters, one of my favorites! Expect a wait! Sitting outside is nice, but inside you get more of the Guu experience!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family during our visit to Toronto, and we all agreed that this was the best meal we had there!  First of all, the staff there are really fun and super friendly. Since we were there for an early dinner, we were able to get a table outside, away from the craziness of the indoor dining room.   Between the four of us, we ordered 7 or 8 dishes, and it was definitely enough to fill us! Everything we ate was excellent, however some standouts included the salmon natto yukke, kinoko bibimbap, and this hamachi/shrimp dish (I'm not sure if this is still on the menu? I had this meal over a year ago!). I'm looking back at my pictures of the salmon natto yukke and I am literally salivating - it was definitely one of the most memorable dishes of my stay in Toronto! I also remember being unsure about the whole rice/cheese/mushroom combo in the kinoko bibimbap, and almost discouraged my family from ordering it, but I have never been so happy to be so wrong. Such a great and comforting dish!  I really wish Guu would come to the States! I have tried several izakayas in NYC and while all were pretty good, nothing in my mind has been able to top Guu Izakaya."}
{"text":"A bit pricey and loud but the staff are really friendly and the food is great. I recommend the carbonara udon"}
{"text":"About a 3.5. I still feel the place is a bit overrated. They're really lucky there's so many loyal fans... it was good but it wasn't to-die-for.  Guu doesn't take reservations nor allows u to wait inside. We needed a table for 5 & in the end had to wait 1.5 hrs at a nearby bar. What a waste of time. I was hungry... and you know the portions aren't always generous though very authentic and yummy (some). It would be hard to find anything else like this in Toronto I think. Our group ordered a ton of dishes. My favourite was prob the fried brie cheese! I took lots of pics but it seems there are a crapload of pics on yelp already :) But I did take pics while outside... in the rain... waiting...  I would definitely come back again though not during busy hours & esp not on weekends. I just don't feel the wait is worth my time. I want food now not hrs later."}
{"text":"My partner liked this place more than I did, so maybe it's just me.   First, wow, this place is LOUD. I understand that the shouting is part of the Izakaya experience, but the space is cavernous with lots of stone and metal, so it was loud even when the staff weren't screaming. It's just ... a lot. I might have liked this place better in my younger years, but it's just too much for me now.  Second, we had the set menu, which was just okay. The Gyu Shabu salad (beef on greens) was fantastic. The Salmon was also good. The chicken was fine, the oysters were okay, and the fish was fine. The short ribs were overcooked and VERY salty. And the bibimbap was legitimately terrible -- we only ate a few bites of over salted rice (way too much oyster sauce) and we were done.   Apparently this place is \"fun,\" but I didn't get it. I'd pass, if I were you."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come with a group of friends to have a good time. The atmosphere is lively but it can get really loud. I've been here few times but I haven't had any dish that is unforgettable or super tasty except for maybe the karaage? Anything deep fried tastes good with a pint anyways.   Service is great, the staff is always polite and attentive. Be sure to order some sake bombs and food will taste great eventually."}
{"text":"Food, ambience, sake selection and price are great here but the shouting and exaggerated friendliness is off-putting.    Suitable occasion is five guys after work to celebrate project success or new account.  Not for first date or Mother's Day."}
{"text":"Where shall I begin... I was only going to be in Toronto for 3 days and this was the first restaurant I wanted to try because of it's awesome reviews.  Right when you open the door, everyone SCREAMS welcoming Japanese greetings. Sadly, my boyfriend and I had to wait 40 minutes on a Friday night for 2 bar seats... but the tasty food and friendly service definitely made up for it!  Everything is tapas style, so we ordered 6 plates, 1 dessert, and the Japanese soda (which is really sweet but very addicting). My favorite dishes were the BLACK COD ($11) which is a small piece, but so succulent and tender that it melts in your mouth and the SEARED SALMON ($6) which had delicious toasted garlic flakes. My boyfriend liked the FRIED OCTOPUS BALLS, but I found them way too creamy/overwhelming. We also ordered the amberjack sashimi (better than yellowtail IMO), gyu carpaccio (the sauce was too sweet for my taste), and bacon scallops (nothing out of the ordinary and my least favorite dish). The BLACK SESAME ICE CREAM looks very unusual, but after the first few bites, I couldn't stop eating it... it was sweet yet salty and a delicious ending to our meal!  I suggest not coming here if you're very very hungry or else you'll need ~6 plates to get full by yourself!  They also scream good-byes when you leave... the upbeat atmosphere definitely leaves you with a happy mood. I can't wait to come back on my next visit to Canada!"}
{"text":"We had a great time.  Enjoyed the range of Asian dishes and shared 5.  Short rib and cold salmon were my favs, but all were tasty and interesting.  When they say Sapporo comes in a \"big\" mug they mean it.  Although we loved it, it's not for everyone.  Very loud and hectic atmosphere.  However if you want a fantastic Hipster meets Asian fusion experience that feels like you are in a Japanese game show, Go for it!"}
{"text":"Great place. Neat but loud atmosphere. The staff are friendly and loudly greet you! The food was delicious. I think the quantity of items could be increased a little for the cost but it was delicious. The tuna was fresh and everything came out HOT and was not sitting waiting to brought to the table. Staff were great, checking regularly on how the food was and were speedy. The experience is more than just the food. It's an overall great experience."}
{"text":"After taking the recommendation of a Tornoto Yelper (Joie T.), I will again fully and wholeheartedly support the legitimacy of Yelp reviews. And the fact that Yelpers are always willing and ready to recommend their favorite places to a perfect stranger.   Coming to Guu Izakaya means you're going to a party. A word to the wise: do yourself a favor and don't ever go here in a bad mood. If you're in a lover's quarrel, solve it before you walk in and get ambushed with a thousand \"IRRASHAIMASE's!!!!\" If you come in a foul mood, you'll just look like a fool with a Scrooge soul--the energy in the restaurant is extremely contagious and it seems like this may be the only place in Toronto worth having a birthday party. The cooks don Kanye shades, a server puts a whale hat on his head and a big whiteboard bearing the recipients name gets marched out with the entire crew. The staff is a young, well-oiled machine with impeccable communication even beyond the deafening noise. It's amazing.  After you come down from the high of eating at Guu (which has taken me at least two weeks apparently) you realize what the wonderfully smart food gimmick actually is: fast-food Asian easily replicated and laced with the addictive elements of cheese, deep-fried batter and mounds of creamy sauces one step away from mayo. But at 5-8 bucks a plate, you can't complain. No, all you do is order more.   My top picks: the fried kabocha pumpkin with a boiled egg inside and of course, the cheese bi bim bap. Yeah, a bit much. But you won't be sorry you did it.   Kanpai!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Love the atmosphere! So warm and welcoming and the food are very good.  It's just a bit too expensive for the portion that they serve.   Will come back for sure we all my friends."}
{"text":"As a U.S. visitor I didn't expect much from our northern neighbor in terms of Asian cuisine - usually NYC or LA covers that well.  Kinka Izakaya is a treat for any person, and puts itself squarely on the culinary map.  The service, food, and decor are superb from the moment you step through the door.  Save yourself the hassle of browsing their huge menu and get the tasting course - a reasonable priced medley of all their best options that is perfect for sharing.    Almost each course was good, but what stood out were the subtly delicious steamed spinach, the juicy umami goodness of karaage, and the tart tenderness of the salmon tataki.  In other words, it does the basics really well, without complicated overpowering flavors.  Of course the grilled cod and pork cheeks were good, but after a while it can get a bit overwhelming.  As if your senses weren't taking in enough already, sit by the bar to get the full experience - watching the open kitchen prepare items with passionate efficiency, hearing the workers greeting guests, smelling the crackling oil - just refrain from reaching over and feeding yourself."}
{"text":"The coolest dining experience I have had in years! You have to try this place. Come prepared to have fun and to experience the most amazing food you have ever had. If you have had tempura shrimp before, think again, the GUU version is unbelievable.  If you like a loud, crazy atmosphere with fresh, original food try GUU! If you want a quiet, romantic dinner this is not the place for you.  I will definitely be back as often as I can."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Izakayas! Food is always great here, and the environment is always so lively! Hard to carry an intimate conversation due to the noise but if you're on a date with awkward silences, I'm sure the noise will fill those silences for you.  Some of my favourites include the the unagi rice (cooked perfectly!), blowtorch mackerel (MMMMM), and  deep fried cheese with mango sauce (it comes in 4, so you definitely want to share this with someone who likes cheese. I had to eat all 3 pieces myself due to my other party being sensitive to lactose. But hey, not complaining.. So gooood, and soooo cheesy!)"}
{"text":"I never thought it would be possible to fall head over heels for a restaurant but it's happening. I never called an experience at a restaurant my dream restaurant but I have now--I am in loooove with this place!  Walking in is like walking in a surprise party. The staff drops everything they're doing to greet you. I was hoping to come here for some of their grilled food, particularly the grilled oysters with cheese which I couldn't sit back and drool anymore. Well, it's unfortunate that I came during lunch time because it's only offered during dinner. I had the Hamburg teishoku, which to my surprise, was a bento set for only $12.50! Even though I'm usually not a fan of meatloaf (thank you, frozen dinners), the sauce made me want to love it. The stew was sweet and sour; it tasted a whole lot like tomatoes! It tastes really good with a bowl of rice. The miso soup was great and fresh and so was the side salad.   The almond tofu was out of this world. Oh my god, I don't even know where to begin but it was so delicate and just so delicious. A nice, and smooth almond flavoring but the portion was small and it was gone just like that. I recommend anyone who comes here, to get as much bowls of this as they can possibly stuff because the whole thing is too damn luscious to pass on.  I loved, loved my waiter--he was so patient, attentive and kind. There was another guy in a kimono that brought our food to us and he was really kind too. We sat on the outside balcony--next to tree and it was so peaceful and nice. The inside is full of nice benches like a beer garden. We left with a loud goodbye too--my family doesn't even treat me this nice! I will definitely come back the next time I'm in Toronto and will be here for breakfast, lunch and dinner, too!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! Went here with a bunch of my friends from culinary school. Restaurant was filled with positive vibes. The kitchen staff, the servers all yelled with great joy in Japanese, which filled the room with good energy! After that, we ordered our drinks and they arrived quickly. Even though it was busy, our food arrived shortly and was absolutely delicious. Not only the flavours were great, the presentation of each dish was absolutely stunning. The kitchen staff here really care about each dish and it tastes as if they've poured their hearts into each plate!   5/5 would recommend if you want great izakaya food!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  As you as you enter the restaurant you get a loud welcome greeting form the staff as if you entered a surprise party and you are the guest of honour!  The food is amazing and the service is great.  One my of favorite dishes is the Bibi bap and their sashimi dishes.  I do recommend making a reservation on a Friday or Saturday night so you don't get disappointing."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: only went here for drinks. But honestly, who doesn't love a place where they say hello and goodbye to everyone that comes and goes from this place. We sat near where they were preparing the food and everything looked and smelled fantastic. Will try the food the next time we are in Toronto"}
{"text":"Upscale . Good for drinks and appetizers. More authentic menu , i couldn't understand all of them too. Should definitely try."}
{"text":"I'm sad today to say that this was my worst experience out of the three times that I've been here.  The shrimp poutin and the oysters were excellent but that was about it.  The sashimi salad had small pieces of fish in it n a lot of lettuce.  The miso soup was on the salty side.  The octopus with soy sauce was okay.  The chicken knees were a little bit greasy n bland.  They forgot my fried ck and didn't sing happy bday for my gf :(.  I had to asked 3 different people before n got my water.  The reason why I'm giving this place a 3 stars is because of the other two time that I was there."}
{"text":"After months of hearing raves about this place, decided to check this place out. I made reservation and we got placed at reserved seats by the front door....what a mistake. Waitresses, waiters, hostesses, cooks all screaming everytime someone comes in and out, any other time somebody moves, has a birthday, and so forth. I am fine with a loud environment but when it's bothering you from having a normal conversation with your companion, it's too much.   As for the food, not bad but overly hyped. I had the Sexy Queen cocktail (guava, sake) and my friend had the Lychee Mojito.  I'm not that into drinks but both were watered down. Mine tasted like juice. We both commented \"Where's the alcohol!\"  I had the BC tuna sashimi and the teriyaki tongue. The sashimi was done fine and tasted alright with the radish salad and scallions but needed a sprinkle of salt and heat. Not enough flavours for me for a delicate dish. The tongue was rubbery. That's right, rubbery. Meaning it was overcooked. I've had good beef tongue and I was expecting better from Guu. Luckily I had marinated bean sprout salad and again, scallions to eat the rubbery meat with so it was edible. Maybe I should've said something but one, the place was too loud, and two, I was spending pretty much all my time trying to talk with my friend. On the other hand, my friend (not used to too much Japanese food) enjoyed her food. She had the deep fried calamari and fried karaage. I have to admit, both were fried and seasoned well. However, any old place can do good fried food. The batter on the fried karaage was pretty special, I'd have to say. Almost tasted double deep fried but didn't have that usual oily and heavy taste. And also crunchy but also crumbly at the same time. The karaage definitely saved this restaurant for me IMO and saved this review 1 star. We also ordered the Asahi Black. With the karaage and beer, best combination of the night.   I wouldn't mind coming back here to try the carb -heavy dishes like the udon or the rice but for the other tapas - sized dishes....nah. I'd rather spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's my first time there. The staff is nice. They are very cheerful. I cannot say the atmosphere disagrees me but it indeed surprised us.  We tried short ribs, octopus ball, miso soup and deep fried cheese. tasting shots of sake, 11 dollar of three shots of your choice.  I'd say the octopus ball is deep fried which is not the traditional way to do it. I prefer the slow pan fried way. Cheese was too heavy for me, especially after the meat and deep fried dish. I think it is worth trying.  Short ribs was nice. The grill flavour is very unique here- comment from my husband. Miso soup is a must try in Japanese restaurant. Here it is outstanding."}
{"text":"I brought a girlfriend here for a change of scenery.  We had a few dishes and drinks for dinner based on the great reviews on yelp and I had been to Guu once before a year or two back.  It was a miss this time around unfortunately, and it could be due to our choices in dishes.  I felt that the dishes were too greasy for our liking and the meal didn't feel balanced.  Overall, it was still a good night, hence the 4 stars.  I ordered their grapefruit cocktail, which is delicious - I remember I tried it on my first visit.   The place is very busy and noisy, that's the point I understand.  We sat in a corner table and felt it difficult to have a conversation.  We then quickly left to a pub close by to continue our evening.    The service is good.  They are very attentive and want to ensure you are having a good time and if you want to order more.  I would recommend this place if you want to try something different and also have a palate for Asian cuisine"}
{"text":"To start off, the atmosphere is amazing! From the moment you walk in, to the moment you walk out, there is always something going on. When you enter, all the people who work there all yell in Japanese and greet you! I would recommend making reservations as it does get quite packed quickly. The only issue I had with this place was the \"coat rack system\" they had. I personally don't like leaving my stuff unintended and I didn't feel completely comfortable leaving my jacket at the coat rack at the front of the restaurant. But that's just me haha.   Time for the good stuff! The food was absolutely amazing! The only thing you wish for is to have more on the plate! My friend and I ordered deep fried brie cheese, karaage, ikapiri, and yakiudon. If you're a cheese lover like me, the deep fried brie cheese is a must! That was my personal favourite dish. Unfortunately we didn't try any of their drinks, but I did see people drinking sake out of a bamboo, which looked awesome!   The service was amazing, all the workers are super nice and friendly! Overall, I would totally recommend going here with a group of friends and sharing a bunch of different items on their menu."}
{"text":"My friends surprised me for my birthday and it was probably the best birthday I've ever had.  It's a very busy place, we were super late but they held down the spot for us.   The place its self is a whole experience on it's own. Like everyone mentioned every time someone entered or left ALL the staff, the waiters/waitresses and even the kitchen staff would greet or say goodbye to us. They even sang Happy Birthday and gift a picture with the dining group, waiter and staff!   The food was a bit pricey but worth it. They have a very unique menu and the presentation of the food was very well thought out and pretty.  I would HIGHLY recommend going there for the experience and their delicious food!"}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious with my girls, and was disappointed for the most part until the amazing manager (Japanese girl who's name starts with a N) made up to us. Most servers did not get the basis of customer service, being the restaurant and the menu was not cheap, we expected way better service to our table. Ice cream brought to us melted and instead of providing 4 person serving for the sashimi, we got 2. Food was average and it is not somewhere you go if you want to catch up, simply far too loud and cramped. Would be returning but for a quick bite instead."}
{"text":"I did not expect this place to be as good as it is. Didn't make a reservation, but got a table immediately. The place is loud, fun, and energetic. The food is very good and price is affordable.If I lived in Toronto, I would go all the time."}
{"text":"This place is a blast. Been going for years, and they keep a long list of good standard menu items, as well as a 2-3 page daily special menu. go early. have fun. portions are small and sharable, so try different things and order lots!"}
{"text":"I absolute love kinka izakaya! Wonderful food and excellent service (and ofc energy). I've been to the kinka in Montreal, but prefer this location much more. It's a tight cozy space. There are long tables with benches and small tables with stools. Great spot for birthday dinners if you like the attention."}
{"text":"The food is very good but it's really slooooooooooooow... Lovely place to hang out with friends, a little bit too noisy though."}
{"text":"They have mouthwash in their bathrooms! That's a testament to how much thought has gone into making this place guu-uuuuuuuud!  I thankfully didn't have to wait for a table because we went on a Sunday afternoon, but had we gone even an hour later we would have had to wait. The line-ups are deserved: the sapporo is free flowing and the tapas is interesting and cooked well for the most part. We ordered a bunch of stuff, including: pork cheeks, squid, fried brie (which was delicious), a sea weed/raphini salad (which was a bit too fishy tasting) and were satiated!   It's a pretty boisterous place, as an izakaya should be: welcoming staff, loud music, and the chatter of content patrons. It's a great place for a night out. Guu is guud."}
{"text":"I really really really liked this place. From the greeting upon entering to the frozen grapes and the good byes. I have nothing but praises for kinka.   The food was amazing. The must haves: the oysters and the beef! Yummy!!  Just make sure you make reservations! And don't be shy, sitting at the bar you get the cooks do their thing! It's pretty exciting too!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome here. Definitely one of the best izakayas I've tried in Toronto. (My favourite is still Katsuya Hollywood)   The portions are small but very, very tasty. My favourites are the pork cheek, fried calamari and grilled mackerel.    The only downside is the waiting time. The line ups on church are insanely long, up to 2 hours sometimes but the one on Bloor is slightly better with no wait times sometimes."}
{"text":"It's super loud here but I always super super love the food. The experience is really fun, they vary things up a bit which is nice, and my only real complaint is that you really shouldn't come here if you want to talk with other people in your party. You'll never hear a word! Oh, and also, for birthdays, they don't really offer anything special, you kind of end up paying quite a bit for dessert, which a lot of other places will do for free..."}
{"text":"SO FREAKING DELICIOUS  Guu Izakaya is a Japanese Tapas chain (exists in Vancouver too), and I love that everyone who works here is legit Japanese. The drinks are tasty (not so strong, but very tasty), the food was delicious and while portions were small I felt the value was there.  I lovedddd the sashimi salad, the cod (moist, flavorful, delicious), rice dishes (unagi, rice and cheese? it works!).   Skip the pickled veggies, stewed pot dishes.  Be prepared to wait in line, I don't think they take reservations! While you wait, grab a drink at their bar :)"}
{"text":"OH-EM-GEE!! We have one in Montreal and evidently I went many times. But there was just something about this place which makes me want to give it a few more brownie points. The food was impeccably flavored, the service was fast and the place was vibrant. Be ready to be surrounded by a lot of noise, because their concept is to be lively and orders will be shouted across the restaurants by the waiters. Please do take the time to reserve as this place is in high demand. Take note that you will only have your seats for a period of two hours to give other clients the chance for a dining experience. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is incredible. Creative menu, solid (but very loud) service, great environment, always a lineup--it lives up to the hype!  My favorite dessert in the city--almond tofu cake. This tofu cake is more like a silky smooth jello. The almond flavour comes out SO beautifully, I wish real almonds would taste as vibrant and floral as this!"}
{"text":"this location is perhaps even more lively than its sister location at bloor and bathurst! but there tends to be a bigger lineup and a lot longer wait here than there is up there.   I recall having to wait for more than an hour before getting a seat, and that's completely normal here. I'd say the experience and the quality of food is worth the wait.  go try yourself and see!"}
{"text":"Really fun atmosphere and great staff. The karaage and yakiudon were both pretty good. Also really liked the almond tofu. I would've liked to try some of the other sakes, the Guuud sake was just alright."}
{"text":"Love this place! The atmosphere, the food, the staff, everything is amazing! When you walk in, the staff welcomes you (loudly) in Japanese which is very fun! The place has a coat hanger at the very front so that's very convenient.    The only problem that I have is with the menus. The layout is very confusing and it's a pretty overwhelming menu. Since I've been there many times I've gotten used to the menu but whenever I go there with new guests, they get very confused and overwhelmed!   Also, they have a side menu that features their sashimis and specials and it's printed (black and white) on a white piece of paper which again, is incredibly overwhelming.   Another drawback is that you can't make reservations on weekends (which a lot of places don't either) but since the place gets packed and it's relatively small, it would be nice to be able to make reservations for large groups!  Whenever you order, the staff yell out your order and the other staff yell It out as well which again, is very fun in my opinion but if you're the kind of person that gets annoyed easily (or you're just a boring person! Hah!) then I don't recommend this place  Overall, thumbs up! If you love Japanese food and loud places, then this place is perfect for you! Happy eating!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome fun. Went on a Tuesday and partied like it was Friday. Rowdy and friendly and oh so unique.  The no reservation poilcy sucks but I get that they don't want tables sitting there unoccupied. The packed house adds to the ambiance.  One caveat, they don't allow sake bombs! Booooooo!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto! The atmosphere is second to none and the food.. Let's just say I have a craving at least once a week. I have never ordered something I didn't like, everything is amazing and made with care. My favourite place to sit if I'm not with a big group is up at the bar in front of the kitchen because there's actually more counter space than the tables and it's a nice view! Drinks are also great here, just the right amount of booze every time!"}
{"text":"It's a fun little escape from your traditional restaurant setting. You are always greeted loudly by the whole staff as you walk in. It is very noisy, which some people may not enjoy. They have a patio which would be better if you want to have a conversation with your date.  Food portions are smaller than what you would expect. You are meant to go with a few friends and order a bunch of dishes to share. This is a great place for drinking, and is my go-to place for Sapporo pitchers with friends."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. They have authentic japanese food, including fried chicken cartilage (yesss), and deep fried salmon skin. Don't worry - they have all the favourites that non-asian people can eat too :) I just mention it because it really felt authentic. Staff is actually japanese, and not chinese or korean look-alikes. Everything was absolutely delicious. Yes, it's extremely noisy, it's an izakaya!"}
{"text":"We went for our anniversary dinner on a Saturday evening. The restaurant is strict on a 2 hour seating limit. I found it a bit odd because it often took a while for our orders and we barely made it within the limit. However the service and food were great. I loved the tapas style of the place which allowed us to try a lot of stuff. We had pork belly, Hamachi sashimi, salmon belly sashimi sashimi, jellyfish, this great octopus with wasabi, beef carpaccio, edamame and beef udon. We loved everything except the udon which was ok. Very creative and delicious food selection overall."}
{"text":"Loud! Best word to describe the place. From the moment you enter you are greeted with a hearty loud welcome from the entire staff and you are treated with a similar reaction upon leaving. I don't understand Japanese but I would like to think they were saying \"Welcome! We are pleased to have you\" and \"thank you very much please come again!\". This happens A LOT, so when you are talking to your friend and you hear the entire staff yelling, it signifies someone is either entering or leaving. Needless to say by the time your leave the place you will notice you have become a little deaf lol.  It was my first time trying this place out and although it is under new management, the place is (from what friends tell me) the same as Guu. Hence the entire menu follows the same line as Guu where each item on the menu is small portions. I tried the hot pot and went with the chefs discretion (he would choose the 6 items to be placed in the hotpot). My hotpot came with Fishcake, tarojelly, deepfried tofu, egg, bamboo shoot, and raddish. It was very hot and tasty.   The place was busy and it took sometime for our food to arrive (won't necessarily recommend this to people who are very hungry: again small portion and long wait period). But the experience was good. Will come back but after a while (like when I get my hearing back lol)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto! Think of it as Japanese tapas food. Great place for groups as the dishes are smaller and meant for sharing so you are able to try a lot of different things. I've taken a lot of people here and it's always a hit.   Everything on the menu is great, but the must tries are the Brie Cheese (deep fried cheese), Ebimayo (deep fried prawns), Karaage (deep fried chicken), Kakimayo (baked oyster with cheese). These are my favourite dishes and always crowd favourites. Other notable mentions include the udon and bibimbap!   Feeling boozy? All of their cocktails are great, but if you want something more adventurous get the Sake Bomb. If that's not enough try the Seven Samurai. Both options, get ready for some shots, chugging and lots of yelling! Definitely something to try at least once!"}
{"text":"I  couldn't  wait to  try  this  place  after  discovering  it on Yelp and seeing all their  pictures  on instagram.  I got The Geographer (gin,  of course ) and it was  extremely   delicious .  We then got the octopus, lamb ribs, and some duck  dish ,  in addition to  some rice. Every  meal  had its own  originality  to it, whether it's the meat-veggie  combination , or the spices and flavours of the  meal . Every  very first  bite was  nearly  like a surprise, and  eating  here was  a lot  of  enjoyable .  The wait time for each  dish  was reasonable.  Everything  is  indicated  to be shared so it  felt like  I was  continuously   eating ! The  portions  were all on the  smaller sized  end and if you are  a big  eater,  keep an eye out for  your wallet!!   Something  I  likewise  liked about the  location  was the interior  decor ."}
{"text":"It's loud! Not recommended for dates unless you don't want to talk. Though the patio is quiet. I love this place. I come here all the time because I like the staff, the prices, the beasty beer and the array of options that they have. One time my friend ordered a shrimp dish, and she was under the impression that the shrimps were gonna be cooked--or at least without their heads still attached. Being the silly girls that we can sometimes be, we hid the dish behind a little statute that they had at the bar (we were seated at the bar). Well, one of the waiters saw the plate and asked us about it. I am sure I was blushing out of embarrasement when I admitted that we did not want to look at the eyes and heads of the shrimps. The waiter then said that he would \"fix\" it for us. He came back shortly with headless shrimps that were perfectly deep fried. Score!"}
{"text":"I came to this place thrice. The first time it was good during lunch, the second time it was okay the third ..well its confusing. The food was good , small portions but taste was very good. so what made me give a two star rating? Service. the guy that meets you in the front was very very unaccommodating in fact very rude and irritating to say the least. There was a mix up in the reservations. According to this guy host  he could not find our reservation. he was about to turn us down but seeing that there were a lot of empty tables my sister suggested why not be seated in one of them the host turned to tell us that they were reserved , so we asked when and it turned out the reservation wasn't for another hour. Seeing that we were already there and we were hungry we suggested why not take one table and just move to another when the time was up. I actually see the sense in this set up seeing that there were walk ins and they were accommodated. long story short we got the table, we had our food which was awesome (must try their dessert the green tea cheesecake and macha creme brûlée !!) but the service was totally crap! the guy kept coming back reminding us that we were under time limit??! WTF?!. guess what , by the time the guests for the 8pm reservation came - we were already having dessert and their full party of 10 wasn't even complete yet. I as glad I was able to bring my favourite people to try he food already coz I definitely won't be making a return. There are lots of good places to try. Sorry but not sorry"}
{"text":"Izakaya très original. Le menu est composé de petits plats à partager en groupe. Nous avons adoré la pieuvre ainsi que les crevettes tempura et le carpaccio wyu. Le sake nous a été servi dans une pousse de bamboo, belle touche. L'ambiance est électrique et saura ravir les amateurs du genre. À essayer et réessayer !"}
{"text":"Man, I always have a great time here.  My first time was for a friend's birthday a few years ago and didn't really know what to expect. The wait is insanely long (topping 2+ hours at the worst of times), especially in the winter when it's freezing cold. They have outdoor propane heaters, which help, but no one wants to wait more than 15 minutes outside when it's below 0 outside.  However, if you can wait it out in even in the coldest of weather, you'll be warmed up by the servers' and cooks' bright and welcoming greetings, traditionally shouted out in Japanese. How fun! They seat large groups very well, and have a cute patio for the summer.  The food! Izakaya is Japanese bar food and snacks, so all items listed are small dishes that are meant to be consumed with beer at a bar. Guu does great traditional small plates like takoyaki and karaage chicken, but also very interesting and fresh takes on typical izakaya fare. All of the food is wonderful and I've never had a bad meal there. The plates are small and are meant to be shared, almost like tapas so it's fun to order a bunch of different things and try them all. They have seasonal specials and I always love to see what's new to try. I was worried, when the plates arrived, that I would still be hungry but I was pleasantly surprised that it only took 4-5 dishes and a dessert between 2 people to be satisfied.   The staff at Guu are always so wonderfully chipper and pleasant and they really treat you when it's your birthday. I've seen plenty a birthday party held at this high energy restaurant and they get the whole place going to wish the birthday boy or girl a good one. So. Much. FUN! The music is great and sets the mood for a fun night, and the atmosphere is just buzzing with the high spirits of the staff. Never had a bad experience here. Can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Great food, not too pricy, portions a little bit small, but I guess it's expected with Japanese cuisine. The best part tho was the atmosphere, this place is for sure something different! ;) I recommend it to everyone in Toronto. Especially before heading to the club or bar, go there for pre-drinks, grab something to eat and get in the party mood. I don't recommend it to people who like silence. It's very loud!"}
{"text":"This place is so high quality. First of all, it's loud. As in hard to talk to your neighbour loud. Reminds me of a bustling and constant noise in a fish market. Really welcoming atmosphere but it does get overwhelming and defs isn't suitable for a first date. Everyone was super friendly The tapas come out to 8 or 9 dollars each. Portion sizes were great for sharing between 2 people. The food tasted really fresh and the variety of flavours of different dishes was vast. We got pork belly, karage, salmon carpaccio and short ribs. I'd say the karage and pork belly were highlights, both better than what I've had elsewhere. The short ribs fell short, really weren't special at all. I've had better at all you can eat. The salmon was good but nothing compared to BC sashimi of course.  My friend joked that we had all kinds of meat but turkey for thanksgiving! Bill was more expensive than normal for 2 people ($60 with tax and tip) but it was defs worth the treat"}
{"text":"This place is fun. Lots of yelling; it seems like a fun place to work. The food is pretty good though a bit pricey for what it is. I liked most items but the one I did not like at all was the bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms and scallops dish. It was quite terrible. The texture as well as the flavour made me want to hurl. I think the bacon may have been bad as well. The rest was good."}
{"text":"A Guu in Toronto! I can't quite believe it's finally become reality. However, although my  Vancouverite sister's forewarning that \"not all Guu's are created equal\" rang true, I chose to call the big city my adopted home and this is (for now) as guu'd as it gets.  This east coast Guu's uber bright and high ceiling'd space is very modern. The seating options consist of rows of long picnic tables as well as a considerable L-shaped bar. The layout makes it appropriately squishy, but in the North American sense of the word to accommodate our larger personal bubbles. The atmospherically noisy shouted greetings and orders on top of the happy chatter of the consistently full house are most reminiscent of a proper izakaya.   We arrived at 6:20pm on a midweek night to nab the very last two seats facing the service bar. I would've preferred to face the kitchen prep, but hungry and thankful beggars won't be choosers. The line up that promptly began to form against the wall thereafter numbered upwards of 20 salivating people until we left way before our 2-hour seating limit.    The service was a little slower and less efficient than I have come to expect from this chain. To be fair, it was busy busy busy! But then again, so are all Guu's and all the izakayas in Japan. I look forward to future visits when I'm hoping these kinks will eventually work themselves out.  The food was tasty and the menu is a good representation of this specialized type of Japanese fare. Flying salmon and tuna in from BC and scallops from Hokkaido may be cause for a dilemma for locavores and other environmentally minded folks alike, but hey, at least you're saving the environment from the carbon footprint that you would've left by flying there yourself.   Food-wise, the mouthwatering (and sometimes Engrishy) multi-ingredient descriptions of the sauce and condiment heavy dishes speak for themselves. My only recommendation is an often overlooked side dish of ultra creamy tobiko daikon salad with itty bitty scallops. Try it! You won't regret it.  Since drinking is such a big part of izakaya culture, the drinks menu is as substantial and varied as that of the food. The options of sake, shochu, chu-hi, or a jumbo glass of Japanese draft beer (practice saying it: \"nama beer-u\") with your food are all good. The aloe vera vodka that I chose to go with was both refreshing and went down way too easy. Slurping while eating your noodles is a must in Japanese culture. I just hope that making loud sucking noises out of my emptied glass of ice was okay too. Kompai!"}
{"text":"The moment you enter, you are greeted by the entire staff at Guu. They are incredibly enthusiastic as they yell at you in Japanese to welcome you. Deep down, I felt like a celebrity. Just kidding!  I have always been a fan of Guu Izakaya since it opened in Vancouver. It is a really exciting and fun restaurant to go for drinks with your buddies. Always packed and full of excitement! The food here is also really good. I have tried almost everything and have to say you can't really go wrong with anything. My top picks will be Okonomiyaki, Takoyaki, Gindara, Gyu Tongue and Kakimayo.   For the people that are not familiar with Izakayas, it is basically Japanese tapas. I would highly recommend going with a group of 4-5 people. This way everyone gets to sample a little bit of each dish and easier to be seated since it is a busy restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is a strong four stars. Beautiful plating, delicious stuff. It's lovely to find a Japanese restaurant in Toronto that doesn't specialize in sushi or ramen. Definitely a standout amongst the throng of 5+ other Japanese places just a few minutes from here.  We came right before last call at lunch (2pm) - they don't admit new customers, but you are free to sit there and eat. Service staff was very nice and accommodating. Blizzard happening outside so we stayed till 4:40pm without question. Fantastic service, happy & outgoing guys, could not recommend this part enough.  Now, for the food. The descriptions that they went with on the menu didn't make me salivate, but the food did. For small plates, ordered the okonomiyaki (fried squid pancake drizzled with mayo & tonkatsu sauce) and takoyaki (exquisite deep fried squid balls drizzled with mayo & tonkatsu sauce). Both were delicious - especially piping hot immediately when served. Crispy on the outside, melt-in-your-mouth soft on the inside. Fairly authentic, Osaka-style, if I remember correctly.  Super yummy, but the tonkatsu sauce + mayo was a bit overkill. I wouldn't say it drowned out the flavor, but it made the meal pretty heavy - good for feeling full, but next time I probably wouldn't order two dishes that were that similar... Sauce was getting a bit too much and we were bored and full of it.  The kaarage don was okay and on the smaller side, but nothing to write home about. Miso on the salty side, salad pretty lacklustre. Both of us have \"small\" stomachs and we were satiated, but not full. For the price, the serving sizes are mediocre, not great. We finished off with a small slice of delicious matcha cheesecake which was drizzled with chocolate sauce and presented with a dollop of whipped cream.  All in all, above and beyond for service and atmosphere, a light 4 for the food. Looking forward to come back to get my Japan fix!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! My friends and I, who all lived in Tokyo for a time, met up here for a reunion. We ordered the set menu for $25/person and found it was a great amount of food! They have beers as big as your head! and the cocktails are good if you aren't a beer person. The sexy geisha drink was a table fav! It's a really loud and lively environment so like the other reviews said, don't go if you want to have a quiet conversation or if anyone in your group is hearing impaired. We ended up getting a table on the heated outdoor patio section which worked out really well for our group. It was warm and cosy but it worked!  My only complaint is the server we had at our table. He wasn't personable at all and seemed very keen to get us to leave. He gave us our \"30 minutes left and no more ordering\" talk around 40 minutes before our 2 hours were up and refused to bring my friend a drink when there was still plenty of time left. Then he came and told us that people were waiting for our table. When we told him we still have 10 minutes left he wasn't apologetic at all and was generally a very unpleasant individual. Everyone else working there seemed great so hopefully this person won't be working the next time I go!"}
{"text":"Woo! 150th review of Guu! (Yeah, that rhymes!)   (disclaimer: someone stole the 150th the moment I posted this. YAY 151!!!)  I went to Guu for my birthday on a Monday night at around 8pm, and didn't have to wait for a table at all (though some people who came in right behind us did!). Even if we had waited, it would have been worth it. I love the environment, and how every time the staff have to yell welcome or goodbye, they do it with real enthusiasm!   Not only that, but the food was beyond amazing. Favorite was definitely scallop sashimi, but I didn't have anytihng that I wouldn't have again!   AND if you buy a birthday dessert (or barter with your waiter), they will sing you the most epic restaurant birthday song of all time. At the time, I was embarassed, but looking back it was awesome!   In conclusion, DEFINITELY GO HERE."}
{"text":"The people who work there are friendly and passioned! If you are tired or upset, it's really a great place for cheering yourself up! And the food there are delicious! Strongly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Guu three times and never been disappointed. Staff has been attentive, atmosphere is great, it isn't cheap unless you're eating lunch, but it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Food: despite all the hype on yelp, Kinoko Bibimbop was okay for me. Great to have it served sizzling in a black stone bowl but it tasted like something I could make at home by stir frying rice, mushrooms and seaweed flakes to a spoonful of leftover seafood hot pot. That said, Salmon Tataki was pretty good.    Service: I enjoyed their table side presentation of some dishes; mixing some ingredients together in front of you. You may be wowed by very enthusiastic staff that would scream out some Japanese making you feel welcomed. During my visit, there were two birthday guests and the whole restaurant was in a festive mood when as many staff as possible would gather and sing out the Happy Birthday Song. Each birthday guest got five or six shots to drink up.   But since it was difficult to talk over all these yelling, the staff really needed to come by our table more often to ask if we needed anything. Somehow, they had missed one of my friends' order and she still didn't get her dish while the rest of us finished eating our respective dishes (probably more than half an hour passed). It took us more time and getting the attention of, then speaking to about three staff to get that sorted out. When we finally got our bill, the server miscalculated so we had to wait for cash refunds. We would have overpaid if we did not notice something was off on our bill. This place was not my type of dining experience when I had to raise my voice to engage in a conversation. If you're like me, ask for a patio seating where it would be somewhat quieter."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with couple other friends while I was visiting Toronto. I have been to many Izakaya in Tokyo, so I was on the fence going to this spot. From what I get, it is a busy restaurant overall so I would recommend that you make reservations if you don't want to wait for a long time. Once you arrive, the staff great you loudly, it is very common to that in restaurants in Japan. If you are looking for a quiet dinner, this is not you spot. Think of Izakaya as tapas, you get a bunch of stuff and you share with people.   We order the following:  1) Salmon Natto Yukke, if you never had Izakaya or Japanese food, I would say stay away from this. If you are curious and have a sense of adventure, go for it. The texture is very slimy.   2) Gyu carparccio was good. It comes with wasabi sauce on top. Nothing strange about it.   3) Karaage fried chicken, nothing super exciting about this one. It is friend chicken with mayo on the side   4) Takoyaki, some people called them octopus balls. Not they are not octopus testicles. They are potato ball with a piece with octopus in it. Be super careful when you want to take a bite. They usually super super hot and most of people end up burning their mouth. That ain't fun for no one.  5) Brie cheese, this is pure indulgence nothing more   6) Eggplants, I am a big fan of eggplants. I order them everywhere I go. The were good, if you want some veggies with your meal. It is a good option.   7) BBQ pork belly, pretty delicious. I would recommend this. It was well cooked and crunchy from the outside   8) Almond tofu, this remind me of eating flan if you are familiar with it.   9) Cheese cake, it is a matcha cheese cake. All I have to say   I would go back to this spot again. I enjoyed the ambiance, the staff was super nice and helpful."}
{"text":"\" You're gonna wait TWO hours, you'll see!!\" 45 minutes later, we were in. Being served by a Japanese waitress from Oksaka. A delight, always smiling! I love... sorry, really love the staff. One thing I love is good food, good vibe, good booze/saké (which I remind when you buy their local homemade)( saké 15% goes to help the victim of japan)). It's uber pack but they have manage to create a well rounded system to make things go fast. I cannot had much more detaisl as previous Yelper:Mouthwash in the bathroom, All staff massif japanese: Hello!  Listen, the food is very good, the Kirin beer is amazing. Takiyaki is a must as for the okonomiyaki. the Greens are good. Only thing I would have liked is a structure on how it comes to your table. We ate in the patio, way less noise, it was nice!  Back in Toronto means going back to Guu Izakaya,"}
{"text":"This place is so incredibly delicious that I went back three times in a single week!   Having tried 90% of their menu, I've put together a list of my absolute favourite dishes:   5/5 1) Pork Belly - I have dreams about this melt-in-your-mouth delightful dish!  2) Baked Oysters - these are quite heavy, but that may only be because I personally ate 2 orders. Extremely delicious!  3) Karage - this is hands down the best fried chicken I've ever had; definitely the best karage in the city!  4/5 1)Octopus Balls - absolutely delicious!  2) Seared salmon - extremely flavourful! 3) Rapini and Mushroom side - truly fantastic; it's the perfect texture - not too soft nor too crunchy. They also add the perfect amount of garlic and oil - it doesn't overwhelm the dish or make your lips wet, but adds a hint of delicious flavours!   Overall, I truly don't think you can go wrong here. In addition to phenomenal food, the environment is extremely upbeat and welcoming. You're greeted with a synchronized hello from the entire wait staff, great 90s tunes play all night long, and the happiest sake bomb chant comes on at least twice hourly.  Highly, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"There are a million jokes one could make about how Guud this place is, but a simple pun sums it up...  I had never been to a Japanese \"tapas\" bar until Guu, but I can't even fathom how another could compete. Literally everything on the menu is mouth watering. The dishes are perfectly prepared, and you can really tell that care went into the crafting and creation of every one.  The ambiance is also quite lovely, but you'll be so distracted by the food that you won't even notice.  Irasshaimase!"}
{"text":"What's not to love?  Came here Memorial Day weekend with my cousin and 2 friends. (This was 3 months ago and I still remember it.)  The food was excellent, loved the variety and trying flavors that we never thought would be good. For example, we ended our meal with black sesame ice cream. WOW. I usually don't like black sesame desserts, but this was sooooooo good. Light, delicate sesame flavor and not too sweet.  I would drive the 10 hours just to eat here again. However, I must plead: PLEASE COME TO CHICAGO!!!!! =)  (A little warning though: if you don't like communal seating or strangers gawking at your dishes, don't go. Otherwise, go go go!)"}
{"text":"GUU!!! I love love love this place! It's a treat from the moment you come in-- such lively and enthusiastic service goes very well with a vibrant menu. Portions are small but so worth the price, and once you're here you just want to keep ordering more. Everything is absolutely delicious and creatively served in pretty little plates. My ultimate favorite was the salmon tataki, lightly seared at the edges and topped harmoniously with scallions, toasted garlic, and Japanese mayo. The maguro tataki was equally impressive. I also loved the takoyaki balls and although some people may think it's common fare, it's one of those things I always look for at Japanese restaurants especially izakayas. The special of the day was great-- hands down the best sashimi I've had in a long while. I say when at Guu, just eat eat eat... and yes, pour on the sake!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour and go here. Super fun and friendly with great Japanese tapas. Definitely grab a group of friends so you can split the costs and order a bunch."}
{"text":"Pork and fried chickenis great! The place is little bit loud, but environment is funny."}
{"text":"This is a great place where the food here will literally make the taste buds in your tongue dance all night. Although it can be a little loud (the staff here greets everyone who enters through the door with a Japanese greeting) The atmosphere and decor here is casual, warm and rustic. The servers are very friendly, helpful and attentive, and the food reasonably priced, freshly prepared and served in a timely manner. If you order several dishes, they will usually bring them out one at a time so you have less clutter on your table. My favourites? Lets start with the $5 Sake bombs :) A shot of Sake with a small cup of beer, the fried chicken (which is marinated and very moist despite being deep fried), the Sashimi salad, and the Sashimi Octupus were the highlights of my meal. 2 people can enjoy a very good meal here with several courses, tea,  beverages and desert for under $100 with tip and taxes included. My only issue is the lack of parking. There is limited street parking just around the corner, and a paid lot next door which is very pricy. If you live in this area or close to it, public transportation is your best option. I would also highly recommend making reservations, and you can easily make them on their website or their Yelp application. They also send you a reminder and send you a text where you can re-confirm your reservation. Loudness aside, this a great place to enjoy a meal with your friends and family or a group."}
{"text":"An izakaya (???) is a type of Japanese drinking establishment which also serves food to accompany the drinks. We are familiar with Japanese food, and we thought we would just give this a try and were pleased with the choice. The place is is loud and rowdy. Good place to socialize after work, modern Japanese pub. Not overpriced.  Started with a crispy shrimp appetizer, that turned out to be a bowl full - easily enough to be a meal for one person. Also had the beef with some vinegar sause, which was medium rare and excellent. For entrees, the Black cod and udon noodles came out luke-warm and went back for re-heating but was very tasty. Also had the oyster, which was very good. This is not a quiet place. There were three birthday parties in the room."}
{"text":"YES! YES! A MILLION TIMES YES!  I was only in Toronto for a few days, and this was the first restaurant that my group stopped at when we were here. It was SOOO good, that we came back another night!  Guu. If I remember correctly, that's the sound your stomach makes when it's full and happy, and my stomach said Guu all the way back to my hotel!  Service: If you've never been to a Japanese restaurant with this time of environment, you're in for a treat! The atmosphere is friendly, and you can't help but smile and laugh when you're here. The servers are really nice, but it's not the place for a quiet meal. If possible, make a reservation. I think we got lucky both times. Apparently, it's pretty tough to get a seat without calling in some days.  Food: The quality of the food is out of sight! The menu is broken up to specials, that are based on availability, and more of the consistent items. - Octopus with Wasabi Stem. This is a MUST. It's delicious, and I'm still looking for wasabi stem here at home. - Jellyfish. It's another appetizer that you have to try. It's sliced into small pieces and nice and crunchy. - Beef Tongue. It's good, but you don't get that much. - Sea Urchin. WOW! I love sea urchin, and this is one of the best I've ever had. You only get a few slices of the orange delicacies, but they are so well-prepped and flavorable. It's SOO worth it! Unfortunately, it's not available everyday. - Salmon Natto Yukke. I liked the presentation a little more than the actual dish. If I had to pass on a dish, it'd probably be this. - Bibimbap. It was good, but, again, you don't get that much, and it's not too different from bibimbap that you get anywhere else. - Mint Mojito Beer. I know, it sounds weird, but it's pretty good. It's worth trying. In fact, try out any of their drinks. I think most of them are unique."}
{"text":"This was my first Toronto Guu experience with a friend of mine, and I must say I absolutely loved it.  I didn't anticipate the loud atmosphere as the Kitsilano location was very quiet in comparison, but I was definitely a fan.  Dinner and a show!  We ordered the Takowasabi, Salmon Natto Yukke, Okonomiyaki, Takoyaki, and the Kinoko Bibimbap.  I had a Cherry Blossom and Passion to drink, while my friend had a Bamboo.  For me, the highlights were the okonomiyaki and the takowasabi.  I've always wanted to try okonomiyaki and so I was ecstatic it was on the menu.  My friend mentioned that is was crispier than the dish is normally served, however I was a fan of this as I prefer that to mushy.  I thought that it was quite flavourful and I enjoyed the sauces on it.  My favourite was definitely the takowasabi though as I was totally unprepared for it.  This dish is spicy!  The best part is that it's not a lingering, burning, my-mouth-is-on-fire kind of spicy, it's spicy while it's in your mouth, but once you swallow the spice is gone.  It definitely wasn't the most appetizing to look at, but I loved the flavour.  As for the drinks, I felt like both the Cherry Blossom and Passion were a little on the sweet side.  I think that if they used something other than 7Up to curb the sugar in the  Cherry Blossom that would help, and the Passion was a little too much lychee for me.  I'm a fan of Soho, but this was a bit like getting slapped by a lychee fruit.  Loved the ramune though, I can never get enough of that stuff!  This location is definitely as delicious as the Kitsilano location, and this warms my heart.  I'll definitely be back, and I'm already craving the Ebimayo (my favourite dish out in BC)!"}
{"text":"Guu has been so hyped up from everyone I know, so I had pretty high standards coming in.  Food: It was lunch so my friends ordered udon, but based on the recommendations below, I really wanted to try stuff off their tapas menu. I ordered the takowasabi (marinated octopus and wasabi stem), ikipiri (deep fried calamari with spicy ketchup and wasabi mayo), takoyaki (fried octopus balls), and almond tofu. The food is honestly SO GUU'D. You can really taste the wasabi flavour in the takowasabi and it also comes with nori squares on the side. Unlike the takowasabi, I couldn't quite taste the wasabi in the ikipiri, but instead the sauce was more sweet like Chinese sweet-and-sour chicken?? Takoyaki was fresh and hot when it came out. The almond tofu was alright; it came in a little cup and was pretty smooth but nothing special in my opinion. The price for the amount of portion per person is so sad living on a student budget... Definitely come in a larger group so you can order lots more and try lots of different things!  Service: Their greetings are my favourite!!! I find it super cute to get that kind of service! Aside from their loud hellos and goodbyes, food came out reasonably promptly and our water was refilled without asking.  Atmosphere: It was around 1:30 when we went so we got seats immediately and it wasn't noisey at all aside from their greetings. For sure, will come back next time as a larger group after dinner when things get more livelier/fun.  Solid Japanese tapas bar."}
{"text":"5/5 for sure! Right off the bat, the reservations were very easy to make (made them through YELP), and they even followed up with a confirmation text a few days leading up to the event.   I came here for my birthday with a few of my friends and the experience was phenomenal. As soon as you enter the door, you are greeted with an outburst of japanese waiters who make you feel welcomed. The place is not too big, hence the reason for reservations to be made.   Food - As a group of 6 we decided to split and share a bunch of food items. We tried  *Karaage - which was HUGE! It came with about 4-6 pieces and they were the size of about a small fist or less, but definitely worth it.  *Ikapiri - calamari in sweet/spicy like sauce. They sprinkled crispy onions on the top of it, making the texture crispy, yet soft at the same time.  *Takoyaki - octopus ball, with flour and a piece of octopus in it. Pretty flavourful and good. Presentable. Even texture throughout, but could use a little bit of a bigger piece of octopus on the inside. Be careful when biting into it, it might be a little hot!! Rich in flavour, but not too heavy.  *Kinoko bibimbap - was better than the kimchi bibimbap in comparison, but both were really good. This bibimbap was focused on mushrooms, with a variation of seaweed. MMMM YUM! We ended up ordering two!  *Kimchi bibimbap - very flavourful. More focused on flavour rather than spice. It's not too bad, but I prefer the Kinoko bibimbap.  *Birthday assorted desserts - Came with grapefruit, almond pudding, 2 slices of caramel/coffee roll cake?, and black sesame & coconut icecream.   AMAZING 5/5 QUALITY JAP FOOD EXPERIENCE! Defeinitely would recommend.   Drinks- Try out these FUN drinks if you want to have a blast with your friends. They make it a whole experience and get everybody's attention in the restaurant. This is worth the video recording and definitely worth the try if you come here, you should get at least one of these drinks. THURSDAYS -- $3!!  *Sake bombs - Sapporo beer & Sake shot sitting on top of chopsticks.  *Samurai bombs - Sapporo beer & Fruity drink mix & Sake Shot --huge!!  Service/Environment - Excellent. Attentive. They explained very well that the table is reserved after us for 9pm which is completely understandable, and still enough time to eat comfortable. They have fast food service, and even if  you order in a trickle (different dishes) -- they can cater to it (but it's better to order everything up front).    Parking- I parked at the pay for parking right across the restaurant. Very convenient. FUN.   Would 100% come back and recommend it to my friends. It makes you feel like you're in Japan, and you're immersed into their izakaya culture as soon as you walk through the doors. Please try this gem out!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night and it was packed. I waited in line just to get in to make put my name down for a table. The host said the wait was only about half an hour, so I gave him my number. 20 minutes later, they called and said my table was ready. Awesome!  They sat me outside, which was nice because it was a little quieter. I got to enjoy the nice summer Toronto weather while splitting a pitcher of fresh tasty Sapporo.  Got the yaki udon, which was actually the best yaki udon I've had in a long time. Also ordered the  baked mussels, tempura okra, and salt/pepper short ribs.  The best out of everything outside of the yaki udon were the baked mussels. Absolutely delicious, unfortunately they were gone before I knew it. The short ribs were hit and miss, some pieces were really flavorful, others were dry. The tempura okra had a lot of potential, but they needed a dipping sauce instead of a bowl of salt (yes, a bowl of salt is served with the tempura okra).   I highly recommend the baked mussels, you can't really go wrong if you like seafood."}
{"text":"Okay so this was the loudest restaurant I have ever been to. The place looks very tranquil from the outside. But as soon as you open that large wooden door, it is like a sonic blast of yelling and music. Honestly, it took me a pint and about twenty minutes to get over my shock. By the end of our tightly enforced two hour seating, I was enjoying the ear shattering greetings and goodbyes and I could almost make out the lyrics of the old school hip hop jams played in the background.   Straight up, the food was on point. We started with selections from the special menu. The sashimi was absolutely delicious and the salmon carpaccio was sweet and a bit smokey. But by far my fav was the beef tartar...that egg yoke just killed it!!! We tried so many dishes, some less memorable such as the tempura ocra and the shabu shabu beef, but others that were simple and stellar. The octopus and the udon with beef and mushrooms were so good I will dream of them.   And seriously, how can I not giggle when they were chanting my partner's name as we left?"}
{"text":"Guu has been on my restaurant wish list for a while now after reading many positive reviews and getting recommendations from friends.  We arrived around 7pm on a Thursday night and was told there would be a 40-minute wait for a table.  We added our name to the list and had a seat in the vestibule outside.  The heat lamp was not working but it was not a super cold night.  We were seated at the end of a large communal table and didn't get any neighbours until half way through our meal.  Our waitress gave us warm towels which was very nice to defrost my hands after our wait in the outside area.  We ordered the jumbo mug of Sopporo ($9.50) and the grapefruit vodka sour ($6).  Food-wise, we went with:  beef carpaccio ($6.50), takoyaki ($5), scallop and enoki mushrooms ($6), tontoro - pork cheek ($6.50), deep fried oysters ($6.80) and the kimchi bimbimbap ($8.80).  Food came super fast.  The bimbimbap was up first and then followed shortly by the rest of the items we ordered.  We dug in and just after a few pieces from each dish, I felt extremely full.  I also noticed that the majority of our items were deep fried so oily foods usually fill me up fast.  The oysters and the takoyaki were my favourite.  The pork cheek was underwhelming, just a few nubs of pork in a small bowl.    We decided to finish off with dessert - tempura banana with coconut ice cream and mango sauce ($6) and even dessert was deep fried.  I ordered a hot green tea ($1) to calm my stomach.  The atmosphere at Guu is lively and loud.  It was someone's birthday every 10 minutes.  The staff sing and shooters were delivered to their table.  The staff greet all those entering and exiting with a rowdy hello and goodbye.  Pumping Japanese dance music fills the room.  I was definitely entertained.  I equate our meal at Guu to a trip to the food building at the CNE.  Everything looks and smells good, but after you eat a poutine, a Beavertail, mini-doughnuts, fried chicken, deep fried butter, cotton candy, etc, two hours later, you end up on the couch in your underwear, nursing a bottle of Maalox vowing never to do that again.  It was Guu'd for what it was but I'm not a big eater of deep fry which is probably why I'm not dying to go back."}
{"text":"Therea so much good things to say about this place so I'm going to keep this short and simple with a few tips.   Food was really good. My most favourite was the baked oysters. 2 pcs for $7.50. Well worth it.  Majority of their plates were appetizer size. Its more of a restaurant to share different foods with good company  Atmosphere was very live. If you don't like loud places, I wouldn't recommend this place. I love how you're greeted once you've enter & how they show their appreciation when you leave.  Staffs were really friendly & always at your service. Never had to wait long  ***Make sure you make reservations or else you'll have to wait in a long line outside  btw they were very considered when they set up the washrooms for the ladies. e.g small basket of free pads if you're in need & mouth wash with mini disposable shot cups."}
{"text":"Came at around 11:45 where they just open and noticed that quite a few tables were already filled with people.  The moment we stepped in we were greeted super enthusiastically and the atmosphere was very lively!  The service was great because all the staff were smiley and happy (not the fake kinds lol) and they were quick and efficient. They were having fun and enjoying their jobs which makes dining here so much more comfortable! :D  The food was quite yummy but we didn't get to try a lot because they only served things from their lunch menu. Baked oysters, I will come back for u next time  ;-;  Overall, a wonderful place to go to with your friends, but come for dinner if you want to try a lot of different foods!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go for a drink and snack post-work!! There was no lineup when we went on a Thursday evening, but one formed as we were there.  Service  was kind of slow, but the place was busy and they were very cheerful so it was never an issue.    It's really loud there, but i'm sure you already know that. We ordered the sake sampler and a small 5oz bottle and it was all good.  The hot sake was REALLY hot, so try not to burn yourself if you're the eager type.  Takoyaki: It was really tasty but not the best i've had (lots of breading), but i'd definitely get it again. Calamari: It looked bright red and tasted awesome, served on rice paper (at least i hope it was rice paper since i devoured it too). Large pieces and not overly chewy made this dish perfect in my mind. BBQ Pork: This was the highlight of the night for me, it was a LARGE portion for the price and all the pieces were tender and soaked in a nice sauce.  Also the mustard they served with it had a big enough kick to notice it, but not overpowering. Bibimbop: It was OK.  Stonepot bowl of rice with mushrooms and spices.  Would have been nice if they gave us the red sauce that is usually served with it, as it was kind of dry without it.  Was expecting more than a $9 bowl of rice."}
{"text":"Great food - Japanese style tapas.   Top faves:  Fried chicken  Shrimp and avocado tartare  Fried shrimp  Fried Brie   Great service and lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"Delicious cod! The prices are so affordable. I love this place. I recommend it."}
{"text":"FOOD:  PRO: I am a big fan of their Baked Oysters. Takoyaki was good, but I've tried better ones. Though Kinka Izakaya has good presentation of their Takoyaki.  CON: The waitress recommended their special for that day which is their Teriyaki Chicken Wings so I was expecting that it would be really good. I was disappointed coz it is just MEH. They don't have maki here also, even though I think they should have them because it's a Japanese restaurant.   PRICE:  PRO: For the Oysters, I'd say you get the value from the money you paid for.  CON: For the Teriyaki Chicken Wings, it's not worth it. It's kinda expensive.  AMBIANCE:  PRO: The place has lively guests and crew. They greet everyone who enters and leaves the restaurant.  SERVICE:  PRO: Service was good. The waitresses were polite. CON: They are slow. You need to wait 15-30 minutes for your food."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday, good food and stellar service. Cozy, lively, and friendly atmosphere, the staff all greet you loudly as you enter the restaurant and are attentive to their patrons. The entire staff sings happy birthday to the birthday person, takes a group photo, and prints it out as well for us to take home."}
{"text":"Maybe it was an off day, but wow, what happened??  Came by recently on a weeknight dinner, and there were cute summer decorations with lanterns. The service was efficient as usual but the overall food and vibe seemed different. The music was uncomfortably loud (from a previously cool level to now club-like) and the yelling/cheering, which used to be fun, was even more forceful to compensate for the amped volume. I could barely hear anyone sitting beside me! We ordered all the old favs but while the menu prices stayed consistent, some plates got much smaller and the ingredient quality dropped a bit as well. My group left less full than expected and with some ringing in our ears, which has never happened before.  It's still a decent spot for group gatherings but probably not a go-to anymore if this keeps up."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  The food is really good, the staff are fun and very pleasant, and the atmosphere is so much fun.  I love all the shouting and singing that goes on.  The food is real izakaya bar food.  The bibimbap is so tasty, the chicken wings are incredibly memorable, the drinks are not all heavy-alcohol based.  I want to try everything on the menu now.  On one Sunday we were there in the afternoon and they had Japasta, a special creamy pasta with salmon, and I could have eaten about a pound of that all by myself.  =)  Kenta and the gang are just the sweetest people, and I basically want to go back every night that we can afford it. =)"}
{"text":"Love this place! In the heart of Downtown Toronto you can't experience a dine more better than the environment here. Although it is very loud it gets the people going!! Haha.. The food is great. Takoyaki balls, the sashimi salad, and much more! The customer service is great here. The only downside is that when during peak times the tables are small and can be a bit tight. Also the parking is pretty expensive cause you have to pay flat rate even if you're dining for just 45 minutes to an hour. Overall my experiences here have been wonderful, I highly recommend this place for anyone that isn't a newborn baby!"}
{"text":"Man, that was Guuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuud !   My most fav lady yelper friends and I hit up Guu on a Tuesday night. We were all Guu virgins and weren't quite sure what to expect, so we planned to arrive early and pray that we didn't have to wait.  We arrived promptly at 6pm and by stroke of luck managed to secure the last table with no waiting (good thing too because it was absolutely lashing outside!)  The service here was FAST. Wow. No messing around. We ordered 9 dishes and we finished eating and paid within an hour.  The atmosphere was crazy, despite having read most of the reviews, I wasn't expecting the loud shouts from the staff. After awhile, you tune them out, but you really have to yell to converse with your friends (Great place for an awkward date, no need to make conversation!)  We started the night off with a round of SAKEgria cocktails which were sake, fruit juice and fresh berries/fruits. Not bad for $6.  The food was all great. Tuna sashimi/tatake was gorgeous. Something bacon wrapped was delicious (I forget what it was, but who cares, it was bacon!) The Japanese style pancake was pretty fab too, and you can't go wrong with kimchi bibimbap. We finished off with a mixed hotpot dish, which admittedly had some bizarre ingredients going on.  Bill came to $35 each, including tax & tip - not bad, considering we had bevvies."}
{"text":"Thursday night around 5pm, party of 2.  I'd have to agree with Philip H.'s review. The food here was very underwhelming for the price. The atmosphere was fun and my Sapporo was cold, but my food was just meh.   Service - AWESOME! Everyone is friendly and loud. We were seated at the bar so our food was mostly served to us by the kitchen staff. Also we didn't have to wait in a line outside.  Food -  We tried just about everything: Smoked Salmon special - a good portion of salmon sashimi for the price. Maguro Tataki - really, really delicious. Takoyaki - avoid if you like octopus, you'll only get dough. Kaki Furai - the middle sauce is pink egg salad, what the frak? Another sauce is the same thing as on the pancakes and the third sauce is...salt? Pass. Kaki Mayo - YUM. Okonomiyaki - SO DELICIOUS. Enoki Hotate Bacon - pass it up, you cannot taste the scallop. I did not get to feel that buttery good texture against my tongue. I just got rubbery enoki and bacon that tasted like chicken. Yaki Udon - good noodles but nothing to write home about. Kinoko Cheese Bibimbap - just tasted like rice to me, the mushrooms were good.  We each had two desserts - the brown sugar cheesecake that had some sort of tempura (??) in it and another special of tempura green tea ice cream. I enjoyed both and the portions appear small but are perfect after a gluttonous feast.  Verdict - our bill came to about 102 with one glass of Sapporo and some cocktail for my friend. For about 3.5/9 (not including desserts) good things it wasn't worth it. A good experience but I might not be back for some time. Or I'll check out the other location."}
{"text":"Fun, crazy loud & tasty food! We went on a Monday night at 6:30 and had to wait 45 minutes which was no big deal. We sat on the patio and had some drinks (sake-gria). The food was delicious! We ordered 6 dishes - our favourites - cheese bibimbap, octopus balls (fried), short ribs, spinnach gommae (cold). We forgot to order the black cod...but will be back next time to try! Our dessert was banana tempura which was also delish. Yummmmmmmmm! I'll be back again with more people to try the rest of the dishes."}
{"text":"Good for small groups but not big groups. We are a group of 11 people and we asked to stay inside for our friends birthday - her first time here and we wanted to give her the experience. Because they wanted to keep small groups inside they didn't care for our request. At first they told us not to worry, they have a table for us. Half an hour later they said there was no room inside and only room is the patio and if we don't want it they will give it away! How rude! Their reason was that they had a 30 people reservation for inside. Wth?? Stay away if you are a big group!! Last time they wanted us to sit at the bar they told us the same, tables were \"reserved\", yet their policy was no reservations unless for 5pm seating. they manipulate us and does not respect our time.   So we sat in the patio and when we asked them to help us sing happy birthday to my friend, they said we can sing it on our own but they \"don't sing happy birthday in the patio\" ??!!   WILL NOT BE RETURNING!"}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends right after my late finance exam and I had a blast. The busy, loud and energetic crowd was definitely different and something im not used to when going out to eat but i absolutely loved it. There were a lot of things on the menu that we had no idea what they were but we decided to be spontaneous and order them. Their sashimi salad was amazing and probably the biggest plate we ordered. You do have to order a lot of dishes to get full and if you dont pay attention it could get a bit pricy. Overall, the standout for me was the banana tempura and coconut ice cream. The food was good, nothing special but i think thats because my friends and i didn't know what was good to order. I loved the vibe so i will definitely give this place another try especially since its so close to my school."}
{"text":"First of all, let me just say that I doubt there is another restaurant like this one in the entire beeping world. I would literally go back to Toronto simply to eat here.   Upon walking in, the staff (and customers) yell at you to greet you. They're blaring 90s pop and hip-hop hits and seating is family style at picnic tables. It's. So. Cool!!! We waited over an hour to eat here, and I would gladly wait another.   From what I could tell, their menu rotates frequently with specials that are flown in that day - and sell out FAST! Everything we ate was fantastic. I wish I had taken pics!   The other thing that is fantastic are the $5 saki bombs. And the fact that when you order one, your waitress starts a screaming chant that the entire restaurant joins in on - each time you order one. I felt a little bad because our server had to get another employee to lead the chant after we threw back so many she lost her voice.   Service was perfect. Food was impeccable. You are truly missing out on the experience of a lifetime if you decide to not come here!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Loads of energy. Price was actually quite good as well. Great place to take visitors."}
{"text":"They yell and act really excited when you come in! That was pretty sweet, if slightly awks.   I love the interior - it's hip, like a... rustic... japanese... hipster... pub. I hope that paints the right picture. It's very woody inside, which was surprising, but I liked it.   The food was delish. Lots of fried stuff, which s always good. I had an udon bowl that was tasty, and the fried chicken bites appetizer (sorry, can't remember what it's called). A friend ordered the fried octopus balls, and though I generally hate seafood, I tried them, and I didn't mind them! My fellow diner lived in Japan for a while, and she gave the place two thumbs up. We were here for lunch, but seems like it'd be fun for a late dinner.  PS: it took us like 5 minutes to find the door. I hope you fare better."}
{"text":"The food is really good! Get all the carpaccio! The drinks are reasonably priced and the atmosphere is fun. Just very loud but honestly if you're buzzed and down to have a fun time I think its good! The best part is the wait is not ridiculous, Friday night we waited for 15-20 minutes which honestly was not bad at all! I would recommend and come on a birthday for a super loud song or do the sake bomb for a very loud chant! I would pick this place over Nome any day!"}
{"text":"Brought a friend here for their bday, the servers were fantastic and so energetic! Great sake drinks, the one wine option tasted like grape juice and all the plates we tried were great for sharing and everything was delicious! Would recommend the eel rice gratin, takoyaki and ebi mayo!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun.  The small plates are great for sharing.  Good food, and drinks."}
{"text":"This was one of the most fun meals I've ever had. Who doesn't love constant cheering, awesome music, and fast and attentive service for their late night meals? We loved the beef tartare and the takowasabi. The other food was good, but nothing else really blew me away. I just loved the energy of this place and its inviting atmosphere. The drink prices were also some of the best in Toronto.   Will definitely stop in on my next trip."}
{"text":"I am from NYC, so there's no shortage of Izakaya. This place in Toronto is decent, but it was nothing to write home about. Their plates were a bit pricey, but they have some interesting items. The service was slow, and they tried too hard catering to  the large group with birthday specials (singing and all that)."}
{"text":"From the moment I stepped in this place seems to hug you. Warmth in the design of the wood through the restaurant with trendy light bulbs offer a perfect mix of modern yet authenticity in Japanese decor. Although there was a language barrier it was not an issue as the welcoming vibe of this place quickly makes you feel at ease. I had the Ramen and fell in love with the tastiness of the broth. Not too salty, each ingredient tastes wonderful. The pork meat was a bit tough for me but other than that it was great. From beginning to end this was such a great experience. I came in for lunch when I was calm and was told that dinner time was much more energetic however I found the calm environment to still contain friendliness and very good food. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Soo forking good! I love the atmosphere of this place, everyone cheers and says hello when you go and leave. The food is amazing, tapas Japanese style. We loved everything we tried. The price is pretty reasonable, pricey if you buy alot of alcohol and tapas. But definitely worth the celebration."}
{"text":"I've been to Guu several times since I first came here and no meal has disappointed, in spite of its high price tag. The reason why I'm writing an update for this place is because I wanted to make a record of the great night I had and the delicious food I ate.  We got here at around 6:30pm and there were noticeably a lack of people waiting out front, unlike the previous times I have been here. After giving my name to the server (they no longer take your phone number to call you back!) she informed me that I should come back to the restaurant in 20 minutes, when there is more room in the waiting room. \"So I have to wait for the waiting room?\" The server embarrassingly laughs and admits its absurdity.  This waiting room is what is usually the patio in the summer, with a heater and cover. People sit on benches and are allowed to order drinks. I like this a lot better than the previous standing outside in line wait.  We got the chef's table seat in front the kitchen. It's really memorizing to watch the number of dishes that can be created in such a small space.   The food: - kimchi udon - a must have every time I come here. I love how del dente the noodle is - grilled beef tongue - large portions, thick slices, very tasty and not gamy - grilled beef short ribs - a bit disappointing and too salty and did not go with the scallion oil it came with - tonkotsu ramen - (today's special and only available mondays to wednesdays) - the broth was very thick and flavourful, like a tonkotsu ramen should be and very del dente - deep fried oysters - comes in three sets of two. each set has a different flavour, one of which is just salt. It's so nicely fried that even without the dressing, it's delicious - uni sashimi - i didn't try this because im just not a fan - plum wine - so sweet and tasty  Other tried and true loves: - bi bim bap (any type, really) - baked oyster (my favourite dish) - deep fried calamari with spicy mayo and wasabi (another favourite) - deep fried brie cheese (a lot of ppl love it) - unagi doria (eel with rice, and cheese!) - matcha cocktail"}
{"text":"OK ... It took me a long while to make it to Guu.  I really didn't like the sounds of waiting in a long ass line, especially if it were outside without at least a drink in my hand.  So all the stars and moons aligned last night, for my birthday no less, and on this rainy, chilly tuesday night ... my wonderful date took me to enjoy the Guu experience, and voila, no line.  Still 85-90% full, but not like it usually is so I was told.  I thought it perfect.  Now - this place is NOT only about the food.  It is an experience that you're buying.  An experience worth every penny.  I didn't find it particularily expensive.  The mix of dishes were all fantastic, my favourite being the spicey calamari hands down.  The drinks were equally as interesting, with a simple vodka grapefruit coming with a fresh 1/2 grapefruit to squeeze and twist on a metal juice catching contraption to pour into your drink.  Mine had all kinds of fresh fruit within :) ...   I went with no expectations.  Open to whatever experience was thrown my way.  The only comparisons I have are the Hapa Izakayas in Vancouver, or Fin Izakaya at Yonge/Eg.  So I'll break it down for ya.  This is no Hapa.  For these reasons.  The staff at Hapa is off the charts gorgeous (for an example, see: http://www.ampedasia.com/article/Pinky-Peenkay-Tang-Interview/).  the staff at Guu are totally authentic Japanese .. funky clothes/style .. the kinda don't really give a shit look and attitude, but totally cool and smiley, laughing, and yeah - really loud shouting and singing.  Next, the decor of Hapa is super stylish and much much more accomodating (large tables/booths, a bar/lounge, etc.), whereas Guu is cozy, small wooden tables and equally small wooden box stools or communal tables with very little working space for your multiple dishes.  For Fin - it just isn't as busy, so you lose out on the entire \"experience' of a large staff welcoming you and singing at every momment, and screaming their good-byes in japanese as well.   Food-wise ... I was actually happy with all 3 of my Canadian Izakaya experiences.    The line and we don't take reservations attitude of Guu really works for them .. and will have to for its continued success and vibe (i.e. busy, loud and FULL restaurant).  I really hope they start serving up some sake for ppl in line and figure out a system for the winter months.  Cheers!  In summary:  - food  9/10 - style and decor:  8/10 - ambiance and vibe: 9.75/10  - cleanliness & presentation: 8/10 - service & timing: 7.5/10 - value for money: 8.5/10 - company (as in the people you're with companions) and conversation: 9.5/10 :)"}
{"text":"As you've prob already read, the staff is quite friendly (shall we say) in a typically Japanese way. I kinda like the rowdy nature though it would certainly become annoying after awhile. Sat at the bar nonetheless and ordered Snowpea Tempura, Karubi (shortribs), and Yaki Udon.  Tempura was the star of the show, hands down. Fresh, crisp greenery blends so well with light and flavorful batter, and their execution was right on. Delivery from fryer to plate was expedient, as it must be for good tempura. If I were to return, my next order(s) would be exclusively tempura (and possibly another fried dish).  I'll admit ordering shortribs was a mistake in hindsight, as this cut of meat turns decadent only after many hours of low-heat cooking -- the polar opposite of Japanese culinary tradition. Karubi was served bone-in and sliced thinly. Seasoned pretty well and cooked about as tender as is possible with ~1/8\" strips of meat, yet didn't stand out from other cuts of beef in the way I'm used to shortribs tasting. So much potential lost due to thin slices and cooking with high heat. But again, my fault here.  The Udon dish appeared with a huge amount of shredded seaweed piled on top. I removed most of this immediately since a little goes a long way in imparting bitterness & earthiness. Slippery Udon noodles and moderately flavorful cooking oils comprised the majority of flavor here. I added a splash of lime juice to bring some zing to the table. Two or three slices of beef helped keep things interesting but couldn't away the overall direction of this dish. Wasn't bad, really, but it was certainly boring. I left about half of it in the bowl.  Overall, come for the tempura; it's the sole reason I didn't give this place two stars. But I'm a tough grader who actually uses all 5 available ratings, unlike the majority of Yelp users who only use 3, 4, or 5. Come when you're in a good mood, order something fried, and you'll have a great meal!"}
{"text":"For Guu, I am torn between giving it 3-stars or 4-stars.  The ambiance here is great, as it is a festive and happening place.  It's a fun place to go with friends.  However, the food is prettier than it tastes and the wait can be very long.  It's also a trendy place with chefs that don't seem all that experienced when compared to traditional Japanese places, who focus a lot on yelling out Japanese phrases more than they should."}
{"text":"Amazing selection and quality! Thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Staff are friendly and exactly what you'd expect at an Izakaya restaurant."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Priced a little too high, considering the limited alcohol selection. Authentic and the food was excellent."}
{"text":"I am not always a big fan of Japanese food because unlike my friends I don't really like eating raw fish, something about the texture has always bothered me. However, this place offers enough choices for those non-seafood eaters that you can still participate in on the festivities and fun!  The place is very lively and can get quite loud. If you are aiming to meet up with friends and catch up over conversation it may be better to sit outside. Overall it is a fun lively place to go with friends."}
{"text":"GAIJIN have turned this place into an irish pub, wtf."}
{"text":"I've been here before, so the 1.5 hour wait for our 7 person party on Friday night, is not shocking. We just left our number and wandered over to the Loblaws to grab a coffee and chat. Good thing we did, because when we actually went to Guu and sat down, I couldn't hear what my friends were saying, even my friend sitting next to me! Loud! I liked it at first, felt festive....but after 40 minutes of it, it got a bit tiresome.  Food itself - I remember it was more spectacular than it was? The short ribs ordered was tough, almost like meat-flavoured gum! The drinks were delish, but lacking kick. We all walked out feeling only a little less hungry, and $40 less rich.  Overall....I think I can find other places with better food for these prices. And without that wait too!"}
{"text":"Kakimayo (baked oysters) is so delicious here....I get it every time I visit Guu.  For people with a budget, this is a drinking house (izakaya), so everything is pretty much snack-sized. Do eat before coming here...  Beef sashimi is also good! 10/10 recommend :)  Atmosphere is casual, loud, and cheerful. Good for casual hangouts and not ideal for serious catch-ups between your girlfriends. LOL."}
{"text":"Always a great time a Guu Original and Kinka at Sheppard/Yonge.  Fave bites: -takoyaki -salmon tatami -fried Brie -fried tofu -karage (but a bit fatty with skin on) -ebi tempura"}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised by this place. The staff and service was exceptional. Different menu than I'm use to but good. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Really fun atmosphere, and it was pretty loud and crowded when we got there around ten pm on a friday night. I didn't love the food but heard the Japanese was supposed to be really good here. Best dishes were kaarage & bbimbap.  I wouldn't come here for the food but moreso the fun atmosphere (get a sake bomb and see what happens)."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and food was great. The salmon belly was delicious and staff is super friendly. I love the vodka soda with fresh fruit. I did come here with my boys 13 and 10 as we were visiting. Probably not the best place for kids as most look like college students but they had fun watching all the action."}
{"text":"My friend reserved a reservation for us at around 6:30pm, the restaurant being about 80% full. Right when we opened the door, we were greeted by all the staff which scared me haha. We were seated right away and we made orders. We waited for around 10-15 minutes for the food, I thought they forgot about us since it took so long. With 3 of us, we ordered 3 dishes and one drink. We got the yakiodon (exactly like takoyaki but udon style), octopus sashimi (which really was cooked octopus), kaarage (good stuff) and the sake bomb (it was okay). The environment is very live, you'll heard screaming a lot as staff are really energetic. These dishes actually semi-filled us up which is a good thing! I'd go back here for sure as other reviews are spot on about this location."}
{"text":"Loved all the little tapas... everytime i crave kakimayo i know i'll be going to guu.  Also.. cheese bimbimbap... they have a few signatures that i love that no where else would have and this is what keeps me coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Love the the food they are serving here. Just had their qauil egg on Ikura sauce and Unagi Sushi. Tastes awesome. Definitely deserves another try!"}
{"text":"I have already written about Guu Sakebar for dinner, ill write about my experience I had during lunch. The atmosphere is a bit different compared to at night - its less busy or maybe I missed the lunch rush? But I enjoyed a quieter lunch with my friends. I didn't have to wait to be seat which is great!   I ordered the deep fried pork cutlet set, which came with 3 cutlets, 3 small pickled veggies, a salad, miso soup, potatoes and salad. The cutlets were fried very nicely, a perfect golden colour and not oily. My friends also ordered Gyu Don and a Japanese Hamburg Steak. I got to try bits of theirs and everything was really good!   I also ordered a Ramune Mojito, but they forgot it on the receipt and I asked about it and they didn't charge me for it, since they forgot to add it on originally.   The only time I had run into a slight problem was the Green Tea Cheesecake. It was either overbaked or something went really wrong with it, because it was as if the cheese was separating. I'm not sure if that can even happen, but it was crumbing everywhere and somewhat tasted burnt? But i'll let it slide, cause every other time I've been here I never had a problem.  Two reasons why I will always come back to Guu - the awesome food and the atmosphere. Like many reviewers have said, its a fun, loud and different. Guu isn't just about food."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places in Toronto. Came with a party of 8 for a birthday dinner Saturday night (made a reservation through Yelp) and had an AMAZING time. The food is great, service fantastic, but vibrant energy of the place is what really makes it 5 stars!! The entire staff greets you with loud yells when you come, and I highly recommend you do sake bombs bc the server will yell sake and you yell bombs and it's just so fun. They also took a Polaroid of us for the birthday, and had a sign saying happy birthday to the birthday boy! Really just such an awesome fun vibe.   Food wise you really can't go wrong with anything.. my personal favorites are the salmon tataki, unagi rice, and fried Brie haha. But truly, everything is so delicious! They are small plates meant for sharing, so perfect for trying lots of different new items :)"}
{"text":"Wow-wee! This place is yummy but loud! You can barely hold a conversation here. It's best if you go with 2 or more people since most of their dishes can be shared. If you're lucky, you can grab a patio seat. Whenever you come in, you're greeted by the staff, which can get annoying once you're eating. Everything on their menus is good, so fear not and just explore your culinary senses. Pro-tip: Don't bother calling as they don't take reservations. Pro-tip 2: Go early, because lines can take up to 1-2 hours! Yikes. Come when it opens to guarantee a spot."}
{"text":"My girl insisted she take me here on one of my Toronto visits that I felt inclined to go since she kept raving how good it was. We got there close to 9pm, still a LINE out the door and it wasn't only until another half hour that we got in.  Once in, I can tell the place is pure Japanese, from the decor to the chefs. Awesome. Not to mention the way all the workers yell out to greet you. Oh heyyyy!  We got seated outside so I didn't get to experience the inner-restaurant vibe. But, that's okay! It was in the beginning of October anyways, perfect temp with fresh night air. We were then seated ans greeted by our waitress, who was also super friendly and helpful. Mind SO curious with what's all the hype about, my girl and her boyfriend started ordering an array of dishes for a first timer like me.. From what I remember, there was beef sashimi, tuna sashimi, japanese bibimbap, oysters.. yum yum yum!  I was pretty impressed at how delicious everything was, with perfect texture and display. I don't think there was one dish that i disliked! The environment was also incredibly warming and it looks like everyone there was just having a good ol' time. Definitely will be back the next time I'm in Toronto and this time, hopefully I'll get to experience sitting inside!"}
{"text":"Great ambience and excellent service. Food is good and reasone price. I will go there again and hope they will offer teriyaky."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to grab food! Only downfall is  it can get expensive as the portions are small and you'll want to keep ordering more   Top picks include: baked oysters and the beef cold dish  The downtown locations have a great vibe during dinner times, loud but very chill!"}
{"text":"Guu is the best izakaya in town. There is nothing bad about this place, except maybe the wait but that's understandable. The staff is amazing and the food is even more so.   My favorites are:  Kinoko Bibimbap  Deep Fried Brie Kabocha Korokke Takoyaki  Gyu Carpaccio  Gyu Shabu Salad Ikapiri Kurage Kimchi & Carbonara Udon  Tip: The quiet side is where you take off your shoes. It gets quite loud on the other side."}
{"text":"I love the effort they put in when they greet you at the door. It makes you feel like you are a special guest. The jellyfish is delicious and it reminiscent of Enokitake mushrooms texture wise and the sweetness is on point. The rice dish with onions, beef, and poached egg were delicious. The beef however was a little dry but it was packed with flavours of savoury sweet goodness. The poached egg when penetrated, oozes out perfectly onto the hot rice. Very nice."}
{"text":"The place is really loud and fun, that's what an Izakaya is, it's a place for friends to go have for drinks and have tasty side dishes to go with the alcohol and the company. Like a tapas bar.  My first experience there was not so great as I was craving and expecting your normal sushi choices. I didn't know what an Izakaya was and my craving was not satisfied.  But on my second visit, I knew what to expect and every dish we ordered did not disappoint. The menu is not the standard stuff you'd get at any Japanese restaurant. Don't be afraid to try anything and everything on the menu, even things that sound like they don't go well with each other, you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"WARNING: Do not come here if you are starving and want to eat immediately.   There were five of us Yelpers on this particular evening. At 6:30, upon walking in the door...oh wait we couldn't. The restaurant was so packed we got stuck at the door trying to get in. People were lining the walls just waiting for a seat. We got our name on the list and slid down a wall as directed by the hostess.   After waiting for about 20 minutes and noticing that not a single table had turned over we decided to ask how long the wait would be. We were told it would only be a mere 2 hours! There were two groups of 9 ahead of us so we left and went for a beer while the clock ticked away.   When returning at 8:00 we found our table was ready for us. Good thing we decided not to have another round or we would have missed our table. as we sat down we were greeted with a friendly yelling of something in Japanese from the entire kitchen staff.   We left the ordering up to Susan C. and Mr. Susan C. since the rest of us had no experience with dining at this style of Japanese restaurant. We also ordered liter size mugs of Sapporo.   The beer took forever to get to our table, but what took even longer was the round of water we ordered. We had our first dish of scallops before the water came. On a side note, we realized later that the scallops weren't meant for our table as we got a second order of them during our meal.   The food came relatively quickly after our beers arrived. There was a good many dishes so I won't get into naming each, though this is mostly because I couldn't pronounce them in the first place. All of the dishes were quite excellent. My favorite was the pork bellies with boiled egg. What can I say, you can never go wrong with fatty meat.   To finish off this event of an evening we devoured the tempura banana a la mode.   As we left we were again yelled at in a friendly manner by the kitchen staff with an indiscernible Japanese phrase.   Overall this place was an experience in itself which is worth checking out. The food is great, a solid 4 stars. what dropped down my rating was the service and the table location. Our table was located less than 3 feet from the door. As this is a busy place, people constantly coming and going makes for a less enjoyable experience when you are constantly being blasted with the cold winter air."}
{"text":"I ate fried oysters, deep fried soy sauce chicken, deep fried prawns, sashimi salad, & Negitoro. Chicken and oysters we the best. Great atmosphere and ambiance. Small sized tapas which were inexpensive and delicious."}
{"text":"Fun loud and good cheap food and drinks! It's a college area so expect college students. Love it and will be back again!!! Bigger than the izakaya that I've been in Japan but same level of loudness. Cool vibe and great service!!! Ppl visiting Toronto and you like food, try this place."}
{"text":"I hate the wait/line at Guu so minus one star. Service and food are great, restaurant is clean and the drinks are yummy. My favorite is the matcha green tea cocktail- it's like a hybrid of green tea ice cream/milk shake and green tea latte. So much nomssssss. Karaage is always crispy, tuna and salmon sashimi is fresh... I recommend trying the baked oysters- two giant oysters filled with cheese yummmmmmy. For dessert, everyone should share/try the $16 sundae. Good for big groups and pregaming! Fun fun fun. Come here early so you don't have to wait for too long!"}
{"text":"This restaurant had been on my list of musts for a while now and I finally had a chance to visit the former GUU Toronto last week, which is now renamed to Kinka Izyaka.  The name was changed due to the ending of a franchise agreement but nothing else has changed in terms of food, quality, and service.  In the Japanese culture 'Kinka' means golden flower and symbolizes happiness and an 'Izayaka' is a Japanese-style pub. The new name suits the establishment quite naturally as you can't help but be in a happy mood while dining at one of the most fun and lively restaurants in Toronto.  From the moment you walk into Kinka, you are greeted by all of the staff.  I'm not talking two petite ladies saying hello at the door,  I'm talking like 20 wait staff and cooks SHOUTING out to you the moment you open the door.  It's surprising if you're not expecting it,  but it helps to set the mood in terms of making you feel truly welcomed.  The worst thing I have experienced is walking into a restaurant where you're waiting around for 5 minutes for someone to notice your presence; it makes me want to leave immediately and find a new place.  Luckily at Kinka, the friendly vibes were felt throughout the entire meal.  In celebration of the new name change, I was invited to a tasting menu to try out some of the most popular items at Kinka.  The menu is sorted by  hot, cold, grilled and fried dishes that are meant to be shared.  Pints of Sapporo to start  CHERRY BLOSSOM - Peach liqueur, cassis liqueur, red wine, 7up - $7.20 NAMA GURE SOUR - Half grapefruit, vodka, soda - $6.80 GOMAAE - Blanched spinach with black sesame sauce - $4 GYU SHABU SALAD - Shabu-shabu beef on greens with black sesame dressing - $7.80 KARAAGE - Deep fried soy sauce marinated chicken with garlic mayo - $7.80 KAKIMAYO - Baked oyster with spinach, mushroom, garlic mayo and cheese - $8.50 KARUBI - Grilled salt and pepper beef short ribs with scallion sauce - $7.80 GINDARA - Grilled miso marinated black cod with yuzu miso sauce - $12.80 BUTA KIMCHI BIBIMBAP - Rice, ground pork, kimchi, vegetables & egg in a sizzling bowl - $9.30 ALMOND TOFU - World smoothest almond tofu - $4.30  My favourite dishes were the GYU SHABU SALAD, KARUBI and GINDARA. The black sesame dressing in the shabu salad was so incredibly tasty; I love anything with sesame flavour so I was very satisfied with this dish.  The beef was also very soft and marinated nicely. The Karubi was perfection! Who doesn't love grilled beef short ribs? These were full of so much flavour, I could have had this dish all to myself.  The Gindara was buttery and flaky as black cod usually is, but it has to be cooked well, and it certainly was at Kinka. The Executive Chef, Ippei Iwata, made himself available, coming around to the tables to talk to the customers.   We were even given a gift bag as we left full of awesome goodies! I had such a great experience at Kinka and can't wait to go back.  The bustling atmosphere is inviting and you may even feel like you're transported out of Toronto and into Japan! Although it's a busy spot, it is also quite versatile, making it a great option for a birthday gathering, date, work party, or just about any good reason you have to enjoy an exciting night out with good food and company!  Kinka Izayaka is now taking reservations at their three locations: http://www.kinkaizakaya.com/location/"}
{"text":"To start, Guu is a pretty cool concept. When you walk into the bunker-like building through the produce cooler plastic flap door, you will be greeted by the staff in Japanese. This happens every time someone enters or leaves.  I'm not a drinker, so I'm just reviewing the food here, and I was decidedly unimpressed. The drink list is quite impressive though, especially if you're in to sake.  The portions are small and expensive for what they are.   The octopus balls arrived piping hot, and were extremely salty. There were far too many competing flavours to be able to enjoy these  The beef tataki was wonderful- an expertly seared piece of beef, and a delicious ponzu with shredded vegetable  The yakisoba noodles arrived as a lukewarm, sticky flavourless mess, with only a few token shards of the promised beef and mushrooms  The mackerel was extremely greasy (and mackerel is an oily fish to begin with) and the garlic in the dish was burnt, giving everything the extremely bitter taste of burnt garlic. The dish was also extremely salty.  The staff were very friendly and attentive, and navigated the crowded dining room with ease. They also knew the menu and drink list very well  Overall, high marks for the ambiance, service and the beef tataki, everything else being a disappointment"}
{"text":"Fun spot to take out of towners or people visiting from small towns as they've likely never been to a place like this. Very loud, upbeat atmosphere. Attentive service and lots of great menu items that are exotic but still appealing to most Western palates. Although if you're very picky or expecting to get 'Canadianized' food- might be best to skip.  I always order the Deep Fried Brie served with a fruit sauce. I've never been here when it wasn't extremely busy and if you want privacy you probably won't get it due to community tables."}
{"text":"Warning- very loud. Expect random shouting from the moment you step in till the moment you leave.  Ordered the Salmon Natto Yukke. Waitress mixed it up upon serving and the rest of the ingredients somewhat masked the smell of the natto. For a salmon dish, there was literally only two (and if I'm being generous, three) cubes of salmon sashimi that when put together, the size of the iris of an eye. If you're not careful when eating this, spilling the mixture on your bare hands may result in a faint natto smell stuck on your hands. Dish was otherwise good, but most certainly not worth 9.50$ (IIRC). If you want to try natto, go to Manpuku.   On a high note, the Aloe High is quite refreshing. There's the fresh aloe taste with the bitterness of vodka. Comes with an unnecessarily large amount of ice cubes."}
{"text":"By now, you've probably heard of Guu Izakaya from a friend who says the food is awesome and the atmosphere is nothing short of electric. And you know what? It's true the food and the atmosphere alone bump it up to a 4 star restaurant automatically.  What really made this a 5-star rating for me were the little things. It's hard to find a restaurant that tailors the entire experience. Some things I noticed: - The servers treat you like friends and will never rush you to eat or leave - The food is only served to you when they notice you're close to done the previous dish (this is extremely hard to find at Asian restaurants, as they usually all come at once) - The way the food is presented is picture perfect. - Birthdays are actually well wished and the entire restaurant celebrates (they even dance and have random party stuff like birthday hats, masks, and noisemakers)  By no means am I a food connoisseur or picky about the foods I eat, but next time you go, you'll notice that everyone at Guu goes an extra mile to make the experience that much better.  Just awesome."}
{"text":"I love their limited time menu ! Their orginal stuff I've tried it all, it may seem like the selections are wide but theres only about 40 selections and you need to eat about 10 to get full!  The cocktails here is what keeps bringing me back. I love the asian inspired cocktail drinks ! I grew up loving Aloe Vera, but Aloe Vera + Vodka ?!?! I'M IN LOVE.  Regular Menu:  1. baked oysters :over rated. Anything baked with cheese is good, but not THAT good.   I prefer oysters raw. The baked ones have a stinky fish taste to it.   2. angus beef tongue : my all time fav in the whole menu. It might sound disgusting, I promise its not weird at all. The mix of crunchy, tender, juicy.... I'm drooling just thinking about it :D   3. Deep fried chicken : not as good as popeyes.   4. Beef ribs: it's not even marinated, just plain grilled. I can make it better myself at home with a jar of kbbq marinate. Quite disappointed.  Limited time menu:  1. pork cheek meat is by far my favourite item on the limited time menu! It's a meatier, fattier piece of bacon, crispy with a coating of sea salt. MUST TRY!  2. Seafood ceviche:  I've been to mexico to have real ceviche, but the Guu one is nothing close to it. It's a few peices of salmon, tuna and scallop sashimi topped with tomato sauce for 15$. Not worth it.   3. Sweet shrimp sashimi : It's a little slimy for those who never tried before. 5pcs for $6.80, the value is good compared to many other sushi restaurants.  The only thing that pissed me off is that the server told us it was last call at 8pm.. we were there for 2 hours but we've been consistently ordering food and drinks!! Our bill between the 2 of us were $100 in just 2 short hours and they still kicked us out.  they need to understand that they are running a bar, where people want to sit back to drink and relax. If they want to shoo people out then consider opening a food truck. ( -1 star)"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner, and it was a long queue. But it was quite convenient, we just leave our phone number and they text us when seats are ready. About 20 mins wait, we finally got into the restaurant.   We chose the tasting menu, there were 9 courses in total, $35/person. It includes Gyu Shabu salad, salmon tataki, okonomiyaki, ebimayo, karubi, kakimayo, karaage, buta kimchi bibimbap, and icecream. When the dishes coming, it seems their size are rather small, but they were actually enough for two people. And I'd say all of them are delicious.   I would recommend this place to my friends and will definitely come again in the future."}
{"text":"First experience there was really good. The entire staff immediately greets each and every customer by all yelling \"welcome\" and \"goodbye\" in Japanese! Staff and food were great however the only minor complaints were that it gets loud after all the greetings and the tea was not hot."}
{"text":"I am smart! I am so smart! I came to Guu Izakaya on a Monday night at 9 PM! There is no wait! We got seated right away at the bar.  This place is busy! This place is buzzing! This place is full of energy! I really enjoy the concept!  I like all the yelling and humming with languages I don't understand!  We ordered 4 dishes to share between 2 of us: deep fried octopus balls, deep fried chicken, grilled squid and cheese bibimbap. They are all tasty except for the deep fried chicken. The chicken was really oily and gross because they double fried them! I could only eat 1 piece...  The Sake Mojitos is really neat! I enjoy that (of course popping the GUU Original RAMUNE is so much fun!).. the other cocktails looks really interesting too!  We finish our meal off with a Wasabi Cheesecake. It is not too sweet and just have a hint of wasabi taste.. yummm.. the only complain it is too small.. not good to share with your friend!  I really enjoy seating at the bar watching the cooking, though afterwards I do smell like fried chicken!  Since there was no one else waiting for a table, no 2 hour seating limit was enforced.  Yes I will be back and enjoy more drinks and bar food with my friends! But definitely on a weekday. I would not have wait in line for 1 hour or 2 for this experience!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here while I was in town on business.   This place is fantastic! I loved the atmosphere, the food, the staff, everything!!!!   When I first saw the menus I thought that it was a little overpriced, however I after I had my first dish, it was worth every penny!!!!   The staff does a great job at keeping the \"electric\" like buzz of the energy in the restaurant rolling. My only regret was going alone. I would have loved to share that experience with a group of people.   The Sashimi salad was amazing, the fried oysters were incredible and the Bibimbap was so good I couldn't get a picture.  I hear that this is the same owners as Guu, which I will definitely have to visit now!"}
{"text":"I was in here for lunch a few weeks ago, at the former original location of Guu, the place that started the Izakaya trend in Toronto. It's lost a step since those days, but is still a reasonable lunch option for the area.  We split two donburi (rice bowls), one with sliced beef on top and one with fried chicken. The fried chicken one was pretty good, the beef one was fine. Overall, very average, similar to several other izakaya and ramen spots in the area."}
{"text":"Loved the food, loved the ambiance, loved the concept of this restaurant. We ordered the kabocha korokke, which was a deep dried pumpkin with an egg inside and so delicious I died, the kinoko bibimbap and the karubi. All of it was wonderful. The Japanese soda, Ramune, was a revelation to me. No other soda will ever taste as good now that I've had Ramune. I've also had the karrage from there, which is basically fried chicken. I'm not a huge fan of fried chicken in general so I thought it was alright. Definitely want to try the cheese cake next time. I'm a huge fan of green yea flavoured desserts so I'm pretty sure I'll love it.  Their food game is definitely strong"}
{"text":"Delicate Japanese food. All stuff will greet you warmly also in loud voice when you first come in. I was shocked when everyone almost \" yell\" me haha. Fun experience btw. Food was delicious but very small, like all Izakaya's food. Grilled eel with rice and ?????? never beat.  Recommend : P"}
{"text":"Guu is great. It's loud, it's fun, and for $30/person you can drink and be satisfied. There are many reviews so I will try to provide helpful tips:  - They take reservations online, and I'd make sure you do that regardless of the day as waiting times for walk-ins can be over an hour on any given night.   - I would highly suggest sitting at the bar if you're going as a couple, watching the cooks prepare food and the interaction with them is a lot more fun than the tables. (It is also easier to lean in and talk vs. yelling across a table)  - Speaking as someone who only ever orders the house sake, Guu's is way above par in taste at the price point ($20 for 300ml).   - The seating is uncomfortable with wooden stools and benches, plus there is not much leg room if you happen to be above average in height.   - Just to reiterate: IT'S LOUD. Your ears will hurt.  For the dishes, most of it is really good. I loved the seared tuna and salmon sashimi, the tuna tartare, octopus balls, sashimi salad, fried prawn, and of course the fried brie - all were delicious. The pork rice bowl was underwhelming, the mackerel was good but not outstanding in flavour, but the most disappointing dish I've had in my two visits was the bbq pork. The sauce was watery and flavourless, while the pork was really overcooked (super dry and chewy) and very fatty.    They are still doing the best/some of the best Izakaya in Toronto. You won't be disappointed in your experience here!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere. Not for people on their first date. You won't be able to hear yourselves talk!  Must try: pumpkin croquette (kabocha korokke), brie cheese, seared tuna (maguro tataki), baked oyster (kakimayo), and believe it or not, the rapini."}
{"text":"Ive been to Guu for many times now and it is definitely a return. Great restaurant for birthday events with a group of friends and your date. Get ready for mouth watering food and drinks! Prices are slightly higher though, but you won't regret the experience."}
{"text":"Very authentic Japanese food with a fun atmosphere. Try the fried Brie- it was awesome."}
{"text":"Guu Toronto, a nice place to be shouted at, Japanese Style! It is within their culture, to be loud and cheerful. You won't miss that part of the culture, the moment you walk in, you will be shouted at and the moment you exit. They will hi and bye you very openly. They also talk to each other loud, so if you are looking for a place to relax and chill out, don't bother going there unless you are deaf.   The food is made to be entertained and enjoyed, but not huge portions to make you feel full. The food is an art prepared for you and put in front of you. You may choose to eat it or let it go bad and eat something that is filling you. We decided to eat and enjoyed the taste as well as the art.  Full review (+Pictures): http://cdn.xplean.com/2015/01/guu-toronto-nice-place-to-be-shouted-at.html"}
{"text":"I lived in Japan for 5 years. I say this so that you can understand the weight of my words when I say that this is pretty damn close to an authentic Japanese Izakaya experience In Toronto.  But even more fun.   Staffed by actual Japanese It's was a fully refreshing experience to be able to speak and order all my favorite foods in Japanese. The Quality of service was every bit as good as anything i have ever had in the land of the rising sun and that's saying A LOT!   How does it compare to an Izakayas over sea? I would say that this is actually an authentic Japanese Izakaya beefed up on Canadian steroids! This place is a party! Loud, Friendly and Communal! It almost beats you over the head with how Japanese it is which in a way is very anti-Japanese. I realized this when i saw them sing a Happy Birthday song. something that I have never EVER seen in japan and frankly drives me up the wall for most north American restaurants.    The Food: This is the weak link in the Guu chain. though it is Japanese and is cooked by actual Japanese people these people are just kids here on a working holiday visa cooking from a menu that has shifted more and more to cater to Canadian tastes.   Now don't get my wrong. The food is still quite tasty, and the place is a hell of a lot of fun to go to with a group of friends! The bottom line is that Guu is super fun but you may have trouble hearing your date over everyone else having fun."}
{"text":"The best restaurant experience I've had in a really long time.  It was probably because I was reunited with my two great friends who I met in Korea. Or maybe it's because I was in Canada! Or maybe it's because their restroom had mouth wash with cups and a notebook for you to write in. Or maybe it's because our waitress had so much energy. Or maybe it's because we were seated next to this family from Ottawa and I got super excited because I just learned that Ottawa was Canada's capital. Or maybe it's because the food, each and every single thing we ordered, was freakin spectacular! Oh, and the huge beer mug. Yes.  Here's a replica of our receipt (I kept it for my scrapbook!):   Sapporo Big Mug 9.5 Gyu Shabu Salad 6 Salmon Tataki 6.8 Gyu Carpaccio 6.5 BBQ 6 Kaki Mayo 7.2 Kinoko Cheese Bibimbap 8.8 Kabocha Korokke 4.8 Gomaee 3.8  Total: 67.12 ARIGATOU GOZAIMASU!! Be careful!! Guuing is addictive.  Yes."}
{"text":"Delicious food and fun atmosphere. You have to be a bit adventurous as the menu is not typical.  The food and alcohol is also extremely reasonable. You can expect waits, but it is for good reason."}
{"text":"Great Japanese tapas with a little sushi thrown in for good measure. An inviting and entertaining wait staff is attentive but not overbearing. Make sure to check out the kitchen's daily specials. Close your eyes and you could be just off the Ginza"}
{"text":"Always fun, always loud and definitely tasty!  Went last night with a few friends and had a great time. We always like sitting at the bar so we can watch the cooks, but be warned: If you sit on the end, you get a lot of shouting in your ear as the servers communicate with the BOH.  We tend to order a lot of food between us; we probably ordered over 50% of the menu. For the most part, everything was awesome. I do feel that the gindara had gotten smaller since last time and the spicy tuna lacked its usual punch. But if that's the worst thing I can say, I'm still thrilled with the place. I know the boys LOVE their giant beers and I can never say no to the wonderful selection of sake.  It's a fun place, especially if you've never been to an Izakaya or aren't familiar with Japanese food beyond sushi. I think it's a great place to take people from out of town, as it's a pretty unique experience. But be prepared for lineups, noise and slight chaos (good thing Sakabar takes reservations!).  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was the best restaurant experience I can remember.  Two of my friends and I decided to grab dinner and one of my Japanese friends recommended we come here.  It took us a bit of time to find the place, having walked by it once because it was so nice looking.  When we finally came back and walked to the door I was in shock.  I honestly thought we were outside a club.  We knocked on the door and a greeter came out and notified us that it could be up to an hour before we could sit down but my friend assured me it was well worth the wait.  Outside they had heat lamps to keep us warm and every time someone came in or left the greeter would make an announcement and everyone in the place would partake in the welcoming or thanking of the person.  It was amazing and I couldn't wait to have my moment in the spotlight.  Within half an hour we were welcomed in and it was as good as I imagined.  The greeter announced our entry and everyone looked up and cheered.  Amazing!  Right when I walked in I was taken away by the atmosphere.  This place was like a tavern and two things really caught my attention  1)There are long common wooden tables where different groups of people are seated together to encourage conversation 2) The beer mugs were massive!  We got seated and quickly my Japanese friend ordered massive mugs of beer and picked out some dishes.  I was still in awe of the place that I did not even see which dishes he got, but every one of them was delicious and unique.  I liked it so much I asked him to order us everything on the menu but we only got a few more dishes and they were also terrific.  I strongly recommend this place for anyone who enjoys good food and a great social atmosphere along with it.  One of the best dinners of my life."}
{"text":"Omggg amazing!! First of all they play the best music (late 90's/early 2000's r&b YUS) & have the best energy - the waiters cheer the whole time. If you want a quiet dinner, this is not the place for you. Second, the food is AMAZING. I loved everything I ate, but my ABSOLUTE FAVE was the pork cheek"}
{"text":"This place is worth the wait!! We were there on a wednesday night and had to wait almost 2 hours for our table.... now keep in mind we were a group of 9 so small groups won't have to wait this long!!   The food is amazing! and if you're about to celebrate a birthday..this is the place to do it... not only does the staff sing 'happy birthday'...the chefs do too! it makes for a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Definitely has character. The entire staff yells something at you in Japanese as you enter and there is a very social party atmosphere. The food here is not what you would typically think is Japanese based on our white-washed interpretation of it. So unless you're prepared to try some new stuff, don't bother. I did try many new things and didn't love it but it was still good quality food and I'm sure that after a few visits I would start to develop a taste for it. Very tapas-style menu (order a few small things per person). Overall, pretty good."}
{"text":"Food is good except for the dry ramen!! Very salty like you are eating the ocean.   Waiters are attentive and restaurant always clean"}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place would have to be the serving style... if that makes any sense. What I mean by that is every dish is fairly inexpensive and it's the perfect serving size for two people. This gives you the opportunity to order more and try many different dishes without having to pay a fortune or be overwhelmed by too much food. The food itself was good too. I recommend the takoyaki balls, not so much the black cod though. The place is very loud and noisy with the waiters constantly screaming in Japanese, which makes for a fun environment and a good place for a group of friends to get together and eat and drink. With that being said, I definitely wouldn't consider it a first date night type of place, unless you want to be able to not hear the other person talk ha"}
{"text":"This is such a fun and lively place! My new favorite place to eat, drink and be merry!  I wouldn't advise bringing a large group here as they don't take reservations and waiting to be seated together could be a very long wait. Also going on a Friday or a weekend is not advisable, as there are often a line of people there who don't mind waiting for an hour or two. On a very cold night, there was a group of people that were willing to eat in the enclosed patio than to endure the wait. The patio is enclosed and heated, but was still very drafty and not the greatest place to dine. You know you are in for something good.  The food is great. I especially like the Salmon Natto Yukke, which is a salmon tatare mixed tableside with raw egg, natto, wonton and garlic chips. I love the mixture of textures and while I was hesitant about the natto, I actually like the subtle flavor. It is served with nori sheets where you wrap it up with.  Actually everything on their cold/raw menu is excellent, including the beef carpaccio and salmon tataki. The grilled mackerel is very good, be sure to order it earlier in your meal as it take a little longer to prepare. I also like the grilled black cod with miso, eventhough you see this dish in most Japanese restaurant, I could never get tired of the buttery soft sweet fish balanced with the mellow salty miso sauce.   The BBQ pork is similar to what you find in a Chinese restaurant, but not as tender and succulent. Definitely eat it with the freshly ground horseradish (not as green and hot as wasabi) served on the side, as it makes a big improvement.  I was surprised to see a number of dishes served with cheese, which is not very Asian and sounded odd. I didn't order them as someone in my group could not eat dairy, but I will be sure to try it next time.  While many Yelpers rave about the pumpkin croquette, I thought it was just okay. Other than the sweet pumkin layer, it lacks much flavour (could be more savoury) and wasn't crispy enough.  One good tip: if you are going here in the winter or on a cold night, be sure to wear a sweater or a warm layer, as the front half of the restaurant gets very chilly from the cold drafts coming in from the front door and the patio, especially with the hoards of people poking in constantly to guage the wait time."}
{"text":"What an amazing restaurant! Amazing atmosphere, good food, amazing service! Price is honestly a bit hefty, but I think the experience is good enough to justify!  Their sashimi is incredibly fresh and tasty. Every day, they write a new menu, and will feature the seasonal fish served that day. I highly recommend you check that list to find your favorite sashimi. The salmon sashimi in particular was great. The Yellowtail sashimi, after trying a few other places, is not on par. I distinctly remember the taste of their Uni sashimi - it's not good. I recommend ordering Uni as Nigiri, and I wouldn't recommend it here.   The oyster is a must try. Absolutely incredible taste, very juicy, cooked to perfection. Almost every appetizer on the menu is incredible, so try them all if you want.  The atmosphere is very fun! Everyone greets you when your party enters and leaves, and once in a while the entire crew will shout out in Japanese. My first visit so I found it really cool, but I could see it getting a bit too much eventually.  Great Japanese food on the higher end, recommended for everybody."}
{"text":"Food 4/5 - Interesting. Original. Worth it to try every thing  Service 5/5 - They greet you at the door and interact very actively. Good place for BD party and new fun experience. Very noisy place. Not for romantic dinner.  They have mouthwash in the washroom. 1.5 hour waiting list! Reservation at Must!  Price 4/5 - $60-$70 for two with alcohol.  Will be back for Active Fun  P.s. a little bit more and you will have food fight there! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food, it's a shame about the service. At first I thought I could call this place my new favorite restaurant. I had visited the one in Vancouver and it was amazing as well. But I went on a date there today, and the service was so bad it could not be ignored. My date got his meal 30 minutes after mine, the waiters didn't care, no one checked up on us. Requests for the cheque were completely ignored twice, we had to grab another waitress and tell her what was going on, finally she sorted it out. Horrible, horrible experience considering the amount you pay (all the A la carte items do add up). I LOVE the food but I would never go on another date here again because its not nice to get treated poorly, no matter how good the food is!"}
{"text":"Kinka Izakaya is a Japanese tapas restaurant. I think they were formally known as GUU, or at least things seem VERY similar to GUU. As expect, the place sells typical izakaya thing - most of which are deep fried meats, assortments of raw and cooked fish, and a small plethora of sake and beer. Would 100% come back, this place is awesome!  The moment you walk in, the whole restaurant is screaming at you welcoming you. Obviously if you don't want a loud place to dine at, this isn't for you! There is a 2 hour seating policy, mainly because it's super fun here. There are some tables, but there are several long benches you share with others.  Ordered: All good stuff,  Scallops Deep fried brie Karage fried chicken Fried seafood pancake Takiyaki fried octopus Wasabi squid - VERY SPICEY Bamboo of sake - quite a lot of booze Pitcher of Saporro"}
{"text":"Tapas style dining. Unique Japanese style vibe where all the employees shout things in unison with each other.  Particularly when guests arrive and leave. Some of the dishes were definitely large enough to eat alone as an entree, like the BBQ pork.  Don't go here if you like to dine in peace and quiet."}
{"text":"Always a treat to go. Great Atmosphere! Facility maybe a bit small."}
{"text":"Most of the stuff here is good so no recommendations are needed. Avoid the natto salmon though! Terrible stuff unless you really like natto. Service is good and rowdy as everyone here says. The wait can be long so get there early."}
{"text":"One of the most authentic izakaya experiences in Toronto, with food quality a cut above. Fantastic karaage, takoyaki and okonomiyaki. The last time we visited I had wanted to do the sake sampler but it turned out they were almost completely out of every sake brand. I'm pretty sure that was an usual situation for them."}
{"text":"Update: the restaurant has changed.  I have such great memories of every time I've been to GUU over the years. Perfect for meeting friends, dates, or for forcing your parents to try something that is out of their comfort zone and knowing it will win them over in spades. However, since it has changed into Kinka, the last two times I've been we're underwhelming. food tasted like it was made by a line cook. not as fresh, not as carefully prepared. With many good japanese izakays in the West end, I don't think I'll make the leap to Church anymore for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Has a really upbeat and energetic atmosphere.. they all greet you in Japanese when you walk in. Bf and I shared 4 plates and each got a drink and were both full afterwards. Everything we ordered was good! Salmon was tasty and fresh, chicken karaage was really juicy, and the mushroom cheese seaweed rice bowl was different but super yummy! Only downside was that it was super loud in there that it was sometimes hard to hear the other person talk."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic and has been one of our favourites for a long time. However they have changed their menu and took off many of the vegetarian/vegan choices. They used to have an entire vegan section marked but it's now gone. We go far less now because the choices are very limited that don't include meat or fish. If you have people in the party with dietary restrictions or picky eaters this isn't the best place for you. That being said we still go for the delicious and fresh food with fantastic service!"}
{"text":"Can we open one up in the States? Puh leaseeeeee! This place is so unreal, so ....addictive. My boyfriend and I were on vacation and discovered this gem of a restaurant nearby our hotel. So amazing we came here for dinner two nights in a row!  First off, the restaurant is very loud and boisterous but it's all part of the vibe - very energetic feel. Every server greets you in unison when you walk in the restaurant (as well as when you leave)!   The food is basically Japanese tapas - small plates to share at the table. Every single dish we tried were amazing! My favorite by far was the karaage and green tea creme brûlée! There are seasonal items that rotates on the menu - so it keeps it exciting!   There is a bar in the restaurant and they offer pretty neat cocktails made with Japanese items. My favorite was the lychee mojito and sake served in a bamboo bottle!   The service is unmistakable given how packed the restaurant is - kudos!   Would definitely come here over and over again next time im in town!!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite izakaya in Toronto. There are always a lot of ppl. I often enjoy dinner here with my friends. The servers are japanese. They are all very friendly and nice. I love their food and the atmosphere. Great place. I recommend here."}
{"text":"I sat at the sushi bar. The place is a little alarmingly loud at first but I enjoyed the energetic staff as they cheered everyone as they entered and left. Great food - I ordered a few of their daily sushi specials. I would come here again!"}
{"text":"This is a great novelty restaurant to take your out of town friends to. When my parents asked where I was taking them I told them, \"I'm taking you to a restaurant where people yell at you.\" My mom asks \"Why the hell would I pay people to yell at me while I eat, that's not very nice.\"  And yet, that's exactly what happens, and you enjoy it too. Right when you enter the door you're hit with a loud shout welcoming you hello and welcome in Japanese. Any time anyone leaves, the staff shout again their thank yous and come agains. They also yell for random reasons which I haven't quite understood yet.  It is loud and rambunctious and exciting. Not a great \"quiet nook\", but meant to portray the food-stall setting of Japan.  The style is tapas (small plates). There are party combo options (which I've never gone for). Anybody who posts the price range is from $11-30 must eat like a bird because every time I've come here, the bill is always $40+ (because you're suppose to eat until you're full right?).   It's Japanese fusion and contemporary Japanese. ALWAYS get the Kakimayo (if you like oysters). It's so rich and flavorful. Their takoyaki is also very very good. I've been here a total of 3 times (at this location) and the food is always good and very different from what you would get going to your local sushi restaurant so I do thoroughly enjoy the novelty of it whenever my wallet allows me."}
{"text":"Ambience itself deserves one of the stars. Otherwise food, portions, execution and creativity are mediocre. Menu has hardly changed since opening, but you can always expect a consistent and \"authentic\" experience each time you come."}
{"text":"Great experience, wonderful food and awesome venue. The noise level is very loud."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE BECAUSE EVERYONE SPEAKS CAPS LOCK!!! Honestly, one of the few truly original places with good interior and amazing food presentation. Especially giving how flooded Toronto is with faceless chains. Visitors seem happy (although I'm not sure if they're just scared of the waiters so they feel the pressure to smile). Whatever the reason is - keep going guys. I must also note the interior, I actually felt like an abandoned Japanese orphan thrown on the coast by Tsunami, who had to wonder across the country barefoot until she came across this fish shop that was kind enough to feed her. Yes, that's how hungry I was and yes, that's how authentic it feel inside. Big fat YES."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  Their sake bombs. It's a popular drink here! For $5 you get a shot of sake in a cup of beer. But not only that, you get to experience the fun part of having the whole restaurant get all revved up as you take this same bomb challenge. A waiter will yell sake and you yell bomb. After three instances of shouting back and forth, you rumble the table to have the sake shot drop into your beer before downing it in one go. Quite fun!  Their tapas style dishes are great too. I recommend the sashimi dishes here and the takoyaki too. You can see in my pictures what I had and I loved all the dishes I ordered!   The ambiance in this restaurant has always been loud and lively so if you're not up for that, this restaurant may not be the best choice for you. Many come here for a birthday celebration or celebrating something because the bigger your group, the more it is when you do a sake bomb.   The only thing I want to warn you is about the pace of the service. Because they are so busy, sometimes it will take a bit longer for them to get the food to you or they simply forgot about your beer order. So be patient and be prepared to follow up with a waiter on your order!!  LAST TIP?!  The bill can quickly add up because you want to try everything but a good rule of thumb is to order two dishes per person to start and then order more as you go along your meal! Enjoy the izakaya!!"}
{"text":"First of all i have abit high expectation for the food here. I ordered beef udon taste a bit disappointing. Cuz i have been japan for few times and literary they dont cook that salty. I like  oden taste exactly the same that i have tried in japan. Indoor is super loud though. Not sure i will be come back again."}
{"text":"Fun place to experience authentic Japanese food and dining experience. When you walk on the employees will all great you in Japanese and show you to your seat. They have community tables or bar seating. We sat at the bar to be closer to the action since they are preparing all the food behind the bar we sat at. The other bar is standard with drinks behind it. We ordered a few small plates and some saki and we couldn't have been happier. The food was fresh, flavorful, and some of the best raw fish I have ever eaten. Salmon tataki was especially lovely. They play old school hip hop and it just fits, the environment is loud and fun. Great place for really any occasion, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places in Toronto. I must warn you, very loud as you are greeted out loud by all staff and when leaving. Different variety of Japanese food that are very tasty. I find the portions to be quite small but really delicious."}
{"text":"Never knew exactly what I was getting into when I came here one night for dinner with some girlfriends. Getting greeted at the door by every person working there is amazing! Not a huge fan of the communal tables but not too bothered by it. The cocktails and food are fantastic and I was blown away! I would definitly visit Guu again and suggest it to any friends."}
{"text":"From Vancouver to Toronto, I am a huge fan of Guu Izakayas. Their foods are ah-may-zing as we all know it. It's always fresh and the menus are ever-changing with their daily special system.  However, coming from Vancouver with the experience of the original Guu Izakaya in Thurlow, I have  to say unfortunately Guu Toronto did not meet my expectation. Don't get me wrong, the foods were great and maybe I am just being over-picky like those fastidious food critics but my overall experience was good but not great. Comparatively, the prices were slightly higher and the portions were bit smaller, which was expected from my general experience in Toronto so far. The atmosphere was too crowded. I know Guu is known for shouting 'ih-rat-shai-ma-sei' (welcome) to all customers, but with that particular floor plan, the noise was too much. It was hard to make conversations.  Ironically though, despite all my complaints I will visit Guu Toronto again and again. Why? I love their food regardless."}
{"text":"Absolutely a fun environment. Food was amazing! Recommend getting the sakai bomb, they do a ritual and its just a great time with friends! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"absolutely loved everything about this restaurant. from the DJ blasting the best reggae tunes, to the welcoming feeling/yelling \"WELCOME!!\" you get when you step foot into Kinka. this place definitely will have my heart."}
{"text":"I remember the day when the Kaiju invaded my city. Monsters taller than Gojiya killing and crushing randomly without regard for life. But that didn't stop me from going to this Japanese restaurant. Wait let me stop you right there - Japanese people don't JUST eat sushi and ramen. In fact, shame on you for thinking that. What are you, racist? This place offers the OTHER Japanese cuisine. But don't expect salmon teriyaki or shrimp udon here. No here you'll get more of the creative stuff.   Pros: + very nice atmosphere! Like a hipster fusion Japanese.  + menu is best described as a modern spin on traditional Japanese cuisine.  + all the dishes here are really, really good. You'll be dying for more. In fact, it's probably in your best interest to just get the combos.  + I LOVE the tofu dessert. So fruity, light, and delicious. + the yelling out of orders, the new and hip pop music all come together to make you feel like you're in a Japanese seafood market joint.  Cons: - portions kind of small, but I am a fat American used to huge plates so excuse the F out of me.   Love it here."}
{"text":"Make a reservation!  I guess the number one rule is for all of the staff to greet guests as loudly as possible. They seem to care more about this than actually providing attentive service.  The bamboo sake was cool -- $25 for 750ml.  The food was all very regular."}
{"text":"This place is super fun and the food is yummy!  They are an energetic service, with shouted greetings and departures. It's an up-tempo, party like atmosphere.   The little dishes are each packed full of flavour, with both authentic and fushion dishes. Just take it slow, or you will end up eating too much..."}
{"text":"Guys - it's the best izakaya I've ever been to in canada. At your entry the staff will scream and greet you and as pretty much everyone that will come in after you. Place is loud mad cool and super authentic. You almost feel you are in Japan. Thanks to yelp I had discovered it!!!! Must go boys and girls"}
{"text":"Church and Carlton is home to affordable, tasty japanese food. Keep in mind, most if not all the food comes in small portions, and you really aren't coming here, staying inside and intending on having a conversation.  You can try the patio for that.    Everytime customers enter the place, the waiters and cooks welcome them with a very loud greeting.  When customers choose where they're sitting the staff announces that very loudly.  And, when customers are about to exit, the staff let's everyone know that too!     This place definitely has the positive energy going on. Love this place!  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I don't normally come to restaurants in this part of town, but my usual hotel in the financial district was booked, plus I've heard great things about it. Very friendly and casual atmosphere. The waiters, in true jap fashion, are constantly yelling out incompressible things. The spicy octopus appetizer is served with small pieces of seaweed that you need to scoop the octopus up with. It's very heavy on the wasabi... so it will clear your nasal passages guaranteed. The hamachi is a must, and the cabbage pancake is pretty good. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the black sesame pudding."}
{"text":"AMAZING! everything about this place was amazing! the food, atmosphere and the presentation! when you first enter, all the chefs behind the long bar table greet you with hoorahs. the dishes are appetizer sized so i was able to try everything with 4 others. i recommend the udon with fish eggs. also the first time i had sake with dinner and it was moonstone plum sake which the waitress recommended and it was really good, sweet kind of like a juice. im not a big fan of sake, but this one was good. i highly recommend this restaurant. expect to talk loudly. friendly friendly environment"}
{"text":"We came to Toronto for a day trip from the US, we chose this restaurant because of its set course. They did not disappoint! The portions were sized perfectly so that you have a few bites of each but you're filled at the end. The Tokyo night sky and peach mojito drink were not only pretty but really good as well. Everyone greets you loudly with classic Japanese style when you walk in and as you leave definitely an experience. Must try place in Toronto!!"}
{"text":"Very nice, loud, and comforting environment. I made a reservation and they hand wrote a postcard for me and put it on a table, like, are you kidding? I don't give a shit what your food is like at that point, 10/10 customer service. This is how you treat a girl. The food they offer is purely for conversation, not to be appreciated. Good place to just hang out."}
{"text":"Came on a rainy night and dodged the line completely. There was a mini line as we were leaving.  Guu really just met my expectations. Overall good and positive experience with a few good dishes. The takowasabi was good. And I enjoyed the uni, takoyaki, ebimayo, and agedashi tofu. Am not into the sashimi here, but the gyu carpaccio was by far the best."}
{"text":"Guu Izakaya (@GuuToronto) remain my fave izakaya in Toronto but I just realize that I never did a post on it . A lot of my friends find it way too noisy with all the Japanese shout-greetings but I find it adds to the ambiance of the place... it make it alive, a happy place for me  (^_^)  Ben's highschool friend came back over the long weekend from Ottawa and he was craving for Japanese food and Ben thought of Guu and who am I to argue... he loved it and said that he wish they have something like that back in Ottawa.  And of course we have to start with Bamboo Sake $19 and for that price, I was surprise at the quality and the size.   Takowasabi $3.8 ~ marinated octopus w/ wasabi stem ~ All you need to do is to wrap the octopus with the nori (dry seaweed)   Black Cod Taco $4.2 ~ w/ tartar & teriyaki sauce ~ It was a rather large taco w/ pieces of deep fried cod, wish the taco was smaller so that each person can have their own. We had to cut this into halves... There was also way too much sauce, especially the tartar sauce which overwhelmed the fish own flavor and was extremely messy to eat.   Karaage $6.8 ~ deep fried soy-sauce marinated chicken w/ garlic mayo ~ This is a must at any izakaya I think, perfect with beer or sake.... but thought this time's presentation was lacking sparingly spread on a square plate like that although it tasted really good.   Ikapiri $6.5 ~ deep fried calamari w/ spicy ketchup & wasabi mayo ~ Everything taste good with ketchup right?!? And it's spicy ketchup which is even better ;)   Kabocha Korokke $5 ~ deep fried kabocha pumpkin croquette w/a boiled egg inside ~ Our friends thumb posing for me?! lol!! Somehow I always love this presentation with the wooden knife stab into the croquette    Ebimayo $7.8 ~ deep fried prawn w/ spicy mayo   Tontoro $6.5 ~ pan fried pork cheek w/ salt & yuzu pepper  2nd Round, Guu'd Sake $20 for the 300ml bottle and our friend wanted it hot which I prefer not since it tends to ruin the sake flavor.   Gomaae $3.8 ~ blanched spinach w/ black sesame sauce   Takoyaki $5 ~ octopus balls w/ tonkatsu sauce & karashi mayo ~ This is one of the best takoyaki you can get in t.o. w/ a super creamy centre and at $5 it's a deal   Gyu Tongue $6.5 ~ grilled beef tongue w/ salt ~ This was slightly overdone for me, not as moist and melt in your mouth as it should be but love the touch of mustard on the side which brighten up the flavor.  Miso Gyoza Hot Pot $5.8   Hotate Carpaccio $6.8 ~hokkaido scallop sashimi w/ wasabi dressing   Okonomiyaki $6.8 ~ Japanese pancake w/squid, tonkatsu sauce & karashi mayo ~ Crispy outside and a super creamy inside.  Sapporo Pitcher $17.9   Verdict : ~  it as much as my first visit & coming here always put me in a good mood. ~ They started to take reservation, so no more long wait... all the more reason to come here more often."}
{"text":"With the recent opening of Guu Sakabar, we reasoned that people would flock to that new location instead. Turns out, our logic was flawed. The izakaya was just as busy as ever (and bustling with chaotic energy)! We ended up waiting for 2 hours before getting seated at the bar.  Loved  Uni: sea urchin sashimi, which I'm a big fan of. I loved that subtle hint of sweetness and the creamy texture of the sashimi.   Kabocha korokke: deep fried kabocha pumpkin croquette with a boiled egg inside. I would've loved this even more if the egg inside was only half-cooked. Surely, a runny egg yolk would take this creamy concoction to a whole new level!  Kakimayo: grilled oysters with spinach, garlic mayo and cheese on the top. This seemed particularly fantastic on that night, perhaps due to my long wait.  Kinoko cheese bibimbap: with garlic sautéed mushrooms, cheese and seaweed sauce. Hands down, one of my favourites of the night! Of course, I've had this before, but I just can't get over how the cheese elevates the bibimbap to a whole new level of deliciousness!   Unagi Doria: BBQ water eel on mixed mushroom, rice, and topped with cheese. Lesson of the day: add cheese to anything and it'll taste better, even if it doesn't make sense at all!   Good:  Enoki hotate bacon: Enoki mushroom and scallop wrapped in bacon with soy sauce and mustard mayo. This was another tasty treat. The meat had a lot of bold flavours, which was a nice contrast to the lightness of the soy sauce.   Won't re-order:  Gyu carpaccio: lightly seared marbled beef sashimi with wasabi mayo. I appreciate that the flavours were kept very clean and light, with a touch of creaminess from the mayo. However, I couldn't chew through the rare beef. The wasabi also didn't have a very strong presence.  Calpico and orange cheesecake: this daily cheesecake was, in truth, a little strange for me, because I don't like the use of orange in desserts very much (I only like eating the fruit as it is).  Verdict:   Delicious food all around. But next time, I shall wisely avoid weekend crowds at all costs."}
{"text":"Got the $40 set menu, and also birthday dessert for $21. Spent $185 for 3 people. The meal was fulfilling but the taste doesn't  quite meet my expectation. Especially for Karubi (beef short ribs), it was slightly over cooked and has a burned taste. The environment however was fantastic. I would say this place is good for celebration/ special event, but it's only worth to try once."}
{"text":"My go to Izakaya whenever I get the cravings. Nothing disappoints. Love my beef tataki! A great sake selection to go with the amazing tapas. A must visit for all Izakaya lovers"}
{"text":"Fried eel (4/5) - loved the matcha green tea salt dip, the fish was fried to perfection with a great breading.   Takoyaki (3.5/5) - the filling was quite good, but I didn't like how hard the outer shell was fried to be.  Ebi mayo (4/5)   Kimchi calamari (3.5/5)  Birthday dessert (5/5)  $3 Sake bomb was totally worth it! I loved how involved the entire staff got, it definitely made the atmosphere a lot more rowdier & fun!"}
{"text":"SOO GOOD!!   One of the top rated searched places i found before going to canada.   Got the gyu carpaccio and the ramen.   The carpaccio was delish! Loved the garlic chips and the sauce was nice and tangy. The ramen was super filling and all of the flavors were great. I also had my first cup of plum wine here and had that served on ice. So good! Now i have a strong preference of this over grape wine since it was strong but sweet with not much of an alcohol taste. I would def come back when i return to toronto!  For desert i got the almond tofu. Silky and sweet with strong almond flavors."}
{"text":"This is already one of my favorite restaurants in Toronto.  From the food to the over-the-top Japanese staff who make the dinner a spectacle; there isn't another experience like it in the city.  My favourite dishes are Takowasabi (very hot, flavourful wasabi and Octopus appetizer), the black cod-tacos (incredible), the Kakimaor (BC baked Oysters) and the banana baked tempura  for desert.  Put it with warm sake on a cold night and it is hard to do better.  It is very noisy, but is something to behold.  Not a place for intimate conversation.    The waits can be very long.  We were lucky and only waited about 10 minutes on a recent Saturday night (on Fridays and Saturdays they don't take reservations past 5pm)."}
{"text":"The Good: - most authentic japanese experience I've had in Toronto - delicious food: enjoyed all the dishes we ordered - giant mugs of draft Sapporo - fun, authentic atmosphere - 20 minute wait (!) for 4 of us arriving at 6:30pm on a Saturday night (anticipated a 90-120 minute wait outside, that's why we went so early...)  The Not-so-good: - Expected more than 1 Japanese beer on tap... - Were told we were at 'last-call' for food about 2 hours after we sat down; this was anticipated however there was NO line outside and empty tables inside.  I'm sure we could have asked for an exception from the manager, but I was prepared to eat and drink more...  Overall - excellent experience.  Really nice to see such an authentic restaurant experience in Toronto, since most attempts are often so middle of the road.  Can't wait to go back - still will be expecting a 2 hour wait and a 2 hour time limit :("}
{"text":"The food was great, I would have ordered more if my server would have returned to the table over all I'd say yumm!"}
{"text":"food: 3.5 service : 4.5 atmosphere: 4.5  not the best location, but a unique place. has unique (loud) atmosphere and unique type of service"}
{"text":"The atmosphere, to say the least, was amazing! Loved all the screaming and shouting in Japanese. Didn't understand a single word - but it's all good! You can feel the energy and excitement every time someone leaves or enters the venue. There were about fifteen people working, while the place can probably hold no more than fifty. The staff were all super nice. Great experience.   Now on to the negatives.. why didn't it get a four... or a five? Well, I wasn't too impressed with the quality of the food. I tried about fifteen different items. On one of the dishes, the garlic was burned. Once you burn garlic, it has a very potent bitter slap to it... This threw off the entire dish.   The Yellowtail Sashimi had a frozen taste to it.   The place doesn't take reservations. They open at five, so we showed up at five on the dot. They didn't let us in till about five past five. Usually I wouldn't complain about this - but when it's -15 outside - it got me started on the wrong foot, which was slightly distilled by the happy Japanese greeting we received by an orchestra of gitty staff upon arrival. The place filled up in less than thirty minutes. Be prepared to wait outside if you visit.   The one dish I absolutely loved - Okonomiyaki (deep fried Japanese pancake with squid, tonkatsu sauce, and karashi mayo). This is a great dish. I highly recommend you try it. If you look at it for more than five seconds, you can see the squid shards flopping as the heat dissipates through the succulent pancake."}
{"text":"Highlight: - Japanese street food served in tapas style - Most food portions good for sharing & really tasty. My favorites include: beef & salmon tataki, FRIED CHICKEN, pork belly BBQ, fried okra, takoyaki..and did I say FRIED CHICKEN?  - Great for group outings - very loud crowd inside (including the workers!)- but very entertaining to watch. - Very attentive and friendly service. Certainly very lively waiter/waittresses -  Price can be a little bit on the high side, especially when you keep ordering the food (it's sometimes hard to gage and keep track of what you ordered!) It is easy to lose track of the food here, since you may keep ordering food since they are in small portion and so addictive! Next thing you know, you are already $40+ down per person  Verdict: Very unique Japanese street food restaurant. Really tasty Japanese street food (tapas style) & drinks.Come here with a group of friends if you want to feel the experience! Avoid weekends if possible if you do not want a wait time. Avoid this place if you want a more quiet, relaxed eating experience.  Kinka Izakaya, I shall return next time I'm around.  Regards, A very happy visitor from NYC"}
{"text":"Was brought here by friends last night for birthday celebrations, and we had an amazing time.  Seating for 9 of us at 7 on a Thursday took less than 30 minutes...  They even agreed to call us so we could grab a beverage at a nearby pub.\  The food, everything we got (with the possible exception of one udon noodle dish) was AMAZING.  Ribs, pork, rice - all memorable and fantastic.    The energy in this place is great, with the pounding music and the staff constantly yelling Japanese phrases to everyone who enters and exits, it really feels like a party.  Well, it could have been that or the 1 litre steins of Sapporo ;)  All this for what worked out to be less than $40 per person including drinks and everyone left happy and satisfied!    Definitely going back."}
{"text":"The food was really good. Had the fried octopus balls (these were OK), bacon wrapped scallops/mushrooms (yum), honey pork (yum), BBQ short rib (yum!), and seared tuna with garlic chips (so so yum!).  I was trying to decide between a 3 and 4. The food was great, but the wait was not. Not sure if the food was worth the 40-minute wait. Service was OK-- I felt like we were ignored, but that could have been because they were super busy.  Points for the cubby in the bar stool to put your purse though!"}
{"text":"The food was good. Would recommend the bibimbap and the green tea cheese cake. Baked oyster was not bad, just a bit too salty for me. I also tried one of their cocktail it was tasty. Around $80 for two of us and honestly we was just half full so it was pricy. I have only 2 stars because of their service. We waited more than 45 minutes before we finally got our bibimbap on table, despite that during this time we urged the waitress like 3 times. We were so annoyed, sitting there for 45 minute with nothing on table."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I was here but I was just thinking about this place and how much I missed it when I visited Toronto. This was some of the best Japanese food I've had in my life. I remember I got a Ramen dish (I can't exactly remember what it was called) but it had pork in it and it was so good. Also the staff are super nice and the decor is awesome. If you aren't hitting this place up when you're in Toronto you're missing out!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a night out with friends - easy to share tapas are great for groups. Prepare to be embarassed on your birthday as the the entire Guu staff belts out a 'Happy Birthday' chant.  Food is just ok - a bit overpriced and portions are questionably small."}
{"text":"My boyfriend comes here just about every week, and I can honestly definitely see why! The food is absolutely amazing, and the staff are so incredibly welcoming and friendly! The entire atmosphere of the restaurant reminds me of the izakayas back in Japan. We came in a few hours before closing on a Saturday, and despite being super busy when we came in, we were seated promptly and were serviced right away. All the staff were extremely friendly and I really value great service so I feel that it cannot go unmentioned just how lovely the staff are!   We ordered the takoyaki, salmon avocado poke, karaage, BBQ pork belly, and banana tempura. I would order all again except the avocado poke unfortunately. As an absolute fanatic of avocado, I felt it was delicious but the only off-putting element was the cream cheese. Of course it does not ruin the entirety of the dish or my experience, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. All the food was absolutely AMAZING otherwise! Takoyaki and karaage were nice and hot and crispy, and the portion of BBQ pork belly was really big and generous, with the pork itself being really nice and juicy! The banana tempura is DELICIOUS and a great way to end the meal. Amazing food and amazing experience and I cannot wait to come back when I visit Toronto again!"}
{"text":"The food, the atmosphere, the staff! Nothing more can be said that hasn't already been said of this place. They deserve all the accolades!"}
{"text":"Consider decent for Japanese food within Toronto standard.  I had the special BC salmon belly sashimi which probably was the best amongst the 3 dishes I've ordered.  Miso Saba (mackerel) was tasty but slightly overcooked. Veggie deep fried gyoza was average.   Very friendly stuff and comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love being yelled at, or should I say greeted with a loud yell from 75 strangers, when you walk into a restaurant??  Yeah? Well then, Guu is for you!   Okay, but really, I'm not kidding.    I'll admit I've only been to Guu once.  Actually, it's probably the only time I'll go unless one of two things are happening: 1) I'm intoxicated upon arrival and 2) It's for a date I really don't want to have to talk to all that much.  Again, I'm not kidding.   If you're going to Guu you really need to be up for it. For me going here equals the adrenalin and excitement I need for when I'm going out for a girls night. It's just one of those really high energy places that really loud so you need to be in the right mind set.   As I mentioned you're greeted at the door by the whole restaurant yelling at you in Japanese \"WELCOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"  I've capitalized all the letters and used an excessive amount of exclamation marks in attempt to give you an idea of what to expect, but you won't really know unless you go here. It really is super loud in the place pretty much the whole time. This is why I say I'd suggest this as a date spot with someone you're not really into or don't have great conversation with because you actually won't have to listen to them if you go to Guu for dinner.  You can get away with smiling and nodding with a laugh or two throughout the meal and not actually have to listen to a word your date is saying. That's saying a lot now isn't it?  But beside the volume of the restaurant, the seating is communal. So they have 3 or 4 (I can't really remember because my party was sitting on the patio) long tables inside the restaurant with benches that everyone shares.  So if you're a party of  1, 2, 3 or 10 you'll all be sitting together.  I should mention though this place DOESN'T take reservations.  If you are a party of 10 I suggest unless you want to act like you're 14 again waiting in line to buy the newest Backstreet Boys CD then get there early.  By early I mean 4:30, 5pm ish. Again, I kid you not. If you have a party of 2 - 4 expect a wait of 30-45 minutes on an average night from 6pm onwards and on a busy night anywhere from an hour and a half to two hours.   Actually, I don't even understand how this place gets so busy.  Even if it's an off night for every other restaurant in the city this place is packed.   However, back to the seating. If you want to have an actual conversation with someone ask to sit on the patio, it will make your experience a better one. Trust me on this. The patio is also set up like inside but with smaller tables but you'll be sitting on benches that run the length of the patio. I should mention, don't think it's some great large patio it can seat approximately 20-23 people if I was going to make a guess.   The food.  I'm going to warn you now. Don't be thinking that you're going to Guu and going to have some amazing sushi, because it's NOT going to happen.  Actually, I'm pretty sure I didn't see one sushi roll anywhere in the place. It's actual Japanese like noodles, and different grilled and deep fried meals. One thing to remember is that these meals are made for sharing, not because it's a large portion but because you taste a little of this and a little of that and the next thing you know BAM! you're full. If I had to suggest one thing off the menu it would be the prawns. I can't remember what they were listed on the menu as but they were actually really good. That's really all I have to say about the food.   The bathroom situation. Well I didn't use it so I wouldn't know. Can't help you there, sorry.   Parking. Now here's something I can tell you a little bit about.  There's street parking and there's lot parking across the street from here. You can have your pick.   My last three words:  bring ear plugs."}
{"text":"We came around 6pm on a Friday. As soon as I walked in, this place reminded me of Guu. Even the specials menu had the same font as a Guu I've previously visited.   We started off with a pitcher of Sapporo and ordered a bunch of Japanese tapas, mostly fried.  takowasabi - marinated octopus w/ wasabi stem. the wasabi is incredibly intense, be careful of having too much in one bite unless you love that refreshing wasabi feeling. takoyaki  okonomiyaki Fried brie - for cheese lovers Scallops - not as good as the Guu in Vancouver since it was smaller and less flavorful. still good value imo. karaage deep fried calamari   Beer paired well with all the fried foods, so I'd highly recommend that. Had a festive time here with the good company, drinks, and food. 2 hour seating maximum in case you have too much fun."}
{"text":"After a long nap on a Friday evening, I was looking forward to some cozy Japanese food for dinner. We made a reservation for Kinka Izakaya a bit earlier, and luckily the restaurant was busy but not so packed that we didn't have to wait to be seated in this dimly lit, but boisterous little restaurant.  Immediately upon entering the venue, it was clear that the vibe was not unlike a real izakaya--a Japanese pub or tavern--you could find in Japan. The wooden decor, the dim lighting, and the small-plates style of serving all pointed to the same authentic vibe. The servers all greet you when you enter, say goodbye when you leave, and cheer when anyone in the restaurant orders a sake bomb. It's no question that it's all kinds of fun here!  My friends and I split a decent number of dishes, the most memorable I'll talk about here:  -Gyu Carpaccio: This seared sashimi featured ponzu, wasabi mayo, and garlic chips on top. The meat was tender and the sauce was a mix of rich and acidic, which was a nice balance to the meat. -Salmon Tataki: This is the seafood equivalent of the gyu carpaccio. The flavor profile of the sauces were quite similar, but the protein was simply different. Though to be honest, I prefer salmon simply because I like fish more than I like most meats. Regardless, both dishes were quite good and the fattiness of the meat was rich and balanced out well. -Karaage: This is your pretty classic Japanese fried chicken. The soy sauce marinade and the garlic mayo was a nice classic dish. -Gindara: The grilled miso black cod was surprisingly delicate and delicate in flavor. There were some bones in the dish which wasn't much of a problem, but it was definitely a more delicate dish than what we expected. In comparison to the saba (described below), I think my friends and I preferred the saba. -Saba: Yum! I personally love grilled mackerel. Kinka Izakaya does a great (classic) execution of this grilled fish with a bit of salt and lemon on a sizzling dish. The crispy/flaky dichotomy was well done and flavorful. -Tonpei Yaki: This egg dish with pan-fried pork, bean sprouts, and cabbage was similar to okonomiyaki. Though to be honest I didn't quite like how they rendered the pork (it was a bit fatty for me), but I still thought the dish and its sauces were executed well. -Unagi Doria: This eel over rice as a pretty classic take on an eel donburi. The eel was well done and tasted just as one would expect, but I was a big fan of the rice. The grains felt like they had a little bite to them like brown rice, but overall was flavorful in comparison to most steamed rices that unagi is often served on top of instead.  To finish all this off, we also split a matcha tiramisu. I'll say I quite appreciated the flavor of it in contrast to the traditional coffee/liqueur flavoring, since this felt a little earthier and lighter in comparison. Looks like it's a seasonal special though, so keep an eye out for it!  This meal was a wild night and the portions were perfectly sized. Despite getting to sample so much, I wasn't stuffed! Can't wait to come back here for a sampling of their other dishes, or even their gigantic katsu they serve on Wednesday nights. Guess I'll have to make another trip up to Toronto soon..."}
{"text":"Guu was the original izakaya restaurant in Toronto coming from Vancouver. I went there at the original location on church and McGill. Lined up for one hour. Food was good but very noisy and the long line deterred me from going back.  Then it changed name to kinka. I went there with some friends for dinner on a weeknight. There was no line and we set on the patio. I guess izakaya craze has died down in Toronto so no line is good.  Walking past the indoor part of the restaurant, it was still quite noisy but the patio is much nicer. You get your own table and it is not loud. Food was very good. Menu looked like Guu. I heard it is the same people but didn't want to pay licensing fee to keep the name. But no matter it is much nicer to be on the patio. I would go back for that but not so much sitting inside so only summer dining for me there"}
{"text":"This is a raucous, rowdy, lively restaurant that's fun to be at with friends (but probably not a good first date place).  The service is pretty good, the servers are constantly shouting things to hype up the atmosphere, and I wonder how they don't lose their voices! The seating is kind of cramped but it's part of the charm, I suppose.  As for the food...the presentation certainly is beautiful. Every dish is very pretty and if you sit at the bar, you can see a lot of them put together. But it's on the pricey side and to be perfectly honest, (and at the risk of losing all my Yelp cred) I prefer Yang's Kitchen up at Markham - when it comes to similar dishes, anyway.  The fried tofu was dipped in a gooey kind of batter - the parts that didn't touch liquid were nice and crisp but the parts that came into contact with liquid (which was essentially the whole bottom half, because it's served sitting in sauce) was really slimy and gooey. It was really weird.  I prefer the grilled eggplant at Yang's over the miso eggplant here because it's fully cooked, and the grilled flavour is more fragrant. The miso eggplant at Kinka tastes really basic, like something I could easily prepare together by mixing some miso, sake, and mirin together and throwing it in a pan with some eggplant.  The baked oysters were good, but nothing spectacular. Ditto the grilled cod - I feel that the grilled cod at Yang's tastes better because there's less skin, so there's more caramelized meat surface, and because the version at Kinka seems to have a lot more bones.   The mentaiko udon was nice but kind of overcooked and the flavour really wasn't that special.  This is a decent place - you probably won't have a bad meal here - but to me, it just doesn't live up to the hype and I feel that I can get better tasting food at a significantly lower prices elsewhere."}
{"text":"Jovial, good value, great staff - just a bit expensive and several things could be done a bit better, but I understand that with the volume they are moving, sometimes corners are cut. Would still suggest!"}
{"text":"Grandma alert! Grandma alert!  I remember back in 2010 when the Izakaya craze began sweeping Toronto. Guu was the first. Guu was the best. Guu was exciting with all of their yelling, bright lights and sweet sake cocktails.   Well I guess I've outgrown Guu, but I still recognize it as an above average dining experience. I love the fried tofu, and I'm a fan of their mushroom bibimbap. As for the ambiance, the pink and white paper flowers are adorable, but the yelling. My lord! The yelling! I know that it's fun, but if you've been there before and you want to have some audible conversations with your pals, it gets to be a bit much. A lot much."}
{"text":"This place is basically the exact same as Guu Sakabar, so I should just copy and paste my review but I won't.  The restaurant is very loud so it at sometimes can be very distracting from your conversation especially if you're more than 2 at the table but the food and atmosphere makes up for that plus it's a great experience. As with Guu Sakabar this place is a Japanese tapas style restaurant so you have a chance to taste many different meals in one evening. From what I have tried (and I have tried a lot) they really don't disappoint with anything but the black cod is especially good. All in all a great place and an experience you won't soon forget."}
{"text":"I finally got to try Guu last night. I came with a party of 7 and we were seated immediately just before 6pm. There wasn't any line up when we got there, but there was a bit of a line up when we came out. So if you want to go there on a weeknight, come before 6 and you'll be guaranteed to get a seat :)  Service: fun, friendly, prompt! All the waiters and waitresses were very polite and cheerful. Everybody seemed to enjoy what they're doing, which is great because nobody likes grumpy waiters! They're all Japanese, which I love, because most of the Japanese places in Toronto are owned by either Korean or Chinese. So yeah, 5/5 for service!  Food: AHHHHHMAZING. There were a few \"misses\" but overall, the food was fantastic. We ordered the KABOCHA KOROKKE (deep fried pumpkin), which was delish! KAKIMAYO (grilled oysters, 2 per serving) was out of this world. EBIMAYO (deep fried shrimps) was ok, but not amazing. HOTATE BUTTER (pan fried scallops) was beyond amazing, the meat was so soft and buttery, mmmm... I'm salivating right now :p Another dish was GINDARA (black cod), which was OMG I WISH THERE WAS MORE ON THE PLATE BECAUSE IT'S SOOO GOOD! We also tried one of their special dishes, I forgot what it's called, but it's got avocado and prawn in some sort of mayo sauce. DON'T ORDER THIS. It's basically an avocado cut into halves and they filled the area where the seed was located with 2 deep-fried prawns. I couldn't taste the prawn at all because it's mostly avocado :( We also ordered the YAKIUDON = great, filling dish. Don't get the ODEN UDON, it's average, borderline plain. The CHEESE BIBIMBAP was good too, but I prefer the YAKIUDON ;) And to complete our entrees, we ordered SALMON CHAZUKE. Again, this was an OK dish. You wouldn't miss anything if you didn't order this. For dessert, we tried the Banana Tempura (a miss) and the roasted green tea cheesecake (a hit).  PRICE: pricey, for the amount of food you get. I suggest you order something from the Rice & Noodle section to fill you up a bit (go for the YAKIUDON or CHEESE BIBIMBAP). We spent $210 (incl. tips) for the 7 of us, which came out to about $30/head. Keep in mind that we ordered 2 per dish, so we had 22 dishes in total. Not bad, huh? We were full and satisfied!  OVERALL EXPERIENCE: AMAZING! I would definitely go back and try the others I missed (like the beef tongue and pork cheek!)   To those who don't like the \"loudness\" the servers make (they shout in Japanese to welcome guests, to say goodbye, and they also sing the happy birthday song together when someone is celebrating his/her birthday at Guu), then don't eat there. It's a part of the Guu experience!"}
{"text":"Between the incredible high energy ambiance the incredible ala cart menu and awesome german style bench seating this place is an awesome fun date spot and also great for a party. Book agead it's packed!"}
{"text":"I have no research. I don't know what type of food this place serves, or what it is about, or why all the buzz.   What I do know is that I went on a tuesday night. A group of 7 of us [all asians] and 2 of the group was kind enough to wait the near 2 hour wait for a table of our size. [note: large groups are only allowed 2 hours stay... hence our two hour wait..]  And when I say our, I mean theirs. I only had to wait 20 minutes by the time I arrived.  What didn't we eat. with this group, and great small sizing [but enough on one plate to allow all 7 of us to at least try one bite] we order pretty much the whole menu plus drinks.  The atmosphere was open, chatter filled, electric, and a great time overall. I highly recommend it.  Good for a busy date. Good for groups! With 7 of us, plus we all had drinks, only came out to $40 per person!   A snap shot of what we ate.... Pork cheek - Ox tongue - Mackerel - Tofu - Beef udon - Hot butter bin something - Brie cheese with mango sauce and Deep fried. - Cheese cake - Sesame ice cream - Deep fried banana  Just go already."}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place, so decided to check it out with a couple friends. Now, to start off, I don't tend to go to Tapas, I usually trend towards the AYCE places, which most often than nought are not run by Japanese people. This place i can guarantee you, the employee's are 100% Japanese. My friends and I got there around 6, parking was literally right there and of course there was a lineup. Waited about 30mins and finally got a seat. Once you come in your greeted by everyone, your also seated with random people on a table or at the bar, if you manage to get a patio seat it's guaranteed that your going to have your own table. The atmosphere, the people and the service was pretty good. They seemed up beat and everything came in fairly quickly, food, drinks, service, etc. We ordered about 12 dishes, mix of cold meals, hot meals and such. Relatively in decent portions, price for each was around $5 to $8. My absolute favourite was the Aburi Salmon, best Salmon Sashimi I ever tasted. If your a chicken person the Kagare was pretty good too! They've also got an interesting lineup of deserts, Mojito cheese and sesame ice cream with sweet potato fries. All in all, it lived up to the hype and I'd recommend it for everyone. Just don't expect to get a table so fast."}
{"text":"Food was ok, they brought me my sashimi salad but forgot about my friends food and drink entirely even after being reminded, terrible service!!"}
{"text":"The staff are so boisterous, they all stop to greet you in Japanese when you arrive, I loved it! The venue is open concept and with a few long wooden tables and benches. It seemed like you might have to share a table if you were a small party but it's fun and you can watch the chefs cook in front of you. I tried the mojito beer and was very refreshing. I love how the menu is short and sweet, I always get overwhelmed with large menus but here I was able to try everything that caught my eye. The best was the spicy negitoro (spicy chopped B.C. tuna with scallion). It was served in a small bowl with about 5 slices of seaweed, basically make your own handroll. Next time I go I'll be ordering two!"}
{"text":"Yes!!!! I made it to the Toronto location! Ever since I had a first taste of Guu a couple of months ago in Vancouver, I couldn't wait to get my hands on more! One thing that stuck out in my mind of this location in comparison to the Vancouver one (on Thurlow) is the space! It's very spacious. Very nice!  The wait was 30 min as it was Sunday night, party of 2.  Here's the hit list- Gyu Shabu Salad Takoyaki Kabocha Korokke Gindara Yakiudon Tontoro Gyu Tongue Salmon Tataki Sake Mojito  Yuuummm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Check out my pics! http://what2eatz.blogspot.com/2011/09/guu-izakaya-toronto.html"}
{"text":"Fun environment with tasty food - what else could you need! I recommend calling ahead for a reservation, especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. It's quite lively inside but if you prefer a quieter atmosphere, I would recommend sitting outside. Get a sake bomb and prepare to be entertained. The food was really good - the takoyaki, black cod, bibimbap, oysters, and karaage are all great. The salmon tataki was alright - nothing extraordinary. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you are into trying new and different things in a loud environment, then Guu is the place for you.  Japanese style tapas that are fun to share, whether on a date, or with a group of people - the more the merrier!  My personal favourites are the pork cheeks, tuna tataki, and the giant pints of Sapporo."}
{"text":"An awesome, unique japanese joint.  The meal starts with the WHOLE restaurant staff greating you as you walk in.  I had a variety of sashimi dishes, the sashimi salad and the pork belly.  All were awesome.  This place serves tapas style, so grab a couple per person and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came for the Kinkalicious offer they had going on ($29 per person). The food was AMAZING and the lobster sashimi was beyond delicious. However, we were still hungry after the 7-course meal, so if you're willing to eat great food but not be fully filled, this is your place."}
{"text":"Love the food and people at Kinka (previously Guu). My faves are the deep fried brie cheese, baked oysters, takoyaki, okonomiyaki and maguro tataki. The chicken karaage is pretty good too. Expect shouting throughout your meal if you're going to have conversations with your company. It's very loud, especially the greetings. Tables are tiny so eat fast if you're like me and likes to order a crapload of things."}
{"text":"It's like someone literally took a restaurant from Japan, picked it up and moved it property, people, and all into Toronto. Food is great, atmosphere is great (if you like it loud), beer is great. No complaints after all the times i've been. Just make sure you get there early enough so you don't have to wait in line."}
{"text":"Saturday night around 7:30pm and there is a line up and clusters of groups standing outside on a cold winter evening. They don't take reservations and by the line up outside, I'm assuming this place must be good!  We go inside not really sure what to expect, a giant roar of welcomes and cheers erupts every time some enters/leaves. A male hostess immediately greets us, we request our table for two and he jots it down in his IPad and tells us it will be about an 1hr-1hr&half wait and they will send us a text when the table is ready. No waiting inside so we kill time by strolling through the giant loblaws down the road. We come back in an hr to see how much longer, he says were next and were moved to heated waiting area that's an enclosed back patio.  When our table is ready (just over an hr wait) we are seated at a table for two in the back of the restaurant. A lively vibe and good music playing, chattering voices makes for an upbeat fun atmosphere.  A very bubbly waitress comes over to greet us and goes over the specials and menus with us highlighting some favourites on the menu. We are totally ready to dig in and are ready to order after our drinks arrive.   Green Tea - Only costs a $1 plus unlimited refills it's a total steal! Even better is the taste! Nice deep roasted matcha flavour, best green tea ever!  Guu'd Sake - First time trying sake but it definitely won't be my last! One word WOW! One glass will do me good, two might knock me out. $7 for a martini glass full or $20 for the bottle... take your pick  Maguro Tataki - seared B.C tuna sashimi w/ ponzu sauce & garlic chips Perfectly seared, very flavourful, loved the crunchy garlic chips  Scallop & King oyster mushroom - pan fried bacon wrapped scallop & king oyster mushroom w/ soy sauce & karashi mayo Tender sweet scallops and crunchy salty bacon, perfect contrast of flavours and textures  Karaage - deep fried soy sauce marinated chicken w/ garlic mayo Like amplified chicken nuggets. Huge chunks of moist white chicken with a crispy exterior. Very yummy  Gindara - grilled black cod w/ saikyo & miso & white wine sauce Perfectly cooked buttery melt in your mouth with a crisp skin. Deliciousness!  Buta Kimchi Bibimbap - rice, ground pork, kimchi, assorted vegetables, & an egg in a sizzling stone bowl It came with a raw egg on top and the waitress scrambled it table side for us which was fun to watch. Very flavourful rice, the longer you let in sit in the sizzling bowl the egg coating crisps the rice with creates crunchy pieces which I really enjoyed.  Green Tea Ice Cream - yummy roasted green tea flavour, creamy and sweet A perfect finish to a fabulous meal!  Overall fantastic service despite being a packed house, waitresses constantly refilling water/tea ,clearing tables and dishes coming out in perfect timing. Food was not only presented beautifully but the flavours/textures were amazing! Paired with an upbeat welcoming atmosphere. I can definitely justify the one hour wait as it's a Must experience!"}
