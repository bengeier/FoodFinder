{"text":"Horrible service. The owner doesn't know what he is doing. Went in for a dermal and he completely messed it up. I've been there twice now but a young blonde helped me the first time and she did amazing, Didn't hurt and it looks spectacular. The second time i came in he said he's the best and no one can compare but in my opinion he just has a big ego. The blonde did it better but she no longer works there. So I'm never going back."}
{"text":"I've been here for some of my piercing. I only went for the $10 piercing deal on Wednesday. Let me tell you I should have learned from the first time.  I first got my industrial done here (long bar that goes between the top and bottom of ear) and the front lady or whatever she was did my piercing. I'm guessing I caught her at a bad time since it was around lunch time. I understand getting caught during lunch can be annoying but at lest be somewhat happy to see a customer. She was a b*tch! I was trying to joke around and lighten up the mood but no. She was so cold. I had seen industrials done before and I'm pretty sure she wasn't suppose to yank on my ear so hard. I'm sure she took her aggression out on me. Which isn't professional in ANY way!  Second piercing. I got this guy doing my tragus I think he's the owner or something. Very smug if I do say so myself. I distinctly remember that day because he was arguing with another customer while piercing me! From what I recall he wasn't going to pierce this guys daughter without a form of identification. Which is good but that's beside the point. While he was bickering with this man it's mid piercing. So I'm sitting there extremely awkward between these two men going back and forth while I can feel the blood inside my ear. Not only that what I had to go back several times because the jewelry would ALWAYS come out. Eventually I gave up and just found something to put in my ear. Never went back again and never will go again!   This place is unprofessional and wouldn't recommend. It's better to save up your money to go to a professional place and get the desired piercing. Trust me. You'll thank me."}
{"text":"Very detailed, professional and down to earth guy!!! Would definitely recommend and will return for further work!!!"}
{"text":"$5 piercings sounds like a good deal but sketchy at the same time.  Let's put it this way, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.  I got two piercings from this place and the first one was for my Tragus and the second on my cartilage.   **INFO: They pierce with a needle and then slide the piercing in. Once they are done, you bleed a lot for some reason which I've never seen piercings bleed so much before, (I've gotten my nose, belly, and cartilage at other places). Also, the piercing they use is a long piercing. So it hurts so much because it gets caught on things and I have to be extra careful not to lay or bump it, which is hard since it sticks out.   Staff wasn't too friendly, seems as if they just go to work to work, which I know a lot of people do but at least pretend.  And CASH ONLY, they will not give you your change and they will convince you to give the change as a Tip. I understand tipping is a nice gesture but tipping is earned not just given.   Unfortunately, even though it sounds like a great deal... I WILL NOT GO BACK. Rather pay $20-$40 somewhere else."}
{"text":"I got my first and Third Tattoo here. The first one was when I was 18 years old..They don't lie when they say 24 Hour, I was working late one night and wouldn't get off till' 10pm but I knew I wanted my tattoo so I set an appointment. Now for that kind of hour they are not open so you do need an appointment. It was myself and 3 of my girlfriends. It was my first tattoo you can tell I was still scared and unsure but I got over it once my girls started comforting me. The artist that did my tattoo, hmmm forgot the name now, but the shop was full of people (co-workers and family i'm assuming) it was not a big shop; So we sat on the only two couches that were there. The artist's wife was also there, she was the piercer, a little intimidating as well as everyone there Now that right there was NOT welcoming. He did an amazing job however, My dove was very detailed with color and it came out PERFECT! I was so happy! after we were done, I tipped the artist and gave him a little pat on the back hug and his wife TOTALLY freaked the F out....Wowww now that was an expirience. I mean it lacked professionalism.   She somewhat threatened me and till' this day I will not forget what she said, \"Your cool and everything but you better NEVER touch my man again\". WHOA! calm down lady, your man is talented but it's not like I was hitting on him he just made a beautiful piece of work on my back that's going to remain on me for the rest of my life, I was grateful for the fantastic work! My girls and I hurried to the car and as we were leaving and I pulled out of the parking spot, she started yelling at him..Crazy.  NOW, my third tattoo...My boyfriend has his own artist, but you need to make an appoinment months in advance (yes he's that good!) so I didn't know anywhere else to go to. I was with my best friend and we went to the shop. We both wanted to get script letters done, my was on my collar bone and she wanted to get an estimate of how much hers was going to cost. We went and while looking at fonts, ther printed and drew mine out, however when they told me it was going to be $40 for small letters of \"This too shall pass\" I was kind of getting iffy of whether I should of got it for that price. They quoted her the same thing...She didn't accept the price (smart girl) as we also have a friend who does tattoos, he would've probably had just done it for a small amount or free, but I was already there...When she said \"No\" they somewhat started to talk bad by saying, \"Oh why don't you want it\" \"Oh you can get it free? by how, huh?\" again...Not welcoming. We shouldve just left. However she did get a dermal done that day..Hmm and now that my tattoo is healed and probably a month old, I'd have to say I should've just waited and stopped coming here since my first visit.  -High prices -Unprofessional -Lack of respect  I'm sorry I wasted my money here."}
{"text":"After speaking with whomever on the phone, I've decided I will never even step foot in there. I get it's a tattoo shop but I feel there should at least be some form of professionalism when speaking to a potential customer. It's like they don't care to have clients."}
{"text":"I read some negative reviews regarding the service with this company but I pushed the reviews aside and decided to base it off of the positive reviews on work instead. After one phone call I ended up not doing business with this company.   I called a (585) area code and a man answered the phone, he stated the name of a business but was mumbling so much I could not understand him. So, I verified the business name with him and asked if he was accepting clients so close to the holidays, he said \"yeah...... mumble mumble\", I could not understand what he said after \"yeah\". Not wanting to be rude and ask him to repeat himself I simply said \"Can I make an appointment for later today please\", before I could even blink the rude man on the phone yells to me \"listen lady, you aren't answerin' any of my questions, why should I answer yours\", knowing I want to make an appt and pay him for a service he spoke to me like that! So I said \"I could not understand a word you were saying so I am very sorry but I changed my mind on wanting your services because that was very rude\" and I hung up on him.   Based on his customer service alone I would never allow this man near my body with a needle of any kind, I will not reccommend him simply because he is the rudest person I have spoken to."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend going to this place. For starters, it's pretty ghetto, & not in the best area. They have a $5 piercing/$10 dermals deal every Wednesday, which is what lead me to get my tongue pierced there. The place looked clean enough on the inside, but the owner was super blas√© about everything & seemed like he wanted to get me out of there asap (quick service is a good thing, but this seemed kind of rushed). I was given a form to fill out & write what piercing I desired, then was immediately taken to the \"piercing room\" where his little children were running amok! There was seriously a 6 or 7 year old girl & a young boy running around the place, yelling & interjecting loudly while who I presumed to be her dad was piercing me. Not very professional, if you ask me. The sanitation seemed minimalist, but sufficient I suppose. He wore fresh gloves, sprayed my tongue with mouthwash, used a sterile needle (though he didn't use clamps, which I didn't like), & clean jewelry. But I feel like for a piercing shop, they should be just a little more thorough about the sterilization process. HTC takes a half hour just to sterilize your jewelry alone; I was in & out of 24 Hour in maybe 5 minutes tops. AND the guy wasn't careful enough with piercing me, because halfway through, he had to readjust the position of the needle before poking it through the rest of the way, which SUCKED for a piercing that's supposed to be initially pretty much painless. It's nice that the service was cheap, & the jewelry was included in the price, but it's true; you really do get what you pay for. I will not be returning to this place for another service."}
{"text":"I loved dee he was nice and funny, My tattoo is uneven and out of the lines a little in one spot Not worth 80$ but oh well"}
{"text":"I went into 24 hour tattoo (the new chandler location) with my boyfriend, he had seen Paul before and was looking to get a new tattoo. I wanted to add to / fix what I already had(done elsewhere) -2 flowers on my hips, but was unsure of what to do. Paul listened to all my ideas and drew up some things for me. It came out perfect! 2 large gorgeous hibiscus flowers, filagree, stargazers etc. I got only the outline done (both of my sides) using the yelp deal I found. He even gave me a 70 dollar credit when I pussed out and had to stop lol!  Very professional, talented, accommodating and CLEAN. Loved the work on my boyfriend and I'm so excited to finish up my tattoo. There was a few people who came in asking about piercings and tattoos while I was there, Paul answered all their questions and helped them. He also Shook my hand and said thank you when I left!  He didn't try and get more money out of me and gave me lots of suggestions on ideas to make my tattoo look sick.   Point being, I was so happy with my service and would recommend him to anyone looking for great work, great ideas,   clean place and professionalism. Can't wait for my second session! :)"}
{"text":"I went into the shop on Wednesday for the $5 piercing and I can honestly say it was the worst experience of my life. When walking up to the window the woman wasn't friendly at all and seemed irritated when you asked a question. Apparently they ran out of straight piercings to pierce you with so they offer to pierce with a horseshoe piercing. I got a simple lobe piercing. while waiting it was extremely hot in the building and my friend noticed the thermostat was turned off-- there were around 15 people walking around the shop.  when I got called in for my piercings my piercer was nice to me, he lined up my piercings well before doing them. After getting pierced I thought it looked good from the front. I was happy with them! my friend backed out of getting her piercing and they kind of laughed at her and made her feel uncomfortable about it and I thought that was very unprofessional. you should never have to pressure a person into a piercing.  I got very hot and lightheaded after my piercings due to the temperature in the room. they sat me in front of a fan which was nice.  I payed $25 all together. $5 for each lobe, $5 for each piercing (because I paid to get a straight piercing.) and I tipped him $5. they had ran out of after care so I was kind of irritated that I had to go by another tattoo shop to buy some.  when I got home I saw that the back of my piercing was coming out of my conch on the right side. on the left side it is pierced far back but not through my conch. I'm absolutely in awe that he would let me walk out of there without saying something. this would never heal in a lifetime. it's pierced through over a quarter inch of my ear! I posted pictures of the holes after I took the piercing out. I've already taken them both out and it hasn't even been 12 hours since I got them. I would go back in and complain but I don't think they would even take the time to deal with me and they'd probably fight me on it-- based off of what I've read in other reviews. waste of my gas and time if you ask me.   side note- I heard him talking about how he buys all his jewelry at Walmart for the $5 piercings because the good jewelry is too expensive. and the \"good jewelry\" that I paid extra for is even bad quality, so I can't imagine what the cheap jewelry is like."}
{"text":"This place is A JOKE! I live very far from there. So I'd thought I'd call first to see if a piercer was in or not. Called at 3. Called at 4. Called at 5. Called at 6. Called at 7. Finally it's getting late(for me.) called at 8 and finally just said screw it, and drove there. Walked in. No piercer. \"Yeah you should have called first.\" Eff this place! Also it's in a very sketchy aera and nobody seemed like they were qualified to do any of their work. Also, not one single tattoo that's looked the least bit decent."}
{"text":"Story in short: after a good amount of drinks(good meaning a lot in case you didn't pick up on that) i decided i was ready to get that piercing i have been wanting/talking about for awhile now.  its amazing what alcohol can do to one's persistence and motivation. so it was about 1am, and like the eager little beaver i was, i was on the hunt for a 24 hr tattoo/piercing shop and found one. alcohol in my blood stream i believe is the reason i was able to take off the necessary article of clothing needed to get this specific piercing in front of a stranger, but even with the alcohol the guy made me feel very comfortable and he did a really good job and i was in and out in no time, also place was clean and sanitary ( can't forget that can we)  next morning: sore when i rolled over, remembered my new decoration i got, checked it out and sober i will still very pleased with the work.   verdict:i recommend this place if you happen to have one of these late night impulsive scenarios happen to you.  good talk."}
{"text":"I was told through word of mouth that they had $5 piercings on Wednesday's. Which I was so excited for because I really wanted my nose pierced but I didn't want to commit to paying $50. However, I went to this shop 2 weeks in a row to get pierced. The first time I came after work and they ran out even though we were told they had piercings till 8. The next week I came around 11:30 around my break because I wouldn't be able to make it after work. When I got there I was told I had to wait 30-45 minutes because the piercer didn't have paper towels and had to go get them. Mind you they start the $5 piercings at 11 am.  So what was he doing all morning? It was so unprofessional, you know you're going to be busy but you don't prepare till it's past the starting time? This was the 2nd time I was turned away and I will not be coming back. I'd rather pay the $50 and get it done somewhere else."}
{"text":"this place is quick, friendly and painless, I got 3 piercings and will most definitely be back at this location to get more. I love the way that it is set up and I can't wait to get back to get more ill post photos after I heal up"}
{"text":"Dee is fun and sunshine is the shit. I've got my cheat dermals, trags and my double nose ring here. All healed perfect and you can't beat the price. Yeah dee is a goof but he's fun and the shop isn't ran by the old owner anymore so quality has gone up. I have another artist for tattoos so I haven't gotten tattooed but I've seen some work dee has done, its decent. They are very sterile, all the jewelry that comes in they sterilize as soon as it comes in and they sterilize again before putting it in your skin."}
{"text":"Drove all the way over here for piercing around 11pm. Showed up and the dude inside was high out of his mind. Told me no one was around until tomorrow for a piercing. Then why do you have a 24 hour tattoo and PIERCING shop?! Told me I should have called before hand, which I did. Of course they didn't answer though. I guess it my fault for thinking a place like this would even be a little legit. Avoid at all costs. All the tattoos looked absolutely terrible as well. What a joke if an establishment."}
{"text":"I have been going here for the last 3 years & have had my piercings done . Amazing workers there & great  prices , bad location but if your from chandler then you know they are good    I have had my belly button , VCH & tongue done here , love them all to this very day & just got a new piercing last night Check them out for sure"}
