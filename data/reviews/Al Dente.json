{"text":"I decided to try Al Dente after getting one of those groupon vouchers, and let's just start by saying I was no impressed.  Even before getting to the restaurant, I was a bit lost finding the place, so I called the restaurant to ask for directions. I was greeted by an abrupt and rude lady. Aside from repeating the address she made no effort to help me navigate my way there. She sounded impatient and just wanted to hang up. Not the best first impression.   And the service on site wasn't much better. htere were about two servers on the floor, which at the time were sufficient becuase the restaurant was no where near capacity.   The server that was ultimately responsible for our table ended up being the same lady who \"helped\" me over the phone earlier. She had the same attitude while serving us and taking our orders. Very impatient and snappy.   Several food and drink items that we wanted to order were out of stock, and instead of making suggestions for something to order in place of it, she just stood there with her eyebrows raised expecting you to have already come up with an alternate order.   When I went to ask her about the difference between two different veal dishes, she said \"the sauce\" with no additional commentary. I thought to myself \"No kidding eh? I couldve read that off the menu.\" Definitely not the service I expected from a classy restaurant that it portrays to be.  Literally 5 mins after ordering, our food arrived. Three entrees and a basket of bread, all at the same time. Leads me to think everything is pre-prepared and was microwaved.  \"Grilled Veal\" ($24.95)-Grilled veal scallopini with roasted red peppers and mushrooms, with a red wine balsamic sauce: --minimal attempt of plate presentation --veal was cooked quite well, but the sauce it was swimming in ruined it --felt like I was drinking worchester sauce!  Papardelle\" ($23.95) -Wide shaped fettuccine with shrimps, scallops, baby spinach in a lobster brandy cream sauce: --the noodles were cooked perfectly al dente (no pun intended...)  --sauce had a good creamy consistency, but seafood wasn't the greatest quality  \"Bruchetta\" ($5.95)-Garlic bread topped with fresh tomatoes, pesto, olive oil, and baked with mozzarella cheese: --Somewhere in the middle of our dinner we decided to add an order of bruchetta because literally every single other table that was there did so --There is nothing too fancy about this dish, and quite frankly it tastes like bruchetta I would make at home, but it was simple and delicious.  Unfortunate to say, don't think I would ever come back here again. Even with those 50% off coupons. Sub-par food, and terrible terrible service."}
{"text":"My aunt took me there for my birthday. There were seven of us and we were impressed with the decor (table clothes, cloth napkins). However that is where it ended. Although the waitress and the service was good, the food was over priced and tasted pretty awful. She said the mushroom soup was very good and it tasted like mushrooms pur√©ed with water and no flavour. My aunt, uncle and mum ordered three different dishes (veal Parmesan , chicken and tomatoe pasta), all three dishes were drenched in tomatoe sauce and the veal tasted grizzly and actually smelled awful. My husband ordered beef Wellington and another cousin ordered Greek chicken, both came drenched in the same red sauce. I could go on and on. We had one orange juice. The bill came to 227 dollars before taxes. Totally NOT worth it. It was pretty bad. What a way to ruin a birthday. I would not go there."}
{"text":"I usually go here when i have a date. My experience at Al dente always been great with good quality food. I had shrimp cocktail, bottle of wine veal parmesan and seafood Linguine. Will visit here soon ."}
{"text":"Now an Indian restaurant, 39 Spices. Really really good in its new edition.  Specialty is \"Dum\", a low cooking style that produced a great, spicy result."}
{"text":"Not the best for the price. Service was excellent and great atmosphere. But the food itself was a bit lacking."}
{"text":"Service was very good , food was decent but the atmosphere is old school . They need a revamping , especially with folcos just across the street . I think I would prefer their food for take out not eat in. Also I found them to be on the expensive side"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  It was getting sort of late for dinner and we were looking for a place close by and since we were already at Ballys, we decided to give this place a shot. I had read a few bad reviews for it on Yelp, but decided to try it anyway. It turned out to be pretty good.  It is not the greatest food ever, but it was good enough.   I tried the 3 course meal for $19.99. Started with a Minestrone soup.  It was more like a navy bean soup, but it was very good. Second course was lasagna.  Not the best I've had, but far from the worst.  I enjoyed it and the portion was enough to get full and just enough to keep from getting stuffed. Third course was the Tiramisu.  Warning!!!: As others have mentioned, it is not your typical Tiramisu.  It is served in a cup and it is like a mousse.  It was pretty good.  I didn't care for it too much.  Waiter didn't even give us the option for gelatto, just brought the Tiramisu. Overall, the service was very good also.  The hostess was very nice and seated us right away.  Our drink orders were taken immediately and water was brought to us without asking.  Meal came out hot, in a timely manner. Dark atmosphere, but very fitting. The price was just right. I'll go back whenever I need a quick, cheap Italian fix."}
{"text":"Until this I hadn't been impressed by much of anything at Bally's. Since I was there for work, it was hard to break away for a decent meal. As the week came to a close some of us wanted a delicious, easy to get to meal, and Al Dente delivered. The restaurant was pretty empty for a Friday which had me worried, but the kitchen was on full steam.  I had a wonderfully flavored veggie and cheese tortellini in a soft creamy tomato sauce. At one point my friend asked if it would be wrong to lick the plate to get all the sauce from her salmon dish. She didn't go there but we all understood the dilemma! Our server was attentive and funny, and the meal was one of the best I had the entire week."}
{"text":"This is a decent, slightly higher-end (though still pretty casual) Italian restaurant. The service is attentive and the atmosphere is good.  In terms of the food, nothing has ever blown me away, but it's been generally good. I've always had some form of pasta, so I've played it pretty safe. The wine selection is decent, and there's a full bar.  I've never eaten outside here, but there is a nice little patio facing Main Street."}
{"text":"Oh my, this place is very close to being a 2 star, but their service is their saving grace.  We came in around 8pm and the restaurant is pretty empty, which is never a good sign but we decided to brave it anyway.  The first thing we saw is the $19.99 three course dinner in front of its door, which sound like a great bargain. We had a big party going (9 people) and after having a sub-par lunch at Wynn earlier, I walked in with no expectation. Since I ate a 1/2 pound burger for lunch and that burger was still digesting in my stomach, me and my fiancee decided to pass the $19.99 dinner and opt for just two appetizer/soup.   Here is a summary of our dining experience:  Decor: 3 Pretty \"Olive-Garden\"-ish decor, nothing special here.  Service: 5, a guy from our group snuck a bottle of orange rum into the restaurant and helped himself and the birthday boy in our group using the wine glass.  The waiter was pretty cool and did not apply the corkage fee. We gave extra tip just for that. :)  Food: 2, the $7 calamari that we ordered was really not that fresh and oonly come with six pieces. $8 jumo prawn is a decent size but only has three per order and was an over-kill with cheese. Our group on average thought the $19.99 three course menu were ok with average entree and nasty dessert (especially tiramisu, DO NOT GET!).   With zero-expectation and a cool waiter, our experience that night turned out OK, but I would not come back for purely for the food. On the bright side, you never really need to wait for the table for your average tasting food. :)"}
{"text":"I haven't had much to say in a while, and while I've had bad food recently this one takes the cake!   My husband and I chanced on this place due to a flat tire.  The outside and inside decor is cozy and inviting. Well that's it for the positives.   We both ordered the Cesar salad to start (7.25) it was a plate of lettuce with one piece of baguette crouton, mixed in what tasted like mayonnaise and a little bit of garlic. Honestly, the store bought kits tasted better!   Our waiter was preoccupied or something because he didn't bother to offer up today's specials. Also when I ordered sparkling water, he brought me a bottle of flat water. (5.50 btw!!)   For our entrees, I had the lasagna and my husband had the orange roughy.  The fish was a little on the salty side but a full entree.  The lasagna was well, what can I say?! It consisted of 3 lasagna noodles a little meat sauce and a heap of mozzarella cheese on the top. This rather flat looking pasta heap swam in the middle of a large pool of marinara sauce that was rather salty.  I'm not a big eater by most standards, even when eating for two and I had to eat another piece of bread to feel mildly satisfied!! Needless to say we didn't stay for dessert, I mean why prolong the agony.  We definitely will not be going back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place more, I really did. The location is nice (main street Markham) and the restaurant is quite nice. It's a large rustic-style room with plenty of tables. The server at our table was also a very polite and professional gentleman who was very patient with our large group of young adults. Unfortunately, the food really does not justify the price tag. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad at all. I actually quite like the flavour of all the dishes I tasted The grilled calamari was very, very good and it was the only thing I think that was at the right price point. However, for a $30 bowl of pasta, I really want something more. The food tasted like something I can get at a less upscale restaurant for half the price."}
{"text":"On the higher end of dinners, Al Dente is fairly large sized Italian restaurant, in a white building, pretty much directly across from Folco's Ristorante on Main Street Markham. The restaurant is fairly dark on the inside, the waiters were nice and served us well.  I got the Lasagna for my main and we shared a cr√®me brulee for dessert. The lasagna was pretty good, though I would rank it as slightly average quality in terms of Italian food. The cr√®me brulee was fairly average too. For a place that is looks on the higher class, has a price of a higher class, with excellent service, I was a tad bit disappointed in the food."}
{"text":"Wandering around Paris aimlessly might sound hopelessly romantic.  Unless you are in Vegas and are so hungry you want to stab someone in the eye.  Of course all the buffets and restaurants have lines longer than Fry's on black Friday morning.  I was furious.  For food.    We kept walking farther and farther until we reached Bally's.  Finally, we reached a dark hidden restaurant corner.  Steakhouse or pasta.  Steakhouse or pasta?  They both looked rather packed so we just took a shot in the dark.  Pasta - it looked classy and it was mostly full of crusty old people who looked like money bags and hair pieces.  The best part is that they were offering a prefix for $25.  A bunch of food (and a glass of wine) and we don't have to pay $15 just for a measly sammich like the rest of the Strip?  We were quickly seated and our waiter was pretty funny but also gangsterish.  I didn't know if I shouldn't laugh at his jokes or if I'd get stabbed if I didn't. Anyway,  I went with the starter of salad and opted for the angel hair pasta with white wine.  The other half went with the soup and the meat sauce rigatoni with red wine.  Both were good but didn't make a lasting impression.  Then a bowl of bread came out - this was definitely the hit of the night.  The whole large ensemble of cheesy rolls, crisp flatbread, and french bread were demolished.  Next, the starters came.  The salad was lightly tossed in vinagrette and the soup was tomatoey and quite finely pureed.    The pasta was definitely not 'al dente' but a little on the too soft side.  The angel hair marinara was pretty potent so if you have acid reflux problems, you'll want to steer clear.  The rigatoni was good but I felt like I've had better meat sauce pasta at home.    The dessert was better looking than it tasted and they ran out of the tiramisu which made me quite sad.  All in all, the ambiance made up for where the food was lacking and so did the service.  The food wasn't disgusting and if you're hungry, you'll definitely leave happy and full."}
{"text":"Decided to go here because the line for the Buffet at the Bellagio was super long. The prices are ok but the food was just meh. The portions of the pasta were decent. But over all i've been to better"}
{"text":"Where do I start?!? The sauce was very sour and all of their food is just drenched in it. I heard some reviewers mention that the food is frozen then reheated. I really wouldn't be surprised. I actually had my baby shower thrown for me at the restaurant 5 years ago. The service at the time was great, but I would compare it to Olive Garden or East Side Mario's and i'm not a fan of either of those places. I decided to give it another try recently and didn't see any improvement. There are too many Italian restaurants on Main now and they pretty much serve the same sub-par food. My fav is still in Garden Basket Plaza in the area when I am in the mood for Italian."}
{"text":"Al Dente was a bit inconsistent.  My whole evening I was tottering between rating it a 3 and a 4.  The service was attentive and yummy appetizers (order the mushroom) arrived promptly = 4.  Entrees take FOREVER and server's jokes are no longer funny = 3.  Generous portion of creamy pasta = 3.5.  Server forgets 1 order of dessert = 2.  When dessert arrives, it is heavenly (chocolate cake) = 4.  Prices are very reasonable for Vegas (~$12/13 for pastas) = 4.5.  So there you have it.  Wait, I really didn't like the dim lighting; maybe I should take off for that.  Oh what the heck, I felt classy and didn't have to pay up the nose for it.  I'll take that."}
{"text":"Al Dente has closed and signage has a new Indian Restaurant opening up soon."}
{"text":"The service was very slow, but friendly.  The decor was outdated.  They were running a prix fixe menu: One appetizer, one entree, on desert for $20.  We didn't like the options on the prix fixe so we went for the regular menu.  Let me start by saying the bread bowl was the best part of the meal.  Hot, fresh parmesan rolls, crispy parmesan cracker and a nice crusty bread.  The fried calamari was attractively presented and the sauce it was served with (on the side) was tasty.  However, it was a bit greasy, chewier than it should have been, and the tentacle sections were just fried blobs.  My wife had the shrimp scampi on pasta and I had the Rigatoni Alfredo with grilled chicken.  The size of both entree were \"Vegas Sized\".  Ridiculously Ginormous.  The shrimp was very large; probably the extra-large or jumbo size.  My wife said they were a bit over-cooked, but not badly over-cooked.  Her main problem was that there was so much lemon in the sauce that it overpowered everything else.  My rigatoni was well cooked, but the sauce had a taste of flour.  The \"grilled chicken\" was a joke; it was about 2 - 3 oz, and didn't taste grilled.  When you give someone a vat of pasta with a couple of strips of chicken buried in it it looks sad.  One of us had one glass of wine, one of us had iced tea.  Total bill $100."}
{"text":"I was so surprised to see the negative reviews of this place, after having just had such a good experience there!  I went with a bunch of friends from work. Some of the friends has heard that this place KNOWS their wine and ordered a bottle of chianti, which was great (and I'm not a huge wine drinker).  The ladies I was with ordered two caesar salads to share amongst the four of them and the waitress brought them out the salads already split on individual plates, garnished with a garlic bread crouton. I don't think the salads were anything special, but I find that caesar salads in general aren't, so peoples' complaints about them below seem largely unfounded.  I ordered the baked goat cheese appetizer...OMG it was SO good. Goat cheese and grilled veggies on top of a portobello mushroom cap, with some sort of sauce and with salad and shredded carrots and balsamic reduction....to DIE for.  For my main I ordered the Penne Gorgonzola, which was also fabulous! The members of my partied ordered the veal parmesan (but grilled veggies instead of the pasta), the salmon with a lobster brandy cream sauce, a NY striploin and fettucine and everyone loved their food. One woman I was with IS a chef, so I feel like that was saying something.  Now, since I didn't taste their dishes, I can only expand on my own. The sauce was to DIE for. Creamy, complex and delicious. The pairing of veggies with prosciutto and cheese was excellent. I would order that dish again in a heartbeat!  Since we were having a good time and the food had met our expectations, we went for it and ordered dessert (even though we were all stuffed). We all ordered the white chocolate creme br√ªl√©e, except one friend who ordered the tiramisu and were once again not disappointed. Our creme br√ªl√©es were crackly on the outside and creamy on the inside. Perfect! The tiramisu was apparently great, served very untraditionally in a large plate, with an indentation like a bowl in the middle.  I was also pleased to find out that they serve caffeine-free cappuccinos, so we all ordered those as well and it was served with a little almond biscotti and was great!  Altogether my meal came to $50 (tip included), which I think is more than I would spend on a normal dinner out, but not crazy. Also note though that I did not pay for the wine and did not order any other drinks. That would obviously have increased the price.   The restaurant atmosphere is nothing special, but I'm disenchanted with the trendy spaces and pretentiously presented food that isn't half as good, so this wasn't a concern for me. The restaurant was clean and comfy, but the furniture was a little on the older side (like the dining chairs you would see in your fussy grandmother's home) and fake paintings on the walls.     The service was excellent. Our waitress saw to our every need, answered all our questions and came over to chat and make sure we were happy and comfortable regularly.   So, was it perfect? Well as I said, the salad was probably just average and the atmosphere also just average, but those did not pose major problems. I would ultimately give this place 4-1/2, but since I can't and this leaned more to the good than anything remotely bad, it gets a 5! I would go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"If I could give them a zero I would. This was the worst restaurant on the Vegas Strip. I live in Vegas so I've had time to browse and make a lap b4 committing to a location. This was the worst of the worst. Olive garden gets 10 stars compared to this place. (& they are the mcdonald's of italian food) Anyway... we ordered the pre-fixe menu. Dear lord. where do i start? The salad was blah, but was still the highlight of the meal. sad. I played ti safe or so I thought, and ordered the chicken fetticine. BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD decision.  Let's just say I was sick for the rest of the night. and it wasnt from alcohol. They served FRIED chicken on top of the fetticine. Who the flip serves fried freakin chkn on pasta?? disgusting. it was burnt at that. crispy burnt chkn in a bowl of soupy fett. pasta. O i get sick just thinking of it again. Luckily I told the waiter before I left, nothing could save this meal. not event he kind beverage girl or the tentative waiter. The dessert was just as gross, which who could eat after that main course. I went strait to the hotel where things got ugly. I spit into a napkin the whole way walking from the paris hotel to where we parked at the Hooters hotel by the MGM. WE should have just eaten @ Dan Marino's, which oddly enough I do recommend."}
{"text":"I'm not much of an Italian cuisine diner, unless it's my brother's in-law's family's cooking.  Their food is to die for.  So, i always compared Italian food to theirs.  Al Dente can cook up a great meal - from the appetizer to the main courses.  Wine selection is also good as they don't just have the expensive wine.  I like the fact that it was a very romantic and high star restaurant but yet inexpensive.  I was very impressed at how patient they were with us since it took us a while to order.  I was with one other person and it was a good dating experience.  I chose a Raviolli dish and my date chose the spaghetti.  He always likes to compare spaghetti's and said that it was pretty good.  We also ordered this raw meat and I was a little apprehensive about eating it, but the appetizer was prepared very tastefully.  It was enjoyable.    I know I'd want to go back."}
{"text":"I went for lunch with my parents during a weekday afternoon. Service is excellent and great selection of lunch.  We ordered daily special vegetarian pizza which is the best I have ever had so far.  The crust is moist and crispy and even the side crust is perfectly done.  The pizza is a must try for sure."}
{"text":"Its pretty cheap italian food. $20 bucks for a 3 course meal which is good.  quality..not so much.  There was a romaine heart in my cesar salad which is a no-no...also, got more of the inner, light green part of the romaine.  the cesar dressing was a bit overpowering.  The lasagne was average..nothing outstanding at all.    HOWEVER, the service was very good.  Waiter was funny and the staff was all friendly and accomodating."}
{"text":"I have been to Al Dente Italian Restaurant for dinner more than a few times over the years. Al Dente is a good solid neighbourhood restaurant serving Authentic Italian food.   Decided to come for dinner on a weekday evening, the place practically empty aside for 2 other tables. Though there was only 1 waitress, the services was really attentive.   Caesar Salad ($7.25)  - just the right amount of dressing to coat the Romaine lettuce  - Homemade dressing has a great tangy garlic taste   Linguine Marinara ($22.95) 2.5 star  - Fresh linguine cooked Al Dente with a good bite and chew  - Mussels, Shrimps and Squid were quite tasty and plentiful  - I found the tomato white wine sauce a little salty for my taste but my boyfriend enjoyed that   Veal Osso buco ($24.95) 3.5 star  - Veal Shank was cooked perfectly, tender and soft ... more like a brisket  - the meat and wine sauce was rich with great flavours finished off with a dash of olive oil, a little on the saucy side but was delightful  - Risotto was cooked well with this creamy gooey texture, a comforting homey feel!   At the end of the meal, the Chef came out of the kitchen and asked how I enjoyed my Veal Ossobuco and I gave him the thumb up!  Please note there are always 50% off 2nd entrees, Groupon Deals and Entertainment Book deals for Al Dente..so keep your eyes if you want to come for dinner! Tonight I used one of the Group Buy coupons!"}
{"text":"Al Dente accomodated our group of 12 people, the food was great (I had the meat lasagna) and the garlic bread was awesome. Everyone agreed the garlic bread was the best they had ever had! Also the waiting staff uses those little metal crumb catchers when scraping the table cloth right in front of you, I thought that was cool...I would totally go eat here again when at Ballys!"}
