{"text":"Wow, this place was so good!! My parents and I stopped by around 11:15am on a Sunday for brunch and even though we were told the wait might be 45min-1 hr, we were seated in 30min. We all really liked our orders. Our server was very friendly and even the other workers that ran out the food were very accommodating. My dad got the jambalaya omelet ($11) which comes with Cajun home fries and toast... he loved the unique combo of jambalaya in an omelet and raved about the Cajun home fries. My mom got the cinnamon apple walnut French toast ($11) which also comes with home fries. She also loved her meal. I got the carminator ($12) and enjoyed it very much however the mixed veggies in it were cut into very large chunks that overpowered the other ingredients if you bit into the wrap the wrong way. Overall we had an awesome experience and delightful meal and will definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"They have really good menu options & the food was delicious. Best part is they don't serve alcohol but they allow you to BYOB. (Me & my friend thought it was cute that everyone has their own coffee mug). If you go, see Crystal. She was such a sweet and attentive server."}
{"text":"Man.. Breakfast places that are open on Sunday are ridiculous to find in Cleveland. With the help of yelp... We were able to locate this little gem and get a breakfast that hit the spot.   The menu wasn't overwhelming and the food was reminiscent of alot greasy spoons in Chicago. We both were happy with the food... Just wished our waitress was better.  I'm pretty sure she forgot we were there except when it was time to collect the bill. We had to chase her down for syrup, etc.. And overall just felt like we spent a lot of time waiting."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by the person my friend and I were staying with. It was good. I ate the biscuits and gravy. I only ate breakfast here but the price was reasonable and service was fine. Atmosphere was nice. Go ahead and try it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First thing... Grumpy's Cafe, out of all the restaurants we dined at on our all day foodie restaurant tour yesterday Saturday 17 2016. They had the BEST service! Five stars for their service an I hope they keep up the great work! No one matched their service and 2 others eateries were very good. No restaurant I have ever visited has come close to the breakfast experience i had there. I had their omelet called the Starkweather. Being a mushroom lover that was the omelet for me! It was HOT (temperature wise) and fresh. i requested some cheddar cheese with it because I hate American cheese. They didn't disappoint. The Chorizo sausage inside was a new type of sausage for me and I liked the flavor.   What a wonderful way to begin our Cleveland food tour with a great great breakfast at Grumpy's. There is a good reason why they were on the top of the list of best breakfast restaurants in Cleveland! Go to Grumpy's if you are a Clevelander or just visiting our fair city. My foodie friends and I who will be doing tours of all the restaurants we can in and very near the city of Cleveland will return for seconds and bring others to Grumpy's located in the artsy Tremont area of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Christmas Eve morning and first timer at Grumpy's. My server Kayla recommended the corned beef hash omelette.  Excellent choice. Good coffee too. Loved the Christmas mug! Will be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Let me start this off by first stating that my spouse and I love Grumpy's and visit regularly for breakfast.  We love breakfast, the food is always great and the pumpkin pancakes are my favorite.  We always have excellent service in the mornings.  I often will bring in clients later in the day around lunch time.  I have noticed a decline in service in the afternoons.  I would always order one of the specials for lunch but lately the specials have been repetitive and uninteresting.  I just cannot put my finger on it, but something is missing from Grumpy's.  It is not the same diner that we have grown to love over the years.   This is sad to me as Grumpy's was always a welcoming place."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and we were seated quickly.  Nice little restaurant, food was good and there was a lot of variety as opposed to another local highly rated breakfast place on Yelp.  Has parking so your not roaming around the neighborhood looking. A neighborhood gem frequented by the locals."}
{"text":"I'm always eager to try a new breakfast place. And knowing that this place has been there quite awhile and it appears a staple for the Tremont area, I was excited to visit for a Sunday morning quick breakfast with the fam.  To start, the decor was nice. Trendy, bright, they definitely get 4 stars for decor. But beyond that they disappoint. The service was lacking. After ordering and receiving our drinks, we were practically done with our meals before we saw our server again. Which meant that I had to go up and ask for another fork, and ran out of water and COFFEE for a pretty long time before we saw her.   So, the food, the main event. Disappointing. I had the veggie benedict. It was $8.99 so I'm expecting something pretty good. The potatoes were bland. They had a nice spice to them, but no salt! How can you taste the seasoning without salt people! The avocados with the bene were not ripe. And my husband's biscuits and sausage gravy tasted terrible. He said it was ok to him, but to me....tasted like dog food. We will not be going back, unless desperate."}
{"text":"First time visit. Pleasant servers,  comfortable atmosphere,  good food, and reasonable prices. Will definitely return. Also enjoy the artwork/photography on the walls, which are available for purchase."}
{"text":"The girls at the counter were really friendly and helpful.  I stopped by for a sandwich for a late lunch.  I looked over the menu & chose the chicken club sandwich with potatoe salad.  I was so excited that potatoe salad was offered as a side I couldn't wait to try it.  After paying 8.99 for it (wow) got home and the sandwich was pretty good, but the potatoe salad, yuk.  I was really upset about that.  It was like they took al dente red potatoes (they were underdone) and tossed them with sliced celery in a milky dressing.  Not good."}
{"text":"After running the A Christmas Story 5k, we were all starving. We were a party of 10 and my friend called ahead to let them know we were coming. Luckily, a party of 12 was a no-show and we got seated immediately. The staff are so amazingly friendly and accommodating on such a busy Saturday morning.  I ordered the veggie eggs benedict, which come with cajun potatoes. Being a Mexican, I love spicy food; so they do have a kick, but that's exactly how I like them. When we go back next year for the race, we'll be stopping by Grumpy's again.  Extra kudos to the wonderful gal that tended to our large party!"}
{"text":"I have been dining at Grumpy's since it was located on Literary. (Before the fire) I am never disappointed with the food or service. Saturday night I introduced two friends to Grumpy's who had never even heard of it. (Go figure)  They were delighted and impressed and vowed to return despite living in Mentor.  Great food reasonably priced.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Great food here. The best corned beef hash in town. My favorite breakfast place."}
{"text":"I am generally pretty critical with breakfast places, especially in Cleveland but I can honestly say this is the best breakfast I've had since I've been living here. Everything was cooked absolutely perfectly. The pancakes were probably the best I've ever had. The best part was the price though. It was as cheap as a Denny's with obviously much better food."}
{"text":"It's great breakfast hangover food! I would recommend getting any omelette. They have a great vibe inside, lots of wall art. Very local and would recommend visitors try it out. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The Cajun breakfast potatoes are my favorite, as well as the french toast. Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"We had a very good breakfast here. Easy parking. Good service. Good coffee. Had the Biscuits and Gravy. Very good. Wife had corned beef hash. Perfect bacon. Really the whole experience was very good. Go back for sure."}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast on our way to the Pro football Hall of fame.  Grumpy's is very warm and welcoming atmosphere.  I had eggs Benedict and was not disappointed.  The home fries are kicked up a notch with Cajun seasoning.  You will not be disappointed with this restaurant or Tremont district."}
{"text":"After hearing great things about this place I finally I went there for the first time this past weekend.  There was quite the crowd waiting to get seated which was slightly frustrating, but I think that's just indicative of how wonderful and popular this place is!  Once we got inside, the hostess was super friendly, the wait-staff was exceptional and efficient, and the food was FANTASTIC!  I'm definitely going back soon...no matter how long I have to wait to get a table!"}
{"text":"Waitress was great and really helped me find something to eat in a hurry because I only had about 30 minutes to grab something. A good diner experience that I would happily revisit."}
{"text":"YUM! a must do for a happy belly full of great breakfast food! This has become one of my favorite breakfast spots.  If you go on the weekend around brunch time you'll have to wait awhile but it's worth it!  If you are inpatient and solo or with one other person you can stalk the people at the bar and snag a seat there. I haven't had anything I didn't really enjoy here.  The walnut french toast is AMAZING and I love that you can add just one of them to your meal.  The chorizo breakfast burrito was awesome and huge, I could only eat half. LOVE that the coffee is served in unique mugs and they aren't just your standard white mugs."}
{"text":"Love this place! Visiting from out of town and was told about this sweet spot as the best breakfast in Cleveland. Did not disappoint! Love the Cajun fries and the eggs Benedict. The service was lightning speed and attentive and the food came out quickly and made to order. I ate here again the next day and will return as often as I can!"}
{"text":"I am not the biggiest fan of Grumpys, its a pretty typical breakfast restaurant in my opinion. If your in the treamont area for breakfast, spend a little extra money and go to luckys cafe instead."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The staff seemed a bit rushed and weren't very friendly, but the food made up for it. If you love seafood, you MUST try the seafood omelette, it was absolutely amazing!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast and I had the benedict. The ham was thick, which was nice since often you get a thin slice that gets lost. The hollandaise was okay, but I wish they hadn't put so much on there. It was still yummy though. And the cajun breakfast potatoes were really good. My whole family had a good experience and my kids loved it because of the name ;)"}
{"text":"Omg sooo good!  Truly was grumpy until I ate the all meat breakfast skillet and put pumpkin pancakes in my pie hole.  It's a new day! Eat here!   With any luck you may get the kind and attentive server with the Egyptian and irish tatz!"}
{"text":"We love it here! I've tried so many dishes over the last few years. We drive from the east side just to enjoy this restaurant. Some favorites... BREAKFAST TACOS, sweet potato pancakes (I order a side of one, ask nicely!), chorizo omelette, and meatloaf. We actually stopped by last year for the anti fish fry because of the flyer on the table and it was really good. We didn't expect such great food for dinner at our favorite breakfast stop! Cajun home fries are wonderful. I ask for them well done to get them a little crispier and eat them with a side of sour cream when I get the tacos. Yum!"}
{"text":"Grumpy's is a great local cafe for breakfast. We ordered the breakfast sandwich and breakfast skillet with chorizo. Both were very satisfying and were large portions.   We went on a Sunday at around noon. It was very chaotic with numerous patrons waiting for tables, but the hostess did a good job of managing the tables and we were seated within 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"Pumpkin pancakes were excellent, everything else (eggs, sausage, etc.) pretty standard. Stay away from the veggie eggs benedict -- they don't toast the English muffins, which is just weird, and the rest of the dish was bland."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast based on word of mouth and the food network best breakfast I ever ate. Total disappointment. The corn beef hash was OK, but nothing to write home about. The pancakes were heavy and gritty. Worst of all, I got the eggs Benedict. It came with a clear gelatinous liquid that was NOT hollandaise. I've had better at a military base. Service was substandard. Oh and flies. Lots of flies. Never going back."}
{"text":"I'll start with this - I had originally written a pretty long rant about my last experience with this place, but after much consideration I've decided to cut this down into a short (but definitely not sweet) version.  Next, I'll say I didn't want to have go with a 2-star rating but the experience I had about 2 weeks ago doesn't warrant much more.  To be honest, the food brought the rating up to where it's at.  After much consideration as to where to order take-out breakfast from, the fiancé and I decided on Grumpy's.  I'm wishing we wouldn't have.  Here's why:  1.  When I arrived at said location, and about 10+ minutes later than my estimated pickup time, I was barely greeted by the hostess and stood at the front counter for more than 5 minutes before anyone assisted me - while there was a girl standing right in front of me.  A simple \"hi, i'll be right with you\" would have been nice.    2.  Once someone assisted me and checked on my order I sat at the bar for another 10 minutes before I was informed that my takeout order was given to someone else.  They would have to remake our food.  Fine, no big deal.  What got me was the service I received after the mishap.  While waiting for my food, not once did someone say \"we're sorry for the inconvenience - it'll just be a bit while we re-make your order\".  Instead I got to sit there listening to three employees argue and bitch about the situation right in front of me for a good 5 or so minutes.    4.  The re-make ended up taking twice as long as the original order took.  I sat in Grumpy's for 45 minutes.  I'm not sure why I sat there that long - I should have cancelled my order and gone to McDonalds.  Oh wait, I know - they had already charged my credit card before they even checked on the order status.  And I didn't want to go through the hassle of trying to reverse the charge.  So I sat at the bar - I wasn't even asked if I would like a refill on my coffee.  5.  When the food finally came out, it was shoved at me like they were trying to get me out the door as fast as they could.  No apology, just annoyance - like it was my fault this happened.  Listen, I get it.  Your weekends are busy.  And it was unfortunate that this happened.  But I've also worked in the service industry and poor customer service shouldn't be an option, regardless of what day it is.  As for what you're probably waiting to hear about, the food was decent but not worth waiting around for 45 minutes for.  All in all, let's just say I won't be back for awhile."}
{"text":"BEST BREAKFAST EVER!!! I could eat there everyday. Service was fast and wonderful. Local art displayed all around you!"}
{"text":"Meh. Long wait, unfriendly staff, and the food just isn't that great. It's not bad, but it's the kind of stuff that you could throw together in 15 minutes and probably be a lot better. Out of the 3 people that ordered over easy or poached eggs at my table, all the yolks were cooked all the way through."}
{"text":"Service great. Dinner okay. But I will prob give it another chance to try the breakfast."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love an old time breakfast place? This place is no exception. Be warned there has always been a long wait when I've gone here. On the weekend we have usually waited around 45 minutes. But once you get seated it is so worth it.  The food comes fast.  The sausage and gravy biscuits, walnut french toast and greek omelette are fantastic!!! Must try in Tremont!"}
{"text":"Consistent food and exceptional service!  Been eating there for year's no matter the server or the cook it is consistent. I highly recommend either Eggs Florentine, cinnamon apple walnut French toast, Literary Omelet or Jambalaya!     Update: had the opportunity to have dinner here tonight, the clambake. Absolutely the best bake in Cleveland.  Very glad it was suggested."}
{"text":"Yogurt, granola, fruit, & tea - nice, attentive staff - great start to a day! If i'm ever in cleveland again i look forward to being a regular. Dessert menu looked tempting, but not at 9 in the morning :)"}
{"text":"Good vibe quaint decor comfortable and has a special twist on the bfast or brunch dishes. The Cajun hf needed to be cooked more but the omelet was well filled. Good rye toast light not heavy bread seemed local bakery made supply. Busy so have to ask and stay on top of requests. When mentioned about hf not well done enough they quickly offered something else nice response."}
{"text":"Nope. I am not sure what I was expecting but nope.   I ordered a veggie wrap and could have made it myself. It was meh and with much cheese.  Apparently it is cajun but in my opinion confused [my family is from new orleans] and I wasnt impressed. Good service but food is fair."}
{"text":"Despite the mixed reviews we decided to try this place. We were visiting from Indiana and the restaurant at the hotel was less than imaginative. I couldn't stomach another breakfast there.  The food and atmosphere at Grumpy's was exactly what we were looking for. Service was prompt although I would have loved a drink refill sooner. I had the veggie Benedict and 1 side pumpkin pancake. Yummy. Hubby had the short stack blueberry pancakes and sausage. He also claimed it was delicious. He didn't care for the Cajun home fries but I thought they were good. All in all a great neighborhood breakfast place. Would definitely recommend to others."}
{"text":"Hi, I'm from New York. I was visiting Ohio on my road trip across the states. I stumbled across Grumpys through a Google search for \"Breakfast near me\".    Upon reaching my destination, I knew right away I couldn't have picked a better place.   I sat at the counter and immediately felt a sense of belonging. I felt as if everyone was friendly and I met a nice lady named Chris.  She spoke with me about my trip and than proceeded to introduced me to the owner Cathy. Very nice people.   I ordered blueberry pancakes day one and that was delicious! The second day I had to go again so I ordered a ham and cheese omelette.  The omelette was very \"Home Cooked\".  Loved it!  If your in tremont you must go here.    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The servers name for our last visit name was Shannon. What a difference a day makes! I came here today for breakfast with 3 friends and we happened to have Shamnon again. This time it was night and day. She was a bit on the rude today. Oh well. Servers are like everyone else. We have good days and we have bad days."}
{"text":"In town from Indiana and wanted to try Grumpy's since it got great reviews. All in all, my husband and I didn't think it measured up to the reviews. He got the Walker Hash and thought it had corned beef hash, which was wrong (not their fault). When he asked the waitress she just said that's not what that dish is about. The eggs on his meal were to be over easy, but they were close to hard since there was very little runny yolk. I got two eggs, crispy bacon, cajun potatoes & the French toast. All of mine was good, but I really wasn't a fan of the French toast. The atmosphere is very cute with a lot of dog pictures!!"}
{"text":"Was really excited to come and visit Grumpy's Cafe but our sever Helen made our experience a bad one. We were told we could not add tomatoes to an omelette and only saw her a few times which was to take our order and drop off our check. The food was pretty decent but the experience made it so we won't be back."}
{"text":"Dinner ????  I wouldn't do it ...    The special tuna was overcooked, the \"light cream\" sauce was reminiscent of mac and cheese and the cajun shrimp pasta, was 10$ buttered noodles with cajun spice and five frozen shrimp.  Our servers were nice pleasant and attentive, but strangely enough found it appropriate to vacuum the dining room around us (even though we arrived a full hour before closing)."}
{"text":"The visit wasn't anything special to say the least. Only a handful of people in the dining room, plenty of room and seats, server was prompt and attentive. Ordered the Grumpy Special for myself and pumpkin pancakes for the lady. Yes, the food is cheap and reasonable, however it seems the portion sizes reflected that in being lax. Really didn't get too much of the \"famous\" Cajun home fries for either of us. Bummer. The biscuit gravy was bland, but tolerable I guess. Pumpkin pancakes didn't blow either of us away either. Was glad to see and eat some local Jaworskis Meats, especially the bacon. Other than that everything was simply...OK...nothing that special to warrant another visit."}
{"text":"This is a great brunch option on the weekends. Apparently everyone in Cleveland thinks so too, cause the place was packed Sunday morning, but we were seated quickly in spite of it. They have a lot of great breakfast/lunch combinations, and unlike places like Bob Evans or Ihop, your eggs don't come to the table smelling raw like dirty dish water (Bob Evans is notorious for that). It was laid back, child friendly and affordable; perfect for a Sunday morning. The staff was friendly and helpful. The only thing they're missing are cappuccinos and crepes, but Im sure if they were to ever put them on the menu they would execute them as flawlessly as they did the stuffed french toast. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Lovee the food here! Got a big breakfast plate of potatoes and veggies with toast and loved every bit. Their iced chai lattes are delicious as well. Great place for a group of people looking to brunch on the weekend."}
{"text":"Great place! I had a really enjoyable and reasonably priced breakfast. It was super busy but didn't feel crowded, which often happens with breakfast places. They actually had a nice patio waiting area for those waiting for a table. Again it was nice because you don't feel like you're awkwardly waiting by the door. Staff and management were very friendly and attentive. I had a simple breakfast (eggs, toast, bacon) but it all was really good. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast! Worth the wait if there's a line. Pancakes are excellent. Four thumbs up"}
{"text":"Large portions of typical American breakfast foods. The service is pretty good, but by the end of your over-sized pancake you may find yourself thinking, \"I could make this on my own\". You wouldn't be wrong.   Bottom line: Big on quantity, quality is nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Got chocolate chip pancakes. Very yummy. Try the cajun homefries! So gooooood.  unique menu too."}
{"text":"Nice, cozy atmosphere. I had the eggs Benedict and it was delicious, the Cajun home fries were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning with my husband, my 1.5 year old daughter, my sister-in-law, and brother-in-law who were visiting from Atlanta.  The food was great, the servers were very friendly and attentive, and we loved the art on the walls.  I particularly loved the random collection of coffee mugs they use.  Makes you feel like you are sipping coffee at your kitchen table at home!  There is also outdoor patio seating and they have a very good sized parking lot so you don't have to struggle to find street parking.  A great experience, and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Lunch special half sandwich and soup was amazing for six bucks. Homemade chicken salad sando and tomato basil (thicker kind). Really solid meal and great service. You should probably stop by there. Today."}
{"text":"Cool little Cafe with super fast service.   We went on a busy Sunday morning and sat at the little counter, which was fun cause I could watch the kitchen staff do their thing! Staff was friendly and our food came out fast.  Sweet potato pancakes were interesting,  the maple bbq syrup was excellent!  All in all a great little gem."}
{"text":"i had been to grumpy's for dinner before, and hadn't yelped it because i didn't have the heart to give grumpy's a bad yelp.  i mean, grumpy's is a local favorite in tremont, from the time they were in the main drag of tremont to the new cafe on w14th.  i was underimpressed with dinner, but brunch?  yum.  i took my visiting friend from oregon to grumpy's for brunch yesterday before my personal tour of clevo.  grumpy's was great.  pumpkin pancakes and chocolate french toast.  yes.  chocolate french toast. with whipped cream.  and a sugar high, thank you.  they have normal less sugartastic brunch options as well, from egg combo's to meatloaf sandwiches. good stuff.  so i guess this is what i'll do- i'll split the start in what i thought at dinner with what i thought of brunch.  girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do."}
{"text":"The good: I'm a bacon snob on how I want it \"extra crispy\" and it was spot on and a good size.  The Cajun home fries are great just the right amount of spice and crunch. The portions were really good and filling The eh: asked for my eggs over easy more runny side but almost no yolk. Biscuits and sausage gravy while very tasty was cool almost like it was sitting waiting same with the toast. It wasn't busy at all was kinda let down. Will still go back again"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for a Grumpy's breakfast.  While I would give my Grumpy's Special with extra chorizo 4 stars for the very yummy (and unexpected) ground chorizo and Cajun home fries, I was disappointed with the pancakes my younger companions ordered.  The pumpkin spice and oatmeal apple tasted like a box mixes to me (I don't know if they are) and they were a bit too dense and cold upon arrival.  The coffee tasted like Maxwell House.  I enjoyed the funky art and the servers were efficient and pleasant.  Overall a nice breakfast but not somewhere I would go out of my way to attend in the future."}
{"text":"My favorite thing to do in a new city is just wander about until I find just the right place. You know it when you see it and it's a joy when you are correct.  That brings me to Grumpy's. It reminded me of home and it was on the way to our destination in Cleveland for our day visit.   Our breakfasts were WONDERFUL. They take pride in the food they serve and the ingredients were fresh and interesting. The  menu had a very Cajun feel to it and that was JUST FINE. My scramble with veggies and chorizo was SO DELICIOUS! Spicy and flavorful, exactly what I was looking for. Coffee was typical restaurant coffee, eventually someone will get this right. SIGH.  It was a slow weekday morning and our server perked up after a bit, no complaints. Next time I find  myself in Cleveland for breakfast I know where I will go."}
{"text":"Brunch is where it is at with this tiny place. I met a friend up on NYE Day and filled up on brunch food before a night out. My food was good and the prices are good for the portions. The waitress messed up our bill twice, but it wasn't a big deal because she corrected it quickly and apologized. I had been wanting to go here for awhile, so I was glad at the opportunity to finally go."}
{"text":"It's difficult to take a reviewer seriously when they are reporting on someone else's food.  Really?  Come ON, you're an adult!  Review your own food and service!      Sure, you walk in when there is a wait and tables have to be cleaned....the table fairy doesn't magically appear!  People are only HUMAN and cannot clean 6 tables at once if a couple of groups leave at the same time.  I agree with Brittany about the microwaved cheese on the nacho's...that needs to be improved.  However, texas caviar is much more than *just* beans.  There is onions, cilantro, etc.....it's really delicious.  Unfortunately, I think the handwritten tags on the art upset her and she was looking to complain.  The service isn't always great, but if a server doesn't come in for her shift, another server must pick up the slack...and it can mean slower service on a busy day.  I've been to Grumpy's 50 times and had poor service ONCE and I spoke up about it.  That's how you do it people!    I am in love with their spicy potatoes....HINT....spicy!"}
{"text":"You know what? I'm sort of sick of giving Grumpy's chances to \"get better.\" It's just not that good. Again, the pancakes were great. Despite my vow to myself to never have eggs there again, I tried the vegetarian Benedict -- poached eggs on an English muffin served with avocado and tomato. Should have been delicious, but had no taste! We ordered the hollandaise on the side, which really brought attention to the fact that the egg \"pile\" itself had zero seasoning. It was gross and I only took one bite.   We also ordered the apple-oatmeal pancakes, but were brought the buttermilk ones. The waitress was extremely apologetic about it, especially when we decided to just keep the buttermilk so we wouldn't have to wait any longer. She also deducted from the bill because the apple oatmeal are more expensive.   It also bugs me that I get charged for having fruit instead of home fries (which, as I've already mentioned, are not very good in my opinion).   Service is fine. Coffee is really good too. But I don't think I want to eat here again for awhile. They just don't seem to know how to season their savory food."}
{"text":"I feel disappointed that I have to give them 2 stars. I hadn't been here in over 3 years and I know that it is a local favorite so my brunch group decided to check it out. The food just wasn't as good as I remember it to be.   I ordered the Sweet Potato Pancakes. When the description states Maple BBQ Drizzle I didn't think it would be straight BBQ sauce. I didn't taste any maple and it tasted like it came straight from a store bought bottle. Other items that were ordered at my table were the Breakfast Burrito, Walker Hash and Walnut French Toast. We all thought most of the dishes were underwhelming but the saving grace was our wonderful server."}
{"text":"I have to be honest- I was underwhelmed by my whole experience here.  The service was not good and our server seemed annoyed and couldn't crack a smile if her life depended on it- is that why they call it Grumpy's? The menu is tired and uninspired dishes are average to below average.  The pancakes were very dry, with a texture that stuck to the top of my mouth.  Coffee was average at best.  I did like the display of local artwork hung throughout the restaurant.  There are too many good breakfast joints around that offer better food and service with a smile to make me return- but who knows, never say never."}
{"text":"Very nice cafe! Nachos were amazing. The decor was various canvas paintings for sale, done by an artist."}
{"text":"The hostess is pretty decent and extremely friendly.  Same goes for the food..   Me and a friend ordered porky omelet and egg skillet! Pretty awesome. Is a bit pricey..  But a good hangout spot for brunch!"}
{"text":"My GPS is rude.  When I ask it for breakfast it tries to take me to Denny's or McDonald's.  But I tried again while on our way out of Cleveland and was pleased to land at Grumpy's.    The service was good.  Both the server that helped us and the hostesses had a very laid back, conversational nature about them.    The food was outstanding.  I had the biscuits and gravy with spicy potatoes... yum!  Both had plenty of flavor, sort of hot sauce meets garlic, but were not overwhelmingly hot.  My partner had some sort omelet with Texas Caviar (bean salad) that he was very pleased with.    If there was anything I did not like it was the orange juice.  It was Minute Maid which is fine, but it's nice when a good breakfast place offers fresh squeezed juice.    Interesting decor - photos and paintings (all for sale) covered the walls.  Very casual place with a nice mix of just audible music."}
{"text":"All of the individual food items that I've had from Grumpy's have been delicious. The only thing that did not make sense is that the spiced potatoes are served with sweet breakfast items and savory breakfast items. They're very tasty, but don't make sense with sweet items."}
{"text":"After hearing a lot about Grumpy's Cafe in Tremont, and never making it there because I usually ended up at that other Tremont Brunch Joint - Lucky's Cafe, I finally made it out there over the past weekend.  And my first comment is that it really isn't a matter of Lucky's OR Grumpy's. Lucky's AND Grumpy's compliment each other perfectly.  Whereas Lucky's Cafe is excellent highbrow, customised brunch with a flair, Grumpy's serves up perfect renditions of the classic brunch. You will not find any Tofu Shipwreck dishes here. What you will find, however, are perfectly executed flapjacks, amazing Eggs Benedict, Heavenly French Toast, and Coffee served up by the large steaming mugful. All at half the price you've come to expect from Lucky's Cafe.  Brunch just got a hell of a lot better. :D"}
{"text":"The waitress was horrible.  She was rude and only came to our table 4 times.  After sitting 20 minutes with no help, we asked another worker for help.  She was at least nice and offered to refill my water.  No one was happy with the food.  I had the jambalaya with 2 shrimp in it and a piece of sausage about 1 1/2 inches long.  It was so spicy, you couldn't pick out any other flavors that are in cajun food, plus I had to water due to the bad waitress.  The food was dropped off and we never saw the waitress again till after we asked for the bill.  I was told the pancakes were dry and the western omelet was only so-so."}
{"text":"Nothing to see here. Unless you enjoy seeing primo breakfast foods and a friendly staff.   Reading some of the negative reviews is sad, but then one of these reviewers actually used the phrase \"at said location\" and wasn't being sarcastic. Probably heard the phrase on NPR and decided to give it a whirl. I'm guessing it's probably just someone who enjoys the sound of his/her own voice and sighing loudly in public instead of communicating his/her needs with other adults. These people are fun to watch at grocery check out lines as they wonder why things are taking so long at noon on a Sunday.   So anyway, we've been here several times for breakfast and dinner and have always had quality food and service. I'm annoyed that I have to drive from Brecksville to Tremont to get a decent breakfast. There is a Yours Truly nearby, but this place is worth the drive.   The sausage gravy + biscuits and poached eggs made me forget the rest of the breakfast menu. I'm sure the pancakes are good.   Nice place for a party too because they let you byob."}
{"text":"Went here last weekend. Its very... old people-y. I mean that its very much like someone's home. The menu is varied, but sparse. No booze, but you can bring your own.  I had the jambalaya, and i'm seconding Nicole's disappointment. Tasted like watered down tomato sauce with a few spices. Granted I'm not the hugest fan of cajun cooking to begin with, it was still bland. So I opted to sample the rest of the family's offerings.  The au gratin goat cheese potatoes were nice, creamy and tart. Mandarin glazed salmon was pleasant, but felt very un-salmon-y. The alfredo sauce was the perfect consistency and texture but lacked any flavor whatsoever.  The service was very good, but it just seems like a bit of a niche restaurant that I'll probably not like that much until I'm well into my 40's.  Overall it just seemed like a more homey TGI Fridays without any dud waitstaff."}
{"text":"I took my team there for a team meal and they were prompt, polite and so fun with our girls. The food is amazing and so is the atmosphere. If you want comfort food, \"feel\" good food or you just miss your moms cooking....this is your place! Thank you for the awesome experience!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped at Grumpy's for breakfast before heading back to Pittsburgh. It was a cold rainy day and as soon as we stepped into Grumpy's, it instantly felt warm and cozy. We were seated at a table by a window, which I loved. They have a little coffee bar in the front room. You can order coffees and tea. We tried the berry lemonade and peach green tea. Both were absolutely delicious and refreshing! I ordered the Grumpy's breakfast and my boyfriend ordered the breakfast tacos. Both of our dishes were made with super fresh ingredients. The service was fast and the food was amazing. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"After visiting Grumpy's twice, I have downgraded my rating to 2 stars.  Why you ask?  Because for the prices the food is dramatically under-seasoned and just flat out underwhelming.  Grumpy's should be considered a last resort when you have exhausted all other Tremont and Ohio City eateries.  And the dry erase board that they move around from table to table with the specials (and prop up against your table so the table next to you can read the specials) is amateur.  Have your waitstaff memorize the specials instead of inconveniencing other diners."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and folks at the baseball game suggested Grumpy's as it was near where we were staying. Thanks to those folks for an A+ recommendation.   We'd had a long day hiking the day before and a late night with a rain-delayed baseball game, so we were hungry and looking to fill up before leaving town. Grumpy's delivered.   They were busy but not stuffed and we were immediately seated. Our server was great - friendly and efficient and our coffee was always topped up.   I had some apple oatmeal pancakes that were beyond delicious. They came with a cinnamon butter that put them over the top. They were hearty and filling and unique and delicious. I devoured them.   Husband had a skillet and though he liked it, it was spicy. Chorizo, jalapenos and the house Cajun potatoes, which have a kick, had him going through multiple glasses of water. Totally worth it, he said, but be forewarned.   This was a seriously cute place with inventive, inexpensive food and a great staff. I wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Three of us decided to stop here for brunch after a 5k in Cleveland.  The place was packed with a lot of people waiting for a table. We were happy to find out it was only a twenty minute wait. We read the menu while waiting and everything sounded delicious. The inside while small is very quaint and clean. The waitress was at our table within seconds of seating us. She brought us coffee right away and took our orders. The food came out quickly and was delicious. Amazing omelette a! The potatoes were also tasty. Great value and friendly service. No wonder so many people have recommended this place. We were also happy to see a parking lot! Parking can be tough around that area."}
{"text":"Always amazing no matter what time of the day it is. Huge fan of thief breakfast tacos! Food is always fresh and staff is very friendly. Great place!"}
{"text":"I've heard many good things about this establishment so my expectations were high....the sad thing about high expectations, the only way to go is down, and down this place went.  I visited this place a few months ago and I finally decided to write a review.  I like the atmosphere, it's like coming into a house.  There were a couple places to be seated at and we were seated in the biggest room.  It took a minute to get serviced which was shocking because there weren't very many people there as it was a weekday morning.  The waitress came to our table only four times :to get our orders, give us drinks, deliver our food, and give us the check.  We were never asked how the food was (It wasn't that great) and we were never given coffee/drink refills.  We mostly saw her sitting at a table shooting the shit with a coworker.  The food was nothing like I expected.  I was expecting these decent size pancakes and nicely seasoned home fries.  The pancakes were supposed to be pumpkin flavored and there was not a single hint of pumpkin about them.  They were very small as well and compared poorly with other pancakes I have had at other places.  The \"cajun\" homefries had nothing cajun about them, they were hardly seasoned and the portion was ridiculously small, maybe 1/2 cup at the most.  I don't think I have it in me to come here again."}
{"text":"Grumpy's is a hot spot for breakfast! The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the staff was truly amazing! They have such pride in their restaurant and you can tell in their service and the quality of food. We ordered the Western Hash and French toast. Must stop when in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"The inside of Grumpy's is quite appealing, painted in bright colors and with photographs of Cleveland scenes shot by local professionals hanging on the wall. The restaurant is one of those places with a high industrial ceiling that magnifies noise. Don't try giving election secrets to Russian operatives here; it's very easy to hear the conversation of others.  I ordered the Apple Oatmeal Pancakes with cinnamon butter and Cajun home fries. I also ordered a side of corn beef hash because I had read a review that raved about it.  The corn beef hash was very tasty and I also appreciated the home fries being \"kicked up\" a bit by the Cajun spice. The pancakes were ponderous discs, very heavy tasting and dry. It must have been all the oatmeal in them. They were not really to my liking. I prefer a fluffier grilled batter. The cinnamon flavored butter didn't much improve things. Maple syrup may have helped but I was told Grumpy's doesn't serve the \"pure\" kind.  No thanks. Log Cabin, Aunt Jemima, Kirkland, et. al. are maple FLAVORED syrups that hold no appeal for me.  Our server was a human dynamo, visiting our table on numerous occasions but only staying for about 1 1/2 seconds to take our orders, make sure we were doing okay, refilling cups, and taking away dishes. I got tired watching her. I don't know where she got the energy at such an early hour of the morning but my guess is that it wasn't from the really weak coffee. More commentary with photos at usabreakfast.blogspot.com."}
{"text":"Thank you for being open on Labor Day, when it seemed most brunch places in CLE were closed.  Thank you for providing my introduction to corned beef hash (my hometown girl was craving some - where did a lil lady from Orange County, CA learn about this stuff?).  Thank you for having great coffee, good atmosphere, a delicious, greasy Cajun omelette, and for only being a 10 minute wait."}
{"text":"Great staff and service. Excellent food. Cajun home fries were extremely tasty. Cornbeef Hash was the best we've had, eggs Benedict was good, meatloaf was great."}
{"text":"I don't usually give 5 stars but I had absolutely nothing to criticize on my visit to Grumpy's. Coffee was provided in the waiting area and the staff was all very friendly (not grumpy to my surprise). I Ordered the Porky Omlette which was very good and nothing like I had tried for breakfast before. Pulled pork, ham, bacon, Swiss, Saracha, hollandaise, and bbq sauce. I was a little nervous at first with the sauce combinations but there was a perfect amount of each that made it delicious. Served with rye and home fries. Tons of original/different menu items for breakfast.  Very \"home-like\" atmosphere. Would definitely recommend for breakfast. I think my meal was about $13-$15."}
{"text":"Hmmm, is it really worth to wait 1 hour just to get an omelet and coffee. I really don't think so. The food is good, but I mean , if you cannot really manage your busy morning rush to make some omelets and easy breakfast stuff and offer to your customers,  then maybe you should think about hiring more help in the kitchen.  Seriously,  go somewhere else. Not worth the wait. It is not like they flew a fresh salmon from Alaska a night before and cooked it to a perfection. It is omelet for God's sake"}
{"text":"Cute setting. Close to downtown. Good service. Eggs Benedict had a soggy muffin but otherwise tasty.  My husband had the hash... that was the best I've ever tried!"}
{"text":"While Grumpy's was a warm welcoming restaurant (I especially loved the photography exhibit on the walls), I was more than disappointed with my meal.   I was surprised at the limited choices on the menu, but they offered Eggs Benedict which is easily my favorite breakfast option so I settled quickly on my order.  I think I need to stop talking about the last time I had a bad benny, because right as I finished telling my sister about a particularly horrible hollandaise, I taste the extraordinarily buttery sauce covering my poached eggs and sighed in defeat. Not only was the hollandaise strange, they overcooked the yolks in both my dish and my sister's breakfast.   While our server was friendly, he never brought me a water despite asking three times, and coffee refills were few and far between. The prices were decent, but definitely worth checking somewhere else out in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Some of the best brunch I've had in Cleveland! It's usually pretty busy,  but I've never waited nearly as long as the hostess predicted. A quick Google search can give you its peak hours. Despite a bit of a wait sometimes, the food is served FAST and tastes great. I keep coming back for the biscuits and gravy.  And can I just say... snaps to this awesome cafe for showcasing local artists' beautiful work. I have been eyeing a few pieces for a while now - and wouldn't have known about them without the cafe. Support your local businesses!"}
{"text":"Pretty good but not great! We went here for brunch/lunch with party of four. Food was better than average, but not fabulous. Service was wonderful. Cost for four (basic meal and coffees) was $56 (including tip). My chorizo burrito was OK...sorta ho hum. Best thing on the table was my wife's \"meatloaf melt\" Pleasant place....we'll probably give it another try soon.."}
{"text":"If you're visiting from out of town like me, this is a great breakfast spot to check out. The food is reasonably priced, and didn't take long to arrive to our table after we ordered. I had the peanut butter chocolate chip french toast, and it was delicious! The addition of cajun home fries was a good partnership, although they could've been cooked a little longer (still great). There is a ton of local art for sale to check out and a heated patio waiting area with free coffee if needed."}
{"text":"This is what smaller restaurants are supposed to be.  Great food, best in class service.  Our waitress Sarah was fantastic.   We had the jambalaya omelet and home made hash.  Simply OUTSTANDING!!!!  We ecen left with a Grumpys t-shirt.  Cant wait to xome back to Cleveland and visit Grumpys....."}
{"text":"Grumpy's Cafe is a quaint little restaurant off W14 in Tremont. It is located next to Lincoln  Park Pub. The decor is original like most restaurants in Tremont. Perfect restaurant for brunch or lunch. Great staff, food and pricing."}
{"text":"Went here for bfast this morn, and I was impressed. 4.5 stars.  Arrived and was seated immediately, with a smile. Thought they were grumpy here? Anyway the interior was kind of industrial meets hippie, with local art for sale on the walls. Warm colors and more space inside than I imagined. The faux gilded ceiling was a bit cheesy but most people wouldn't notice. Customers were of every creed and color, which is always nice, because while Clevelanders are nice, we aren't always the most culturally diverse. I thought my steak and mushroom omelette was super, the wife was ok with her french toast, but she is picky and I'm writing the review, haha. I will say, the sausage had a little \"off\" flavor, but not overly so and it could just be me.   This place has my regular breakfast place beat in all ways except proximity, but not a biggie as Grumpy's is less than 15 from the house. I guess the price is high-ish too but worth it considering the quality of service and food."}
{"text":"had a clam bake on Friday night and it was fabulous.  So were the servers.   Loved it"}
{"text":"2.5 Stars After hearing from several people about how Grumpy's has the BEST brunch, we decided to give it a shot. We obviously arrived at a bad time (just behind a large party) and waited over an HOUR for a breakfast burrito, steak and eggs omelet, and pancakes. This is a tiny, tiny kitchen for such a large dining space + outdoor patio, and the wait time was really unacceptable. Thankfully, the management recognized this and took a deduction from our bill -- Kudos to them for doing the right thing. The graciousness of the staff salvaged the experience, because the food was OK, but definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"We loved this place. Good sized portions and delicious food. There were 5 of us, we all ordered something different and NO ONE was disappointed! I love the little details, non matching coffee mugs, fun art, larger tables available, not to loud or noisy. Someone in the party got this bacon covered in pancake batter thing OMGosh... I am making this at home!"}
{"text":"Breakfast tacos are on point. Pumpkin pancakes were delicious  It gets pretty crowded on the weekends so be prepared to wait in line"}
{"text":"You will not be impressed, but you may not be completely disappointed... If your expectations are low. Menu is sub par next to all the options nearby. Food is not fresh, homemade, or anything to be excited about. No signature dishes.. Burger patty is not good.. Breakfast food is what you would expect... if you have low expectations.. I think you get it."}
{"text":"Came with a big group of 16 and the service was great! Our food was timely and very good. We brought our own champagne for mimosas and they kept the OJ flowing. Overall a good experience here with a good vibe."}
{"text":"Gave it 4 stars because the service could be better.  As far as food, atmosphere and location goes, this place is perfect. I go here almost every weekend. Breakfast is phenomenal. Prices affordable."}
{"text":"Somehow I've enjoyed grumpys a totally if 3 times this year and haven't left a review. Love this place! Great food, great staff, unique decor...very Cleveland themed. I always get breakfast from here and I usually go in the morning around 9am so the wait is never long.   However, I did go once on a Friday morning with a group of 7 and although we called in earlier and said we had a large party (instructions per the website) we still had about a 40 minute wait which was frustrating. Once we got our table though they were very apologetic since they knew we'd called in and still had to wait. We got good service, complimentary cookies, I think the waitress even told a party who'd been there too long to leave so they could set up a spot for us.   I would highly recommend this place! It's right by a park too so you can go walking around after eating. Parking fills up pretty fast on busy days since the lot it a bit small."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday for brunch and was seated right away outside on their small patio. We ordered the sausage gravy and biscuits and an egg scramble with chorizo. Both were great! The hash browns were flavorful with a slight kick from the Cajun seasoning, but would prefer them a little crispier. Service was good, but a little slow."}
{"text":"We just used their private space to have our work awards luncheon this afternoon.  I thought we'd have the whole space to ourselves but they had others seated with us which made it awkward while presenting awards.  I had the mac & cheese with andouille and spinach.  Yum!  The food came out quickly and I didn't hear any complaints from my coworkers.  I love that they have a good sized parking lot -- a rarity in Tremont.  I hadn't been here in a long time but now that I've been back I'll make plans to return soon."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends at around 11:30 am and their wait time was around 15 minutes. The hostess/waitress were both very kind and prompt.   I got a plate of strawberry cream cheese French toast which comes with Cajun potatoes. The French toast was pretty good (7/10) and the potatoes were on the dry side (5/10). I expected the potatoes to have more flavor.   Overall, the atmosphere was bustling with people coming in and out."}
{"text":"Haven't yet had a bad experience. I've ordered breakfast and lunch here, and been with smaller and bigger groups. Most importantly, my wife likes it here. The food is fantastic, and I suppose one couldn't go wrong with any selection from their menu. We're here now waiting to be seated, and I assure you - a 30-35 minute wait for Grumpy's is worthwhile. Cheers to you!"}
{"text":"So this is THE hungover breakfast spot for this girl. The breakfast food is inexpensive and delicious. I usually make reservations and still have to wait a solid 20 minutes so note this ahead of time because it can be frustrating. They have a tented patio area with heaters and free coffee to wait though which is nice. I always get the classic grumpy's special with pancakes. They are flexible with substitutions and have tasty poached eggs with that combo.   I went for dinner and lunch several times and enjoyed it but I still vote breakfast as their go-to highlight. It is nice area to walk around tremont afterwards to work off some of that cheesy egg goodness!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars:  The place is homey, warm, and inviting like having breakfast in grandma's living room / dining room.  It has sharp bursts of bright colors, photos of nice landmarks, and aromatic smells roaming throughout the restaurant.  It reminds me slightly of a greasy diner, except a little more, dare I say, sophisticated?  The service moved a quickly as soon as you sat down, as inferred from the menu at the bottom (\"please considerate of others waiting for tables- enjoy and see you next time!\").  I completely understand, no one wants to wait for a table.  The waitress is relatively attentive and patient as we got our orders all in.    We ordered Chocolate Chip Pancakes, West 14th Special (corned beef hash) and a Vegetarian Omelet.  We also got sides of Biscuits / Sausage Gravy and fruit:  The chocolate chip pancakes nice and fluffy, never needing a dash of syrup; however, it could have used maybe 2-3 more chocolate chips to make sure you at least a chocolate chip in each bit of pancake.    I was slightly disappointed with their homemade corned beef hash (W. 14th Special).   I am used to corned beef hash fresh from the flat top with a slight crunchiness to it from sitting on a flat-top grill with crispy bites of potato and hash in each forkful; however it wasn't crispy and it was a disproportionate ratio of meat and potato.   It was almost like they had pre-prepared a giant batch of corned beef hash and left it in a warming container and just dumped it onto a plate with each order. The eggs were nicely done and rounded out the hash.    The vegetarian omelet was delicious with a heaping amount of vegetables and eggs; although, I would have preferred the omelet to come with cheddar, in lieu of plain American cheese.  The omelet tastes better with a little pepper and the \"watered-down Frank's Red Hot Sauce.\"  I was slightly disappointed with the cajun potatoes, as well.  The cajun potatoes didn't pack a Cajun punch or very much seasoning.  It definitely needed a little more seasoning and maybe ketchup.    The biscuits and gravy were fairly decent, I could definitely taste more of the roux than the sausage in the sausage gravy.  The biscuit was not quite as flaky as I had expected or as crusty, as I had before.  The fruit was sweet and juicy and very refreshing after heavy, greasy breakfast.    I do love the fact that it is BYOB and you can bring in anything you would like and you're not constrained to the drink menu.    The breakfast is a great deal, my friends also ordered an additional 2 entrees and we paid a total of $30.00 a person after everything!"}
{"text":"We spent Easter Weekend in Cleveland our last stop for food was breakfast at Grumpy's before heading on a 7 hour drive home to NJ. I'm giving this place 3 stars for the reason the eggs were scrambled and served raw. They were half liquid yolk on both dishes. The orange juice was served in a hot glass causing it get to room temperature. The place was packed and I understand food needs to move out of the kitchen rapidly. That is no excuse  for serving raw eggs. The corned beef hash was amazing and the pancakes are fluffy with a buttery taste. I don't ever make a complaint or send food back. The portion size was plenty for the rest of my meal.   The staff are super friendly and chill. The owner showed up and chatted with me for a moment. I recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"I loved this place. I called just to make sure they accept dogs. They have a nice patio area. Service was friendly and helpful. I went there with my three kids during our road trip from Chicago to CT. I had the breakfast special everything was great ( real hash ). I would like thicker bacon. My first son had blueberry pancakes with fresh blueberries AWESOME. Second son Breakfast sandwich damn good. My daughter had the Chorizo burrito. THE BEST. I haven't had Chorizo since moving from Cali. it was damn good. Yes I had a bite of everyone's because the kids could not finish all of it. they were full. All for a very reasonable price. If I were to say any improvments would be thicker bacon and bigger sausage. other than that spot on. I hope to make it back there."}
{"text":"Great breakfast options and the cajun home fries are the bomb in a skillet!"}
{"text":"For more years then I can remember I've been told, \"You really HAVE to try this place in Tremont called Grumpy's\" - or in the least some variation of that sentiment.  There were usually many additional flourishes including the cozy atmosphere, the cool artwork on the walls, and the great food.  So, with all of those things in mind I made a visit.  What I found was uncomfortable seating with a table that no amount of sugar packets could keep stable, a collection of photos none-too-impressive, and food that wasn't quite up to par with some of the more dubious cafe/diner options around CLE.  I'm not trying to put anyone in their places as Grumpy's has been around for a while, and people do seem to enjoy it.  Rather, I just wanted to clarify that Grumpy's is not the end-all, be-all eatery that some people claim it to be.    In terms of cost there also is a bit of an upcharge when compared to other breakfast places, and a lack of quality to go along with it.  For the most part we're talking about omlettes here people!  The \"upcharge\" for being seated next to trendy hipsters repeating Ira Glass' most current podcast just isn't worth it for me."}
{"text":"We were looking for a breakfast/brunch place after realizing that the West Side Market was closed on Sundays.  Grumpy's was GREAT!  As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a steamy cup of coffee in cute novelty mugs by a friendly hostess.  We were able to wait for our table on the covered patio while browsing their large brunch menu.  Once we were quickly seated, we enjoyed some walnut french toast, a Grumpy's Special Breakfast, and morning meatloaf with an over easy egg.  It was WONDERFUL.  We would HIGHLY recommend Grumpy's to anyone visiting Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Came here very early in the morning at about 630AM without a reservation. They have a decent sized parking lot with quite a bit of seating inside. They seated our relatively large party quickly and took our orders without hesitation. The coffee was not the greatest, but the caffeine was there. The food, though, was excellent. I ordered the Grumpy's Special, which was a helluva lot of food for very little money. If you're in the area, it's worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Great location in a neat house, but the food as nothing special. We all had variations on the Grumpy breakfast and were all happy,  There's nothing spectacular about the food, but the servers were friendly and warm and efficient, and we had a great time."}
{"text":"The breakfast food was great and the service was good too.  But one of our cars with out of state plates was burglarized in broad, sunny daylight.  The thieves seemed to target tourists.  And the local police weren't able to recover any of the stolen goods. Area is a bit sketchy so be careful."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with my family while in Cleveland this weekend.  Food and service was excellent. Prices very reasonable. The place is small but we didn't have to wait to be seated."}
{"text":"After researching \"the best brunch spots in Cleveland,\" we chose to try out Grumpy's! The only thing that made us grumpy was how long we had to wait for our food. However, the food was awesome when it finally came and the staff were apologetic. Would recommend this place for breakfast if you're not in a rush!"}
{"text":"It's pretty much what I expected, a pretty typical diner place. They had very good service. I appreciated the free coffee while we were waiting for a table in the heated front walkway. And the servers and hostess were working hard to keep everyone happy. The food was just ehh typical. Cute place though and one of the very few open Jan1 for brunch."}
{"text":"On a random Tuesday morning, my best friend Lisa invited me to breakfast at one of her favorite breakfast spots in Tremont. If you want to know anything about Lisa, just know that she LOVES good food and isn't shy to say when she doesn't love something. So since this place came highly recommended by her, I knew I had to try it. Plus, I love the Tremont neighborhood so that alone made the 25 minute trek worth it.   Though I went during the work week, the parking lot outside Grumpy's was pretty full.  I can't imagine how hard it would be to find a spot during the weekend. Anywho, once inside, I found the interior to be nicely decorated although smaller than what I expected. The waitress acknowledged us right away and allowed us to thoroughly study the menu. (I basically have to read the entire menu before making my decision. It's annoying, I know, but the waitress was patient and I greatly appreciate that!)   So after studying the menu, I finally decided on the sausage gravy and biscuits. Lisa ordered an omelette (forgot which one, sorry) and a side order of the strawberry french toast. Both portions were pretty large. I found my dish to be pretty basic and honestly,  a little disappointing after Lisa's rave review. But, the saving grace was the amazing french toast! Lisa let me taste hers and let me just say, I would definitely make a second visit to Grumpy's for the french toast alone. I would also order one of the classic dishes next time.   Overall, Grumpy's offers a wide range of menu items and is worth a visit, especially since it's located in the cute Tremont neighborhood. I would return, but I would make sure to atleast have a side order of that amazing french toast."}
{"text":"I love grumpys breakfast! It's consistently yummy.... whether you grab an omelette or an eggs Benedict, or fluffy chocolate chip pancakes, this place rocks. It's a great place for little kids and families with their extensive menu and fun but cozy ambience. Service is always friendly. Only downside is that I often have wait for a table and sometimes the kitchen backs up. Otherwise, it's a great experience! Be sure to get their Cajun home fries. They're the bomb."}
{"text":"Love Grumpy's breakfast! Everything we have tried from omelets to pancakes to French toast , especially the Cajun home fries ....everything is wonderful! We've never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Grumpy's Cafe  For Weekly Reviews like Cleveland Bites!  I love brunch! Saturday brunch is my favorite time of the week and finding a good brunch place is not as easy as you might think. Sure plenty of places serve eggs, but very few do it with style! This Saturday my wife and I checked out a little place I've seen in Tremont called Grumpy's Cafe. We got in around 10 and it was PACKED! Even still we were seated right away because the place is quite big. It was a bustling atmosphere with friends and family's getting a good plate of food to start their busy Saturday's off right. It's nice and bright inside thanks to the natural lighting of the skylights and the place is alive with vibrant colors and kitschy Cleveland artwork. I could tell that this place was a place to be for breakfast. It's pretty loud inside for all that and our table was less than a foot away from another table which had two people carrying on a rather loud conversation, but it couldn't be helped.  The menu had a large option of sweet and savory breakfast choices. Most of them seemed like traditional fare and a few unique outliers. I settled on the 'Walker Hash' (Chirizo, Andouille, Okra, Cajun Potatoes, Cheddar, and 2 eggs) I ordered them sunny side up with rye toast. My wife had the 'Veggie Benedict' (English muffins, Hollandaise, tomato, avocado, poached eggs, and Cajun potatoes) in lieu of her normal pancake order for breakfast.  The food came out quick and had a nice presentation to it. The waitress we had was attentive and friendly and kept our waters topped off. I absolutely enjoyed my spicy hash! Lots of hot sauce and a small splash of ketchup ensured that it was gone VERY quickly! My wife's food was very fresh and tasty as well. I can always appreciate a fresh light breakfast from time to time.  I don't know if this is the best breakfast I've ever had because good breakfast is just that, good breakfast. What I do know is that Grumpy's Cafe does what they set out to do very very well and that's have a great space to enjoy good breakfast food with people you love to start your day out right. I will definitely be returning! Bill for 2 with water and breakfast meals was $25.  Atmosphere - **** Price -              *** Quality -          *** Taste -             **** Service -         ****  Good Points - Great fun place to meet up with people for breakfast. - Food was prepared well and quick. - Staff was gracious and friendly.  Bad Points - A bit crowded if you are the claustrophobic type. - If you're looking for super unique combinations this isn't your place."}
{"text":"Awesome place! So cute, great food great service, great atmosphere! Definitely try it out"}
{"text":"This place was great! We went for brunch while in town and loved every bit of it. The only downside was they don't have many options from non-pork eaters (I have that problem a lot). I had the Cajun chicken Alfredo and it was delicious. My husband had the Jambalaya Omelet and he really enjoyed it. We come to Cleveland once a year and I see this place becoming a regular."}
{"text":"I visited grumpy's on a Wednesday morning. Unfortunately, the breakfast menu stops at 11:30, but they have a delightful \"breakfast for lunch\" menu that I ordered off of.  Service-wise, the staff was pleasant and courteous, and they split 8 checks for us, which was very helpful. They were also prompt and got us out within an hour, which is pretty good for an eight-person table.   For my meal, I had grumpy's special with blueberry pancakes, which also had home fries, toast, and two eggs. Food-wise, the eggs were fried well, the pancakes were good but not amazing (and for $10 I expect real maple syrup and not the fake stuff, and l was disappointed that they served the fake stuff), and the home fries were actually quite disappointing; they were under seasoned but covered in something spicy that did little but provide heat. Reasonably cooked, though.  I will come back here without reservation if asked but probably won't make an explicit trip."}
{"text":"The server was very sincere, but the food was not so good. I had the apple oatmeal pancakes, and couldn't detect any oatmeal. The syrup they served with it had a strange aftertaste. My boyfriend ordered the breakfast burrito, and was thoroughly dissapointed.   Although, my boyfriend and I both agreed that the cajun homefries were wonderful!   Its in a very cute area, and seemed to be a great place for families on the weekends. I wouldn't recommend it if you were going for the food."}
{"text":"For the past few years, I have frequented Grumpy's Café as a patron. I've always appreciated the great food and the comfortable setting that was provided after every visit. However, I'd recently come in to celebrate a birthday and I left the restaurant feeling confused and deeply disrespected. I came to dine for brunch and visit with my dear friends whom I do not get to see frequently. We were having an amazing time eating, drinking, talking and laughing. We were enjoying coffee and company for about an hour and a half or so before when we noticed we were being nastily looked at by the hostess and waitresses of the restaurant. We immediately felt uncomfortable. Thus, we started to get prepared to leave. Before getting that opportunity we were approached from a waitress, or the owner, I'm not sure, and we were ASKED to leave, because \"there were other patrons who were waiting on a seat. Can you imagine, as paying customers, being asked to leave so that other patrons can have a chance to dine? Under no circumstance is it polite or even fathomable to insinuate, encourage or even ASK another patron to leave, simply because they've eaten and are sitting at the table conversing.  What's the most troubling is that adjacent to our table, were another group of three individuals who were dining from the time we initially were brought to our table, and they were still present as we were being asked to leave. If it were policy to ask diners to leave after staying past the allotted dining time, then why wasn't this group approached and asked to leave so that others can have that table?? I couldn't help but feel as if we were targeted due to the type of patron we are, African Americans.  I've never felt more disrespected, belittled, embarrassed, and shocked in my life of dining experiences. If there is a rule against dining with your friends, and conversing and having a good time, even on a busy day and staying past an hour, this should be clearly communicated so that one should prepare to grab food, eat quickly and go so that they're not holding table's hostage from other patrons.  I am disgusted that a place that prides itself on being with \"family\" and projecting a familial spirit would have the audacity to approach me in that manner. You make the claim that you want everyone to feel \"good\" when they leave, however I have never felt so low. This is unacceptable and I hope that you find it within your policy to NEVER make a guest feel unwelcomed or have the feeling that they will be asked to leave. In due time I hope you've learned to respect EVERY PERSON that spends their money in your establishment."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday around noon and got brunch with a friend. The parking lot was packed so I assumed there would be a wait but to my surprise...not really. We sat by the window so it was a nice view. The place is cozy to bring a group of people and the staff was not grumpy at all. The decor is somewhat country-like, very bright colors to wake people up, lol. Overall, the place is comfortable. They even have a little patio out by the side which compliments my liking of restaurants with patios. :)  I ordered their literary omelette with added mushrooms and tomatoes. It had sausage, green peppers, onions and cheese! My friend ordered their Western omelette which had ham, green peppers and onions. Both tasted great and definitely hit the spot for our stomachs. I'd come again."}
{"text":"People rave about Grumpy's brunch but I wasn't impressed.  Everything on the menu sounded delicious but the eggs benedict I ordered was not so much.  I think hollandaise sauce can often be a good indicator of how good the cooking is at a restaurant.  The hollandaise that came with my benedict was more gloopy than creamy.  it almost seemed more gelatin based than eggs & buttery.  Even looking at it, it looked more sort of translucent and thick rather than creamy."}
{"text":"We had the biscuits and gravy and added one side of bacon. Service was okay, not overly friendly but food was great. The cajan potatoes are on point!"}
{"text":"Bobby and I both agreed that this was by far, the best brunch we have ever had.  Better than any food we have received at well-known spots featured on TV shows in Pittsburgh, better than high end restaurants either of us have visited and better than any formal event that has served brunch.  We were in Cleveland for the weekend looking for somewhere close to eat.  We stayed in Tremont and this was literally less than a block away.  My friend almost scared us away when she said it was just a basic brunch place that didn't serve mimosas or bloodys, but she did say it was BYOB which was confirmed when I called Grumpy's really quickly.  Around 130 on a Sunday, we were seated with no problem.  We stopped and got some beer to enjoy with our meal.  I ordered the eggs Florentine and the waitress suggested my eggs be runny, but I chose scrambled instead and added avocado.  Bobby ordered their eggs benedict, added avocado and a side of bacon.  I got a cup of coffee, as well.  Even their coffee was fresh and delicious!  They had some apple cinnamon French toast on the menu that I almost, ALMOST gave in and ordered, but I knew it would make me sick.  I decided against it and went with an egg and veggie breakfast, and once I tried it - I didn't even miss the French toast option.  Our meal didn't take long to come out and it was absolutely delicious.  I didn't add a single grain of salt or pepper because the flavor was so rich and perfect on its own.  Bobby's eggs were cooked perfectly and he also thoroughly enjoyed his plate.  Our waitress was quick and attentive and it was a cute little atmosphere with the option of outdoor seating.  Very reasonably priced and no fee if you BYOB.  I know we will be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Quick service,  great customer service and delicious  food. Loved the little waiting porch with free coffee. I ordered the Veggie Benedict .....yum"}
{"text":"Grumpy's gives off an aura of anything but what the name implies. I have never come here and left \"grumpy.\" Their assortment of coffee mugs drives home the true \"ham and egger\" vibe. 10/10 recommend the potatoes. Delicious eats at a reasonable cost make for the perfect brunch spot."}
{"text":"Had the fajita omelet and the peanut butter chocolate chip French toast.....it was killer. I've also had the breakfast tacos which were amazing! Next time I need to try the bacon pancake dippers!"}
{"text":"As a southerner, I am picky about my biscuits and gravy.  As a stubborn southerner, I keep ordering them and hoping that they'll live up to my standards.  Well, let me tell you, these yankees know how to properly prepare biscuits and gravy.  The biscuits were massive, flaky, buttery, and perfect.  The gravy was sausage filled and savory.  The dish also came with eggs which I ordered scrambled soft, assuming they would be cooked too hard, but they too, were perfect.  My dining companion got corned beef and hash and found it to be full of flavor, with a generous portion.  We sat at the lunch counter and it was pretty quiet on a Saturday morning, but we were glad to get there when we did as they were on a wait when we left.  Great neighborhood, perfect to talk a post meal walk, although there is plenty of parking."}
{"text":"It was good, but not extraordinary.  I believe they rotate the menu frequently so we would go back to try things out again.  It was very busy and they do not take reservations unless larger 8+ party."}
{"text":"I just don't know if I'll be giving Grumpy's another try.  Our brunch there was just one of those not really memorable things.  Nothing stood out as being great....nothing stood out as being really crappy either.  It was just \"ok\".  In fact, given the choice between Grumpy's and Lucky's the other morning on our way out of town, we chose Lucky's even though it was definitely more expensive.  After reading some of the other reviews, I can probably guess why our experience wasn't fantastic.....we like to order eggs.  While I am a huge fan of pancakes, I generally base my opinion of a place on an egg dish (I feel like I'm starting to sound like Wylie Dufresne of wd~50).  If eggs don't pass the standard, then I'm not likely to go back.  I ordered the eggs benny, one of my favorite dishes, it was bland and the hollandaise, well, it sucked to be honest.  I still find it strange that if you asked for an egg \"soft\" in Cleveland, you will usually get a runny egg white as well....and that's what happened here too....who likes a runny egg white, \"soft\" references the yolk!!  Home fries were not pleasing either.  I do like the fact they feature local artists on the walls, but it's not really anything unique to them, pretty much EVERY place in Tremont does that.    If I ever do make it back here, I will probably have to order the pancakes, but no matter how good they are, I will still judge this place on their crappy egg dishes.....there are far better places in the city for breakfast and brunch for me to go back to (Le Petit and Tremont Tap House come to mind immediately)."}
{"text":"Another vacation, another awesome breakfast experience. Grumpy's is a cute little brunch spot that offers all the things I love. Omelette's, taters, toast and lot's of coffee. The decor is artsy and welcoming. The wall's are covered with works from local Cleveland artists and the staff couldn't have been nicer.     For my entree, I ordered the Starkweather Omelette. It was filled with Chorizo, peppers and other southwestern goodies. It was delicious. Eggs, taters and coffee. What else do you need?    So the next time you're in Cleveland and have a hankering for a good breakfast in a cool, artsy setting, go and see the good people at Grumpy's. Your stomach will be happy you did."}
{"text":"Long wait time on Sunday but the food came out fast and what I ordered was delicious. I had the stuffed French toast and the chicken & pesto omelette. Service was ok the space is a little tight but you're not sitting on top of each other like some restaurants. The food... My food was worth the price. I cannot speak on the other menu options that I didn't have; only the atmosphere, service and my food. I recommend you check Grumpy's out and provide your opinion. I think you might leave happy."}
{"text":"Our Sunday breakfast spot. Husband is still hooked on the $4.99 Grumpy's Special (2 eggs, meat, toast, Cajun hash browns). I've graduated to the Jambalya omelette - rich and spicy creole rice with chicken and andouille on the inside - gooey, mellow melted yellow cheese sauce & 1 perfect shrimp on the outside - pure YUM - also comes with the Cajun hash browns & toast. Coffee & iced tea are always filled, warm syrup, house hot sauce & ketchup always arrive before the food - seem simple - but these are signs of great service and all of the servers here get it. Don't miss it!!"}
{"text":"Veggie Benedict is a brilliant spin on a true classic.  Yum-O!  Hubby had a. ig bowl of oatmeal with fresh fruit and a big Western omelet he was very pleased with as well. Decor clean and modern.  Like that they decorate with local artist's flair for sale.  Staff friendly and quick.  May be one of our new favorite breakfast spots!"}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviews. The menu is inventive. I had the oatmeal with apples walnuts and cranberries. It's unsweetened. Which is nice, you can add your own sweetener. They charged for a small pitcher of almond milk for my coffee.   Try to sit in the back room.  The front room by the door there's a lot of in-and-out traffic. The service was efficient. There's a decent size parking lot."}
{"text":"Gotta wait for a seat, no worries. They have complimentary java...drink it now because it's $2.50 on the menu!  They also have an air-controlled, enclosed patio to keep you warm or cool until you get paged fir your table!  Fast, friendly servers... Vast variety of food items... Egg-celent prices for plenty of food... Awesome CLE art fir your pleas here or at home... Great location. .. I'll definitely add this to my TOP 5 breakfast,  brunch spots...along with Inn on Coventry and Tommy's. ..both also locally-owned!"}
{"text":"byob is kind of the best thing ever so i'll be back for that. i was not impressed by my breakfast though. i had the benedict. the avocado was solid. like i could barely cut it with a knife. that is really not how avocado is supposed to be. i'll have to be back to try something else. waitress was really nice though!"}
{"text":"Decided to try for breakfast last Saturday.  Waited around 10 mins to be seated. There seemed to be plenty of open tables but they must have been trying to space the seating out  which we were okay with. The staff was very friendly. The dining room felt a little cramped. In fact we sat close enough to another table that we met a couple that was from Detroit passing through Cleveland. Now to the important stuff.. THE FOOD.  I ordered the chorizo breakfast burrito which was fantastic. The chorizo sausage was not at all greasy and was seasoned well. I also ordered some sausage gravy and biscuit which was very good. My wife ordered the Grumpys special which is your conventional eggs and bacon breakfast which she loved. She also ordered a small order of the pumpkin pancakes which were awesome. Did I mention the Cajun home fries? I could have made a meal out of them. They were so good. Going back this weekend to try the jambalaya omelet. Looking forward to trying dinner also."}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times since moving to Cleveland and I always leave happy. I've gotten their jambalaya omelet which sounded odd but was really good. This is the ideal 'wake up on sunday morning, throw your hair up, put on a pair of loose waisted pants, and prepare to fully recover from your precious night's decisions' kind of place. The one waitress (Katie?) was really sweet and efficient. I would recommend making a reservation when you're going for brunch. I've heard that they do lunch and dinner too which I'm sure would be good. One thing I really like about this place is the cozy at-home feeling. The dishes are all casual and a mix of different types. Side note- it's BYOB, which I didn't realize the first time. It's a cute place to go for brunch with some friends and bring along some mimosas :)"}
{"text":"I usually eat Saturday breakfast at Lucky's in Tremont.  But today, for whatever reason, I decided to go see why Grumpy's always seems to have a line out the door.  In hindsight, I wish I had gone to Lucky's.   I got to Grumpy's probably around 9:15am, and it was rather bustling, but no line had appeared as yet.  I grabbed a seat at the counter and noticed the place was clean, and decorated well.  It doesn't look like a large place; there has to be more seating towards the rear, because they had some 6 or 7 servers working.  I was treated very well by the staff and everyone appeared to be smiling; I consider this a big plus.   The menu is interesting, lots of wheat based breads (for instance the breakfast burrito is listed as a wheat tortilla, one reason I didn't select it).  Long story short, I decided to try the eggs benedict, which is served with potatoes.  I also requested some sausage and a small stack of pumpkin pancakes.   Yes, I know it's a lot of food, but I wanted to get a taste of the place. It took For.Ev.Er. to get my food.  In fact, it was about a half hour.  I could see the stress developing on the manager?'s face as the food from the kitchen was slowing.  She apologized to me that it took so long.  I wasn't upset, disappointed, but not upset.   When my food came it was quite eye-opening; for a few reasons.  One thing, both my eggs benedict plate and my pancake \"small stack\" were served with their home fries.  I didn't need/want two servings of potatoes.  Also, they have a cayenne pepper shaker in the kitchen window and just about everything gets a final shake from the server who's bringing the food.  So, yeah, I pretty well got maced from the aroma of the food.  Another reviewer mentioned the potatoes could benefit from a lot less pepper and a good bit more salt.  I agree.   My eggs benedict (and this is the first time I've had eggs benedict, mind you) was... meh.  I suppose that's what a poached egg's consistency is like- soft all-around.  I'd much prefer one prepared on the flat-top, with some bite.  The english muffin was not toasted.  It tasted like it came straight out of the bag, and then they dressed it up with the ham, egg and hollandaise.  The sausage I ordered was overcooked pretty badly.  It had a very tough exterior like it perhaps had been re-heated in the deep fryer and they left it too long.   Lastly, my pumpkin pancakes; they were pretty good, but very heave and rich.  I only ate half of the eggs benedict, one pancake, my sausage and about two or three bites of my mountain of double ordered potatoes and I wasn't able to eat anymore.  I don't know if I was full or simply put-off.   Please understand this, nothing was bad, it just wasn't what I was looking for.  The people are very friendly, the place is clean, but for me, it's the food taste/preparation that trumps all of those things."}
{"text":"The place was really nice. The food is half star better then IHOP. The breakfast potatoes were way to seasoned and spicy. It kind of killed the appetite. For morning something that hot only calls trouble for the rest of the day. The food was not anything special that will wow me to hurry back. As I said the place is good but maybe they need a culinary chef."}
{"text":"I've always driven by Grumpy's Cafe and have seen the line out door, so I had to give this place a try! It was a busy place, but within waiting 5 minutes at Grumpy's waiting area, we were seated. We were seated in the brightly painted yellow room with a local artist's paintings all around.   Greeted by our server, I ordered the Grumpy's Special with scrambled eggs, sausage, and wheat bread. Our food came promptly and was indeed delicious! The cajun potatoes were a tad bit spicy, but it was right up my alley! I even added a bit of hot sauce on the side for dipping. For anyone who doesn't like spicy foods, the potatoes might not be something you would want to order. Everything else tasted wonderful! I was so satisfied with the service. I will definitely be back and I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good ol' grumpy's! We love bragging on this place. Every time we have guests stay in Cleveland with us, we take them to Grumpy's. Great menu and impressive service. The place is small, and be ready to wait on a weekend morning, but it's worth it... and the wait is never too long. I've tried several items on the menu at this point, but my favorite has to be the eggs benedict. Favorite part of the restaurant? The \"mystery mug\" as we have decided to tag it. They must recycle un-wanted or used mugs because their always different."}
{"text":"The name says it all... the most grumpy servers and atmosphere on the planet. This place could be great of the employees would get some personalities."}
{"text":"Fresh, fast, and friendly! This cafe was a cross between cafe/diner. The food was so fresh. I had chicken salad on fresh wheat bread. Chicken salad was light and yummy. Cozy seating. I loved the back room decor. My son enjoyed the house made mac and cheese. He was able to choose the cheese and added bacon to it. He couldn't even finish the whole thing. He's 15 and definitely has a hardy appetite. That says a lot about portions. I also hap a cup of the French onion soup. It was so fresh. I loved that they added rye croutons. It gave the soup even more layers of flavor. Loved Grumpy's."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast! Byob so it was fun to bring champagne to make mimosas! Would recommend eggs Benedict!"}
{"text":"Best brunch in Cleveland is a bold claim, and I just said it. Absolutely delicious breakfast. I had been going back and forth between the Grumpy's classic and the breakfast burrito (side note- I had the brilliant idea of introducing Chipotle to breakfast burritos a few years ago, but then saw some documentary on them and apparently they're not interested. I don't get it). Anyways. I realized the Grumpy's classic would (for just $7) give me 4 unique things to eat- eggs my way, bacon (or other breakfast meat, although I don't know why you'd choose anything else), home fries and toast, so I went with that.  I'm a firm believer that if you like your bacon soft, you're soft. Thankfully, the bacon was nice and crispy. Everything else was delicious. I added chocolate chip pancakes as a side. Hopefully that saying \"moment on the lips, forever on the hips,\" isn't true. If it is though, those pancakes were still well worth it.   Quick, friendly service. They even sent me with a to-go cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Grumpy's Cafe is a great little diner in Tremont. This review is about their breakfast, I never really enjoyed their lunches, so I'll leave that out.    Cheap, delicious breakfast at a price that won't break the bank. I've had many dishes here but recently have been having the eggs Benedict with bacon instead of ham. It's always delicious.    Packed to the gills on weekend with townies and suburbanites."}
{"text":"My boss and I decided to order some take out for brunch. Being that the place had a really long wait for dine in, I was curious to see how fast they would get out a pick up order. My boss got off the phone and it was ready in 15 min, when he returned the food was the perfect temp and delicious!   I had the Heuvos Rancheros (I'm sure i spelled that wrong lol)...When I opened the box there was what looked like a quesadilla with a tortilla on the bottom, the black bean hash in the middle and 2 eggs on top with a dash of salsa across the eggs. There were also 4 slices of avocado. The combination was fantastic. Not too bad for the price."}
{"text":"I could eat here everyday of my life! The jambalaya omelet is the best dish I've ever tasted. I hate that this restaurant is always so busy, but I understand why it is. The food is awesome, the service is awesome, the decor is awesome!"}
{"text":"Great service for girl like me visiting from Texas. Kim was awesome!! Definitely a great spot for a homely brunch meal. Cute atmosphere also. I had the Grumpy's Special with the pumpkin spice pancakes. Lots of food for a great & affordable price."}
{"text":"We almost never go out to breakfast except on vacations.  While up from Cincinnati for a long Cleveland weekend, we saw that Grumpy's was just a few minutes from our downtown hotel.  The hotel itself had one of those dining areas that was almost comically sterile and generic--and overpriced--so there was no way we were dining there.  Cincinnati's a crappy breakfast town.  There just aren't that many options outside of the chains, and most of the ones that do serve breakfast food make you wait for brunch hours, which we don't do. (Some folks down here even get all geeked up about this chain called First Watch, which to me is little more than a Denny's with a few California-cuisine pretensions.)  Anyway, by these standards, Grumpy's is pretty good.  Brightly colored decor, relatively cheery atmosphere and service (notwithstanding the restaurant name), reasonable prices, and, on this visit, competent if uninspired breakfast food.  Breakfast burrito came with a nice spicy chorizo, but the meat pretty much overwhelmed the salsa or any other flavor.  Home fries were probably above average, but not by much.  The wife reported that the blueberry pancakes were terrific--better than almost any she had had other than her mom's (which suggests they were pretty great).  After too many beers at the ballyard the night before, coffee wasn't going to agree with me, so I can't report on that.    Based on our experience, the two-star reviews seem pretty harsh. I'd say that, if it Grumpy's was nothing to write home about, it wasn't bad at all and would actually be a pretty nice option back home."}
{"text":"We came for brunch and had the vegetarian benedicts. They were great -- good potatoes on the side, nice serving of hollandaise on the eggs, which were cooked perfectly.   This is kind of a 'family' place which means that it's loud, full of kids, and a little messy. But it was good vibes. People were leaving happy and full.   It's in an old house or business storefront or something, which makes for a nice if crowded space. Prices were fair. Our big complaint was that our iced tea was really bad, and their hot tea assortment was poor. But this isn't a cafe so take those with a grain of salt.   Service is a little coarse, but this isn't fine dining, it's a quality sandwich and breakfast spot. Recommended."}
{"text":"I was looking for a reasonably priced place for breakfast for a large party of 7 when I came across this restaurant. We arrived on a Sunday around 10:00 and it was packed with a waitlist starting to form. We checked in with the hostess and was told we would have a 30 min wait which was to be expected. Before I left the stand, I was asked to give my cell so that they could text me when our table was ready. After about 20 min's, the hostess came to get us because I did not respond to the text that was sent. I accidentally put my phone on vibrate, so I was very thankful that she came to find us instead of moving on to the next large group.  The menu had a lot of options for adults and kids. We ordered a variety of food to include pumpkin spice and chocolate chip pancakes and everything was good. My fiancee loved the breakfast tacos. The turkey sausage was good as were their potatoes.  Before we left, we took some fresh baked chocolate chip cookies to go and they were delicious!  By the time we left, there were a lot of people waiting for a table. The staff was so nice and the food was very good, so it was easy to see why Grumpy's is so popular."}
{"text":"Nothing that is amazing here but the breakfast is not to bad. I like the interior a lot and the patio is small but cute. The service has always been great!"}
{"text":"Ehhh, it was fine.  Extremely small waiting area despite continued volume (build on seems necessary, or take away a few tables in the front).  Everyone raves about it but it's not that tasty or unique.  Staff is nice."}
{"text":"full disclosure.....went here one time, good diner food...reasonably priced.... and I am giving this 5 stars simply because of some of the bizarre reviews I have read, especially the one from \"brittany', who ended up writing a virtual short story trashing this poor establishment.  She is complaining about what a tragedy it is for 'quick buck artists', blah blah blah....... I can assure you folks, the people running this diner are not rolling in dough, in fact they are probably just getting by.  If she or others have to wait it is because the place is crowded with people who obviously CAME BACK FOR MORE!  The hostess wasn't rude.... nothing personal Brittany, but she is probably at her wits end dealing with snark jobs like you.  I support local. I support small establishments like this..... and it really pains me to write a bad review because everybody has to bad night or two in their lives....right???  So, 5 stars for this little place to make up for some of these bull____t reviews."}
{"text":"My recent lunch here left me a bit underwhelmed, but their breakfast is still 100% awesome.   I started with their taco soup special--I know, it sounds weird, and I have to admit I was skeptical. But the waitress said it was delicious and I trusted her. I was good, a lot like a creamy tortilla soup, but with ground beef. It didn't knock my socks off, but it was definitely tasty.   Next I tried the spicy chicken Caesar salad. It came with cajun spiced grilled chicken strips, roasted corn, tortillas, tomatoes, cucumbers and a light, chipotle Caesar dressing. Then, they drizzled the whole thing with BBQ sauce. Well, I'll tell ya--I could have done without the drizzle of overly sweet BBQ sauce, but that's just my personal taste. The salad had almost too much going on with that addition, but it was still pretty good.   Overall, their lunch is a 3 star, but their breakfast is really where it's at!"}
{"text":"My family and I went out to Grumpys for lunch.  It's one of my favorite breakfast places in town. Enjoy the Tremont location and there's a parking lot, although it can be tricky to get a spot during peak hours.  I didn't love my meal this time around, but I have had some fantastic pancakes and omelets here before. This time I got the sweet potato pancakes with maple BBQ drizzle.  I should've known the BBQ taste would overpower the dish for me, but I don't blame them for that. Everyone else enjoyed their meal.  It's a kid friendly place and they have a waiting room that's sort of outside, but heated. Service has always been good. It's just busy on the weekends but I think it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I had to see what all the fuss was about this acclaimed top 5 brunch spot on cleveland. The place was packed to the brim Sunday late morning,  good sign.   I got The Grumpys Special (scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, buttermilk pancakes). I paired it with a side of corn beef hash and coffee. My girlfriend had a veggie omlette with a coffee.  Ill get to the food but hats off for tremendous service.  Despite the place being packed our waitress never made us feel that way. Coffee was always full,  and she even insisted on getting me a new napkin when mine dropped on the floor. Not necessary but still appreciated.  Eggs and bscon can't go wrong,  ditto on the pancakes. The corn beef hash was MAD GOOD BRO, very savory, not overly greasy.  The place has a good vibe, plenty of interior pieces of art to look at too, and what appears to be a great staff!"}
{"text":"Brunch is unbelievable  got the sweet potato pancakes and breakfast burrito and was immediately satisfied. Gets packed in there but the service was great despite it being so busy in the morning.   You're not a Clevelander until you try their breakfast. Thanks Grumpy's...don't go anywhere"}
{"text":"Hands down favorite brunch place on the west side.  Sausage, biscuits and gravy are the way to gooooo.... Some of the staff at Grumpy's is a little, well, grumpy.  But they're efficient, they keep your coffee cup full, and the food is yummers.  I sure wish they would consider extending their hours into the wee mornings again....that was grand, and something Tremont definitely needs.  But, great food, great prices....I make a stop almost every time I'm home."}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about here! I joined a group of coworkers (about 16 of us total) for lunch here one day. We called ahead since we had a large group. When we arrived we waited less than 15 minutes & the hostess asked if it would be okay if we sat at two tables so we could be seated faster. We were okay with this and it worked out just fine. The restaurant was pretty busy for a weekday afternoon but the service was fast and friendly! My water glass stayed full and all of our lunches came out around the same time. Everyone in my group seemed to be enjoying their food. I ordered tomato bisque & the apple walnut salad with chicken. It was very delicious, with fresh vibrant ingredients and a house made vinaigrette. Lastly, it's good to know they offer private parking! Certainly a plus since that's rare in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Food was awesome!!! Huge portions French toast OMG and the hash browns where should I begin. A must try."}
{"text":"I love Grumpy's. It's definitely my go-to for a great breakfast. It's just like having breakfast at home with mix-matched coffee cups and all. Service is always good, food comes out hot and they usually get you in and out fairly quickly. My only complaint is that they need a bigger location. It can be a tight squeeze especially on a Saturday/Sunday morning."}
{"text":"I got breakfast here once, some sort of pecan pancakes that I think I remember liking?, but besides that no other visits until recently when I wanted to check out their \"Anti-fish fry\". The dinner contained lightly breaded and grilled haddock, herb roasted potatoes, southwest slaw ($13), side of 3 pierogies with grilled onions ($3), and a side of broth like clam chowder ($3). And of course tartar sauce and sour cream were included. Overall I think it was a good dinner, the potatoes were a bit lackluster and I would have preferred mac & cheese, but no big complaints and I liked their unique take on the clam chowder.   I'd say this place is a solid 3.5, but I am not going to round up until I try a few more of their offerings."}
{"text":"Husband and I went for brunch Sunday morning around 11am. It was completely packed, as expected, but the hostess was super friendly and got us seated right away. Huge menu and everything looked great. I had the Greek Omelet and my husband got the Walker Hash. Both delicious and the service was awesome! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food. Slow service. They have a nice variety of offerings.  The walls adorn local art for sale. Sunday is busy but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I went to Grumpy's a few weeks ago for brunch with a friend as part of our monthly meal. I have driven past and seen this place packed before so I was prepared to wait a while. Originally they had told me 20 minutes, but it was actually a lot quicker than that which was nice. They have a huge menu so it took my friend and I awhile to decide on our orders. I ended up going with the veggie benedict which came with home fries. It was nice that you could choose plain or cajun home fries, which I was not expecting, because I am not a big spicy fan. Overall I just thought the food was alright, nothing special. Maybe I have to try something else because so many people love this place. The price was not bad, but it seemed like your typical breakfast restaurant to me."}
{"text":"We were seated immediately around 11am on a Tuesday. The hostess was friendly and so was our attentive server Leia. The coffee was hot and so was the food. We ordered the grumpys breakfast and a breakfast wrap and they were awesome. It didnt take very long to get the food either.  We had our check while we were eating which was convenient too. Grumpy's was awesome we will definitely come back. The cajun hashbrowns are the best ever!"}
{"text":"Sunday is for brunching and next up on the selection this week was Grumpys Cafe. I've passed this place millions of times so today was the day to give it a try. This place gets very busy so I'd suggest getting a reservation or getting there early.  The menu has a good selection of choices to choose from and you get a fairly good serving of food on your plate. I ordered the smothered French toast with turkey sausage on the side. The French toast is made with wheat bread I must say it's very good. In addition you get strawberries and sweet cream on top. I recommend asking for some additional syrup to add on the side. The turkey sausage was your typical sausage patty. I recommend this place for a good brunch spot on Sunday or Saturday or whenever. I went in Grumpys , grumpy and left Happy with the choice."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and enjoyed it both times. The pancakes and potatoes are great, omelette was pretty good too, our service was pretty fast, very attentive, the front room is a little crowded and there's no decent waiting area but it has decent Parking for the location and good food."}
{"text":"Go here for brunch! The food is quite good, the service is excellent, and the ambiance is your classic diner joint with a bit of added flair.   While the place is packed on the weekend, the tables turn over quickly and you can wait either outside or on the enclosed patio, where they have complimentary coffee. They let you bring your own alcohol, which luckily one of my friends had known about, so we brought a bottle of champagne for mimosas. Immediately upon being seated the waitress offered to bring out an ice bucket to chill our champagne and fresh orange juice. I was already sold.   For the food, the portions were sizeable and everything was tasty. Most of it was your traditional breakfast food, with a few mixup offerings for the more adventurous. Everyone at my table was quite satisfied and the service was excellent throughout the whole meal."}
{"text":"Driving around to The Christmas House we passed this place, saw good reviews and decided to try it.  The menu is vast with lots of great items on it, the food was served quickly and was delicious, the waitstaff was very friendly and attentive.  We love the ambiance of this cute little place and will drive there again for sure!  So worth the stop!!"}
{"text":"The Atmosphere: Charming The Menu: Very Promising The Food: Extremely Disappointing!  I ordered the Mediterranean Flat Bread and it was ok. I also ordered the Vegetable Stir Fry and I almost laughed when the waitress brought it to my table. It looked (and tasted) like something I would throw together at home if I had some random veggies that were about to turn. The sauce seemed to be store bought and the rice was undercooked.   Grumpy's is in a good location near many other restaurants. I would recommend trying one of those nearby eateries. :)"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch with my coworkers. We came here since it was the only one open during weekday lunch. I ordered the Cajun catfish which was pretty good, just wasn't all that delicious. The fish itself tasted pretty fresh, I just didn't like the sauce they put on top, so I just scraped it to the side. The rice and good, but the chicken that they cooked was really dry, so I didn't eat that. The cafe itself is really quaint and comfortable. The servers and waitresses were very hospitable and friendly, making sure our waters were refilled and that we were enjoying ourselves."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews and visiting Grumpys several times for both brunch and dinner, I think there is a system to ordering from their menu.  Grumpys does a really good job on the basics.  Their pancakes, omelets and corned beef hash are delicious.  But they're also basic dishes that are not difficult to make.  Grumpy's puts their own twist on them and they taste delicious.  Same with dinner. Their soups are all made from scratch and healthy.  Their specials can be hit or miss, again I stick with down home dishes.   The service is always personable and I always feel right at home when I walk in the door."}
{"text":"Stopped in randomly on a Tuesday around 12:30pm. I trusted my fellow Yelpers and was extremely disappointed.   Crowded, uncomfortable atmosphere. Felt like there was no air conditioning on when it was 85+ degrees that day.   Ordered the W14th special, and the corned beef hash was awful. Now I usually like spice, but man something was off on this. Tasted really fatty too, unlike others that I have tried.   Mom ordered regular pancakes, bacon, and eggs, and was underwhelmed as well.  Plus, the prices are higher than other joints in the area. I've had great breakfast food around Cleveland for under $10. Clearly you are paying for the local at Grumpy's. The only thing I truly enjoyed was the Cleveland artwork in the place.   I would much rather head to Joe's in Rocky River for some good corned beef hash.   Sorry Grumpy's, I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"LOVED this place!!   Super cute decor, amazing food & awesome service.  Came here for Sunday brunch and it was truly a treat.  I had the blueberry pancakes (YUM), the Cajun hash browns were to diiiiiie for! Other people I was with got the breakfast sandwich and jambalaya omelet, which they loved as well. The corn beef hash was BOMB as well.   Def going to be a normal breakfast spot for the weekends"}
{"text":"I had heard that the brunch here was great so we decided to try it out. We were told a 20 min wait which we were fine with, they then proceeded to send us outside on the patio with about 20 other people waiting. Closed confined areas tend to make me slightly uncomfortable but we were able to find a seat and chill out.  At least it was heated as it was cold that morning, they also had coffee out there as well.  It felt odd they just kept shoving people out on the patio to wait yet I guess better than the alternative of waiting outside.  We waited about 30 min and were seated. Our server was awesome, very attentive and quick. We had already looked over the menu so we were quick to order. Food times were quick for how busy they were 15 min from ordering we had our food. Corned beef hash omelette was delish and huge. My boyfriend got the breakfast burrito said it was good but nothing special.  I would return and try again for sure maybe next time try to get there a little earlier to beat the rush."}
{"text":"Open on New Year's Day. Yeah!   Plus it was really good, even though I've never seen a Greek Omelet made with Swiss Cheese.  Where's the Feta?  I liked they had different fun Christmas mugs instead of same old, same old.   Grumpy's even makes sure their waiting customers have a hot cup of coffee in hand.  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I visited Grumpys and thought it was a cool little establishment. The service was excellent and the atmosphere was spot on.   Busy busy busy! The food was ok. The eggs Benedict had an odd taste. Too much mustard in the the holindaise sauce. Other then that, it was great!  Chocolate chip pancakes were wicked good and perfectly done. All in all, it was a good experience. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Was in Cleveland for the weekend and did a search for best breakfast and found Grumpy's. Arrived and was told it would be a 20 minute wait, so we waited and were called right at 20 minutes. Once we were seated, it was another 35 minute wait, and still no food. Asked our server and she said there were some large groups in the back and it would be a while longer, hopefully in another 5-10 minutes.  Yikes! 20 + 35 and still no food. I trust the reviews that the food is good, but I don't think any restaurant should seat more customers than the kitchen can cook for. The table across from us got their breakfast for free because the wait was so long. So we left. An hour in, no food in sight-nope. Nobody is that good. On another note, when we were seated, there were two glasses of water on the table-we didn't know if it was for us, or left over from the last people. I prefer to see my food brought to the table-not something left there for the customer to wonder about its origin."}
{"text":"I do like grumpy's. It's a solid breakfast spot when you're hankering for some eggs and home fries.   Friendly service,  pieces of stained glass and art hung for display/sale, and a smattering of breakfast items. What's not to like?   Food-wise, I'm not really blown away. Last time I was here I ordered the Literary omelette. It was packed with sausage, bell peppers, onions, which was awesome. But then, it was covered in american cheese, which I could have done without, or had less of. The home fries are pretty bomb-diggity. Nice and crispy, and if I wasn't mistaken, a little spicy also!   They were very accommodating with our large group. A+ for service."}
{"text":"What a great breakfast!!!  First of all, the decor was awesome. We sat at the Lebron James table!!  The food was delicious. Everyone loved what they had except the one who ordered chocolate chip pancakes, she thought they were fair -- but, she still gave the breakfast an \"A\"  The coffee was good and the servers were nice.   We would recommend this place to anyone!   I had the walnut apple French toast and it was delicious. My son in law had the stuffed French toast and he said it was the best French toast he has ever had.   I am going to post pictures!!"}
{"text":"Went to Grumpy's for a late lunch. We had poor service. The waitress was unfriendly and seemed to be in a hurry to rush us out of the place. The lunch menu was very limited. I ordered meatloaf because it's hard to screw up meatloaf right? Wrong! It was way over- spiced and tasted awful. My friend had a steak sandwich which was pretty good though. The only reason I rated the place a 2 vs a 1 is based on the atmosphere. Wouldn't go back!"}
{"text":"Went to Grumpy's for brunch and had the porky omelette with cajun fries and rye toast. It was the epitome of comfort food. Large serving size and generous amounts of moist pulled pork and bacon stuffed inside a fluffy egg receptacle. The rye toast was also well buttered and melted deliciously in my mouth.  Grumpy's had the comfort and service of a diner with better quality food and ambiance. Will definitely be going back. Also awesome that they serve all day brunch on saturday and sunday so you do not have to wake up early to get your hangover cure!"}
{"text":"my wife and I were looking for a place to eat breakfast somewhere around the Christmas story house. what we found is grumpys cafe. this place was awesome and I'd recommend the breakfast burrito. also the Cajun home fries are great if you like spicy food. grumpys seams  to be a popular breakfast spot it's artsy and hipster as well. but if your hungry and looking to kill time before or after you hang out with ralfie Parker grumpys is a good spot."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with my mom and since it is almost Christmas I could still get the buicuits and gravy. Excellent and highly recommended.  My mom had the corned beef hash.  It was warm and inviting inside. They were busy and service was a little slow but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I was VERY pleased with Grumpy's! Every single person we encountered that worked there was friendly and warm. I had the Chicken Philly and my date had a breakfast platter. We both throughly enjoyed our food. Flavorful, fresh, and hot. The small patio was perfectly cozy. Meal was affordable. This is definitely a good spot to try while in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I really don't understand why people are still talking about Lucky's when there's Grumpy's in the same neighborhood and it's SOOO much better.  I highly recommend the Grumpy's Special.  Two eggs how you like them (scrambled with American cheese!), Cajun home fries (so, so good), toast (I don't know where they get their bread, but its amazing), choice of breakfast meat and for 2-3 extra bucks you can add buttermilk or flavored pancakes (blueberry or pumpkin pancakes are my recommendation).  Oh yeah, the prices are exceptionally fair.  The basic Grumpy's special is $4.99.  They serve the coffee in old school mugs you'd likely find in your parent's cabinet.  On a Sunday, be prepared to wait, but I promise, it is definitely worth it!  The service has always been great and no matter how busy they are, the servers always stop to say hi and smile.  My only complaint is on a busy weekend, the hostess can be pretty inefficient in seating people.  While waiting in the cold I watched a two seat table remain empty for 25 minutes!!  That is really the only reason I give this place a 4 out of 5 rating."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, great place for breakfast and brunch. I recently went to Grumpy's with a group of 5 and the food and service was great. If you have to wait for a table, which you likely will on the weekends, there is a great heated outdoor patio with free coffee to keep you warm while you wait. The staff was friendly and extremely attentive. We had absolutely no issues even during a busy Saturday. The food is simple but delicious. If you're looking for a sophisticated boozy brunch, this isn't the place for you. It's a more laid back simpler menu. I will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Grumpy's did, in fact, the opposite on my last visit here a few weeks ago. I left fat, full and actually very happy.    When I lived in Cleveland I used to go quite a bit to get a nice breakfast and sip coffee while catching up with girlfriends. Not much has changed. And they still serve a mean pancake! Pumpkin being my favorite.  This time around I took in more of the ambiance here, admiring the quirky artwork, using the free wifi and overall, just feeling comfortable, settled and taken care of.  A couple things irked me on my trip back that tainted my memories, but truthfully, it was nothing that would keep me from coming back. Go here, order some breakfast, drink five cups of coffee, and surf the net to leave happier than you did when you walked in."}
{"text":"Breakfast was on point! Best corned beef hash I've ever had! Great restaurant, great food, great prices! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Spending a night at The Christmas Story House, we stopped here for breakfast the following morning, and we are glad we did!  Friendly folks and good food!  If I lived here, I'd keep coming back until I ate the menu.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It's sad to see that restaurants cut corners just to make and extra buck.  As you may know my reviews are very honest and long and I don't mind telling the truth. I promise, Gumpy's cafe lives up to their name. Get cozy and and I'll tell you all about my grumpy experience.   Walking into to this place there is nothing much to look at as far as decor but I will say that the eye is entertained by perhaps a local artist's artwork and photography (a long with tacky handwritten price tags, but no big deal). My boyfriend and I stood at the counter for a full two minutes waiting for some to acknowledge us reading specials on a white board and finally a woman comes up and she said, \"hi\" and just stood there. Maybe I'm not use to being the person that speaks up but I though she would say something like, \" Hi. How are you today? And Can I get you guys seated today? Inside or outside?\" Yeah, there was none of those options just, hi. So, I said, \"table for two.\"We where seated by a window (aawwwww how nice) and given our menus. The menu was small but had a decent selection of food, I was torn between perogies and nachos with Texas caviar. The waitress came back and asked us what we wanted to drink. It would have been nice if our waitress asked us if we had ever been here before but she didn't and we haven't so I asked her what where the choices ( I asked bc drinks wasn't on the menu and I really wanted a ice cold beer that day but...) so with kind of a rushed attitude like I should know or something, she rattled off coke, water, coffee, ice tea and lemonade I opted for lemonade and my boyfriend decided to break away from his healthy routine and have a Coke. As soon as she came back with our drinks she asked us if we were ready to order and I still had not decided on what I wanted yet. There were not mentions or suggestions about the specials they had that day. We told her we needed a few more minutes. In our wait I noticed FLIES! And I hate flies  they were all over the window, we were trying to swat them away from us, no one noticed. Every time we killed one, two more would come back.   Finally I opted for Nachos to be on the safe side and my boyfriend ordered the Rhino burger. It was quite a long wait and what I couldn't understand was why had a couple that had been seated minutes after us being served and I ordered the same thing the guy had. And I was not at all impressed by what I saw but who's to say they wouldn't be the best nachos ever.  Grump'y Nachos: When my nachos finally came out I was disgusted! I love, love, love, nachos but this was some bullsh*t! Why the hell would they even put this garbage on the menu?  \"Corn chips smothered with chorizo.\" The corn chips were baged and store bought. Not a big deal and I'm sure the red white and blue colors were patriotic. \"Smothered in chorizo?\" No! More like sprinkled chorizo there was nothing smothered about that and my nachos were bone dry. I had never heard of Texas caviar but it was described to me by our waitress as a three bean salad, gross! But I said, \"hey let me try it.\"   It was gross, it looked as if someone pored a little bit of canned kidney beans, black beans and chickpeas over it and melted shredded cheddar cheese on top of it. Who ever's Ideal it was to disgrace Texas but calling it \"Texas caviar\" good job! Please rename it trash and do away with it as soon as possible.   For those of you who cook, you should know that if you microwave shredded cheese on a tortilla chip then the cheese is going to burn onto the chip if you leave it on long enough. Plain and simple, if your going to be that cheap, at least make it taste a little bit better with can con queso  cheese or any cheese in a can that melts...** hint, hint not yo' cheese but nacho cheese, (corny but that was funny), lol.   Last but not least, my baby's infamous Rhino Burger...  Why? Okay wait, why in the hell is it called a Rhino burger? There was nothing exotic or tasty about this burger but before I completely throw it under the bus and reverse on it like road kill, I will say that it took away the puke taste of the Grumpy nacho's I had. In his own words, \"it reminded him of a dry sloppy Jo.\" Mind you this delicious burger was suppose to have salsa on it and it was also severed with yet another Texas theme, Texas toast, with an extra dollop of butter to kill ya!   Bottom line this place was not worth eating at and I will never ever, go back."}
{"text":"Potatoes undercooked and eggs Benedict leaving a lot to be desired. Iced coffee was eh.  Atmosphere is great but kitchen needs help."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, I had French toast and hash browns, loved the hot sauce they had available on the tables. Wasn't thrilled about waiting 55 minutes after our expected wait was only 30 minutes, but it was Sunday brunch. The woman who took our drink orders was not the most pleasant. I asked about the type of tomato juice they served, and she got really snippy with me, all I wanted to know was if it was served from a can. Although, the lady that took our actual order was very nice. Food was prompted, but our coffee or drinks were never refilled :( I would probably go back, just when they are less busy."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome for breakfast or dinner! The corned beef hash is amazing!! :)"}
{"text":"This place can get pretty crowded and they'll only seat you if your whole party is there so make sure your whole group is together. The food is amazing! I had the walker hash which has sausage mixed with hash and cheese and eggs over easy running down it! It's got a little kick and is great. I split a side of chocolate chip pancakes which were just as delicious and satisfied my sweet tooth craving.  The artwork rotates every so often. This time they had pictures of dogs  some that were dressed up funny .   The service is good with lots of coffee and water refills. Also parking is available in the lot next door which does fill up so you may need to search for something on the street. Overall great time!"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere of the place. It's friendly, inviting and it seems clean. We sat by the window and the server came and greated us shortly. We got coffee in Christmas cups which I appreciated I am not going to lie, I find joy in the silly things.  Over all the experience was great. I ordered the steak and mushroom omelet but I got the corned beef hash one instead. I didn't mind because I do love anything corned beef hash and I am not usually picky. I didn't want fries or toast so I got grilled veggies instead. They were really good."}
{"text":"Brunching in Cleveland this weekend. Grumpys Cafe hit the spot with their vast menu and Cajun home fries. Hubby and I shared the literary omlet (sausage, peppers and onions) and breakfast burrito (sausage, egg and cheese) both came with their signature Cajun home fries and homemade hot sauce. They have a lot of seating options and great coffee!! Thank you for curing my breakfast pang"}
{"text":"Solid food and friendly waiters. A bit of an awkward layout, but that's common in Tremont and they clearly need to maximize space because they're popular! My omelet was decent. I'd give any other omelet 3 stars but they have lots of options with chorizo so 4 it is! My friend loved her breakfast sandwich, so I wouldn't mind going back to try that or one of their burritos.   Protip: you can exchange the fries for something else. I don't much care for potatoes, so I appreciated the opportunity to get a bowl of fruit instead."}
{"text":"What a cool, different place. I had a jambalaya omelette with cajun homefries...absolutely delicious. My only complaint is it listed shrimp as an ingredient and there was literally one shrimp on top of the omelette as garnish. Would have loved to have shrimp actually in the jambalaya.   My son had the grumpy's special breakfast, your standard breakfast with pancakes. The pancakes were delicious, I snuck a bite. He loved the whole meal and ate most of it.   The ambience is great, there's cool art all over the walls and the coffee mugs are all old goofy coffee mugs. This will definitely be a must stop every time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"A totally acceptable, tasty place for brunch, though you may have a bit of a wait.  I've had an omelet every time I've been and it's always solid the service is acceptable.  If you're in the mood for brunch and in the area a totally reasonable place."}
{"text":"Bad service and tables filled with dirties set me off to a bad start upon my visit to Grumpy's. That coupled with the breakfast burrito with an unripened avocado that I sent back didn't help matters much. The decor was nice, but the place felt dirty and a bit pricey for what you get. I won't be back."}
{"text":"There's nothing grumpy about Grumpy's. Its a cute little place with excellent service and quick service. Any Clevelander will surely have Grumpy's on their short list of local brunch spots. Grumpy's is located on a main street in Tremont, so its easy to find for people not familiar with the area.  First off... super busy! Every little table was packed. I had the Eggs Benedict with a side of fruit. My friend had the skillet with sausage. I stole a bite of it and it was totally delicious! Next time, I will probably get that. My Benedict was fine, but her skillet was really tasty. Our food came out fast and our server was helpful and nice. The trip was so quick that I don't have any revolutionary observations. Fast breakfast is OK with me.  Plan your trip accordingly, because Grumpy's undoubtedly fills up quickly during peak hours. The prices are really inexpensive, so you'll find a lot of groups flocking here. It has a homey vibe and good food, so come grab breakfast and relax. Also, something pretty nice for Tremont: They have their own small parking lot attached if you can find a spot. Woot woot!"}
{"text":"Grumpy's has a great omelet. The sides (homefries & toast) were average. Wished the home fries were crisper - they were soggy and lifeless next to my fresh omelet. I really liked the decor and atmosphere with festive art on the walls. Our food did take quite a while to get to our table but our waitress made sure to keep our coffee cups filled."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for almost a decade. The food is great and inexpensive. I love the local art."}
{"text":"The food was okay, nothing really spectacular. The fruit I got was old, and the service could have been better. I liked the building and all of the local artwork though."}
{"text":"I went to Grumpy's on a busy Sunday morning, expecting the worst after reading reviews from other Yelpers.  Was my service super fast?  No.  But it was adequate for a Sunday morning in a breakfast-y type restaurant with a waiting line out the door.  Patience, my friends.  Good breakfast food is not meant to be rushed.  I had a cup of coffee and the pumpkin pancakes.  My server kept the refills coming and my pancakes were really good.  I'm not much of a breakfast eater, but I was pleased with my meal.  My dining companions liked their walnut french toast and apple pancakes, too.  If you're in Tremont and in the mood for a non-rushed meal, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Love this place for brunch ! Their pancake and chocolate french toast is excellent! 5 Star for spicy potato.. Loving it!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with how quickly this placed moved for hot busy it was - on a Monday. I'd say my mom and I strolled in around 10 am and the restaurant was pretty full. My mom got the eggs florentine and I got the breakfast tacos. I really wish the tacos came with a hard or soft shell option because the flour tortilla can make things a little bland. My mom loved hers.   The most recent time I came I got the Mexican omelet and an orange juice. One of life's most pressing questions is why is juice always so expensive?! Three dollars for a medium cup of orange juice?!  There has to be someone out there hoarding and inflating the prices on the orange juice exchange.   I feel like breakfast here is solid. It is a little pricier than I think it should be (said and done a coffee entree and tip will run you close to $18-20 a person) but all is fair in love and war I suppose. The last time I was here they seemed to have shrieked the menu which was disappointed. All around an okay stop.  Service wise my first server was memorable and my second one was more under the radar. I really like the local artwork here. I'd come again but I think I want to explore my breakfast horizons a little more before I come back."}
{"text":"Finally resisted my urge to go to Lucky's in order to try that other brunch place in Tremont that everyone seems to talk about.  Grumpy's is larger, cheaper and has vastly more menu options than Lucky's.  It's also a bigger place (though the tables are slightly too close for comfort), so there isn't much of a wait.  Most of the food on their menu I found is your typical brunch fare - omelets, pancakes and the such. I had the Grumpy's special (eggs, meat, toast, and pancakes) with pumpkin pancakes.  The pumpkin flavor in the pancake did not come out for me, though my girlfriend could taste it.  She ordered an omelet, which had two slices of American cheese slopped over the top - which she proceeded to remove - otherwise, it's a pretty typical omelet.  Their cajun homefries were overwhelmingly spicy and a bit soggy, so we didn't finish them.    All in all, this place is cheap, but also pretty typical and nothing too memorable.  Maybe we'll come back again if we decide we don't want to wait the 40 minutes at Lucky's."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious diner food! I love coming here for weekend brunch - for the price you pay, you get A TON of food. I was pleasantly surprised by the sweet potato pancake, it was actually really tasty. I normally only ever get chocolate chip pancakes, so this was a good option. I've had the huevos rancheros, Walker hash, and the corned beef hash -  all have been very tasty! The corned beef hash was a little too salty when I tried it, I don't know if I'd order it again. The Cajun home fries are really great but sometimes too spicy, I guess it depends on who is in the kitchen. All in all, it's a wonderful brunch experience and I love coming here on the weekends. They don't take reservations, just as a heads up."}
{"text":"Best no frills breakfast around! Grumpys has great, simple food. Their special gets you Cajun homefries, eggs, bacon, and toast for about $6. Add a couple dollars for 2 huge pancakes and you have the best all American breakfast imaginable. The Cajun homefries are a staple and come with just about everything you order - and they're very, very flavorful!   Friendly service, nice patio, great coffee, and cool pictures from local artists available for purchase sum up the rest of Grumpy's. They definitely have something for everyone and I am looking forward to trying the other things they have to offer (if I can pry myself away from the chocolate chip pancakes special!) Also fun that they use mugs from random companies/organizations, nice touch."}
{"text":"Wow. So my mom and I were so excited to try this place. We talked for months about coming (she lives in Brunswick and doesn't get down to the Tremont area often). And finally, it happened. We made time to go, and I'm freaking happy we did.   I was promptly greeted on a Saturday morning with a cup of coffee by our server, which is crucial. There was no wait for two, we sat right away. I had such a hard time deciding on what to order, everything on the menu sounded incredible. I settled for a breakfast burrito with chorizo and also mad the best decision of my life ordering a sweet potato pancake on the side. Perfectly, amazingly fluffy. With walnuts. And a maple bbq glaze. Oh my god. I'm not sure I could have eaten more than one but that one pancake was perfect. I wish I would have taken pictures except everything was too good. Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"How does Lucky's have a better rating than this place?? Just visited Grumpy's with my family and it was great. The place was super crowded, but we waited just 10 minutes for a table (tip: get there at 10). And even though our server must have been really busy, she was fast, attentive, and didn't get anything wrong or forget anything.  We got the pumpkin pancakes, a Southwest-style omelet, apple-cinnamon pancakes, blueberry pancakes, and I got a chai tea. Every thing was delicious. Grumpy's may not offer as inventive-looking a menu as Lucky's, but when I ate there the food was gross, the servers inattentive, the wait to be seated was long, and they won't let you do any substitutions or changes. Lucky's was pretty much the complete opposite.  Delicious food, great service, good prices, good variety on the menu. Maybe if the menu got a tiny bit more inventive I'd bump this up to a perfect 5 stars. Still, this is your brunch place."}
{"text":"Great food! We were heading home to Columbus and wanted to grab brunch. The place was packed but we only waited about 10 minutes for a table. There were 5 of us and 3 of us got the Grumpy Special and then 2 of us (myself) got the breakfast tacos. Everything was awesome! Our waitress super nice and it was a all around great experience. Will definitely go back! Didn't have the pancakes but the table next to us did and they looked heavenly. If they added Bloody Mary's to their menu I might move in."}
{"text":"Love love love Grumpys! Went for brunch on Saturday. It was extremely busy but we were seated within five minutes. The food was amazing, I had the veggie egg skillet and shared the pumpkin pancakes(which were to die for) :) Kathy and Dani(owners) are the best and their staff follow suit! Much love from your neighbor in Tremont"}
{"text":"Bumping up to 5 stars because of the AMAZING biscuits and gravy. Fresh fluffy biscuits topped with a creamy sausage gravy was a little taste of breakfast heaven!   I've been on the hunt for great biscuits and gravy since graduating high school in 2001, yes my high school cafeteria had the best ever (don't judge me!)  FF to new years day 2016 and I finally found them!   I've visited several times and the staff is always great and the food fast and fresh, but now I have a very special reason to come back!"}
{"text":"Looking to spend our evening in Tremont for the monthly walkabout, we put Waldo dog into the car and headed west.  We had no particular restaurant chosen, just needed a place with a dog-friendly patio.  Finding Grumpy's, we asked the employee on the patio (he was the only person seated out there) if they were serving outside.  Absolutely, and he went inside to send a server.  She greeted us, gave us menus, and took our drink order, told us about the day's special, and offered to answer questions.  Meanwhile, the first employee returned with a dog bowl of ice water for Waldo (points from the pooch for this nice surprise!).  My husband had the BBQ Chicken Caesar salad, which he said had a little heat/spice, and I enjoyed my Mojo Pork Tacos; very mild (both the pork and the salsa that came on the side) and the slaw was fresh and flavorful.  Xhuliana provided very good service, and we finished our meal with plenty of time left in the evening to explore the neighborhood a bit."}
{"text":"Grumpy's is a really solid brunch spot. The huevos rancheros are delicious, as is the turkey wrap and eggs benedict. They have solid coffee and the service is always great. A clean and comfortable interior makes for a really nice dining experience. You should definitely give Grumpy's a try!"}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've been to Grumpy's for lunch, but I recently went back for brunch on a Sunday morning. The parking lot was nearly packed so you may have to wait a bit or find street parking.  We got a table for four with relatively no wait, although I feel like this is abnormal based on the number of people flowing in and out and how tight the place is. We had a table right next to the coat rack and ended up having to move the table a couple feet to give our friends enough room.   The food was mixed on opinion for me. I would like to try something a little more complex the next time I visit. I had the breakfast burrito with cajun home fries. I loved the potatoes. The burrito comes with eggs, a meat, and cheese. I chose sausage, but was disappointed when it came as sliced links as opposed to a ground sausage. It just seemed a bit odd to me and I'd like to try something with their chorizo next time. Perhaps I'll do a lunch since it's close to work and I'll report back on that!"}
{"text":"Nosedive alert!   How sad. This once-decent restaurant has gone to pot.  My companion's cheeseburger, ordered medium, came out well done, but no done enough to melt the sprinkle of grated cheddar placed on top of the lettuce.  I ordered the Mexican lasagna. Once layered with Tortillas, cheese and chorizo, it's now simply a glob of chopped chicken and ground beef, between two tortillas, with cheese melted on top, and a cold center.  Sending back for microwaving ensures rubberized chicken, and then it's inedible.  The owner, a really nice lady, has lost her kitchen.  Mass-firing might save Grumpy's, but I doubt it. The crowd is a third of what it used to be. It appears many have already caught on."}
{"text":"Grumpy's is one of my favorite breakfast joints. Period. I have only eaten breakfast or brunch there, so that is all I am going to review.  On the weekends, this is one of the places to go in Tremont. It is busy, but they get people in and out pretty quickly. I usually go with the blueberry pancakes with a side of bacon. Unlike some other places, the blueberries are real blueberries, not the power ones that come out of the jiffy mix box. Also, there are *tons* of blueberries. Have I mentioned I like blueberries?  I will warn you, everything comes with a side of cajun home fries and they always burn a hole in my tongue. If you ask (I usually forget) you can get them non-cajun or substitute fruit.   A pro tip...if there is a long wait, you can usually squeeze in at the bar. And by bar, I mean bar to sit at, not toss back mimosas. Unless you bring your own...the joint is byob, so consider that in your planning.   I drive from the burbs, so you know it must be good."}
{"text":"Always delicious. Always a wait. But let me tell you it is worth it. cannot wait to go back. One of the best brunches in tremont"}
{"text":"Grumpys in Tremont is a fantastic brunch spot. Its a large space, with two separate dining areas conjoined around one kitchen. I failed to remember how difficult it is to get a table for 6 with zero notice on a saturday and just decided to stroll in, and was completely rewarded for my laziness by the staff here with a prompt table. (It was bustling, but they seated us anyone)  Many of the dishes feature fun ingredients (like chorizo and goat cheese, for omelettes) and the prices are totally reasonable. Everything I tried at the table was delicious, and the portions are completely out of control. (The potato pancakes are literally pancake sized.....oh, Cleveland)  Great spot for breakfast with a tremendously friendly crew manning the tables."}
{"text":"Not a fan. I know others will disagree. I was just there Saturday and was treated to ice cold food because I had the audacity to order pancakes, and my companion ordered an omelette. That's what a guy from the kitchen told us. It was our fault. Both menu items, nothing special. I was seated at the counter so could see right into the kitchen. Watched as all around me were served their food while we waited. The guy who sat next to me at the counter was known to the staff. He arrived way after me but finished his breakfast before we got our cold slop on the plate. I could see that the plates were just sitting there, so I don't know what the holdup was. If they can't handle pancakes, I'll go somewhere that can."}
{"text":"I had breakfast with my Mom and it was better than amazing. She had the Sweet Potato Pancakes which of course I had to have a taste. They were very light and quite tasty! She isn't a big eater but her plate was clean! I had the hash with chorizo, andouille sausage, cajun home fries which was great. I couldn't eat everything because the portion was huge. Kim was our server and she was very attentive and made sure everything was great. Great service,good prices, excellent food...what more can I say!!!"}
{"text":"Ate brunch as a group of four here early Saturday morning. Food was great. Host was great (they offer free coffee while waiting for a table out on the covered patio). Food runner was great. Almost everything was great. Service was very, very awkward. Our server never told us her name or introduced herself, but rather just walked over and asked if we needed more time to decide on our meals. She asked if everything looked okay as soon as we got our meals, but never asked us if we needed anything or if everything tasted okay, even though she continuously walked by the table, looked at our table, and kept walking. She also never asked if we were finished, but just brought our checks over without really saying anything while two of our guests were still eating. Overall just an awkward experience. Perhaps since we are younger, she was worried about us not tipping or something along those lines, although 3/4 of us are servers ourselves - not really sure. Still loved the food and the rest of the experience though."}
{"text":"This was so solid that I can pretty much guarantee I'll be back, which to me warrants a 4-star review. We went on father's day. It was really busy, and I was thrilled by the decor; really cozy but trendy, and swarming with chatty people, and mis-matched mugs and chairs. We sat in the yellow back room but I hope to sit in the front room that was lined with artwork next time. The food was good - not great - but REALLY reasonably priced and the service was pleasant (though it took them about a week to refill my coffee - a real pet peeve), and I loved the atmosphere and location. A solid brunch place and I will be back. Also: bacon chocolate pancakes. Nuff said. Also-also! The homefries are baller, and I don't even like homefries."}
{"text":"The Jambalaya Omelette is the best Omelette I have ever had and the service was really great. I will be back very soon! Got yourselves a new regular!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best breakfast in Cleveland! Just took a group of manager co workers there. they were from all over the country And they all said it was amazing. Our New York manager said it was the best corn beef hash he had ever had. The grumpys special with Blueberry pancakes was awesome. When our family goes out for breakfast this is the only place we like to go. well worth the drive if you live a little further out."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, my decision to come here was largely influenced by the restaurant name. My boyfriend and I were feeling a bit grumpy that morning, so it seemed fitting. Funny name aside, I wasn't too impressed with the food.  First of all, they only have Lipton tea for their hot tea selection which seemed like a rip off since they charged $2.50 for it. My boyfriend said their coffee wasn't great either. They use random mismatched mugs (mine was from a CPA office) which is probably supposed to give the restaurant an eclectic vibe, but it just seemed cheap.  Their menu is labeled with gluten-free labels which were helpful. I had the Eggs Florentine, but it turned out to be saucy mess. It's a hefty serving, but I got sick of the peppery flavor about halfway through the dish. My boyfriend had the Grumpy's Special which was pretty generic, but it was a good price at $6.99 whereas other restaurants charge a few dollars more for the same thing. The special comes with toast, but they don't have gluten-free bread and weren't willing to substitute extra potatoes or something else to compensate."}
{"text":"I went to Grump's yesterday for lunch. It came recommended by a friend. We had the BBQ chicken Caesar salad. It had a nice spicy flavor. Also had the Mediterranean flat bread. It was tasty but a little small for a flat bread. I used my CLEseats App and was able to get 10% off the bill. You can also get 10% off for catering with this app. The people around us were eating breakfast which looked amazing. I will have to go back for that."}
{"text":"First timer, I loved this place! Great food selection and service. I really like the local art and the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Someone at my hotel recommended Grumpy's, so 5 Stars to them first. Once I arrived the vibe is infectious, like a place you know you belong and will be taken care of. Service was spot on and the menu is just the right size. I had the Grumpy's Special with a side of French Toast. Very good, although the Cajun fries were a little to spicy for my taste for breakfast  all things considered it is a great place to eat. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Sean and I went to Grumpy's this morning for the first time with the in-laws. The restaurant is bright and clean, with art for sale on the walls. Cute place with good stand-by breakfast fare.   Nothing extremely inventive on the menu but Sean did have apple-oatmeal pancakes which are not very ordinary and he said they were very good. The bacon was thicker than most and the ham my FIL had for his side was HUGE. Also, the home fries had some cajun seasoning going on - yummy. Overall, above average if typical breakfast food. When in Tremont, it's a good bet for breakfast, but it's no Lucky's."}
{"text":"Well it was for sure a new experience! We stood inside waiting to be seated for 5 minutes before my husband decided since there was no \"please wait to be seated\" sign, that we would just sit.   It's a quaint little place, super cozy. Reminded me more of a coffee shop then a restraint. The art is for sale which I thought was cute until I saw the price tags.   The waitress was 100% grumpy. I asked her for specials and she handed me a menu. Looking at the prices, I felt I should run for the door, paying almost $10 for 2 breakfast tacos is a little much for me. She took our order and then came back to tell me there soda machine was broken. I asked her what else she had that wouldn't keep me from going to sleep because I work nights and after here I was going to bed. She told me water. Not much of a drink selection.  So our food came and much to my surprise the portions are good. I only ate one taco and half of my Cajun fries. Oh it was so yummy!!! Portions fit the price.   They aren't really kid friendly. They gave my daughter crayons and paper, but the low sitting lamps and art work made me nervous as we walked to the bathroom.  I do have to say the Christmas story lamp made it feel so cleveland!!   Recommend the food, it's amazing. The staff lives up to it's name, GRUMPY!"}
{"text":"When we arrived I immediately noticed several hungry looking people waiting outside. And I thought damn, is this place that good? I'm glad we decided to stay.....after we made our way into this eclectic joint we were seated immediately....best if you don't bring large groups maybe....The menu was a tough decision process.,..everything looked delicious. I got the Walker Hash and it was fantastic. Service was great....cool neighborhood ...,will certainly be back when I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Wow I am 60 miles away and still thinking about the food. The Soup was on point and it tasted Fresh like your Mom would never get right. But the BBQ Perogie changed the day for me. There is a lot of great food in Cleveland but I have not found better anywhere. Wow real nice Foody Place"}
{"text":"Just to touch on a review I just read, it states that the place is dirty and played all over and pricing was high. Um, negative! The place is clean, fresh, atmosphere is trendy and hip to the area. Service is decent. Clearly a place I go to, and will continue."}
{"text":"Food was just average. My biscuits and gravy tasted like a biscuit with meat flavored jello on it. The service was poor - asked for scrambled eggs, got fried eggs. Another person  in our group had her order come several minutes after everyone else's. There were inaccuracies on the check. Overall I found this place disappointing and highly overrated."}
{"text":"Pumpkin Pancakes, wonderful service, everything is delicious. The only gripe I have is its so crazy packed Sundays, but the wait is always worth it."}
{"text":"Great place for hearty breakfast and brunch choices - I had the eggs on corn beef hash, and was really full and content with my choice! I tried my sister's breakfast burrito with sausage in it, and it was really good!"}
{"text":"Delicious brunch spot! Ten minute wait on a Sunday a.m. (unheard of!) and the food was out of this world! The Grumpy's special was only $7 and you get so much food! Cajun potatoes were spicy and flavorful and the breakfast tacos are fresh and tasty. Great experience!!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful breakfast here! I had Eggs Benedict and French Toast pressed in walnuts. Both were excellent! My daughter had chocolate chip pancakes and they were delicious! They have the best hot chocolate!! : ) excellent service!"}
{"text":"Its not bad for what it is. I had the 8oz steak, Cajun potatoes, eggs sunny side up and a fruit bowl. I requested the steak to be medium/rare and it was very close. It wasnt perfect but the steak was very delicious and the meal total was $14.00 so I couldnt complain. The thing I think I liked the best about the experiance was that they offered a heated seating area and coffee while we waited. It was crowded but the food came quickly and was worth the wait. Cheers!"}
{"text":"We are from California, but it was so nice to visit Grumpy's when were in town. The service was so great, everyone was so nice and welcoming. There was a little wait due to it being a Saturday morning, but the food is worth it. I actually had the walnut french toast with fruit and my husband had the pumpkin pancakes. Our cousin ordered an omelet. All of the food was great. Simple, yet satisfying. Thanks to the staff for being awesome."}
{"text":"Grumpy's really deserves 4.5 stars. Great breakfast and lunch items in a cute, art filled (and a little cramped) space. Try their Ruben."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a pretty normal breakfast in Treemont- this is a good place to go. Their food is pretty good- normal breakfast fare and the restaurant is fun and colorful. Eggs, pancakes, etc- nothing crazy delicious but good.   They do indeed have a leg lamp in the front window :)"}
{"text":"Loved this place so much! Was easy to do family style and the French toast was amazing! The wait was lengthy but they do serve coffee while you wait. Service was great and the food was fresh and fast."}
{"text":"Found this gem by accident, but glad I did. Good is very good especially the breakfast. Definitely worth a visit when in Tremont."}
{"text":"Okay, here we go.   First time I went to Grumpy's I got the Grumpy's Special --- SO GOOD! I really enjoyed it. It's a simple, classic breakfast choice but it was executed well, hot, and delicious. My coffee mug was never empty and my water was promptly refilled. Great experience overall. Minus the French Toast which was an add-on. It tasted like nothing. But the rest was so good it prompted my boyfriend and I to return the following week!   The return visit was not nearly as satisfying ... for either of us. We got there a little later than the previous weekend so there was a wait. No big deal - we were able to sneak into two bar seats within 10-15 mins. Service was quick and efficient - my favorite!  It was packed and we waited about 30 minutes for our breakfast. I thought it was a little excessive. But again - it was busy. I ordered the breakfast burrito because it looked amazing someone else's plate. Mine was close to inedible. It was soggy eggs in a soggy wrap with canned salsa. I possible had 2 bites tops. However, I did enjoy my cajun home fries. They were delicious. My boyfriend got the corned beef hash and said it was okay.   My conclusion: I will go back. I will only get the Grumpy's Special. I don't see myself trying anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast place. I was there with a friend for brunch and enjoyed the vibe of this restaurant. They have an awesome logo of a grumpy man hanging over what looks like it used to be a dive bar. When you get inside though, it's artsy and bright with lots of windows. It's almost like they want to scare away the uncool people, so it's only the cool ones that don't take themselves too seriously that will venture in.  The drinks were served in large glass mugs like you'd see in a steak house, which I love. It makes me feel like a kid again when they serve drinks in glasses that are so big that even I won't finish the whole thing. And I love me some water!  I had the vegetarian eggs benedict which was really pretty good. Not many places offer the benedit veggie-style, and it seems like this place has had quite a bit of practice doing. It was more food than I could finish, which isn't usually the case in breakfast joints. The cajun home fries really tied it all in with the creamy holandaise sauce and all the vegetables on the plate made me feel like I was getting something a little more well-balanced than pancakes. My friend had the pancakes and she seemed very happy with her selection. I would definitely go back.  Breakfast food is difficult to get too creative with, and to make an impression on people. Grumpy's is a step above -- not two steps -- but definitely a step above."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. BUSY BUSY BUSY! The parking lot and restaurant were completely packed and we were lucky to even get a spot. It was worth it. We had a large group of 7 or so. The food came out in a timely manner, but the waitress forgot a few things (coffee, side dishes). All of the breakfast food is fantastic. Pancakes, skillets, breakfast tacos etc were all delicious. I actually can't stop looking at the pictures and wanting to go back haha.   Visit here for sure if you want a hearty breakfast on the weekend, just get here early so you don't have to wait long."}
{"text":"Grumpy's was a-okay.  Sunday around 11 AM. About an hour wait; but we had a party of 9. Decor was okay I guess, not meticulous about that myself. Our table was not wobbly though.  Ordered the grumpy's special, w/ a choice of meat (sausage for me), egg (sunny side up), home fries, and pumpkin pancakes, all for $7.99.  Nothing special. Just any other continental breakfast you can have from any other places. Pumpkin pancakes don't taste all that special or delicious."}
{"text":"I went to grumpy's cafe for a breakfast meeting.  I love the atmosphere and the food was delicious ( especially the pancakes)!"}
{"text":"The main reason I went was super attracted to the restaurant name. The food quality is not on the top, but not the bottom either. Service was great. The waitress paid very close attention to their customer. Although the place is alway growed with people, you may ask to sit outside if you prefer a more quite environment. I ordered Grumpy's special, the waitress brought three bottles of sauce for my election, and one of them is maple syrups, still warm. That is a five stars service! The only complain is that the outside of the bottle wasnr clean, so I got this sticky feeling after touching it.   Overall, this is a trip worth to try. $2.50 bus ride from Cleveland to the restaurant, and then 15 mins walk to Christmas Story Store. Why not?"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.   Stopped in here after church for a quick brunch with a friend who also loves to eat. We had originally planned to stop into Bac...and was sad that it's closed on Sundays (whatttt?!), so we chose the place next door to it- Grumpy's.   You walk in and it's super bright. Super bright walls, and people are happy. People aren't that Grumpy. :P jk. They have a lot of cool art along the walls too...it was cute.  We were seated right away and ordered right away. We split a jambalaya omelet and a chocolate french toast. The jambalaya omelet had this weird Kraft cheese single slice melted on it (really? a Kraft single?) and wasn't too spicy. I think if it had better cheese on it and had some kick in it, it would have been good.   My friend knew that I wanted something sweet (I can't help it. I'll probably turn diabetic in a few years), so we ordered their homemade chocolate french toast. Yum yum. They melted some semisweet milk chocolate on the french toast and put some whipped cream on it...on top of a homemade french toast. I mean, it wasn't spectacular...but I like sweet? hahha.  The service was good. They were constantly clearing our tables, filling our coffees and waters, and got us our food and items we asked for, right away. Grumpy's a good place for breakfast-stop by there if you're in Tremont, for sure."}
{"text":"Most of what I read online said that Grumpy's claims a southwest influence. Although we had a good meal, I have to thoroughly dispute this. Nothing about the meal we had was indicative of a truly southwestern meal. I don't think a little bit of spices on the home fries and the way too big helping of salsa in the breakfast burrito qualifies as \"southwest.\" If Grumpy's incorporated avocado, black beans, spanish rice, tamales, etc., then I might reconsider my opinion.  I did enjoy my breakfast burrito - the portion was satisfying and the ingredients were fresh and hot. My home fries were half dry and half undercooked, and definitely could have been better.   Overall, service was decent and the menu is a little better than average."}
{"text":"I have been there twice so I think I can be fair with this place - I really loved their corn beef hash. Their Egg Benedict seems pretty awesome too!  This place is not that busy and crazy like other places so you definitely can get a seat pretty soon. Their inside is very cutely decorated with paintings and decors on the wall. I'm sure you can also buy them cuz I saw the price label on them.  Overall, a fair, cute place for a lovely saturday brunch. It's not that pricey either, definitely a good place for some casual time."}
{"text":"I had the walker hash and husband had the Grumpy's special.   The portions were huge, the coffee was great and the server (Kayla) was attentive.    Two definite thumbs up from these out-of-towners!"}
{"text":"Grumpy's is a quaint spot just outside the main Tremont restaurant hustle and bustle. My friend and I had never been before and were excited to try it after its name kept cropping up. The menu was filled with egg dishes (which I avoid) but happily, I found a diverse veggie dish that was an excellent value for the price - bean salad, grilled veggies, fruit, and Cajun home fries for under $10! I wasn't wowed by the atmosphere or menu choices but I would come back knowing they have a few non-egg options and fresh flavors."}
{"text":"The cafe itself is really charming-- lots of local art on the walls.  The service was friendly.  The food-- pretty good.  My jambalaya was a disappointment-- just some rice with a rather plain tomato sauce and a few chunks of sausage, chicken and shrimp thrown almost as an afterthought.  Nothing stewed together to meld the flavors.  It required much, much hot sauce.  My companions chirozo burritos were really good, with the right amount of spice.  the accompanying potatoes were bland without copious amounts of hot sauce.  The kids' menu items were tasty.  Maybe I'll try brunch."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Grumpy's twice now, once for lunch, and once for dinner.  Both times I was satisfied with the food and the experience.  Generally, the cuisine seems to come from a Tex-Mex point of view.  Quesadillas, tortilla chips, chorizo, etc., and I am ok with with.  On both visits, the service was a little slow, but overall they were friendly and reasonably attentive.  The Texas Caviar, is an interesting take on salsa, using whole beans instead of tomatoes as the base.  The Rhino Burger was also good, mixing Chorizo with beef for the patty and served on grilled texas toast.   The meatloaf was good, but maybe would have been better with a little more seasoning.  It wasn't bad, it just seemed to be missing \"something\".  The price/portion ratio seems to be pretty good.   The portion/price ratio seems to be pretty fair, which is always a good thing.  I suppose one of these days I'll have to come back for the brunch, but either way I'd be happy to go back for lunch or dinner again too."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in Cleveland.coffee is great service. I recommend getting there early on weekends for brunch since it gets pretty busy the even if there is a wait it moves pretty fast. Cajun home fries are amazing...i love the new menu ...they took of the southwest omelette off the menu but they make it for me whenever I'm there...pumpkin pancakes are great! This is a definite must try!"}
{"text":"Checked out this place due to all the rage per the internet. Ordered the benidect, it was meh... the ham on it was good. The cajun homefries are okay. I also had to try the most talked about item in the reviews, the sweet potato pancakes. TOTAL disappointment BRO CHOCH-O. I didn't even finish them, they were not the joy I was expecting. Would I eat here again... Maybe.   P.S. Waitress emotionless robot. Not a cool robot, but a creepy girl robot."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite casual brunch in the Cleveland area. The apple oatmeal pancakes with cinnamon butter are so fluffy and tasty you won't even want to put syrup on top. The biscuits and gravy will stick to your ribs all day. Almost everything comes with spicy fried potato hash on the side. The servers are attentive and will offer to top off your coffee before you ever get to the bottom of the cup."}
{"text":"I came to Grumpy's a lot when I lived in Tremont. It seems like a lot of people come in here hungover. The food is decent and cheap enough. I just like breakfast food and this place does a decent job at it. Lucky's is lucky they can charge people so much for the food because Guy Fieri showed up. The TV is a crazy thing."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I really like the atmosphere. The service was good, food fast, and bathrooms clean (just lacking paper towel). We had biscuits and gravy, pumpkin pancakes, and a beef tips, mushroom, and cheese omelette. My only disappointments were the lack of fresh squeezed orange juice and the American cheese instead of cheddar on the omelette. Otherwise breakfast was great and I loved the Cajun homefries!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of hit or miss. I've been here twice, once it was great and once it was below average l."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing and cozy i love this place and ill be back and i will bring others as well for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped at Grumpy's while going to the history museum with my family, and we all couldn't have been more pleased. The staff was nice, the establishment was clean, food was nice, price was great. The shops in and around Tremont are always fun to go to, and Grumpy's is now one that I will visit again."}
{"text":"Little to no wait. Hostess was sweet. Hall area was hard to maneuver; waitstaff was indifferent. Our waitress Lauren seemed a bit grumpy (how fitting!). Food was decent for the price. I had the pumpkin pancakes. Good but not great. Still... it was such a bargain. Also, the restaurant was LOUD! Poor acoustics and the radio in the background didn't help. I would go again as it was a deal and my G'ma loved it."}
{"text":"You will not regret coming here! Every single thing on the menu is amazing. I've been here about three times and try to get something different each time. Have brought many people here and nobody was ever disappointed"}
{"text":"The breakfast special is the best. There is lot of food given for just $4.99 and there are cheap add ons ($2-3 for pancakes) if you want more. I got the special one recent morning with Chorizo from a local butcher shop. It was so good and matched in flavor by the Cajun home fries. I added on some blueberry pancakes and was well pleased. The pancakes' bottom was completely blue - so many blueberries packed into the pancake! They were also of a normal size which makes them a bit more appetizing compared to the size other places serve up.  I love the vibe of this place. It feels like home. It's super busy, but you never feel rushed. The mix matched coffee mugs contribute to this as does all the local, and some kids, art hanging on the walls. They open at 7am making it the perfect before work stop. You can't beat a cheap place that has an inviting atmosphere, consistently good food even when crazy busy, and pleasant servers. I love all the creative unique dishes other restaurants turn out for brunch but sometimes nothing will suffice but some homemade home-style cooking."}
{"text":"Grump's is anything but grumpy! You're greeted by the bright decorations, Cleveland-themed art & playlist of upbeat pop tunes.   When we came in right as they opened there were also 3 other tables already seated by 8:05. Our server greeted us, took our order for coffee & water and brought it promptly. In retrospect, we probably shouldn't have ordered coffee because service was so prompt we were in and out before we could even finish a cup. (Sidenote, apparently the coffee is a house blend but tasted like folgers to me. Not really worth the money imo).   After we ordered, we waited approximately 6 minutes for our food: West 14th - homemade corner beef hash, 2 eggs, & choice of housemade toast Breakfast burrito - eggs, cheese & choice of meat in a flour tortilla with Cajun potatoes.   The west 14th was OUTSTANDING. Much more than I had anticipated. Typically when I have house made hash it's stringy and dry. Not at grumpys. It was the perfect amount of corned beef to potatoes to onion to seasoning. Amazing flavor. Paired with the incredibly delicious homemade rye bread the whole dish was the best hash I've ever had.   The burrrito was as you'd expect. Appropriately filling and tasty. The salsa it came with was a hit.  I will warn you about the Cajun potatoes-- if you're not a fan of spicy, steer clear. These have a big kick! They also were a little soft for our liking.   Overall-- great service, delicious food, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Fun little spot in Cleveland, had a nice veggy Benedict with avocado and tomato. Reasonable prices and good strong coffee. Uber ride from downtown was about $9 each way"}
{"text":"A very good brunch spot! Street parking is free and always available. I got the starkweather omelet which was really good. I dont usually eat a lot but I actually finished the entire plate."}
{"text":"Great place! Tables are a little close. May make it compacted, but food and service was just great. Very busy place though. I ordered \"Veggie Benedict\" and my wife ordered \"Fajita Omelet\" both were very delicious. Served with home made Cajun fries.  I literally wiped my plate with a piece of toast at the end. Perfectly cooked and served. Potato pancakes were also delicious. LOVED THE FOOD."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Grumpy's!  My husband and I have been to Grumpy's several times for breakfast and just now had the chance to try lunch. I had the blackened Salmon Caesar salad and it was out of this world.  My husband tried one of the boxty sandwiches and loved it.  We always have great service there and the girls are very friendly.  It is nice to see the owner walking around checking on things.  We always feel welcome at Grumpy's and that is why we come back. Never had a bad meal there!"}
{"text":"I love the logo of this place. So much so I bought a T-shirt. We grumps are so misunderstood.  I will wear this shirt with my own kind of grumpy pride.   I'm going to sound like Joe McTourist and say \"I never would have found this place if it wasn't for Yelp!\". Totally true. I love breakfast food. And since I am unfamiliar with the area, the Yelp App certainly came through!  Grumpy's is a super cute place. Looks like it used to be a house. And I love the Leg Lamp in the window (see my review for the Christmas Story House). The lighting and colors make this place so inviting, and the decor eclectic and fun.   Our group of 3 and a half visited mid week about 9am. No wait. The menu has a nice array of the usual suspects--pancakes, eggs and omelets. But there's a nice choice of different kinds of the usual suspects. Chocolate French Toast? I know I can't get that around my hometown. Same for a Jambalaya Omelet.   I opted for the Veggie Benedict and got to try some of my son's buttermilk pancakes.  Both were really good. The eggs for the benedict were perfectly poached and I loved the bit of spice with the cajun home fries. The pancakes were good too, just a touch crispy on the edges (love!) but soft and fluffy throughout.   Service was nice. Definitely laid back. I loved that they asked my 2 year old how he was doing too and made him laugh. So very sweet."}
{"text":"Great service with a smile. Prices were good and the Cajun home fries are actually hot. Sometimes others version of hot is a lot different then mine, in this case they weren't lying. Great location. We were in from Boston with no car and were happy to find this gem within walking distance from where we stayed. Friendly staff and food came out fast. We even came back for brunch on another day."}
{"text":"Grumpy's should be called friendly's - well maybe not like the ice cream restaurant. But this is s very friendly restaurant with fresh tasty food and a nice staff. I have stopped in here a few times for breakfasts and lunch and have always had a great experience!"}
{"text":"This is a bit of a hipster place so a breakfast is found to set you back a little more then most. The food is pretty good and the place was packed. The service was great. Interesting art on the walls that's available for sale, so you can get a cool souvenir if something really catches your eye."}
{"text":"My auntie recommended this breakfast joint to me. Eggs and toast were very good... Staff was nice. I recommend the carminator  if you like veggies and eggs in a wrap. Would return for eggs but certainly not for Pancakes. OJ had pulp which I love."}
{"text":"Got the Jumbalaya omelette with Cajun fries and wheat toast. Definitely comfort food and extremely delicious. Great choice in Tremont."}
{"text":"I love blueberry pancakes, and theirs are delicious. I was happy with the service and cost."}
{"text":"Great food always. Breakfast has wonderful omelets.  Lunch is fast and delicious.  Service is always prompt and friendly.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Grumpy's is in my top 3 favorite breakfast spots in the greater Cleveland area. I have been here probably 20 or so times and have tried a good portion of the menu. To start I love the Cajun breakfast potatoes. The first meal I ever had was the eggs benedict and it instantly hooked me. I also love the corned beef hash. They make omlettes that are huge and very fresh. Depending on the time of day you go the wait time can get pretty long. They do have a little patio area where the have a self serve coffee stand while you wait. This place is truly great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Grumpy's in Tremont is packed on the weekends, but if you're a party of two you won't wait more than 15 minutes. Make sure you go all out and get the Grumpy's Special with French toast. You won't regret it. For you coffee lovers, they brew Caruso coffee, which is a local toaster in Cleveland--it'll help you cure that hangover in no time!"}
{"text":"Salmon salad was yummy.  Fresh food."}
{"text":"I have been to Grumpy's for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Each time I have gotten quick and friendly service.  Grumpy's also serves fresh and delicious home cooked meals.  Some of my favorites are the pancakes , spinach power bowl and the salmon quinoa bowl.  My hubby likes the reuben sandwich. We have never been disappointed in either the food or service.  I also love that they have a private parking lot - helpful while dining in Tremont. Here is another tip - get the CLEseats app and save 10 or 15% off every time you dine :)"}
{"text":"Go here! It's an amazing breakfast place with great food and coffee. The service is awesome and quick. There is parking and plenty of seats. Wished we lived closer!"}
{"text":"Love brunch here. Omelette with Texas caviar is very good. Great Tremont atmosphere. Artwork on the walls is for sale and is always so cute!"}
{"text":"perfect. every single time. I'll come to tremont just to eat at Grumpy's. The salmon quinoa salad is amazing. the service is quick and efficient. great job!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times (5 or 6?) and literally just LOVE it. Now, let me start off by saying I've only been here for breakfast/brunch so I have NO comment on lunch. But, I just love coming here for breakfast/brunch to catch up with friends or some MUCH needed eggs and potatoes after a long night of drinking!   I pretty much always get the Egg Skillet - it's my fave thing there... potatoes, veggies, scrambled eggs, and cheese - and a whole lot of it! Comes with a side of toast. The breakfast burrito is really good, too. And OH MY GOD - Pumpkin pancakes!!! absolutely delish!! Everything is decently priced, too.   The service is consistently good every time I go. Everyone is super nice. The register gets kind of crowded and confusion, which sucks. There's usually a line to put your name in (depending on what day you go) and somewhere merging into the same line are people trying to pay and leave - all in the middle of the main room.   Overall, I'm in love with Grumpy's- it's easily my favorite brunch spot in cle... I definitely need to check it out for lunch sometime soon."}
{"text":"Prices are fair. Food ok. Service mediocre (hit or miss). Noticed a few tables that were getting more attention than us. Ironically the server were friends with the table. What a cowinkydink"}
{"text":"So Grumpy's was super busy and it was around 8 or 9ish in the morning...people wanted their breakfast lol. I decided to get mines to go, so I ordered the Breakfast Burrito with Bacon and Cajun Home Fries. To me, I thought the restaurant was a little cramped...maybe a little more space is need in the front area.  Staff acknowledged customers and had good attitudes. I sat at the counter area while I waited for my order and had a good view of the kitchen. The guys (and girl) were kind of killing it on the flat top, lol they were not playing. I was watching the one guy making a lot of omelets, kind of regretted my decision on the breakfast burrito (next visit...maybe).  When I got the burrito, for some reason I thought the home fries were going to be inside the burrito...nope, it was on the side. It would have kind of been better if home fries were inside the burrito.  Didn't get a set up with my to go order...like napkins...ketchup, hot sauce, heck even a fork since the home fries were on the side.  There are other menu items I would like to try out and definitely need to sit down and eat at the Grumpy's.  Would like to give this another chance."}
{"text":"The service and food here is always awesome!!  I really enjoy stopping for brunch, and my husband prefers their dinner/lunch menu. The service are all very nice and take great care of you.  Make it a stop if you are in the area!"}
