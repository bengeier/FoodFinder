{"text":"Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful This a small gem of a restaurant! Everything excellent! You need to plan ahead for a reservation but it was well worth it and we are looking forward to a return visit! Excelent food and superb friendly service So happy this place is in my neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was warm and welcoming (delicious smells wafting from the kitchen helped). A good mix of romantic but comfortable. The food was fantastic. I won't pretend to be some kind of expert chef or critic, I'm not, but I know Greta Soloman's is serving excellent food and wine. The owner was lovely and hospitable."}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends this week at greta solomans - the escargot and carrots were the highlight of my week! And their negronis are perfection. Ambiance is nice; prices are high but well worth it. Service was amazing as Well! Anther new fave in the neighbourhood that I've only recently come to visit."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! Felt like I was in Europe -- pleasing grownup atmosphere, nice lighting, pleasant background music, I could hear my friends, attentive but not in-your-face service, no Leafs pennants or giant TV screen ... PLUS interesting and well-made cocktails, short but excellent wine list, and very good food -- terrific steak, and a crème brûlée that's far and away better than that served in places that claim to have \"Toronto's best\".  In short, definitely worth return visits."}
{"text":"Have you ever been to a place where every detail has been taken care of and yet doesn't feel stiff? That is Greta Solomon's.  When you enter, you'll see your name handwritten on a reservation card at your table.  The lighting is subdued yet you can see everything. The music is unfamiliar yet soothing, not necessarily French as you might expect.  And the food arrives at just the right time and arranged just perfectly so.  You might have been forewarned about the portions when you researched the place and the restaurant is not at all apologetic about their small plates.  Yet you will feel very satisfied with every bite.  And your mind might wander back to that expensive French restaurant in Montreal associated with a famous chef where you got served  an atrociously priced hamburger.  At that moment, you think to yourself, Greta Solomon's is better, so much better."}
{"text":"Stopped by one night for the prix fixe menu. The food was delicious! Each course was delicate and flavourful. Service was great. The restaurant is quite small so it does feel a bit cramped. I would probably stop by again in the future."}
{"text":"The dishes are well executed, but I really don't see this as a place really worth visiting.  Service was friendlyISH.  The owner/bartender was visibly unhappy with us as soon as we declined drinks, and when asked if she had anything non-alcoholic, was quick was a simple, curt \"No.\" and just walked away.  Our second server which much nicer, and was happy to help us pick the grilled whole branzino and the quail. I was OK with my fish, which was pretty well prepared and finished with brown butter.  My husband's quail, however, was ostentatiously priced at $18 for what was basically half a quail (if you aren't familiar with quail, picture your fist, then cut that size in half, and that's what you're left with). It's fine if it were offered as an appetizer, but to try and pass it off as a main dish left an empty belly and an over all negative impression.  Sad, because the place looked charming, but we'd basically never come back again."}
{"text":"Dinner at Greta Solomon's exceeded my expectations. I have passed the restaurant many times on Queen Street and had saved it as a place to go with diners who appreciate good food as well as atmosphere.    It's important to make a reservation though there are several seats at the bar.  When you enter, you're transported to another time and space. There is a tiny blackboard with your name reserving your table. When you sit down, the server offers to bring you water and provides you ample time to study the drinks menu.  I had beet salad as a starter and then the beef filet.  Just exquisite execution from the chef.  One of my guests has a dairy allergy and the chef was able to make an accommodation for her version of the beef filet.  It is recommended that you order two to three items for your main meal (the concept is small plates).  I would say that the portions are just perfect. Shared the poached pear with my friend. We were all satiated by the end of the meal. Nothing left behind except contentment over a wonderful meal.  Will definitely return. One more thing. While the restaurant is intimate, you can navigate a conversation without shouting. This is the place to go for a great meal but also good conversation that you can hear."}
{"text":"Meh. It was overpriced for extremely small portions. We paid $45 for a prix fix which was more than the a la cart menu. We left hungry and grumpy. Won't be going again."}
{"text":"We went there on a Saturday night and enjoyed it quite a bit  The room is small and quite charming. I do wonder what it would be like more crowded; the tables are pretty close together  Service was pleasant. Server was very nice. She sort of got slammed with three or four tables all at once so was a little slow getting organized, but not annoyingly slow  The food is the high point. My partner prefers steak tartare a nit more minced, not the larger chunks but flavored were nice. The tomato tartare was really nice, fresh and tasty. The mains, I had the steak, we're both delicious. It's a French place, so I had the creme brûlée and it was perfect with a lovely crust and the creamiest inside. My partner had the tart, worth the price alone  Whether a casual couples date dinner or a gathering of friends, this place is worth the trip"}
{"text":"If you're visiting Toronto, you really should hop over to Leslieville in its East end. Greta Solomon's has been open for about 5 months. Over time, several friends have told me we would love it, and we did! For us, those really memorable dining experiences start with attention to detail, and with the personality of the owners themselves. The owner of Greta Solomon's (a combination of her grandmother's name and her grandfather's name) is a lovely, unpretentious woman from Newfoundland, who is clearly passionate about food and excellence, who is very hands on, and who seems like a genuinely lovely person. The restaurant seats about 28, so I would highly recommend a reservation. From the moment we entered, we knew it was going to be a very good night. On all the tables were little chalkboard easels with the name of the reserved party. NICE touch. In the restrooms there are disposable toothbrushes and other dental care items, in case you are on that special date. LOVED that. We happened to hit Greta's on a Wednesday, when bubbly and oysters were half price. Total bonus. There were four in our party. The cocktail list was beautiful, and so were the drinks it presented. The wine list is super solid, with many wines available by the glass. I am a bread person, and I have to say, the bread was so amazing it's a wonder I didn't sneak into the kitchen and grab more. For appetizers our party had the kale-based salads...very good....and I had 6 oysters, which were superb. For our mains, one of our party had the duck, and said it was perfection. Two of our party had the catch of the day, which today was a lobster dish, and they loved it. I had the filet de boeuf and it was perfect. The chef comes from a restaurant I used to love (it closed recently) called Pangaea. He has done an amazing job creating this menu. For dessert I had the cheese plate and a glass of poire William. The cheeses were thoughtfully selected and presented. Others in my party raved about the coffee-sauced beignettes and the creme brulee. We all four left feeling well-fed, but not bloated, and that, too, is the mark of a great restaurant. We will be back, and in the meantime, you have to try it :)"}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  Went here for dinner on a weeknight and made a reservation stating that I was gluten-free. This is a small space that seated about 20 or so people. There was one waitress and who I believe to be the owner. The service was excellent - polite and very attentive. They understood that I was gluten-free and made sure my food was prepared accordingly.   The menu only has a few items on it, but it did have a few gluten-free options. I went with the special of the day, which was a pan seared trout on top of vegetables. It was delicious, especially paired with the wine I had. I also had the creme brulee, which was really good as well.   The vibe of this place is very intimate so this is a perfect spot to catch up with a good friend or spent some time with your special someone.   TL;DR Delicious food, attentive staff, intimate vibe"}
{"text":"Great place!  We had the 5 course tasting menu on a Tuesday night. The food was presented well, and tasted even better. The highlights were the red cabbage soup and lamb with pumpkin. I would have given this place 5 stars, but it list a star for not explaining any of the 10 dishes when served..."}
{"text":"Honestly the nicest dinner and the most lovely restaurant. It felt like France. I had the chicken liver mousse, which was divine, and the filet of beef that could not have been more perfectly cooked. My guest had the food gras, which was lovely and buttery and both apps were served with a wonderful compote. He also had the cassoulet, which was wonderful. I will totally be back as soon as I can!"}
{"text":"as you can see from the previous posts, the quality of the food is great, very well presented and high quality. the service is wonderful and the restaurant is small but really nice. good wine list too.  my biggest complaint is the size of the portions. i understand that some restaurants serve small portions, but this was a little excessive (or minuscule). considering the cost of a nice dinner, i would expect larger portions. i felt like the majority of my filling was from the beignet."}
{"text":"In my opinion total perfection is hard to achieve. It would mean that the service, food, ambiance and wine list were flawless. Well, let's start with the wine. A well curated selection of French classics with a couple of well-timed new world wines for good measure. We are off to a good start. The food was impeccable, with great portions and really stayed true to its French roots. I also liked the small, yet well thought out menu. 2 for 2. The service was good. Our often silly food questions were answered and the meal was brought out in a timely fashion. One more to go. Finally, we get to the ambiance. My wife and I were seated next to the door, which at first was a little off-putting, but because of the layout and size of the restaurant, it wasn't a big deal. The decor was very nice and complimented the food and service well. Note. In the winter, that table near the door will be brutal. But let's ignore that and get back to the quality of this restaurant. This restaurant is what Lesliville is all about. Quiet, well-appointed, quality."}
{"text":"We had a group of four dining. Service by Emma.  Absolutely amazing dining. The food was very fresh. The foie gras was phenomenal. My wife loved the octopus and I tremendously enjoyed the cassoulet.  Finally the souffle was one of the best I've ever had. Emma was outstanding and really guided us through the dishes."}
{"text":"What a gem!  I headed to Greta Solomon's on a weeknight to catch up with a friend over dinner.   Firstly, the atmosphere is to die for. What a beautiful little spot! (Note: really little, like 10-12 tables max). It seems like the owner took a ton of time selecting the decor and little details that give this place a ton of personality.   Secondly, menu. It's small but mighty. We tried a number of dishes, including the fresh bread, smoked salmon salad, sardine toast and the filet main. All dishes are small, so big appetites beware, but they're so delicately plated and balanced, they're heavenly. I totally recommend ordering a bunch of options and sharing!   Thirdly, oyster night! Wednesday has half priced oysters and half priced sparkling - the perfect combo!   The one thing I would say is that I wish the location were more central, but honestly if that's the only thing I'm complaining about this place is a win for sure.   Can't wait to come back soon!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  The place is small, which I like, and noise level isn't loud like most places. We went on a Tuesday night which meant \"tasting menu\" only. We started with the 3 course, and quick realized that we would need to change to the 5 course, based on serving sizes. - The fish dish was surprisingly good! I think it'll be worth checking out a different night with their regular menu."}
