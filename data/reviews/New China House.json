{"text":"Visiting my wife in Monroeville and decided to give this place a try. Ordered chow mein, among other things. The food shows up 30 minutes LATE (was quoted 45 minutes, took 1:15 to show up), and the chow mein was apparently a different 'style' of chow mein, it came as just a bunch of vegetables, no noodles. I explained to the woman on the phone when I ordered it I would like noodles, cabbage, ect (like every other Chinese restaurant on earth serves it). The delivery man tells me I wanted Cantonese Chinese food, unfortunately New China does not serve Cantonese food. I wish the lady who took my order would have told me that."}
{"text":"I called and place an order for delivery. I called back like 30seconds later to tell them I wanted a spring roll that came with my combination platter instead of an egg roll because I forgot to mention it before. This is when the lady on the phone yells something in her language to the other workers and comes back to the phone and says \"Actually, we can't deliver to you.\" And when I asked why she answered, \" Because we are really busy.\" I just said ok and hung up the phone. Not only did you lose a $30 order, but you definitely lost a customer too."}
{"text":"New China House is the only place I will get Chinese Take-Out from.  I travel about twenty minutes to get there from where I live even though there are several places closer, it's well worth it.  It's your typical Chinese Take-Out place but you can eat inside.  They have two or three tables that seat four people each.  The price is definitely average but the portions go beyond my own expectations and the taste is amazing.  The staff is very friendly and they are prompt with getting their orders done.  They also offer delivery but since I live quite a ways from them I am not sure how they are on that.    I recommend the General Tso's, it's spicy and hot like it should be and not at all like the sweet stuff you will find at some places.  I've also tried the Sweet and Sour Chicken with their sauce which is excellent.  The Egg Drop Soup which is also better than you'd expect.  I can't express enough how large the portions are in regards to the low price.  I've ordered enough food to feed a small army (ok, four people) and the tab only came to $30 or so.  If you're in the area and you're sick of the typical Take-Out joints and haven't tried this place you definitely should.  I've recommended it to everyone I know and not a single person has been disappointed."}
{"text":"This has been our go to Chinese food restaurant for over a year. They are authentic, consistent and efficient! Whether we have food delivered or opt for takeout, we are always very pleased with the food. It's always hot, fresh and very tasty! I've already stopped ordering from the other local Chinese restaurants. The other plus is that they will customize order too.  My favorite dishes are the House Special Lo Mein, Shrimp Egg Foo Young, Beef and Brocolli, Sweet and Sour Shrimp and Crab Ragoon. I can eat their food everyday! Please don't pass on them, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fast delivery, great food. We each ordered something different. Pepper steak, general Tsos (with white meat), shrimp with mixed vegetables and Kung pao shrimp, and egg rolls. Everything was fresh and they were very nice. Make sure you ask for sauces with your egg rolls."}
{"text":"Convenient, courteous, quick, and yummy are the words I have for this place. The food is quite authentic, as authentic as the local area's ability to supply authentic ingredients can be. Its not big city Chinatown  authenticity but as good as can practically be I think. I also must  comment them on being able to maintain a large and varied menu to be able to keep up with my dietary whims. Try their Singapore fried noodles. It out matches yhe same dish made by many restaurants in Hong Kong."}
{"text":"I order delivery from here while visiting Monroeville every few months. Pretty standard Chinese food and not disappointing, especially for the price. For some reason I just HAVE to order their steamed dumplings every time! Very good."}
{"text":"I was looking for some Chinese for lunch and pulled in but when I saw the condition I turned around around but the reviews were great so I pulled back in.  In short, I wasn't impressed.  The place was kind of dirty and dreary and not very appealing.  The general tso's was basically like a hot buffalo wing sauce and just not right at all.  Maybe the other food is better?  Honestly, I'll probably never go back to find out."}
{"text":"As far as \"fast food\" Chinese goes, this is fairly standard place.  It happens to be our go to for quick Chinese food. They have a pretty standard menu with reasonable prices.  I like that they have both small and large options for all their entrees and soups.  Nothing is exceptional or incredibly memorable, but the standard fare is tasty and fresh.  One of my go to's is the kung pao chicken and the veggies are fresh and crisp and the peanuts are plentiful.  They are ok with substitutions and customization.  (I always ask for extra water chestnuts). The best deals are there lunch specials.  Nice portions and a combo platter gives you additional food m. Delivery is always within the stated time (and usually takes less time) If you are in monroeville and are looking for Chinese, check them out."}
{"text":"Had a craving for some Chinese this evening so I took to yelp to find out what's good and available for delivery (lazy and proud).  I ordered the vegetable lo mein, sweet & sour chicken, and spring rolls (there's a minimum delivery price of $15, so I had to order more than I would have.. guess it's left over Chinese for the next day or two!).  The time quoted was an hour, and they were here in a little less than that.  The portions are huge, and the prices are really reasonable, which is awesome! Everything was great, plus their delivery area is only in monroeville, but they were willing to deliver my food to me in Plum, which was really appreciated!"}
{"text":"I'm rating this based on Monroeville standards. My husband and I have been residing in Monroeville for about 8 months now and this place has the best Chinese take out around. I refuse to get Chinese take out unless it's from New China House. This place is a little hard to find if you are trying to locate it at night, but it is in that dimly lit strip mall next to a gas station."}
{"text":"Well.....gotta say....food is flavorful and lots of yummy vegetables in each order.  The thing that perplexed me is the chicken doesn't taste like chicken and the beef doesn't taste like beef.  I couldn't tell the difference between my beef entree and chicken entree.  A bit concerning....."}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice in the past week now, both times for takeout. I probably will never eat in at this place. It had 6 tables in all in here, and no decor what so ever. But I am okay with that, I like my Chinese food to go and eaten infront of my tv. Now I will start this review stating, yes I am very picky about Chinese food. For an Americanized Chinese restaurant, this was good. I ordered bok choy and Kung pao chicken, both had too much water chestnut for my taste but the flavoring on the Kung pao chicken was good (just enough spicy, the way I like it). The second time I ordered a broccoli and chicken, but I asked them to prepare it special so it's healthier, white sauce with a little soy and to make it a little spicy. I saw them pack the food and they def packed as much as they could in those little white round togo bowls. For 6 bucks, that's a great deal!  Word of caution, those Togo bowls are HOT! They are so thin that taking them out of the bag was tricky."}
{"text":"Ordered from here on a whim. Got a decent amount of food for what I spent. The not-greats: The rice was somehow very sticky but also very dry. The dumplings were mushy mouthfuls of moisture, but didnt taste too bad. General Tso's was OK. The pork and bean sprouts dish was ok. Eggrolls were good. (Drumroll,please). The chicken wings were OUTSTANDING! Perfectly crispy, very tasty, I would reorder from here JUST for the wings. Over all, not the best I've ever had, but definitely not the worst. Good value for the price."}
