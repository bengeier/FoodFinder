{"text":"This food truck recently appeared in the Albertsons parking lot. I've seen it on both weekends and weekdays, and it's a nice alternative for those in the backends of Anthem who are craving some BBQ but don't want to drive out to Lucille's."}
{"text":"Trying to find this food truck/trailer is like trying to find the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  I've never been able to find it.  However, their sauce is sold in a few of the grocery stores in the area, including Glazier's Food Marketplace on Durango.  They have a few different flavors.  I love the \"Sweet It Is\" flavor.  It is a smoky, sweet flavor with a slight bite.  It's some of the best I've ever had.  I hope to try it on some of their BBQ someday.  It would be nice if they had a website saying where they were going to be each day."}
{"text":"I just went on a unsuspecting grocery store run and ran into this trailer. My inner foodie was so excited I had to try it. 

The line wasn't long at all and it took less than 3 mins from the time I ordered to get my food. They have sandwiches (~$8 each), racks of ribs, brisket, chicken, and about 5 different sauces you can get on your meat. There was also someone inside Albertsons giving out samples of the meat and sauces. 

I ordered the brisket sandwich and was surprised when it came out in a bag. I wanted to eat it then and there but it looked so messy drenched in sauce I decided to wait until I got home. 

The sandwich was huge just stuffed with meat; I could only eat 1/2 of it. The bun was nice and soft. The meat was tender and juicy. It fell apart nicely and had a beautiful brown color. For me, it was really salty and that's part of the reason I could only eat 1/2 of it. I really wanted to like it, especially since I love food trucks and unsuspecting finds, but it was honestly just okay. I'm not too sure if I'd order again from here. But it was nice to try it at least once."}
