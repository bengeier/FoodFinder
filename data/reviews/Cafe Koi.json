{"text":"A much smaller place than I expected but inviting nonetheless. Seats at the bar were offered and accepted.  My wife had the Ginger Beef appy and found it way too salty with way more sauce than necessary. If you like ginger, you'll get lots with this order. I had the Koi Club Sandwich with a side of salad. Very small breast of chicken but tasty. Nice venue for local musicians but after our first visit, I probably wouldn't recommend it for dinner."}
{"text":"If I find myself constantly craving a dish at a restaurant, it deserves 5 stars in my books!  And crave I do...their delicious Warrior Bowl, consisting of Spolumbo's chicken apple sausage, crispy veggies, jasmine rice, and sticky chili maple sauce.  The rice and veggies are always cooked to perfection and the sauce is to die for.  Heaven in a bowl, honestly.    Aside from the Warrior, I have never been disappointed in a meal at Koi, ever.  Their soups are always delicious, no matter what the soup of the day is.  All of the food consists of fresh ingredients and delicious flavour combinations.    Very vegetarian & vegan friendly, with enough meat on the menu to satisy meatatarians, I highly recommend Koi!"}
{"text":"While the food at Koi tries very hard to be trendy fusion/West-coast, by far the best part of this eatery is the lively night activity going on outside the building. I found it to be a really difficult place to dine with more than 2 people, and the lighting left a lot to be desired. It is a very 'cool' place, well decorated and all that. I found the offerings to be nothing special though, and felt the seafood I ordered was slightly underdone."}
{"text":"This is a great place, especially for a few girls beginning their night out or a first date. It doesn't offer much space for large groups, which is probably a good thing as it would take away from the lounge bar effect.   My first encounter with Koi was a palate energizing experience! Their menu is substantial with lots to choose from, yet I did not feel overwhelmed with the array of options. With appetizers like \"Double Dipper\" and \"If I were Ginger Beef\" (my personal favourite), it was almost hard to move onto something else as I didn't want the flavour to dissipate.   Needless to say, I went ahead and decided to go with the \"Shinobi Salmon Bowl\", a very satisfying portion of coconut curry rice and Thai roasted salmon. The flavours danced around my mouth in a joyous reunion, they were just meant to be!  My husband had the \"Szechuan Chili Fire Bowl\" that had just the right amount of fire to complement the tiger prawns, portobello mushrooms and the best Shanghai noodles we have tasted in Calgary (yes we taste each others meals).  By the time we ordered dessert (Green Tea Ice Cream with shaved chocolate and fruit, YUM), the Saturday night Dj started playing the perfect mix of new and old, all with his own unique spin, literally. Excellent atmosphere, wonderful food and some of the best musical talent coming through the door.   Be sure to check their website for a listing of their open mic nights, Dj's and special entertainment. They have also added a vegetarian menu so I can now eat dinner with my veggie pal without missing out on my protein!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food! Great service! Atmosphere is cozy! And the live music is always on point! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Rating: **** (out of 5 *) Food: *** 1/2 Service: **** Decor: **** Bottom Line:  A cozy, funky space with friendly staff and an Asian-centric menu.  I would definitely go here again for lunch in downtown.  I have passed by this place a few times now and finally had  chance to try it out for a corporate lunch with a group of 12.    Food: As the restaurant's name suggests, the menu is definitely Asian-centric with quite a number of Vegetarian and Gluten-Free options.  We started off with a few appetizers: edamame beans, gyozas, ginger beef and some sort of salmon dish.  I found these to be tasty but a little on the small side portion-wise.  I ordered one of their Signature Bowls, the Bonsai Beef, which what stood out for me.  It was a health amount of sliced AAA sirloin beef over a bed of chili Szechuan noodles and mixed vegetables.  The beef was cooked perfectly and it had a great balance of sweetness and heat for the noodles.  I would definitely order this again.  Service: The staff were friendly and attentive, especially considering the size of our group.  The food came out in a reasonable time.  Decor: I liked the ambiance.  It gives off a chill and funky vibe.  Although it's a smaller space it doesn't feel cramped like other places."}
{"text":"My first time here was for an open mic Night and it was super. People from different ages and genres performed. It was a really neat experience. The food was great as well and the staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Cafe Koi. I went here because I wanted to go to a vegetarian friendly place that was near the Telus Convention Center. They accommodated my sister and I despite the fact that they were about to host an event and my sister arrived late. They were really friendly, and the food that we got was SOOOO good! My sister got the Buddha burger, and I got the Lotus bowl. When we were looking over the menu my sister asked me if I minded her getting a burger, and I said no. Then I noticed she ordered the Buddha burger, and I decided to refrain from pointing out that she order a vegan black bean burger! She LOVED it! I loved the Lotus bowl too! The sauce was worth the award it has won in the past! They also take $2 off of vegetarian meals on Monday nights which was an added bonus.  I also think it is great that the support the local community music scene and have a couple of open mic nights a week.  I definitely recommend checking this place out if you are in downtown Calgary!"}
{"text":"I came to this place for a friends birthday dinner. When I got there I was a little taken back by how small the place is. I don't know if it ever gets busy here but if it did, you would definitely have to wait for a table. The atmosphere is quiet laid back and very trendy. Low lighting makes it quite intimate.   The service was horrible! We had reservations, and our drinks were taken quiet quickly, yet when it came to ordering our dinner, that took nearly 30 minutes to be taken! We had to keep eyeing the waitress to get her attention but she seemed far too occupied but whatever message her friends where sending her as she kept showing her phone to other waitresses. We were also a little surprised that the waitress did not write down our order. However, there were no problems with our order either so that doesn't effect much.  The food was delish!!!! Definitely worth the visit, besides the poor service. I had the Dr. Phangs Beef and Broccoli, and it was so good. very large portions and very filling. I'm pretty sure my whole table was satisfied with our orders.  This review is only get 3 stars due to the services, had we had better service, this could of been a 4 (possibly 5) star review."}
{"text":"Lots of yummy Vegan choices plus dessert!  Great service! Bit small for bands - the live music was too loud so we had to rush our meal to get out, even though I love live bands. Disappointed it is closed on a Sunday."}
{"text":"I would have given a 2.5 rating if I could. I really wanted to love this restaurant! The food was good, simple but delicious (tried the tiger claw bowl) but presentation wasn't great. We went on Wednesday night at 6:30 pm, it was not busy yet our food (two bowls) took at least 30 minutes to arrive. The waitress brought by a pitcher of water and reassured us our food would be out shortly, then avoided us until it arrived 20 minutes later. I have worked in a lot of bars and restaurants, if you have bill times exceeding 20 minutes on a simple dish (especially when it is not busy) your customers are generally not going to be impressed. Also the environment was a bit uncomfortable: we sat next to the window which was freezing cold and next to the door, and the table was a really odd height. Not very comfortable. The hall to the washroom was blocked by a huge stack of chairs I had to squeak by. I would go here again just for the delicious food, but with no expectations for an \"experience\"."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out and listen to jazz.   The staff are great and the regulars will chat you up just for showing up, that's a nice change in YYC. Limited wine list, but decent enough to pass. I liked their approach to a mojito (when I passed on the wine list), super refreshing.  Needs more comfortable chairs so you can hang out longer but the food was very nice."}
{"text":"The food, ambiance and service are all incredible.  I always get their salmon noodle bowl, and it's always delicious. They have great desserts, and amazing wine.  It's a great place to gave wine and dessert with friends, or have a first (or third) date.   One more thing, they make this amazing drink (I can't recall the name), it's Jack Daniels, Root Beer, and cloves.  It's extremely excellent. Provided you like all of those things."}
{"text":"I had been at Cafe Koi on a date for drinks but glanced at the menu (and eyed all the food flying past) that I knew I had to come back to try some dishes out myself.  The atmosphere here is quite different from night to day. It has big open windows that really brighten and warm up the place.  I already had my heart set on trying the Tiger Claw (prawns lightly cooked in a signature coconut curry w/ basil and seasonal vegetables) before I even stepped foot back into the venue not even a week later.   It's not to busy during lunch (I guess it's off the beaten path for the usual downtown crowd) and I kinda liked the quietness.  I love bright colored food. It looks so much more inviting, and it somehow tricks me into eating my veggies lol  My dish was a coconut explosion - creamy broth served on coconut rice? Incredible!  Whether you're looking for a fun place for a date night or a quiet lunch, Koi caters to both your needs."}
{"text":"Love the vegetarian options at this restaurant. Large portions and very reasonable prices for the fresh food you are getting. I'd recommend making reservations during peak times"}
{"text":"It's a Thursday evening. You want to go out, have a few drinks, listen to some chilled out live music, be able to have a conversation and sit down in a relaxed environment. Because sitting is the best. Where to go?  Thursday night is Cafe Koi's 'Jazz 'N More Open Mic' - where local singers and a house band take the stage in a chilled out lounge bar setting. There was a mix of talent overall, generally within the good to pretty good range. The crowd ranged from some in their 20s and 30s, and around half were an older crowd. What I liked was overall everyone was silent or fairly quiet during each set, respecting each singer.  There's table service and we were offered the option to order food as the kitchen was still open when we arrived (the menu looked super tasty but we'd already eaten). They have a bunch of cocktails (2oz for $9 - not bad!), local Wild Rose beers on tap ($6.50 for 16oz pints) and wine, including a plum wine which is super tasty! I highly recommend the 'Nectar' plum wine (2 ozs for $6) or the Lotus Flower cocktail.  We were able to walk right in and grab a table near the front at around 9, and the place was maybe 2/3 full. There's no cover, but they do ask for a contribution during one of the breaks and have a bucket that they leave at the front by the stage.   If you're a fan of jazz, open mic and local music, and like it served with some Asian influenced tapas and cocktails it's a fun way to spend a few hours on a Thursday evening."}
{"text":"Great healthy food for a quick pick up order. I love the option to get extra veg instead of rice. It seems the prices went up since change of ownership?"}
{"text":"Every Thursday, my sister and I head to Koi after yoga for bowls, and every Thursday, I look forward to it.  Koi's a fun little spot that mixes live music and Asian inspired fair with a warm hole-in-the-wall atmosphere.  Like most restaurants I tend to frequent, this place is small. Unlike most restaurants I tend to frequent, this place takes reservations; so if you're thinking about heading there any day between Thursday and Saturday, make a reso or get there early.  I could talk about how the food is delicious and well balanced; how the $9 yam wedge appetizer has a dip I could drink and the vegetarian selection is wide and varied (Koi can spice and seer a mean tofu stick for it's $14 Lotus Bowl); but what makes Koi special is it's themed nights.  Thursday is open mic jazz night and the place is packed by 8 pm with delightfully talented local musicians. Fridays feature local DJs and Wednesday is comedy night.   Koi gets a solid 3 stars from me for one main reason; sometimes, my food is burnt; and in a place that has a good track record for having great food, this is a mistake that has happened enough that, regrettably, it cannot be overlooked.  However, that does not mean you shouldn't check out Koi, because you totally should, and you should totally have a Lotus Bowl.  T."}
{"text":"Cafe Koi, for me, is one of those places I've walked by about 20 times or so, but never had the drive to go in. Perhaps the reason was because my brain could not figure out what it was all about from the outside. Is it a coffee shop? Is it a restaurant? Is it a bar? I never could tell, so rather than find out I always ended up passing it by.   The menu is very Asian fusion. We had some gyoza, yam wedges and mussels. I also drank a few Gin and Tonics. The food was ok, I have had better gyoza and yam tempura. The mussels were the stars of the night. Very Delicious. The drinks were not very good unfortunately. I am not sure what kind of Gin the were using, but it didn't make a good G&T.  Possibly the drink didn't fit very well with the meal.   I found it an OK experience.  21/30 Yelp 30 Day Challenge"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to having lunch here after seeing the menu and a recommendation from a friend. I went for lunch and it was not busy at all. There were maybe 4 others tables of two occupied. The server ignored me for quite awhile, even after I called out \"Excuse me?\" a couple of times. Eventually she 'saw' me and said, \"Has anyone given you a menu?\" Ummmm.NO! I got a menu - with no apology (typical Calgary service). I ordered the Lotus Bowl after seeing it was 'award winning'. I didn't wait too long for it and the presentation was fine. But I was completely under-whelmed by the flavour. I couldn't quite figure out how 'five spiced tofu' had NO flavour - other than burnt! The veggies, rice and sauce were tasty - but the tofu was so bland I couldn't eat it all.   I had water to drink - can't really screw that up - except that the glass had the overpowering smell of bleach from whatever dishwasher detergent they use. I appreciate clean dishes - but not the bleach smell. More on the smell front - while I was eating they chose to light some nasty incense. Sorry folks - incense and food aren't a good mix.   I asked for the bill and it never came. Eventually got up and walked to the counter to pay and the girl acted like I had never asked for the bill at all.   Thought it was over-priced for what it was."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and a delight to find some healthier \"non-meat\" items on the menu. The place is small, but does not feel cramped. I can imagine waiting out front for a table in the winter months might not be a lot of fun, but on these summer evenings it would be rather pleasant. I had the Buddha Bowl which I was told was a customer favorite. The coconut curry was wonderful.    They have entertainment on different nights of the week. I had been told this night would feature a singer/songwriter, but was pleasantly surprised to hear a very young quartet of guys playing jazz. They had a good understanding of the genre and it kept me around for another glass of wine.   Speaking of wine; their list of wines is critically short. I tried the French Malbec as well as a Pinot Noir and both were quite nice. I would have preferred a Cab or Merlot, but the limited options were both acceptable.   The servers were really great and perhaps the highlight. They call everyone by name and had no problem remembering them. Nice touch."}
{"text":"Overpriced for what you get. Coconut curry \"the Buddha\" was bland, which is unacceptable for a $16 veggie dish. Everyone else in my party was equally unimpressed. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Perfect space to host an intimate event. I recently launched my new Show & Tell: An Artist Showcase event there for my Calgary Art Group and I could not have chosen a more suitable place. The environment was incredible, the atmosphere was perfect. The staff was so friendly, and the owners.. I can't thank them enough. They are so incredibly supportive of the Arts community in the first place (walls are always dressed with local art). But to open the door for my new event, I am grateful yes, but even more happy that they were so kind and opening the doors for me to offer this event each month there.   The space was big enough to have a good crowd but intimate enough to be able to hear everyone. There is a mini stage that they are all equipped  with all the electronics that I didn't have to worry. It was just perfect.  I have eaten there in the past from friends suggestions, which their food is so tasty, vegetarian or not you will love the food."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place, I wish I could come back every day. The people are amazing and sociable. They are great at helping pick out an entree and even help the tourists find great places to go! Don't miss out on the live shows every night!"}
{"text":"Cafe Koi is a very interesting place. It has a mood to it, so to speak. The vibe is laid back, lounge-like, and the lighting and music both make up a nice atmosphere.  The menu is quite expansive. Lost of appetizers, sandwiches, salads, and noodle/rice bowls. I ordered the Seoul Beef Noodle Bowl: chili-fire Shanghai noodles with grilled sirloin on top. It was fantastic. A couple of people with me had the Buddha Burger. It's a black bean and veggie burger which they seemed to really enjoy. I didn't have any of the house cocktails but they looked good too.  Apparently it turns into more of a lounge later at night, with live music and DJs. There's a small stage to the side of the eating area. I'd like to go back and check out some of the live music, and eat again too. Great spot."}
{"text":"Get the ninja bowl. There are no words for how good that salmon was. It's nice, quiet and small and in a good location. The food is excellent and the drinks are too. Good place for a date, but maybe not for a group of friends as the place is really tiny. I was here a few nights ago and I think I now have a new favorite dinner spot downtown."}
{"text":"Café Koi. You charming little establishment, you.   I really like it here.... There is delicious food, great local talent and really friendly staff. The first time I made the decision to stop by, I was unaware of how busy it gets... there was only standing room over by the bar and I wasn't feeling it so I left.   The second time I made sure to make reservations and tried some of the food. My friend and I shared the pork gyoza and bonsai beef bowl... both were really tasty - and when I asked for hot sauce, it came promptly! (The way to my heart is hot sauce... everyone knows this)  The only thing I would say that is a bit of a downfall is their wine by glass and beer selection. I feel like it could be so much more."}
{"text":"First time here. Nice contemporary small environment. Seems like lots of events occur as they have an event calendar. There were musicians there our night. I had shanghai noodles with steak in it, and to my surprise, the steak was actually cooked nicely (I think I had lower expectations, because this is not a steak house). The noodles were flavourful and had a good bounce to them. The presentation of food was nice, and it was overall yummy. However, when I reached the bottom of the bowl, the veggies became quite saucy and looked less appetizing, as it swarmed together. Perhaps during food preparation, the veggies could be placed to the surface more, so that they don't drown under the noodles and into the sauce, needing rescue later on. Servers were friendly, though sometimes water refills came too slow. A nice atmosphere, and I think I would try it again."}
{"text":"Totally overpriced perfectly fine but not outstanding food. You know those Japanese grill places they sometimes have in food courts in the mall? The ones where you pick your meat and your sauce (garlic bean sauce, or teriyaki, etc) and they cook it up for you on the griddle with fresh veggies and your choice of rice or noodles right there in front of you and it's usually really yummy and costs about $9.95 and you can't finish it 'cause it's just too much food for lunch? Well that's what the food at Cafe Koi is like, except that it's not that quick, the portions are smaller, and it costs about $17.00. I'm not saying the food was bad. The edemame was actually delicious. The service was nothing special, the ambiance is hard to comment on since I was seated with a view of the dishwasher's butt even though the place was empty. All in all, I just don't get the appeal or understand the high ratings for this place. It was really mediocre."}
{"text":"Terrific! Everything we orders was so good. Not open late enough if your looking for a night on the town. Waitress was very busy and rude"}
{"text":"Cafe Koi has such an intimate / romantic setting its lovely. The room is darkly lit, the noise level is quiet, and the service is nice and unobtrusive. Nothing about the place is pretentious, loud or overly-anything.   Their Buddha Bowl is amazing. It is a yellow curry bowl with lots of veggies and some thick slices of seared tofu, served with jasmine rice. The seared tofu was so so good, I am glad it came seared and not stir-fried. I love Thai influenced curries, and this one was absolutely delicious. It was like a warm hug from an old friend.   I went on a Monday night, not knowing it was Vegelicious Monday, so the 2$ discount on the bill was a pleasant surprise.  They also seem to have some live music acts, which I will definitely be checking out one of these days."}
{"text":"November Challenge - 28/30  Super friendly staff at Café Koi, even when the Café is packed to the gills full of smelly college kids getting their culture on during an otherwise quiet Monday evening.   I've been a few times before, but always for drinks or coffee. Monday night, I finally got to try one of their dishes. They were out of vegan burgers (what do you expect in a crowd full of Freshman philosophers?), so I opted for the Lotus Bowl. Normally, I can't stand stir fries, because it's the cop-out \"oh man, vegetarians are coming\" dish of gooey sadness I encounter in diners where nothing else is \"asian inspired.\"   However, the Lotus Bowl at Koi is full of delicious vegan goodness. Packed full of smoky grilled tofu, fresh veggies, a fragrant sauce and rice; the portion seems small at first, but I felt cozy and full after finishing it. The soup spoon they gave me to eat it with was kind of awkward to use, and it was too busy in Koi for me to want to get up and ask for more proper utensils, but I made do and it was tasty regardless.   Stop for the cocktails, stay for the Lotus Bowl! If you order a vegetarian entrée on Monday, it's $2 off. $1 off vegetarian appetizers on Monday, too!"}
{"text":"We were heading to the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra and and stumbled upon this cafe in downtown Calgary.  It is an Asian fusion cafe with live music and visual art from local artists.  Atmosphere: 4/5  I liked the decor and artwork in the cafe.  The live music performance of the night was just starting when we finished and it did get a little loud to talk esp being quite close to the stage, but overall a good and relaxed atmosphere.  There was some free street parking along the road after 6pm.   Food: 3.5/5  There were a number of menu options including vegetarian/vegan- some asian fusion appetizers, sandwiches, salads, but it seems like the bowls are most popular. I ordered the 'ninja food' bowl - thai salmon and vegetable rice bowl, which I thought was good overall.  The vegetables did get quite oily as I got to the bottom of the bowl though, but I also prefer lighter and perhaps more bland food.  Service: 3/5  Servers were polite and friendly.  It did take some time to order as they were also busy trying to get the performers set up on stage.  Overall: 4/5  I would return again to try some of the other bowls.  Maybe next time I would emphasize to go lighter on the sauce / oil.  I like the atmosphere of the cafe and it is quite conveniently located in downtown Calgary."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend of mine. Service is great, waitresses were very attentive and friendly. Food, although my salmon was cooked well, the curry was nothing special. It doesn't have any wow factor. In fact I would get thai curry elsewhere. It just wasn't spicy enough."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from this restaurant and both our rice and noodle dishes were delicious- spot on with the flavours, and you can tell the difference in the higher quality of meat that they use compared to alot of stir-fry bowl style dishes you get elsewhere. Made a huge difference. The sauce that comes with the veggie gyozas is fantastic as well."}
{"text":"I love the look and feel of Koi: dim lighting, obscure artwork, and the mid-energy music humming in the background. It is more of a date place rather than a cafe you could bring your laptop to and get some serious work done.  Their coffee is great and has a bit of a snap to it. Great for when you want to have serious business discussions. But make sure your companion isn't having one their many cocktails. This one time I was here some guy was drunkenly pouring his heart out to this girl who was clearly there to squeal about her other fella. The world is a soap opera: yuck.  I liked some of the dishes I've tried there in the past. Their double dipper bean and roasted garlic hummus are great appetizers to share. And I had a bit of their buddha bowl, also an excellent choice. But personally I never found their drinks that strong. The mint mojito was great but I wouldn't choose this place for drinks.  They have a stage available for performances and presentations. I've gone here for a few intimate music concerts and open mics, as well as a few readings. Maybe if my work held it's quarterly meeting here no one would fall asleep.  Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 26/30"}
{"text":"I went here with my wife the other day. There was a great ambiance as we walked in, and the place was not busy. The lighting was low enough to be intimate, and the decor was good for this type of restaurant. Chairs were comfortable, and the tables were good.  The menu was great. I have recently been enjoying vegetarian cuisine, and I was happy to find that the veggie options were highlighted on the back of the menu. Besides this, the veggie options were also in-line with the regular food, so you can judge each dish on its own merits, rather than being of a binary mindset (do I eat vegetarian, or not?)  My wife had a curry noodle bowl, which she enjoyed, but the price was a little higher than it needed to be. I ordered the Buddah Burger. After reading all the great reviews, how could I not? I enjoyed the burger immensely, and the addition of beets and caramelized onions added a lot of life to the black bean burger, stuffed into a hearty pita (pausing for salivary gland recuperation).  This was truly a great lunch item, and it will be hard to pass by this on the menu next time I go back.   Server was attentive, and the bottled water was a nice touch. The kitchen seemed a touch slow for serving a quick lunch, but I would absolutely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a good healthy meal. This is, in my mind, the essence of what food should be. Vegetarian, or otherwise, this place is a definite hit."}
{"text":"Tofu Ginger is something amazing. My fiance thought it was chicken it was spiced that well; meat eaters and even the 'I hate all vegetables and eat only meat' jocks will become believers!  Everything is fresh, organic, and delicious.   Think of this as the upscale version of Edo Japan. It is rice bowls and such.  Be sure to come on a night with live performances, but make reservations and come with an understanding that the service may be slower on those nights.  It's funny I have walked past this place many times while at Cafe Med or Vicious Circle; never went in - I always assumed it was Sushi. Glad I did."}
{"text":"The occasion was my dipping my toes into singing jazz. I was one of the 5 featured singers and all of us had brought our cheering team so the place was fully booked. Despite the fact that everyone more or less arrived around showtime the servers were efficient and professional and food took probably a little more time to arrive but not that long that you noticed. The food was delicious, the menu offers a good variety for those who are wanting vegan or gluten-free options. I opted to start with the Lantern rolls Baked spring rolls w/ mushrooms, carrots, suey choy, spring onions and chilli plum dipping sauce. Though they were baked they still had crunch and worked well with the plum dipping sauce. I also had a taste of my friend's Kimchi Salmon, make sure you give it a good mix or you may get a whole lot of salty Kim Chi which wasn't too pleasant but once balanced off with the other ingredients the dish was good. I didn't want to sing on a full stomach so waited till after my set to order Miss Shanghai Vegan noodles and seasonal vegetables tossed in szechwan chili-fire sauce.The noodles were perfect, al dente and well-tossed in a tasty sauce. I didn't find the heat very spicy but then I eat extremely spicy food so for me it was probably between a mild to medium but very nice. I would definitely order this dish again and find that I didn't miss not having any meat in it. The place is intimate and cozy and Cafe Koi supports local musicians and artists with their daily events of either open mics or other presentations. The only beef I have is that there is only street parking and on a weekend can be pretty hard to come by."}
{"text":"Very tasty super healthy food! I really enjoyed the fresh veggies, jasmine rice and awesome portion sizes. The cocktails are awesome. We went when there was live music such a cute little restaurant! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"*FORGET DISNEYLAND*   Koi  This is the best place to go for a light hearty meal.   I am a vegetarian (all my life) and was diagnosed with Celiac's disease after years of testing. Of coarse my first reaction was relief of pin-pointing my health problems but reading Gluten-free books I felt boxed in with limited option's for food choices and going out to eat.  I must confess I relied on Pasta and Wheat products that weaning  it out of my daily diet was taking the enjoyment of my eating experience away and going to be a challenge.    My mother & I decided on Koi because I get free parking across the way (I work down town). I was delightfully surprised to get a seat right away on a Friday night.  We ordered the 'double dipper' (Corn Nachos with Feta cream & Black bean salsa). I've never been a fan of black beans but the way the Salsa is marinaded with exotic fruits & harvest veggies I was practically licking the bowl!   Both our main dishes were perfectly cooked and decent per-portions. Believe it or not they have Vegetarian dishes and Gluten free options.   \"Finally I can eat out again and Not fear getting sick!!!\"  I must also comment on the staff who have been easy going, helpful and understanding about my food choices. Unlike most places they roll their eyes or give me a look to say \"thanks lady, for making my job a little more difficult today!\"  Koi also offers late nights, live music, local comedy shows, unknown struggling artist painting and promotes Vegetarian lifestyle... which means a lot to me."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have a variety of live music nights which is awesome. The small restaurant is quaint yet modern. Menu is Asian fusion and they have lots of vegan friendly options. I wish Cafe Koi was open on Sunday's!"}
{"text":"Koi is a great place for some trendy food during the lunch hour.  If you work down town Calgary, there's no reason not to pop over and try out Cafe Koi. I had a great curry dish served with rice that was featured on their gluten free menu. The curry had great rich flavours and was served in a perfect amount for lunch time. I hope to get back to try out some more food as soon as possible.  The staff at Koi were all very nice and can make a very good mojito. The prices were very fair especially considering how close they are to the down town core."}
{"text":"I had a great meal, and a great time here.  Food was great, chief was flexible, staff was superb. Price was reasonable.  The best part was after dinner, a quintet played Mozart and other classical selections.  My new favorite place in Calgary."}
{"text":"so - part 2 of my friday night in calgary this past weekend...  We showed up around 11.30pm and the place was rocking with a couple DJ's setup by the bar.  Not very crowded, but it's also not such a big place.  DJ's were fantastic and handing out CD's which was nice - especially when the music is decent.  Cool, loungey decor and comfortable seating...  The menu looked interesting but the kitchen wasn't open when we showed.  Drinks were reasonably priced and for what it's worth, the lighting was super low so I became really attractive all of a sudden when we walked into the spot...bonus points!  Worth a trip to check out the food and feel more attractive."}
{"text":"Decent food, but the bowls weren't too unique.  We ordered 4 of the 6 vegetarian bowls and they were all very similar in flavor profiles and veggie make up.  Lighting was too dark and it was very dead on Monday.  Service was attentive.  Priced a little expensive."}
{"text":"Love all the vegetarian and vegan options here! It also has a really nice, cozy but chic ambiance. First off, I really liked that I was seated very quickly (made a reservation for 5:30pm). Since it was fairly empty at the time, I could choose the table I wanted.  I ordered the lotus bowl with tofu ($15) and replaced the rice with veggies (1.50 extra). There were snow peas, bell peppers, bok choy, mushrooms, onions, lotus root and a lot of delicious sauce at the bottom. I really liked this dish, it was flavorful, and the chili sauce really complemented the sauce! I also felt quite healthy eating this which was a plus! It was brought our fairly quickly after I ordered and piping hot. The only qualm I had was that it was a bit too oily for my liking.  They have rotating desserts which I thought was quite neat. Today they had this chocolate mousse and a raspberry macaron. I ordered the macaron ($9). It was a bit expensive for what it was, a single large raspberry macaron with chocolate sauce, coconut flakes and a creamy whip cream center between the 2 cookies. It was really good and fresh, but again, not really worth $9 (note: my favorite macarons come from Laduree in Paris, and they're only 2.25 pounds each).  Overall, it was good but not amazing. Great service though!"}
{"text":"Great food with lots of vegetarian options for my friend. The Buddha Bowl is really good. Super fun musicians unlike anyone I've ever seen before. A band with really unique instruments. Then we saw a super talented singer who was recording sounds she made, and then playing them as her own beats!  It got pretty crowded around the time the band went on, so we were glad to have had been there already to get a table."}
{"text":"This is a sleek urban brainchild from Vancouver based Philip Wong. Koi is a wonderful accessible lounge bar ambient rich in darker colors and minimal teak-like furniture.  Koi has a great selection of really good cocktails, martinis and drink specials but I love the 300 ml option of crisp chilled organic sake or the 300 mil option of plum wine with rich spicy citrus undertones at just under $25.  The food menu is just as impressive with roasted beet salads, roasted chicken, penne feta, citrus salmon sandwiches, teriyaki steak sandwich and signature bowls of salmon and coconut curry.  Koi is also a venue for those of you who want to feature your artwork, they have a new artist showing every month and Koi does not take any commission on works that they help the artist sell.  Philip then wraps the food, art and drink with live music and performance; every night features something fresh and new. On Tuesdays come and support new singers at an open mike session, on Thursday drink sake and listen to jazz, and on Friday and Saturdays, get down with the freshest DJ sounds.  The staff and owner here are quite lovely and I love the community spirit and support Philip wants to highlight.  The food is delicious the drinks are scrumptious and the talent just sick, check it all out at Koi!"}
{"text":"Great service, different ambiance. I enjoyed the service, and quality of their coffee / cakes/ desserts were all very good. It has an artistic theme, with lots live music events. Very cozy environment and friendly staff. I'm going back."}
{"text":"Not only does Koi offer an expansive and varied food and beverage menu in a comfortable, intimate space, it also does a lot to foster community and the arts, with a couple of different open mic nights each week in addition to other musical performances, DJ nights, improv theater performances, etc.  I'm impressed by all that Koi has to offer, and plan to spend a fair bit of time here (then again, I have a bad habit of saying such things and then somehow forgetting all about the place for a year, so we'll see what happens...)"}
{"text":"My friends and I usually come here for their open mic nights, its something fun to do on a weeknight (we especially like the Tuesday night singer songwriter open mic) and the food is pretty good too.   They have a lot of vegan, gluten free and vegetarian options. I usually get their bowls my favorites are the Tiger Claw, Lotus and Crouching Tiger. During one of our visits here the waitress suggested a vegan smoothie and it was amazing! This place has Good food, service and music."}
{"text":"Seems sweet, live music. Cute place.  Never any fucking tables open.  Am I gonna make reservations?  Hell no, place is crammed tighter than Asian transit"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The owners are super friendly and the servers as well. I played here for an open mic a few times, and I would come back any day.  The vibe is so chill and low key, it's great. Music sign up starts at 7pm and there are generally quite a few spots available throughout the evening.  Looking for a great place to hang out on a Tues night? Order some drinks and desserts and you're in for a great evening."}
{"text":"Low lighting - one of my favourite qualities in a restaurant. That way when you walk in, you can be immersed in the atmosphere the restaurant takes time and energy to create. Maybe you can't see distinguishable features on the faces in the room, maybe you'll notice there is a live DJ spinning 10 minutes after you get there. The menu always seems more exciting when you have to squint to read it - the dark is more intimate.   I walked into Cafe Koi today at high noon - and the dark room was refreshing, although we did grab the seats by the window. It was a seat yourself, counter service kind of lunch - drop your bag and head up to the menu printed on the wall. The girls are the front were chipper - they handed us a wine bottle of water and two cups.   I had the roasted beet salad - fantastic. Fresh greens, feta cheese, pine nuts (possibly) and of course, roasted beets. Yes, I am a person who love beets. The salad was about $13 - but it was a full size salad with pita bread on the side. It was filling but not over filling - which is good because I'm practising the virtue of temperance lately."}
{"text":"I visited Cafe Koi for the first time tonight. I've often passed it, but never had occasion to go in. The interior was dimly lit and simply decorated. I liked the ambiance.  The service was prompt and friendly, and the entire place was pretty low key and quiet while we were there, although I think they were getting ready for some kind of performer as we were getting ready to leave.  We ordered some cocktails and appys (pork gyoza, yam wedges, fried tofu and mussels). Cocktails were around the $6.50 mark (I had The Duke-JD and root beer, and an extra spicy Caesar), on par for the price. The appys were all also around the $10 mark, though I'm not sure that four of them were quite enough for the table. The entrees at another table looked more plentiful. I've heard good things about the Buddha Burger, I think I'll be back to try a full meal at Cafe Koi next time!  Yelp's 30 Day Challenge: 2/30"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance and food of this restaurant! Not to forget the amazing and friendly staff and daily musical entertainment! The service is quick and they are celiac friendly! Highly recommend this restaurant to those who enjoy down to earth staff and amazing asian fusion inspired food! AND don't forget to try the macaroons, they're amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Review #23 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012  I work a block away from Cafe Koi so it's officially my go to place if I don't pack a lunch and I don't want to think much about what to eat. Most work days I only eat in my office so I like that I can call ahead to place an order and pick it up after a few minutes. Every time I call, someone cheerful and polite answers to take my order - They're pretty good at taking orders over the phone as I've never had to repeat myself and they always get my orders and requests right. I think their food is ok - nothing in particular stands out but nothing is bad that would turn me away. The seafood curry in particular isn't the tastiest curry I've had but I like that it has a lot of seafood and veggies that keep me full for the rest of my work day."}
{"text":"Tasty veggie gyoza, nice huge zen salad with a tangy lemon dressing. Literally blinked and the room was packed with live music about to start but I had to jet. Next time I'll stay longer !"}
{"text":"cute restaurant.  veggielicious mondays are my favourite kind of mondays. koi has a page on their menu of just vegetarian things (and the friendly staff are usually quite aware of what is vegan or what can be altered). on mondays, the veggie entrees are $2 less, and the appetizers $1 less, which is just lovely. if you are a first timer at koi and looking for some vegetarian fare, i would totally recommend the veggie gyoza, and the buddha bowl. their drinks are also awesome, and i'd reccomend checking them out on their nights where they host live music."}
{"text":"Although I'm not a vegetarian, I'm absolutely addicted to Koi's Buddah Burger with a side of yams. Everything always tastes fresh and complex. I love that I can order a pot of jasmine tea with any meal. I love the Asian influence.  The atmosphere is modern and it's easy to find a spot for lunch hour meetings without having to book ahead. The food does take a while sometimes, but it's always worth the wait."}
{"text":"We visited this place after a satisfying sushi meal - a friend of mine was DJ'ing some deep house, and we stopped in to check him out. The mood in the restaurant is very sensual: lots of low lighting, tables and chairs close by, very intimate. We did not order any food, but had coffees and chais. I thought the chai latte was the closest I've had to a cup of real, home-made chai since Kat and I visited our friend in Vancouver and began every morning with delicious tea made in front of our eyes. My coffee-snob friend, whose Venti 6-pump no water Chai at Starbucks is apparently the final word on chai, was not impressed with his - don't listen to him! If their food is as good as their chai, I am anxious to try it out. Oh and my friend's set was very nice."}
{"text":"Sorry to update my review to a 1 star, but I will NEVER go to Cafe Koi again. My boyfriend and I went on a Monday night (because of their Meatless Monday Special) and had assumed (wrongly) that it would end up being a cheap to medium priced night.   First off at 6 pm the place was pretty dead. There was 1 waitress and she was not very attentive at all. It took forever for her to give us menus, and then forever for her to come back and take our order.   We only ordered 3 things and water, she didn't write anything down and she ended up forgetting one of them (our appetizer!)  We ordered the vegetable gyoza's, a Buddha burger, and a panda bowl with the addition of Koi spiced tofu.   Even though there were only 3 other tables, our food took a long time to come. When it finally did, I was shocked. Where is our appetizer? Someone else brought out our food and told the waitress later she forgot it. She didn't seem too concerned, more like an \"oh whoops... well did you still want it?\" Wow nice attitude!   The Buddha burger is kind of ridiculous for a vegetarian option. It's served on this naan like flatbread and cannot be made vegan because of the dairy used in the bread. They have no other options, and seriously don't care that only lacto-vegetarians or omnivores can order it. My boyfriend didn't really like it anyway because who wants to eat a veggie burger on flat bread? Probably should be removed from the menu or served on a vegan friendly traditional bun, not the same bread used for their chicken flat bread sandwich.   I ordered the Panda bowl on the waitress's recommendation, as I had previously tried the Buddha Bowl (which was nice, a large size and comes with tofu and a side of rice).  What I received was a tiny bowl of vegetables with shredded carrots, topped with my side of Koi spiced tofu. I was pretty disappointed in the serving size and was still hungry after I finished. Who makes a menu item just of steamed vegetables in sauce?  Finally our vegetable gyoza's arrived. They were pretty greasy and only ok in flavor. Not worth $9 either.    So far the overall experience was very disappointing. But that's not even the worst part. The manager came over and said he would discount the gyoza's for us because they were missed and we thought oh ok, thanks that's nice.   Looking at the bill I was absolutely shocked...  $2 was taken off the 2 entrees because of the standard Meatless Monday Special -ok, but the \"side\" of 3 tiny strips of tofu cost $4 on top of a dish that was already $16 for a tiny bowl of vegetables. In what world is a side of tofu $4? It's not like it's advertised as organic even. And the gyozas were only discounted $1 in total! They were already supposed to come with a $1 discount for the Meatless Monday special, but I guess the waitress again did not care. So really we received no discount at all for her forgetting appetizer, unlike what we were told by the manager.   The whole meal for 3 items with no drinks, after discount was still over $42, and we left hungry and unhappy. That is far too much to pay for just small portions of vegetables and bread.   I just don't understand why the Buddha bowl costs less less than the Panda bowl with tofu added. The Buddha bowl is a coconut vegetable curry, which comes with tofu and a side of rice, and the panda bowl is just a smaller bowl of vegetables with no rice and no tofu. It doesn't make any sense and it is not clear on the menu that it is a small portion.   This whole experience soured me from ever returning to Cafe Koi, any time I'm downtown it will be The Coup, even though it's busy the waitresses are infinitely superior.   Cafe Koi is nothing but a dark \"cafe\" that charges high prices for bad service and small portions and nickels and dimes for everything.  Not worth being ripped off again, sorry."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for quite some time now and finally made it out for jazz night. The food is super tasty, but it does work out to be fairly pricey. Good quality, just not somewhere one would go all the time based on price. Really great service, the girls were lovely and friendly. Appreciated their suggestions on dishes as we had never been there before. Nice atmosphere. All in all very happy with my trip here."}
{"text":"disclaimer - i liked koi so much, that i threw my wedding after party here.    why koi is amazing is the result of attention to particular details.  i am picky in general, but it is in this pickiness that i find that there is indeed, a place that gets it.  koi is the balance of culture, food and community that makes it a place that is of appeal to me.  it isn't just the delicious food, it isn't just the artwork or the live musicians that play and display there.  it's a combination of everything and i def love this joint.  feel good vibes abound, deliciousness and audible delectables."}
{"text":"I told my mum I went to eat here and she assumed Koi was a sushi restaurant.  Don't be fooled!  Koi is delicious and vegetarian friendly, while not ostracizing people who do like meat, which I feel can happen at the Coup. It is also a bonus because they do take reservations, so I booked a table online a week in advance. We were seated right in the window nook, which was nice and private and I was next to a heating vent, which made me happy after having walked to Koi from Bankview. The lone TV was playing My Fair Lady, which prompted my Fiance to quietly sing along.  I decided it was a cocktail night, so I had the spicy ceaser, wishing well (sake, gin, lychee) and a amaretto sour. The amaretto sour comes with a sugar dusted rim, but by our third round, the rim wasn't dusted anymore and the Fiance's drinks kept being taken away before they were finished. Though that could be blamed on his quiet English accent.  We shared the roasted garlic hummus and the crispy ginger tofu-chuks, both were amazing. The ginger tofu-chuks were a crispy party in my mouth. I know Koi is notable for it's signature bowls, so I ordered the Sea of Happiness bowl, coconut curry heaven with a variety of tasty sea creatures: shrimp, mussels and salmon. I very much appreciated the proper cleaning of the mussels too, it's always a bonus not to have sand in your food.  We then shared the coffee cake that vanished very quickly from the plate.  We both really enjoyed our meal, the service was speedy, though not super friendly which is why I am keeping Koi to a four star, that and the drink theft!  In addition to being a great place to dine, Koi hosts open mic nights on Tuesdays and Thursdays and Mondays the vegetarian dishes are discounted!  I need to make the trip over to Koi more often!  Review #25 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge"}
{"text":"My fiance and I used to go to Cafe Koi a lot, and have always enjoyed our time there.  The ingredients are fresh, and inspired, the service is trendy, and the space is relaxing.    I love that they put cranberries in their water. Everytime we go we usually order the same thing:  Ninja Food or the Szechwan Chili Fire Bowl.  I love the salmon in the Ninja Food.      Always leave there feeling full, but happy."}
