{"text":"Incredibly friendly staff, very reasonable prices and maybe the best spicy salmon maki I've ever had. I come here on almost a weekly basis for take out."}
{"text":"Great maki! I only had maki here, so that is, of course, what I'm basing my review on. The salmon and avocado roll was great. The salmon was extremely fresh and had a nice color to it. The plating was standard. 

The veggie roll (can be upped to a veggie dragon, which just adds avocado on top) was great, but not perfect. I think the asparagus was cooked before it was deep fried, which I've never seen before. So its flavor kind of came out more than it should have. But other than that it was delicious.

All in all this is a nice restaurant with a warm interior, kind staff, and great maki :)"}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets in Toronto for sushi!  Staff are friendly and always happy, service is quick, prices are reasonable and food is great.  LOVE this place!!"}
{"text":"I've gotten sick here twice... the food is great going in, not so great coming out. It sucks that I have to find somwhere else because the staff is so friendly."}
{"text":"We sat there at the sushi bar for 20mins staring at our menu's and by the time the
waitress came by we had to return to the office so didnt have a chance to try the food.
Not a great revue sorry but if you are in a rush better try somewhere else...

{"text":"Beware - worst customer service I have ever encountered. These people have no manners whatsoever. 

Ordered over the phone, came to pick up only to find out they misheard and messed up my order. I was nice and calm about it... Ask if I could get a side of whatever else I was expecting and that I would pay for this oder anyway plus the rest.. Was told a big no and that it's not possible. 

They offered no solutions, blamed me for the mistake (or their poor English understanding of my order?) and made such a situation out of it... It was ridiculous. Three employees ganged up on me at the counter with elevated voices and continued to make me feel like an idiot and like I know nothing about Japanese food or ordering food. I'd say they're the ones who don't know how to properly run a Japanese restaurant. The older lady who works there was the rudest... The owner I assume? She was literally laughing and telling me off and then turned her back to me and stopped listening.

Because I have manners and that I am civilized I paid for my food regardless of their ridiculous behavior and mistakes. Never going back again."}
{"text":"A small restaurant with friendly staff and a family-like ownership at the helm. This is a perfect alternative to Sushi Inn in nearby Yorkville. Here, the food is fairly priced and attractively displayed--even for my take-put order. The food is generously and appropriately portioned.

The dining room is small and spare. It is friendly and clean but with a modest atmosphere. It is quite utilitarian, but is certainly pleasant and is not depressing if you eat in the restaurant itself.

An excellent addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Very small resto. Great for a quick sushi pick up. Most of the hot food is microwaved. When I went, a bit annoying. The fire alarm went off in the building and the waiters didn't acknowledged it. Should have given a discount due to the distruption. Anyways... it's made in house but microwaved."}
{"text":"I live across the road. Nijo is my go to place to dine with neighbors. Friendliness and fine service every time I visit. Of course great food!"}
{"text":"Pricy food with low portion. The lunch bento box food portion is significantly less than other Japanese restaurants. The katsu Don was so dry. Not recommend!"}
{"text":"What the hell happened to this place?!

I grew up in the area and tried my first sushi here for the first time in my life over 15 years ago and I can't go without for longer than a week since.

Last time I came here was last year and it was very good as always. However, I came back today and had the worst experience!

I entered through the back around 3pm, the place was less than half full and I asked for a table for 1. Plenty of seats in the back and server directs me to a teeny table at the front beside a service table where the menus and utensils are. I asked politely if it's okay to sit at the back and the server says NO indignantly and points to the teeny table speaking to me like I'm her disobedient child WTF. So I shrugged it off and said I'll get take out instead and she says FINE and rudely hands me the menu WTF. I kept calm the whole time and maybe she was having a bad day but her attitude is simply unacceptable! The owners/ other servers saw her treat me this way and said nothing. I patiently waited for my food and left.

The food itself was fresh as always, but today my chirashi was missing the avocado and bits of mushroom. I always have chirashi here every time I come. I still enjoyed the tamago. I've always liked how their chirashi had the little extra stuff other places don't normally have.

However, I will not be coming back here again. I've had my share of poor customer service in life but only once or twice have I felt as mistreated and unfairly at as I did today. I am very sad considering this place introduced me to my love of sushi!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Go here about once a week. I have been to many Japanese places and this has to be my favourite. The amount of sushi they give you is ridiculous, they give you more fish than rice.

I usually get a lunch combo for $13 and it always last me 2 meal and the fish is always fresh."}
{"text":"My boyfriend works near here and he always gets food from here so thought I'd try it out as well. If you order take out and pay with cash, you get 10% off! 

We ordered the salmon lover and tuna lover. It comes with 8pc each and about 4 pieces of sashimi placed in a rose pattern. The fish was fresh and delicious overall. They had fried sweet potato bits on top too, which I loved. 

The food was ready within 10 minutes of ordering over the phone (around 2pm), which is super fast, given no one was in the restaurant. Not sure how their other food is, and it is a bit pricey ($13-14 each set), but would definitely order it again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Heads up:  This restaurant has changed owners and chefs as of September 2014. It really is a completely different restaurant.  As a result, I've deleted my old reviews and pictures so that you all get a more updated review of this place.  

I will try to compare to the old restaurant and be a bit more detailed than usual.  

Price: The chirashi used to be $12.95 (non-lunch special, but is now $14.95.  Lunch specials are around the same price as before (some are $1 more expensive, some are $1 cheaper).  

Menu/combo variety:  They have a lot more bento boxes and sushi/maki combos than before.

Food quality and presentation: This is the area where they have vastly improved.  The chirashi bowl before was in a big red round container and was basically normal Chinese rice with LOTS AND LOTS of sashimi on top.  It was amazing value and decent quality but not well presented. In this new version of Nijo, the portion size is considerably less compared to the old standards, but is on par with other sushi places and the quality and presentation is much better.  Also, the rice tastes a lot better as it tastes properly vinegar-ed.  

Value: Unfortunately, the value here was previously insane and now it is just average value.  Nothing wrong with that.  

Service: A a bit better than before.  I ordered a 60 piece sushi platter at 11 am and they were able to prepare it by 11:30.  It was a last minute meeting.  I really appreciated that. 

TL;DR: Totally different restaurant, good tasting food presented well and better service than before, but slightly more expensive."}
{"text":"Honestly, my girlfriend was coming to this place for the past ten years. However, once they changed ownership couple of years ago. It all went down the drain. Food is horrible, service is next to zero. Every worker was seating around the the table and eating 3 hours before closing while we were waiting for someone to take our order. Once the server came, she had her mouth full while taking an order. Have been disappointed for the past 3 times hoping it would improve, but enough is enough. Don't go to this place."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 3.5.  I've had better places for Japanese/Korean food.  They are extremely nice and friendly there but I find their prices a bit steep.  Although I think their portions are more than decent.  I go here when I'm craving japanese/korean food when I'm at home because they are close by.  If I'm out and about, I would travel to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love the energy of the people that greet me when you come into the restaurant. The restaurant is a bit crowded during lunch time and you may only find space in the bar. If you get there around 11:50 you should find a table for 2-4 easily. The food is really good and prices are fair."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot located in Greenwin Square.  Their prices are reasonable (rolls average $6.95 to $9.95 and sushi/sashimi are around $2.00 each).  The owners are very friendly and literally waved goodbye from across the restaurant as I left."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! 

I ordered salmon teriyaki with tempura but the food I got had NO tempura inside!!! They placed the wrong order for us and lied to me! The waitress was extremely rude and refuse to let me talk to the manager. \"We have no manager, what do you want?\" She said. Finally owner picked up the phone with no apologies and told us no time to cook tempera for us even though we wanna pay for the extra charge for tempura. 

I come to this sushi place at lease once a week and this is how they treat their old customers. Definitely don't want to come back again!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi place for lunch. The prices are pretty average and the food is decent. They serve both Korean and Japanese dishes there so I tend to order the bulgogi lunch special. I also recommend trying out the chirashi but don't eat there on Mondays or Tuesdays. They tend not to be as fresh (older fish left over from the weekend). I heard that they restock on food on Wednesdays or Thursdays but I can't be sure. 

The restaurant gets pretty packed around noon when everyone in the surrounding companies goes on a break during weekdays so if you can, avoid going between 12 and 1pm to dine in. The restaurant has very limited seating.

Overall, a decent place for lunch if you're craving on Japanese/Korean food."}
{"text":"Cute little hole in the wall place. Two entrances, one by a side street by an apartment building and the other side of the entrance in the mall.

They had lunch specials that are applicable on the weekend, so we ordered:
- chirashi
- salmon teriyaki
- kalbi
- chicken katsu
- dynamic / california roll

All was very good and very fresh! 

Definitely recommend it and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Nijo is a decent Japanese close to the DT office and is a great value to boot. 

The sushi rolls are huge and quite are pretty good and fresh.  I think their shrimp tempura roll is my favourite.

If you buy a large order - there are some freebies like edamame, which is actually pretty good too. 

I have never come here for a dining experience - but the take-out experience is pretty simple and a breeze and the staff was quite friendly and patient."}
{"text":"The place was nice, the portions are good but I've had better sushi"}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious sushi. Staff are very friendly ( although the management seems to have changed recently) lots of stuff to choose from, nice ambience. 
I always get takeout from here- very fast and  super tasty."}
{"text":"Such a delicious experience at Nijo Restaurant. Tried it for the first time when a friend came to visit and we had wandered over to that part of town. We ordered one of the sushi boats to share, and it did not disappoint. There was a huge selection of sushi and sashimi, and everything was so fresh. The sashimi in particular was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The price was very decent for such a large boat, and the waitress (a nice elderly lady) was very friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back in the future for more outstandingly yummy sashimi!"}
{"text":"An underrated sushi place in the Bloor east area. Thins have changed significantly since the new owners took over a while back. Excellent service, cozy accommodations and tasty sushi. Definitely a place to try again if your were deterred years before these owners."}
{"text":"I went there quite often because it is close to where I work, but my experience today is definitely a show stopper. My friend put the order of salmon teriyaki with tempura but they actually gave us salmon teriyaki. In my opinion it is acceptable to have some miscommunications in telephone order but what makes me put one star review now is because of how they react to the complaint. They said \"we don't have the time to cook your tempura even you are willing to pay for the difference\". Look how big portion I got for $12.25?"}
{"text":"Lunch specials all day! Very reasonable prices, and if you pay cash, you get 10% off! Their sushi and sashimi combos are good quality for the price, and it also includes a salad and miso soup! This is my go-to when I want some good sushi for a cheap price!"}
{"text":"It's not too shabby for a small secluded Japanese restaurant owned by Koreans. The menu offers a mic of Japanese and Korean style basic food.. 
Means the bento box, sushi, sashimi, spicy chicken, bulgogi

One of the most try if you're a sashimi fan is chirashi which is sashimi on a bed of rice. They have the lunch portion which is smaller than the dinner portion. Like how they have this, offers a size variation which is awesome.

Price wise is somewhat reasonable for a downtown sushi place offering decent sized portion.

Location, just right of the Sherbourne subway. Beware as when lunch hour hits, excited longer line. Even weekday dinner time, it's continuously flowing with people."}
{"text":"The food was a pretty good value from the lunch menu - tasty selection and kept me full for the day.  What was lacking was the service; 6 of us had to argue with the waitress to get separate bills, because we were each going to pay with debit/credit.  The food also came to the table in a very staggered manner - half of us had to sit there with food in front of us, while we waited for the rest of the food to arrive."}
{"text":"Far from the best I've had, but consistent in the good quality and super friendly service. Working nearby makes this place a staple! Will be a fan indefinitely of the amazing Chirashi lunch special, which feeds me twice in the same day for $13 only!"}
{"text":"I had previously rated this restaurant as 5 stars as it was my go to Sushi place. They had generous portions and gave you the good stuff (Salmon/Tuna). The Chiraishi was absolutely amazing. 

Unfortunately, Nijo Sushi changed ownership in the Summer and the new restaurant is basically what you'd expect from any other sushi restaurant. There really is no value prop to make me come here anymore, in fact, I am so angry that my go to place has changed that I just won't go anymore. So less portions, no soup or salad or edamame and they increased prices... should be giving them 2 stars. 

I wish the new owners would have kept to the same working formula that the old owners used. Oh well, on the hunt for another sushi place."}
{"text":"After having lunch here I'm not sure why they don't have a higher star ranking. Don't let the exterior signage scare you off. The food was delicious, priced well, and in large portions. I had a lunch special and was surprised by the quality and portion size for about 10 dollars. The interior is cute as well. A great hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Ever since the ownership changed last year the portions have shrunk and the prices have increased! Disappointing and after half a dozen chances, I'm giving up! No more Nijo for me!"}
{"text":"They switched management about a year ago, but decent portions and a nice variety of Korean dishes (a very tasty bibimbap makes the Japanese/Korean hybrid menu somewhat forgiving).  It is located in sort of an odd spot but there are 4 or 5 different Japanese restaurants in the area and this is tops.  Lunch take out is relatively quick and the wait staff are very nice.  The salmon teriyaki is one of my favourites, and they serve it with glass noodles (most of the time)."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch and instead of my usual Chirashi Sushi, I ordered their Sashimi Bento.  That was a good choice.

They had large chunks of fish and I mean chunks.  Mind you it's not Gal's Sushi quality fish, but it's acceptable enough for the price you pay.

The salad was pretty good too and they start you out with some edamame.

Well worth it for a quick lunch or solo take out if you're in the area.  Takeout may be a better option as the place gets crowded and the responsiveness of the waiter staff diminishes accordingly."}
{"text":"Sushi is yummy.  Presentation is great.  I never knew we had a great sushi place here near my dingy sherbourne area. Had the red dragon and s11 combo. Warm geen yea.  Complementary miso is rich,yum!"}
