{"text":"Wow! This has to be Toronto's best kept secret!  The food has all the right combinations of crisp  and clear spices where East meets West.  Go before it gets known and crazy busy
We went at 8:30 at night and it was hopping busy. A great vibe and no attitude and the food is outstanding. The dishes were all outstanding and the service attentive. We ordered: Scallop puri, Ming bean Chaat salad ( crisp and fresh) ; the shrimp in coconut curry the Khao Shay beef . They had run out of the coconut Panna  Cotta so we settled for the Milk pastry and it was delicious. They have a limited wine selection but what they offer is all well thought out. The Lassie was outstanding.  Going back to try everything on that menu!"}
{"text":"Had a great time at Rickshaw Bar! I've never actually tasted food like this : A surprisingly pleasant taste of South Asia in unexpected dishes (try the Scallop Ceviche, you'll know what I mean). Do try the Paratha Taco as well: I tried the chicken one which I am a big fan of. Would go back just to have more of these.

The restaurant itself if very nicely done up- I like that it is spacious and am a big fan of the rustic piping that you can see everywhere (just look up).

They're currently in soft-launch mode which means that they are only open for dinner. Looking forward to this place being open later at night on the weekends - it should be an ideal place to grab drinks as well given that it is licensed and can hold large crowds.

Say hi to the chef, Noureen - she made the night for us!"}
{"text":"If you like south and east Asian food there may not be a better restaurant in the city for creative small plate street food. We started with the cardamom gin cocktail - great aroma and balanced flavor. If you like cardamom, don't pass this one up. 

The fish of the day was Salmon and the chili fish was spectacular. Well balanced dish with just the right amount of heat. Don't miss the beef or the chicken tacos, served on small paranthas. Both the flatbreads were lovely - the kebab is great for meatlovers, but my mouth still salivates for the eggplant one. Can't wait to go back and try the other things on the menu. 

The chef/owner came by and we had a great chat with her. A great personality and fun to talk to - we discussed cooking techniques and her inspiration for the menu. She (and the restaurant) will surely do well."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday dinner on a Tuesday night, and it was easily the best meal I had enjoyed in a very long time. Despite the restaurant having been open for barely two weeks, the food was incredible and executed perfectly. We started with an order of the Pakora Fritters. They were crispy, non-greasy, and very flavourful, accompanied by a delicious herby sauce. Next, we tried the Smoked Eggplant Flatbread, followed by the Khao Shay and Ismaili Beef Curry. Each order was outstanding, with a delicate balance of flavours and spices. The meat in our orders was tender and soft, falling apart beautifully. The service was very attentive and appreciative. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great experience - the flavours of the dishes were fabulous!  Started with mango salad - so many complementary flavours!  Also enjoyed fish and beef dish - yum. Service was great! Will definitely be a favourite destination of ours."}
{"text":"Everything tasted fantastic! We did a Chef's tasting menu for $45/pp and weren't sure what to expect. But every dish we had was delicious. I'm not a big fan of coconut, but the flavour was never overpowering. And each dish had a good balance of heat. The cocktails were good too. The chicken 685 was my favourite & a must-try. 

Service was great! The server also asked us which dishes on the menu we wanted to try most and he made sure that we got it. The only downside was that we were given 1 ice cream to share among 3 girls for dessert...A bigger portion or individual desserts, would have been better. 

Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Rickshaw Bar is the perfect place to meet a girlfriend for a few cocktails and a snack after some shopping on Queen West. The roasted cauliflower and smoked eggplant flatbread were my favourite, but I can't wait to go back and try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, full of flavor, great cocktails and amazing service.  Great to go with a group and share small plates.  Loved the Ismaili beef curry, roasted cauliflower particularly but everything was great!"}
{"text":"Good service. Pleasant friendly staff. Best thing on the menu is the beef kabob. Outstanding! Desserts were great too."}
{"text":"4/5! I highly recommend this place if you are into tapas. For starters, try aloo dumplings, chicken mango salad and naan kebob. As a main, you must have the chilli fish. We were not too impressed by the Ismaili beef curry and crispy puff dessert- but, that being said, a lot of people loved both so it definitely depends on your taste buds."}
{"text":"The service at rickshaw bar completely ruined our experience. We ordered one of each entree and the waiter forgot our order.

We asked multiple times whether our entrees were coming, to which we received the answer \"the curry is almost bubbling now, coming out soon\" each time. It wasn't until an hour afterwards, after multiple inquiries, that our order was actually placed.

The worst part was how they attempted to shift the blame on to us. I've never seen anyone attempt so hard to explain why a simple curry dish takes over an hour and half to arrive at the table.

The food was really good, which is why this place gets 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"Food was decent.  The portions are extremely small and pricey for what they were.  Food took a long time to come."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great atmosphere. The service is impeccable and the staff is very friendly. The chef came out and personally greeted us and asked us how we were liking the food. No complaints whatsoever. The Ismaili curry is definitely worth a try. Good luck to the chef and management!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while visiting from NY and had a spectacular meal!  We could not believe they had only been open for a few weeks!  The food was delicious and inventive.  The cauliflower and the Ismaili curry were to die for--subtle, delicious,perfectly cooked, and just the right amount of spice.  As good as anything I've had in NY or San Francisco.  Drinks were great too.  The ambiance was low key but cool. The service was attentive and friendly.  The chef even came out to make sure we had enjoyed out meal.  And the price was very reasonable.  Really hoping this place takes off.  The chef is very talented and the concept is great.  I will definitely be back next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"We took a gamble on Rickshaw Bar and we weren't disappointed. The food was very unique and tasty. Having been to numerous Indian restaurants, Rickshaw Bar provided a unique concoction of Indian cuisine, tapas, and fine dining. Albeit the menu may have been a limited and the portion sizes were small, it doesn't take away from the otherwise great experience we had. 

The best part was when the chef herself came out to personally greet us. She explained the ideology which was Rickshaw bar, her own history, and details of each menu on the item. I've never been so impressed by a chef. 

I definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday night with my husband to try Rickshaw Bar. The food, ambiance and service were all outstanding. The owner, Noureen, stopped by our table to tell us about each of the dishes we ordered. Her warm personality and very apparent genuine interest in providing a great dining experience got things off to a great start.

We started off with the pakora fritters (yum!!) and they were amazing! Ordered a second round of fritters because they were so good. We also had the beef curry which was excellent - the best we have ever tasted, hands down. The crispy milk pastry finished the night off on a sweet note. So, so good.

I will definitely be back to try more on the menu as everything sounded so good. I told a few friends about this place and they told me they were equally impressed."}
{"text":"What a disaster. 

First of all, they charge top-tier restaurant prices and their food is simply not good, either in terms of portion size or taste. For instance, the scallop appetizer I ordered cost $12. It had barely a single scallop shredded into small pieces. At Scaramouche, arguably the best continental restaurant in Toronto, a scallop appetizer cost $25. It has 3 whole scallops, with much better presentation, portion, and flavour. You do the math. I spent $60 and left hungry. The burger priest down the street was much more satisfying at $10. 

The service was up to par with the quality of the food in terms of incompetence. As soon as we ordered we were informed that the food would arrive at different times otherwise they would be cold. Are you kidding me. It is the kitchen's duty to time so the table's orders are complete at the same time. Do they only have a frying pan in the kitchen? One of our guests ordered the chili fish. As it arrived we were told that there may be small pieces of bone left in fillet. Are the kitchen staff really that incompetent that they are not confident to debone a fish? The ismaili beef curry I ordered was bland, did the chef taste it before sending it out? And for $18 it had only 3 small pieces of beef in it. It doesn't end there. They forgot two of our orders, 1 snack and 1 main dish. I tried to get our waiter's attention for 20 minutes. Nobody checked on us when they passed by, not a single server. The most important of all is that our server wore a pair of dirty sneakers. Seriously? At a supposedly 'high end' restaurant they try to be?

Never, ever going back."}
{"text":"How did I not know about this place? I joined a few friends who were well on their way through the second course by the time I got there. So I just tasted all their dishes and ordered drinks. The food was fabulous! The khao say and mutton curry were my faves. As were the cocktails. I loved the cardamom gin and saffron shots (with real saffron). I finished off with flaky pastry stuffed with sweetened condensed milk and some authentic chai. I'm already planning my next meal there.  

P.S. Don't forget to ask the story behind the wedding dress hanging at the entrance. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great flavors, friendly and fantastic service.  (Woman) Chef owned, which is awesome.  Duck confit bao"}
{"text":"Was here on Thursday. Very cute rustic ambiance
Food was not cheap but every dish was a work of art. Very tasty
Kudos to the chef"}
{"text":"This restaurant has, by far, some of the worst service staff I've ever experienced.

For all the good reviews this restaurant has for its food, it has exceptionally poor quality of service, which completely ruins the experience.

Firstly, our waiter forgot an entire order (we ordered one of every main). What was unbelievable was that we actually asked our waiter multiple times whether our entrees were coming, and he kept saying \"the curry just bubbled - it'll be out soon\". We found out later (during our first complaint, more than 30 minutes after we placed our initial order) that he never took down our mains orders at all. 

After finally taking our orders for the mains, the dishes took more than 40 minutes to arrive to our table, meaning that we sat there hungry and without food for over an hour.

When we complained about the service again, the waiter was extremely unapologetic, and very adamantly said that although service was \"slower than usual\", it is entirely normal for the dishes to take over 40 minutes from the point it was ordered to be delivered to your table. In fact, it was the first time in my life that a waiter tried to convince us that our party of people did not order entrees an hour into service, and tried to shift the blame onto us. 

As a tapas bar, the food was very delicious (which is why there are two stars), although the portions are very small for how much they cost. However, no matter how delicious the food was, it could not make up for the horrendous service, which I believe is a part of the experience, especially for the price you're paying for the food and the ambiance. If there were some way to award negative stars for service on yelp, it would score full points in that regard.

Little to say, no matter how delicious the dishes were, this abysmal service and the exchanges with the waiter destroyed the entire experience for us, and nothing will ever compel us to return to this restaurant again.

I truly feel awful for the business owner that she makes such wonderful food, yet employs such poor staff that provide terrible service, are poorly trained, and are a compelling reason never to frequent this establishment."}
{"text":"Incredible. I've been twice. I am HUGE fan. It's my Favorite place in Toronto at the moment. Order the Beef or the Coconut chicken. Actually order anything - you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Was there this past Saturday and it was great! The waiter gave is his suggestions and everything was delicious! The curry shrimp was especially tasty and their \"whiskey sour\" was so tasty we had two!
The service was a little slower than some restaurants but it allowed us to catch up and enjoy our drink. Our waiter seemed more than willing to go above and beyond to make us happy. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has been on my radar since it opened, but prior attempts to dine here were thwarted by various unforeseeable circumstances. I was finally able to make it on a few weeks ago - and it was so worth the wait.

We (party of four) ordered ten of the dishes (not including multiples of the ones that we knew would be popular amongst us). Almost everything we tried was fantastic. The standouts were the Ismaili beef curry, naan-kebab, cauliflower, and the crispy milk pastries. Other reviews have commented on the small portions, but it is meant to be small plates/tapas style. As mentioned earlier, we ordered 10 plates for 4 people, which was just the right amount of food.

The service was fantastic - attentive but not over bearing. They took the time to describe the dishes as they were brought to the table and our glasses were kept full the entire night. Chef and owner Noureen's dad also happened to be there that night, supporting his daughter, and he took the time to stop and talk to the guests at every table. He described her journey, having made stops at Momofuku, Origins, and Alinea (to name a few), and it was obvious that her dad was very proud of how hard she had worked to realize her dream. It was all very sweet.

All in all it was a fantastic dinner. I will definitely be coming back again and again =) And I hear they will start offering brunch soon!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were fortunate enough to experience the tasting menu paired with Sparkling white wine, and what an amazing experience it was! Each course was beautifully balanced with such depth that each bite was a new taste as you built off the last flavour. The staff are incredibly attentive and thoughtful, clearing each course at just the right time to keep the meal moving without any lag. 
The plating was beautiful with each dish lovingly assembled to highlight the strengths of the food and seemed to pull elements from the ingredients and from the countries/cultures that inspired the dishes. Without a doubt, this was one of the most relaxed, rewarding, and deliciously outstanding meals we have had. No hesitation recommending this gem to anyone!"}
{"text":"Went to Rickshaw Bar last night with a girlfriend and it was my first time there. I had heard about it from a friend from work and it did not disappoint. The waiter had recommended about 5 dishes for the 2 of us but not being large eaters we ordered 3, I would probably recommend 4 next time I went.  

To start we had the eggplant flat bread which was really good and had a nice spice to it. A nice start to the meal in my opinion. Following that we had the vegetable fritter tacos which were really good and one of my favorites in my opinion. The final dish we had was the Braised Beef Curry which was really good and had tons of different flavors. 

I liked how everything was small enough to share a bunch of dishes because when I go to a restaurant I always want to try everything. 

The chef (who's also the owner) came out to ask us how everything was and explain the stories behind some of the dishes, which was so nice! 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Worst experience. EVER. 

We were blatantly ignored for the first 10 minutes while we stood awkwardly in the middle of the restaurant's floor. When I asked the server behind the bar if we should seat ourselves her response was, \"I would prefer if you didn't.\" Following which she continued to ignore us. A group of three patrons asked what we were doing because we were hovering around their table making their meal uncomfortable, at which point the same server who I had spoken to came over to deliver some food to them, ignored us again and then went on to clear a table (of the wrong size for our group) rather than acknowledging us. 

There were 2 open tables at the back, which would have been large enough to accommodate our group of 3 - so having been repeatedly ignored and told not to seat ourselves we left. 

I will be sharing this horrific experience with all of my friends to ensure none of them eat there. Stay posted for the review of the restaurant we wound up at, which acknowledged us."}
{"text":"Great place! Went for my brothers b-day and we got the chefs special which are dishes that she chooses - although we let them know of some of our preferences on the menu.
At first we were worried that the portions were small but in the end with many small dishes we were satisfied. It was 4mths ago so I can t remember what we had...but no complaints.
Their drinks are also interesting, mine had gin infused with cardamom!"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday night for the first time and I can definitely say I'm a fan. When I first called to make reservations for six people, they originally only had a 9pm slot but was able to accommodate my party for an earlier time slot (already a great start in my books!). The menu had quite a selection but we decided to do the tasting menu for $45.

Food 4/5
The food is Indian-influenced and each of the dishes were jam-packed with flavours different than the one before it. Each dish left us looking forward to the next and we were not disappointed at all. There was a generous serving of each dish which left us full when we left at the end of the night. The tasting menu consisted of eight various dishes (dessert included) that ranged from meat to seafood to vegetables. 

Items that were served:
+ Scallop Ceviche
Very acidic but the flavours were well balanced and the juices helped cut the grease from the taro chips served with it. The slices of scallops were a little thin in my opinion but still tasted fresh.
+ Mung Bean Chaat Salad
It wasn't my favourite of the night but perhaps it's me and my dislike for cilantro. There was some crunchy ingredient in it that added texture to the salad and counteracted the texture of the mung beans.
+ Naan with curry-type dip
This dish was to-die for and was full of flavour. Served alongside warm naan (always a plus in my books) that was clearly heated on the grill that added a subtle charred flavour.
+Fried chicken
I thought this dish would be very underwhelming but was surprisingly very good. The fried chicken thighs were crispy on the outside, moist and juicy on the inside but got a little greasy near the end.
+Whole Thai fish
A little hard to eat in my opinion considering you had to work for your food and pick out the bones. 
+Indonesian lamb shank
Tasted gamey and had a strong flavour that I don't particularly enjoy. However the meat was tender and came with a side of naan with dips to cleanse the palette.
+Spicy Thai basil duck
The duck was very tender but was a little salty on its own. It came with a side of rice to help tone down the sodium levels.
+Beef curry
+Crispy milk pastry

Service 4/5
As I already mentioned I was already impressed that they had accommodated my reservation at an earlier time. We were originally supposed to get another dessert but they were nice enough to change it to the crispy milk pastry we wanted to try. The servers were all extremely attentive and took the time and effort to explain each dish. They always had a smile on their face and even though we overstayed the time limit they were polite when advising us. All in all it was a great experience and was also reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Omg, this is probably my new favourite resto!! Ate here twice now and both times were wonderful. The people working here are so nice. The Chef even came out to introduce herself and get our feedback on the food during our second visit. Which, by the way, was for my mom's birthday dinner. A great place for a casual yet intimate meal as the atmosphere is cozy but not at all pretentious. 

One really really important thing to note - DO NOT have the crispy milk pastry before the coconut pan a cotta if you get both for dessert. My dad made this mistake and as a result found the panna cotta sour and unsavoury. Whereas, the rest of us did the opposite and found it light, slightly tart and just the right amount of sweetness. Below are all the items we tried each visit.

Visit #1 (Didn't take pics this time)
Sesame Brussels Sprouts - the red cabbage was a nice surprise
Mung Bean Chaat Salad - didn't think we were gonna like it but ended up being one of our favs
Flatbread with lamb - tasty
Chili-fish - a nice light dish
Ismaili beef curry - I literally licked the plate clean
Crispy milk pastry - sooo yum!
Chai - good on a cold day

Visit#2
Salmon puri - good but wished there was a little more salmon in it
Roasted cauliflower 
Smoked eggplant flatbread - really enjoyed how the bread was slightly crunchy on the outside yet soft in the middle
Fried chicken - skin on this was amazing! Love the spices in it
Spiced coconut chicken - sauce on this was perfectly balanced 
Mutton rendang 
Crispy Milk Pastry
Coconut panna cotta - eat this first for dessert!"}
{"text":"Great vibe. Amazing food.  The portions like most comments are small however between 2 of us we had 2 starters and 2 plates and that was enough food.  We had the Greek wine which was pretty good.  Starters: cauliflower the marinate was tasty but the cauliflower itself was tad underdone for me, I personally like my cauliflower a little soft.  The naan kabab were amazing.  Chicken coconut curry was may favourite absolutely delicious.  Shrimp makai curry was pretty flavourful as well.  The crispy milk pastry was just perfect ending to a great meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by after dinner because the name just stood out and we had to check it out! The first thing that really stood out was the decor, incredibly tasteful and modern, yet the beautiful Ghaghra hanging on the right wall added the right touch of Indian! 

We ordered the Beef Tacos, and by the second bite, we had taste 3 different layers of flavours! A must order! We also tried the Eggplant flat bread which was an excellent twist on a vegetarian naan bread pizza! The sweetest part of the night was the Crispy Milk Pastry! It was the right amount of sweetness and saltiness. 

Toronto is flooded with Indian food, but Rickshaw Bar has set the bar really high! This city is finally opened its doors to some unbelievable food! Glad we got to experience it!"}
{"text":"This food is really good. This is a good choice if you like strong flavors, and appreciate spice of all kinds!!"}
{"text":"This review is for the soft opening of this spot. I will try and update the review once I have had a chance to revisit. 
This was a planned visit so I have had a chance to study the menu beforehand.
First off the ambiance, the place has a nice clean open feel. Plenty of seating at the bar as well and I can see that being a popular spot for late night drinks and munching.
We were a group of 4 so ordered a bunch of items
Pakoras. Decent and were nice and hot when served. The chutney on the side was OK as well.
Cauliflower. I did try this dish though not fan of cauliflower I found it to be spiced well.
Chicken Tacos. Prathas were used as taco shells (clever twist on this crowd pleaser) Chicken was OK.
Flat bread. A small portion and again spiced well.
Ismali Curry. Top notch. Complex flavors and thankfully the spices and heat were not held back. I haven't had this curry before but beef rendang would be a close comparison. Beef was cooked just right and falling apart.
Makai Curry. A vegetarian curry. Hmm one doesn't get to see this often. It was popular with other diners and they even ended up ordering a second helping. I tried it as well and again kudos on not holding back the spices and heat. Nice and flavorful.  
Crispy milk pastry. Hmm this one was not to my liking as the fried pastry overwhelmed all the other ingredients IMO.
The portions are tapas size so I would recommend 3 dishes per person if you are ordering the curry (comes with a bowl of rice) 
The cocktail list is interesting and worth a look. I had to order a delerium tremens once I saw it on the menu. Red wine was limited though from what I was told they will be expanding it once their supplies are good.
4 stars and I will be back."}
{"text":"I have walked by this space for years and watched it pass through so many hands. I have to say, I truly believe this space is now in the right hands with Rickshaw.

We went there last night for some pre drink cocktails and ended up trying some of the food.

Drinks aside (had a decently priced glass of vino), the food at Rickshaw is outstanding.

We tried the Califlower (which I cannot get out of my mind), the fritters, the dumplings and the beef tacos. All were very flavour forward and all deserve an encore. I have every intention of repeating this meal over and over again. 

Everyone who works at Rickshaw are very welcoming and friendly and incredibly helpful in picking items off the menu.

For a space that just opened a month ago, I have high hopes for it"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, great presentation, friendly staff. Prices are low enough that you can try a few items without breaking the bank. Also had very nice drinks. 

Beef was so soft that if you even looked it would fall apart into a pile of juicy deliciousness. 

Give this new place a shot you will be glad you did.

Side Note to Hipsters: 
Do not be alarmed by the fact that this place may not have a 2 hour wait list. I know how desperately you want to tell your friends and colleagues how you went for dinner at the hottest place in town. But here's your chance to try a great place and say \"I went there BEFORE it was the spot\". We all know how much you like to brag about that, so here is that opportunity. Your welcome.

Chris"}
{"text":"Really, I want to give 3.5 but limitations will not allow me to. Made a reservation for 3 Saturday night with my girlfriends to check out this spot. Very modern inside, with limited seating, so definitely make a reservation. There was a beautiful lengha hanging, and the host told us that the chef was supposed to get married in that outfit, but left to pursue a career as a chef. 

We started off with cocktails, and I chose the whiskey tamarind. This was very refreshing, and garnished with ginger, which gave it a nice kick. The other drinks my friends had were OK but, the whiskey tamarind was a winner. 

For snacks, we had the naan kebab, pakora frites, roasted cauliflower, and a beef paratha taco. The mains were the shrimp, ismaili beef curry, and lamb. The pakora frites were mostly just tasting fried batter, which was disappointing. The taco was loaded with beef, but wasn't anything exciting. I loved the naan kebab and the cauliflower. Both flavoured so well, but not overly spicy. I really enjoyed my ismaili beef curry, especially the richness of the peanut flavoured broth. However the basmati rice we got on the side was hard,  which did not make it enjoyable. The lamb was also very delicious and cooked to perfection. 

The service was very slow, which made it a bit frustrating. The food just took too long to come out. The price is pretty much standard for queen west, and between the three of us it was 47 each, with tip. I'd like to come back and try their khao shay!"}
{"text":"One of the most talented young chefs I've seen in a long time runs this place with her boyfriend taking care of the drinks. 

The menu is simple yet packs a punch and has one of the best Indian fusion cuisines I've come across at a reasonable price point without the usual pretensions of places like Morad of San Francisco. 

Try ordering 2 to 3 dishes per person and share. I can not recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"The only reason that I wouldn't give 5 stars would be for the very small portions. However, the quality of almost everything was wonderful. The menu recommends that you order 4 snacks and 2 mains. I could have swam in a bucket of the gorgeous Ismali Beef Curry.

This dish is beyond the scope of any curry you've had in Toronto, and like nothing that you will have anywhere. The chef explained that it's her great grandmother's recipe and very special to her. If I had a family recipe like this, I'd be just as proud. It's a silky mixture of peanut, coconut... and EGADS...what else is in there??? The server said there were over 27?? ingredients and it takes a week to make. This spicy, harmonious curry clung to the sous vide beef and soft potatoes like a velvet glove. This dish was probably one of the best things I've eaten in my life.

The Kho Say was delicious, too. Crunchy noodles, soft noodles, a light creeping spice and a fabulous coconut broth.

Chicken paratha tacos were amazingly delicious, and full of flavour. Really liked the paratha shell, too.

Cauliflower was a wonderful side with our curries and a must have with any of the dishes.

The ceviche was okay. I found the portion to be a little smaller than almost everything else we ate and the fish felt a little buried under the rice puffs.

Milk pastry was out of this world! 

Bottles of wine are the way to go as the pours by the glass are only about 4 oz. Bottles are all below $40 and chosen to highlight the depth of flavours in the food. Not always easy to pair, but they've made some good choices.

I love that we live so close to this place and I'm already planning to return next Friday with some friends. Rickshaw bar is a favourite new place!"}
{"text":"Ate at the Rickshaw Bar last night and it was a fantastic experience. I went in with fairly high expectations based on reviews and it lived up to those and more. All the food was spot on and had the perfect amount of kick to the dishes with some spice.

If I went again, I would love to try some other items but very tempted to stick with the dishes I had knowing how top notch they were. If you go, you definitely need to try the brussel sprouts, cauliflower, naan kebab (clearly the highlight), ismaili beef curry and spiced coconut chicken. That was a lot of food for two people but it would be hard to cut any of those items out they were so good."}
{"text":"Positive: friendly staff, decent flavor overall (Avoid the deep fired chicken though)
Negative: extremely small portion, and perfect for someone with an eating disorder."}
{"text":"I know it is a tapas style place with small portion style food, but it did not reflect the quality for the price.  After visiting Rickshaw Bar we did end up going to another place to get food.  I will add some pictures of few dishes and add extra comments there.  The service was pretty good and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I re-visited this small restaurant after a year and the quality of the food and service are still first class. Each dish has it own carefully crafted distinct flavours and all are worth trying. On this occasion we had the Brussel sprouts - who would have thought they could be so interesting and tasty, the chicken mango salad, like all the dishes small but worth it, the lamb beautifully grilled, the eggplant flatbread with its unique toppings, and a new desert not yet on the menu that was so inventive and delicious.
The South African sauvignon was better than expected and the house Burgundy fine.
The owner is still there, on the premises. 
Service very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The decor was nice and didn't feel like I needed to be careful with the furniture. The wait staff seemed a little inexperienced but did a good job. They took good care of us. It is tapas style so get ready to constantly be ordering. I'm not a fan of tapas style dining because I always leave hungry or paying way too much for ordering so many dishes to fill me up.

All the food is Indian flavour with different fusions. For example, soft taco shells with Indian filling. There were a lot of vegetarian options so my wife was into it. We tried basically everything in the menu and the food was good. Just a few things that got me annoyed. Since its tapas and sharing, there should be serving utensils. No knife at table, just spoon and fork. Getting a second glass of wine took way too long. We were there at 730pm and they ran out of the specially so quickly.

I probably won't come back on my own but would definitely recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"If I were rating the food only, it would be a solid 4-5 stars. However, because of the small portions, slow service and actually, the speed of our entire meal, I'd rate Rickshaw Bar 3 stars.

I made a reservation the night before for 6 pm. We were told that they had another party coming in at 7:45 pm, which was fine. The hostess assured me that we would not be rushed and the kitchen would know that we would need to finish by 7:45 pm. However, the food came out very slowly and nearly one by one after we ordered.

The Salmon Puri dish came out first. Four crispy shells filled with a sour salmon tartare. I liked the differences in texture. A small portion, a bite per person.

Next, we had the Naan kebab. This was like a tasty lamb pizza, topped with some yogurt and jalapeno for spice. My aunt found this a bit salty but I thought it was quite delicious.

The two curry dishes came out at the same time: coconut chicken curry, and ismaili beef. These curries were both amazing. They were very fragrant and creamy, and just spicy enough. I wanted to drink the sauce. However, again, portions for price were tiny as we had about 1 piece of meat per person (4-5 pieces per dish) and just enough sauce for the bowl of rice we were given.

Finally, we got our last dish, the Khao Shay. This was also very tasty. The noodles were fresh and soaked up the amazing curry soup. But again, they gave us a small pile of noodles and about 5 pieces of meat.

Our waiter was nice enough to acknowledge the kitchen speed, and declared that our dessert would be on the house. We ordered the coconut panna cotta, and the fried milk pastry. Not surprisingly this took a good 15 minutes to be brought out. But I must say, the coconut panna cotta was amazing. It had a great pudding texture, a super coconut milky taste, and it was dense. The fried milk pastry was alright, I can't say that I tasted much milk though!

Although the food was superb, due to the price point vs portion size, slow kitchen, and slow service (we had to ask for our water glasses to be filled twice), I will probably not be back. This is really too bad because the food is actually quite delicious."}
{"text":"Once in a while one could be misled by my favorite reviewer Chris Nuttall-Smith. This was one of those times.

My wife and I went to Rickshaw Bar, after reading the review published last November. And remembered favorably even at today's Globe and Mail with these words, \"Rickshaw Bar, at Queen and Bathurst, where the East African-Pakistani-Southeast Asian cooking, from a talented, young, female Pakistani-Canadian first-time chef and restaurateur, is some of the more exciting food I've tried.\"

We diligently made the reservation and arrived on time. And it was good that we did, otherwise we would have faced the same fate that a very decent group of guests faced (more on this later).The server sat my wife while I was parking my car. It took at least 15 minutes before we could receive a menu or asked if we wanted a drink. 

Ordered Scallop Puri, and MUNG BEAN CHAAT SALAD as starter and Lychee Lassi and Perrier for drinks. For our \"plates\" we ordered ISMAILI BEEF CURRY, and CHILI-FISH.

Lychee Lassi with a decent taste came in a very small mug full of ice with very little actual drink. Server forgot the Perrier, and after a reminder brought San Pellegrino (never explained that this is the sparkling water they serve and not what we asked). 

Our first starter was served impolitely by another server who poured some chutney style sauce from a very tiny cup and briskly took the cup away without even explaining as to what it was, and if we wanted to add a little more. Those who know Gol Gappa or Pani Puri should visualize scallops in the Gol Guppa instead of traditional chickpeas and potatoes. When we asked our server as to why the tiny cup of chutney was removed, he advised us that they had only one such cup in the restaurant and it could not be left on the table.

While we were trying the taste of Scallop Puri , a trio of very decent and  stylish folks (two women, and a man), was seated next to us. 

The way they were treated by a server (not the one serving us), I got a hunch that something wrong was going to happen. Upon being asked for the menu  by them,the server came back and very insolently asked if they had a reservation (mind you that no one could get in without a reservation, and these people were seated by the same server). After a while the owner (Ms. Feerasta) came and very openly confronted these guests that they did not have a reservation and would have to leave. The argument lasted for a while and spoiled our appetite. And those very graceful people left in disgust. (The owner should have recognized that someone at her establishment made an error, and should have somehow accommodated). This is the least one expects from an owner who has been praised by none other than Chris Nuttall-Smith, and who has served at Momofuku. 

After this I sought the attention of the owner and asked about the chutney cup, and she said that she is the Chef and this is how she wants the customers to taste what she has offered (good enough if one is the Chef at Boloud, or Buca, or Shotto, not at a dining joint naming itself after Rickshaw, the poor folks ride in South Asia). I advised her that we respected her privilege but as a customer have the right to mess up our taste. By the way we ordered another Scallop Puri since the serving was whimsically small even by small plates or tapa standard (the chef may want to take a tour of Ossington and observer how small plates are served there, or may be at Cava, that is not that far away). She may also note that even if she is improvising on traditional Pani Puri or Gol Guppa, the tradition requires an offering of chutney on the side even if as fusion.

By this time our appetites were totally gone and we went through the motions of enjoying quietly. The Ismaili Curry was a play on traditional Aloo Gosht (Potato Meat Curry) in Indo Pak homes. Again a very small serving (it was supposed to be a plate or dish!), with not even the distant taste of ingredients listed on the menu.

Similarly the Chili Fish was without any distinct taste. The Chef apparently failed if she tried to play upon similar dishes from places like Thailand.

Overall a disappointment. Those who know Indo Pak or South Asian taste would probably waste time and money because Chef's pun on tastes from those climes fails miserably. 

Others who do not know what tradition South Asian cuisine is, will not even know the difference, since for them \"Butter Chicken\" is what is fed to them at the places like Lahore Tikka, and that is all they know.

We went there only because Chris Nuttall-Smith suggested it, and will never go there again neither recommend it.  What a waste of time and money?

The only saving grace was our decent and polite server."}
{"text":"We walked into Rickshaw Bar by chance and sat down towards the back from the room.  We ordered the ceviche, all three tacos, the khao shay and the crispy milk pastry.  We were very impressed with the complex but complimenting flavours of the dishes, with the beef taco being my bf's favourite and the milk pastry being my favourite (the cardamom flavor really stood out). As another reviewer mentioned the portions are on the smaller side but we were not hungry after our meal, I think because the khao shay and the beef taco were actually pretty rich and filling.  We plan to go back another day to sample the rest of the menu.  

The ambience of the restaurant was nice and felt classy due to the minimalist style of the décor.  I think it would be a good place for a first or a casual date.  They also have a wine and cocktails menu."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of pani puris. My dad will make them for me at home sometimes. Of course Rickshaw Bar doesn't serve you the kind of pani puri you would get on the streets of India. No, they bring you an elevated dish, which has salmon in the puri. It's quite light and enjoyable. Although a little on the expensive side, considering you only get 4 for $16.

We also had the Cassava Bravas (another app), and Spiced Coconut Chicken and the Ismaili Beef Curry for mains. The dishes were all presented well and tasted great. However, this place lost a star based on speed of service. I found them to be incredibly slow and they brought out the dishes in a weird order. Our second app came out after the mains. 

The food was delicious and the general ambiance of the place was spot on. The drinks were fairly spot on. Hopefully the slow service was just that day. Everyone has an off day. Overall we enjoyed our time here and the fact that we were accommodated on a busy and cold evening without a wait!"}
{"text":"I hate Yelp for all these reviews. \"Service was slow, I'm south Asian and it didn't feel like home food, the napkins were wrinkled, the dress hanging on the wall is not gucci\" god damn it.

This by far the best food I've ever tasted in Toronto. Period. 
I've never tasted food before that I was clapping after every bite I had.
Yelpers are just bitchin and being judgmental because they have nothing else do.
I understand that sometimes a server will piss you off, the chef will miss your order etc. But that texture playground in your mouth on every single dish you won't experience again.
Most possibly I would rather enjoy a double bacon cheeseburger or a steak in any other place but moaning and clapping when eating food never happened to me before.
This place should be the talk of the town heads down.
Respect to the chef and the staff.
Spectacular.
If anyone has the slightest knowledge about food and ingredients should go and eat there."}
{"text":"The owner came up to us after our meal to ask how we liked it- we told her it was delicious because it was! Chicken 685 and mung bean chaat was to die for!"}
{"text":"A friend highly recommended Rickshaw bar and I decided to give it a try via Uber Eats.  The mango salad did not have a ton of mango (mixed with cucumber and red cabbage) but was nonetheless excellent: very well flavoured.  The Ismaili beef curry is very similar to the Masaman curry offered at Thai restaurants.  The Ismaili beef curry is well crafted but I still prefer Pai's Masaman curry.  Not to say that this one is not good - just personal preference.  Rapid delivery, adorable packaging."}
{"text":"Amazing! We had the $45 tasting menu. One of us needed gluten and dairy free dishes and they accommodated no problem. Every single dish was delicious. The flavours, the quality - exceptional. The service was fantastic and even the cocktails were an amazing blend of flavours. Highly recommend this great find!"}
{"text":"The Rickshaw Bar is a well curated restaurant that serves South Asian fusion style food. The place is very chic and great for various occasions; including get togethers, catching up with friends and dinnet dates. 

I went with a friend and we shared: 
Paratha tacos (incredible mix of styles. Easily our favourite and something we plan on going back for), pakora bravas, chana bateta, spiced coconut chicken (reminded me a bit of butter chicken) and the Burmese grilled chicken.

The food was solid overall, I also had the lychee lassi which was outstanding and well put together. The servers were all very attentive and pleasant. The timing of bringing the food out for consumption was one of the most impressive parts of the dining experience as well, just perfect timing that made the night run so smooth. 

Overall it was a good place to check out and a spot you can come back to again. I recommend ordering a bunch of plates and sharing them as the sizes for each dish vary a bit."}
{"text":"Thanks to Elvis A. for organizing a UYE to Rickshaw Bar. It was a nice mid-week pick me up and was thoroughly enjoyed. Right at Queen and Bathurst, the restaurant is non-assuming; I did walk by it once and missed it. The decor is minimal, but I can't say the same for the food. Rickshaw's kitchen is an open concept so you can see your food being prepared with tlc. To start, I ordered the chicken taco; the lime and jalapenos definitely were working. I enjoyed the kick to it. As a main, I had the Ismaili Beef Curry - another winner. Like the taco, it's also quite spicy. The curry comes with a bowl of basmati rice as well. 

Good for: Indian"}
{"text":"We were wandering around queen st, famished, and stumbled into this place as a 'last resort' (hadn't heard of it before, didn't look compelling from outside, not many people inside whereas all other places were packed, etc).  We were absolutely surprised and delighted by the service, atmosphere, and food.  We have since returned many times and it's a stunner every time.  I have tried most of the dishes and can't narrow down a favorite.  The chef is so talented and came out to ask us how we liked everything, and added many personalized touches- I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Everything is spicy so not recommended if you are not into spicy foods/curry/coconut...

My two friends who are into spicy food find the place soso.

1. The lamb dish was good (recommended)
2. The Coconut shrimp dish AVOID at all cost.  The spicy over power  the delicate taste of the shrimp and corn flavor, you only taste the spice.  

My dish (order mild) taste better than the regular version.  Still spicy......  Their  definition of MILD is still spicy...

3.  Pricing for a soda $3 for half a cup portion+lots of ice is a bit much

4. Warning - one of my friends had a bad re-action to the cleaning agent used on the table.  So if you have sensitive skin avoid this place or wear full body armor suit.


Service:
The guy was okay but it be nice if you serve cold water with ice during the summer."}
{"text":"Really impressed by this place. Really interesting combination of SE Asian flavours combined with interesting presentation. The service was great, too which is always a bonus. We tried the tasting menu and were completely stuffed by the end of the meal. Wasn't super expensive either. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If I want south  Asian tapas, this is definitely the place to go. Having said that, as a south Asian , I don't want my cuisine as tapas, so that was my struggle when I visited here.

The flavours were phenomenal, the duck (lollipop?) special especially good. 

Beef paratha tacos- ok
Naan kebab- absolutely nailed the flavours of Bihari Kebab. Really good
Falooda- I understand fusion, but this tasted- artificial. 

Pricey from my perspective , portions small- but then again that's a sober Pakistani who was expecting dinner, not snacks!"}
{"text":"First things first - I have to comment on the great atmosphere of this tiny little place on Queet Street. Dark, cozy, with smart decoration choices. I think that a party of 18-20 were celebrating a birthday party when I went, so I'm guessing that the hosts are VERY accommodating (just as long as you give prior notice)

I shared the Ismaili Beef Curry with a friend and it was pretty good! Not too spicy and not too runny. I'll be sure to go next time with an empty stomach so that I can try out more of the dishes.

The real gem of the Rickshaw Bar was our amazing server. He legit had a smile on his face the entire time we were there and checked up on us regularly to make sure that everything was going perfectly. I didn't get his name, but shout out to you, dude. You were the clear highlight of our visit."}
{"text":"Amazing Food!! 

The owner was super accommodating to our last minute request. 

I would highly recommend this restaurant. 

Try the Ismaili Beef Curry and the Faloda for desert."}
{"text":"We walked in on off the street on a Friday night around 7:30 after not being able to get in to a place down the street. What a nice find! The food was delicious, although the staff was not the most helpful. The menu gave a suggestion of how much food to order per person, although the staff never gave any recommendations. Eating with a vegetarian friend was relatively easy here. We had the scallop ceviche, the eggplant flatbread, and the pakora fritters. The fritters looked so good the table next to us asked about them and ordered them as well. Everything was delicious and well seasoned. Nice cocktail, wine and beer selection. I ordered the Lahore Roses (vodka, soho, roses), and was informed that I was the first guest to try it as it had just been put on the menu that day - delicious! Informal, cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"In the busy part of town at Queen and Bathurst,  Rickshaw bar is a popular tapas restaurant that focuses on pan Asian flavors of India. Though small, the ambiance is relaxing with hints of Hindu/ Buddha Bar vibes, dim lights, chic industrial decor and candles everywhere. 
Service was excellent! their prices are reasonable and it's a place that has a menu full of interesting bites. 

For food we had:
**Tuna tartar puri 3.5/5, lack of tuna.
**Pakora frites 4.5/5 not oily, well presentable, perfect for sharing.
**Cassava bravas 4.5/5 
**Grilled cauliflower 4/5 simple but yet packed with buttery flavors.
**Khao shay 5/5 
**Chicken and beef tacos 5/5 was delicious but would have preferred if they incorporated a hint of Indian twist...perhaps butter chicken or tandoori flavoring....this was a deal breaker as this dish had a lot of potential....tacos seems more Mexican and lacked Rickshaw's emphasis. 

Food 4/5
Service 5/5
Ambiance 5/5
Cleanliness 5/5"}
{"text":"Dinner with another couple in this small wonderful restaurant.  We all had the chef's menu and paired with mixed drinks and some cru Beaujolais.  I can't begin to tell you how amazing this dinner was.  Each dish had distinctive flavors and wonderful spice evoking all senses. Started with a naan and spectacular dip, then moved to two salads, followed by chicken thighs (best dish of the night), lamb shank, beef and chicken curry, a fish dish, and ending with a wonderful Indian type tart.  Fantastic dinner - strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service!!
I went late on a Saturday night with some friends who were slightly inebriated which is not an easy thing to have in a restaurant. Not only was the food incredible, but there service was as well. I would highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to go to the Rickshaw Bar for awhile. So when my friend suggested to go there one Saturday, I was beyond excited. I went in excited and came out very disappointed. 
I know food is tapas style, but the portion size is so small. The curry was $17 and there was barely any meat. And i wouldn't have actually cared about the portion size, if the food tasted good. Food was bland with unnecessary garnish and cold. 
Also even though our waiter was nice, it took forever for our food to come out. I understand it was a Saturday night but there's should  not be any reason to wait an hour for appetizers. 
This is honestly one of worst restaurants I've ever been to. Please save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great time last night at Rickshaw! First and far most is the service. They were able to accommodate a reservation for 7 at prime time and our service there was exceptional!! 

Really - our server was so accommodating and    didn't rush us out etc.  

Food - I tried every vegetarian snack on menu. Standouts included:

Cauliflower - good coconut flavour 
Cassava bravas - why no one has called this out is beyond me - so much flavour!
Pakoras - I know right? Wasn't expecting to be blown away but I stole them away from everyone 
Brussel sprouts - on special , roasted with a tahini or sesame sauce of sorts but very tasty. 

Also had the fried milk dessert - was ok. flavours amazing but couldn't break it with my fork, expected it to be more light and flaky. 

overall great menu and flavour.  Yes these are tapas sized - so expect smaller portion sizes. But perfect for group sharing :)"}
{"text":"This place was a good mix of Asian and fusion with delicious food! Service was really friendly, but not overbearing. The strange thing is that they said make a reservation, but it wasn't super busy at all when we arrived at opening. 

The drinks were delicious, though definitely on the sweeter side. They're classic and tasty (though probably better enjoyed before or after, as opposed to with, food). 

The pratha tacos were AMAZING! I wish I could eat hundreds, the chicken and the beef are also different, which was a nice surprise. The pita pizzas were okay, but definitely could have been a pass if you're unsure about them. The curries were DELICIOUS! They were beautifully spiced and full of delicious ingredients. They come with a small bowl of rice, and are not the largest portions, so you can definitely order more than one. 

I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We ordered the whole menu so rest assured you can't go wrong. Everything is delicious! We loved the chef, she is very friendly, and clearly passionate about food. Also, even if you are full, don't skip dessert."}
{"text":"I checked out this place out recently - had a really great experience overall. The food was good, the service was excellent and very attentive. They were helpful and patient with all my questions, plus made some good suggestions when I asked for them. Fortunately, I made a reservation because there wasn't an empty seat in the house at the time - so book ahead of time if you plan to visit the Rickshaw Bar.

We ordered the following:

SCALLOP PURI [scallop tartare. spiced puffed rice. cucumber. chili oil. lime]
- The was the only item ordered that was not suggested by our server (I should have known better) - it was my least favourite dish, i found it a little bland

ISMAILI BEEF CURRY [peanuts. cashew nuts. curry leaves]
- My dinner companion was adverse to spicy food, so we ordered this on the mild side. I asked for hot chilies sauce on the side that bumped this up exponentially 

SPICED COCONUT CHICKEN [green peas. bok choy. curry leaves. cilantro]
- this was the best dish by far, it had some kick to it which i liked and very flavourful

All in all, I would definitely return to try the other dishes they offer..."}
{"text":"Found this little resto based on Joanne Kate's top 100 and it was really good. All the snacks, plates and dessert we had was really good. We had the lamb, roasted cauliflower, eggplant flat bread, the chilli fish and the falooda. This would be service was great as well. Look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Long waits. Was told to wait 20minutes and had to wait an hour. Very unattentive servers, asked for water and server responded yes and ignored us for 15minutes. Food very greasy. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"I went to give a try in Rickshaw based on reviews, and ordered Khao Shay and Spiced Coconut Chicken. they were tasted yummy with coconut flavour and south Asian spices, but personally I felt the chef added a little bit more salt in the Khao Shay (salt also gives special taste to it in a good way). when the waiter asked how much I like the food, I told him how I felt. surprisingly, he took the matter seriously, talked to the kitchen at once, and insisted to give our table a free dessert. I will say their service is SOO great! me and my friend have a really nice experience here:)"}
{"text":"**A serendipitous encounter during our short stay in Toronto, Rickshaw is a must :)

We happened upon this place when the original restaurant we wanted to eat at was full, with a 1.5hr wait. But what a pleasant surprise it was!

Sitting down to the mostly empty space we weren't sure what to expect. We were soon greeted by an energetic and very nice fellow eagerly awaiting our questions and order. There were four of us and we just couldn't decide so we ordered one of nearly everything on the menu. 

I could go through each dish, but plain and simple it was amazing. Seriously some of the best curry and South Asian dishes I've ever had. Each plate was a world of flavours that delighted our tastebuds. Amazing. 

My only criticism was the size of the dishes. Small plates indeed, but I think there could be room for change here, even a small (like teeny tiny) increase in size of dish would be all it would need. 

Highly recommend getting in here before it's too popular and busy."}
{"text":"The food is incredible. Absolutely incredible. But the service? I've only ever been served by two people here and I have never been more impressed by the knowledge and passion they have for what they do. It matches the Chef's! It's incredible! Must be an amazing place to work."}
{"text":"Food was quite yummy and unique! I didn't quite like their drinks though. Service was ok - could have been better."}
{"text":"A solid 3.5* for fusion East African cuisine.

There's not many East African restaurants in Toronto, and very few that offer a more elevated experience, and this is the only one i've ever been to that's been fusion.

A+ for creativity, A+ for flavours, but the price to quantity ratio needs to be looked at (B at best). I get it, rent in Toronto and all, but it just leaves your a little unsatisfied at the end."}
{"text":"This is one of the best spots for date night! The food is extraordinarily amazing and the staff is super friendly! My husband and I went there last Friday and (luckily for us) the chef introduced a new item to the menu - Sweet Paneer - and I must admit it was definitely the best paneer dish I have ever had in my entire life! The head chef personally came and asked us for the honest feedback and I feel I have to tell everyone here how amazing it really was - highly recommend it! The price is justified as well...must say - you gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"The Rickshaw bar is a small tapas style type of restaurant that serves food of pan-asian fusion style - but with a heavy Indian influence. The decor is dark, intimate, industrial yet chic.

I came here with 3 other friends and was advised that it would take 1 small and 1 big plate for each person to get full, which isn't too bad considering the prices are low (most starter dishes under $10, no mains over $20). It worked well for us since all the items on the menu sounded really interesting and yummy.

When the dishes came, a friend commented that they were a bit on the small side, and I tend to agree - each of us gets to have a bite or two of the items and that's about it. The dishes themselves tastes fantastic, so that kind of made up for the portion size.

We shared:
Roasted Caulifolower - nothing special, good if you want veggies
Sesame brussels sprouts - taste good
Chicken 685 - the breading is a bit on the thick side but good flavor. There are two thighs in total.
Lamb Mishkaki - comes with naan and I have to say that the mint chimmichurri was great with it.
Naan Kebab flatbread - it is kind of like a pizza, and the beef, jalenpeno and yogurt combination was really tasty. Everyone liked it.
Ismaili Beef curry - goes very nicely with accompanied rice. I wished there was more of it.
Shrimp Makai curry - the shrimp was very fresh and the dish tasted great.

We also ordered the Khao Shay but for some reason it was taking a long time to come and we thought they didn't put in it the system. We asked for the bill but the item was there. Our server offered to take it off the bill but when the bill came, so did the dish. He then turned reluctant to reverse the charges but ended up doing it after asking the manager. It was a bit awkward but we were glad they did the right thing, otherwise it would have have left a bad taste for us.

Overall, I think Rickshaw Bar has some really great things going for it. If they change up the menu every now and then, and perhaps offer bigger portion size options, I think this could become a regular place for me."}
{"text":"If you love flavour, you need to do yourself a favour and make a reservation here.  This place exceeded my expectations.  Not only was each dish of the chef menu was bold and exciting, the service matched and was incredibly fun and welcoming.  Best part about this whole experience... the price point.  This has to be one of the best value for a tasting menu I've tried in Toronto.  

Rickshaw is a sleek and modern Asian fusion restaurant on Queen St W.  Even in the early Saturday evening, there was definitely a lot tables being seated and I totally get why.  With Rick (I hope that's his name... maybe Eric?) being a gracious, personable, and funny host, he set the tone for everyone else.  The place is not romantic as the music does hit a louder tone than an intimate experience. I do have to appreciate that there is some spacing between seats.  They could have crammed in another table here and there but it would be really unpleasant... thank god they didnt do this.

As I mentioned, the service is very good and it just isn't one person.  I saw the bartender and another main service staff showing the same attention, care, and warmth as Rick.  I love how they bring the dish to your table and go into detail the ingredients or a great story about the background on the dish.  It brings us into the chef's kitchen without actually stepping into it.  It also gave me a lot more fun chances to talk about the food or Toronto.  Not once did they run over, plop down the dish, say \"enjoy\", and take off. Each time was always a thoughtful interaction. 

As for the food... only one way to go really.  Chef menu.  Yes it is small plates but you eat so well and especially for such a great value @ $45.  Trust... and you'll be in for a treat.  Also, the pacing was perfect.  Never did we ever felt rushed or looking around painfully for the next dish.  Just spot on for every dish.  I do call this Asian fusion but it borrows more from South Asian region than others.  

Chef menu (CM) #1 Grilled Pita and 'dip' - What a start... how can simple bread be that good?  It's cause of the tomato, chilli, tamarind, cashews, and peanuts in the dip.  It's so good you want to lick the plate.  The spiciness is just enough to wake up your senses.  5/5

CM #2 Mung Bean Chaat Salad - What a fun 'salad'. Forget dry leaves, this is a textural burst with crispy pieces of noodles and chick peas (probably so wrong) tied in with finely diced up tomatoes and onions.  A nice refreshing dish that is bright.  4.5/5

CM #3 Sesame brussels - So its not the prettiest dish but damn its good.  Super crispy sprouts are doused and coated in a rich savoury sauce of sesame and tahini.  I used to only like sprouts with bacon... now Im awake to this.  4.5/5

CM #4 Chicken 685 - Good god... this is chicken?  A play on words from Chicken 65 & 685 is their address.  Original recipe is 65 ingredients and the chef has included things that are bold, spicy, salty, sour, and the right amount of pungent from the gojuchang.  It's fried crisp but still moist and tender.  Then tossed in the most delicious sauce Ive tasted all year for chicken.  It won Toronto Drake Hotel's fried chicken competition and I can totally get behind it.  Very worthy of the title. 5+/5

CM #5 Ismaili Beef Curry - it was the mom of the Chef's recipe and handed down to produce this dish. Very homey and yet full flavoured with tender pieces of beef.  The nuttiness from the cashews and peanuts play off nicely from the curry flavour.  It's not strongly of cumin but rather a good balance.  4/5

CM #6 Spicy Thai Basil Duck - Another dish that is ugly delicious.  With sweet and savoury flavours in play, your tongue is left guessing what is next.  The duck is already rich and with the sweet kecap manis and spicy chillis, it just ties in very nice.  The duck is tender with each bite.  4.5/5

CM #7 Crispy milk pastry - A sweet bite and ending to the delicious meal.  This reminds me of a gourmet crossover version of a croissant and freshly made croissant.  Crispy layers are enveloped in a rich sweet milk and gently scented with roses and almonds.  It wasn't too big but I was so full that these small bites was the perfect finish.  4/5

I could not ask for a better flavour explosion from a tasting menu and at this price point, Im tempted to make another reservation now.  Service is spot on.  I left very full and thinking of another moment I can come back to try other dishes like the shrimp, thai fish, or pakoras.  Toronto... honestly, get your reservations and just enjoy every bite."}
{"text":"Came in to order the Crispy Milk Pastry to-go. The man and woman who were there were very friendly. Since we took it go and ran some errands before getting to it, the pastry wasn't crispy anymore (totes our fault). The milk sauce was so delicious and I can only imagine how awesome this would be when it was still crispy! Kinda pricey for the size but I definitely see the appeal. I thought it was a very romantic and tasty dessert since it has rose petals sprinkled on it.

I'll definitely be back to try some more things. Especially now that Rickshaw Bar is open for lunch!"}
{"text":"Update: The first time I visited was during its soft opening. I came back here a few weeks later and the food wasn't as good as when I had first went. I'd still recommend trying it because of its unique menu, but I probably wouldn't come back as it's quite expensive and the portions (being a tapas restaurant) is quite small."}
{"text":"I love Rickshaw Bar food concept: a fusion of street food from some of my favourite countries in South Asia: Burma, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, India and Pakistan. Food that is simple but has such interesting and robust flavour with spices and herbs.

Thanks to Elvis A inviting us to join him a few yelpers for a little tasting of what Richshaw Bar so I ended up able to sample quite a few of their dishes. Just like any downtown \"Tapas\" style restaurants, you paying quite a bit for really small quality of food. Food here is quite tasty but as a big eater you might need to have 3 app and 2 mains in order to be full.

Roasted Cauliflower ($7)
Scallop Ceviche ($12)
Pakora Fritters ($6)
Smoked Eggplant Flatbread ($9)
Paratha Tacos ($6)
Khao Shay ($13)
Chili-Fish (Trout)

Everything tasted rich and well flavoured. 

I don't mind coming back again for a pre or after dinner snack. The main Small plates is really really \"small\"."}
{"text":"First time at this unique little restaurant, and i really loved the concept they were going for. The theme is to focus on small dishes found in South and South East Asia. Gotta say their dishes have outstanding flavour - the Khao Shay had a delicious lime coconut broth and the noodles were so soft and tender! The whole dish along with the crispy strings went together perfectly. We also had the Ismaili Beef Curry which has a cool, deep nutty taste. I recommend getting rice since it can get pretty salty (but still so good). To tie it altogether, we had the Crispy Milk Pastry for dessert. The flavours are so strong because of the cardamom and I absolutely loved it. The only thing that threw me off was how spicy the mains were. I did find out at the end (from Noureen, the wonderful owner) that they could have tailored the spice more to my liking. 

Will definitely go back when I have the chance!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food! We tried the Chicken 685 which had a lovely Smokey flavour, the mung bean salad which was crunchy and sweet and spicy. We also had the Ismaili beef curry and the Chana Bataks which came with a super yummy naan!"}
{"text":"It was late and we were wandering with some friends from out of town looking for a late drink. We stumbled across this place on the 5th day of its soft opening.
The drinks were good and food was amazing. 

The chef herself was serving us as they were not completely staffed up and service was a little slow but will definately be coming back again."}
{"text":"I'm glad I stopped into Rickshaw for some nibbles. Ordered a few items and they were all good even if the beef curry was a little salty, but the sesame Brussels sprouts were incredible. A great combination of savoury, creamy and a little tartness from the pickled cabbage (I think). Worth the trip just for this dish!! I should've ordered more."}
{"text":"Great tasting food. Very authentic Ismaili cooking which is an evolution of Indo/African cooking.

I would say that the portion sizes were ridiculously small for the price and the restaurant is understaffed as it took 10/15 mins to get a drink"}
{"text":"I wanted to check out the Early Bird Coffee a little east of here but the place was closed so I was glad to stumble upon this restaurant. The menu choice was simple but it took a while for my friend and I to choice some dishes to try. We asked the bartender for some recommendations which we were glad for the help. The dishes were wonderful and flavourful. They were on the smaller size but the aroma and spices used in the dishes were worth it. We ordered the lamb mishkaki, sesame brussels sprouts, shrimp makai curry, coconut panna cotta, and crispy milk pastry. Honestly, I thought the desserts were ok. Skippable because you won't be missing anything. But the shrimp makai curry and brussels  sprouts a must try!"}
