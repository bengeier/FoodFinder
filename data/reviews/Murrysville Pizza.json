{"text":"Just realized this place delivers to downtown Export and could not be more thrilled! They have awesome pizza and they don't skimp on toppings or deliver cold in the center calzones like other more local venues. I've had their subs on multiple occasions as well, and they're always yummy, however I've had some that were amazing and some that weren't as remarkable (the cheese wasn't melted and the bread therefore wasn't crusty). Still, great prices, great food, always friendly, and they deliver to Export! They certainly earned my patronage!"}
{"text":"Ordered again this evening and once again another solid meal. Pizza is great and this time I ordered their homemade garlic dipping sauce. It was excellent. My son had a crispy chicken salad which was yummy also. Gant go wrong with this joint."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place. Love the white pizza.   Price is good  pick up or delivery available.  Always on time and friendly crew."}
