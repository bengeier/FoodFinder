{"text":"Wow!
That's what I have to say first off this is a hidden away Italian gem. This restaurant has a little seating area where you can enjoy the authentic Italian cuisine.
They even have take away pizza's u can order. Which I did after I sat for lunch. 
Many Italian places have products that don't have that homemade love, here they do AND you can even buy a them to take home like a jar of their wonderful tomato sauce. 

***** 5 meatballs *****

{"text":"Shared the cheese pizza, chicken cutlet sandwich and 2 veal cutlets a la carte with a bottle if mango nectar for about $20. One of the best pizza and veal cutlet I've had. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Always consistent food available here ... Traditional Italian staples like veal, pizza, pastas are very good. Really only one salad available ( basic iceberg with options like onions, feta, tomato, olives), with dressing a tad oily. Price for this side salad a tad steep. 
Excellent coffee."}
{"text":"I liked this place, I really did, but there was a few things that urked me. The chicken cutlet sandwich uses Sweet tomato sauce instead of the traditional san marzano style sauce, which really ruins the flavor of the cutlet, and they pour the sauce on instead of dunking it in sauce, which causes what I call, an improper sauce to cutlet ratio.

Its no california sandwiches, but its decent. This bakery doesnt even sell any baked goods, just deli meats, hot plate items and some bread all of which was sold out at 1pm on saturday.....go figure.

I'd skip this place and go to california sandwiches for food."}
{"text":"Pastries are fresh and delicious... although we did get one thing that had strange tasting cream in it... Really love the homey feel of the place and appreciate the authentic \"Italianness\" of it.  Bread was very fresh.  Only wish there was more selection of bread types - there were many types of rolls but all white bread type rolls...  wished there were whole grain and mixed grain options."}
{"text":"Everything is is pretty ok -  but the big star of this place is the Pizza. Very well made pizza, for me it's some of the closest I've had in the GTA to come to NY style Sicilian in terms of texture and flavor.

Pretty out of the way for me now, but if I was closer I would be a regular for sure!"}
{"text":"It's a bakery/pizzeria/restaurant all in one. It's surrounded by suburbia, but you get a warm, cozy vibe when you first walk in. I've been getting my lunch here since high school. The pizza here is incredible. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Veal & Chicken Parm North of Woodbridge!! You can also get fresh bread, pasta, pizza dough, and other ingredients.They also have a great 'made-to-order' menu. I am going to pickup my party size pizza now!"}
{"text":"Yesterday when i went there they ran out of pepperoni pizza so then the nice lady with brown hair offered me a meat lovers pizza slice for the same price i was so shocked because i thought i was going to have to just get cheese. I strongly recommend you go there because their pizza is amazing.

*The only that i would recommend them doing is leaving the pizza in the oven longer it was a little more on the cold side but i had a microwave  so it wasn't such a big deal."}
{"text":"As far as italian bakery's go .... Molisana does the trick.  From the veal/meatball sandwhich to their pizza. Everything is authentic and delicious. Oddly enough, The last thing I would buy there is the bread 

The have a banging deli section as well. Sh##. If I were you. I'd go right now still"}
{"text":"The best Italian hot table for lunch anywhere. Daily specials. At least 8 pizzas on the go by the slice. Cheap lunch for under $5 if you get a slice and a drink.

Fast counter staff make the line move quickly. Even if you walk in and think it will take too long, WAIT. It won't take long. And it is worth the wait. Eat in or take out. Friendly owners and staff. 

Veal sandwich is legendary. I often get the bread to take home and enjoy. The jars of tomato sauce are pricey but when you take them home and cover some pasta, you taste the quality. Someone's Nona took some time to jar them up.

Garden salad with chicken isn't a menu item and works out to be expensive but a great order and worth it. They would do well to add a soup or two over the winter months.

{"text":"This is the best little italian place in all of Mississauga, the place is clean, the food is amazing, the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I love love love this place.  Molisana's is a regular lunch spot at the office.  We make the weekly pilgrimage for their yummy and affordable italian food.  It is a hot table style of service.  Everything they offer in their menu is wonderful.  I am partial to the veal parmigiano and rice.  Try the pizza - it is also soo good.  Lunch is under $10!

You will be well feed and satisfied at Molisana's if you visit!"}
{"text":"This my friends is more than a Bakery...Its a mini restaurant!

I was getting a hair cut in the same plaza and I saw the sign. I went in and on the right they had all the bakery stuff like Italian bread & buns, croissant and custard tarts. Where as they also have a food area where they had pizzas, meatball and the list goes on...

You walk in a little more they have a seating area where you can enjoy the goodies and they have a Tv too. look on the left and Vola a deli section as well.

I bought some of they awesome buns, Croissant and custard tarts. The buns were nice as I enjoyed it with by making me a steak sandwich. The croissants were very good, they weren't full of air and you actually had some bread inside. The croissant was soft and tasted great! the custard tart were nice and fluffy on the out side and soft and sweet in the middle. Pricing wasnt bad either as I left with 6 Buns, 3 Croissants (I wanted more but all that was left!) and 3 custard tarts for $12!

The cashier was nice and friendly... I would surely come again!"}
{"text":"They have a hot table that you can pick up a quick lunch at, their veal on a bun is great and their salads aren't bad at all.  It's not fine dining but it's good, hearty meals."}
{"text":"So I am now a Newmarket-onian, for lack of a better term, and I just happen to live super close to this little piece of heaven. 

Right off of Yonge Street in the plaza with the Mandarin, this place is tucked away, but not hard to miss. A legit, Italian bakery that caters, serves food to order as well as full meals to take home. Full lasagnas ready for the family, and even sizes for singles like me. 
They serve fresh bread, pizza, Italian produce and desserts! Yes, heaven. 

And I must include that they have a sit in area. Lots of seats for those like me who order and want to scarf down their food right away! Talk about a torturous car ride home, why put yourself through that if you don't have too?

So for my first time at Molisana (yes, I have been multiple times in the 2 weeks I have lived here) myself and the BF ordered hot sandwiches. One chicken on a bun, served with fresh mozzarella and pasta sauce and the other meat ball on a bun, served the same as the chicken.  We split both sandwiches, half for half, to get best of both worlds.  

These sandwiches were so delicious and super messy. By the way, you know you've found a keeper when your Sig-Other continues to go out with you in public after watching you scarf down a messy meatball sub. Not attractive. Maybe not the best place for a first date. 

For all you Yelpers, you know I would never mislead you. Out of all the items I have tried at Molisana, I definitely suggest the meatball sandwich. It's amazing. You cannot go wrong with this piece of heaven. They make their own bread and the meatballs don't have any filler. It's legit!

As for my most recent visit, I stopped in for a slice of pizza. They have 10 kinds to choose from each day. I grabbed the ham and pineapple slice and last minute grabbed a small side of grilled veggies. I don't know what they put on these vegetables but for the first time I enjoyed them more than my pizza. That's a scary thought coming from my meatatarian mouth. 

I insist that you try Molisana. Especially on a Sunday after a good bender. Did I mention that meatball subs are the perfect cure to a hangover?  Works for me. 

Buon appetito. 

Tiff"}
{"text":"ordered veal sandwich,small chesse ravioli and a pop
not sure why it come out over 18 $  the ravioli was only 3.99
anyways the veal was good .my son liked it,but the ravioli was terrible
I've had better Chef Boyardee,it was dry,the cheese was cold and the tomato sauce
was like prego, terrible wont be going back"}
{"text":"I just got back from lunch there. The owners are very friendly and welcomed us warmly. They have a lot of regulars and I hadn't been here before. I have coworkers who go there every Friday. I finally went to see what the big deal was and now I can't wait to go back their for lunch.

There were too many good things on the menu so my coworker and I ordered the following between the two of us:

Chicken on a bun
Meatballs on a bun
Brocolli pizza (as recommended by a regular customer who was standing in line infront of us)

The pizza was divine! Nice and crispy but not dry and I would have never picked the broccoli myself but it was mmmmm mmmmmmm good.

I am sad to say I took one bite of the meat balls sandwich and hated it. The chicken sandwich with mushrooms and green peppers was so flavorful and  had just the right amount of everything!

We ordered so much we couldn't try any of the baked goods. I want to go back now!!"}
{"text":"I will certainly NOT be the one to break the local 5 star love for this place. Part of a small group of similarly named bakeries across the GTA, Molisana has all the key points of a traditional Italian Bakery nailed down, and they do it great!

Baked Goods - I was having a tough time finding Zeppole before the end of season, many places were either sold out OR not making it anymore. I called Molisana and they whipped up a half dozen special. I was thrilled with this extra effort AND with how delicious they were!

In addition, and as Stephanie S mentioned, they also have a full selection of Italian buns and various cakes and desserts

Grocery - Looking for Italian specific items? They've got them in spades, whether it be a certain brand of canned tomatoes from the 'old country' or a pack of Briscola playing cards, simply ask and ye shall receive.

Hot Table (Aka Tavola Calda) - Madonna Mia!!! So many delicious items on their lunch time hot table, including all the staples (meatballs, veal, soup, pasta, etc) but what really put them over the top IMO was the array of freshly made pizzas they had on hand. Each slice is thick with toppings and even when warmed up the dough has an almost sweet characteristic which takes me back to my childhood when the Nonni (Italian grandparents/uncles and aunts) would make the pizza - old school.

Best of all you don't need to eat and run, they've got ample seating here so you can enjoy you lunch, pastry, espresso, etc before you leave.

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly they have one of the best coffee beans in Sauga, I love their espresso and most of the time just stop by only for some sweet and amazing Espresso 

so far i have tried their Pizzas, meat balls, italian sausages, chicken strips and pasta 
all are pretty decent and good price as well

They make Gourmet pizzas so folks go nuts!"}
{"text":"Came in here for a quick lunch on my break and was pleasantly surprised at the great service and food quality. Everything was fresh and had a great selection! Lots of comfortable seating as well."}
{"text":"Our school always gets our catering done here. The pasta and Greek salad are always our favourites. We love that the owners are friendly even when it's busy. 

All the entrees  one with a freshly baked bun and the pasta is top notch. On a Friday when the weekend is approaching, it's the perfect carb treat! We also love the Greek salad that using a red wine vinaigrette. It's super light and not too oily either -- the dressing definitely adds a lot of flavour to the salad. 

The party size pizza feeds about 8 people if you grab some other food too then there's definitely lots to munch on. However if you're super hungry, 1 Party size pizza may not be enough for 8. Overall, I definitely recommend this place if you're around the Aurora/NEWMARKET area or if you need a catering place. Call In advance for large orders and you're good to go to pickup on your requested date."}
{"text":"I started going here because I lived on the same street. And I've been back many times in the past decade.

When you walk in you are greeted with lovely aromas and a friendly vibe in this family-run joint. The food is simple Italian food and is quite comforting. So go with an appetite.

I go for the pizza. I've never had pizza similar to what they serve here. It's a thick crust loaded with toppings. I usually choose a slice with traditional Italian deli meats. But even the most simple slice tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place when i was in high school. The only thing i can say is fantastic was the pizza, because that is all I ever have had. Its done by three little Italian ladies for unique pizza, love the doe."}
{"text":"Came here a few time for lunch. First time I tried the veal parm, which I wasn't a huge fan of, but went back to try other things. The hot bar food is fresh, and house made, and the portions are quite generous. They have daily specials too I think.

If you like thick, doughy pizza, you'll love their pizza! Usually not a fan of thick crust, but the dough is really quite good! The sauce has so much flavor, that you don't feel like you are just eating bread. 

I bought their pizza dough for home as well and that turned out quite well. Price wise, they are not bad at all. About $4 for a hearty slice. Highly recommended for quick and decently priced lunch. Oh and everyone is super nice!"}
{"text":"Saw this place driving by and stopped in for pizza and bread one morning.

Veggie and Hawaiian pizza were great. Fresh thick rustic crust. 

Portuguese rolls were fresh and crusty. 

I also tried their veal, meatballs and pasta - all were very tasty and rustic.

Price is very good value, too!

I was hoping for some fresh Portuguese tarts but they didn't have any that morning. Maybe next time..."}
{"text":"Very nice little bakery/deli out in the 'burbs. Meatballs as big as your fist (and more) will fill you up for a fair price. This is a great little lunch stop. Not a whole lot of seating but people are in and out quickly so it is a steady stream of turning tables."}
{"text":"Lasagna to go is always my excellent choice & their best take-out plate!
Remember to request chili green pepper on the side!!
Every time i am passing by around lunch time, I think of their delicious Lasagna.
very much recommended for a very reasonable price too!"}
{"text":"The food is still great, but I have to rate this place just ok to reflect the constant disappointment and non delivery of promises. This is the fourth time I came on a Friday, driving out of my way and taking a break from work to buy some of those codfish balls and empanadas for the work crew as I promised them I would. I show up today and they don't have it again. They keep telling me it's every Friday. I didn't even bother asking where they were this time because it's obvious that they don't have it and it's Friday. Fourth time."}
{"text":"Fantastic fresh foods and great service.
The owner makes the best sandwiches and doesn't cheap out on the ingredients."}
{"text":"Normally most hot plate Italian bakery spots always are a 4 plus star winner for me. I'm not sure what's up with this place but its kinda getting less good each time I go. Pasta is just moosh, not overly tasty, and kinda pricey, the meatballs were oddly thick and kinda bland. Meh, not too impressed."}
{"text":"A great place to get a big plate of Italian cuisine.  Served mostly from a hot table, there are a variety of options that make for great variety.  For a quick dinner, I had a veal with pasta, which had a large slice of veal on a plate of penne, a bunch of steamed veggies, smothered in maranara sauce.

All the food is hot and fresh, and overall great flavour.  If you are serious about Italian food, note that this is not a fine dining establishment, rather it is more like a cafeteria with a serving line.  As a result, my veal was not as tender, and the veggies were a bit bland compared to other table service \"made to order\" places I have tried.  But for a fast, big meal, this is ample an satisfying."}
{"text":"A pretty darn good Italian hot table. The sausage on a bun is particularly good but so is the lasagna and veal sandwich. Prices aren't bad but also not a bargain. Portions are average, could be a bit more generous."}
{"text":"If you're in the neighborhood, you must stop by Molisana Bakery. They have the absolute best cappucino and expressos in Brampton. They also have a great selection of smoked meats, cheeses, sandwiches,  italian breads, fresh baked pizzas, pastas, pastries, ice cream and beer! You're almost certain to be served by the friendly owner himself, Nadir or his lovely staff. They are wonderful people who provide exceptional customer service every time you go in which is rare to find nowadays."}
{"text":"You can't beat their meat

Top veal sandwich in the area, fantastic sauce, price of sandwich $7.50 for the veal includes free toppings (not incl cheese).  My fave is everything less the cheese, great hot peppers, lots of onions & mushrooms.

The service is efficient & polite and no one walks away hungry

Nice selection of pasta, dry & fresh, meats & sauces as well as breads 

I'm there at least once a month and when I say once a month I really mean at least twice. I go regularly enough that if I stopped then Visa might call me to see if I'm OK lol"}
{"text":"Oh Molisana Bakery.... I've been coming to this bakery for as long as I can remember. The Pizza is by far the best ever. The POTATO PIZZA is heavenly. Its a pizza consisting of roasted potatoes, roasted sweet peppers and onions.... I just can't get enough. I remember ordering whole potaoto pizza's when I was pregnant. haha... Being my mom is italian, this is the only place where I can eat most of their hot plate meals. It tastes like home.... the service is always warm and friendly. The baked goods and bread I would steer clear from... I've never  had a good experience with the sweets/muffins/croissants etc... always hard. 

P.S. they cater... so order up!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best bakery I have been to. Very friendly staff. Lots of vegetarian options. Their Pizza were awesome. Still have to try lots of other things at this place. Will definitely go again.  The prices were really reasonable.  Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Popped in during the lunch prep in the morning. Super homie feel with lots of pasta and homemade sauce to purchase.
No food ready however staff was super accommodating.
Made my brother and I deli sandwiches.
Lots of meat, made fresh with love!
Also purchased a hot antipasto called \"la bomba\" that I can't wait to try!"}
{"text":"Busy lunch spot in Newmarket and with good reason. Their sandwhiches are delicious! I had the meatball sandwhich the other day and it came with 3 huge beatmalls with cheese (add-on). It wasn't as hot as I like so I ended up heating it for a few seconds in the microwave and the cheese just melted. It was SOOO GOOD.

Today I had the veal on a bun. It was tasty but the veal was a bit hard so not good for eating in a sandwhich. Would probably be better if it was eaten with a knife and fork. Finished my lunch with a san pellagrino orange soda. Yummy! 

Their pizzas also look delicious, fresh and loaded with great topping combinations. And yes like others have mentioned, not much \"pastries\" here. They do have some bulk breads for you to buy but that's it."}
{"text":"The pizzas here are good and have a tasty, flaky crust. Portions are large and the pizza toppings are generous. There were plenty of pizzas to choose from.

The veal sandwich was a huge disappointment- bland and chewy. My biggest issue is the food being between room temperature to cold- taking 1 star off.

The bakery section looked empty and in need of refreshing, maybe I came at a time before they were replenishing? 

Would come back for the pizza."}
{"text":"Molisana bakery. Not too shabby. Came in here for a pastry and an espresso... Couldn't find the pastry but the espresso was decent. $2 per shot. It was long and hot and delicious. Did the trick. Probably won't be back to be honest. It's a bit out of the way for me and the parking lot is a little crazy, but the price is right and the flavour is on point. Just personal preferences. 

I did see they had a hot table which was happenin' during lunch hour. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I used to go here in high school like 14 years ago. I figured I'd go back to revisit some nostalgia, and to maybe confirm that I only liked it because I was a dumb high school kid and it was cheap. I was incredibly wrong. Their pizza is delicious!! I shot a movie a week later on location nearby, and got catering from them too. Their pasta is always quite good but I think their pizza is the star. And their prices are beyond reasonable."}
{"text":"The name of this place is deceiving as \"bakery\" is a small part of their business.  As you walk in, you see a menu for the hot table and their pizzas displayed behind the glass.  \"Bakery\" comprised of some buns, loaves of bread, and a table of tarts.  You can also buy fresh pizza dough, deli meats/cheese, and olives.

Not knowing how much a slice costs, we picked out 3 different kinds: 1 w/ roasted red pepper/deli meats, 1 potato, 1 veggie.  The lady behind the counter told us that she was making a fresh veggie pizza, so we waited for that.  After we ordered, our slices were put into the oven to warm them up and they were presented on a dish with cutlery.

The crust was quite different, it's more of a focaccia, fluffy, yet thickish bread as opposed to a thin crust.  So 1 slice, for me, was more than filling.  All pizzas were fresh and delicious tasting!

Once we went to the cash, we saw that each slice was $3, 3 bucks for a BIG, homemade slice of pizza.  (We promptly left 'cause we felt as though we robbed the place!)  Waaay better value and taste than that Pizza Pizza crap.  Definitely a hidden gem in North Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot to get what seems to be home cooked italian food. 

Wife and I came for Friday lunch and literally just beat the lunch crowd minutes ahead.  While ordering another customer asked to get her food reheated, I didn't think much of it at the time.  I ordered the veal sandwich with cheese and mushrooms. Not bad tasting but it was cold. Even if they microwaved that would of been better.   Same goes for the pepperoni slice and chicken parm my wife had. I really wish it was hot so I could give them a fair review but serving cold food is unacceptable. 

I did enjoy the tarts"}
{"text":"Not so much items to choose from when I got there. A lot of baskets but probably had 2-5 breads left which made me
question how long has it been there.... Not much of pastries too.

Egg tarts are typical. Not extraordinary. Fenneli (?) - italian biscuits? are okay-ish but some pieces in the pack that I bought were so toasted, that it tasted weird.

Might be back to try their hot food."}
{"text":"So I hve this little obsession with veal parmigiano sandwiches so when I heard about this family owned Italian spot I had to pop in.
 They have a very wide  customer base...alot of regulars , as they seemed to know the names of the employees which is a great sign.
I immediately started reading the menu when I walked in which isn't very extensive. Just the right amount of options. The lady that helped me was extremely patient w me and so nice.
I decided on a veal sandwich w cheese and mushrooms and a pizza slice.
The pizza slice was meat lovers they hve a spicy and non spicy option which is great because I cnt handle spice lol.
The slice was amazing,  soft buttery crust and perfect amount of toppings Only about 3.25$
Cheaper than big box stores and better taste
The veal wasn't as great for me. They don't warm it up for you, but I didn't ask wasn't expecting it to be cold. 
It was a bit chewy and did not taste fresh at all.
I've definitely had better. 
Could hve been an off day, so I will be visiting again.
But the portion size is massive."}
{"text":"I discovered this place from yelp and I'm glad I did.  Though this is called a bakery, I see this more of a nice local restaurant than an actual bakery.  It has a small part for bakery (just a table), deli (one refridgerated counter), a decent size area for sitting in, a cafe for real espresso, and a pretty big area for hot table and PIZZA!

I tried 3 items from here over 2 visits and this place will have me coming back for real Italian comfort foods.  I got a 'fresh from the oven' veggie slice pizza.  This is not your trendy Neopolitan style pizza that is all the rage in downtown TO.  This is the old school Sicilian fluffy substantial interior but crunchy exterior.  Great  flavourful crust and it's covered in fresh tasty toppings.  I haven't seen this many toppings in a long time.  My veggie pizza was loaded with mushrooms, peppers, broccoli, onions, and cheese.  It was so good.  I also had their basa filet on Friday and it was perfectly cooked.  Moist interior with a nice drizzle of olive oil on top and seasoned with herbs.  I got 2 sides with it and they were so big for the price!  I couldn't finish everything.  I got roasted vegetables and potatoes.  Potatoes had that great crispy crust with a tender insides and roasted vegetable had a phenomenal herb mixture on top.  

I also love the service.  This place is so personable even if you're new to it.  Happy, smiling, ready to serve, and ready to answer any questions.  I think this place is a requirement on everyone's list should they need a great simple and quick Italian meal.  For Italian hot table and simple comforting pizza, this is as good as it gets.  The food isn't fussy, elaborate, or life changing but the service pushes it from 4 star to a 5 star for me."}
{"text":"The low down:
A great place for a quick bite to eat! Great mom-and-pop shop ambiance. Busy and popular during lunch times!

Recommendations:
1) Veal parmesan -- the go-to (I got this for lunch!)
2) Meat Lover's panzarotti

Things I liked about the place:
A good clean, well-organized, and spacious atmosphere (seat approx. 20-30 people). Tasty and fresh food.

Things you may not have known:
They cater as well apparently!"}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior fool you! It looks a little older with very simplistic furniture, but the food quality was pretty good.
This place had great pizza, had it not been for the rock hard crust, and the breaded chicken I tried was A1.
The serving size was fairly large, enough to get me full enough to fit in desert afterwards.
Staff were friendly and helpful with all our questions, but there wasn't anything super special about this place."}
{"text":"Maybe the best coffee this side of Brampton, all other choices are blech chains [timmys, mcd's, etc] and sit down restaurants that overwhelmingly use pod machines or only serve [stale] drip coffee. Food is decent, menu is standard italiano fare but prices are reasonable. Owner and staff are friendly, great selection of packaged pasta and olives for sale, and the cannolis are delicious - great spot all around."}
{"text":"A great local joint that's super casual, with affordable, fast and tasty food.

Located in a residential area, they get a lunch crowd thanks to nearby high school.

They have fantastic pizza and pasta. Food is put out in hot plate fashion. So it's kind of like fast food.

Not too much seating - but most people do take out anyway.

Also a great place to pick up pizza dough, sauces, and other ingredients too if you love to cook and experiment at home!"}
{"text":"The pizza from these guys is fabulous.  So is much of their hot table.  However, any time that I have used them for catering, I've had to call them several times to ensure they had everything correct.   There were two occasions where they had no record whatsoever of an order from me.  Further to that, for two Christmas Eve's in a row items were made incorrectly; I ordered a seafood risotto and got a huge tray of complete MUSH for rice as they used regular long grain rice and over cooked it.  I couldn't serve it and ended up throwing it all out.  The second time was when I ordered chicken tenders to be made for the kids.  That typically involves breading and frying them.  We opened up a container and found chicken without any breading that appeared to have been pan fried but not sure.  Because of these repeated errors, we have flipped our Christmas Eve catering requests over to Solstice Restaurant.  Have had much better luck with them and they will deliver too!!!!"}
