{"text":"TERRIBLE!! DO NOT EAT HERE. I had the Szchechuan shrimp and shrimp fried rice. It was bland and not spicy whatsoever. The rice was bland as well. I'm not understanding how Chinese can be flavorless. 

I gave this place another chance I thought maybe it was the particular item I ordered. NO!! I ordered pepper steak I've never had an issue with pepper steak. In fact I do a good job. I never thought that pepper steak could go wrong. The meat was funky and tasted so NASTY! The peppers and onions tasted like water. This had no flavor whatsoever it's like it was just cooked in water and not seasoned. I didn't see any seasonings or taste any. It just didn't taste like steak or smell like steak. I had to throw it away.

I won't be returning and I will call them to let them know about it. WASTE OF MONEY!

{"text":"This place is awesome. 5.25 for the lunch special, with soup. The food is fresh and fast and the portions are just right!! Perfect!"}
{"text":"We love this pla?e. Hands down best Japanese in town! We always call order in and there speedy quick! The lady who answers the phone knows our order by heart!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this little spot, new to the area and wanting to find a good take-out place. However I was extremely disappointed with the food itself, I ordered hibachi chicken and the chicken was inedible, the closest thing I could compare the texture to is rubber. It was like they had just overheated left over chicken in the microwave then served it. No flavor in the chicken nor the rice. I wish I just would have made it at home and saved myself the $19."}
{"text":"Called at 8:35 to check hours and she said open til 9:30.
I drive up here, arrived at 8:50 to the door locked, no lights on
CLOSED
What ?!  Hours on window say 9:30"}
{"text":"Wonderfully fresh food that is tasty and well prepared.  If you eat in, they bring it to you and she has service with a smile.  I had the Sesame beef and it was to die for. My grandson kept eating off my plate after he ate all his egg rolls.  Family had different rices and they were great as well.  Ate there again and had Orange Chicken.  Was wonderful and I was mad I could not eat it all.  Great and pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken hibachi- so gross! I ended up feeding it to my dog- I'm convinced there's no way it was chicken unless is was canned chicken- was super rubbery and disgusting.  Will never go back even though the soup was alright."}
{"text":"Good inexpensive grab and go food.  We ate lunch at Big Wok - they need to serve on better plates - egg roll melted styrofoam plates and plastic ware was a bit weak.  Table very sticky. Hunan Beef and General Tsos Chicken was very good."}
{"text":"Big Yuck. I thought it couldn't get worse than the local Red Bowl. I was wrong. 

This is simply bad food. Not just bad Chinese food. Bad food. 

Never again."}
{"text":"We've been ordering from big wok for years. But we've noticed lately that the food is being overly breaded and in tiny pieces. For example the sesame chicken is nothing but over cooked breading with almost zero chicken. Same with sweet and sour chicken and spring rolls. Feeling jipped each time. Gonna have to find a different place now. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Decent chinese food while on your lunch hour. $5.15 lunch specials. Nothing to rave about, but a decent meal for a good price."}
{"text":"I've gotten several to go orders from here without any complaints! Easy to park! I can just run in and get my food and go! Staff is really friendly and helpful. Their lunch specials are awesome especially for $5.25. You get your entree, rice and choice of a egg roll, spring roll or soup! 
First time I went I got the mongolian beef for lunch. Beef was good and tender. Not too chewy. Had a good spice to it. I got a side of chili oil with it to make it spicy. Rice was good and egg roll was delicious! 
Second time I got lo mein noodles. I was surprised that it still came with a side of rice! I got the house special lo mein noodles.. It came with chicken, shrimp and pork. I love the smoky flavor to it and they gave a lot of noodles! The egg roll was also good and piping hot. 
This place is well worth the price! I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I gave 4 stars for the fast and courteous service . 

3stars for the food , I felt the portion size was good , the freshness of the veggies great, but the flavor was lacking a little. I will go back because I can't resist a well cooked chicken and broccoli, maybe it will be exceptional the next time. IF not , I'll still have some perfectly steamed broccoli florets lol."}
{"text":"I struggled between giving this place 4 or 5 stars. 5 stars simply because they were good, fast, courteous, and well priced. I landed here because it simply wasn't the best Chinese I ever had but it was  still good. I haven't tried everything on their menu but I'll definitely be back for more. I don't think you can go wrong with this for some quick family take out."}
{"text":"AMAZING food!! I'm from out of town and my aunt recommended this place and it was soooo good!! I will defiantly be coming back when I'm in town!!! They were fast and very polite over the phone. They even give us a treat which are these yummy sugar donuts!!"}
{"text":"This is the only place that I will order Chinese food. Their food always tastes, good, and the service is  polite. they are speedy with the takeout. As far as cleanliness it appears to always be very clean. I've been Chinese food from all around the Country, and their's is some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Seriously? 
I must have come on an off day.
Other reviews sing high praises of this place, I'm not getting it.
My food was bland like I had a head cold, no flavor at all. I was worried when my hot sour soup was nether hot or sour.
And how rude is it the owners children where playing in the dinning area? 
The counter person was very nice, that's about it."}
