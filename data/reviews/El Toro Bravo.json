{"text":"Solid mall Mexican: the combos you expect, nice hot chips, tasty salsa, as well as an array of grilled meats and seafood options and a small vegetarian menu.  A good option when you want something predictable. The staff are very quick, efficient, and friendly."}
{"text":"I've had several good experiences at El Toro Bravo. Service is quick and the wait staff is always friendly My go to dish is the chimichangas!! Also give the fajita quesadillas a try. Chips and salsa are always fresh! They also have great lunch specials. Definitely in the top tier of Mexican food places in Champaign."}
{"text":"This place has gone from 3 stars to 1/2 stars in my opinion. When they first opened it was a great spot for lunch or dinner. My lady 3 visits have been bad to worse. Good is cold, oh yeah it can be heated again. However heating lettuce is never good. Cheese is watered down to just a sauce.  Try somewhere else!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I am disappointed. Today, I placed an order at noon for 430 pick up. I got here at 430 and waited for 20minutes, because they didn't have my order ready. This is the second time I've placed a to go order and had to wait over 15 minutes. Poor service and sub par food has cost them a costumer! I'll never be back!"}
{"text":"Stake taco are amazing. I just hate when I order my food over the phone and when I come get it nobody is at the desk. I'm always waiting 5+ mins. Other then that great"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan. It's typical Mexican fare, to be sure, but always fresh and delivered to the table quickly. I like the flautas, tacos, and fajita taco salads. Margaritas are usually v delicious. Always refreshing the complimentary chips & salsa."}
{"text":"We have eaten at El Toro's several times and always been very satisfied with the food and service. They are slower getting the orders out but they are usually pretty busy The order has rarely been anything but very satisfactory and on the rare occasion there was a problem it was taken care of immediately. It is our favorite Mexican food restaurant.  Unfortunately,  the same cannot be said for the Danville,  Illinois restaurant but that's another review."}
{"text":"The Quality varies greatly, but overall it is no more than Taco Bell with silverware!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, but feel as their margs have lessened in strength of tequila."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Been here for a while now. I love the robust salsa with tomatoes and onions and cilantro. Sooo good. Everyone should try the chicken and cheese quesadilla."}
{"text":"it's quick.  it's fairly inexpensive... but i seem to remember an adage that went something like.....  you get what you pay for.    yep.  that was it.  i have been to this location on springfield several times, and to be honest, it's just alright.   the salsa is sort of flavorless.  the chips are not that great.  they use white american cheese instead of authentic mexican cheeses.  i know because i asked when my quesadilla tasted like a grilled cheese.  the waitress said, \"maybe it's because we use american cheese.\"  yeah.  i bet that's it.    the staff is extremely nice and quick.  i did have one instance in which a waiter wrote himself in a $10 tip on a bill i paid with a credit card.  when i caught it on my credit card statement, i called the manager, marco, and told him.  he gave me the $10 back.  no questions asked.  that was incredibly cool.  not cool someone stole $10 from me... but hey, marco took care of it.  the food isn't terrible, but it is not something that will inspire a diary entry about the day you had the best mexican food in the world.  *********  edited to include the fact that the el toro on south neil street is a much better deal.  they have a special menu for the week with dishes not included on the regular menu.  i ordered a vegetarian burrito from it last week that was the bomb.  it had authentic queso on it and the whole nine.  so... springfield ave, not so much.  neil street, maybe?"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what is going on with this location, but the food and service quality has been very inconsistent as of late. I've been coming here once a week for a while now, and have always ordered the Acapulco Special. That dish is amazing and has everything... steak, chicken, and shrimp covered in queso. The challenge is that the amount of food you receive can vary by 50%. No idea why there is such a large range. Here's a rundown of my last three visits, which were all pickups. 1: Call taker said 5-10 mins, which is usual. I arrived in 10 and they had no record of my order. Thus, it had to be put back in and the wait restarted. 2: Order was ready on time, but it was at 50% the usual... and was missing the chips. (I don't know why I wasn't paying attention that they left it out). 3: (last week) Call taker said 20-30 mins. I figured they were crazy busy, so I arrived at the 20 mark. Parking lot had 8 cars in it... but ok. 20 mins go by and the food hasn't come out, so I check with the counter. (There was another lady waiting for her order and previously asked a different counter person. That person said they would go back and check, but never came back...) Front desk checked in the system and couldn't find my order again, so she rang it back up. Total time from call to receiving my food was 45 mins. When I left, the other lady was still waiting... along with the grubhub guy that arrived shortly after I did. Very disappointed.   Update on 6/23: Why do I never check my bag?!? Didn't receive my salsa last time and they left out my tortillas this time. Get  It  Together ."}
{"text":"The service is terrific.  The food is solid, but nothing really stands out.  Your visit is likely to be a pleasant enough but unmemorable experience.  I usually go when I'm stressed out and can't handle anything unpredictable or far from home.  Ultimately, though, the inexpensive 32 oz Dos Equis drafts keep me coming back."}
{"text":"This place was really hyped up by a lot of my friends and I'm just not seeing it. The food seemed very \"Americanized\" and overall it was mostly very flavorless. Nothing about this restaurant was particularly appealing."}
{"text":"Avoid this place.  Is the service slow? Well, the water in my glass evaporated before they even took our drinks order.  Then it was an equally long wait before they took our food order.  Each time we asked a server for something, they disappeared never to be seen again.  Ridiculous.  The food was okay - standard pseudo-Mexican fare - and the Margarita was tasty, but neither worth another evening of waiting and waiting and waiting."}
{"text":"The food is cheap and service is super fast, always friendly. The place seems busy all of the time too. I think the food is decent at best however. If it wasn't for the prices and fast friendly service my review would be in the one to two star range based solely on the food."}
{"text":"Clearly lacking compared to the one in Urbana. All the waiters act like you're inconveniencing them by asking for the simplest things.... nobody checks on you after your food is given. The foods consistently pretty good but nobody wants to beg you for service."}
{"text":"Busy place. Got seated in bar hoping for a bit faster service. Not. Took order fairly quickly but took 43 minutes to get two combo plates. Waitress did provide 2x salsa (good) and chips (mediocre) and apologized for the delay. Carnitas taco was ok, chicken enchiladas were bland. $3.75 25oz Bud Light made the wait somewhat better. Pretty standard American Mexican food."}
{"text":"Steak tacos were good. Enchilada Del Mar was just okay - crab was spongy and wet, tilapia was crumbly, shrimp was fine. Guacamole was passable. Service was SLOW!"}
{"text":"Always go with the steak taco traditional cilantro and onion toppings with the salsa verde on one and red on another. Great flavor for the steak, little different tasting then I'm accustomed but it was a nice change. Same for the rice and beans. I'm not really sure what the flavor is but totally different, still authentic tasting and sure finished trying to figure it out. Definite stop for solid Mexican!!"}
{"text":"This place was alright. Nothing too fancy or anything. Typical tex-mex cuisine. Pretty large dining room and they have a room for large groups, which was where I was seated."}
{"text":"The Chips and salsa are good, not great.  And the place is always crowded so i'm left wondering, What am i missing?  Its decidedly Average, nothing outstanding here."}
{"text":"Food was fine and as fast as one expects at an El Toro but service was strange. The first waiter got my order wrong then was obviously angry and suddenly we had a new waiter. But he appeared to be solicitous to the nearby tables so maybe it was just me."}
{"text":"here's my theory behind Mexican restaurants: \"Its all about the tacos\" If you cannot execute a proper taco nothing else really matters. The tacos are served on flour tortillas with lettuce and cheese and tomatoes. I'm a corn tortilla onions and cilantro kinda girl myself- but even past that the tacos are poorly done. They use a lot of fatty low quality ground beef and even their enchiladas are sloppy and disgusting and the Chile Rellano is literally sitting in an ocean of grease. I assume this is the kind of place people go to drink with large crowds knowing the food is gross. Overall: Not authentic and the quality is terrible. If you are craving Tacos go to Maize. If you want to sit down and skip the crowds Mas Amigos is so much better. This place is basically a taco bell with a wait staff! Eek Me thinks not!"}
{"text":"I don't think this place gets enough credit. We come about 4 times a month. Service is always fast and friendly in the bar. We found that the specialty dishs are far better then standard combo plates. Salsas good most if the time, when it's busy sometimes it's watered down. I don't necessarily think it's a five star but I think it's more of a 3.5 than a 2.5."}
{"text":"I come in town a few times a year and eat here. The service has always been good and the food has been very good.  I did ask for a copy of my itemized bill one time to no luck. Waited about 10min and went up and asked and he could not produce it and said sorry.  Wish he had come told me and not had me sitting there. Other than that the food has always been very good. I get a shrimp dish. Others get their fajitas."}
{"text":"Only because I was on this side of town did I choose to visit this El Toro location.  Should know better than to think I could get a comparable meal to El Toro Loco (Urbana).  Staff unfriendly. Waiter was slow.  Food is OK. Definitely not El Toro Loco   Steak taco had plenty of meat. Which is always a plus. I believe I have been to this location 3 times and every time I  seated right inside restaurant next to the area where the waiters put dirty dishes and get drinks. Very disruptive. Should i ask for a different booth or table. Probably but don't want to be a pain."}
{"text":"Top notch tacos al pastor! They were a specialty item that they mentioned had just turned into a permanent change. I lived in Mexico for a couple years and became very attached to the unique Mexican meat. This is one of the few places that comes close to what you'll find on the streets of the Mexico City. The pineapple ratio was right also and served with dos tortillas like it ought to be. It drops a star because my wife's taquitos were a bit overdone and the meat was a bit on the dry side. Moreover, the beans and rice are the normal substandard American-style Mexican food that's served everywhere - crappy canned pinto beans that just spread all over the place and taste bland. The rice was the same class of Mexican rice.  But this is a local's favorite, whether it's this location or the other ones. We live around the corner and the place is literally completely filled, even with a large parking lot, every weekend without question. Go on a weekday or hit the dinner around 4:30/5pm to beat the crowds. Also, be sure to snag the fried ice cream. The honey they add on makes it some of the most unique I've had and it's a good dish, even to share if you're full."}
{"text":"They moved a couple blocks down the street from their original Springfield site (which is now a Thai place) a little over a year ago, into a brand new, much bigger building.  But the waitstaff and food remains the same = great.  We do lunch here because it is so close to the plant.  In and out in way less than an hour, for under $10.  Deal!  Tons of combination plates, with choices to please everyone (lunch combos average $5, with larger combos at $7-8).  Nice seafood and veg options.  Hot chips and mild, flavorful salsa.  And white cheese dip - hello!!"}
{"text":"Typically this place is fine...not tonight! We ordered take out. Enchiladas and two Pollos with white cheese dip. The cheese dip was maybe 1/4 of a cup and one tiny thing of salsa. We had asked for some extra salsa...I guess a thimble full is all you need for 3 meals. When my husband arrived to pick up our food, our order was sitting there. And he waited for close to 30 minutes! We have ordered take out several times in the past...this may be our last! I chose this as my birthday meal today...I am so disappointed!"}
{"text":"It's certainly not bad, but not the best in town. Chips aren't that great, and the salsa is just ok. The food is decent but not the great, fresh taste that you get at other local places- and it all kinda tastes the same. The lunch specials are priced great, though. I probably wouldn't come here so often (once a week or more) if it wasn't so close and I weren't strapped for time."}
{"text":"The vegetarian options are good.  Filling.  Beans and rice are meh."}
{"text":"Breakfast?  Brunch?  I'm always intrigued by the potential of the morning feast taking place at a Mexican spot.  You know it's going to be a nice twist on two very familiar things - Tex-Mex food and breakfast.  The location is welcoming and we were greeted walking in quickly lead to a table table and given coffee.  I noted a half dozen other diners in various stages of eating, ordering finishing up.  A quick glance around confirmed the dishes looked very appealing on the multi colored Fiesta ware.   The menu is larger than I expected and included both gringo and Tex/Mex options.  I did notice that most of the southwest options did not include a protein other than eggs which was a little disappointing.  I was very interested in the Huevos Rancheros, but couldn't get Chilaquiles of my mind.  What I expected was fried corn tortillas softened in a complex red mole, topped with velvety scrambled eggs, thick and cool creme fresh, crunchy sharp onions and a bit of tangy queso fresco along with a side of tortillas, creamy fatty refried beans and tomatoy rice.  What I got?  What I got was not only a diet plate portion, but also the version of Chilaquiles with crunchy chips.  The thick red salsa/mole was pooled on the bottom of the pile of chips, some warm salsa, disappointing canned beans and dry flavorless rice, etc, etc. etc.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, just not what I expected and so I can say that if you are looking for something a little different than the two eggs, bacon and hashed brunch, this could be a good spot to try."}
{"text":"My whole family loves this place. Great food and it's served quick and hot, even the busiest nights the service is good. The chips & salsa are practially a meal and you can't go wrong with the Pollo Asado. The lunch menu is a favorite for me & friends, especially the Chicken Fajita plate."}
{"text":"What can I say, I love me some El Toro!  Food is typical Mexican fare, prices are good, and they're really fun to take someone on their birthday. (Think sombrero + tequila shot... or fried ice cream if it's a weekday lunch)."}
{"text":"A Midwest anomaly, I've eaten here many times because it's so popular here, but I've yet to have anything that tastes like Mexican or really anything at all. It's extremely bland. If you go bring spices with you & not just the hot stuff they just heat the food and bring it out. Maybe it's for Americans that don't actually like Mexican food."}
{"text":"A very nice, new building with an ambient, comfortable atmosphere.  The servers are very prompt and polite.  The food is just kind of mediocre and blah.  It's the typical Americanized Mexican food that you'll get at any other El Toro or at Dos Reales.  Lots of ground beef, ranchero sauce, and salt."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I get lunch from El torro bravo a few times a month. Although it's convenient because of the Location, the quality really is hit and miss. Some lunches are incredible, but this past week I ordered 3 chicken tacos. 2 I asked be made with shredded chicken, the 3rd grilled. The grilled chicken was over cooked to the point it was almost impossible to bite through it, and my shredded chicken tacos came out basically a soup with a soft shell tortilla wrapped around it. Because they hadn't drained the chicken at all, the tortilla turned to mush. The flavor was good, but way too wet. The workers are very friendly, and they are always busy, just beware that the quality changes from day to day."}
{"text":"Good food, and a wonderfully friendly staff. The more you go, the more they treat you like family. Love the place."}
{"text":"The food here is decent, considering it's not a primarily Mexican or Hispanic town. The margaritas tasted watered down...hardly alcoholic at all. Customer service was good and we didn't have to wait long, even though it was the lunch rush. Seafood enchiladas are probably something I'd get, but I think their tamales could have been a lot better."}
{"text":"Overall, this place was solid, but it didn't wow me. The chips were quite good and the salsa pretty good. The guacamole was great. I'm told this place has great margaritas, but can't say personally. My meal, a combo platter including chile relleno, enchildas, and rice and beans, was all okay.  The service was equally fine without being particularly good or bad. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"The first time I ever experienced what is now El Toro Bravo was in 2000! They were at the old location (El Torero). The food was incredible then - spicy and full of flavor. It was really something special to eat there. Since they moved to their new location, their quality has gotten worse and worse with each visit. I always ordered chicken fajitas, coctel de camarones (salsa aparte) or chiles poblanos. Every last one now is a greasy, sloppy, flavorless dish. This chain started from one tiny restaurant and expanded into a Mexican McDonalds. Cheap food, low quality, nothing special."}
{"text":"Seems like always packed when I drive by here but I am not a fan. Maybe will give another try sometime but not even as good as Dos Reales and that is not a high bar to jump over."}
