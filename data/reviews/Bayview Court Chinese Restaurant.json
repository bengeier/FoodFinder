{"text":"Food choice is wide. Too oily and salty, price not cheap."}
{"text":"I've dined at this establishment many times and love this place. The food is good and price is great. Before, for Chinese fast food dining I use to go to Richmond Court, I found Richmond Court was too greasy, and quality and presentation below average. Decorations inside this restaurant gives it character, and the high ceiling certainly improves the dining experience. My favourites: fish cooked in clay pot, rice noodle with beef, beef brisket in clay pot (these are not correct names from menu - just from my memory) Service is above average for a Chinese restaurant establishment, certainly leaps and bounds better than Richmond Court. Be warned that it can get very busy during Friday and Saturday dinner."}
{"text":"Came here with my friends and family for gatherings. The house special OX tail with mild sauce is really good, it is tender and nicely braised, tasty and yummy. Would recommend this dish. Also we have try the House of deep fried bean curd, which is crispy but it's a little plain to me, if you like tofu dish you will love it. The Chiu Chow Soy Sauce duck is a bit plain, I have try the duck in one of the famous Chiu Chow place in New York and it is taste much better. A little bit disappoint on the duck. However, the service is great, the place is clean and food is good, would recommend it."}
{"text":"This is my family's go to restaurant when we want something fast and we don't know what to eat. We come here for wonton noodle soup (I think that's what it's called in english haha), fried rice, steamed fish, and other random Asian things I don't the the names of in english (sorry!). And I haven't tried the dim sum here... but i probably wouldn't, there doesn't see to be much of a selective here.  They also have this \"dessert\" thing where it's pan-friend (not sure) crunchy noodles cut up into slices and you eat it with vinegar and sugar. for some reason I really like it lol  Staff here are pretty attentive and food comes out quick! Atmosphere is not too bad, the decor is nice to look at, makes me feel like I'm in a Chinese history museum.   Overall if you're looking for a quick bite, come here!"}
{"text":"Allways fresh  Good portions  Good value  Friendly  The staff is friendly, there lots of parking and for is always hot and fresh  I have been here 5 times so far"}
{"text":"We found this place to eat dinner during our stay in Canada.  The food was good and the services was wonderful."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating from here.  It was very fresh and very tasty.  Its not your typical canadianized fare, there are no chicken balls or egg rolls.  The portions were large too making for great value.  If I had any criticisms or complaints, they'd be lame ones like their takeout containers could be nicer and that they should take credit cards on delivery orders (they accept debit), but those are rather insignificant.  Again, great food with lots of flavour and fresh ingredients and little to no MSG from what I could tell.    I highly recommend a try."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time going to Bayview S.S. back in the days. Food is good, customer service is good. Their decor is unique. My favourite dish still is their fried dumplings. There is no other restaurant that makes it their way. You can not FIND no other who can replicate the way they make it and the way it tastes.  What's sad is they don't do delivery during lunch time, only dinner."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot for lunch when I was in high school. The food is pretty good and the portions are good. The price is decent and the food comes quickly. Nice restaurant to grab a bit from time to time. Their \"fook-king\" fried rice is really good lol."}
{"text":"its been a while since i got to rate something with 4 stars but I'm glad I finally got to try this restaurant I pass by all the time but always seemed to ignore. The food is pretty good. The prices are pretty standard at 8-14 per dish and because I always found myself driving to markham to get some decent dimsum, I appreciate this place even more.  Definitely a hongkong themed restaurant with all the decor and pictures hanging on the wall not to mention the cuisine. I normally don't notice interiors that much but somehow they nailed it with their setup as I literally feel like I'm in asia while I dine inside. Service is ok but it also depends on which server you get. A few are friendly, a few not so, which I am used to.  I find the menu more affordable and diverse. I don't notice steamed whole fish available (for $13 only) that often in other mid range priced restaurants so it is definitely a plus.Some restaurants offer dimsum during lunchtime only while I can get it here up until closing time. I must say that Bayview Court is now my official go to chinese restaurant if I want decent food around my area."}
{"text":"I would give it a zero but that option was not available. This will apply to TAKE OUT only since it gives them an opportunity to rip you off. I always eat Asian food, Thai, Japanese etc and have no issues with different cultures. I have lived in Korea, traveled Tokyo, Thailand and Hong Kong.  When i ordered last year and came to pick up, i was missing many items and if i did not open the bag, i would not have noticed. Perhaps i was paranoid, so when ordering the other night i sent my wife to go pick up the food and when she came back many items were missing. I went back and noticed the receipt was a piece of paper with a total.I was polite when i returned and asked for 2 missing items that totaled around 10 bucks. I don't want anything for free since i traveled from Bathurst and Major Mackenzie on principle. I was told by the lady at the take out desk to pay or get out. I said calmly, i will never return if you do not do the honorable thing and provide me my correct meal or my receipt.  Got the impression they don't want foreigners there anyway. Very rude, i believe they purposely screwed the order up. Again, i hope people make an effort and if they do order, insist on a receipt that details your order and open their stapled take away bags, Show them business's need to adhere to proper ethics and principles. I don't want to bash places but start treating paying clients with respect! Food was good, but it helps when you get what you order."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  So this place does one thing that is better than anyone else.  The marinated duck... Delicious.  Would of gotten 5 stars. But I can't find anything else that is good or needs mentioning about"}
{"text":"The decor is nice, and service was quick. Debit or cash only. The food is hit or miss depending on the dish. Passable dishes: pork and chine dumplings, XO turnip and crispy chicken. Gross dishes: Pineapple pork, beef mushroom hot pot.  The dishes above ended up costing us 65-70$ after tax and tip. Verdict: mediocre, would not go back"}
{"text":"Came in with my family for a late lunch. Service was good, food was good. No complaints."}
{"text":"I think this place serves pretty standard Chinese food. I ordered the beef chow mein, and another item I don't know how to translate into English. I was kind of disappointed though, because it was very food court quality, though portions are quite generous. I do wish I had ordered more of the Chiu Chow style foods, since the Chinese name of the restaurant does promote it as a Chiu Chow restaurant, but since it was just my bf and I, we wouldn't have been able to finish all that food, so maybe I'll come back with my family. Overall, this is a decent Chinese restaurant, but it is like any other Chinese restaurant in the GTA, and not worth planning a special visit to. I think I would only return if it's convenient, and I can't find nearby alternatives on Yelp."}
{"text":"Large menu , place is clean and every dish tasted amazing. Downtown authentic Chinatown Place in 905."}
{"text":"Heaps of food graced our presence at the table and so did heaps of oil on the plates. Ew!  I didn't dare stuff myself to my fullest potential as I normally do when I had Chinese. I honestly was disgusted. Chinese food is normally greasy, but this was over-the-top.  The previous reviewer praised Bayview Court - how can my experience be so far off?   Holiday or not, food should never be served with a perma-shine oil glazed coat and a layer of grease to stew in."}
{"text":"The food was good. The ingredients were fresh and portions were fairly big. What I love about Chinese food is that you can eat a lot of food without breaking the bank. There was even enough food for left overs.  One of the dishes that I really enjoyed was the squid, duck, and Chinese greens. My favourite part of this was the steamed duck. It was delicious. Since I was craving this, we ordered the shrimp rice noodle roll. There is quite a lot of shrimp in the roll. We also ordered a noodle dish with beef and Chinese leafy greens. For starters we had the seafood soup with oysters, and rice. It was almost broth like, with bits of rice.    The d√©cor is different with the top part of the restaurant modeled after the traditional Chinese pawn shops. The place is pretty big with lots of seating.  The waiters here were friendly and the service was pretty quick. I'd come back to visit if I was in the area."}

I am very disappointed. .time to get myself some McDonald. ...."}
{"text":"NIce venue...very oriental looking..2 big rooms with tables...i have tried a lot of Chinese food in GTA but I found this place better than others...i personally love the black olives and green bean chicken fried rice and sweet and sour chicken...they give generous portions as well and is pretty inexpensive...  however, the only issue i have is customer service..they demand a tip but have shitty service..they do not come when u call them...they take their sweet time..when you ask for extra cutlery they will roll their eyes, sigh and are just plain rude...and this is not just one server..its the whole staff (especially the female servers) but i really like the male server..he is a sweetheart and very helpful..i always get the feeling that they dont appreciate your business..also for takeout a lott of times they will give you wrong order so i advise that you check your order before you leave the restaurant...  the only reason i go back to this place is because of the food  Also, they only take cash (no $100 bills) or debit..they do not accept credit card  PS: i once wanted to talk to the manager to address some customer service issues (they were being rude) but when i asked to speak to the manager the server told me that \"they\" are the manager"}
{"text":"My friends and I used to come here for lunch quite a bit in high school so we established \"regulars\" status of sorts.. In that sense I can't be objecive about service cuz we were treated quite well. We tried different items from time to time but generally stuck to several core dishes. I know the chiu chow style duck is a specialty here but it's better when served at night so we don't get it during lunch. Anyways, the core dishes we usually get are the fukien fried rice, the raw egg drop on minced beef with rice, satay beef with flat rice noodles and the chiu chow style oyster congee.   All the dishes here have rustic charm. Atmosphere at lunch is really quiet. At nighttime this place is LOUD and usually packed.  If theres one dish you gotta try its the fukien fried rice! REALLY good surprisingly. Not many places do a good one.  My friend came back from cali to visit me and bought some takeout from this joint. Ahhhhh the nostalgia."}
{"text":"Very solid establishment. For me, the best shrimp wonton soup in GTA/Toronto. Other successful dishes: yangchow fried rice, crispy skin chicken, spicy chicken with broccoli and chow mein with BBQ pork and bean sprouts. Service friendly, tea always hot .."}
{"text":"My paths with Chiu Chow cuisine is somewhat limited RELATIVELY speaking. Easily the reason being Cantonese is the default selection by Availability and Taste. I know the very basic orders of a Meal and therefore I will share with you here.   2.5'd  1  -  Braised Meats          -  Duck, etc... 2  -  Chiu Chow Congee  -  Minced Pork, Dried Fish & Diced Oyster 3  -  Oyster Omelette  My mentality with Chiu Chow Food is simple, due to the Food being simple.

{"text":"My first time here in a while. They've done a menu overhaul since then. Got takeout.   Had:  Mango slush - smooth. Not bad. Quite mango-y. Wasn't the right weather for it though. Oh well. Daddy's craving, not mine. Decent price too, if I recall correctly. Under $4.  Deep fried silver fish with salt and pepper - deep fried quite nicely. Salt and pepper served on the side. A tad oily though. What I mean is that when I bit into the fish, there was a gush of oil. Not so nice.  Deep fried tofu with salt and pepper - differs from the house of deep fried tofu. Yes, that's an odd sort of Engrish. Small pieces of tofu. Salt and pepper also served on the side. Good portion for $4.99. I'd order this again.  Stir fried green beans and minced pork - green beans were fresh. Decent amount of pork. Standard though.  Beef brisket and tendon - for $7.99, the portion was ridiculously tiny. There were like 5 pieces of brisket and 4 pieces of tendon. It's like getting the portion one usually gets in soup noodles, but multiplied by 1.5. Quite upsetting. Brisket was not dry and stringy. I'll give them that. Because of the portion though, I won't be ordering this again.  Braised Chinese cucumber with dried shrimp vermicelli - I was expecting a whole lot more vermicelli. This came in two takeout congee containers (Styrofoam). When I opened them, I was quite confused. There was a lot of liquid, and the cucumbers were floating on the top. Upon placing this into a serving dish, we discovered that the shrimps were hardly noticeable, and the amount of vermicelli combined in both containers was about the size of a standard rice bowl. In short, this dish was more a soup than anything else. All liquid, no substance.  Menu - this one's interesting. They don't seem to have a takeout menu, hard copy, that I could find. They also don't provide a full English menu unless one asks for it. Most of their menus have English on the first page, but no English on the rest."}
{"text":"I came here when it first open and it was really decent tasting Chinese food. Now this place specializes in Chiu Chou style of cooking, other than the Cantonese style that the majority of Chinese restaurants do.  As the years progressed the quality of food declined. Usually on a night where we want fast, good food for cheap we would come to this place but now, it's not even an option on the list!   I recently came back as a family friend wanted to come here and the food is still meh but service is always fast. I don't want to sound like the stereotypical person but my Canadian friends LOVE this place, I just find it to be mediocre food but decent service. A HUGE plus though is the fact that they do indeed deliver!"}
{"text":"I normally come here during my huge family gatherings.  Beware though as the food selections here is for the extreme hardcore chinese food eaters.   Everything is authentic chiu chow style food.   If you are looking for amazing chiu chow food in toronto this is the place to be.   Service is great, atmosphere is clean and decorated like you are in the old days.   Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to this restaurant since 2001. I am of Chiu Chow decent (though not born in China) and grew up eating my grandmother's cooking. This restaurant serves some of the dishes from my childhood, my favourite being the Pig Stomach with Salted Veg Soup, heat coming from the large dose of white pepper in it.  It also offers a long list of familiar dishes available at most HK eateries, of which I keep ordering the Cantonese Chow Mein, Beef Wat Tan Hor and Sliced Fish Congee. They really haven't missed the mark with any of the Cantonese dishes I've ordered. My favourite fried rice is the one with minced pork, olives and green beans.  My husband orders their party trays for his staff and everyone enjoys the food. Each tray is good value for great food.   * When one of my kids got diagnosed with a peanut allergy, I was relieved this restaurant took (and continues taking) precautions while preparing our orders.   And now, a review of the chilli oil at the restaurant: Not for the faint hearted so do not start with a heaped spoonful if you haven't tried it before. We buy them by the bottle and use it for cooking, raising the heat in my bowl  and home hot pot. If you're a Spice Seeker like me, add it to their Sliced Fish Congee and you will never go back to non-spicy congee ever again!!"}
{"text":"this place used to be my \"home\" when i was little. i remember always getting their minced beef rice with a raw egg on top, their spicy radish cubes thing, their egg noodle soup and their chicken wings. from what i remember, they tasted pretty good (that's prob cause i was too little and my taste buds haven't fully developed yet LOL) anyways i decided to go back after not having gone for so long and i must say it was a huge disappointment. i got the minced beef egg rice (rice was too hard and gross), lychee bubble tea (100% do not recommend; boba was terrible), their egg noodle soup ( it was pretty good), and their shrimp dumplings (har gow) (TERRIBLE NOT FRESH)   never gonna come again dawgs"}
{"text":"Great service here. Came here several times. We did take out today - ordered curry chicken with rice and fried noodles chicken with satay sauce. The take out menu is very overwhelming as there are a lot of selection , however, the waiter offered my husband to look at the picture of the food. The bill came up to about $23 after tax. Washroom was very clean. Our order took less than 10 min to be ready. The only thing I don't like is the vegetables are not just half cooked. Other than that, the food and service was great!"}
{"text":"Good food - kinda middle of the road.  Can't go wrong, but nothing memorable."}
{"text":"I found Chinese food in Richmond Hill to be hit and miss. Sometimes its great other times its not even close to authentic. This place is closer to the authentic Chinese style of food. Walking in it reminds me of when I visited Hong Kong, although this is not a Cantonese style restaurant, with murals of rice patties and fishing boats on the wall. The decor is what you expect from a casual Chinese restaurant. Nothing special, lots of big round tables, a few booths, dark brown wood, and quick service.   The service was very fast although they had trouble speaking English. It wasn't rude because you can't fault them for not knowing a language so we communicated through pointing at the menu and hand signals. The food came very fast and was fresh. Fried noodles were crispy, sweet and sour pork crunchy, General Tao chicken was spicy, and the green beans were delicious. The food was a bit oily though but nothing too crazy as to where I was unable to eat or it turned me off.  Overall, this is a good restaurant and probably one of the better Chinese fair in Richmond Hill. Prices are decent, food is fast, service is quick, and generally flavorful. If you can trek to the city for good Chinese then go trek but for something in these area its perfect."}
{"text":"This is a family favourite. Great for large groups. The food is good the service is always great and the large menu gives many choices. Have been going here for years."}
{"text":"Though I can't comment on dinner, the lunch here is amazing! Portions are big, service is fast and the food tastes fantastic. I'd recommend the pork and noodle dish. As well, for us Canadians out there...they have a picture book with easy to read/understand dishes available."}
{"text":"A solid place for your chinese food, with all your asian food needs ranging from fried rice, congee, noodles and meats. We got the duck in soya sauce, chicken with chinjew sauce, deep fried silverfish with spicy salt and some stir fried greens. All four dishes was excellent and not too greasy. The duck had really good flavor, it's meant to be a cold dish but doesn't lack in flavor. The chicken is served with a side of fried leaves that gives an extra layer of texture to the thin slices of chicken. The silverfish was fried to a dry crisp but not oily, making them feel like really interesting fries.  The food itself gets a solid three stars, but the service brings it to four. First of all, the servers noticed I couldn't read chinese so they offered the same menu to me in english (everyone one else around the table could read except me). Really appreciated them noticing and offering a solution without me asking. Secondly, we had ordered the snow pea leaves but the kitchen responded that it wasn't in season and were too old to be served. It's good to know that the kitchen has standards. Thirdly, a toddler at the next table started crying and a server in the area nonchalantly handed the mom a stack of napkins without being asked. Definitely a place with good service.  The only drawback are the drinks. I ordered a lychee bubble tea but the tapioca had obviously been sitting around for too long because they had softened a little too far. The liquid itself was really light, refreshing and wasn't too intensely sweet. But the tapioca was a no go. Avoid the bubble tea but maybe the other drinks will be fine."}
{"text":"I hadn't dined at Bayview Court for a long time, but I didn't remember why.  We came for dinner last weekend.  Place was busy.  The prices looked affordable.  So far so good. Food came and it hit both of us why we didn't visit more.  Food was pretty disappointing.  We ordered a hot pot rice and a stir fry vegetable with shrimps.  The shrimps were in shell and were soggy and mushy.  The texture revealed that they were not fresh, as in they had been frozen for a long time as well that the cook did not properly defrost them.  I don't recommend it.  The hot pot was not memorable either."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and they have been consistently good. Good food, portions, price, and service. We really like their take out combo that comes with soup, rice, and half of a duck."}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious food, we usually deal with caddie we just love her :)  I recommend this amazing chinese restaurant to you all."}
{"text":"Provisional 4 Star rating pending a greater sample. Came at 10:15PM just looking for light, inexpensive noodle soup diner.  Chose the Beef Tendon Noodle instead of Wonton as the silky texture of a well made Tendon soup would sooth my cough. I think both were $6.49 or 6.99.   Soup arrived with the biggest heap of Tendons I've ever seen! Bowl was good 25% bigger than I get at Congee Wong/Queen. I actually DIDN'T plan to eat so much as I already had a couple of cheat days that week, but hey, I could eat Beef Tendon out of a barrel and figured this was justice for all those times I didn't get enough Tendon at other places!!   Tendon chunks were yummy and broth was smooth, beefy & tasty. It was just slightly on the saltier side and if I were to nitpick I'd suggest it could have been even more viscous and captured more of that hint of sweetness you get from a high concentration of Tendon, but these are minor points of personal personal taste. The noodles were fine and in the right proportion.  I appreciated the pile of Green Onion on top which I really like - just about every dish that isn't sweet becomes even better with Green Onion!   While there I noticed All-Day DimSum available which inspired me  to get the Steamed Pork and Har Gow Dumplings.  They seemed about average in taste with a nice plump texture and maybe a tad bigger than typical. Good enough for a snack or side.    Nice clean place with very high ceiling, well lit, soft, soothing pastel colours and comfortable amount of space between tables. Washroom is very small but maintenance much better than average for the segment.     Definitely earned another visit to try more items - if I can resist getting the Tendon soup every time."}
{"text":"For Authentic Chiu Chow cuisine that I can only get if in Hong Kong. I never miss coming here every year when I am in Canada. The ultimate favorite is the oyster rice soup! Cold appetizers combo with tofu, duck gizzard and jelly fish all so tasty! Fried rice, free ranch chicken, vegetable all wonderfully delicious! Can't wait till my next visit!"}
{"text":"3.5/5  We decided to stop by here since we were in the nearby area and wanted an early dinner (mind you I never have dinner at 5pm, let alone 6pm). I've been here a few times before, but was too young to remember how good (or bad) it was. My grandma and I ordered a simple congee, dough fritter noodle roll, cuttlefish ball noodle soup, and an iced lemon tea.  The congee was very good! I'm not a congee person at all, but after having a few sips from my grandma I ended up having two servings for myself. The dough fritter noodle roll was good as well, about to par with what you expect in established dim sum restaurants. The cuttlefish ball noodle soup was average, it used to be better in the past though...they cheaped out on the cuttlefish balls this time around. Finally, the iced lemon tea is meh...lemons were too thin and the tea was too bitter for my liking.  Since service was only so-so, rating will be rounded down to 3 stars for this one."}
{"text":"I've visited the place several times. It is a type that serves oriental food that is still authentic but suitable for western palate.   As you would expect, the food is better than a version of that at some fast food place. My favourite item is a plate of egg noodles and seafood soaked in some source that makes it sort of gooey that probably delivers more calories than a Big Mac. These big plates are made for sharing."}
{"text":"5/5 for authentic Chinese food and great prices. Usually pretty busy but rarely do you have to wait for seating unless your with a large group."}
{"text":"Chinese food at Bayview Court is simple, tasty and usually right on the mark. Very popular with the younger crowd, serving bubble teas and larger than average portions of reasonably-priced Cantonese food (not to mention being located right beside a school), I've never ever seen this place close to empty, even at down-times.  While first impressions are not always the greatest here, that is the place could be cleaner, the plastic-covered and incredibly well-used menus that could use replacing and the general lack of ambience is made up for by the consistent food and familiar sounds of clinking china.  The staff is friendly and helpful. I went there once with a friend on a diet and not only did they explain how the dish could be prepared using different methods, they replaced the dish entirely when she misunderstood and still ordered something she couldn't eat with the same thing prepared in a way she could eat."}
{"text":"Went here as a group. It was not bad. I have to complain though about their menu. CBCs & the rest of the non Chinese population ... must be so annoyed cuz the entire menu was mostly in Chinese. Not to mention lots of variety but anyhow thank goodness for the photos. I had to read ever so slowly...Fortunately the group was fluent so there were no probs ordering.   Service was very fast. They actually brought a dish that we did not order (1/2 duck). None of us realized it as we ordered from the set menu. How can u get this wrong?The waiter later came by and said it isn't ours and if we want it we could add it to the tab. Sorry we aren't paying extra for your mistake. So he took it back to the kitchen. Makes u wonder if they are just going to recycle that to the next table ? They should've comped it for us since it was half eaten cuz now I just had to yelp about this :)   The food was alright. I'm not a big fan of Chiu Jau style but its fine. I liked the soup best. The shanghai style noodles I thought was a bit undercooked. The fish ...my friends loved it but I beg to differ. It was prob because I am not a fan of Chiu Jau in general lol Price was def good."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. The staff are super friendly if you are a regular they know you and always welcome you with a warm greeting . Their prices are very good and the quality and taste of the food is really good as well. Two things I definite recommend here to order are the shrimp seaweed deep fried rolls and the chicken corn soup it's so good ."}
{"text":"A solo dinner last night gave me the opportunity to try a new place without the pressure of having to impress any company, and for some reason this place has been in my bookmarks for a while. Very clean, well-decorated and the service was a pleasant surprise.  As for the food, not anything to return for. I decided to go for the dim sum and hit all the staples. Har gow, shiu mai, beef rice noodle rolls, shanghai pork dumplings and pan-fried pork and chive dumplings. Everything was pretty tasty, but it was far from impressive and nothing really hit the spot. The shrimp in the har gow was crunchy, the beef in the rice noodle roll was gummy, and the Shanghai dumplings were too doughy. On a positive note, the shiu mai were tender and flavourful, and the pan fried pork dumplings with chive are a must.  Not sure I'd return, but most people seemed to go for the congee and other soups, so maybe I focused on the wrong part of the menu?"}
{"text":"I'm a regular, and really love the food here.  Very good selection and very reasonable prices,   If you're not looking for a high end atmosphere, yet you want to enjoy some really good Chinese food, then this is your place.  I like their shrimp dumplings, vegetable fried rice, chicken and veg stir fry, spicy beef and mushrooms, shrimp spring rolls, hot shrimps, and the chicken sweet corn soup.  I would suggest to avoid ordering the juices, not too good.   And if your server doesn't understand English well, then ask for another server. I always ask for Cathy to take out order. Some of the other servers may mix up your order.   Conclusion, I will always visit Bayview Court when in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Addicted to their salty spicy squid, their beef with XO and rice noodles and the crunchy  satay chicken and a order of the sui  mae. Yum. I live close and almost always phone for take away.  The restaurant is typical Chinese place, big round tables, always very crowded and noisy, but hey sometime that is what you want right?"}
{"text":"Good for the price and close to home. This place gets super busy during weekday lunch. On an extremely tired weeknight this place menu is so easy to read and pick your food, you can be a walking zombie and still ordered the right stuff with a good price :)  Time for bed Zzzzzzzzzz...  Highlight of the visit: 2 dishes, 2 soups and a rice dish for $24.99. Can't go wrong!  Food (Taste): 3.5/5 Food (Presentation): 3/5 Kitchen (Delivery Speed): 4/5 Service: 3/5 Ambiance: 3/5 Fun Factor: 1/5"}
{"text":"Just had dim sum lunch here. Very good, though limited dim sum dishes. Dont expect the 50+ items like some other places. Just the standard stuff. Har gow, shu mai and BBQ pork rice noodle roll (wasn't expecting this and was delighted) were very fresh, piping hot and substantial portions. Will go back again for a quick dim sum fix.   Update: went again for lunch and it was just as good. Shrimp wonton soup was excellent. Big, juicy wontons in a huge bowl of egg noodle soup. And had to have the BBQ pork rice noodle roll again!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I ever eat at Bayview Court even though I been driving by it numerous time! (Ok, I ate here because the Malaysia restaurant across the street is closed and I want to yelp about some restaurant)  There were only another table when I went in on a Monday late afternoon. The service is fast. I tried to stay away from the oily food like stired fried and deep fried as per previous yelpers complained about the amount of oil. I ordered a  home made fish ball rice noodle soup which suppose to be a Chiu Chou Style food.  There are 5 fish balls and 4 fish slices. The fish balls are quite tasty, yes they tasted home made, not like the ones I got from a package in the supermarket. The size of the noodle is nice..just perfect. But it does not taste like Chiu Chou fish ball noodle as there are not garnishes like perserved \"winter\" vegetables or seaweed..  The menu does have a lot of varieties and the price is good. I guess if you come with a whole group of people, this place is a good choice since there are something for everyone.  No lunch special!  Cash only!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.  Entered restaurant at 2:50pm and sat down.  Ordered 1 Fookin Fried Rice and a Black Bean Chicken Fried Noodle at 2:55pm.  Was told would have to wait 10 minutes as chefs are having lunch, not a problem.  Still no sign of anyone working at 3:15pm and asked waitress how much longer is the wait.  Was then told at least another 15 to 20 minutes wait!  That's 35 to 40 minutes from the time we order!!  At least 6 chefs were having lunch together chit chatting when we decided to walk out.  Absolutely ridiculous!  If you were to remain open then at least have 1 person working at all times, even if it means it takes longer than usual but at least food would still be coming.  Bloody close the doors if you wanna have a long lunch gathering!!!  Never ever will I go to this place again and sure will tell everyone I know if this horrific experience!"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times and I got to say the food is pretty good. The food always feels homey and authentic Chiu Chow cuisine.  For the price you get a very large portion of food. Service is pretty quick.   Decor is unique too, they try to capture the 60's into the restaurant.  Take out around the dinner time seems to be very popular, always a line up for take out. I would recommend calling ahead to order your food or else there might be a slight wait if you order on the spot."}
