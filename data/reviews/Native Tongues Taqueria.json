{"text":"Great food and hardworking, knowledgeable staff.  The Staff know their menu inside and out, offering recommendations on both drinks and food. At least our waitress did. And it's great, fresh food. Definitely on the lighter side which is a nice addition to the Mexican mix in the city.  Order more Tacos than you think you'll want. They go down quickly.  A great addition to our city."}
{"text":"Overview: really tasty, surprisingly reasonably priced tacos and other mexi-cuisine in a tasteful beltline dining room. The service was also really friendly, knowledgable and attentive.   For starters don't pass on the guacamole - probably the best I've had in town, topped with ample cilantro and fresh Serrano chiles.   For tacos I tried the chorizo, lengua, and carnitas. They all came simply prepared, topped with cilantro and onion - with a side of red and green salsas. My favorite was the carnitas, followed by the lengua (I'm a sucker for cow tongue, the concentrated beef flavor just can't be beat), last place went to the chorizo which had a slightly different taste than the chorizos you're used to, somewhat salty and not very spicy.  Note that the tacos are small - street style tacos, so order accordingly, but you can always order more as needed.  For six tacos, chips and guacamole, and pickled veg (no drinks) our tab only came to $40, which for the quality of the meal, full bellies and satisfied smiles we left with, was very good value. I'll definitely be back, it's great to have a modern taqueria like this in yyc!"}
{"text":"I have searched for great tacos since leaving California, USA and I had to leave the US to find them.  Go early for a more comfortable atmosphere.  We sat at the very small bar and had a great time watching the bar and kitchen.  We tried the ceviche, yummy.  If you are used to mexican ceviche this will be a delicious surprise.  The chunks of ahi were perfect.  I have been waiting for a bean taco for 10 years and they put together a clean taco.  When it comes to a bean taco simple is better.  My husband claims the pork taco his favorite.  The shrimp was flavorful and with a touch of lime for heat they were heaven.  We finished the meal with a corn on the cob top with cheese and salsa.  I am on a ristricted diet and was so happy that I had a bam bam and a me gusta tu cocktail.  I put the bar tender to the test for my after dinner cocktail and he created an old fashioned with rum.  This tasted almost like the real deal.  We had a great time and I look forward to returning the next time in Calgary."}
{"text":"Great food!  Chairs not that comfortable but excellent food!"}
{"text":"Native Tongues was a great experience. Having never been, our server briefed us thoroughly on our options and was warm and friendly. The atmosphere was inviting, interesting, and well thought out.   The tacos are a little pricey, but filling. One, plus the salsa sampler and chips, was a great introduction to this sweet spot in the beltline."}
{"text":"After kept hearing about this place and reading the great reviews, my friends and I finally managed to organize a day to check this place out.  Boy am I glad that we did, because it certainly met up to it's nice reviews on yelp.  I'm glad that we came to this place, worth every penny we spent there.  Next time I'm in the area, I will start off with this place, and will end with it as well."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was great, music was great. Glazed donut was spectacular. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Would come back for the pozole alone.  Husband had the tacos and while small were tasty.  Salsas were great and they serve Rosso coffee."}
{"text":"This place is THE BEST. I thought I loved Anjeo for tacos and tequila... but this place has better tacos at a lower price. The Carnitas is some of the best I've had in Calgary!  I've been twice now, and it's been great both times. The first time, I got the guac to start and a carnitas taco, a beef tongue taco and a chorizo taco. The guacamole is INCREDIBLE. Just the best. It's super lime-y and cilantro-y and the chips are perfect. They even give you enough chips to finish the guac. All of the tacos I got were fantastic. The canitas is a particular standout - they were just amazing.  The second time I went, I got the guac again (because it is SOOOO GOOD. Seriously, get the guac!), and was with two friends so we decided to split the mole chicken share plate tacos. Also very good. The sauce was awesome and it was big enough to feed 3 people.  Everything is really reasonably priced for what you get. The drinks are a bit pricey, but they have unique ingredients and are quite tasty."}
{"text":"i love taco and have been to many different places in Canada. compare to other taco restaurant like (La taqueria, Tacofino in Vancouver, Tres Carnales Taquer√≠a in Edmonton), this place is too expensive. food was ok not as great as other Taco restaurants. it tastes a little bland to me."}
{"text":"Sadly, we were unable to try the food because the wait staff would not seat us (even tho the restaurant was 3/4s empty). At 6pm on a Monday (during a recession), 2 of us wanted to meet ahead of a few others joining us later and the staff took exception to this and refused to seat us until all members of our party had arrived (seriously, the place was mostly empty!) (\"NO TACOS FOR YOU!\" was their attitude)   We had a delightful dinner at YellowDoor Bistro a block away and the staff there treated us wonderfully!    This is not only about the $400 that Native Tongues didn't get this time, but as a foodie group, they aren't getting our business in the future either!  The staff attitude was a zero (if I could rate it that low)."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I wish they had a 3.5 star. I really wanted to give this restaurant a 4 or 5 as I love their other restaurants Ox and Angela and Una. Starting with taste this place would be rated a 4-5. We had the chips and guacamole for an appetizer, then shared three tacos (tacos are very small), and then had the barbacoa (lamb neck). Looking back this place probably would have received a higher rating from me was it not for the chips and guacamole. The guacamole was fairly average and cost $12. That's right, $12 for chips and guacamole!! Now that's not the worst part, they didn't give enough chips and so I asked for some more chips and when I got the bill saw that they actually charged more for chips. This was ridiculous, you charge $12 for something that many Mexican restaurants give for free and then charge for more chips? Overall this is a great restaurant for taste but in my opinion is way to expensive for Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth a visit. It is definitely the best taco place I have visited in the city First off we went there around 830 on a Friday night. Yes, it was packed.  Yes, we waited 30 minutes for a table but honestly it was painless and they have an app based wait system which is amazing (the app shows you what number you are in line and sends a notification to you when the table is ready). People who complain about a 30 minute restaurant wait on a Friday night are probably the same people who complain about the food at a 3 star all inclusive in Cuba - but I digress.  We elected to sit at the bar. The service was amazing. Drinks are great with a large emphasis on tequila - ask for a tequila old fashioned even though it isn't on the menu. We had the cactus salad appetizer which had a nice kick to it and a great all around dish. For tacos, we had the pork belly and it was delicious. My only problem is that the sides were somewhat lacking and we could've used a few more toppings for the tacos  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food but NOT this restaurant! I so wanted to like it both times I've been but the portions are small and very expensive! The chips and guacamole were $15 and the chips were stale and seemed to be from a bag; and 2$ extra for a side of salsa in a SMALL salad dressing dish. The tacos were the size of my palm and $3.50 for ONE. Yes the meat was delicious but not worth that amount of cash. I'll just wait for my next Mexican vacation to eat quality Mexican for a good price."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service, and eats. It's nice having the occasional special tacos (pork belly). I am not a fan of guac usually but the chips and guac is great. One downside is the chips tend to be hit and miss and can be very very salty sometimes. Never found myself looking around for service or being frustrated trying to get a servers attention, you definitely feel taken care of."}
{"text":"Absolutely great. As close to true Mexican as I've had outside of home. I will be back. Great job!"}
{"text":"The red and green salsa are very tasty and they have a spicier habanero based salsa you can order as well.  The cebollas on the side are always a must and I would have to say my favorite taco in the menu is the hongos."}
{"text":"The only good thing here was the chips and guacamole, but quite expensive at 15$.  Everything else that came out after that was very bad. The burger tasted like mcdonalds and the chips that came with the burger were cold and soggy. The tacos are also quite pricey at 3.50 each and were cold and not that great. Also the service was quite poor, we sat there for 15 minutes waiting to order, and no one checked up on how our meal was. Overall, a very poor experience and would not return"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great price and amazing quality food.  Staff is friendly, convenient location in the heart of dt."}
{"text":"I stop by often for their take out burritos! Super yummy, fresh and quick. Just like the rest of their menu the burritos are flavourful. You can choose from a couple of meat options depending on what they have for the day. Size is good!   Their brunch menu is also amazing and luckily for us it is not very busy! Love the pezole soup."}
{"text":"Simply put, this Mexican place is in a category of its own in Calgary. For corn tortilla aficionados, the ones here are made in house from scratch from hominy...none of this masa flour nonsense! The fillings are classic and flavourful, with both red and green hot sauces furnished for your spicing pleasure, and two vegetarian filling options are available. If you want the real deal, go here now. Not cheap, but a daily happy hour 2-5pm gets you 3 tacos and a Tecate tall boy for $15. Barring an interest in cerveza, their is a great list of inventive tequila and mezcal based cocktails (my wife swears mezcal is the new bourbon).  We sat at the bar. The service was quick, and we drooled over the wood fired grill. Will have to go for one of the asada plates and report back with an update...FWIW if you're not into tacos the hamburger is really top notch."}
{"text":"The menu is really amazing, definitely something for everyone! Really good for groups because of the sharing nature of the menu, and all the great cocktails to choose from! The only two negatives is they don't take reservations, and at some tables you have to make room for people you don't know, which can get a little cramped and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Literally the best tacos I've ever had. Happy hour and Taco Tuesday are totally worth your wait!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience both times with lots of vegetarian options.   Firstly is great addition to the neighbourhood, has a very quirky atmosphere. Our server was excellent and helped us navigate the tapas style menus.   Vegetarians don't worry there is plenty on this menu to satisfy."}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESS! Best Taco place in Calgary hands down!!!! The flavour and variety of food there is incredible...I could have eaten everything twice if my stomach had allowed for it.   We went there for a birthday lunch, and made sure we got there early enough as they don't take reservations. The decor is super cool and plenty of staff around that are helping out. We started with the Esquites, which is this braised corn dish and I have never tried anything like it. Simple yet so flavourful and will be back to order jut 5 of these. Next we shared the Ceviche which is nicely presented, and delicious chunks of tuna on guacamole and a giant round nacho. Another item to not miss is their Tijuana caesar. It's not just any kind of caesar, but creamy, crunchy and a little bit of char from the grill topped off with these amazing homemade croutons. And the of course their tacos, we went for the little guys as didn't have a ton of time but not disappointed. We had to sit there an just take in the tastes of each taco before trying the next one as we didn't want the taste to leave our mouth!  On top of it all, we got the bill and was pleasantly surprised! Very decently priced for the quality of food. I will definitely be back, probably over the weekend as I want to introduce this place to everyone I know! Any excuse to go back."}
{"text":"Given this place a couple chances, and I haven't been wowed. The space is amazing, but the food is not my cup of tea. I understand the concept, and I have tried my fair share of authentic mexican food and this stuff just feels like a restaurant group trying to capitalize on the concept and they've missed the mark on the food. It feels like they've taken traditional Mexican and tried to make it better. Our service was okay, the server seemed kind of pissed off or stressed and you could sense it. Also so expensive.. I might make my way back to try different things on the menu, but for now my impression from going there 3 times now is meh."}
{"text":"Great new taco joint, much needed in YYC. Loved the roasted corn, guacamole, pork and mushroom tacos! Cool vibe, excellent service. We will be back and bringing our amigos !"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. But more expensive than I think it's worth.  The service was also really slow."}
{"text":"We picked the wrong time to go, it was really busy and we sat at a bar near the door. Those bar chairs are as uncomfortable as they look and my son kept bumping elbows with the people squished in next to us.  We ordered 1 bean tostada, which was good, and the Chilaquiles which were also good.  I'm not a spicy food lover and I was able to eat most of this.  Our server didn't think we'd have enough food, but we were fine and had barely enough enough room for the donut and shortbread cookie desserts.  We left uncomfortably full.  The main dishes, though good, were very expensive for the size. If we go back it will be during happy hour."}
{"text":"First experience wasn't bad. Appetizers and cocktails were great. The main course Cecina (pork) was dry.   The second visit didn't happen. Hostess took our cell phone number and never called. We walked by 90 minutes later to see empty tables.   Not sure we'll return. If you don't take reservations, you'd better have an organized hostess staff. Not worth wasting another Friday night for."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this restaurant!! Everything on the menu is amazing and the Mescal Margaritas are top shelf!!! I will keep on going back!!!"}
{"text":"The experience was overshadowed by policy. They want you in an out fast. If your waiting for another member of your party to arrive they continuously harass and make you all sit at one end of the table so they can seat strangers at your table incase there is a sudden demand. Staff was obnoxious and not focused on the quality of our experience or what good service means. Food was good but the experience was horrible. I will give my business to restaurants that care more about the quality of the customers experience over the bottom line."}
{"text":"Decent place with a good selection of food. Atmosphere is quite pleasant, and service is always good. Pretty authentic Mexican restaurant that does it well. Insider tip: order the house made guac. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"I will keep it succinct and sweet. The quality of the ingredients , ambience and service were  all top notch. However this establishment only gets 3 stars due to the petite nature of the serving size , after my meal I went home and roasted some yams and beets because I was still hungry. In closing , rad establishment that is diminished but small serving sizes and cost."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I went in a group of 4 on a Wednesday night and were seated promptly after all of our party arrived (note: they WILL NOT seat parties unless everyone is present. The place is fairly small, so this is perfectly reasonable).  We all had the Car2Go \"Ride2Dine\" set menu, where each time the menu is ordered, a free meal is donated to Mealshare. The menu consisted of:  Zanahorias: grilled carrots, crema, quesco fresco, cilantro - This was a great simple starter. Grilled carrots in a fresh tasting savoury (little sweet) sauce. The copious portions were representative of the rest of the items in the menu as well.  Pollo Rostizado: grilled chicken, mote verde, rice, refried beans, tortillas - Basically a \"build your own taco\". It's a delicious and tender quarter chicken with herbal seasoning and sides. Cut up the chicken and add it and the sides to the tortillas, or just eat everything separately for a \"deconstructed\" taco. The seasoning on the chicken was great. Flavourful but not too salty.  Flan de Chocolate: chocolate flan, salted caramel, almond and coconut granola - I'm not huge on desserts but this was delicious. Funny story: we were given a single plate of flan thinking it was to share between the four of us. We were perfectly content after finishing the plate, but our waiter told us the kitchen made a mistake and there were THREE MORE plates coming! We told him that wouldn't be necessary and one more would be perfect. They don't mess around with the portions here and you will DEFINITELY get your money's worth.  All in all a great experience. It's a fun, unique atmosphere, with great decor, friendly staff, and awesome food. Definitely recommended!  Just remember that they won't seat a table until everybody is present. The restaurant is also smallish, so definitely call ahead if you're bringing a group of say, 6 or more."}
{"text":"Great Taco tuesday, Delicious food and exceptional service."}
{"text":"I would give 3.5 if that was possible in Yelp. Being intimately familiar with Mexican food, usually my standards for this type of cuisine are really high. Our experience can be summarized as the good, the bad and the ugly.  The good: Appies and entrees. Excellent quality of ingredients, taste was also great and authentic. Luckily, the chef does not shy away from hot chilies! We tried the chilaquiles, cactus, tamales, and tacos (mushroom and bean - their only vegetarian options). Delicious.  The bad: Dessert. The selection is very small (a donut, a tres leches cake and a chocolate flan). We had the tres leches cake, which is an authentic Mexican type of dessert. However, the execution was really bad - the cake tasted more like a heavy coconut pound cake. Flavour was not even remotely related to authentic tres leches cake.  The ugly: The \"no reservation system\". In fact, they do use the \"no wait\" app, and plenty of people seem to know that. Yet, they deny this fact at the very door of the restaurant, even when the hostess is constantly monitoring the wait list through the \"no wait\" app and calling users (who were not standing anywhere around the restaurant) to inform their table is ready. We waited over 45 minutes for a table for 2. Groups of over 4 people not using the app were being told that the wait was going to be over 2 hours.  Ambiance is noisy and crowded. Tables are too close to each other. I guess next time we will try the take-out window only."}
{"text":"If you can get a spot at the bar, do it!  Great cocktails and the tacos are delicious!  My fav is the Hamberguesa burger.  A must try!"}
{"text":"Went with my son to introduce him to roast octopus tacos, and there weren't any on the menu anymore! Sad elephant! We consoled ourselves the best we could with a tasting flight of mescal and also discovered a new lovely beer. Food was still great and the atmosphere lively as expected. A little hard to hear the explanation of the mescal qualities but enjoyed it anyway. Will return when the octopus does..."}
{"text":"So may great things to say! I sat at the bar alone and Sam the bartender took care of me. She's funny, pretty and makes a mean cocktail! She also was working harder than almost anyone in the place...at least as hard as the kitchen guys! All the staff were busting their butts though and the manager seemed to be everywhere. Well run joint overall.   The food...I had the carrots. Unbelievably good. Flame roasted, caramelized, charred, sweet and savoury. I would go back just for those. I pretty much never thought carrots would be the highlight of any meal for me but they certainly were here. Then I had all four meat tacos...chicken, carnitas, tongue and...hmmm. Forget. Chorizo? Anyways, all of the meat tacos and they were superb. Also, after Sam's description of the salsa negra, I paid a little more and ordered it. It's basically salsa but all the ingredients are fire roasted first. GET IT.    Another big tip...order the doughnut!!! Order it early if you have to and have them put it aside. Hand to God: this is the best doughnut I've ever had. I got the last one and got heckled. I then shared a bit of it and got a free shot   I will be eating here every time I'm in Calgary. I stay at the Marriott next door too which makes it awesomely convenient."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was amazing! You have to try the donut holes - so yummy!! Sadly, the plates are quite small for the price you pay. Really cool looking space."}
{"text":"Excellent all around!  Came here on a co-worker's recommendation. About ten of us were in Calgary for training and came here for supper. It was busy so we had a bit of a wait to seat 10 people, but were offered drinks in the vestibule, which was great. Also great? It just happened to be Margarita Monday. Anyway, super cool atmosphere. Neat, different menu items. I shared the braised lamb neck and it was delicious! The salsa sampler is also a must-order. Really good food, really good drinks, and a really good place to come as a group."}
{"text":"Great place - we went this week for tacos on Tuesday! They had a great variety and the price was very reasonable. I think on other nights it can be fairly expensive though. Would likely go back on a Tuesday! Also the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Like all great places in Calgary, this one gets BUSY! Even with resos, we were seated at a bench by the window. Not ideal but it was better than nothing.   We knew what we were here for - tacos! So we rattled off a variety of ones we'd like to try (carnitas, lengua, pollo, frijoles & hongos) and chatted away.  They don't mess around here - variety of different salsas accompanied of tray of deliciousness and the tacos were made with fresh and simple ingredients. Had we had a proper table (and more time) I would have loved to try the pork belly tacas al carbon which is family style (next time, I swear!)  I can't find anyone that doesn't love this place, which means I won't have troubles finding someone to join me when I head back :)"}
{"text":"I have only had brunch here,but it is my favourite place to go for Sunday brunch! I can't get enough of their Rancho Huevos. Great service, relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food here is super yummy-- definitely a place to go for a treat! I had the taquitos,  bean and cheese tostadas and tacos. All of it was delicious. And I highly recommend the tres leches  cake for dessert. The service was great, but (my only complaint) it's  pricey for the amount of food you receive."}
{"text":"I have never believed that Mexican food could ever be so tasty. I am so stunned with all the flavours and the atmosphere that surround this restaurant. I will absolutely be coming back soon for even more great food."}
{"text":"My mouth is drooling just thinking about the tacos from here. I came here with friends to check out taco Tuesday's and was just say I'll definitely be back again (soon I hope). Nothing beats $2.50 tacos! We decided to try them all. My favorites were the beef tongue, carnitas, chorizo and hongos. The chicken ones were my least favorite because they were on the bland side. The frijoles had a nice smoky flavor but I'd rather have the meat ones over beans. The donut for dessert was bigger than I expected and was on the sweet side. The tres leche cake was soaked in horchata but I prefer the kind soaked in condensed and evaporated milk. The place is very lively and loud. The bar stool seats are not that comfortable either. I wouldn't say the place is very kid friendly but they do have 2 high chairs which is a bonus. I can't wait to return for taco Tuesday's!"}
{"text":"I don't know what is better:service or food. Both were outta this world amazing. I've been here twice once for tacos and another for brunch. If I had a tapeworm and sugar daddy I'd be here everyday. Wait staff love their job and it shows. Super friendly and very knowledgeable. Kitchen staff also love their job and IT shows. Seriously can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"Great Tacos, nice atmosphere, tacos are kinda overpriced considering the quantity, but the quality of the tacos are great. Definitely recommend trying the beef tongue tacos"}
{"text":"Loved the food.A crowded place. Since no reservation it was a long wait. Had to wait close to an hour T.he server was nice and helped us with the menu since it was our first time at the restaurant.  My favourite were the refried beans and the mushroom tacos.  They were amazing .The quantity was less for the price."}
{"text":"great place anytime fresh food.  great staff..if you in the neighborhood for tacos or other Mexican delights."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Native Tongues in spite of some issues.  The Mescal list alone is enough to guarantee a good time. Native Tongues kitchen is authentic.  Don't expect Anglo influenced Mexican food.  Our brisket and pork belly tacos were fab. Guacamole is fresh and everything tastes good.  Service is professional and fun, making your dining experience a good time. The one caveat is the size of the tables.  They are just too small for comfort.  This is food meant to be shared, and the tables make this very difficult.  However, that will not stop me from returning to Native Tongues."}
{"text":"Worst costumer service ever. I used to love and recommend this place to everyone that asked me about a good authentic Mexican restaurant NOT ANYMORE. The hostess was super rude to  us. You guys should be careful of who you have greeting people."}
{"text":"Good food.  Tacos were tasty and the salas were fresh.  Friendly staff.  Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Go for taco Tuesday- expect a wait but it is worth it! Tacos are amazing , guacamole is so tasty and they make the best margaritas!  Great vibe & good music!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience, excellent food and amazing service. The hamburguesas al carbon (charbroiled hamburguers) are authentic and delicious. Best in Calgary in my opinion. Carnitas tacos also very tasty.  Totally recommended!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican so I have been dying to try this place out. One of our close friends furnished a lot of the cool decor. Went in was a little crowded but if you don't want to be near people stay home. Good energy great meal and good service. Would have been five stars except service was a little slow ( however we went during busy hours ). This is on my list of return visits when I have a Mexican hankering."}
{"text":"The ambience, decor, and patronage of this establishment is worthy of a sweet taqueria on the West side of Los Angeles. The food is great and the service is very welcoming. This place is rad. Native Tongues is one of my favourite go-to's for dinner out!"}
{"text":"Don't tell anyone but this place is good!  Shiitake mushroom tacos you say?  Never heard of it.  But wow, what flavour!  They have a patio.  They specialize in mini tacos that are 2 or 3 bites but are quite tasty.  You need at least 5 to fill you up.  And if that is not enough you can have a donut for desert.  Fully licensed.  Nice eclectic decor inside.  Very popular place so reservations recommended."}
{"text":"Two of us had lunch, and it was a mixed bag.  I ordered tacos.  They are $3.95 each, so I ordered 2.  The server told me that they were small - 2 or 3 bites, and suggested that I order more.  I doubled my order to 4 tacos - $16.  They arrived on a small plate, with green and red hot sauce on the side.  No sides are included.  The tacos were essentially a small portion of meat in a small tortilla.  The size was similar to what you would see a waiting walking around with at a cocktail party.  The server also put in the wrong order for the other person, who ordered the special.  As a result, the tacos arrived and a good 15-20 minutes went by before the special arrived.  This is not the service level you expect from a restaurant with premium pricing.  At this point, a 1 star rating would have been fair.  When the special arrived it was well presented, and quite tasty.  It was a take on chicken and waffles that had a chicken breast in adobe sauce with two \"Timbit\" style donuts.  At $14, it was appropriately priced.   I must say that the restaurant realized their service issue and worked to mitigate it.  When the special arrived, they brought two complimentary tacos so that one person would not have to eat alone.  Additionally, they took the price of the special off the bill without being asked.  They deserve full marks for that.  I have eaten in Mexico, and more recently in Tucson where there are many fine Mexican restaurants.  Simply put, Native Tongues is not a true Mexican restaurant.  Rather, it seems Mexican..ish.  That does not mean that many will not enjoy it, but if you seek Mexican food keep looking. - See additional comments below.  Within 24 hours of writing this review I was contacted by the owner Cody Willis, which I appreciate.  Mr. Willis let me know that the taco price was being lowered to $3.50 to provide better value.  As well, he explained that (1) the Chef is from Mexico City, and (2) the restaurant provides traditional Mexican dishes, as well as some other \"fun and interesting\" dishes.  Fair enough, and an interesting approach that deserves additional consideration.  I must say that the commitment to customer service throughout, including quick follow-up from the owner, is amazing in a time when customer service seems to be a bygone consideration. Well done!  I will stand gladly corrected, and look forward to another visit."}
{"text":"I like the vibe here. Rustic interior. Lots of great spirits. Lots of whiskeys  The food was great   Corn 3.5/5 Single tacos 3/5 Chocolate dessert 5/5"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. I love this place! I've been here twice now for tacos, margaritas, and the best donut in all the land. The venue is always packed, because the menu is wonderfully delicious, so be prepared to wait in line. Once you get in, service is fast so you'll quickly forget you had to wait to be seated. Decor is hip with modern and traditional Mexican flair, giving this place a really cool vibe. The prices are a bit wonky -- tacos are reasonable, but the chips & guac is $14 which seems absurd. Cocktails and beer are normal prices, but I suggest going when margaritas are on special. Take-out window at the front means you can pre-order dinner (or just a donut) and pick-up to avoid the foray, but I recommend hanging out at least once just because Native Tongues is such a great spot. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food. Service can be super slow & they often mess up the order. Still worth it. Yummmm!"}
{"text":"Mexican food has been my nemesis since moving to Calgary. I find most of it over priced and just meh.   Well, Native Tongues is definitely not meh tho some of its menu items are a tad over priced. Given the lack of great alternatives, I'll pay.   My faves include the Chilaquiles, Gambas Carbon (tho they are a pain to eat) and the Hongos taco. I did try the much acclaimed donut. It was good but not worthy of the accolades in my opinion.   All in all, GO. EAT ALL THE TACOS."}
{"text":"My companion and I left with the impression that this is more of a bar then a place to eat. The tacos were fine, but far too small and certainly not as good as genuine Mexican tacos - just okay. The tortillas were way too small. If one was drinking and wanting a snack then I can imagine this might be a fit. Perhaps it is a matter of expectations and personal taste. I can understand why some might like this place. There was an extra charge for the salsa verde. In Mexico they do not charge extra for salsa verde. The non alcoholic drinks were pricey -$4.00. The nickel and diming adds up. The service was good and the ambience was very nice. I am reluctantly giving 3 stars, but 2 and a 1/2 is about right for me."}
{"text":"Mmm tacoooos! I had a great meal here my first night in Calgary. The interior is funky and hipster-chic - I liked it! The kitchen is open and I loved being able to watch the food being cooked over the coals - it's a really unique experience.  We had the guac, and cactus for appies - the guac was delicious, and the cactus was even better! The tacos I had were all very flavourful, although did need a little extra help with the spice (I didn't love their \"hot\" sauces, but that's personal preference.)  Food is expensive, and drinks are even more so ($40 for a pitcher of Margaritas that filled 4.5 glasses half full? Eek!) But they are all delicious, so if you've got the scrilla, take a visit!"}
{"text":"The greatest Mexican food of my life- the tacos were flavorful, authentic and delicious, and the food came out really quickly! Even though we weren't able to make a reservation, we were seated quickly. Probably my favorite restaurant in Calgary now!"}
{"text":"Love this little taco joint. Another classic from bmex group that will surely do a dent in my bank statement and not because of the prices but because of the amount I eat there!"}
{"text":"A most excellent bistro.  The quality of the food was exceeded by the outstanding service, all the the way through my experience.  Recommendations for wine and appetizers and, later, for the main course, we're perfectly on point.  The empanada and ceviche were both true to style and a pleasant segue to the presentation of tacos al pastor.  Consider the mushroom option, as it is the very best I have experienced, but do not bypass the beef and chicken options.  A small but well-rounded wine menu completed the meal brilliantly."}
{"text":"Definitely the best lunch I've had all year, possibly even in the last five years. Very welcoming staff, specially our amazing thin tattooed waiter who showed genuine interest in our lives and by the time lunch is finished an hour later we knew a lot of each other's life and travel history. He grew up in Victoria BC one of my favorite cities in the world and just moved here from Montreal. We are just moving soon to Calgary from Toronto. What a welcome change. What a amazing environment in this place. The photos don't even do it justice, especially because Mexican food doesn't really photograph that well, doesn't really look that appetizing, but I read a bunch of yelp reviews ahead of time and everybody recommended the lamb neck which I've never tried, I've had lamb so fresh that it was literally on a 2000 acres sheep farm in New Zealand, but this lamb was absolutely spectacular. My sons loved the empanadas and tacos as well. The appetizer was a variety of about six different salsasWith fresh made chips made in house just out of the fryer. The guacamole was amazing and the traditional sauce that was OK but not spicy enough for me, they had warned us that the spiciest salsa was the one that was green with lots of sesame seeds but actually I found it not spicy, but the best of all the salsas by far is the one that looks least appetizing, it's made with a variety of six different braised Chili's and crushed peanuts and a dark red oil. Who would ever call that a salsa? It was absolutely spectacular and my kids and I devoured it, it gave you three different levels of heat, the first feeling on the front of your tongue and then spicier on the back of your tongue, and then later after you swallow it has the most delicious aftertaste full of heat and spice, but just the right amount not too much. Plus the crunchiness of the peanuts of course is amazing. It was really something else like I've never tried. And check out the photos of this amazing coal fired stove, they do all the cooking somehow on this thing, with the wheels raising and lowering the platform that all the food is on, how complicated and difficult must that be for the amazing chef. Kudos! Thank you so much everybody we loved it."}
{"text":"4 stars only because I have not tried the whole menu and the jarritos are over priced. The tacos are  great. My favorites are the chorizo and mushroom tacos. Also try the different types of salsa and guacamole. Hands down the best mexican restaurant in Calgary"}
{"text":"Neat place. Food was great but unfortunately, we came around 6:30 pm and the wait was ridiculous! They don't take reservations either!"}
{"text":"I heard so many things about this place from people and social media that I needed to try it out!   Made a reso with some colleagues and we went for lunch one day... It wasn't impressive.  I LOVE tacos, I mean who doesn't? but I found these to be kind of boring and lack of any real excitement. The drink menu I thought would have more fun varieties of margs, but I don't remember there being that many.  The decor is cool inside so I'd like to give this place another shot, maybe for dinner and maybe try something aside from tacos."}
{"text":"First Mexican cuisine I'd ever had that didn't involve a drive through or a chihuahua as a promotional character. The different types of tacos and sauces, well damn that was delicious. People who know me even a little know I am not fond of trying new things. This was one of those times where I am happy I tagged along and tried something new. Luckily for me it was expletive delicious. If you are on the fence, you should go. If you're thinking, \"maybe I'll just go to Taco Time(don't get me started on Taco Time)\" DON'T! Put on your adventure pants and head out to Native Tongues. The staff were friendly and more than willing to help with menu choices. The vibe in the place is just brilliant. Now I'm rambling, you cats get the point."}
{"text":"The tacos and margaritas are out of this world good. I'm not a huge fan of the communal tables...I prefer to dine a bit more privately.  The vibe is definitely not Mexican like i expected, but very hipster, man-buns as far as the eye can see!  I wish there was an outdoor patio. I went during happy hour, but otherwise the prices would have been steep. Honestly though you won't get a taco that even compares to this anywhere else in the city!"}
{"text":"Great Sunday night spot that's open late.  Native Tongues has a chilled out environment, light and tasty tacos, and well mixed manhattans.  Thumbs up for sure."}
{"text":"It's really hard to find a good taqueria and I thought this would be it. It was alright. I went during happy hour for the 5$ margarita - great and totally hit the spot. Same with the chilaquiles, which were 6$.   The tacos I ordered were suadero, carnitas, and chorizo con papas. All of the meat had a weird texture, like it was too fine that it left a gritty fibrous texture in my mouth. Seasoning was okay - too much paprika or chipotle seasoning. The tortilla and salsas were nice.   Service was good. The server stopped in to fill water and asked how the food was, though didn't ask if I'd like another margarita now that of think of it. Likely it was because there was a huge group he was trying to serve as well.   Overall, worth a try. If all else fails, the margaritas fit the bill."}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place so I wanted to check it out. I wanted to love it... but I thought it was just okay. I generally looove Mexican food, especially guacamole... but I have to say I was pretty disappointed by their guacamole. Their chips were good though. My husband got an assortment of tacos and I got a bean and cheese toasada... we were both just very underwhelmed. Their decor is very trendy and our server was great. The food was just meh. It wouldn't be my first choice to come back there."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try Native Tongues since I heard it was being built about a year ago. Finally got the chance to eat there for a biz lunch this week. We ordered the chips & guacamole to start. Good portion for an app, and both the chips and guac were super fresh. The guacamole itself was nice and simple. A little hit of lime, a little salt and some thinly sliced hot peppers throughout. For the main we split the Lamb Neck Tacos served family style. I was impressed with the amount of meat we received, still on the bone in a bowl of juices. Tortillas were fresh and strong, and were accompanied by fresh diced onion, salsa verde, salsa rojo, some pickled onion and a charred pepper. All of which were very tasty and made for great tacos.  My only complaint about the joint was that the table napkins left a rather embarrassing amount of white lint stuck to my black jeans and my dining companion's black tights. A small role to pay for a really good lunch."}
{"text":"Still my favourite Mexican place in Calgary. As a Mexican and a certified chef I can assure this is the real deal.  You have to try the corn, tuna tostada, bean soup and for the tacos my go to is carnitas which is pork but the Hongos and suadero are delicious too.  If you have some room left get a doughnut, it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Man that was good. So darn good. No wonder this place is nearly impossible to get into earlier in the evening. My to-go: Esquites: Epazote braised corn, mayonesa, queso, onion, cilantro, chile. Taco Lengua: Beef tongue, white onion, cilantro. Taco Carnitas: Confit pork, white onion, cilantro. Taco Hongos: Locally cultivated mushrooms, kale, cream, queso fresco, cilantro. And they gave me a little treat, because I had to wait for a clean spot at the bar: DONAS!: Original glazed donuts, made in house daily. The best tacos I've had in quite a while. The Esquites was bright and refreshing. And the donut lived up to the reviews. That's a good donut. Also a huge shout out to my fantastic bartender. Welcoming, engaging, personable. He made me feel right at home. I knew I wanted Mezcal, but not how I wanted it. He asked if I wanted a shot, or a mixed drink. I wanted a mixed drink, so he asked what flavor profile I was looking for. After settling on a citrusy mixed drink, he made a fantastic drink I've never had before.  So happy I stopped in. I definitely recommend stopping in."}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere, mediocre service.   There was more employees than customers when we went in, but service was a slow, awkward crawl.   Got the guac dip and all the tacos on the menu. Overall, the food was tasty and quick to come out.   Unfortunately our experience was dampened by the poor service from the server and bar star. Made for an awkward experience which almost overshadowed the great food.   Good spot for groups looking for a non-dive bar for good eats and drink options. Cocktails and beer was a little on the pricey end in my opinion, food as well, but easier to accept the cost of the food, not so much for the expensive small cans of mediocre craft beer."}
{"text":"The combination of the trio of tacos and the beer special was so perfect.  The guacamole and chips were a perfect crunchy, creamy beginning to get the tastebuds ready for the beautiful Tacos. The staff were all so smiley and nice it really seemed as though everyone was happy to be there. The decor and music added to the charm and ambiance of the restaurant.  I had a great experience."}
{"text":"The food was very good and the mescaritas were delicious.  On those alone I would give it 4.5 stars.  What I didn't like was the noise level and the prices.   We had a hard time have a conversation and the place was only half full.  This place is very good but expensive.  $14 for taco chips and some gauc?  $3.50 for a very tiny taco.  Not sure how they claim to be a two $$ place.  Sure the tacos are $3.50 each but you would need at least 5 to feel semi full."}
{"text":"Oh damn... you have to eat here.  It's a bit loud and crowded, but the tacos!!  Sweet Jesus.  don't skip dessert!"}
{"text":"Food was great.  Busy spot and we didn't take reservations.  We had to wait about 40 min on a Thursday night so went to the pub next door.  Our food was delicious but thought it was quite overpriced.  We had guacamole and tacos.  Great Mexican but don't expect Mexican prices."}
{"text":"This place is stunningly popular. We had to wait 15 mins for a table on the Sunday evening of the Lilac Festival...maybe that's just fine.   The atmosphere is lovely. Great music, great vibe, great wait staff, great everyone.   The menu is wonderful, Mexican food done well, really well. We had the (forgive the translations) grill corn and the soup to start. We were both in heaven.   Margarita was tasty and well done. Squirt (Mexican version of Ting) was great.   Fish tacos for 2, refried bean and mushroom tacos all amazing, tasty, fresh and well prepared. Cooked right there in view over open coals by cheerful chefs. Well run and very timely even whilst being super busy.   Finished with Mexican flan. Wow.   Reasonable well priced. $80 for two even with desert, starter and margaritas. I'll recommend highly. Why can't this restaurant be in Toronto? Shout out to Kelsi the wait staff...cool, charming under pressure."}
{"text":"tacos come in all shapes and sizes. some have hard shells and some have soft. You can put whatever you want in a taco, very much like a sandwich. Guacamole goes nice with tacos"}
{"text":"Good shaken Margaritas!! The share concept food is good as you can have food keep coming. The portions are small, order a few if you are really hungry"}
{"text":"Just drove all the way downtown for dinner to find out they are closed for a private function we tried calling earlier to book a reservation but they have an automated message saying they don't take reservations would have been neat if they said they had a private function"}
{"text":"I know this restaurant is amazing and has a great reputation in town .. but I have yet to have a super enjoyable experience. Stopped in with 4 girlfriends the first time and our appetizer of shrimp was not cooked fully and the server was quite rude about it, although it was clearly not prepared properly. The second time I came, on a Monday, the wait was atleast 75 minutes, so I didn't get to give it another shot. The donuts were probably my favourite part - I would go back for those."}
{"text":"This place has a buzzy dynamic ambience that one craves for fun night out with friends. And the food served is quite authentic.  A must go for anyone in mood for Mexican :)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I've got to say that it's solid! The meats are lovingly prepared, the presentation is non pretentious and simple, and the service is excellent. They have a Taco Tuesday special where you can go and satisfy your craving on the cheap, so I don't know what other reasons you have for not going. lol."}
{"text":"The best tacos hands down in the city. Especially the lengua when it's on special. Save room for the donas!!! That donut is to die for."}
{"text":"Roast Beast calls to me, as if part of my native tongue. Anytime I see it on a menu or in photos I salivate. There's something so satisfying about enjoying meat that has been cooked for hours to develop deep, rich complex flavors and the caramelized (not burnt) char that's unmistakable. Add in the primal feeling you get when you pull meat from a bone, and the satisfaction of knowing you're consuming a cut that harkens back to the olden days when food wasn't perfectly packaged for us often at the grocery store, and you've got a memorable meal.   That's exactly my experience at Native Tongue, a bastion of homestyle Mexican eats in a city with little to no Mexican population. Looking at the menu, there's evidence the ownership took the time to explore what most don't know about Mexican cuisine, and that's extremely exciting.  I spotted the Barbacoa al Carbon on the menu and knew I needed it in my belly. Al Carbon is over-charcoal and Native Tongue has a gorgeous coal fired oven smack dab in the middle of their open kitchen. If you peek at it you'll see two wheels used to raise and lower the cooking surface as a means to control the fire. They finish quite a few of the dishes over this fire adding that roasty, smoky, charred character to veg and proteins all over the menu.  The Barbacoa is a slow roasted lamb neck seared over the fire and then cooked for hours and hours in a deep, dark, chili infused stock until totally tender. It arrives looking imposing, but with the fork and spoon provided, it easily comes away from the bone to soak in the bowl of broth beneath. It's served with warm corn tortillas, salsa roja, avocado, lime and fire roasted Anaheim chilis. You build your own tacos, and they seem to get better as the meal goes on.  We also enjoyed two antojitos, zanahorias or en ingles, fire roasted British Colombia carrots topped with a Serrano beurre blanc and queso fresco; and the Hongos, pasilla and lime brined locally cultivated mushrooms (we got the whole story on where they're from), served with fire roasted butternut squash (calabaza) a few escabeche pickles and micro radish. Both fantastic starters.  To round it out, don't skip the cocktails or mezcal list. Ask for Charlotte if you want to learn a few things about this amazingly diverse spirit. Their collection is freaking rad!! We enjoyed their take on an old fashioned made with brandy, mezcal, and a few other ingredients, served with a dried chili garnish. Smoky, sweet, way too easy to drink, and very fun.   At the end of the meal they told us about Two Penny, a new Chinese inspired restaurant they're opening around the corner, and from the sounds of it, they've taken the same care to understand the culture and food, and this will surely be a winner too.  To the owners, get in touch. We need you stateside, starting in Nevada."}
{"text":"Had a delicious authentic Mexican lunch The guacamole was excellent the chips perfectly crisp and not greasy The mushroom, brisket and snapper tacos light fresh and very well seasoned m. Everything was wonderful excellent service from Olivia A memorable experience for us foody Californians."}
{"text":"Great place and good service.  This place can get really busy so try to go early.  Taco tuesday $2.50 all day, delicious and variety of different choices.  Fresh Guacamole is a must and the grilled octopus dish is tasty.  Great for get together with friends or date night."}
{"text":"This place has amazing tacos on corn flour tortillas where the corn is sourced straight from Mexico! The lamb neck sauce is my favorite and their warm corn is the most delicious side I've ever had! They also have glazed donuts made in-house if you have room for dessert. They play dope hip hop which I like. Communal tables are common here. Service is great!"}
{"text":"I really liked the decor and atmosphere of this place but that's about it. The drinks and tacos were very very average and quite frankly something that you could easily make at home yourself."}
{"text":"Great tacos decent prices great doughnut super friendly staff and great atmosphere/decor."}
{"text":"The flavours are absolutely outstanding! Although the prices are inflated, my husband and I both agree the food is worth it for a little splurge.  The atmosphere is fun, and staff if friendly and knowledgable about their menu.  Great food, great service. We will go back for sure."}
{"text":"While visiting Calgary, some people that I have met mentioned the mexican food in Canada does not compare to California. Not that I was doubting him, I needed to try out tacos in Canada to see what this person was talking about. Native Tongues Taqueria was close by the place I stayed at. It was open late and very convenient. I can agree that the tacos were not too impressive, but at most was not impressed with the price per tacos.   VERDICT: One and done."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town especially during happy hour when they become reasonably priced. Drinks are great too. Only complaint is the long waitlists and no reservation policy which make this an inconvenient place to visit."}
{"text":"don't understand what's the hype about this place. Drinks are ridiculously expensive $13 for a small margarita? I had three tacos they came kind of cold and very small $3.95 each. I'm a small girl and had to order something else as it was not enough for me. Basically, the food is average at best and not worth the money."}
{"text":"This place has good food- tastes fresh-you know they've made it today and are not letting it sit around.  The only downside is I found it quite expensive so I wouldn't personally frequent it too often."}
{"text":"I am a bit surprised to be writing a 3-star review for this place, but the TLDR version is that the food is way overpriced and is only slightly above average in my opinion. For context, I am a native Californian, so I have had more than my fair share of Mexican food (as well as throughout the southwest).   Food: The food is okay, slightly above average in my opinion. We got chips and guac for the table and then between seven people, tried all six of the tacos. The chips were solid, well-built, perhaps overly salty at times (it's not good when you have residual salt grains on your hands after picking up a chip). The guac was okay. Bit on the smoother side in terms of texture; also they dumped cilantro and serrano peppers on top, which is (a) unusual and (b) not helpful for people with that gene that makes cilantro taste really bad. Fairly small portion all things considered - maybe two medium-large avocados? The tacos are small; you could eat it in one bite. Some of the smallest I've had. The only other time I ate a taco that I could potentially eat in one bite cost me about 15% of what these cost me and were just as good. The food is fresh, no doubt about that, and the corn tortillas are good. But there's just no special factor that takes these tacos over the top (or that justifies the price). The flavors, if anything, are a bit underwhelming for Mexican food, and there's not much depth to the overall element. I tried the suadero, the carnitas, the chorizo y papas, and the pollo adobo. Of these, I found the suadero to be the best (read: the least worst) and the chorizo y papas to be the worst. Nothing tasted abjectly bad, but everything was way underflavoured. Chorizo is supposed to be a very potent flavor with a depth profile that's hard to match without making something unbearable spicy. But this could almost have passed for some breakfast sausage. Carnitas were a bit dry; chicken was whatever. Pickled onions on the pollo adobo barely had any acidity. In general, the food does not scream authentic Mexican to me. It screams westernized, slightly hipster Mexican.   Price: This is where stars are lost. $15 for chips and guac? No way. I know that avocados are not exactly a dime a dozen, but that guac of that size should not have been more than $6, and the chips shouldn't have been more than $4. For reference, it was an okay amount for seven people, but definitely we could have eaten more, and it would be appropriate for 4+. Each taco was $3.50, which is approaching the upper limit of the most that I've ever paid for any taco. Usually I don't pay more than $1.00 to be honest. On the rare occasion that I do pay that much, the tacos have been amazing. These are not amazing. They are passable, good at best, and underwhelming at worst.   Service: The most attentive they were was to our water cups, which were refilled by them, even though they provided two pitchers, once the cup dropped by more than a third in volume.  We did ask for some time at the start, but that doesn't mean that we needed 20 minutes, and it took about 10 to get the bill after we asked for it. Nice guy, but not timely at all."}
{"text":"It is my first night in Calgary and I feel like the luckiest person in the city. I'm staying at the Fairfield Inn and suites and the front desk person suggested that I eat at Native Tongues.   I arrived in Calgary a day earlier than all of my friends and so I've had the afternoon and evening to do my own thing. I sat down at the bar and the experience from then on was nothing short of amazing. The bartender, I didn't get her name, was so incredibly knowledgeable about all of their beverages as well as their entire menu. We, through her questioning, basically made choices together throughout the evening and everything that we chose was amazing.  She was so attentive and was constantly praising me for my adventurous drink and menu choices.  Corn in a cup-the perfect start.  Beef tongue? I know, I was hesitant too, but it was awesome.  Pork which is often a staple in Mexican food was succulent.  This was an amazing dining experience.  I feel bad saying this, but, the chairs are just not comfortable. No reservations, so get in early.  I was there at 5:30 and by 6 every table was packed.   I think I had tried a different dishes by the time the evening ended and not one of them failed to excite my palette.  WELL DONE!"}
{"text":"Hmmm I don't know, everything was really good but I guess that because I'm Mexican that Makes really hard to meet my expectations of good Mexican food! But over all is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Canada ( I have just been in Calgary Montreal and Ottawa) the atmosphere is really Mexican de decorations is really nice they don't make look Mexico like just a cheep cheese culture. I almost cried when I so all the tequilas and mezcales that they have which is really important in a Mexican restaurant! My only inconvenient the food was not really hot I'm sure it was just a mistake!"}
{"text":"Affordable, fun, hip, tasty dining!   You probably would not think of ordering a burger here, but the hamburguesa is so darn delish - do it!!!  I love all of the tacos, the chorizo are my favorite but I always order a variety.   I have had a few off seafood dishes here so I now avoid ordering ceviche and wish they only had fish on their menu when it was super fresh as a special.   Note to the owners and bartender - please bring back the Word Play cocktail, it is beloved by so many of my friends and me! Until then the margaritas are an OK substitute :)"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with a friend and absolutely loved it. Good authentic Mexican food. Reminded us of the food we ate in the Mexican village.   Taco Tuesday is amazing as well. Loved the different variety of Taco. Must try the beef tongue, pulled pork and mushroom for those who eat mushroom."}
{"text":"They have very unique menu dishes here. The cow tongue taco, is really tasty, and well thought out   I was scepticale on their donuts, but its probably  tyhe best one ive ever had"}
{"text":"We ordered the elotes, chilaquiles and 6 tacos (chicken, beef tongue, chorizo, 2 pork, hongos). Reasonable portion size as it was 2 petite girls able to eat all the food that we ordered.  Out of the 6 tacos we had (3 for me and 3 for my friend), both my friend and I enjoyed the pork confit taco the most! Flavourful, juicy and just the right amount of saltiness. I thought the chicken taco was a bit dry and probably would not order it again.   They have a large selection of drinks but are overpriced. The day we went there was a sangria promotion (originally $14), but even with the promotion we felt a glass of sangria for the price is not worth it.  Service was great, our waiter always coming back to refill our water and the place is cute with an open kitchen"}
{"text":"Based on reviews etc we were stoked to eat at NT. I ordered one of each taco to get a good sense of what this place was all about. I enjoyed the beef taco and thought the mushroom taco was flavoured very nicely (despite hating the rubbery texture) but aside from that the tacos were overall pretty mediocre. One very important thing to note is that despite our server visiting us to ask how things were and multiple other servers dropping off food and filling water not one of them noticed we were missing the assortment of salsas/sauces that typically come with orders of tacos. All three of us ended up eating our meals \"dry\" and no one was observant enough to catch that pretty critical part of the meal. We didn't even realize we were missing anything. Also the cocktails were pretty unusual...not in a good way."}
{"text":"There was a time where I was going to Native Tongues every week. This place is awesome and authentic. Never had a meal that disappointed. Keep up the great work.   #Horchatalove"}
{"text":"This place will always be my favorite Mexican food. I can literally eat there every day."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner on Saturday. It was busy so they took our phone number and put our name on the wait list. Our table was ready within the 40 minutes they promised. The issue is that their grill was broken and they could only provide their limited late night menu. It would have been nice if they had told us about the problem when we first arrived. Chances of getting in anywhere else without another hour wait was not at all likely so we stayed. No apology for the inconvenience, no offer to buy us a drink or an appy, just an arrogant 'do you still want the table?' As for the food, the black bean tostada was amazing. The chips and guacamole were just bad, bland guac and enough salt on the chips to salinate a salt water aquarium. The tacos were average at best. The desert was really good. Our server was great, saved the restaurant from getting one star."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos here! And the staff are great, they are super friendly and personal. Even when our 1 year old started getting a little fussy one of the ladies came over to entertain him and he loved it! Their cold coffee is definitely worth trying as well!"}
{"text":"Delicious all the way around! This was next door to our hotel so we gave it a shot and were not the least bit disappointed... Chips and salsa taster was great. The corn appetizer was unique and delish! Shared a hamburger that came with chips and hot sauce drizzle and the 'Girl with the mask' cocktail was awesome! If ever back in Calgary, we'd go back!!"}
{"text":"Best mexican food ever. The rice was spiced really well and the refriend beans were tasty. Delicious"}
{"text":"Great food and service. My new favourite eating spot . Pretty authentic Mexican food , fresh and creative."}
{"text":"The best tacos I've ever had. Friendly staff and great ambiance! We wanted a place with good food and a full bar and we found it."}
{"text":"Great cocktails and food. We had the lamb tacos. Incredibly tender. This place fills up, but it's definitely worth the wait. A great place for a date."}
{"text":"Came on a Tuesday to take advantage of their $2.50 taco specials! I was already warned beforehand that the tacos are fairly small... and they are.  Each one is good for about three bites but are filled with flavorful ingredients.  My group and I tried everything and my personal favorites were the beef tongue, carnitas (pork) and hongos (mushrooms).  I'm glad we got to try them at the special price because I don't think they're worth $3.95 each.  We also had the glazed donut (too sweet) and tres leches (did not like that it was soaked in horchata as opposed to milk) as our desserts.    Overall good food but fairly pricey, and my Mexican coworkers say they're probably the closest to authentic Mexican cuisine in Calgary."}
{"text":"Hey guys, food is great, playlist is always on point, but please change the napkins to a different fabric that doesn't leave lint and random threads on clothing, especially dark pants/jeans.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"It's hipster taco time! But, like, not in the ironic way that regular Taco Time is also hipster taco time... We're talking done up to the nines in rustic fashion here - Native Tongues is super cool! The tacos are a slightly gourmet but still quite traditional taco, and coming in at the high $3 dollar range puts them pretty on par with the other authentic Mexican eats in town. Now what other authentic places in the city won't have is a chillaxed ambiance, good service, or a craft freakin' cocktail bar. Native tongues has all of this. It would be a cool place to go for cocktails and order some tacos on the side, or make a meal of it (making damn sure to order the corn queso. Yum!) and have some drinks on the side.  Because the food is so quick, Native Tongues would also be an excellent lunch pick. Excellent spot to take a lunch date or business lunch."}
{"text":"Great place, must have the civich√©! Awesome cocktails as well. I wouldn't recommend going with large groups, we enjoyed it more when we went with just two people."}
{"text":"We are here after our hiking adventures out on Banff and we're really craving tacos.  It was ok, but not as amazing as all the hype.  None of the tacos were life changing, but they were ok.  I've also had better seasoned and more tender taco meats....just a meh for me.  Cocktails were good so maybe just come here if you want sides and drinks."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Calgary- hands down. Food is superb, service is prompt and polite. Full bar with great unique cocktails. Location is walking distance and convenient to many other downtown bars and restaurants. Open late and a great relaxing environment inside. Prices are fair for quality of food. Hard to beat!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best food I have ever tasted!  Amazing flavors and creativity!  Come hungry, eat as many dishes as you can and save room for desert! The flan is unbelievable and the cold brew liquor amazing!  I did not give this a full 5 stars because 1) The restaurant charges for little extras like lime/lemon slices for water and extra bread/chips.  I think this is low class and the dish I asked for extra bread was a shared entree for four people that only came with three bread slices.  This restaurant is better than that and I hope they change this policy.  It will be reflected in bigger tips, I'm sure.  An approach like that makes the client hold it against the waiter, when it is not their fault.  2) The premise of the restaurant is shared dishes and the tables were very small so we felt rushed to eat and get serving dishes out of the way. 3) Very loud! Had to yell to  hear/be heard.   If the above negatives don't bother you, you will absolutely love this place!  And, if they make any changes to the above, there is no doubt this could be the best restaurant in Calgary!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now, and I've really enjoyed it.  Even on a Tuesday it was really busy, but we got a table quickly. The service is really friendly and a couple of minor mistakes were fixed quickly and without question.   The food was really flavourful and great for sharing. My least favourite thing that I ordered was the ceviche which was good and fresh but just not as good as others I've had. The tuna tostada was my favourite.  This is a fun, social place with good food - It just might become my go-to when I'm in town."}
{"text":"The flavors were very authentic and the place is hip and exciting. The mushroom tacos were the best tacos on the menu. We also got the Huevos Rancheros which was interesting and a nice brunch dish."}
{"text":"This is a lost treasure in Calgary. Highly recommended. Food and cocktails are unbelievable. Anthony Bourdain should pay a visit . Try anything in the menu and you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"These are not your boxed, Old El Paso tacos!  Native Tongues offers authentic tacos just outside Calgary's downtown core. With prices on a per-taco basis and small portion sizes, the menu is perfect for trying all the flavours available. On my first visit, the a la carte taco flavours included pork, chicken, chorizo, beef tongue, mushrooms, and refried beans.  For me, the highlights included the soft taco shells, tender beef tongue and light yet flavourful tomatillo salsa.  In addition to tacos for a main, I was very excited to see nopales on the appetizer list, being a cactus paddle with salsa and queso fresco. This was my first time having an opportunity to try cactus leaf and I was pleasantly surprised by the mild flavour enhanced by a char grilling.  At $3.95 per taco, I did find the prices a little high. I understand the restaurant participates in taco Tuesday, though, so when I go back I'll make a point to try to get in on this day."}
{"text":"If you live in Calgary and like Mexican food, you too have likely noticed that Calgary is not traditionally known as a town that boasts great Mexican cuisine. THAT IS UNTIL NOW. This eclectic, fun, hipster hidden gem is now a new staple for me. The menu is Tapas style and the tacos are about 3 bites per taco each. The chips and guacamole were stellar (well mostly the guac). My all time favorite taco is the pollo taco, however the carnito and the frijoles are close runner ups! This was my 3rd visit to Native tongues and I finally succumbed to the desert menu (primarily because I watched the cook take the donuts out and hand dip them in glaze. $5.00 was a bit steep for one glazed donut, however the savory dance my tastebuds were doing with every bite - made this a donut not to pass up! We will be back and I hope you all enjoy this place as much as I do!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Gorgeous design! Knowledgeable staff!  This place is great for a casual date, or to meet up with friends on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"So much love is packed into every taco. My personal favorite is their locally grown mushroom one with a savoury and subtly sweet flavour. They get extremely busy after 6pm and the wait for a larger party is definitely longer. I was in a party of five and we ended up waiting about an hour before we could get seated. Although it took us a while to get seated, our waitress did not take long to take our order and our food arrived quickly. Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I was in the city today running errands and my stomach finally started complaining, so I needed to find food fast! (Hangry anyone?) I remembered Native Tongues on my bookmarks and was in the area, so with a hop, skip and a jump I made my way to Native Tongues Taqueria.   I was greeted by a hostess who let me choose my seating (I was 1 person, so bonus!). I sat down at the bar and was greeted by the bartender/server. He was very friendly and gave me the food and drink menu to peruse as I drank some water. I decided to go for Hongos Tacos de Guisado (vegetarian for non native speakers, like me...) and the Esquites (a corn mix with feta, onion, mayo, cilntro, and lime). There are 6 different types of taco fillings that you can get, all for the same price ($3.95), most are meat based except for the Hongos (veggie) and Frijoles (refried beans). I would suggest trying a few different taco fillings for your first order, then if you feel the need, get some more if you are still hungry so you can at least explore some of the other flavours.   The tacos and esquites arrived a short 10 minutes later, and I did not waste any time either eating them! The tacos are only a few bites, I bought 3, and were in a warm corn tortilla, along with a side of green and red salsa. The corn came de cobbed in a little metal ramekin. The tacos primarily were mushroom based, the menu said kale was in them, but I didn't notice a lot, and a drizzle of cream on each one. They were really delicious! The corn tortilla really added to the flavour, and the mushrooms were nice and hardy. I put plenty of the red and green salsa on each one to add some 'oomph' to them. The corn was also tasty, although I would have liked a bigger flavour punch. The corn sweat that accumulated at the bottom (I swear it is tastier than I make it sound) was great as all the seasonings and flavour collected and you could mix it nicely with the remaining corn kernels.   After finishing my first course I decided that I was still a little empty and ordered Molletes (This is only available on the Brunch menu twice a week according to the server/bartender). Two pieces of grilled sour dough with refried beans, melted gouda cheese, seasoned diced tomatoes, cilantro and feta. Holy cow, what a delicious plate! I managed to eat both slices and totally revelled in the flavours! Highly recommend if you get a chance to go in on a weekend for brunch (11:30-3PM Sat/Sun). It is quite filling, so either use it as a starter for two people, or your meal with something smaller. I have to say the Molletes was my second favourite of the entire meal! My first...well I took home a freshly baked and glazed Dona (Translation: glazed donut). I ate this delicious guy on the way home in the car (totally was not driving and eating at all....okay I was). For those lucky Canadians who got their hands on a freshly made Krispi Kream donut way back before they got closed down cause they were so darn good (another lie, people realized they were really fatty and bad so stopped going to the stores, but aren't all good things?!). This donut is basically the equivalent, now there is a different taste to it, the best way I can describe it is that it has a Mexican twist, almost a slight corn taste, but sweet and heavenly. HIGHLY recommend getting one for dessert or to go for a nice evening treat after you have burned off your meal.   Overall a very tasty experience at Native Tongues! I would love to come back with some buddies to try more food and maybe some cocktails."}
{"text":"First off, just want to say I've never been a huge fan of Mexican food but damn this place is good. We ordered some individual tacos, and shared the family style pork belly tacos and the lamb neck tacos. The individual tacos are ok. Little expensive and was expecting a full piece of beef tongue meat rather than minced beef tongue.   The family style roasts are awesome! Great bang for your buck and the flavours are explosive. We also had the salsa/guac/sauce combo plate was a nice touch as well.   Service was also good. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great spot for tasty tacos and tostadas. The beef tacos in particular were delicious because of the char flavour and perfect ratio of meat, garnish, and soft corn taco. The green salsa was fresh and not vinegary, like too many restaurant salsas.  One of the liveliest spots in Calgary for a great meal."}
{"text":"Had the carrots on the starters menu, street tacos, old fashions  and a donut to finish it off! Amazing!  The staff was friendly, proficient, and on their game...great lyles back place to have great small plates and drinks"}
{"text":"This restaurant was not great for large groups for the following reasons: - no reservations are taken even on week days we had a hour wait when we got there at 7 on a Thursday  -  it is extremely loud in the restaurant and situated in long narrow tables - ordering is family style and all entrees are meant to be shared . This was a bit difficult as you had to carve a chicken to divvy up amongst 3 people  - they were out of one of the tacos   This would be a great date place but if you are a large group try it out a Monday or Tuesday."}
{"text":"Rad.  Every time.  They hire cool people.  Eat a donut. The mushroom tacos are the bomb."}
{"text":"This is a loud noisy bar with some small bites on the side.  I was expecting fast food and at 4$ a taco its not worth it.  Taco tuesdays was good we went woth 5 ppl and ordered 28 tacos and some chips and corn.  Expensive for \"cheap\"  mexican food.  I wont be returning or bringing guests.  Basically just meat and a tortillas.  Oh the guac was fresh and tasty just like at home but i throe in more spices and spur cream and makes it a proper dip.  Had to order sour creme on the side.  Waitress was on point and good"}
{"text":"Really happy with how the food in YYC is getting better and better! Native Tongue Taqueria is going on my list of great restaurants in Calgary :)   Lots of street parking literally right in front of the restaurant and down the street. I would visit on an evening or Sunday lunch if you want to save your parking money.   They hand you a paper menu where you can write down how many of each tacos you'd like. They have appies, salads, individual tacos, and then a big family sized plate where it comes with all the fixings and you can make your own tacos! It was difficult to choose as the individual and the family sized plates are different meats.   We started with the tuna ceviche which had a good kick and is served on one big chip with guac. The guac tasted really fresh and the tuna was delicious too. I wouldn't say it's a good sharing dish though because of how messy it was.   From the individual sized tacos, I liked the mushroom, cow tongue, pork and chorizo in that order. Beef tongue sounds really weird and I was hesitant to try but it was actually super good! So tender and flavourful!  We ordered the lamb tacos for the family sized one and it came with all the sides and 8 tortilla wraps. There was plenty of meat though, you could have made more tacos by ordering extra wraps.   The place looks like a pub and it is on the louder side. Good place to go to hang out with friends for some food and drinks! If you're looking for a good place for tacos, this is definitely the best place in Calgary! :D"}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. I would try their version of 'nachos' as well as their amazing home made donut!  The service was excellent - we sat at the bar so we could watch the action by the grill.  Truly an amazing experience.  Worth every penny."}
{"text":"After finding truly sensational ice cream at Village Ice Cream the last thing I expected to find in Calgary was tacos comparable to what I'm used to in Los Angeles - but that's exactly what I found at Native Tongues.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  Native Tongues was jam packed on a Sunday evening, but that didn't stop us from being seated immediately by one of the friendlier servers I can recall encountering in recent memory. She was wonderful, and complimented what was a fantastic and lively atmosphere. Star.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  Native Tongues charges $3.75 each for what are small tacos, and that's reasonable in my mind only because of a favorable USD exchange rate. For reference, my girlfriend and I split seven tacos and a donut between us and we're still pretty hungry at the end of the night. Star.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  Native Tongues offers a cool blend of traditional and contemporary street tacos, and while the classics like carnitas and asada were good, it was the contemporary offerings like the mushroom and black bean that were really exceptional. Single Star.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Native Tongues dishes up some seriously stellar tacos in a great atmosphere, and while they're pricey, it's worth your visit. Star."}
{"text":"Believe what you hear. There's a reason it's hard to get in on a Tuesday when their tacos are $2.50. Best tacos  I've had in Calgary. They come with two types of salsa; a green and a red. The red is not too spicy but has a fantastic  smokey tomato flavour. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the service was fantastic even for how busy it was. 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Best Tacos in Calgary. The end.  You need more? Alright.  Every taco is on another level from anything else you're going to find in Calgary. The carnitas is my go-to, but pick something with a flavour profile you like. If you like tacos in general, this is your spot, but I'm not going to pretend to know what flavours that tongue of yours prefers.  These are your authentic, small softshell tacos. You aren't going to find any hardshell-old-elpaso-make-your-own-taco-kit nonsense here.  The staff might be the highlight. Genuinely nice, personal people who make for great conversation. Sit at the bar, or a table, you'll have a great experience regardless.  The beer selection is excellent, the cocktails are fantastic, the salsas and sauces are all on point, and the glazed donut finishes the meal off just right.  It's a little on the pricey side (especially if you're used to grabbing some amazing street tacos in California and Mexico for spare change) but that's par for the course for truly great spots in downtown Calgary.  If I'm within 5 blocks of walking and a little hungry before or after drinks, this is the spot I head to."}
{"text":"This place was great! Don't know if I love the whole sharing plates idea but the food was yummy! We started with some delicious guacamole and salsas. Only downfall was the amount of chips that came with it. We had a group of 7 and had to ask for chips twice. We had the steak and chicken and they were both yummy.  Again though, could have used a few more tortillas. The bill was pretty steep as the drinks were kind of expensive. Overall would recommend because the food was just so good."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday - a must try!  Another lunch with my mom friends, we decided to try this place for lunch.  Yay for planning lunch for Tuesday, as we fell in to Taco Tuesday= cheap tacos.  I tried the mushroom, beef and chorizo tacos- lovely flavours and very tasty.  We shared the salsa tasters and definitely the most interesting one was with peanuts in them.  I loved the variety of salsas- who knew there were so many types to enjoy!  We also shared the 3 desserts - each bite was delicious and were hits in our group of 5.  The margaritas were made with Mezcal- my first try of this type of alcohol, and when our lovely server described it as \"smoky\" she was bang on!  Smoky margaritas- a nice and welcome change from the \"norm.\" I really enjoyed lunch here- our server offered great direction and feedback, and all of the food we tried was stellar.  My only negatives were this place doesn't accept reservations, and since the place was full for lunch, it was very loud.    Can't wait to return, esp to take advantage of cheap tacos on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"A little pricey for the size of the portions, but really good food and super fresh. I could eat a million of those little tacos. Yum!"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, friendly staff, great variety on the menu for brunch. Read about it in a magazine and on yelp so I thought I'd check it out.   The mushroom tacos were delicious. The food in general was great quality.   I would love to come back here again and check out their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Only being in Calgary for a few days, we let Yelp choose where we ate. We enjoyed the hipster/rustic atmosphere of this kind of small restaurant. The tables are packed in and at one point, the waiter's butt was hovering over the guacamole. But WOW, that guacamole sure was good!  We also had the carrots, the zanahorias which I saw a few people recommend and they did not disappoint. Very tasty, topped with cheese,cilantro and some other spices/additions. The carrots even though it seems strange to say were probably the best part of the meal.  We ordered 4 different tacos, including the beef tongue, chicken, chorizo and carnitas. The carnitas were both our favourite. Only I had the beef tongue and it was a bit strange but that was to be expected, I wanted something different. We both thought the chorizo was kind of gross and didn't really taste like normal chorizo, maybe it was heavily salted or there wasn't enough other toppings like adding pineapple could have been nice.  The chocolate flan was a big hit too, probably our second favourite part of the meal. The flan had a lot of crushed coconut, almonds and maybe coffee beans or cacao nibs, we're not sure. It was delicious though and highly recommended.  The service was very good as well. Overall, a nice find but I think it would be better after a couple of visits once you know what entrees to get and which ones to avoid. The pork belly pibil also looked great but we didn't ordered it. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks! This place has a line up for a reason. Loved the mezcalgaritas - so worth trying (margaritas but with a smoky taste) as well as their lamb dish (barbaco de cordero) the frijoles tacos, and the donut! Excellent atmosphere great for any night of the week!"}
{"text":"OMG how had I not been here yet?  This place is my absolute favourite Mexican place in town hands down. I don't even think anything else exists for me anymore...   The Guac is awesome work excellent portioning.  Every taco and tostada I have had is just amazingly flavoured. You have one and think that's your favourite and then you have the next and get to confused to logically assess the situation.  Great problem to have though!    It might be hard to save room but try a donut then seem like a silly followup but they are famous for a reason.....   The only down side is its not large and it's very busy with no reservations. I'm also uncovered they do catering and it can be delivered as they will pop it in an uber or taxi for ya.  Sweet!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch with the kids, a new place to try, and seeing how we enjoyed the taco joints in Las Vegas, Ottawa and Edmonton I thought we should give this place a try.  Big disappointment to say the least.  Let's start off with the atmosphere, it's noisy and loud. They say it's kid friendly but it's not.  They have mostly bar stools with no back support so not for little ones.  The tacos aren't that great and we've had way better in terms of flavour, portion elsewhere.  What gets me though is how greasy the beef and pork tacos are.  They're dripping in oil for whatever reason.  The tacos are not as soft and fresh as other places I've eaten them at.  The last thing is the crazy high prices for these very small tacos.  We had 5 beef, 5 chicken, 3 pork, and two mushrooms, and an order of eggs with sour dough bread and avocado, total was outrageous $62.50.  We weren't full and decided to go elsewhere for more food otherwise we may have had to break my son's piggy bank.  Needless to say I won't be back here and don't recommend it.  The food isn't that great or worth the price tag."}
{"text":"Awesome flavor on all dishes. Great salsas and guac! I would only add a few more choices for the ala carte taco choices like beef and chicken fajita."}
{"text":"Native tongues does.not.disappoint.  The tacos are indeed, like a sultry home-town tongue, curling around your cheeks, caressing your tooth holsters with a suavity only known to your first, passionate, teenage love. Ahh to be young and free again! Well, this is your very best next thing, get your salivating self down to Native Tongues and set your taste buds FREEEEEE."}
{"text":"Best taqueria in Calgary by far. I've tried so many restaurants looking for authentic mexican tacos. And this is the BEST Ive found in Calgary after years of trying restaurant after restaurant. Our waiter was attentive and cheerful even though it was loud in there (Saturday night). The food was amazing and the atmosphere was great. Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"I was meandering aimlessly for a lunch spot and stumbled upon to this place and it happened to be Taco Tuesday (WIN!) and there was no wait for a table (DOUBLE WIN!).  The space is nice and staff were friendly and attentive.  We ordered the ceviche to share.  It was just okay, a bit on the bland side.  I had Peruvian ceviche, which really ruined all other ceviche for me as nothing even comes close to being as good.  We also tried all of the tacos.  I found the brisket, pork and chicken ones to be dry.  The chorizo was good, as chorizo usually is.  My favourites were the refried beans and the mushroom tacos.  I even ordered more of the mushroom tacos after I finished.    In all, a decent place for tacos.  Food wasn't too memorable either way."}
{"text":"Love the Name as much as the Food, been a couple times now and enjoyed everything from the \"chips y guacamole, salsa taster, tuna contramar, actually everything was great. Leave room for POSTRES(after the meal, aka deserts) loved the Donas(glazed donut) and TRES LECHES (three milk cake) was a hit with my family. Not a drinker but my friends all say that the cocktails are amazing so I'll take their word for it. Definitely one of my pleases to go to in 2018."}
{"text":"Just TRIED to go for lunch here, and they would not seat us in the completely empty restaurant, because we only had 2/3 of our party.  SERIOUSLY?!?  They may have great food, but I will never try this place again."}
{"text":"Native Tongues is a great addition to the Calgary Mexican scene, I tried several different dishes during my visit there including three different kinds of tacos, the guacamole and the mexican corn. I wrapped up the dinner by sharing the donut of the day which was fresh and tasty and not to sweet.   This is a great place to share different dishes with your dining companions and the decor and atmosphere is really funky with lots of different details that align with the Mexican theme."}
{"text":"I placed a pick up order here, late on a Sunday night.   When I arrived, it wasn quite ready, but the staff was super friendly, and took the time to chat with me. This was very cool, instead of me standing awkwardly alone, waiting for the order to be finished.   I had the guacamole with chips,2  carnitas tacos and a chorizo taco,  All were excellent and highly recommended.  The only thing I would do differently next time would be to dine in so I could sample the tequila. ; )"}
{"text":"I found the meat in the tacos(lengua, chorizo, carnitas) and the octopus to be very good, but all the vegetable sides and relishes to be very bland. When I ordered the pickled vegetables I was expecting Mexican heat with lots of fresh sliced jalape√±o not a sweet vinigar pickling with three canned pickled jalape√±o slices in the dish. The red and green salsas were just to mild for me, and had no spiciness to them at all. It is definitely a busy place that provides excellent service in spite of all the tables being full."}
{"text":"We were disappointed with our meal there. We ordered the barbacoa de Cordero tacos al carbon, which the menu says very clearly it's grilled over charcoal. What arrived at our table was a braised lamb neck in it's braising liquid. Good but not what the menu said AND not what we had in mind. We wanted a grilled piece of lamb.  Also very disappointed in the accompaniments in that there was only a small piece of avocado, a few roasted onions and a small poblano. Not enough for two people.  This was a dish to share and at $36 you shouldn't be skipping on the onions, pepper and avocado.  Won't recommend the chilaquiles with chorizo which were swimming in oil.  Not sure what the big noise is about this restaurant."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a gem in town! Great atmosphere, awesome food, professional service by the staff. We were a group of 8 with kids and called to book a table but being told that we should just drop in and being put on wait list. Dropped in, waited for short time and the table was all set for us. The waiter was all over the table with great suggestions of food and drinks and took care of the kids like his own; food was amazing, drinks were special. Will definitely go back. Thanks for such a great service."}
{"text":"Great tacos, and good service.. Can't ask for more. The server was helpful with recommending menu items, and accommodating changes for my non onion eating son.."}
{"text":"I tried Native Tongues with a group of four on a Thursday night at 7 pm. There was no line but the place was packed so we had to wait for about 15 minutes for a table. The service was welcoming and our server was attentive throughout the meal. We ordered the guacamole, the nopales (cactus paddle) the lengua (beef), carnita (pork) and chorizo tacos. The tacos flavorful and invoked similar flavors that I've had in Mexico but were $4 for one small taco. The guacamole was slightly cheaper than Anejo at $13 and was fresh. I thought the cactus at Native Tongues was much more tender than at Anejo and was quite delicious. Native Tongues is a great addition to Calgary's food scene but don't expect it to be cheap. One of my friends knew the manager and even after comping us a dessert, the bill came to $30 a person."}
{"text":"Overrated.  When having to wait over an hour to get a table, there is an expectation for good food but, that wasn't the case. Despite the small size of the tacos, which was fine, they weren't really that flavorful. Both the Suadero (brisket) and Pollo Adobo (chicken) are just shredded meat with very similar spices. You couldn't tell the difference between which ones you were eating because of the mushy texture. Feels like they were made with little, to no effort, and all came out of one giant pot of meat.  The guacamole is good but reall not that special either. Nice d√©cor though"}
{"text":"Can't believe this place is a 4-star on yelp. Totally over priced for its quality. The meat inside the tacos were so dry and hard to chew. It's like chewing papers. Chips and guacamole are $15. Guacamole was really just smash avocado with nothing inside. I would never recommend my friends to eat at this place."}
{"text":"A lot of hype. Well done food, but very overpriced also. I'd rather eat at Chipoltle's, guaranteed. Not only better value, but better, more delicious, actual food too. Unless someone else is buying, or its a group event, I have no desire to visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Pros: delicious food!  Cons: cramped space, worst chairs, loud, small portions  Long version:  They don't take reservations (which is fine) but the front staff seemed confused as to how to run a line up at the door of a busy restaurant... anyway after some confusion we did get a table, we sat at one of the tall ones with 4 chairs. Most. uncomfortable. chair. ever. The stools have a very stiff back that forces you to lean over the already cramped table... They've definitely sacrificed function for hipster chic on those tables, but the benches and shorter tables looked much more comfortable.  Lots of the dishes are family style, and it says it takes 30 mins to prepare. which is fine but we had a time limit so we decided to split 3 appetizers between 4 of us and get some tacos.  The guacamole was good, nothing special, and it felt a little small for $10. One avocado worth with some hot peppers, no salsa, and 17 chips. yes, we counted them. 17... To be fair, we asked for more chips and they brought a massive basket of them (charged an extra $2.00 which is fine) but really, for 10 bucks give us some chips please.  The shrimp appetizer was AMAZING, so delicious!  The ceviche was good, although not what we expected. Its 4 pieces of tuna on a tostada with guacamole and radishes.  Tacos were really good, the lengua was so tender, don't be afraid of this one it is really good!    Drinks: the cocktail list is confusing, and surprisingly none of them featured mescal, except the mescal-a-rita. There is a massive list of mescals to choose from, but the server seemed un-informed on them and was not really able to answer any of our questions about it.  It's a new place, so I am sure they are working out some kinks to make it run smoother, it seems like half the staff are new and are still learning the menu etc.  If you love mexican, you wont be disappointed by the food. Rumour is that they are planning a take-out window, which would be perfect, because the food definitely shines over the service, even at calgary's low standards."}
{"text":"Don't really go out to eat mexican food often but I think I will after eating tacos here :)   This restaurant doesn't take reservations but we were able to find seats with no issues on a Wednesday evening. The decor is rustic with dim lighting and interesting artwork on the walls - made for a cozy atmosphere overall.   The server was super nice and helped us with the menu since it was our first time at the restaurant. They have happy hour food and drinks till 6 but no tacos on it when we went so we ordered from the regular menu.   We tried all the tacos on there (6 each) so we could figure out which one we liked best and order more later. That was the original plan but 6 was a good amount for one person haha - its about $3 each and comes with a side of salsa verde and mild salsa.   I liked the vegetarian taco (Hongos) with mushrooms and queen fresco the best! Super cheesy goodness! Second fav was the pollo adobo with the roast chicken and picked red onion  the carnitas with the confit pork was really spicy so watch out for that one if you can't handle spice.   The tres leches was a great dessert choice - so pretty and yummy! Totally would recommend it!"}
{"text":"I don't remember how or why my friend and I ended up here when I visited Calgary last year. I don't remember exactly what we ordered. What I DO remember is loving it so much that it was somewhere I HAD to return to and this time, I brought more friends. If you're expecting \"authentic\" Mexican food then, yes, you may be disappointed. Native Tongues is more akin to Mexican-inspired tapas--more than you'd pay normally for Mexican food, certainly, and just a little bit fancier. But good food and great service makes this place a 5-star stop for me, and certainly a place I'd return to and recommend (obviously)."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  Amazing bar tenders and amazing food and mezcal.   The staff was super knowledgeable on the food and drinks. Atmosphere was great! Food was amazing!  If only we had one of these in Vancouver I would be there every chance I got.   Thanks! Next time I'm in Calgary I will swing by for Tacos and Margaritas for sure."}
{"text":"It am picky about Mexican food but this place to die for. Great cocktails and amazing food. My favorites there are the elotes, their octopus dish but what hit the spot for me was their carne asada. They don't have it on the menu all the time but it is the best carne asada ever. I like the buzz and the super cool interiors."}
{"text":"Food here is pricey and the portions are small. Each taco is $3.95 and it is small, it'll be gone in 2 bites. Really not recommended for those with big appetites because your bill will be huge.  The flan dessert is $10, which makes me think... how is that dessert can be 10 bucks? I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Wow!!! This is a fantastic authentic experience!!! I am very particular about Mexican food and this is one of the best places I have tried.  From Horchata to fresh guacamole and donuts this place is magnificent.  Even lucky we decided to go on a Tuesday and it was Taco Tuesday! 2.50 Tacos. A pleasant surprise!  Very enjoyable! This place is great to catch up with friends.   The staff was very friendly.  But, it also has a fun side which makes it a great choice for date night. The restaurant is spacious and really nicely designed.  I ate so much and still wanted to eat more.  If you have a chance eat here!  They also have light Mexican beers to wash down your tacos and is affordable.  The appies and small size tacos are made for sharing and the unique flavors of the tacos are all delicious!"}
{"text":"Good food here. They recently took the tacos off of the Happy Hour menu but I love the food and the margaritas"}
{"text":"YUMMO!  Love the atmosphere and the food, drinks.  The salsa sampler is a must!"}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  I really liked this place! I'm not too crazy when it comes to Mexican food, but I've definitely been eating more of that lately.  A friend recommended me to this place after checking out the Instagram photos and falling in love with it. We arrived at around 2pm on a Sunday, and it was still very busy and we had to wait 15 minutes for a table.  The menu isn't too extensive, but the staples are there, some with a fusion twist. I had the pollo frito and the suadero, carnitas, and hongos tacos. Everything tasted excellent, especially the pollo frito and the hongos taco. The fried donuts are definitely something everyone should try at least once, even as a dessert.  Service was great here as well, and everyone in my party was accommodated without problems. Definitely a great recommendation, and I will forward this place to friends visiting Calgary."}
{"text":"I love this place! Good food and service. Last time I went was for brunch, it was amazing and they had strawberry horchata. Yum."}
{"text":"First time here was for their yyc taco fiesta red snapper tacos. I've been trying to stop in for awhile and finally the time was right.  Second stop was with girl friends. Both times were simply delicious so I honestly can't wait for the third + visit.  They have a cute little take out window for those who can't stay plus they offer up great taco deals throughout the week like margarita Mondays and happy hour tacos.  I love the decor. Having visited Mexican restaurants in Tijuana in my youth, the Native Tongues is a reminder of those little south of the border cafes. It's an eclectic mix of Mexican decor with an open kitchen and wood burning grill which seriously tantalize your taste buds.  I dont know if they take resos but if you have to wait to get in, it's worth it.  The only disappointment is the sky high prices. In this economy there's no need for it."}
{"text":"This place was conveniently located under our hotel... so since we love tacos we thought what the heck lets try it out! We were seated right away at a window bar since the place was already busy at 5:00 pm (after work crowd) but we had a lovely view of the city street. They had super cool rustic decor and neat artwork on the walls. Some tables for 2-4 people and then some long communal type seating. Our server was very nice and explained the menu well. Our food and drinks were served quick for being busy in there.  Lucky us as it was happy hour and we took advantage of the $5 margaritas... which were delish! We also order CHILAQUILES off the happy hour menu and the serving size was very nice  for the price $5 the plate had a pile of tortilla chips with salsa verde , fresh cilantro and queso Fresca.. we added chorizo for extra 6$ (nice and spicy). We also ordered some CAMARONES AL CHILMOLE off their appetizer menu .. these had prawns and a delicious dark sauce topped with fresh herbs...the server suggested  we ad add an extra tortilla to this dish so we could share evenly between the two of us which was the perfect amount of food.   Unfortunately we were only popping in for a drink and an appie before an event so we couldn't try the rest of the menu... but we will definitely try coming back to Native Tounges on our next visit to Calgary. (Still dreaming about those CHILAQUILES)"}
{"text":"These tacos are not your traditional Mexican tacos. I'll start with my experience. I'm from California so were pretty spoiled when it comes to tacos. I came in with 5 friends and were seated immediately. Service was spot on, very attentive. Refilled our waters without asking and checked on us often. We came during happy hour so the tacos were $2.50 instead of $3.50.  I ordered 2 beef brisket tacos, 1 pollo adobo, 1 carnitas. The brisket was shredded and overly salty. It was very flavorful, very overpowering. The only upside was that the beef was very moist. The chicken was also shredded, almost looked like tuna from the can. It was topped with pickled radish . The chicken was very mushy and tasted a little off, also very salty. Last the pork was probably my favorite even though I wouldn't even come back for the pork. It was seasoned fine, texture was a little dry but a little moist? Maybe they mixed two batches of pork together? My friends ordered the chorizo and they said all they could taste was pepper. A couple of my friends didn't even finish their tacos and the others finished their tacos cause we came from hiking all day and didn't eat for 10 hours. Only upside was that their chips and guacamole was perfect but who can mess up on guac?  They also charge 18% gratuity on our bill which I wasn't sure if they do that for everyone or just large parties but we didn't mind cause their service was great. Maybe we just didn't order the right stuff? But their tacos were on happy hour so how could we resist?"}
{"text":"It's definitely not cheap, but the food is great!  We got the salsa taster to share- would highly recommend! A bit weird that there's an extra charge for the chips on top of the menu price.  I got the bean and cheese empanada as my main course- small but delicious.  The agua fresca is also great- not too sweet and a good amount.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've tried all of the tacos and they are all very tasty. I always get the corn - ESQUITES.  The tacos are cheaper on Tuesday. This place is always packed. It's easier to get a table if you go here for lunch."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, decor and service so a 3/5. However, having recently tried the delicious, cut through it like butter octopus at Bar Isabel and moan inducing elotes at La Carnita (both in Toronto),  I was slightly disappointed in the food here.  My first time at NT I tried their grilled octopus dish and boy, did it fall very short of my expectations. It was tough, chewy and the sides lacked imagination (sliced avo, chopped onion, cilantro, flavourless grilled Serrano pepper and crushed peanut in oil). The next time I was here I decided to give the elotes a try and I was as equally disappointed.  It was flavourful but drenched in some sort of sticky yogurt and could have used lots more grilling depth and seasoning. The most disappointing was probably the ceviche which couldn't even be truly considered a ceviche (chunks of chopped tuna maybe?) On the plus side though,  the beef tongue taco was very yummy although I'm not sure it'd warrant another visit."}
{"text":"Super glad we found something open and still serving food at 10pm. Turned out that after 10pm, its reverse happy hour so tacos were only $2.50 each. We tried the beef and the chicken tacos. Good amount of filling but a bit on the oily side."}
{"text":"So good! hard to pay some of these prices when you've paid basically pennies for the same food on the streets of Central America, but delicious none the less. Atmosphere is cool, great drinks, friendly service."}
{"text":"Fantastic flavors here in booze and food, the selection is top notch and the tacos were epic, even for a LA taqueria veteran like me. Staff is super Cool, definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"If your looking for some authentic mexcian food than this is the place to try! Service was top notch, I didnt like the first drink i ordered and the waiter and manager both came to aplogize and refund the drink even though I wanted to pay for it becuase I made the mistake ordering it! Food was fantastic, recommend ordering one of each taco. They are small but well worth the price!"}
{"text":"Omg omg omg omfg. Best tacos ever. Best margaritas ever.  best bartender ever( Dillon). I want to eat more and more but my poor belly is full. Oh yeah... Best guacamole ever too. Hot sauce was bomb too. Hot but bomb."}
{"text":"I love the takeout here!!  I honestly haven't sat down in here because of how good the take out is haha. The FULLY LOADED burrito is to die for. Full of flavor and everything is cooked perfect. If your used to European food this is where it's at, especially the Chorizo taco, the best!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick after event bite!  The tacos were savory & delicious. I recommend the chorizo! And we even had dessert! Not the typical churros, the Donas was fantastic.  The ambiance was Mexican chic, suitable for a Calgary hipster crowd!"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful treat, love to share a few dishes amongst my party every time. Everything on the menu was great, enjoyed the starter with an assortment of salsa, and chips."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for food, 5 for service and vibe.  Came here on a cold winter night because it was by the hotel we stayed at.  Native tongues tacqueria has nice decor and vibe.  We tried a couple tacos - the chicken, pork and mushroom.  They were pretty tasty but portion was really small for $3.50 each.  My favourite was the mushroom taco.  Other stuff we tried included the Pollo Asado ($30) - the grilled chicken with romaine & tomato salad and, guac and chips ($15). They were both alright, nothing to write home about. I'd come back, but maybe for happy hour next time."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with my hubby and 9 year old son who hates Guac. As always, made him try it and he loved it, score!!! Seriously, best guac in the city. Even better than Anejo. Sorry, had to say it.  We also had the corn with cheese, mayo and onion which tasted great on our nachos. Hubby had the burger and could not stop raving about the sauce and the flavour. I had a tiny bite of the meat which was yummy.   Next up,the tacos. I had the chicken, pork, beef tongue and mushrooms and also tried a bite of my son's chorizo. That's the entire taco selection  minus the taco with just beans, LOL!!!  Boys enjoyed their chorizo but my faves were tongue and mushrooms . And yes,I just put a love emoticon for emphasis on yummmmm!!! The tacos come with two types of salsa and plenty of lime wedges.  Some tacos have cheese and some don't. They all have onions and cilantro as toppings.   We were pretty full but saved room to share a donut. It was a bit greasy but had a traditional fluffiness that was less dense than a Tim Horton's old fashion plain donut but not as fluffy as a honey dip.  It's a bad comparison but get the donut for $5. Great way to end a meal... Overall ambience was upbeat and fun with an open kitchen. Our waitress was attentive a friendly. The seats aren't comfy but didn't detract from our enjoyment. We will be back to try the large sharing plates!!!"}
{"text":"Yeah, another five-star review from Manzo, but I've been having great dining experiences lately, and I'm more motivated to review positively than negatively- so here it is, another gem. Partner and I had lunch today (a bitterly cold Saturday, Jan 16); it was pleasantly buzzing but far from crowded so in we went. It was an absolute coup. We both ordered the agua du jour (it was jamaica, which they for some reason call by its English name of hibiscus but which is also called sorel in the Caribbean), and was sweet and very refreshing- you MUST drink sorel with ice as it's just too sweet and syrupy otherwise; this one was pretty much perfect. We ordered two tacos, one each lengua and carnitas. I had the carnitas. It was absolutely stunning. I was a little put off by their use of just one tortilla, but what a tortilla- thin and elegant house-made from house-made masa, it's tender and delicate and really like no other tortilla from any taqueria I've been to. The meat was rich and just fantastic. Partner reported that the lengua was similarly exemplary. For mains we both got the hamburguesa which comes with house-made potato chips, and oh oh ohhhhhhhhhh what a burger this is. Texturally- my god it does not get better. It TASTED amazing as well with this house sauce that's mayo based with spice and pickle. One of the, I'd say, three best burgers I've ever had in this city. Service was great, vibe was casual and comfortable for all groups (saw kids and seniors and all in between, all enjoying the experience). Look forward to many more visits!"}
{"text":"My younger brother is headed back to Saskatoon soon so my sister and I let him decide a cuisine for dinner.  His choices were either Steak or Mexican - of course once he mentioned the two, we pulled out our handy dandy Yelp! apps and did a little search. A list popped but what we couldn't come to an agreement until Kenny mentioned Native Tongues. DING DING DING! I knew it was hot and new and I've been creeping their Instagram so I was totally all for it.  Native Tongues is located on 12th avenue SW, down the street from The Beltliner.  Street parking is available.  We didn't know exactly where it was so we wandered a bit and couldn't find it.  Couldn't find it until Kenny pulled his google maps out and we were literally standing right in front of it. Native Tongues is located on the corner - it was Sunday about 730PM, so still light out and their red glowing sign was unreadable - I think the font is awful and I wasn't able to identify \"Native Tongues\" until I looked closely.    Aaaaanyways, we walked in and it wasn't busy so we got seated right away at a high top.  The space isn't huge and there are a bunch of high tops as well as long family style tables and some normal table tops.  The bar and kitchen have an open concept so you are able to see everything in action.  We ordered drinks right away, I got a glass horchata (traditional Mexican milk drink, cinnamony), Brandon ordered some blackberry cocktail, Kenny got a beer and Danielle just got water.  The menu consists of: Antojitos, Ensaladas, Tacos de Cuisados, Tacos al Carbon, Dulces....man...I know this is a Mexican place and they go all fancy schmancy with their words but at first look, I was like -_- I can't understand anything (I could but you know what I mean).  We asked for recommendations, the Elotes and Ceviche were mentioned so we shared an order of each.  Elotes is grilled corn on the cob topped with crema, queso, chile, and cilantro.  One order of elotes is literally one corn on the cob cut in half.  There were four of us and all wanted to have a taste so we sliced all the corn off and mixed in in the sauce and shared.  The ceviche was fresh seasonal fish which was tuna cooked in lime and chiles on top of guacamole and cilantro on a round tortilla chip then all finished with radishes - there were nice big chunks of the fish but overall a small portion size. The antojitos were tasty but not mind blowing.  We ordered a bunch of tacos to share: 2 beef tongue, 2 refried beans, 5 mushroom, 4 chorizo, 4 confit pork.  All the tacos are stewed meat and vegetables on top of corn tortillas and served with a bunch of limes, salsa verde (green) and salsa rojo.  I must mentioned, that when the tacos came, the lighting was so dim, we couldn't really identify each taco.  The server mentioned she couldn't really see and I even pulled out my iPhone flashlight.  The tacos are pretty small, can be gone in two bites, max three but they are quite tasty.  My sister and I didn't want beef tongue only because...its beef tongue but she had a bite and she really enjoyed it. My favorite was the mushroom taco, super flavorful and I loved the crema on top.  We asked for some hot sauce and they have Valentina which is my favorite because it's not super hot but has that kick at the end.  We all enjoyed the tacos - they are little pockets of flavor.  My sister mentioned that it was one of the better Mexican places she has tried.  Overall, the service was great, super attentive and always filling our waters and asking how everything was.  I wish the lighting was more...there only because I like to see what I'm eating.  The high tops don't have a lot of room, especially for a table of four, I felt something was going to fall off the table.  The food was good but the antojitos that we ordered were overpriced for the portion size.  We had the two appys and four-ish tacos each and we still had room for more food but decided not to order anymore.  Will I be back?  I will probably end up here at some point only because my girlfriend really loves tacos and I went here without her."}
{"text":"I came to the takeout window before going to the Beltline Aquatic Center next door. They have a reduced menu for takeout that has a few items (tacos, burrito, donuts, and a few other items I can't recall). I had the burrito, which I asked for without meat. The burrito was a hefty little package which was perfect because I was starving. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they didn't just remove the meat but also substituted a delicious mushroom mixture. Despite the fact that the burrito probably weighed several pounds, it didn't feel super heavy and greasy with the beans and rice. It also had guacamole and other vegetables which made it really flavorful and it was extremely filling. My friends got tacos, which they said were good, albeit a little small. I would definitely come back and try their full menu since their takeout window is so awesome!"}
{"text":"Mucho delicious-io! I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Native Tongues Taqueria.   I knew I was going to have a good time at Native Tongues when I saw the really awesome neon light signage! This place oozes coolness. I feel like I gained like 500 cool points just by eating here.  The atmosphere is great. It feels really authentic. I have never been to Mexico, but this is how I envisioned a stylized, upscale(ish) restaurants to be like. The walls have a really nice texture and I enjoyed the art on the walls a lot. The Mexican decor elevates the atmosphere and it almost feels like you're enjoying a festive meal with your neighbours, especially with the great soundtrack of soul/funk playing in the background.  The food was unbelievably yummy! I had the mushroom tacos (I can't remember the official name) and the corn on the cob. Guys, it was so good that I am dreaming about eating them again. Very succulent, savourly and filling.  I also got the \"Squirt\" which is the Mexican version of Sprite. The name made me laugh and I wanted to share that with you. Oh and it tastes exactly like Sprite.   The way the menu works is that you can order \"snack size\" tacos for approx. $3.50-$5. Don't let the size confuse you! Two tacos is really filling. Our waiter was super friendly and knowledgable about the menu and his menu recommendations was on the spot! I trust him when he says the shareable plates are big enough to feed four people-- something I plan to test out the next time I am there."}
{"text":"Finally Calgary has a killer legit Mexican taqueria !! I've been back three times. Things I recommend and have eaten every time: nopales salad ( cactus salad - so good , don't be afraid if you have never tried cactus ) , Hongos tacos ( mushroom)- house made corn tortillas , ceviche ( amazing), roasted corn ( the new crack ) , mas margaritas and tequila !!!!! Feliz!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The ceviche was awesome, the tuna tostada might be the best thing I've ever put in my mouth. Our bartender Rick, we sat at the bar, was knowledgeable in all the food and was a hell of a mixologist to boot.  I will go back again when in Calgary."}
{"text":"As far as Mexican food is concerned , Native Tongues would qualify is \"Chingon\"  The Octopus Taco and the Pibil pork are very very nice. I also like the Tongue and Frijoles Tacos. The appetizers that I have tried are all also good. I have to also mention that I did not write this review under the influence of their Mezcal collection."}
{"text":"Food is good if you can find it on your plate :D    No beer? Very loud We are waiting 47 min for order (still) yes 47min !!!! Tiny portions STAY AWAY  It's been 1 hour and 15minutes, we are still waiting!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying: I'm Mexican. So I have very high standards when it comes to Mexican food. Most of what passes for \"Mexican\" anywhere north of, say, Texas, is just 'basura' (rubbish): barely palatable or just barely one step above Taco Bell.  Or ridiculous places with stereotypical atmosphere with giant sombreros, fishbowl sized margarita glasses that attract a certain crowd (think a certain restaurant in Kensington).  After searching high and low, we have finally found the light in downtown Calgary: Native Tongues Taqueria.  The food here is delicious and the tacos are very authentic to what you'd find on the streets of Mexico (albeit at 10x the price). The margaritas were wonderful, though very expensive and small. The place had a great selection of Mexican beers. The guacamole was divine. The restaurant decor was elegant and minimalist and the crowd was sophisticated and refined, from kids to hipsters to old folks like me. I knocked off one star for the price; expect to pay close to $100 per couple for dinner and drinks. But wow i'm a huge fan. Would come here more often if it weren't so pricey."}
{"text":"Having traveled from California to Calgary we did a little bar hopping and found this gem. Excellent craft cocktails, great food selection and the best \"star-tender\" I've ever had Tom! All the staff was super friendly and talkative, can't recommend this pace enough."}
{"text":"Super impressed with this place. I read a lot of the reviews here before going and tried the carrots which the review basically says are life changing. I can confirm they are. I've never had carrots like that in my life, try them!  I also had the drink Bam Bam Dilla. I'm not a big cocktail fan and based on the description thought it would be really sweet tasting, it wasn't it was super tasty and if it weren't for the price I would have drank it all night.  We Tried several tacos. The chorizo I found quite salty and wouldn't recommend. The pork was by far my favourite followed by the cheese and bean. I didn't try the beef tongue I just couldn't stomach the fact it was tongue. If I had a few more bam bam dillas I probably could work up the nerve. Next time perhaps. We saved room for the doughnut for dessert. The first bite at first I thought it wasn't anything special but then the flavours really set in. It tasted home made, melted in your mouth. It was heavenly.  The service was outstanding. They were attentive, fast and friendly. Not what you typically get for a trendy restaurant in Calgary.  Overall, mind blown! Check it out."}
{"text":"Oh it is an okay place. Owned by the same guy who owns Ox and Angela or something. Is there a theme here? Spanish restaurant spawns Mexican restaurant. Colonialism. Check.   So, same cocktails as Ox. They are good, and boozy. When I am paying $12 for a cocktail, I would like to feel tipsy after two. I ordered the \"cecina\" taco platter and I found that Mexican street food is apparently kind of bland and dry. I did like the appetizer called \"esquites\" because I like corn and butter.   Also, I can't remember if the servers dress in traditional Mexican garb. I wish they did because it would totally complete the \"experience.\" Tied it back to colonialism."}
{"text":"I'm from Mexico and I can say these are real, Mexican tacos. The chef is from Mexico City and we could tell right away. Best tacos in town!! And they open late so it can't get any better. Gracias!"}
{"text":"Wow, highly recommend Taco Tuesday's for the first timer to get a good and cheap sampling of their uber awesome tacos! We had the taco platter combination of beef tongue (because, like where else would you find that in Calgary), carnitas and chicken and have to tell ya, everything was hands down authentically prepared food-as-if-you-were-in-Mexico. The taco here is earnest and bursting forth with just the star of it all -- the perfectly seasoned meat and cilantro on a simple corn tortilla. Doesn't get much more awesome than that. But wait, it DOES! On heartbreak weekend, I sat at the bar with a friend to drown my sorrows with happy festive food as an incentive to return to the living (the break up made me go in starvation mode, lost my appetite) and was not disappointed. The appetizer line-up gave me the incentive to keep on chewing. First, the appetizer front liner -- Sea urchin, guacamole, Serrano peppers and tomatoes! Fantabulous, really. Next, the Gambas al Trujillo is a killer pick -- wonderfully prepared flash-fried Giant Prawn with chili pepper oil and all that's crunchy. MUST ORDER with of course, the   epic Bam Bam Dilla! A masterpiece concoction of libation wizardry prepared with burning sugar cube, lime, rum, almond syrup, banana liquor and Pineapple. And yes, the bar was not a bad place to recuperate with a cute and attentive  bartender to nurse our achy heart back to the pink of health  The final piece de resistance of course is the Steak entree. There are truly, not enough words on Yelp to describe the megaton of perfect seasoning and cooking of such a fabulous uber big piece of tender beef. Enough said, time for good eats! GET OVER HERE!"}
{"text":"Items Selected: Zanahorias - Grilled Alberta Carrots, Agave Butter Crema, Queso, Cilantro Calabaza Tostada - Shaved Zucchini, Sesame, Whipped Queso, Salsa Macha, Tomatoes Tacos de Guisado - Suadero, Chorizo Rojo con Papas, Pollo Adobo, Hongos con Kale with White Onion and Cilantro, Salsa Verde, Salsa Roja Donas - Glazed and Made In-House Daily Alfajores - Shortbread Cookie, Dulce de Leche, Coconut  Finding Canada oddly intrigued by the cuisine of Mexico, the two nations separated by nearly 2,300 miles of United States, one could not help but be curious about the strongly positive reviews of Native Tongues Taqueria, the open kitchen looking quite Caucasian during an afternoon visit but the owners doing an admirable job of replicating the feel of similar modern concepts in Los Angeles and elsewhere.  Focusing squarely on Mexican Street Food and a lively atmosphere, the space still packed by a lingering lunch crowd at 1:30pm, it was from a hurried middle-age woman that the menu was explained with a focus on portion sizes, a daily special of Mole Chicken Thighs that sounded excellent only heard of later when it was described to a neighboring table, long after I'd already received the bulk of my plates.  Divided into Antojitos, individual Tacos and family-style Al Carbon presentations along with Tostadas, Desserts, Cocktails and Beer, it was after considerable perusal that tough choices were made to focus on variety, a total of eight items requested as the kitchen worked with quiet fervor.  Served in three courses, though one and two did overlap some, first bites from Native Tongues came by way of Vegetarian-friendly plates of grilled Carrots lightly topped in sweet butter and fresh Cheese alongside an elegant fried Tortilla topped in razor-thin Zucchini slices with an airy Cheese not unlike Mascarpone that helped to balance the smoke and fire from a thick salsa made almost entirely of dried Chiles.  Drinking plenty of water with this meal, though no heartburn or adverse effects were noted later, it was as I was enjoying the Carrots that a silver tray of Tacos and Salsa was presented, the tortillas unfortunately brought in from elsewhere and thus accounting for the low cost of just $2CAD each on Tuesdays, with the braised Meats highlighted by spicy Adobo Chicken while the combination of fibrous Mushrooms and crispy Kale was also well-balanced and tasty.  Disappointed that Tres Leches has been struck from the menu, especially as Native Tongues' famous $5CAD Doughnut is really no better than what can be had at most mom n' pop shops for a buck anywhere in North America, the sizable Alfajore was a far more fanciful finish, the buttery Shortbread Sandwich filled to overflowing with smooth Dulce de Leche before a dusting of Powdered Sugar and a roll in flaked Coconut."}
{"text":"3.5/5  The first and most important thing to know is that you cannot leave here without trying a donut! These are seriously the best donuts I've ever had. The donuts are fresh and soft with a nice and simple glaze that doesn't take away from the amazing dough. My husband and I shared a donut, but I wish we had each gotten our own! I didn't want to share...  The tacos were quite good. The chorizo tacos were incredible, juicy and so delicious. I would highly recommend the chorizo tacos. We also tried the chicken tacos, and these were OK. The flavour didn't amaze me, but then again, these are chicken tacos! The meat isn't as juicy or flavourful as the chorizo. I also enjoyed the salsas served with the tacos. We were at Native Tongues for brunch, so we also tried the baked enchiladas with scrambled eggs. These were okay at best. Nothing special at all and quite bland. The portion was pretty small too for $15.  Go for the chorizo tacos and the donuts.. skip the enchiladas!"}
{"text":"Being a Texan, I'm weary of any type of Mexican or spicy food this far up north. The drinks are really good and the staff are very nice. I have 0 complaints about the atmosphere or anything of the sort. The food is mediocre at best. The Tuna tostada was pretty overloaded with a chipotle mayo. The guac, super salty. But again- were in Canada. I would definitely come for a drink but not to eat."}
{"text":"5-star service, 2-star food and 1-star value make me give Native Tongues Taqueria a 2.5 star rating (I'm rounding down because I don't think it warrants a revisit).  On a very busy Taco Tuesday ($2.50 tacos) we waited for about 30mins to get a table for five.  Once seated the place was quite inviting and warm despite the crowded feel (I was elbowed a few times by the person behind me).  The open style kitchen was a nice touch as well.  The bar looked well stocked and as it should be since this is where they make most of their $$$ (more on that later).  The service was impeccable and even though our server got one drink wrong (it was quite loud so she mis-heard) she quickly corrected it with the right drink.  Food here was just \"OK\"... nothing to write home about.  I've had better tacos at food trucks or mom & pop taquerias.  However, $2.50 tacos aren't that bad of a deal if that's all you decide to order.  Even then, the pork tacos were a bit too salty, the beef tongue was bland and the chicken was dry.  The mushroom tacos were the best.. but they were mushrooms; salt and cheese them up and it's hard to mess up.  The tacos were also soggy and the beef tongue created a drippy mess on my plate.  The 1-star value comes from the fact that we paid:  $13 for a Caesar (if I knew I was going to pay that much I would've just ordered Mezcal) $13 for a meager amount of chips and a small cup of guacamole. $5 for a doughnut (despite my unwillingness my wife wanted to try it)  If you ever decide to go here expect to pay a lot for drinks and appetizers.  Stick to the tacos and you'll be fine.... even a week later I'm kicking myself for paying $5 for a doughnut.  Native Tongues Taqueria exemplifies all that is wrong with Calgary's dining and drink scene.  Hire young, beautiful people, design a visually stunning dining area, call it something cool, overcharge for drinks and food.  To me this isn't a way to build a following and repeat business.  This is really just a cash cow that will last a few years until everyone that thought they wanted to go here will go.  No offence to Native Tongues or any of the other restaurants in the BMeX restaurant group.  I get it, you're here to make money.  I just feel like my money is better spent elsewhere where I will get more."}
{"text":"This place opened on Canada day. It is a great little place with delicious Mexican fare. We went here with a group of 4 so we could try many things. Starting with drinks, the Abuela Rosalia was an amazing concoction with great balance. The Bam Bam Dilla is also quite fun with a great nutty taste. The house made guacamole was very fresh and bright with a good hit of spicy using fresh peppers. The braised corn was warming and had a great balance between savoury and acidic. The corn on the cob was very fresh and the queso on top elevated it as a great appetizer. The cactus salad was refreshing and delicious. We tried the lengua tacos and mushroom tacos and they were extremely satisfying as they were packed with flavour. For our main taco dishes, we had the stewed lamb neck and grilled octopus. The lamb neck was extremely tender and juicy. The broth it can in was probably the highlight of the meal. The octopus was equally satisfying and it was very tender. To cap off the meal, the tres leches cake was a great finish. Soaked in horchata, it was still light and provided closure without making you feel like you over ate. As a side note, the food could have had more of a spicy kick but I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I came here once on the recommendation of a co-worker, and now I make sure to stop by for HH every time I'm in town. I LOVE the mezcalgarita. LOVE. If you enjoy spicy margaritas, this is the drink for you. Taco Tuesday is where it's at-- $2 tacos! Grab one of the donuts on your way out. They make them fresh right there in the taqueria."}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times and loved it each time. Food is excellent and service is great. It is noisy so be prepared for that!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Tacos are amazing! Wonderful place to get sharesy with a friend and taste a few items. And the choices of tequila?! Oh my!! Great food, drink and service. My only critique was that our reso was lost and we ended up at the bar (no biggy - just hard to hear one another) and a couple of the dishes needed salt. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Place was crazy crowded, so was excited to try.  It was taco Tuesday.  Started off the a margarita and chips/guacamole.  Both were excellent.  Then had a pork, chorizo and brisket taco.  Loved all three, but the port was my favorite.    1) service: was very crowded, but never waited for anything.  Just fantastic  2) cleanliness: place was super clean with tables wipes down and not sticky menus.  Sounds terrible to mention, but it happens way too often.   3) ambiance: so warm and inviting.  Loved it  4) food:  everything was fantastic.    Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, but always a huge wait, and probably about 2 times more expensive (and pretentious) than Mexican food should be."}
{"text":"Having lived in Mexico for years with a partner who is Mexican, I know what it takes to make a good taco.  Lime, cilantro, onions, queso fresco and pico de gallo.  They've got it going on here.  We really enjoyed the entire experience.  Sadly, our tamale arrived cold in the middle...ah, nothing's perfect.  The beans and tacos were wonderful accompanied by Negra Modelo.  The service was great.  A fun experience.  This is pretty close to going out to a taqueria in Mexico with all the commotion, conversation and food.  Good times."}
{"text":"This place is delicious, what is there to say? Try to get there before the lunch rush because this place is packed! They have very flavourful vegetarian tacos and the donuts are to die for."}
{"text":"I'm really happy with my experience here. It was taco Tuesday and the place was packed wall to wall but we got seated right away (2 people). Order the brisket, veggie, pork and chorizo tacos ($2.50 on Tuesday's) and I wasn't disappointed.   Even though it was quite busy, we still had excellent service. I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"4.5/5 The tacos here were excellent! We came on a Tuesday so it was 2.50 tacos and I enjoyed all the ones I tried.   I had carnitas  (pork) which came with cilantro and onions... along with all the salsa/hot sauces it was delicious! The beef tacos were juicy and the one of my favourites  the chicken taco tasted good but I found it quite dry. It came with pickled onions that I wish were also on the pork ..... that would have been perfect! Lastly I had a couple hongos  (mushroom) and they were my favourite! I am a mushroom lover so these were right up my alley... with a bit of feta and the hot sauces they provide these were little bundles of heaven!  If you're willing to spend an extra 2.25, get a side of the habanero hot sauce.... not super spicy but creamy and delicious!  Service was excellent and friendly... the drinks were a bit slow, but everything else including out waitress was great! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was in town with a friend and came here because we were craving Mexican. There was a wait (this place was packed), but unfortunately we were less than impressed when we finally ate. It is Mexican food with a hipster/trendy spin and quite expensive at that. The guacamole was good. We got the chicken tostada and it was cold? Tasty, but cold... we each got 3 tacos. The bean and the pork were pretty good. The chicken and the chorizo had very weird spices/tastes (the chicken tasted like it had cinnamon or allspice added?) and neither of us ate either one after a bite of each (trust me, I'm not a picky eater and rarely leave food on my plate). All in all, our server was great but we would have like to spend our time/calories elsewhere."}
{"text":"Roses are red, violets are blue, Thom with an h you slayed it.  Thank-you for promoting our alcohol abuse with your freshly squeezed lime juice. Also, shout out to the homeboy on lime juice duty. You are one steezy piece of eye candy.     Also, for all of you barstars, make sure to note my girl Alanna's blind contour drawing of Thom. *Coming to Moma*"}
{"text":"the tacos are so speedy fast, it actually worries me!  they will come at lightening speed right after you order.  it makes me wonder... lol  but flavor is there! size wise, they're on the tinier side.  native tongues has a variety of things on the menu so if you're only there for tacos, it's a bit of a limited selection.  other things like guac and street corn were alright.  nothing super outstanding.  i enjoyed the donut which the waiter raved about but if only it was fresh and warm... knowing that it's been sitting on the counter the whole entire night didn't help my appetite.  so yea~ i enjoyed my dinner here sipping my beer and all, but i was quite surprised what the bill came out to..  anyway, i might just be a picky eater since i feel that i had better tacos at a much more reasonable price else where.  i suppose native tongues is a bit of a trendy spot, but in summary, i don't think it's worth waiting for."}
{"text":"Okay they have the best pork belly tacos I've ever had. Easily one of my favourites in Calgary and their corn was amazing too! We tried their normal tacos and those were good too but it was the pork belly tacos that blew us away. The wait was long so we grabbed drinks nearby so keep that in mind if you go on a Friday or Saturday. Already craving this place again!!!!"}
{"text":"TACOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and more tacos.. but then MORE tacos!!!! My husband and I went to Native Tongues on Saturday, and this was my THIRD VISIT, I cannot get enough.  Some things to note:  They DO not take reservations, they are VERY busy (but hella worth the wait) and they're amazing. We ordered some salsa tasters to start:  comes with 5 salsas: a creama, an ashy one, peanuts in chili oil, a pico de gaio, and a green one.  All amazing.  My favourite is the creama mixed with any of them. Then because we weren't super starved we had three delicious tacos each.  a pork, chicken and refried bean (frijoles? I'm so sorry).  It was the perfect amount of food, I wish I'd made room for their tres leches cake or donut! The service has been consistently incredible here.  Water always filled, food brought out fast.  Unreal place.  Native Tongues is located on 12th avenue next to the BELTLINER.  Come check it out this summer and experience the TACO COMAAAAA"}
{"text":"The decor was fun and the staff were nice. We tried 4 different cocktails which were interesting and pretty good, but a little expensive. The reason I'm giving 3/5 is because some of the tacos were WAY TOO SALTY. I tried 5 different tacos: chicken, beef, chorizo sausage, refried beans, and pork. The beef, chicken and bean tacos were really delicious, but the chorizo and pork were so incredibly salty it made it difficult to enjoy. For dessert we had a glazed donut and a shortbread coconut cookie and they were both delicious. Glad we ended on that! :)"}
{"text":"Great new addition to the mexican food scene in Calgary. They do not take reservations here, but if you come a bit before typical dinner timer or a bit later, then there isn't much of a wait. On sundays, you get 25% off the shared plates (not sure if it was a limited time discount but great for us). In regards to the food: we had very good cocktails and ordered the guacamole, pulpo, pescado, pork belly and pollo asado for a group of 6 to share. In general we found it hard to get good seafood in calgary, so the pulpo and pescado were so so. However, the pork belly was fantastic and the pollo was good. For desserts we tried the donut, tres leche and flan. The donut was a very very good donut, but I'm not sure about paying 5 dollars for a donut on a regular basis. The tres leche cake is not your typical tres leche cake and it was ok. The flan was a bit too salty/rich for our taste but I'm sure it works for others. Overall, good vibe, decent meat tacos."}
{"text":"After exploring downtown Calgary we were craving lunch, and we discovered Native Tongues located on 12 Street just north of the train tracks. Located beside a hotel, the place was basically a square box that featured a selection of tables that looked out onto the street. An open kitchen, and bar with a charcoal BBQ sat to the one side of the restaurant, while the place was decorated in a trendy, warehouse style with lots of string lights giving it the feel of a warehouse cantina. We sampled a selection of their tacos and their ceviche and everything was really delicious. The service was fast and attentive making for an enjoyable spot for a light lunch."}
{"text":"So much hype, Seriously the BEST TACOS in Calgary! The ingredients are so fresh and the hospitality is out of this world. Even when they are busy - which is basically always - this spot is still on point every time. The brisket tacos are to die for. Remember, one will not fill you and even after being full, you'll want to get another. I highly recommend this place !"}
{"text":"Loved the food - the mushroom tacos were amazing, and the guacamole is to die for. My friend had the empanada and said it was the best she has had in a long time. The ambiance is nice too. My only complaint is the inability to make a reservation because it's really busy and the wait is long."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh wholesome Mexican food suitably spiced for Canadian palates.  The lamb neck on the brunch menu can serve 3 and is melt off the bone to die for.  The soup spoons let me politely sip every drop of the lamb and ceviche dish as well."}
{"text":"Native Tongues is great spot with some amazing foods.  But crazy overpriced.  Definitely docking a star for that.  When a small teeny weeny taco is going for 3.95 it is time to find alternatives or just make them yourselves.  Each taco is about 3 bites... Maybe 4 if you're being really dainty.  Packed in right up next to other patrons, we ordered a brew and a few tacos.  We started with chilaquiles which was a happy hour special for 5 bucks.  They were packed with flavor, and a pretty generous portion.  In hind-sit, we should have each gotten one and waited for a deal on the Hongos, Frijoles, and Pollo Verde tacos.    We will go back to try some of the other options and look for better seating next time around, while also being on the lookout for a better deal.    Would definitely recommend but I just cannot give higher than a 3 star given the 'popular' overcharges that are being added."}
{"text":"Excellent food. My girlfriend and I were in from Vancouver and went there for dinner. The black bean tostada was very tasty. So were their tacos. Had the chicken and bean one. Might have to try the burger next time. It also looked really good. The donuts are outstanding. Definitely worth going back."}
{"text":"Great spot. Some of the best Mexican food I've had in Canada. The salsa tasting is worth trying. All are fantastic. Great service to boot. Oh and get a donut on the way out."}
{"text":"This place has only been open a few days and already I can feel that it will be a great success. The place was packed when we arrived just after 8pm and still had a decent crowd at 10:30 as we were leaving. Native Tongues is Mexican cuisine with a tapas style menu. We ordered a few different dishes such as the cactus salad (eh...not that flavorful or memorable for me but never had cactus before so atleast I can say I tried it!) beef tongue tacos (YUM- will order again),octopus tacos (I found the octupus to be a little dry and bland) and lamb neck stewed in an amazing broth (if you like lamb, then I recommend!).  Their corn tortillas are some of the freshest and best I've tasted.  Of course we ordered standard Mexican items such as their house guacamole (highly recommend) and corn on the cob (also recommend, smothered in a tangy sauce and queso fresco cheese).  The other great thing to note is the drink menu. Our friend Sam is the bar manager and designed the drink menu, her concoctions are very impressive. I ordered a drink that tasted like summer: The Abuela rosalia! Refreshing, fruity, but not a weak flimsy drink. You can tell the effort and meticulous combinations of ingredients that went into it...art in a cup. Service was great, and the ambiance is cool and hip. I will definitely go back to try other things on the menu! Room for improvement: as mentioned above, some menu items were bland, dry and did not make as big of an impact as other dishes. But I'm sure the menu will continue to evolve and looking forward trying more things!"}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos in Calgary.   We tried the brisket, chicken and chorizo tacos and with some guacamole and frijoles on the side. All really delicious, even the guac was pretty good. (I'm pretty particular about my guacamole.)     Service was fine, even though we went at the tail end of lunch on a week day.  It really cleared out fast after the lunch crowd.   Place looks like a Mexican restaurant inside with the rustic Mexican decor.   Definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"Great place, reminds me of a very authentic place back home in Jersey City.  Like everyone in Calgary, staff was great and the waiter was quick to recommend drinks and specials of the day.  landed on getting a bunch of tacos (tounge x 2, carnitas, and chorizo) and a carrot special (almost stole the show, great!  caramelized and dressed with some crema, yum!).  Great good at a great price, come thirsty as they have nice mezcal cocktails and well priced beers.  I moved into the neighborhood, I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Have you ever had your face melt off?   Well that won't happen at Native Tongue but you can certainly burn some tastebuds in a most enjoyable way. Er, wait, this is starting to sound like a flaming torture chamber for your mouth but I assure you it was aaaaallll pleasure from one dish to the next. And there were many great dishes to be had.  The menu prices are \"really good\" too, which means you can try a lot of food without spending a lot of money. We could have ordered the entire menu - which I was considering for a moment.  The ambiance/atmosphere is great for social gatherings, dates, foodie parties, and whatever dressy casual to business casual inspiration that hits you.    I should point out that they have a great cocktail bar too if you just want to stop in for drinks with your pal. Try the BAM BAM DILLA! You cannot go wrong with the cool cup they serve it in.   The Good:  - Ambiance and music selection - Cocktails - Taste extravaganza - Very cool decor - Awesome Staff   The Bad:  - Not much to say here other than it's hard to find a place to park anywhere in that area on a weekend night. I recommend you go early to find somewhere along 12th avenue SW.    Thanks Native Tongues!  We will be back - and in greater numbers!  Sincerely, Shane"}
{"text":"I travel to Calgary from the US for work once per month. I look forward to eating at Native Tongue each visit. The food is super fresh. Service is great. Only downside is the uncomfortable chairs."}
{"text":"This was a recommended restaurant. A must try they said. The Bootcamp Breakfast Club (BBC) checked it out last evening. We started with chips y guacamole which was delicious with the house made chips and guacamole dipping sauce. We followed with some beef, pork and refried beans tacos; also delicious. Our main course was pork belly and ribeye steak with tacos and french fries. For dessert, we had house made donuts and flam. The service was excellent even though we had to wait 45 minutes before being seated. No reservations; first come, first serve. When we got there, they took our name and suggested a nearby bar for drinks. They texted us when our table was ready. Very community minded! The critique is: way too much salt on the fries, someone was not paying attention; donuts were not fresh; tasted like day old donuts; difficult to put pieces of steak and pork belly on tacos. Overall, good food, excellent service and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"While expensive for a Mexican restaurant this place is so much more. The cocktail selection is an excellent, and is worth the trip alone. There's a large selection of meat based dishes and traditional fare, this place is fantastic for a quick business lunch, of course I highly recommend it for an intimate dinner with loved ones as well."}
{"text":"We love Native Tongues. Hard to find authentic style Spanish food in Calgary, but these guys nail it."}
{"text":"Happened to choose this spot on a Taco Tuesday. Great value and the food was authentic. Servers are excellent. Beware the margaritas are $13 each. This can be a surprise when you receive the bill.  The parting donut is delicious and a memorable touch."}
