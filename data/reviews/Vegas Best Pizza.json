{"text":"Checked this place out during a quick visit to Vegas.  Stayed next door at the Blue Green hotel. These guys have an awesome wood fired oven at their disposal.  Producing decent pizza should be a no-brainer.  Ordered one two top 16\", one 14\" two top and a 2lt coke, $30. Got back to the hotel and realized they left off one of the toppings.  Should not be hard to make a two topping pizza?  One bite and realized  I was eating a wood fired Totino's pizza. They use very cheap ingredients and do a mediocre job with the cooking.  The crust was actually okay. What a waste of a pizza oven."}
{"text":"Had the 14\" meat lovers for $12 and change with a veterans discount. If we stay at Bluegreen Club 36 in the future and want pizza, we'll go here again."}
{"text":"I don't know where some of these negative reviews are coming from. I think the pizza is real good, and you can get a large cheese for 10 bucks. Fair price and good pizza. The gyros are decent , but probably not for everyone.  They are not seasoned much, so I had to add my own spicy seasoning at home which helped."}
{"text":"I stopped in recently for lunch and was immediately disappointed when I spotted the drink cooler....another place that doesn't have a soda fountain.  Oh well, I'm here aren't I?  How about a gyro!  Yum!  My order took about 10 minutes and this gave me a chance to push the thought of baby sheep out of my mind so I could mentally prepare to really enjoy this hot and cool savory treat.  I thought that once you've had a gyro you've had them all.  Not so.  The Tzatziki sauce was off a little, not much cucumber taste and sort of a weird consistency.  The meat was rather bland, not what I am used to.  Most gyro shops feature meat by Kronos...this is why I think gyros are generally consistent from one place to the next.  I don't know what went wrong here but it wasn't quite right.  I didn't see where the meat came from but I'm guessing it wasn't on a rotating spit.  The pita, however, was good and I assume it was heated in the wood fired oven.  Finally, no lettuce :(  Also, as a heads up, the seating is very limited.  There is one table with 4 chairs and 4 other stools at the counter, that's it.  I'll give it one more shot and try a pizza next time."}
{"text":"The best pizza with pineapple and olives  Lovely staff .sign ur name on the chalk board"}
{"text":"The location was convenient because we were staying at the bluegreen 36 resort in the same complex. The pizza was really good but a bit on the expensive side. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Watch your receipt, my wife and I picked picked up a pizza for the family during a March trip, the price was $24.20.  When we got back from our trip we found out we had been charged $242.00.  So we contacted Kevin the manager and he said he would refund the mistake.  Unfortunately he didn't and now we can't get hold of him, so be careful."}
{"text":"This is a little embarrassing to admit, but within 2 days my husband and I order three pizzas from this place. The pizzas were all delicious!!!! They are cooked in a wood burning fireplace and perfect crusted around the rim and I love the thin crust. Hands down this place is great! To top it off, they had great customer service and offered us a 20% discount because my husband is a vet."}
{"text":"The pizza was over all, ok. The crust was soggy and a little hard to pick up but the toppings were good. Not what I would choose normally but it did good after a long flight in and being tired. I would buy another pizza from here."}
{"text":"Friendly service & impressive wood-burning oven. However, food quality was average, at best. I'd say their pizza toppings, sauce & cheese are on par with Cici's Pizza."}
{"text":"Not half bad. Don't know why reviews are so negative. I thought it was pretty solid pizza for being next to a hotel and hookah lounge."}
{"text":"LOVE this place, get a slice for only $1.50!!! Great family owned pizza joint where you'll feel welcomed by the owner himself! The wood fire pizza is the BEST pizza I've had in years, and I've eaten pizza at hundreds of pizza joints... it's my fav food group! Everything is made when you order totally fresh, let the taste do the talkin!  Not to mention you can get a slice for only $1.50.... even better!!!! Hope to see them in Phoenix one day!"}
{"text":"New ownership... great, friendly environment. Love the wood fired taste and I really LOVE the wood fired Chocolate chip cookies!!"}
{"text":"Ok so if you're reading the reviews it's because you want to know if the food is good right? It's terrible!!! If you're a foodie or at least know what good pizza tastes like, then don't even bother with this one.  Just cuz it's wood fired, doesn't make it good. Crust/dough is soul-less no character or flavor (frozen from food distributor probably.) toppings are not high quality I.M.O. & the cheese is rubbery & flavorless. I got a house salad also & its nothing special at all, totally stock & they charge $5 for it?!?  Absurdly overpriced for the level of quality IMO. I will never buy anything from here or eat their food (even for free) ever again. Even Dominoes would be better.  If this really is \"Vegas Best\" then that's a shame.  Service is friendly though."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza and the guy working there was super friendly. If he wasn't the owner ,he sure treats the place like his own and is passionate about his job. Excellent customer service and fast."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza. Gave us a medium pizza in a large box.  Pizza itself wasn't great either. Pricey for what we got. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"If you are in Las Vegas and want to eat the best pizza from the west coast you have to visit Place amazing taste excellent price I can eat it every day that's how good it is. They also have some wings"}
{"text":"I love that they say this was voted best by taxi and limo drivers. People, if I may try to save my own reputation as a limo driver. No such survey or ballot for best pizza has ever been given to taxi and limo drivers. Yes, this place stays in business because of the timeshare and that is a fact. I did want to share this picture I took this morning as I walked by the front door before they opened. I found it quite funny and very true. It is added to the pictures. It's the one with the pizza slice box in the handles of the door. (I've been informed that the owners requested the picture removed from Yelp. I guess the truth hurts)."}
{"text":"Best pizza let the pie do the talking!"}
{"text":"Uh...wow. Yeah. Las Vegas BEST? Honestly, I'm from outta town and this is the only Vegas pizza I've had. BUT - I'd like to taste somethin that will beat it. It's GOOD!  Going in on a cool desert night the smell and warmth of the wood oven is cozy and comforting. The greasy but tasty meat lover pizza continues the comfort.  Mmmmmm goooooood!"}
{"text":"Having an early evening flight and not wanting to eat an overpriced food court dinner, I stopped here enroute to to the airport thinking a slice would hit the spot. With signs saying \"wood fired\" all over the windows, I was unpleasantly surprised to walk in to a counter with a heated case of slices and one lonely chair.  Menu didn't have anything on it but pizza, despite the photos on the door of wings and salad. Got two sad slices, popped straight in the box and not crisped in the oven or anything, but as soon as I went to eat them I realized they were coated in grease. Like, an obscene amount puddled on the surface. Took a few bites, tried to blot what I could, tossed the majority of my $8 meal. I think not."}
{"text":"Great carry out pizza! Fast and friendly. Generous toppings that uses fresh mushrooms! Thin crust, wood fired. Can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"Delicious huge slices for affordable prices, the combo is a great deal. Very friendly service, 6 bucks for 2 slices and a drink lunch special, tasty pizza was just what I needed to put in my belly. It was fresh out the oven, cooked to perfection and very flavorful. If you want real wood fire brick oven pizza check out this place right behind the strip!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the crappiest pizza I've ever had. I've lived & traveled all over, so I've had a lot of pizza, but this takes the pie! The only thing they had going for them was the wood burning oven. Even then the pizza wasn't hot, there was barely any sauce, the cheese was bland, and the toppings were not fresh. I imagine it was about as satisfying as sex with a crying hooker or a lap dance from a crying stripper. Just terrible. If I could give it zero stars, I would. This is the place you take your out of town relatives to if you hate them, or that friend that won't stop crashing on your couch. Pretty certain a street dog would snub it's nose at it. Save your money, you're better off eating somewhere else."}
{"text":"If you're going to claim you're the best then you should have the best ingredients ever.  We got the combo and while the pizza was ok, the sausage was absolutely nasty and basically ruined the whole pizza, even after taking all the sausage off.  It actually tasted rotten. We paid more for this one pizza than we paid for the station casino buffet  with tip!!!! That guy needs to get Robert Irvine over there!!! Pretty sad that the Tropicana is just a few blocks away where Robert Irvine does his Heating Up The Kitchen but this guy is getting away with serving crappy pizza.  Pretty sad taking advantage of people that are at Bluegreen"}
{"text":"Stayed at the Bluegreen and decided to give this place a shot because it was close. Ordered a 14 inch half cheese and half pepperoni n black olives. It was delicious and made fresh right in front of us. The pizza all around had great flavor from the wood Oven and the crust was amazing. I'm glad we tried it out just wish I   Was hungrier so I could have tried the white pizza or salad. The staff was very friendly and we will definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Quick and tasty. Wood-fired but not like New York pizza so don't get your hopes up.  They deliver to the guests at Blue Green but thats all.  I think they could put a little more toppings on the pizza and sauce because it was actually a very bland pizza and I think I ordered their \"special\". But hunger is the best seasoning so it was fine!"}
{"text":"I just happened to pass by here on my long drive back to LAX.  I saw the sign which read \"wood fired pizza\".  Thinking that this would mean that this place would have nice thin and crusty pizza, I drove in to get some for my drive.  Surprisingly, they sold the pizza by the slice.  Most wood fired brick oven pizzas are sold by the mini-pie.  I asked for a slice and the gentleman behind the counter took a slice off of the heating cabinet and gave it to me.  I thought that was odd (I would have expected it to be placed into the oven to be heated).  I picked up the slice and immediately felt the droop of it.  The slice was just warm but more importantly, it was socking wet.  I gave it back to the guy and asked him to put it into the oven and make it extra crispy.  He did so and put it on a cookie sheet and put it into the oven.  3 minutes later he took it out of the oven and gave it back to me.  Now the slice was hot but the same drooping mess.    WOOD FIRED pizza should be crispy on the bottom and the crust - not wet on the bottom, droopy and a doughy \"crust\".  Normally, it should be thin and crispy and served fresh.  This pizza is thick - like stuff I would get in a supermarket frozen department.  I also ordered with this slice a Gyro.  I didn't think that gyros differed much from place to place but this was a semi-disaster too.  Unlike the pizza slice, this was much dryer.  There wasn't that much tsatziki yogurt sauce and more importantly, no lettuce at all.  It had 2 half slices of Tomato, some onions and of course the lamb but it felt half full.  Anywhere you go in LA and NY (where I'm from), Gyros are usually stuffed, lots of lettuce, tomato and yogurt sauce.  This felt like an imitation gyro in my opinion.  I hate to leave negative reviews but this place I couldn't find anything good about it. The place looked nice but unfortunately, the food was not."}
{"text":"Surprisingly solid pizza....a nice amount of decent quality cheese, wood fired, fairly yummy.  A little too much soft crust for my taste, but not a deal breaker.    $2.50 for a pepperoni slice, not a bad price. I'd come here again for a pizza craving."}
{"text":"Wow, worse than your typical school cafeteria cardboard pizza. First time using Uber eats and they were suggested with a rating of 4.2, which was a complete lie because the pizza was gross. Extremely thin, but not in a good way, soggy, cold, super scarce toppings/cheese/sauce. How is this place still in business?!? Apparently by buying their 4.2 star review on Uber eats. Consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I ever had!! The staff was amazing and service was second to none. If your ever by the strip this is it. The price for what you get is unbelievable. Definitely coming back here over and over. They also have great gyros and wings"}
{"text":"We were staying at Club 36 next door and ordered pizza. It tasted like grocery store frozen, not wood fired and was pricey.  Staff was pretty rude to boot. Pass on it!"}
{"text":"This pizza place is in the same parking lot as the Bluegreen Resort.  I actually first noticed its presence when the BF and I walked into our hotel room and smelled smoke.  I immediately worried that the room was on fire somehow, the smoke smell was so strong.  Walking downstairs, hoping for some cheap lunch somewhere, the smell got stronger right outside and we realized the smoke smell was actually from the wood burning pizza place.  We were hoping to get away with a \"cheap\" lunch, which in Vegas doesn't actually mean cheap.  The pizza smelled so good that we decided hopping in the car wasn't necessary and we stopped in here instead.  We were pleasantly surprised to get out of here for only $6 or so dollars each, with 2 really great slices of pizza per person.    4 stars for being really delicious (the wood-fired flavor truly came through perfectly) and 4 stars for being cheap.  Sure, it's out of the way for most people on the strip, but if you're in the area, and want some good pizza, stop here.  The Boyfriend loved it so much that he literally kept bugging me to write this Yelp review to say how good it was, so, case and point.  The only thing that bugged me was that the only pizza-by-the-slice they had at the moment was cheese and pepperoni.  Would've loved a slice of veggie!"}
{"text":"Really nice chill Pizza prices are on point the boss hooked us up. Wait time wasn't long at all."}
{"text":"Was on my way to a different place for lunch when I stumbled upon this little place. Couldn't been more satisfied, excellent gyro, great price. The best customer service around."}
{"text":"This place is horrible!! My pizza was raw and soggy in the center. I ordered Hawaiian, be forewarned Hawaiian includes mushroom for some reason? I've ordered lots of Hawaiian Pizzas in my time and nobody has ever used mushroom. It wouldn't be such a huge deal if I didn't HATE mushrooms lol. Just a bad experience overall. The dude working there was really nice but unfortunately that didn't outweigh the crappy pizza :( sorry but BOOOOOO!!!"}
{"text":"Staying at blue-green this week and decided to try this place.  The staff is friendly and they bake the pizza in a wood burning oven. I'm a pizza lover like the ninja turtles and prefer deep dish, however this pizza was really good so I didn't mind the thin crust.  Jake enjoyed it, Jason loved it, and wife wanted more...I recommend this place  to everyone ..cheers!"}
{"text":"Food was so so. Clearly the name Vegas Best pizza is just a name. It is attached to the building I was staying at in Vegas for the week. I got in late and it was still open so it was option out of convenience.  I ordered two slices of pizza and a order of fries. That came up to 12 bucks and change. The pizza was ok nothing bad about it but wasn't anywhere close the the best.  The slices were very small and not worth the 3.50 they charged.  The fried were absolutely terrible.  Some were burnt while others were not even close to being done. I am not sure now that works. I tried to force down a few but ended up throwing the whole order out. I won't be coming back here even if nothing else is open."}
{"text":"It was there... I saw the lackluster reviews but I was hungry...I wished I had saved my calories for something way better. I have a feeling they stay in business because of the time share club above them...doughy and no gourmet wood fired at all.  Small place, not ventilated well- take it to go. Overpriced for the quality. No place to sit   The second star is just because the pizza was nice even though he was stuck in this marinara sinkhole of a location."}
{"text":"I just got back to Vegas, and only wanted a pizza slice of pizza as soon as I got back from the cold Northwest.     Pizza really sucks on the Love Boat, and anywhere that has some snow on the mountain, and this was the nearest pizza joint near the airport that I actually enjoy.  It's a hop, skip, and jump from the Thomas and Mack, and I was turning into this hole in the wall that's neighbor with the Grind burger bar.    Their stereo was playing Prince's Kiss, and the Television monitors showing the NBA semi-finals;  I thought it was a very unique and cool spot for food, but I just wanted a couple of slices, and  get back home to visit my bed.  The crew just took out a cheese pizza, and had a couple of slices of BBQ chicken sitting in the warmer.     I'm not a big fan of BBQ chicken pizza, but this one looked good, and rocked my taste buds.   OMG, this is one pizza that can sit in around, and get better, and at  $2.25 for that slice it was totally cheap.      As for the pepperoni, it was the same as my other review of them, and I got a little more sauce on it.    I have to admit, there is one major downfall for this place, because there is no direct turn to the Bluegreen resort from the strip, and you have to drive another quarter mile east on Tropicana to make a U-turn to get here.    It's not a problem if you're driving west on Tropicana.    To the owners, your name might be right, and you should be thinking about making another location on the strip."}
{"text":"I like the pizza but if you don't like it thin it might not be for you. The salads could be improved. I stopped going because I felt like I had to beg for my advertised discount every time. At some point I just think \"This is the 4th time I've been here this week. Do I really need to remind you AGAIN?\""}
{"text":"Such good food, quick service, and friendly staff. I wish that I could take them back to California with me! The prices are also very affordable, it's worth just getting a whole pizza and save some money by eating off the Vegas strip."}
{"text":"My husband and I got the lasagna special and the Hawaiian pizza!!! We loved them both,  the prices were way better than anything on the strip. Friendly staff. We could really taste the wood fired flavors in the crust.  :)"}
{"text":"After a long flight from Chicago, we were famished. Staying at the BlueGreen and being jet lagged we were too tired to go anywhere far. We ordered the special with a pizza, salad, wings and a 2-liter. I expected the most mediocre pizza imaginable from such a nondescript place but instead, I was pleasantly surprised with how delicious this meal was! The salad was so fresh and the pizza was as perfect as a pepperoni pizza could be. The wings were a bit burned, to be honest, but they were still delicious! My wife and I were starving and afterwards, we were full and totally satisfied!"}
{"text":"We're staying at a hotel 0.2 miles away and delivery took 1 hour, we ordered at 11. The pizza was good, would have been better if it were warmer. The wings were salty. We ordered a special that came with pizza, wings, and a soda that was supposed to be 24$ but we were charged 34$, unfortunately I didn't realize this until after I paid."}
{"text":"Finally came back to vegas!!!!! And again I had to come into vegas best pizza, I love coming to this spot every time I come to vegas. I've truly never had better pizza then this. I recently moved to Los Angeles and I don't know of any place for pizza as good as vegas best pizza. It Really is Wood Fire pizza  and it really is tasty!! If you don't visit vegas best pizza when coming to this wonderful city you are missing out on great tasting food."}
{"text":"Pizza wasn't the best. Coming from Chicago may make me biased. But oh gosh, a frozen pizza is better. This only gets 3 stars because the wings were pretty good.   The pizza toppings were average, the sausage and dough both tasted freezer burnt. Cheese and mushrooms were decent.  Sorry, but $1 for a little dipping cup of sauce is crazy.  The service wasn't the best, but it wasn't bad. Considering this place? Take your money to Walmart and buy a frozen pizza. Same thing but cheaper."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to eating here again after staying at the BlueGreen Resort last year. It was called Due Pizzeria before, so when I noticed the name change I knew it probably wasn't going to be as amazing as it was before. I was right.  If you're staying at the resort it's extremely convenient because they're right down stairs and they'll even deliver to your room for free. Other than the convenience, I'd pass. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't horrible pizza, but it also wasn't what it was, or the best we've had. It was a bit on the pricey side as well. The pizza itself was VERY greasy and the pepperoni was a little on the bland side. The dough, which was the best part of the old owner's recipe was lacking flavor. The wood fire helped the pizza have any kind of great flavor. Otherwise it was basically just a regular pizza. Again, nothing to get excited about. The only good thing was they do have different options from pizza, like wings and salad.   We were so disappointed that Due Pizzeria was gone. Like I said, other than convenience if you're staying at the resort, we'll pass it up from now on.  What a shame. DUE PIZZERIA, COME BACK!!!!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of the name, pizza should speak for itself, not be pre-determined by the name, but I have come here several times, and the pizza is ok.  Place is small and cozy, few places to sit, geared toward take-out, but it does give off a warm feel, and I've always found those behind the counter pleasant and sincere.  So is it the best pizza I've ever tasted, in Vegas or elsewhere?  Well, no, but it makes for a solid meal."}
{"text":"Got at 16 inch cheese pizza half with garlic to go for the ride back home. Friendly and fast service. Price is very fair. Pizza was delicious. Crust was nice and crispy, definitely hit the spot. I'll be back next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, when you walk in and smell a read wood fire burning oven - you know that freedom runs through this place. Best pizza - period."}
{"text":"Not too bad. We got mild wings, cheese pizza, salad and cheese bread.  Wings were really good.  The pizza was good but could have been cooked a little longer or hotter. The salad was the biggest surprise. Fresh hand cut romaine, green peppers, red onions and tomatoes with cheese,  black olives and marinated artichokes."}
{"text":"Late night hungry got us to this spot, off tropicana - Big Pizza sign  Its a OK Pizza spot, bit pricy for the size and for what you get. Not a spot much to right home about, avg pizza joint - not super clean either - more a take away"}
{"text":"Starting with the bad customer service and ending with the watery, mush they call lasagna, I give this place one star. Everything tastes like it's frozen and reheated. The prices are outrageous for what it is. I should have gone with my first instinct when I thought it looked dirty inside and ran away fast!"}
{"text":"I was never a pizza fan but I can assure you that i became addicted after tasting the pizza at Vegas best pizza, and the chicken wings are just so yummy."}
{"text":"If you are staying at BlueGreen, you will likely end up eating pizza here one night.  We ordered the hot chicken wings and were pleased.    There was plenty of meat and seasoned just right.   We also ordered a sausage and pepper pizza.    Toppings were generous and the wood fired crust was great.  Disappointing that there are only a few stools inside as I would have loved to eat somewhere other than my room.  They have lasagna on their menu sometimes but it really is a pizza parlor.     Would return"}
{"text":"Terribly rude customer service. Large menu board displays innacurate information. Food quality is mediocre.   Boyfriend and I order 14\" pizza with pepperoni, artichoke, roasted pepper and roasted garlic (directly off large menu board) and cheesy bread with a 2 liter soda.  The girl that took our order missed a topping while ringing us up while the gentleman (owner?) was making pizzas right next to her didnt bother to mention to us that they were out of roasted pepper and garlic even though we sat in the store waiting for our food less than 10ft away from them. When we got our pizza it was just pepperoni and artichoke with \"garlic seasoning\". Very bland. The sauce is watered down with overpowering basil/ oregano/ italian seasoning flavoring.   When we called the store to tell them our order was wrong, the owner tried justifying it by blaming us for ordering off 'the wrong menu'. If you see customers ordering based off your incorrect menu board instead of your paper menu why wouldn't you alert them? If theyre sitting in your store while you're making their food why wouldnt you let them know you're out of a topping and ask to replace it? After arguing for 10mins over the phone about our incorrect order he then proceeds to tell us to return the pizza for a refund since we were so dissatisfied, which is illegal due to risk of contamination once consumer has touched the food, but fine.   Cheesy bread is just a small single pita bread sprinkled with mozzarella and italian seasoning on top. Its shit, dont waste your money on it.   If a customer is dissatisfied with their order, YOU DO NOT TELL THEM THEY'RE WRONG. PERIOD. Basic customer service rule. Had they communicated what was missing/ being replaced, this wouldn't be an issue. Hopefully this establishment steps their game up because this was a pathetic and disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Their wings are to die for... we always get their wings and are always satisfied...have been here more than ten times and the food is always good..tried their pizza last time and it was really yummy...really recommend to anyone looking for yummy wings.."}
{"text":"I was super depressed by my latest experience here. I had been to Vegas in July '10...  It was right after Due became Vegas Best.... There was a handsome gentleman with amazing customer service named Jason. My BF only likes Salami pizza ONLY! Jason said if we brought it in he'd put it on. Sure enough kept his word. He made a pizza that was so amazing that BF and I KILLED THE WHOLE PIZZA within 15mins of getting it back to the room. It was the best pizza I've ever had! We went back the next day ordered a bigger pizza hoping for leftovers. Yeah didn't happen. Even got one for the road!   I went back after singing the praises of this place... Dreaming of this amazing pizza! I was greeted by 2 creepy looking guys who were rude at best. As for the pizza.... Well my mama always told  if you can't say anything nice don't say anything at all....    JASON WE MISS YOU!!! Where ever you ended up Message ME Let me know!"}
{"text":"Got a pizza and cheesy garlic bread at 245am on a Thursday after a hard day of putting in time, and getting abused by, the table games in Vegas. This has probably been the best decision I've made in Vegas. Everything was phenomenal. I'd highly recommend this place, it'll make you feel a little better about getting all of your money legally stolen by the tables around here."}
{"text":"It's a waste of money the toppings roll off onto your plate or even the floor because they hardly use any sauce or cheese there's nothing there to hold it onto the pizza next time I go to Domino's or Pizza Hut it's not worth the money even though they say they're voted number one from limo and cab drivers I think it's just a sign they made up"}
{"text":"I love this place!  While it's small on the inside,  the pizza is delicious!  It was made fresh and in the wood stove.  One of my favorite inexpensive pizza places. Much better than typical takeout pizza. The staff is also very nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked wood fired Pizza at an unbelievable price.  Best value if you ask me.  Everything is made fresh right in front of you.  Close to real NYC Pizza.  It's attached to the bluegreen club 36 condos."}
{"text":"Flattest pizza I've had in a long time... I've seen flat breads thicker. It tasted like pizza, and the wood fired wings were good... Not sure I'd call it a pizza place."}
{"text":"Went here last night based on the name and the location. Ordered 2 slices of just plain cheese pizza. The name is not true to the taste! This has to be the worst pizza I've ever had. Bland, greasy and hard. So disappointed. How do you mess up pizza??"}
{"text":"Horrible.  If your staying at the BlueGreen, get your pizza from the Burger Grind instead."}
{"text":"I feel bad giving these guys two stars and will go back a second time. My visit was possibly on a busy night for the staff and the slices may have sat for a bit...they were okay, but not great. I'll come back again..."}
