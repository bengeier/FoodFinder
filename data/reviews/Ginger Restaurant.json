{"text":"I was here once. Got tofu with noodles dish. I didnt know vietnamese food could be so greasy! WTF? I guess for like 6 dollars I cant complain. I mean, it was good, not great, but too greasy for my sensitive stomach. 

My fiance has no probs with grease, in fact, he loves it; and he loved his food. His meats were really shiny--it scared me kinda.
 
The fried veggie roll was tasty, but super greasy. I mean, in a weird greasy kind of way not in the way that all fried food is greasy. 

Cant explain it. You'll just have to find out for yourself."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch one month ago.  There are many choices of meal on menu. I ordered the rice noodle soup with rare beef, which was sent to my table very quick. The noodle soup is large and delicious and is not expensive at all. One drawback might be that the number of seats is less (about 30) so you have to wait or sit with strangers in the rush hours. Recommend for those people who are hungry with limited budget."}
{"text":"Not the greatest experience. It's not that clean and the ingredients are not overly fresh. My wife has a food allergy to sesame and we asked the cashier repeatedly if the dishes we ordered contained sesame before ordering and she still had an allergic reaction. It's convenient and in a great location but don't come here expecting to be wowed."}
{"text":"If you want a decent filling meal for under $10, this is where you go

-The Pho soup is always great. 
-Sandwiches are filling
-spring rolls are crispy and greasy
-even the pad thai is enjoyable as long as you arent expecting a traditional pad thai (i actually like that it comes with alot of shredded vegetables to  mix in it as well)

if you come here,  dont have crazy expectations for these prices in a quick serve eatery like ginger

service is so fast and efficient"}
{"text":"This is a no frills / no nonsense kind of a place.  The food is CHEAP and tasty backed up with efficient service.  

I tried the chicken spring roll (rice batter which was different) and the pho (chicken hot and sour).  The size of the pho was generous and for $8, have no complaints about the place.

I have gone back a couple of times.  The taste of food being the driver rather than the price."}
{"text":"I have worked around here for a year and have passed by it every lunch hour because I thought it looked sketchy.. I finally went in, and I'm so glad I did! This place has awesome vegetarian selection, and the food is good and CHEAP! I could have saved so much money by eating here opposed to other crappy expensive places nearby! 

You can get a vegetarian tofu sub (or meat subs) for $4 - and they're huge and delicious! $1.50 for a spring roll or fresh roll (also have vegetarian versions), and $3.50 for a smoothie! If you're looking to eat a lot for cheap, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"best Ginger location in the city
fresh and fast, good place to grab a quick bite. but no one is rushing you out the door either. 
it is not fine dining by any means, very casual, think fast-food vietnamese .
love vermicelli, tofu pad thai , pho, sandwiches are good, coffee is yum, mango shake mmm
not the best for any of these things, but certainly great for the price, and quality is consistent."}
{"text":"It's fresh, cheap, fast and consistent.

I usually go here after a good workout and throw down chicken with black bean sauce, bok choy and rice / or beef. $9.

Get's me all my nutritional macro's

{"text":"This place is excellent for their portions and variety. They cater to everyone including vegetarians.  

You have the choice of viet noodles, vermicelli, rice dishes with curry or grilled beef, shrimp, chicken or pork, or a combination.  They also have chicken and beef subs ($3.50), fresh rolls ($1-2 each), spring rolls ($1-2 each), chicken mango salad,  fresh fruit shakes, juices, and beer.

The pho there is ok.  Not chinatown standards but filling and tasty.  They also have a hot and sour version that you can select.

You can add extra veggies to any dish for an extra $1.50.

At this place, you place your order, take a number, and take a seat. No tip is required as it is like a take-out place.

The food is tasty and filling but it isn't the best asian food i've ever had. The location is convenient and the food comes very quickly.  Price is also reasonable with a meal being around $7. 

I recommend this place and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of their pho.

The other dishes I have tried have been: \"Good\". Not great, certainly not bad. Just good.

Have the pho."}
{"text":"Ginger is Pho-cking delicious. 

Random find on a rainy, gray day after we had walked 800+ miles looking for a different joint. We gave up on the original place and boy, am I glad we did.

Ordered the #19 Pho ( rare beef) and two fried vegetable rolls ( sorry forgot the menu item number on the rolls), Vietnamese iced coffee and of course, an avocado shake.

All superb.

Bonus: a bit further down is John Fluevog for some shoe and boot eye-candy - the sales clerks were super-duper nice not weirdly pushy like some can be.

But mostly, GO TO GINGER and EAT PHO."}
{"text":"Had rare beef pho ($5.25) and spicy beef papaya salad ($3.85). The place is like a food court. But the service was really quick. The food was ok - not so good but I wouldn't say it was bad. You get what you paid for. This is a good place when you are a little hungry but not in a mood for a big lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This is a great place for some really cheap and tasty banh mi. Also, I was able to pick up some stray open wifi signals nearby if you want to check messages."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken pad thai through Uber Eats. 
This was by far the worst Pad Thai I've eaten ever.
Whoever made this - really did the bare minimum and just  called it pad thai. It was giant chunks of chicken thrown over some orange noodles and large amounts of what I can only call dry coleslaw on the side.

For $9 bucks - this was HORRIBLE!!! I don't think I'm ever going to venture out to Ginger or Uber Eats again."}
{"text":"I love it here. Being a starving student on a shoestring budget this place is perfect for me. 

Great prices for great food. I don't know how else to put it. 

As a heads up those, if you don't like cilantro you might not like it here. They tend to put it on everything."}
{"text":"Ginger serves fresh and high quality Vietnamese food. The service was very quick which is a huge plus point for lunch time crowds trying to catch a quick meal. The food was adequately seasoned and tasted nice. There is an entire station dedicated to all kinds Asian sauces so you can add to taste. The price to quantity ratio is the best in this neighborhood. I got #46 which had a grilled chicken breast, beef, and shrimp. Also had one of the best spring roll I had in a very long time. I will return just for that spring roll if not for the same combo again. They have free water."}
{"text":"Great flavor but tiny portions! Highly recommend the raw beef and beef balls pho. Too bad they lack hot chili peppers!"}
{"text":"Vivek asked about the lack of a Humourous Story on this review. The simple answer is there isn't one yet (perhaps because they raised the price of their domestic cans from $2.50-$3.50) but I hate to disappoint the CM so I'll just leave you with a somewhat related Mitch Hedberg quotation - \"Rice is delicious when you want 2000 of something\"."}
{"text":"I love pho, so I'm probably biased with this review.

The portion size was great for the price and location. This place really reminds me of backpacking in Asia on a student budget. The decor is nothing to write home about and last night, there were some flies in there (which is why I gave it a 3 star and not a 4) since it was so hot, but the rare beef pho was so good!

Here is what I look for in my pho: beef quality, soup base, and chewiness of noodles.

1. Rare beef - with just the right amount of fat, it was the best part of the meal! I wish there were more pieces in there.

2. Soup base - not the best, but decent. I've had ones with more depth of flavour

3. Noodles - quite chewy and there was a good amount for a large

Great place if you are on a budget and are looking for a fast, delicious meal. I love that's it's close to the subway station too!"}
{"text":"When ever I'm downtown, I eat at Ginger.  It's super cheap and SUPER yummy.   If you're looking for super fancy, this won't be your place, but if you're looking for some cheap, yummy vietnamese food, it's hard to beat this place.  I'd eat here every day if I could."}
{"text":"I came by on a Tuesday night to grab a quick bite to go before hitting the movies that night. I had the curry chicken pad thai and was pleasantly surprised given the review I've read here. The pad thai was on the sweeter side and at first I thought the portion was on the smaller side as well. However, the crunchy beansprouts and shredded cabbage really went well with the dish and they definitely did to skimp on the chicken.
A great choice if you are looking for something quick and easy to get to go. I definitely wouldn't suggest eating in because the place smells very strongly of bleach and cleaning agents whenever I'm there for some reason..."}
{"text":"Based on one visit.

Food & Presentation: I went with friends and had a sample of their dishes. I found the food to taste okay. The avocado and mango smoothies were made with the actual fruit, the avocado flavour did not taste as strong as I hoped. My friends who have less experience with Vietnamese food liked their dishes. This is a great place to eat in when on a budget.

Atmosphere & Service: The food was served at a very reasonable time from order. The wall painting of the shore is very soothing to look at. Their menu holds a lot of items. You go up to the register, order, pay first and then receive a number. You can sit in or get take-out.

Pricing: The pricing is very reasonable for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Sadly spent some money here on veg spring rolls and tofu  banh mi. The spring rolls (I wanted fresh, but got fried, oily monster) were piping hot and crispy. That's the best compliment I could give it. The banh mi was packed with fried tofu cubes oozing with more oiliness. There were some carrot shreds, cucumber slices, and raw onions in there, but this was not remotely a banh mi sandwich. No freshness. No bright flavors. Just sad."}
{"text":"Aweful, eat somewhere else.  I ordered pad thai with hot and sour chicken and it tasted like ketchup on noodles.  My girl ordered a papaya salad which came with shredded carrots on top instead of papaya.  The lady at the counter insisted the carrots were papaya.  Ridiculous.

The worst Vietnamese restaurant experience I've had in Toronto.

The food is cheap and even then you still don't get what you paid for..."}
{"text":"What can I say about Ginger? 

I feel like I'm writing a review for McDonalds or Timmy's because not much stands out besides the impatient cashier waiting to take my order. 

This Vietnamese fast food chain is speedy especially during the lunch rush (the line was out the door). Service is a little pushy and rude, clearly anxious to get everyone's order in before people leave. The food isn't great - the beef on my pho was not rare, and the coloring was dark brown instead of pink. The noodles were all stuck together and the soup base tastes of MSG. 

Besides their fast service, there's not much to praise. That said, there's plenty of fast options in the area with much better service and food. I would not line up again for this."}
{"text":"Fast, cheap, tasty, and if you get the vermicelli, the food is healthy too.

My go-to order is either a bowl of vermicelli noodles (which comes with a spring roll) or a tofu banh mi sandwich. If I'm really hungry, I'll add a fresh garden spring roll too. The other dishes I've tried at Ginger haven't been as tasty. I wouldn't recommend the pad thai here."}
{"text":"Tried the pho soup in small with a couple fresh rolls on the side. Everything was delicious. Usually when I order pho, I don't drink the soup, but this was so good, I had to!"}
{"text":"The soup was weak, meat was tough and the small is the smallest I've ever seen.   I used to come here twice a week when I was working in the area. 

Also they put in TONs of onions but none of the other garnishes such as lemon grass,bean sprouts or basil. 

The soup lacks flavour as if it was watered down."}
{"text":"Worst pho I've ever had. The soup was room temperature and it didn't have much flavour as well."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant on four separate occasions because I enjoyed the food that much, particularly the spring roll.  It is crispy and delicious like I have never tasted.  They use a rice wrapper for those sensitive to wheat.  I had the beef and chicken combo over rice twice--delicious.  I had the pad Thai, terrible.  I had the pho--not very good and they use cilantro instead of Asian basil.  That was such a let down.  Their pho is very popular as most customers ordered it.
This restaurant is no frills but the food comes out hot, well-cooked and fast. The cashiers always knew enough about the menu to discuss options and I appreciated their professionalism and efficiency.
I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ginger is an inexpensive, tasty viet-thai restaurant with fresh, tasty and hot food. 

Value for the dollar, this place is top notch. Meal and beer for under $10! Ginger has been a good cheap choice before a night out and I will definitely use it as place for a quick bite again in the future. 

Meals are viet-thai inspired, lots of rice, noodle with a protein and curry or sauce.   Everything is prepared fresh and served piping hot.  There is no table service - order at a counter and they bring it to your table."}
{"text":"Passed by and went here for some quick food. Pretty quick service, however it's mostly self-serve and less formal. You have to grab your own plastic utensils, sauces, napkins, and meal (so we didn't need to tip when we ordered and paid the cashier after we walked in). We weren't served tea, as most vietnamese restaurants do. I assume it's more of a take-out place (so I definitely wouldn't come here with a large party)!

Inside, the decor seemed a bit outdated and the circulation very poor, as it felt very humid and stuffy. I didn't feel any air conditioning. 

I ordered the vermicelli with spring roll and grilled chicken - very good and comparable to your above average vietnamese restaurant. Their prices are extremely well priced and reasonable. I would certainly come back here again if I'm in the area and wanted to grab quick, filling food for a fair price, in a casual environment."}
{"text":"Very good fast food and good prices. I love this place for asian fast food and spring rolls are yumm if u like the fried style."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now.  There's tons of selection on the menu so it's very easy to get lured into coming back.  I really like how basically every item on the menu has a picture that goes along with it, so you know what you're ordering.  The beef pho is excellent; the noodles are the perfect texture, the broth is delightfully aromatic, the price is very reasonable, and you can garnish your soup with a variety of hot sauces and finish it off with some lime wedges.  In contrast, the pad thai is not very good.  It tastes like it's made with ketchup/tomato sauce and not tamarind, which makes it taste like a 3rd grader prepared it.  One plus is that many of the items serve chopped peanuts and fresh, crispy bean sprouts in addition to the entree.  Take-out portions are rather small.  The restaurant isn't all that fancy, but if you're just looking for a cheap warm healthy bowl of pho for lunch I haven't found a better place in this area--yet."}
{"text":"I love love love love love ginger.

It's fast, convenient and delicious. The place to go when you're craving Viet food and want to be satisfied quickly. 

P.s. I love how they a mic for sending through orders lol"}
{"text":"Not the place to go for authentic vietnamese food. The atmosphere is more of a cafeteria style where you order your food at the counter and they bring it to you.  The service is really fast and its great for quick lunch/dinner. 
But the spring rolls are pricey, and they miss the 2 most important ingredients: mint and cucumbers!
The vermicelli noodles are mediocre. I would recommend their pho if you want the most vietnamese style food."}
{"text":"Twice I've been to Ginger. The first time, when they moved into the 'hood and I thought, \"Great! New Asian food.\" 
I was not impressed. White rice with a side of fried stuff seems to be the M.O. here. 
The soups contain terrible quality meats, but decent quality vegetables. 
Not much for either the vegetarian or fish eater that is healthy and fresh-tasting. 
I tried it again, just to be sure. I had to add soy, or chili, or lime sauces to have any flavour."}
{"text":"I came here twice during my 6-day stay at the nearby Hilton Hotel.  The food here was wonderful and the price was just unbeatable.  Service was very quick, one you ordered your food, you will get your food no more than 3 minutes.  They don't charge for water, but they do have a self serving water station where you can get your own water.  I didn't get to try their ice drinks, especially the coffee as I am already full after ordering their rare beef pho noodle large bowl.  Overall service and food were excellent."}
{"text":"I got the curry chicken with mixed vegetables.  I'll give them credit for their vegetables as they were super-fresh.  But the curry chicken was woefully under-seasoned.  And being that it was so bland, I only had use for about maybe 1/4 of the rice that was on the plate."}
{"text":"Ordered vegetarian banh mi. I was served an AHS nightmare on an oily, soppy bun. Do not go to this place if, oh I don't know, things like taste, texture, and Vietnamese cuisine are held in any regard by you. I'm sorry to be harsh, but what I was served was inedible. Look at the picture."}
{"text":"Don't expect fine dining. It's Vietnamese fast food but it's very tasty and very cheap.  
Been there twice and was thoroughly impressed by the quality of the food for the prices.  
Counter service is not overly effusive but it's very fast. 
The coconut tofu soup is sublime -- warm, spicy, sweet -- and the asparagus shitake soup was excellent as well.
Also, I loved the yam and avocado salad roll.  The yam was crispy fried with a little tempura coating, giving the roll an unexpected warm crunch.
Fresh banana and mango smooth was huge and tasty.

 All this plus tea and tip for fifteen dollars?  Perfect."}
{"text":"I usually come here for lunch about once a week. It's always busy but they're very efficient at moving the line along quickly. I suggest eating there rather than getting takeout because in my opinion, it tastes a lot better that way. The best times to go if you want to get a table are just before 12pm or closer to 1pm. I always order the pad thai with the chilli lemongrass shrimp and would recommend trying their pad thai when you visit. The prices are great compared to other Thai food places in the area and you get a lot of bang for your buck. I can never finish my order before getting full. If you haven't already, this is definitely an awesome lunch place to check out!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for quick, affordable, and filling Thai and Vietnamese lunch, dinner, or late-night options! I've had regular brisket pho as well as a shrimp stir-fry with pad thai noodles and bean sprouts, and other dishes as well, such as a chili chicken stir-fried rice, and a shrimp stir-fry.
It's quite easy to find healthy options here, with minimal fat. Noodles tend to be a bit healthier than stir-fried rice, which can be greasy.
There are so many menu items that it's hard to remember what one has had, but it's usually very good, served quick, and if you get a seat by the window later at night, lounge a bit and people-watch :)"}
{"text":"Not a super fancy place but food is good for the price! 

You order your food upfront (instead of having a server come up to you to order), however the servers will bring your food to you."}
{"text":"This place has amazing deAls and really good food . Great for casual atmosphere and quick affordable meals"}
{"text":"The food is quick, cheap and decent for when you are craving 'fast food' Vietnamese food. I've had their vermicelli with grilled pork, cold rolls and mango salad. All are great  for the price, efficiency and location."}
{"text":"What Speedy service!
Love the atmosphere.  Ordered the Tofu and Spring roll on vermicelli.  When I confirmed that it was vegetarian, I really appreciated how the server asked if I was vegan."}
{"text":"There are several Ginger locations, and this one was convenient for me.

Some other locations I went to weren't very clean. This one is a bit better, and is also a bit more spacious.

Everything is self-service here. There's a station where you can grab a cup, get some water, and then add a lemon slice. There's another station full of utensils.

They have a large menu with different types of food depending on what you feel like getting. Maybe you want some pho, or a rice dish, or perhaps you just want a sandwich. When your order is placed, they'll give you a number and you can just grab a seat. They also take do Ritual.

Prices are a little under $10, so not that cheap, but compared to other restaurants in the area it's definitely more affordable.

I find the portions aren't too big compared to other vietnamese places I've tried.
The customer next to us had ordered a regular bowl of pho for $6.50 and it was just the tiniest bowl of pho I've seen so far. Their large isn't that much bigger either.

I ordered a grilled chicken rice dish. It came with cabbage, as advertised on the menu. Kind of wished I had the option of getting bok choy instead, but I'd have to pick a different dish.

Food tasted alright. Rice was a bit hard but I'm not sure if that's just how vietnamese rice is done.

It's an alright place if you're looking for vietnamese cuisine under $10 when you're in the area. Though for an extra 5-10 mins of walking you could head to chinatown and access more vietnamese restaurants.

There's an advertisement up front for a 16-inch bowl of pho, which they call the \"world's largest\" bowl. Something unique at least."}
{"text":"I have been visiting the Ginger chain of restaurants for at least 8 years. 

I'll be honest, about the only thing I get from here, whether it is to eat there or to go, is their Pho. 

Almost everything else, including the decour looks as bland and as generic as what you would get in \"that food-court that you hate to go to in that strip mall out of town where they sell that very cheap xyz item you like and go out of your way to get twice a year.\"

Everything in the menu seems very pedestrian and you get the feeling most people here are for just three reasons: 

A-) they are either like me, someone who likes one dish -my friend loves their sandwiches, but hey, to each is own. 

B-) There are those who come here because it is convenient... In fact the only reason I used to to Ginger was because their pho is alright (-A), AND I used to live 45 seconds from a Ginger back in my Uni days. 

C-) Third-World-country-like-budget.  (AKA: Student)

So, if you are on a budget, you will like this place because primarily is kind on your wallet. As you will get your fill and a more varied diet than if you ate just pizza and hot dogs. But if you are willing to spend a bit more than say $10 and maybe want to, you know, care about *where* you are eating then I am sure you could find a nicer place. 

FYI: even Not Just Noodles is better since it is also cheap but they have a much larger menu. You know, just sayin'"}
{"text":"This place can be found on the busy strip of Queen St. W. After doing some research online, I guess this is a chain of fast food Vietnamese restaurants.
The place is very clean and the food is great. You go up to the counter, order one of the many meals and you get a number. You can either do take out or sit in. the service is so fast.
Last night I had a Vietnamese Vegitarian Sub which is like ban mi but it has fried tofu on it and without the brown paste. (3.50)
Many small snacks available. Cheap beer and the food is all very cheaply prices. I can imagine this place being filled to the rim at lunch time. 
Anyways, check it out if you are ever in the area."}
{"text":"I love how fast they are at this place. They have numerous options you can choose from. The pho is outstanding and trust me, I've tried different phos all over the city nothing compares to this one (this particular location) I love love love it. 

However, there's a female cashier that's usually there that's a bit rude. Besides that I give this place 10/10. Totally recommend it"}
{"text":"I found this place on ritual because I had a craving for viet food, which can be hard to find in the downtown core. We ordered the grilled pork with spring roll and vermicelli and it was really tasty. We also got 2 fresh smoothies that had so many fruit options. I opted for a side of pad thai just to try it out, but that the only thing I wouldnt get again. Otherwise I will definitely be back for tasty cute with a good value!"}
{"text":"Ginger offers the usual kind of viet food that you can find in other viet places. The key difference with Ginger is that many of their customers are getting takeout. There isn't a lot of space to sit and one nice thing about this is that I don't have to pay tip. You pay at the counter and you can eat at a table if there is space. It's downtown locations are perfect for working office people who want to grab something and go back to their office. The food comes out pretty fast even during busy hours. If there's a bottleneck, it's not with the kitchen. It's because there are lots of people lining up. 

Usually I get pho in a viet restaurant but with Ginger, I tend to get their rice + \"stuff\" dishes. Rice dishes are much more portable than pho. The prices are good too. One rice dish will cost you between $7-9 after tax. It's pretty good value because the portion is generous. 

My only real complaint is that their food is more salty than I'd like. But do note that I like my food light. I think the average Canadian will find the flavor just \"normal\". There's also a bit more oil than I'd like. I guess that's why it's so delicious. 

I recommend anyone working in the area to give this a shot. I think with viet food, there's very little variation in quality. Pho and rice dishes are fairly standard and simple. So the main consideration rests on price. This place delivers decent food at good prices."}
{"text":"Often stay at the Hilton around the corner and this place is great if I want a cheap meal in the evening. Recently had the beef pho and a beef sub. Was out of there quite full for $10.00. 
Lady at the cash is quite friendly in the evening when it is not crowded. Wish they were open a bit later than 10:00."}
{"text":"They don't carry brown rice.  Disappointed.  I ordered 55 and 45 but they do not carry brown rice unlike other locations."}
{"text":"Ahhh I love Ginger, I'm so shocked it has only 3.5 stars. 

My boyfriend, who is Viet, also loves ginger! 

Ok shock over - we love Ginger because for having Chinatown prices, the meat they use and the portions are better than in Chinatown and the flavours are authentic. 

My only woe with Ginger is that they don't put cilantro, basil, or mint in their salad rolls. 

Pad thai is delish, pho broth is awesome, and their beef banh mi (Viet subs) are insaaanely tasty!"}
{"text":"Very cheap, very fast and big portions. As most places though, you do get A LOT of rice and not as much meat. Restaurant isn't the nicest but there's huge windows so you can sit and people watch while trying to finish a meal you barely paid for."}
{"text":"Possibly the most bland pho I've tried to date, however the mango smoothie was good."}
{"text":"The food is always consistent and good but the service is falling off here.  It took them 15 minutes to bring out my bowl of Pho, then they forgot to bring out my chicken rolls and the waiter spilled my smoothie on me and didn't say a word."}
{"text":"One of my all-time favourites since I set foot in Toronto 3 years ago, this place is super cheap, super fast, and very tasty. It's basically fast food but Vietnamese. My favourite dishes include beef vermicelli and lemongrass beef on rice. The pho is nowhere near authentic but passable when I'm craving for some."}
{"text":"This quick takeout place is reasonably priced if you are looking for some Asian food or a bowl of pho. You can even eat there where there are a few tables and self-serve yourself with a glass of water with lemon.
The place rolls out your food in no time whether you eat there or buy takeout. The food is delivered to your table with no tip required."}
{"text":"A popular Vietnamese restaurant with multiple locations. Quite the popular place during different times of the day especially during lunch and dinner. There is a decent amount of seating here but usually gets pretty packed during the peak lunch and dinner times. They accept card payments here but if you pay with cash, you get 10% off your meal- not a bad perk to pay with cash. I've ordered the pho in the past and it was pretty decent but the portion was small. This time around, I ordered #58 which is the Pork Chop and Chicken on Steamed Rice for $10.25. I also ordered a hot Vietnamese coffee. The meal itself was pretty good. Chicken and pork was nicely seasoned and cooked. The fish sauce makes everything on the dish taste good so definitely ask for more!! The coffee brewed nicely and definitely a staple for me if you come and try Vietnamese cuisine. For the price and the quantity you get, it's not bad and cheap. It makes for a nice meal or if you are craving for some Viet food, definitely come by here!"}
{"text":"I only ordered a few spring rolls from there since I needed a quick on-the-go small meal for my trip home. Spring rolls were pretty good and were cheap for such large rolls (other Pho places would charge like $3 per spring roll). I can definitely see why this place is so popular - the food is decent, cheap, and it is prepared very quickly."}
{"text":"Great for a quick lunch, and a craving for average vietnamese food downtown.  I would order things that are hard to screw up, like vermicelli with meats, as opposed to noodle soups (go to a better place for that). 

Prices are decent, and service is fast.  Be prepared to share a table when it gets busy."}
{"text":"Arguably the best of all the Gingers.  I had the Viet Sub, very tasty and the spring roll was hot crispy and fllavourful"}
{"text":"I got the grilled beef vermicelli,the flavours were spot on, the spring roll that came with it was great! My bf got the rare beef pho, just the broth was flavourful,he really enjoyed it.also ordered fresh shrimp rolls.. they definitely were fresh, and it went really well together with the sauce it came with  :-)"}
{"text":"A quick, convenient and delicious place to grab a delightful Vietnamese or Thai meal. The coconut shrimp for $9.25 is my go-to meal here: succulent juicy shrimp with a subtle cocunut sauce and fragrant rice. Grab a smoothie while you're there for only $3.99. The pho and other soups are on par with other Vietnamese and pho places.
It isn't the most beautiful restaurant but the concept is more like a fast food restaurant where you order and pay first. However, don't let that fool you! Ginger has the price and atmosphere of a fast food restaurant with the food quality of a sit down Asian restaurant!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place as it was close to work. I dont normally write reviews, but this one was so bad i had to share.

I ordered through the Ritual App, so all I do is go in and pick it up. The nice part was that I didn't have to wait in line. 

When I walked in, I saw a line up close to the door - my first thoughts was that this must be a popular place with a line up so long. I was excited to have found a good Vietnamese restaurant close to work. 

I walked in, picked up my food and left. When I opened my bag, I was surprised by how little  food they gave me. I ordered a large, thinking that I will have leftovers for sure. But the noodles, beef and all the bean sprouts added to half a rectangular take out container. The soup was more than enough to cover the noodles. The noodles was probably a small hand full.  Looks more like an XS size noodle soup than anything!

Now the taste: Everything was diluted!!!! The soup was definitely diluted, you can taste hints of the seasoning, but oh so bad cuz it was so watered down. This is the WORSE Vietnamese noodle soup I have ever had! Even the sauce they gave me, the hoisin sauce and hot sauce mixture consistency was very thin. 

Go to Chinatown for good Vietnamese food in Toronto instead. This place may be cheap and fast, but the food is definitely not worth it!!!"}
{"text":"I'm with Denise S.  It's Cheap and Vietnamese, and the location is good.  I think the Pho at other places is better but the location is definitely preferred.   I don't think I totally dig the cafeteria style either."}
{"text":"More like a takeout place, no service, table sticky, the space is a little bit dark. Definitely had better pho before. Price ok but not cheap. Won't go again"}
{"text":"Awsome pho and spring rolls at an affordable price! Nice semi outdoor concept gives a nice ambience."}
{"text":"Pros:
Location
Fast service
Prices 
Seating

Cons:
Broth is watery
Beef tastes microwaved 
Beef is rubbery/fatty and definitely not lean
Service was reflective of its price.
Cleanliness of restaurant

Summary: 
I will never try this restaurant again. I love pho, but Ginger serves the equivalent of packaged ramen noodles (if not even worse). If you have to eat the pho here, get it without the broth, no meat and just noodles.... oh wait, I think I mean, DO NOT go here if you like authentic Vietnamese pho/broth."}
{"text":"This place has good well-done Pho, but don't try to order extra noodles on the side - the lady working the cash last Saturday had very limited understanding of English (or she just wanted to jack me for an extra order of plain noodles, which in that case, she understands English exceedingly well).  The Pho is tasty and everything but does not have enough noodle and my husband would say it didn't come with enough meat.  Enough said."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Quick , take out service place. 

Food : 
1. Pork and spring roll vermicelli: Delicious! Exceeded my expectations, being vietnamese i am a bit picky on Viet food. but this was great. 

2. Beef/ Chicken Spring roll rice: This on the other hand was not that great. The beef was so tough, and dry. Chicken was super super thinly slice. The entire dish together felt really strange. Ive never had a Spring roll with my rice dish before.. 

Overall: Probably be back if im looking for something quick."}
{"text":"Surprisingly YUMMY!


I was tempted to try this place, after walking by a million times, and salivating at the plates I saw sitting in front of people inside. 

Today was the day I finally got to give it a go ...

There was a girl sitting behind the cash, multi-tasking; screaming orders over her shoulder into the kitchen, texting in her blackberry, and even talking on a cordless phone. 
But she was quick. I just hoped she got my order/special requests right.
....
Prices, CHEAP.
Each 'meal' has a photo on the wall (it's one of those places ..).
This makes it even harder to decide what to pick. Nothing looks overly tempting, due to the poor quality of photos, everything had a yellow/orange tinge to it. Typical, right?

After a few minutes of looking the wall photos over and over, I decided on \"#43\".
Pad Thai & Curry Chicken - $5.00
Simple enough. 

NOTE: 
I should mention the serving sizes looked huge in the photos, so I chose something that appeared a bit smaller. Most meals had a few different proteins (ie. tofu AND shrimp AND Pork ... chicken AND Beef ... ). 

Service, SUPER-FAST.
It was 2pm when i walked in, and the line up was long. This place was packed! 
I got mine as take-out, but only sat down to wait for maybe 3 minutes, and my number was called, and it was all ready to go. Wow?
Yes, indeed!

I walked home, opened up my Styrofoam box, and was excited at what I saw! 
Half of the container was pad-thai (with NO peanuts on top, as I had requested). There were MASSIVE chunks (at least 2 chicken breasts worth) of curried chicken, that looked rather good. And the pad thai wasn't scary looking. About 1/3 of the meal was a FRESH carrot, sprout & cabbage salad, and they were generous with the cilantro -- the smell of fresh herbs flooded the air the moment I opened my meal. 

I was dying to dig in.
I had to pre-cut the huge pieces of chicken, but they were tender & moist, well marinated in curry. 

Everything was really good. 
Surprisingly GOOD for the 'fast food' type of atmosphere is was produced in.

This meal was fresh & cleaner than most food you can find on Queen St W.
Definitely on my list of amazing cheap eats, and I'll be returning, but next time I'll bring my boyfriend."}
{"text":"Surprisingly decent quality food for a good price. Really fast service at a convenient location. Will return."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Thursday.  This location is close by to my office.  This is a pretty popular place it fills up quickly.  When up to the cashier and ordered chicken black bean sauce & baby bok choi on steamed rice $8.75.  They have lots of numbered pictures on the wall.  They will give you a number & you go back to your seat.  They will bring the dish to your table.  The black bean sauce comes in separate bowl. The chicken was good but I like my bok choi a little more cooked.  If you want water it is self-serve and you can put a slice of lemon.  I have eaten here a few times before & will repeat."}
{"text":"Cheap, decent Vietnamese food. Good for lunch, but not a place to have a group dinner. Pho is not that great, rolls are decent, fast food pan Asian."}
{"text":"New hood, new Ginger.

I can't believe it has taken me this long to head to this Ginger location and get myself a vietnamese sub. I'll be honest, I was fairly nervous that they wouldn't be as good as the Yonge Street location and my love for Ginger would go down a notch. 

The Sandwich - Top notch, delicious and filling. For 3.50, I dare you to find a more delicious viet sandy anywhere else. 

The Location - This MAY be better than the Yonge Street location. It was definitely less hole in the wall and felt more spacious. 

Conclusion - Delicious, fast, cheap and not too dirty."}
{"text":"Very cheap and filling but kind of bland. Go for something spicier like the chili beef. Can't complain too much at these prices. 

Update: the pho is very good and the servings are massive!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you would think is open 24/7. It's not. For that, you need to go to the train pho place on Spadina.

I usually get the vermicelli bun ($7.25) with the grilled pork, chicken, beef, whatever I'm feeling that day. Sometimes get the Pho w/ rare beef which is decent. Spring roll is nice, although I'm not sure what's in it. The resto itself is probably a bit below average in terms of cleanliness. I worry how often the seats are cleaned (if at all). So don't linger too long, which I think is what they're aiming for anyways.

It's consistent, it's fast, it's average priced. It's where you go when you want to get something quick but not a food court, something that's actually cooked for you."}
{"text":"Love this place! My favourite dish is the beef vermicelli noodles! Lots of fresh fruit drink options including my favourite, sour sop."}
{"text":"I always like this place. I've been to pretty much every location in Toronto and it's 1. Tasty 2. Affordable 3. Fast 4. They also have the serve yourself freshly sliced lemons and water (a big plus in my books) as well as hot sauce etc. The staff are friendly and know their stuff. It's win/win in my books!"}
{"text":"For fast cheap eats, this is a great place. It's set up like a cafeteria not a sit down restaurant. Plenty of seating though but more of a serve yourself type deal. 
I had grilled chicken and spring roll vermicelli and the spicy chicken on rice. Spring rolls excellent, chicken cooked well and not dry. 
Grilled spicy chicken was a 2 stars bc it seemed like it was just cooked with saracha sauce. 
Speaking of sauce, it was watered down which is pretty ghetto. If you're looking for something fast and cheap it's a 3.5 star."}
{"text":"Ginger's Vietnamese fast food is surprisingly good.  I had a combo with beef and curry chicken.  The meats were tender.  The beef was nicely seasoned.  The platter came with a good sized pile of crisp vegetables.

They're fast, cheap and give good sized portions of fresh, tasty food."}
{"text":"What can I really say about Ginger that hasn't already been said? It's good, solid food served quickly and for a surprisingly affordable price.

I've been coming to Ginger for years and my go-to is vermicelli with spring roll & grilled beef. I figured I should finally write a review because the version I had the other night might have been the best yet.

The beef was surprisingly free of tough, fatty pieces, and the presentation was definitely a cut above (ie it didn't look sloppy or hastily-assembled). The flavors all worked really well together, although I could've used more fish sauce to drizzle on the dish (but then, I always feel that way)."}
{"text":"If you want quick Asian food this is a very cheap place to go to. That being said you get what you paid for. Their hoi sin sauce and sriracha are completely watered down."}
{"text":"Had some kind of pad Thai chicken thing for lunch which consisted of lukewarm stale noodles with mystery sauce and large chunks of flavourless chicken. 

Do yourself a favour and go to the Subway across the street."}
{"text":"Love this place. Delicious and inexpensive. Less than $10 for a delicious bowl of pho. Help yourself to sauces and condiments. Water with lemon also available as self serve, free."}
{"text":"Their Banh Mi ( Vietnamese sandwiches) are REALLY GOOD! Try it if you go to this restaurant, okay? I promise you will NOT regret!"}
{"text":"Actually got my food from uber eats. Just finished my meal and I'm very satisified. I ordered a large cooked beef vermicelli with one spring roll and a mango slush. I was afraid of the flavour and size after I saw some reviews here. I'm okay with the portion. The mango slush is a bit small for $4.25 but it satisfies the craving.  The beef with broth was hot and delicious. The taste was there I'm not too sure about the msg. The spring roll was a tad bit oily but it was sooo crunchy. 

Totally for all 3 things with delivery came to $20.50 ish. If I didn't get deliver it would've been $15.50? Not bad with a drink. I think the drink would be much larger in size if I ate at the restaurant thought."}
{"text":"Nothing like a dinner meal that costed only $6.

This place is perfect if you're not extremely hungry for lunch or dinner and just want something quick to fill you up. Their pho, although small and basic, does the trick for $5.25. Service is also extremely fast in here, so it really does feel like a fast food joint.

They also have free water if you order food, so that's definitely a bonus.

There's obviously a lot of other better places in terms of Vietnamese cuisine, but if you're looking for something of a lighter portion, cheap, and quick, this is definitely the place for you.

Free wifi!"}
{"text":"Best kinda food for when you get super hungry, I had the number 46 which was grilled shrimp, beef and chicken, I highly recommend the mango milkshake with tapioca pearls :)"}
{"text":"We came here literally right the second they unlocked their doors! And as soon as we saw that they had a giant bowl of pho here, we knew this is what we were going to order. You don't need to pre-order the giant pho (at least, we didn't and they were still able to accommodate us!). 

This gargantuan pho is like a pho dac biet sans the tripe - it's topped with rare beef, beef balls, brisket, and chicken. They are extremely generous with the meat - there was TONSSSSSSS! It's meat heaven for you meat lovers. Fyi, the lime is kept where the sriracha and hoisin sauces are so be sure to grab some to squeeze on your pho! Taste-wise, it's a pretty average pho... soup is decent, not super flavourful or anything. We had 5 people sharing this bowl and it was definitely more than enough! I would say it's good for 4 very hungry people or 6 meh-hungry people. 

We also ordered the spring rolls and fresh summer rolls. Spring rolls we got were just out the fryer. The summer rolls were just okay, I would've preferred more veg in mine personally.

Service here is great though! The owner came over to check in on us a couple of times and asked us how it tasted. 

The giant bowl of pho is worth a visit just for the picture tbh in my opinion as it is quite well-priced. It's under $40 for that huge bowl and works out to be around $10 per person anyways! 

Bring a friendx3 to come try this picture-worthy pho!"}
{"text":"Solid, cheap, Vietnamese food in a convenient location. I usually get the chicken noodle soup (pho). Perfect on a winter day and also what I was craving recently getting over a cold. $5.99 gets you a really big bowl (4.99 for small). The chicken is quality, white meat, not the \"crappy scrappies\" so often found in soup dishes. The service is really fast. You order, pay, and take a number. My meal came in under 5 minutes. They have a nice selection of tropical juices, smoothies, etc. too."}
{"text":"Great food for cheap prices! I am not a fan of their pho but their vermicelli and Vietnamese sandwiches are delicious. It's my go-to place for a quick bite either for lunch or dinner. Location is awesome too since it's near the subway or after a long day of shopping on Queen street. Service is extremely quick!"}
{"text":"I'm always surprised I don't go to this place more often as it's in my neighbourhood. I guess I am overwhelmed by their huge menu. It's really a good place to grab a quick affordable meal... It's fast food, but not deep fried! Today I was craving something like a banh mi, but without the bread... and low and behold, I found they had a spicy beef papaya salad. And I thought that'll do! The salad is really reasonable at 4.85 and it totally hit the spot. Crunchy green papaya, carrot, spicy beef, crushed peanuts... Mmmm. In the past I have opted for the spicy beef and lemongrass on rice as well. The spicy beef anything there I am sure is good. In the past I didn't love the spring rolls. The banh mis are cheap and filling, though I'd rather go to banh mi boys."}
{"text":"Love the Vermicelli Noodle Bowls, and they are under $10!! The service is so fast your head will spin. This is my second time here, while visiting Toronto. The Vietnamese iced coffee is delicious too."}
{"text":"Quite busy here for lunch!  Not a major queue bc of such quick service provided.  Food is gd for what it is...fast.  Convenient location. Prices not the cheapest I've seen. But also not over priced.  I recommend !  Hits up the niche market in the area"}
{"text":"The wall mural of a beach transports you into a Thai beach wonderland. The illuminated tropical fish picture is also magnificently beautiful.

 The pad thai is the worst pad thai I've ever had and yet I order it every time I go. It's so bad it's delicious.  The crispy chicken rolls are heavenly. Everything is hella cheap and prepared so quickly. 

One time I saw the cast from MTV Showtown in Ginger and I was like \"Lol ur show got cancelled\""}
{"text":"Holy anxiety attack batman. While ginger is not the source of all the chaos, it should be noted that they do little to manage it and this place feels like a zoo at lunch hour. I really wanted to sit down and eat but I kind of had to predict whether a table would be free by the time I got my food. If there's not its kinda like tough luck, you ordered it for here, figure it out. 

People who came after me were putting jackets and backpacks at tables, as I had neither, this seemed very unfair and I think there should be a sign or something saying not to. 

Anyway I gave this place a 2 but to anyone who does that backpack table reservation you get a 1 at life."}
{"text":"I ordered a Pad-Thai noodle with curry chicken. And it literally came out with noodles mixed with pad Thai sauce with curry chicken breast on them. And some raw beansprout on the side. Tastes horrible, do not recommend"}
{"text":"Always go for the buns.  Veggy (tofu) bun is the best.  Tofu is deep fried and not oily, with the special sauce that makes this bun stands out.  I also like the pork bun, but compare with veggy bun, veggy is better!!"}
{"text":"McDonald's ain't got shit on Ginger when it comes to speed.  And actually price wise it's hardly a premium to McDonald's yet you get a large healthy meal comprised of chicken, shrimp etc.  Also quite good tasting.  Not to be cheap but we also like how you order and sit down avoiding tips etc.  We get a special creation called the \"grilled chicken pho\" and add double chicken for 2 bucks.  Massive soup with tons of chicken.  \"Dope spot, cheap, quick and cheerful\" in the words of my hard to please fiance.  If only they were open later..."}
{"text":"One of my favourite fast food place.  Now that summer is finally here, I can walk over for lunch from my office.  Came here a few days ago and got my fav dish - grilled pork chop & lemon grass grilled spicy chicken with rice for less than $10 (don't remember the exact price).  The soup noodles and grilled meat subs are also great choices.  I'll definitely be coming regularly over the summer."}
{"text":"This place puts ot food quicker than any resturant or diner. The food is pretty good and fairly priced. I usually come at lunch and its usualy packed."}
{"text":"Horrible! I ordered through uber eats and they just cancel your order for no reason! I don't ever plan on ordering from this place ever again! Especially when you're expecting the food and they cancel it on the last minute!"}
{"text":"I  *heart* Pho!

My apologies to Canada, as I think I brought one of the worst colds I've had in my adult life into your country yesterday.  My voice is all but gone, I'm hacking up my lungs and I've got head congestion and a cough that would wake the dead.  

My friend wanted to go shoe shopping at nearby John Fluevog (she bought 3 frickin' pairs!  Jealous!).  We were hungry, and I demanded soup.  We spied Ginger and headed in.

I ordered the Hot & Sour Seafood Pho, she ordered the Beef Noodle Pho.  God, it was good.  And I feel so much better, now, that I have this miracle food in my tummy.  I also ordered an Avocado shake -- also great.

You're a godsend, Ginger."}
{"text":"The food is tasty, but the price is not as cheap as I had expected and the quantity is small. I ordered a grilled pork chop and chicken on steamed rice and it was really tasty, but the two pieces of meat was really thinned out and there was some cabbage on the side. For $9 the box was really light. Made me regret not going to HoSu down the street.

I enjoyed the food, but this is basic Vietnamese pork chop and chicken and going to any vietnamese restaurants in chinatown would have provided the same thing at better quality and quantity, service, and atmosphere for about the same or cheaper price."}
{"text":"Average pho. Had to add half a bottle of hoisin to generate any flavor. My beef was mostly gristle and there was no Vietnamese Mint which made me sad!
Two stars but only because no sooner had I sat down, my meal arrived. If it were slow, 1 star."}
{"text":"Decent, cheap, average food in the entertainment district.

I came in here on a Saturday during lunch hours and the place was surprisingly not packed. Mostly students, actually. 

You have to order at the counter, and then they bring you your food. The woman at the counter was arguing with one of the cooks and seemed annoyed with me, as she asked me \"what you want\" at least four times. I ordered the vegetable and tofu soup in vegetable broth. The food was prepared almost frighteningly fast, but being as hungry as I was, this didn't bother me very much.

I was surprised to see a heaping pile of actual vegetables atop the bowl of steaming hot noodles and broth! Broccoli, onions, red peppers, green beans, and bean sprouts, to be exact. The rice noodles were tender and delicious, and the cook on the vegetables was quite well done, too (not too soft and mushy). The tofu were chunky and most likely deep fried pieces, but soaked up the broth quite heartily.

Although I enjoyed the size and portion of the bowl, I feel that the broth may have been just a bit too salty. I don't want to confirm this because I am quite accustomed to eating mostly low salt/salt free, but it did seem very sodium and MSG laden. I also didn't taste any significant seasoning in the broth besides salt, so it's quite possible that I was eating salty hot water with noodles. Hmm.

I don't think I would recommend this place to many people. There are so many better places in the area for Asian food (although I'm not sure specifically about Vietnamese food) and they have surprisingly few options for pho which was disappointing. Will probably not return and opt for miso and tofu soup nearby at one of the many Japanese establishments near by. You live and you learn."}
{"text":"I call this place the Chicken Roti place. 
You GOTTA try  Chicken Roti 

Idealy when you hear the word roti, you would imagine some sort cury meat with potato wrapped in a light yellow indian bread. But Viet Roti is nothing like that, it's nothing to do with cury or bread. Its more like Viet BBQ Chieken with rice. Its more like Jamacan jerk chicken. It's sweet savory spicy peppery, you can feel your taste buds getting excited at instant the food reaches in your tongue. You would get huge piece of boneless meat off chicken thigh, with skin. Skin is crisby and under the skin is the tender juicy meat. 

This place closes early though, you should try to get there before 10:30, I went there twice in a row at night that they were stop letting ppl in before they close. So get there early. I had to finally give in and order take out early so I can eat later. Their Chicken Roti dish taste 100% fresh after in fridge for 2 days. I often order extra MIXed vege (make sure call MIXed vege, not just extra vege. I got only cabbage once lol)

It's def one of the hidden gem in downtown. U gonna try Roti if u love BBQ Chicken!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the curry chicken pad thai. The pad thai was made with a ketchup sauce! I guess you get what you pay for. This will be my one and only visit to this place."}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful. Quick service with decent quality at a low price. Does the trick in a pinch."}
{"text":"I walked in for take-out the other night and my conversation at the till went like this:

Vivek: \"Hi, I'd like a combo number forty-five and--\"
Cash: \"That'll be $9.00\"

Just to be clear, there was almost no space (a femtosecond really) between the \"and\" and his brusque ringing up of my order. I didn't pause for an hour or whisper the word \"and\" or fall asleep on the floor. All I wanted was a smoothie with my meal and what I got was \"let's-keep-this-going-NEXT!\" from the server. It wasn't even busy. Why the verbal cock-slap?

And to add injury to insult: my pad thai wasn't very good. Over-cooked chicken, limp noodles, a kind of mouth-hating flavour. And don't even think of telling me that I \"ordered the wrong thing,\" yelpers. If it's on the menu, it should be passable. This was barely.

Obligatory Title Pun: Tread GINGER-ly.

Menu Readability: Pictures and numbers! Pretty useful actually.

Need to mention: The food comes out quickly. (Too quickly?)

What this place teaches me about myself: Deny me a smoothie, and the talons come out."}
{"text":"Service is frighteningly fast - while they're taking your order, they're simultaneously processing someone else's. The food, however is mediocre. I thought that my vermicelli was fine - but my two friends who ordered the beef pho were sorely disappointed. The meat was not even close to rare, and the broth's seasoning left a lot to be desired.

This place does win, though, on price. If you need a quick bite and don't want to drop a lot of dough, this place could do in a pinch. There's far better options, though, elsewhere on Queen."}
