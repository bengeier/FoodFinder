{"text":"Just went in with my family, and the lady at the desk was cold and unfriendly: she told us we had two minutes to order before the lunch special was order: no thank you, we got up and left."}
{"text":"Thank you for opening up a HK style cafe in Vegas, finally!  The lemon tea tasted pretty much like it does back home. I have yet to try the milk tea though; can't wait until I go back to try that.  I had the satay beef noodles.  The satay sauce was spot on. The beef was great, but I would have preferred slightly thinner slices.  Can I suggest more snack items, and that in the sandwich section, add the ham and egg sandwich too?  And HK style french toast?  Please and thank you!  Five stars for quality of food and four stars for variety."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. I found this gem from Yelp. The reviews were accurate. This is the best Chinese place in Gastonia. It is a carry out spot. The sanitary score was a 100, you could tell by the condiments and the bagging of our food that is what a clean place. The prices are great. We opted for the family meal which was $15 for enough to feed 3-4 people. I feed one adult and two children. The next size meal with $8 more and that would easily feed four adults. Sesame chicken was just the way I liked it. Chopped in small enough pieces to eat and the sauce tastes great. The egg rolls were the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Delicious milk tea and shrimp toast. Very kind and attentive to allergy issues. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great American Chinese food. Price was fair for large portions. Nice clean kitchen as well."}
{"text":"Hands down this is the best place for Chinese food around!  It's in a strip mall, right next to the Food Lion so you'd probably think it's just average but it's not.  Combo plates are around $6-7 and come with a main course, vegetable, rice, egg roll, and a drink.  So the value is pretty awesome, I've never been able to finish a meal I was so stuffed. The staff is always friendly and the service is very quick.  My family and I usually eat in, the server will bring your food out to your table and the longest we've waited has been about 10mins max and that's for 3 full orders. So check this place out, would hate to see it fall because it really is the best around here."}
{"text":"My husband eat in & carry-out from often. The best food for the buck. I suggest you give it a try."}
{"text":"First off- this place is CLEAN! Always has a sanitation grade of 99-100. Restaurant is immaculate, organized, and food is fresh. Chicken is good quality and always white pieces, never dark mystery pieces. I like a spicier lo mein than they serve, but that's just my personal preference. We have tried a LOT of their meals and everything has been great. We can feed our family of 4 for under $20. They are also fast- usually have our order ready in under 10-15 minutes. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Finally, an authentic Hong Kong cafe that serves the real Hong Kong Style Lemon Ice Tea in town. Althought they have just started, you can tell there is a strong passion from the owner. Quality tapas and drinks, I would definitely recommend everyone to give that a try."}
{"text":"I had a taste for Chinese food so I read the reviews and decided to call for a to go order.  Haven't gotten my food yet but call in service is poor.  Person that answered the phone just said \"hello.\"  I had to ask if this was the Lucky Café?  When I gave my order he asked \"sides?\"  Since I couldn't read the menu online because it was so small I asked what sides they had.  He sounded upset that he had to tell me the sides.  After I gave my order, he said it would be ready to pick up in 10 minutes and hung up.  I realized he hadn't asked my name or gotten my phone number.  I'm on my way to pick up my food now.  I'll let you know if food is as poor as phone ordering service."}
{"text":"it is located in the same plaza as Tea Station. Authentic Hong Kong style noodle cafe. We try the beef brisket noodle soup. It was amazing for $8.99. They have the best brisket noodle soup in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was really craving Chinese food and found this place on yelp. It's not much of a dine in place since we were the only ones eating there on a Friday night. I had the Mongolian beef with fried rice and hubby had the dragon and Phoenix.  The Mongolian beef was good, not spicy though. Would have like it actually spicy! Dragon and Phoenix which is general Tso's chicken and Szechuan shrimp. I thought the chicken was extra sweet but the shrimp was good. The helpings are huge especially for how much you pay! Definitely coming again!!"}
{"text":"Opem till 3am for late hk style noodles.  Descent size and flavor.  Items were not all available at the time of my visit."}
{"text":"Simple inside but the food is anything but! Super fresh, super tasty. Very generous portions! What a hidden gem in sourthern Gastonia. We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Best Chinese in Gastonia. I make the trip from Bessemer City because it's so great! My personal favorites are the House Lo Mein and Sesame Chicken. Also, their steamed dumplings are made with thin dough which I prefer to thick dough. Not too spicy either. Late hours are a plus, definitely give them your patronage- I know they've got mine!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to this place because of the relatively good reviews, was hoping this would be a good alternative to Tung Ky since that place can get very crowded. Went here for lunch for the first time today and I don't think I will be returning. The place is very nice and clean, plenty of tables, good for large parties. Their menu is quite small but good variety, noodles, fried rice, snacks, and a few drink options.   Service was not good, the waitress clearly did not speak English very well but she didn't even try, no greetings, not even a smile. Personally, if you are a new restaurant you should try a little more with customer service.   We ordered HK lemon tea which was ok, not as sweet as I would like but I'm not sure if it tastes like the ones from HK or not since I have never had lemon tea in Hk. We tried the shrimp toast which was gross. The slice of bread was deep fried and way too oily, small amount of shrimp on top, not much flavor at all, and the presentation was terrible.   My sister got the beef brisket noodle soup (which a few reviews said it was really good and it was their signature dish), this was very bad. Noodle was not crispy, did not taste fresh, the brisket had lots of fat (I don't mind fat but there was A LOT), the broth was so bland. The broth was shiny, a clear sign of lots of fat in the broth, didn't have any beef flavor or any seasoning. We got there around 11:30 so I'm not sure if they just made the broth so it was not flavorful or what, but the overall dish was not good. We added salt and chili to it but still was not good, my sister ended up ordering the Yang Zhou fried rice because she just did not enjoy the noodle, the fried rice was not bad.   I got the pan fried noodle with chicken. The gravy was way too thick, also kind of bland. The dish literally only came with chicken and Chinese broccoli, NOTHING else. Not impressed at all, I love pan fried noodles and this has got to be the worse I have had. Pretty much every other places give you a variety of vegetables, this was very bland and way too simple.   I don't think I will be coming back here, the menu is small, which is fine if the food was superb but I was very disappointed. I would rather go to Big Wong or wait in line for Tung Ky for better food at almost the same price."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The food is excellent, great service.  Always fresh and fast, prices are great too.  The restaurant and cooking area is immaculately clean.  Sanitation grade off 99 or higher consistently."}
{"text":"A fantastic little takeout place! Great location- I can pick up a  few groceries, my prescriptions, and dinner all in one plaza. They're always so fast. I've never heard them say it would take any longer than 15 minutes for my takeout orders. Kind and efficient attendants: it is an introvert's paradise. Minimal chit-chat and conversation, but polite and quick. The portions are definitely enough for leftovers for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Craving for some Chinese food...ordered the noodle soup beef brisket, fried rice BBQ pork, pan fried noodles beef, And fried wide rice noodles with stir frying beef... I must say....all dishes are superb!"}
{"text":"A for effort. Nice family owned new restaurant. Better than the place that got shut down for being unsanitary (next door). Open late so I'll most definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was the best Chinese food I've had in a long time! Everything was fresh and hot! So glad I found this jewel so close to my home!"}
{"text":"Great food dumpling  crab Rangoon  very fresh and it's not over cooked will be back for more"}
{"text":"Best Authentic Chinese Food in Town. Selection is moderate and always delicious. As a repeat customer who has tried most of the food. My best top 3 recommendation would lye between the cutlet and rice selection, the \"Best Wonton Soup in Town\" combo(it sounds gimmicky, but the chefs taste in cooking will make you eat your own words along with the meal), and the egg noodle soups.   The food has a great mixture between all ingredients. Your not just tasting just the meat or the veggies alone, but all of the savory spices between.  If I am hungry and I'm looking to get full and satisfied Lucky Cafe would be my first choice and suggestion of you are looking for great food in China Town(Spring Mountain Road) in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"There is nothing original about the food that is worth going for, and you can receive better customer service elsewhere. The woman running the desk was as friendly as a snake. Don't get in this business of pleasing customers when you are nasty and sour. Plenty of other options in the area. Never returning and regret giving my money to them."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Chinese in gastonia. The food is always great and tastes the same each time."}
{"text":"Best foods in town hands down.  We have tried other places but always come back to Lucky.  Their food is really that much better."}
{"text":"The food was fresh! I ordered beef and broccoli with plain fried rice. It was hot and seemed like they cooked it to order. I also ordered one chicken wing. They actually give you a whole chicken wing like they do in NY. It was also fresh and delicious. I was surprised that the food was so good."}
{"text":"Great beef chow fun and wonton soup. Owners are super friendly. The cook came out and explained that they do not use MSG so it was good for my son. Cooked with whole chicken. You can tell."}
{"text":"Great Chinese takeout. Low prices, large portions, fast and excellent quality! Everything is good.  Whatever you order, be sure to get some Crab Rangoon."}
{"text":"I have eaten take-out from Lucky Cafe many times. The food was good and ready when I got there. No complaints here."}
{"text":"The food was tasty and somewhat authentic. Unfortunately, we were all a bit too hungry to pause and take many photos. So why the poor rating?  We had the tendon and brisket noodle soup and the roast duck noodle soup with the curry chicken rice. They talked us into getting half of a roast duck but prior to serving, they asked us if $18 was ok for half a duck and we said what!? We can buy an entire roast duck elsewhere for the same price. They told us their full duck price is $36.   They said they make their own daily and we did receive some with the noodle soup that tasted pretty good. I much rather pay half price at Asian BBQ.   Tendon and brisket noodle soup - the brisket was very tender. These came with the thin egg noodles that you see in wonton noodle soup. They were overcooked and soggy. Broth was okay, but nothing incredible. There also wasn't very much meat ratio and for their price, I expect a hearty portion.   Chicken curry and rice - This was a bit of a gimmick. This was made with chicken wings which isn't usual. It should be called chicken wing curry and rice. The flavor profile was very good but I felt deceived with chicken wings. If it didn't taste good, I would have complained.   Roast duck noodle soup - this came with the thicker white noodles and the broth looked the same as the brisket soup but tasted a bit different. They could be the same base, I couldn't tell. Again the issue was the lack of meat. There were a measly 4 pieces of duck to the entire bowl.   The service was a bit subpar as well. They seemed unprofessional and had their little kid behind the register. He actually ended up serving us our waters. The older son was our waiter and was also unprofessional. Every time we asked a question he couldn't answer, he would run into the kitchen asking for his mom.   Overall, decent tasting food with subpar service. I likely won't be back with the other solid options in town."}
{"text":"Food - 4  Service - 5 Value - 5  I came here after working a 12.5 hour shift based on the Yelp reviews and came away overall happy.  I ordered the fried dumplings and the lunch portion of chicken lo mein.  I liked the dumplings, but felt the photo they have displayed was misleading -- the photo seems to suggest thicker skinned larger dumplings.  The chicken lo mein was also quite tasty, but I wish it would have had just a little more vegetable in it.  If I find myself in Gastonia again, I'd probably come back."}
{"text":"if you want a quick meal in a Hong Kong style cafe, this's the place, they've sandwich, noodles and rice plate, choice is kind of limited, may be they are still in the grand opening stage, one star for the free lemon tea drink, I got the beef brisket noodle soup, the soup base and the beef could have used more marinade, the pork chop over rice is okay with the sauce, menu need to expand to include macaroni, pasta, and baking food choices...if more items added to the menu and prices adjust accordingly, like offering lunch special as most of Vegas restaurant does, it sure will attract more locals plus other customers since not that many this kind of style cafe in Vegas."}
{"text":"The dishes we ordered Hunan Chk and Cashew Chk were delicious. The Crab Rangoon had waaaay too much sugar in them."}
{"text":"We stopped by to next door which is closed for a week for renovation. And stumbled upon this place and decided to eat here. It was a pleasant surprise.  It is not the big beef noodle anymore, but a Hong Kong style cafe. The new owners just recently moved from LA and started this new place. And the way they cook their dishes are fantastic. Authentic and taken a lot of care, the dishes are delicious and made at a good portion! We had the beef brisket noodle and fried rice and ham and cheese sandwich. The beef brisket was so tender. And chow fen with black bean sauce. Thinking about it now makes me hungry. Even with the sandwich, they ask you if you would like to cut the sides of the bread or not.  Ask the owner what is available before you order to get the most fresh dishes for the day!!!"}
{"text":"After visiting several Chinese food restaurants in town, lucky café seems to be Las Vegas best kept secret. Take it from someone who's Chinese to tell you that the food here is authentic. There are several in town that are just OK. But if you're looking for the best, you will find it here.   Friendly staff, clean environment. Affordable pricing. Great for the family."}
{"text":"Just moves to Gastonia and thought we'd give it a try. Ordered take out, Mongolian Beef, Sesame Chicken, hot and sour soup and egg drop soup. I was running a bit late to pick it up and as I was pulling in I got a call letting me know our order was ready. Wow! Everyone in the family liked everything! Another Wow! The beef was tender and chicken was yummy. No yucky chicken parts you have to put to the side thinking, yuck that doesn't look right. Both soups were awesome and their fried noodles rock!My only small complaint was the sesame chicken was a little bland but still yummy but I'll probably opt to try the General Tso's next time. Also thank you for keeping your restaurant clean! I'm one who checks out inspection reports before going and theirs were all great!! Will be back!"}
