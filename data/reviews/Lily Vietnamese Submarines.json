{"text":"Good value. Good food. Good service. This hole on the wall is consistently good. There is almost no seating so this is more of a take out place."}
{"text":"The rare beef and beef ball noodle soup is very good.  The broth is clear, non-greasy, yet has very good flavor throughout.  Pricing is $7.50 per bowl.  Their subs are on par with other vietnamese subs, ingredients very fresh.  They only have one table, it's more of a take-out place.  The husband / wife team who runs the place is pleasant to talk to and deal with and will make oders to suit.  Very good vietnamese food."}
{"text":"I always get the beef and chicken Satay sub with extra cilantro. By far the best Vietnamese sub I have ever had in any city. Owners always remember my order and are quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. Don't let the exterior of the place fool you, the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Just quick update....2 stars strictly based on their pho noodles..... Utterly disappointing. Definitely stick with their vermicelli and banh mi dishes when coming here! 4 stars as above for any other menu items and their quick friendly service."}
{"text":"We are regulars at Lily. Like really regular regulars. The proprietors are very sweet, always hustling to get their orders out, and they more often than not recognize my voice on the phone (which is adorable). We most often order vermicelli here, but have had their chicken satay pho (yum) and their sandwiches (also yum). A wonderful little neighborhood place that we're very happy to support!"}
{"text":"This is a takeout place, pure and simple--there's no seating, unless you count the token lunch counter up front (it's tiny!). I haven't tried their subs, only the satay chicken soup. Take note: by default it's a bit spicier than the versions served at Saigon Y2K, Bowness Vietnamese, or Essence of Saigon, and yet I poured in the side serving of chili sauce. Just the thing to warm you up on a -30 C day!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in their banh mis, of which I've had two.  Overly soft bread, lots of cheap carrot filler but not much meat (take a look at the picture, which isn't mine but which illustrates the point), and overall too dry / lacking in mayo."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a quick and tasty bite.  You can tell the owners take pride in what they make :)"}
{"text":"This place appears dirty but really is a hidden gem. The food is fantastic! If you can get over the fact that the place needs a fresh coat of paint, you won't be disappointed. Love their bubble tea too!! I love the beef/chicken satay sub!"}
