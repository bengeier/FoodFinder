{"text":"Great food. Fast, Convenient, and friendly staff. I go there all the time for lunch. This place beats any fast-food chain in the area.  Stop by and check them out."}
{"text":"Wow. This place was an extremely pleasant surprise. I've lived down the road from here for years and finally stopped in.  The food was really good. The soups were excellent and they had a tapas bar with hummus and spinach dip. On Tuesdays they have a taco bar and on Thursdays they have a slider bar. Friday, the day I was there, was a baked potato bar.  The food was fresh and there were mostly healthy options. My personal favorites were the Tomato Tortellini soup, spinach dip, and the BBQ beef at the potato bar. I didn't really dip into the salad bar.  I liked that they had several calorie-free drinks available.  The only reason why I give this place 4 stars is because they are only open from 9am-2pm, which is probably good for their location, but not good for me! Friendly staff. I will go back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday with some coworkers.  I had been several times in the past, but this was my first visit since they changed to the buffet lunch.  I was pleased, and I think this is definitely a better lunch experience than the previous format.  The lunch buffet has several soups (maybe 5-6), a full salad bar, a baked potato bar with regular and sweet potatoes and toppings (chili, shredded bbq chicken, cheese, broccoli, bacon, sour cream, onions, jalepenos, cinnamon butter, etc.), and a \"tapas station,\" which had a few different types of pizza roll-up type appetizers.  $8.99 includes a soft drink with refills.  I particularly appreciated the variety of zero calorie drink options (diet Dr. Pepper, peach green tea, and unsweetened tea) and healthy foods.  Everything was well maintained and fresh.  The most important part of lunch during the week is speed, which the buffet definitely affords."}
