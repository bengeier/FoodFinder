{"text":"Have become a regular,  French dip is really good and the smoke wings are exceptional. Love the mac and cheese balls. Glad the Sunday Buffet is back.  Most important, local owner who cares about the community."}
{"text":"They were out of most of the main courses we wanted but the fried mac n cheese was good. The brisket was brisket was great, well flavored and a good portion size. I'd go here again if it wasn't ~30+ miles from home"}
{"text":"Sign on restaurant states closed for vacation Aug.21-Sept.14.  It's Sept.22, they are still closed, and the sign is still up with no updated date. Not appreciative of the miscommunication since we drove several miles twice now to go there, only for it to be closed both times."}
{"text":"We were seriously impressed with this place!! The waitress was awesome, and her pink hair perfectly matched her cheery personality ;) 

The chili cheese fries were great, had home-made (read: real!) chili! Honestly, the best we've had in a long time. My husband and I both ordered Prime Rib, it was perfect, and that's not an easy thing for most restaurants to pull off!  Timing on everything was great, we didn't have to wait for things to come out, the manager came over to check on everything, drinks were consistently refilled promptly, a young man was playing the guitar in the corner, it was really a great experience!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ! We have tried the pulled pork, brisket, and smoked wings. Brisket sliders were really good. All of it was great with 3 sauce choices. Mustard based, vinegar based, and a classic sweet bbq sauce. Bar includes liquor and wide selection of beer."}
{"text":"Went for Thanksgiving lunch buffet 2015. The buffet was excellent. I liked the idea of servers serving the portions, very clean. I'm not going into detail about what was on the buffet, just that it was a full traditional Thanksgiving meal lay out with deserts. The service was fabulous, servers and wait staff very polite and friendly. Cleanliness of the establishment very clean and fresh. Price of the buffet, with the relaxing atmosphere, variety of food, service and hospitality of the management and staff it was a modest $15.89 each. Drinks and tip not included. We Thank you for a delicious and pleasant Thanksgiving day lunch. The Food Dude. :)"}
{"text":"I've been going past this building wishing it was back open. Low and behold it is and it is!  As soon as we were seated our waitress Allison is at the table to take our drink order before she clocked in. 

When asked for her opinion she told us what she liked, and she did not steer us wrong, even with the sides. The prime rib was outstanding, and my husband had the pulled pork which was just as good.  

I urge you to give this place a try, you will not be sorry!"}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say. The food is so good and so full of flavor. It's so good I'm speechless. The fried pickles are crispy. The brisket was so tender. The smoked wings were tender and juicy. We are getting the cookie for dessert and I'm sure it will be awesome. I can't wait to come back. Nicole was our server and she was awesome."}
{"text":"Best food in Kannapolis!! The smoked wings are amazing and the service was awesome!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Got here for the first time since it reopened. Waitress was Allison P and she is super friendly and attentive. Red Oak Draft beer cold and delicious. We ordered six smoked wings as an app with Texas Sweet Sauce on the side. Prime Rib with fried okra and green beans on the side along with pulled pork coupled with twice baked potato and sweet tater casserole.  Excellent menu selection. The smoked wings are as good as dinosaur bbq in Rochester NY. if you have ever had them you will know what I mean! All food was fantastic!! Super excited to see if they can maintain excellence. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Finally had dinner here after driving by for years. Very friendly and helpful staff!  The two kids loved all of their meal! The filet was cooked to perfection! Mac and cheese balls are delicious!
Salad bar was fresh and full with a nice selection!
French dip was off the charts! 
Thank you for a great experience!
Next time I'm getting the house smoked wings!
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I would call this average. Pulled pork was tasty, as was the sweet potato casserole. Fairly normal side dishes otherwise. Service was decent. The atmosphere... well, my companion was black, and he got some stares which I was not expecting in Kannapolis. I don't consider that the fault of the restaurant. I would call it a family style, casual place and not a must-visit."}
