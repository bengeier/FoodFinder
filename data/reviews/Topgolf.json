{"text":"Our server, Jewell, was awesome! Thank you for the great service and attitude. Would be great to have a hot tub and billiard tables if you could swing it. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I have to say the service is terrible. Hot, hot July day and no one around who we could get to give us water or order food. Given that we were prepared to have 6 entrees someone missed out on a good tip."}
{"text":"Love this place! We have always received great service but this last visit was made exceptional by our server Kat!! She was upbeat and ready to provide anything we needed. She made sure to consistently check on us and cater to anything we needed. She made food recommendations as well as drink ones that were on point. I recommend the asian wings and cheese fries.....and that chicken and waffles sandwich surprisingly good. We'll definitely be asking for her specifically the next time we go. Thanks Kat for making my visit with my husband and friends a fun one!!"}
{"text":"For someone who is not really a fan of golf i REALLY like this place. Its a great place to hangout, eat, drink and have a lot of fun. I only been there once and i can not wait to go back and do it all over again. it is also a great place for big groups. Thanks everyone at top golf for the amazing experience."}
{"text":"Great Place! Ton's of mini games to play! I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! We took our kids over the weekend.  One of our children has a life threating nut allergy. When we were ready to order we asked the waitress if they used peanut oil and she said she would check to see. Not only did she check , the chef came over to our table personally and told us what was safe for him to eat. AMAZING service what a great 1st impression! 
If you have kids and they are not really into golf as much as the parents request the 1st floor area so you can be near the game room. The kids could play inside and the adults can hang outside."}
{"text":"Facilities have been completely let go. Food quality is terrible. Staff is extraordinarily rude and unhelpful. My advice - go the extra twenty minutes to the Gilbert facility to be treated well and have a good experience."}
{"text":"Group of co-workers and I came here tonight, a Monday, we were all very excited to come here only to get extremely disappointed. We had a group of 5 and we were told a 45 minute to an hour wait, totally fine. The girl at the front desk Janelle, was nothing short of extremely rude and unprofessional. It had been a little over an hour and my buddy asked her how much longer it would be and she said there was a handful of guest ahead of us  still, that it shouldn't be over 30 minutes, an hour later, we were still there waiting with no sort of update. When we approached her one last time, she didn't seem to care at all that we had been waiting well over the advised time. So sad that the great atmosphere created gets COMPLETELY overshadowed by the poor service."}
{"text":"first time here this place is amazing and full of fun also our server dakota provided us outstanding service definitely will be back"}
{"text":"If you can handle a 1-2hr wait for a 'bay', then it's all worth it as long as you know what to expect.  We ended up waiting about 90 minutes on a Friday afternoon in the middle of spring training - had plenty of drinks and food at the bar.

Basically Top Golf is golf's version of bowling.  You get a couch, a waitress and a TV.  Then you can play a variety of games with your friends ... there are computer chips in each ball so the system knows where your shot goes.  You can make it as serious or non-serious as you'd like.  The scoring itself is a bit gimmicky - if you make one shot, the next is worth double etc.  Sometimes the chips in the balls don't register your score even though the shots go in a net (happened at least 6 times in 2 hours for us)  - We had a bay on the 3rd floor, and from that high up, even if you shank a shot, it usually manages to roll in to some kind of net for points.  So, if you're a terrible golfer, go higher up!

All in all, we had a good time.  If you are in a casual group and have inexperienced golfers, then this place is great.  If you are a hard-core golfer, then it's probably better to just go out an play one of the dozens of courses in the area."}
{"text":"Great fun for an evening of dinner, drinks and golf with friends! Would be good family and client meetings or really anything depending on the time of day you went. We went on a Wednesday evening and it was packed and lively. We grabbed dinner so the hour wait to golf was perfect for us. Plan to grab food/drinks if you can because the evenings usually have a wait we were told. We didn't mind the couple glitches with our scoreboard but keep that in mind if you're playing for keeps!"}
{"text":"Normally enjoy coming here, but today on a Friday morning we are told we have to wait 30 minutes when there are at least 20 open bays, supposedly reserved..also TERRIBLE customer service today, wow, so disappointed in top golf. Also there is only 1 employee working the main bar/restaurant with about 10-15 people waiting in here and we have yet to get served, terrible fail on management today, I hope that this is just a one time occurrence."}
{"text":"I don't have much positive to say about this establishment. We were SO EXCITED to get a Top Golf. It is such a disappointment. They're unorganized, the wait times are ridiculous and the service SUCKS! I don't forsee them getting much repeat local business. Management needs to step their game up and reset some expectations with their staff. This is such a waste of a beautiful establishment. It could be so much better. We're not coming back and we're not referring anyone here."}
{"text":"Ok so I'd like to start out saying I've been to Top Golf a few times and have always had a good time hitting balls and hanging out with friends. The food is pretty good and I've always had good experiences with the host staff.....that was until my friend's 40th bday party on Dec 4th. There was a large group of us (4 bays worth plus some that did not hit any balls). My friend paid a pretty penny for this party with food and drinks included for everyone. The party was booked for 2 hours. 40 minutes before our time was up the staff started clearing away everything, including the drink tokens (again...prepaid) and food. We asked for to go boxes for the left over food and were told no, they don't give to go boxes (hello...already paid for food AND they do have to go boxes because I've taken my leftovers home from there before) due to \"health codes\". When asked to let us use the drink tokens, we were told that they called \"last call\". Along comes the \"manager\" gal who listens to the complaints and then promptly begins arguing with my friend stating that \"her staff is VERY well trained and asked everyone if they wanted to use the tokens (last call)\" This was a complete lie...not one person in our large party was told it was last call (again, 40 minutes before our time was up). I've never heard anyone argue with a customer the way she did. My friend was being very calm and asked her why they didn't come directly to her and inform her that there were tokens left so she could tell everyone. The manager just kept insisting that her staff asked everyone. Never offered a solution. So then along comes another manager, I believe his name was Shane, but I can't recall. Anyway, he was better at solving some of the problems and after learning we had planned to go to the bar there afterward (and spend more money I might add) he did offer to use the remaining tokens (I believe there were 9 in all...do the math on mixed drinks at say a minimum of $7) and did bring 2 buckets of beer to use at the bar. I can understand the \"party rules\", but I've never been to a place that starts cleaning up before the booked time is up and usually they ask the host if they would like the left over food wrapped up, after all it is paid for.

Would I go back...sure because it is a fun place, however I will NEVER book a party there and would not recommend it to anyone else. (I'd be surprised if anyone who attended this party would book one here). The main reason...the complete lack of customer service by the 1st \"manager\", she was horrible and was borderline belligerent. Might want to send her back to training, just saying."}
{"text":"Fun and a great way to spend an afternoon!  We had an excellent time and highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love the venue. Inside friendly staff helpful food is awesome!  Parking well that's a different story.  Only valet parking.   Went last night on a soft opening parking a nightmare lines to pull in lined up on Koval.  To get car waited 40 minutes  of course mgmt said outside company parking cars.  Over40 min to retrieve car.  Really need to work on this.  I will take a cab uber next time.  Will be back but not driving"}
{"text":"Great place for the family. Food and fun, what more can you ask for? Our group ordered the nachos, burgers, wings and drinks. Our server Sean was great!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go and hang out with your friends and family. Drinks are great, food is good, and a great time ! There are 3 tiers to drive from and as long as you remember that you want to score points instead of just killing a ball it's sure to be a blast!"}
{"text":"Exceptionally poor customer service experience. It was very difficult just to find someone to take a drink/food order. Also, due to poor, outdated systems, the manager was unable to credit my credit card and allow me to use my Top Golf gift card. Come on, this should be a simple process. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Me and a bunch of friends just went to Top Golf and had a blast. The prices are affordable and our server Brett gave awesome service. Definitely a place to bring your friends from out of town."}
{"text":"This place is sooooooo cool! I went with my friends last night and we had the best time ever! Lots of bays to golf, hi-tech, big screens to watch games. the bar is inside the pool, fresh beers, and great finger food. A really cool place. We had such a great time. Will come again."}
{"text":"Went back to TopGolf and had a great experience. The staff and management team must have made some adjustments since my last review and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's a great destination to have fun with the family, friends or colleges. The food is good, service solid and has a great variety of drinks. The only problem that keeps it from a five rating is the nickel and dimming. If you don't have your card (prior visitors), you pay $1 to replace it. I tried ordering just a hamburger patty with cheese, they couldn't do it. I was forced and charged for a full meal which included fries, bun and other dressings. All I was given was the patty. Oh well, the golf made up for the inconvenience."}
{"text":"Literally OBSESSED. Michelle is amazing... She made our night and seriously helped us with everything. And KEITH and KENNETH?!! These twins will make your life, so friendly and the best good luck charm!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time at Topgolf! We waited for about an hour and a half, but it was worth it! I had never been to a place like this, it seemed like bowling to me but golf style - very creative! 

Staff was awesome and so friendly. You are greeted as soon as you finish walking up the steps to the entrance. Our waitress was great, she was serving us as well as a huge party and did an excellent job attending to us both. 

The food was just okay... We got chips and guac, which the guac was just average to me and the salsa didn't really have much of a flavor. I did get the veggie burger and that was awesome! I ordered a side salad and was super sad to find that it came with cheese, eggs, and bacon. Most side salads don't come with those add-ins so I didn't think to ask! I just picked around them and it was no problem. 

Overall, I had a blast. It was so worth the wait and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Top Golf is extremely Inconsiderate. The fact they don't allow you to call ahead to reserve a bay or find out the wait time is blatant arrogance. Assuming your paying customers time is not valuable speaks volumes about management. They bank on the fact that most will wait 1-2 hours because they've already made the trip. They'd rather have people sitting around waiting (building hype like a club I suppose) than give the courtesy of a wait time. A/C units above the bay are just for show. The staff is friendly but incompetent. Everything we ordered took forever to arrive and several items were way off the mark. Actually hitting the balls and competing with friends was fun but overall I wouldn't recommend this place. I won't be back. If you'd like to sit around in the Vegas heat with high hopes and have your low expectations not met I suggest having a yard sell."}
{"text":"Took the kids for an afternoon of fun what a great time we had. Had done snack foods cheese fries and chip and guacamole plus some adult beverages. Flood not to expensive. Golf itself can get expensive so go early for the better rate. Kids overall liked the competition to see who could better. If you have kids better to be on the higher levels in my opinion. Can not wait to go back."}
{"text":"I love that Vegas has this venue. I wasn't that impressed with the food, but the jalapeño margarita is great depending on who you have make it. I have been 3 or 4 times now and the last margarita was the best one! 

Customer service has gotten better as well. Definitely worth going to, at least twice. Day/Night."}
{"text":"this is the most disrespectful top golf in Arizona. My cousins flew in from California and they wanted to go to top golf so we drove 45 minutes on 9.5  mile per gallon car and the place told us that even though we were all 16 and 15 we would still be able to golf, and then after we paid and waited 45 minutes for our bay they told us know and didn't give us our money back. Then when we asked for coupons or free games they told us to leave. head management was very mean. never coming again"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I live in Vegas, and was super excited to experience Top Golf...

Issue #1: they don't take reservations in advance. 

I've come to top golf twice now... The first time we came on a Saturday night and were told the wait would be two hours. OK. We decided to stay and wait at the bar. Drinks were TERRIBLE, way too sweet and poorly mixed for the price. After 2.5 hours I went to check on the time status. We were told it would still be at least an hour wait. We left... Not worth the wait.

The second time, we planned ahead, we checked in a top golf early (told 3 hour wait) then went and had dinner and drinks to kill time. Showed up at top golf after waiting 3.5 hours, and were told it would still be an hour wait!! I've spent HOURS trying to swing a club here and never actually got a bay. 

Save your money, not worth the hype!"}
{"text":"Fun game, kind of pricey but die hard probably love it.  However, the food and drink service was horrible. They forgot to put in our food order and the staff argued afterwards. They apologized and recognized their error, however I asked for a drink refill at 430, it's 505 and I never got it. You think after they screwed up on food, they would pay more attention. You can build a nice place and have beautiful amenities, however if you don't hire the right person they can mess it all up."}
{"text":"The first person to have interaction with Kelcie, should be fired ASAP! She is cold, not pleasant and unskilled at her task. Counter person Ashlee, great. Assistant to our bays Michelle, phenomenal! Manager (female, don't remember her name) great. For spending $250, all the great service was still over shadowed by our first person contact who needs to find a different purpose in life."}
{"text":"I'm really impressed by this awesome venue! I'm from Cali... I've never seen such a unique place to hangout, eat, drink and play golf ! The set up is amazing, feels like ur in a sky deck. I enjoyed being here, I would totally look forward to homing again on my next visit!"}
{"text":"I had never been to Top Golf before today. When I arrived they were on a decently long wait (about an hour) and Drew said there were spots available at their outside Terrace bar where I could enjoy the nice weather. Taryn and Ian were super helpful by recommending cocktails and making sure we were taken care of until we could be sat at a table. I would recommend this place to any of my friends friends based off of the bar service alone! I hope to come back soon and I hope to be served by Taryn and Ian again in the future."}
{"text":"This is an additional update to my previous reviews. Someone from corporate reached out to help resolve the issues with my initial review and I appreciate them for that.

She invited me back in and I brought my brother for his birthday and we had a great time. The service was excellent and the manager made sure to stop by our bay and check in on us. It was a great second experience. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Super fun place to drink and watch sports with friends. I highly recommend going here when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great thing about this place - NO golf skills required. Just a desire to have a fun time with great friends to relax, unwind, drink a few, eat, and enjoy.  Will definitely head back there again."}
{"text":"An entertaining way to spend a few hours.  It's a little pricey though.  The food is gourmet pub food, so definitely not healthy.  The deviled eggs were the best thing we tried.  Nachos are huge!  The games are fun and let golfers of all levels play together without too much frustration.  The automatic ball ejector is better than having to dump a bucket of balls.  We went in the rain and they did not close."}
{"text":"This was so much fun. The golf balls are censored so you can tell how far you hit. Fun games you can play with the different targets to shoot at. You can't bring your own driver, but you can bring your own irons if you wish. But they have every club that you would need in your bay. Went on a Saturday night and the music they played was on point! The drinks were good and the service was great. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"The concierge, bartending and wait staff were all wonderful. Special thanks to Austin who was exceptionally helpful and a pleasure to talk to. We can't wait for Topgolf to open back home in Vegas next year!"}
{"text":"Very fun. Food average to bad. Drinks and food reasonably priced. Great for smacking some balls around if you're only a casual golfer. I got the grilled chicken sandwich most recently, after te server responded to my query re:  what the best sandwich was. It was below average. Maybe terrible, in fact. When he came back he seemed to have forgotten that o had asked him what his favorite sandwich was and said he loved the brisket grilled cheese; it was his favorite. Just tell it to me straight, g. 

Stay away from the food. It's crappy bar fare. Just order cheap beers and have a few laughs over how bad you and your friends are at golf, and you'll have a great time."}
{"text":"Freaky golfing from the third story without falling off. Definitely try it at night with the lighted holes. Private parties are fun and the food is so good you would swear they didn't actually cook it there, but they do."}
{"text":"Great service especially for Platinum members. 

Fun place for all golfing levels. 

Food is fantastic, beer is cold. 

I like going with the family, friends or solo to work on my swing."}
{"text":"We went to Topgolf last night to celebrate a birthday. We had so much fun!!!  The service and the food were excellent, and the views are awesome.  Our amazing bartender William went out of his way to make our birthday celebration memorable. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Always a great time. Bummer when there is a long wait. Summertime is also super hot and I don't recommend the top deck. The Bloody Mary bar is always fun!"}
{"text":"I was told at door that you can only hit irons have to take woods and hybrids back to car.  Great job on designing a driving range that can't hold a shot over 200 yards.  Expensive place to begin with but way overpriced if you can only hit irons.  Been to one in Wooddale, IL.  Great concept just not in Scottsdale though."}
{"text":"Once you are in, its very fun. The line to check in can be very long. We decided to eat in the main restaurant the last two times we've gone. Unfortunately, both times we waited more than an hour for our food. Don't go there with hungry kids. Experience is average at best. A little service would increase the experience."}
{"text":"Terrible! 

First and foremost, folks, the bays have NO AIR CONDITIONING! That's right, no A/C in the middle of Vegas in the summer.

Second, check your bill very carefully! They offer a \"Veteran's Discount\" and claim when you reserve your bay that they have applied it to your bay. We had a Veteran in our group, so that made us happy. But then when our bill came, they had removed our Veteran's Discount. No explanation ever given. Just a bait and switch, I guess.

Third, we ordered food. When I asked several times where some of our food was, they kept assuring us it was on the way. 30 minutes later...\"oh, ma'am, we forgot to put in your food order, we just did it now...sorry.\" Which is fine. Things happen. People are human. Not the end of the world. You know what they did to make it up to us? Nothing. None of the food comped to make up for it being 50 minutes late. Not even a glass of beer comped as a sorry. Just food that showed up 50 minutes after we ordered it.

Great service, there, folks. 

Hot, sweaty, and untrustworthy servers. What more can I say?"}
{"text":"Great concept for an active party! Hit the ball while having fun with friends, eating really great food, and having some drinks. Staff super nice, food is fantastic and well priced, and time just flies by! Sat night here is a blast but be prepared for a 2 hour wait. It went fast for us because we hung out in the bar and had dinner and drinks. A must go at least once!!!"}
{"text":"I love coming here! This place is really fun for big groups! The only problem is you can't make reservations and on weekends the wait can be 2 hours! I think they should take reservations even if you need a credit card to hold it."}
{"text":"It is always a pleasure to come here. We came as a young men's group and had a blast. It is definitely a place to bring friends and have a good time. The prices are reasonable, though I recommend coming earlier. Always have a blast here and will be back again for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. A decent and varied menu. The managers, Michelle and Sean, were phenomenal. Both of them were very friendly, conversational and really cared that we were satisfied."}
{"text":"First time visiting TopGolf and probably the last! 

Granted we did go during a busy Friday evening but can we say TERRIBLE service in the bar!

It's first come first serve so we quickly sat down at a table when people left. Took 5 minutes before someone actually greeted us only to get her money that was left at the table and then leave. She came back 5 minutes later to ask us what we wanted to drink and when I asked if someone could wipe off the table she tells us that if we sit at a dirty table they assume that it's our mess... WTH?!? 

Gave two stars for the food which was good... But took forever! Had the nachos and chicken and waffles sliders. 

For as many servers there are tables don't understand why they are so slow and so unfriendly."}
{"text":"Super fun place to hit some golf balls and play different games, hang out with friends, eat some grub and have a drink."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing.  So much fun.  Drinks and food are also on point. Yes there is a wait to get a lane but there is so much to do there that the wait goings by quickly.  You will have a blast."}
{"text":"We have driven past this location a ton and the parking lot is always packed. We finally made it down to see what all the fuss was about the other night. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much - just a fancy driving range and I'm not much of a golfer. But it turned out to be lots of fun. We went with a group of friends and we were set up in one of the spaces with couches so we were able to chat and eat food comfortably while we took turns taking swings at the balls. All the balls have little trackers in them and monitors set up in your seating area that will show where exactly the ball ends up out on the driving range. I actually was able to improve a little while I was there. It was fun trying to aim for different colors and earn points. It was a busy night though and I wish they guy who brought our group back would've taken more time to explain the system a bit better.  We didn't realize we were in practice mode for a while and that you could choose different games to play. It is on the pricier side but when you go as a group and split it it's not bad at all. I'd go again for sure."}
{"text":"I have been there a few times.. always expecting it to be more fun than it really is. Basically a lighted driving range where you can only have one ball at a time. 

Overall not really impressed but will probably go back because that seems inevitable."}
{"text":"Cool environment (pools and music) but overpriced.  The food menu is decent.  Alcohol and beer are at premium prices."}
{"text":"Tried to go to Top Golf for the first time today. As we made our way up the steps this morning with a driver in hand we were stopped mid way by what looked like a Manager (I purposely say \"stopped\" vs \"greeted\" because her demeanor was nasty). She berated me & my daughter like naughty children - keep in mind I'm middle aged.  The associate was unapologetic when she proceeded to say, and I quote \"There's 2 things. Number 1... You cannot bring in your own clubs. Number 2... There's no drinks allowed.\" 
OK - the whole point of going out this morning was to try out my new driver & spend a father-daughter day with my kiddo. My daughter was carrying an unopened bottle of water, it's not like it was a soda or a bottle of Jack Daniels. Get over it lady.
So to your establishment I say: number 1 - the whole point of a driving range is to practice with the equipment you have to improve your game, so your rule is as ridiculous as telling a bowler they can't bring their own equipment into a bowling alley & number 2 - it's hot in AZ & it's appropriate to carry water with you when playing an outdoor sport. 
This place is a racket.
My guess is that they can't trust customers with golf clubs & are worried you're going to steal theirs. Guess what? If you can't figure out how to come up with a process that protects you while allowing people to enjoy the game as its intended to be, you don't deserve to be in business. And while you're at it, next time apologize, even if it's insincere I might not be as tempted to take time out of my day to write a detailed review about a horrible experience that you delivered before I could even get my foot through the door."}
{"text":"Our bay had technical difficulties once. The hospitality manager and a tech guy came to fix it. When they did it cleared all of our scores and started a new game. Once it was fixed we made it one ball in to the next game and the machine broke again. No balls would come out. By that time dinner was done and the fun was over. Lame."}
{"text":"Its right next to my house so I could literally walk there If I wanted too. The food is great and the golf mini games keep you entertained for hours. I recommend any flavor of the pressure cooked wings :)"}
{"text":"I  visited  earlier this month.  We were alone on the ground floor. No server came for 40 minutes. I had to call for a server. We planned to stay for an hour. By the time food and drinks came, time was up. Unfortunate incident. Have been there before but never had this issue."}
{"text":"We had a group of 7 and visited Top Golf on a Sunday.  We were staying at the MGM and a couple of us walked over around 11:00 am to get things set.  The rest of the group took the shuttle from the main entrance of the hotel around 11:30 am.  We got a \"bay\" on the 2nd deck without any wait.  We were told that it gets busy, particularly in the evenings and waits can run a couple of hours.  It may pay to call ahead.

I have nothing but good things to say.  The games are fun.  Technically, they can only accommodate 6 players, but a couple of folks in our party split turns.  Don't let the 6 player limit stop you from trying this.  The technology features balls with an inserted chip, so the ball knows who hit it, and where it landed.  You get points for accuracy, but given the layout of the targets, it is hard even for beginners to miss every target.  We had a total beginner in our group, and he still had fun.

They have several bars and pub food.  There are open lounge areas with big screen TVs. 
They even had TVs at the end of the driving range.  Everyone in our group thought that the food was good.  The servers are very attentive.  It is clear that customer service is a priority. 
This place would be an absolute blast for a night out with a group.  They even have a pool with cabanas if you are not the golfing type.

Like anything in Vegas, Top Golf comes at a price.  We paid $60 an hour for the \"bay\".  Prime time is a bit more, early morning a bit less.  Food is not included.  Our group of 7 was able to get through two games in two hours.  

Overall, Top Golf is a fun time for a group, no matter their golfing experience.  I'll go again the next time I'm in Vegas.  Top Golf rates five stars from me."}
{"text":"We LOVE TopGolf and will go any time we have the opportunity to.  We were soooo excited that we finally had the chance to stop by their flagship venue in Las Vegas.  

It was a little after noon when we arrived on a Saturday.  By then, they were packed!  There was an hour's wait for a bay so we decided to go get some lunch in the meantime.  We walked into the dining area on the first level and found a seat right by the bar area, where the bartenders enter and exit the bar.  At that time, the dining area was pretty open and they were not too busy.  We found a seat and waited for someone to come over to take our order.  And waited.... And waited...  

In the meantime, two larger parties arrived after us and were seated further across the room, against the wall and by the stage.  IMMEDIATELY, the wait staff gravitated over to them and started taking their drink orders.  I guess a big crowd equals big money.....  So while they started receiving their beverages and their orders were being taken, we were still waiting.  We finally went over to a manager at the bar who said they would send someone over, but it took about five minutes.  There were plenty of servers that walked by us or were standing around, that were not busy.  After a few minutes, the manager came over and took the order himself.  It took some time for the beverages to arrive, and then it took a while longer for our meals to arrive.  We also had to ask for settings.  By that time, we were there for well over a good half hour from the time we took our seats.

There was room on the table next to us, so another party of five arrived and sat down.  We warned them that service was slow.  Sure enough, they experienced the same problem.  They finally sent a member of their party over to the bar to have their beverage orders taken.  It took a while for their drinks to arrive.  They were looking over the menu and were ready to order.  The problem is that no one came by to take their order!  After about 15 minutes, they just got up and walked out.  Are we surprised?  Well, yes and no: for a flagship location to operate like that - yes; for guests to walk out after being totally ignored - no.  We have seen waaay busier mom and pop restaurants operate better than that!!!

Our bay finally became available, so we were trying to close out our bill.  That transaction took another 15 minutes to complete as we had to wave down yet another manager who asked someone else to come over.  They never came and the manager ended up closing it out himself.  We have never had such a disappointing dining experience at Top Golf!  We can't imagine how service is like when they ARE busy!!!

There was absolutely nothing about that service that made me even think that I was in their premier flagship venue.  As for the game play itself, it was fun.  Top Golf is a total experience.  I don't mind spending so much on a meal there if the service was even decent.  We have visited other Top Golf locations and have had fantastic service.

Would I go back to the LV TopGolf?  Probably not - not for that price point and the service failures.  We'll save our hard earned money and spend it at the smaller venues instead."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was a lie. When I got there I was told there would be a 25 minute wait. Then I was told there would be a 45 minute wait. I ended up waiting for an hour and a half. They then said the fries and wings where made in house. They tasted awful and they where so clearly bought frozen that anyone could taste it. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Last night we went to get dropped off at topgolf and was flagged down by a man in the parking lot. The gentleman worked there and had told our driver they are fully booked for the rest of the evening and turned us away. We ended up going to the casino then walking back over. It looked busy but we saw bays open so we went to go give it a shot. Sure enough we waited less than a half hour and got in. Might not want to turn away guests in the parking lot before they even try to get in!!!"}
{"text":"Topgolf is a great facility with great staff. Great concept - makes golf fun for any skill level.  Definitely worth going at night even though the price is higher. Also try and get the top deck if possible, the view is awesome!!  We will definitely go again soon."}
{"text":"2 hour wait for a bay we didn't mind so much, since we thought we could eat in the interim. From when we placed the order it took one hour for our food to arrive!!!! Our server was very nice, but the wait for the food was unacceptable!!! Brought my husband here for his birthday. Never again."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on customer service.  We did not get the opportunity to try the food or the activities.  We came in on Monday at 3:30pm.  The place was busy but we noticed several empty bays.  We were quoted a 60 min wait when we walked in.  Seemed odd but no big deal.  By the time we got to the \"concierge\" it was up to 90 min because they had some events going on.  We decided to wait.  While we waited we saw over 30 empty bays that never filled in.  After 105 min I went back to the \"concierge\" to see what was going on.  She then quoted me another 2 hours!?  I immediately asked for my money back and was referred to the manager.  He said they had corporate events and they had to keep the bays open because they were not sure when they would come in.  5 minutes after we left I received a text that our bay was ready, what the heck?  Very unorganized but like another reviewer stated, people are going to keep coming so what do they care."}
{"text":"Tried to go last night but left after sitting for half an hour without seeing a server. The people next to us were at the bar asking for someone when we left. So that's 2 full tables serverless for 30 minutes... on a Tuesday. Bad way to run a business from a place that wants $15 for a margarita."}
{"text":"I have visited Topgolf on two occasions, and it was a great experience both times.I was there with friends and we all brought our children. The atmosphere was amazing and great fun was had by all. The servers were extremely friendly, efficient, and professional. They explained (and helped us with) the process of getting everyone registered and ready to play. The food and drinks were exceptional. I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"If there's a zero star i would rate this place a zero! Super ripoff food and drinks (i mean $275 for fireball?! Corona for $9??) waited 2 hours and still didn't get to play golf because \"customers keep extending\". Why isn't there a limit for extensions??? And they still keep taking people in even when they don't know what time customers would finish playing. This place tricks you into waiting in line and then tells you you have to wait another hour...neverending waiting and neverending spending on mediocre food . Im outta this joint!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably a Funtime for groups or beginning golfers but if you have any amount of swing speed the clubs that are available are worthless.  You only get half a bag of cheap clubs and the only way to get good clubs is to join the monthly platinum club(100 dollars plus).  I asked to rent some but was denied.  So long story short if your any kind of golfer and think you can go to topgolf for practice you better have your own irons."}
{"text":"Went in this weekend with a group of 10 while on my buddy's bachelor party. Since we needed 2 bays together,  there was over an hour wait,but we did not mind. We ordered some food and had some drinks while we waited.  

The food took a long time to come out. They called our group at the same time our food finished. They sent our food down to our bay but made us pay the bill upstairs causing some of our meals to get cold.  

The golfing itself was a blast and thats why the 4 stars.  We all had a great time even if we are not very good golfers. Since we were in a big group the price was actually pretty cheap. Better time and cheaper than bowling.   Wish we had a top golf in the bay area!"}
{"text":"kAT was so engaging as our server. She kept us playing and talking! Great top golf experience. Thanks KAT!!"}
{"text":"I'm going with three stars because my group wasn't actually able to actually play top golf. We were going through to check in and were setting up an account and provided the clerk with a driver's license as well as a credit card for their file. After we handed him the card he then charged the card $50 and then told us it will be a five hour wait. It was 8 at night at that point. We would have just liked to have been informed of the long wait time before we were charged $50. We might be willing to give it another shot because it sounds fun, it just seems like they were trying to pull a fast one on us. Also, parking is pretty rough. I will review again if we do indeed actually participate in the full top golf experience."}
{"text":"Excellent sports ball. It's bar food, but super good bar food. Great drinks and fun atmosphere. I took my decrepit, aged mother here and even she had a great time!"}
{"text":"Really fun place! Have been many times now with friends and family. It is always a good time no matter who you come with. The food is really good (especially the Mushi and Donut Holes). Sometimes the wait time is a bit long, but that is expected on a busy Saturday night. They are very accommodating though with the two bar areas where you can eat and drink while you wait. The staff always looks like they are having a blast, even when they are crazy busy, looks like a really fun place to work. I would recommend it to anyone looking to have some fun."}
{"text":"Played 90 minutes of golf with 2 people and where able to play 4 rounds of golf at 20 balls each. Service was good. All in all we paid $54 and change for 90 minutes, 1 soft and 1 cappuccino.  Good value for money"}
{"text":"Can't give zero stars or I would have. 

Called around 2pm on Wednesday September 14. Asked if there were any big groups or events that night that would limit availability. Was told no. Asked if they had been busy earlier in the week. Was told no. Asked if a wait would be expected around 8pm. Was told no, only if it was Friday or Saturday. 

Showed up at 8 pm. Was told one hour wait for first level, two hour wait for second level, no access to third level because it was reserved for a big group plus there was a concert that was starting at 8pm. 

Not exactly the scenario that been painted for me on the phone, but we agreed to wait for first level after being told we could access food and drinks at bars/restaurants on first or second levels. Tried to access second level bar/restaurant located no more than 30 feet from the person who advised us to go there. Was told we could only enter that area with concert wrist bands. Was told to go to first level bar.

Tried first level bar. Was stopped by security and told that the half of level one with the bar/restaurant was reserved for a group. He said try the second level.

This may be the most poorly managed staff I have ever encountered. Not one person knew what was actually going on at their business that night. 

Unable to actually access any food or drink or a human being with a freaking clue, we left, $25 poorer thanks to Lyft rides to and from.

Advice: believe nothing that comes out of the mouth of anyone employed at this establishment. It is a wonder these people have the ability to remember the directions to drive home each night."}
{"text":"Love this place, I think it's my new addiction,  bloody marys with Mac, best waiter!!!"}
{"text":"Was visiting from Los Angeles with some friends. Had been drinking there for a cool 3 hrs with the boys. It was finally my turn to buy a pitcher of beer and they refused me because my ID was vertical instead of horizontal. I went downstairs and continued to drink the same beer that I had been drinking for the past hour.....all of a sudden approached by security and escorted out for not having a horizontal ID. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! Had been drinking there for the past 3 hous and all of a sudden its not okay and i get kicked out for my ID being vertical instead of horizontal. I am 23 years old for goodness sakes. What a load of shit. Wasn't the only one with the horizontal  ID but was the the only escorted out of the place. What a terrible experience. Thanks for nothing. Hope you guys figure your shit out sometime soon."}
{"text":"Only got 4 stars cuz it proved how horrible of s golfer I am. I will need to practice before coming back so I can rate them a 5 star. Place is amazing!! Nikki our waitress ROCKS!! Sorry about the Eagles losing today. By the time I finished my review I got some points on the screen so I changed to 5 Star"}
{"text":"I am a golf fan and play golf regularly back home in Australia. This place was so much fun took my friends who aren't golf players and they themselves had a really good time hitting some balls and having food and cocktails. Service was awesome real friendly, little bit pricey but definitely worth it if your a golf fan. Be aware they at nighttime your probably up for hour wait but there's plenty to do while you wait!"}
{"text":"Michelle was very helpful.  She makes top golf.  I would recommend everyone come visit and say hi to Michelle."}
{"text":"So much fun! I'm no golf enthusiast but the atmosphere, the music, the food and the drinks make this place such a dynamic place to come with friends and family. I've done a couple corporate outings here as well. Despite my lack of interest in becoming the next pro golfer, the driving range itself is a blast! Definitely recommend for any type of outing from date to team building exercise!"}
{"text":"A fun place to come. Staff is helpful and the food is okay. Pricing is different as per time of day. Overall a good place to come and have some fun hitting golf balls and scoring points with friends."}
{"text":"Had a great time service was fantastic and the employees were super helpful. There was one guy that seemed to go above and beyond but, I can't remember his name (one to many beers for me). Would recommend."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night just to hang out as there was a 2 hour wait to hit golf balls. My fiancé and I ordered burgers with no cheese and they messed up our order. We continued to talk with our friends waiting for our food and it didn't get to us for another 90 minutes. They did comp the food but that wait was ridiculous. Hire more staff!"}
{"text":"Lots of fun, good concept. Staff not very friendly or organized. Ridiculous waiting times. I have been there three times and have never gotten a bay in under at 2.5 hr wait."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the restaurant last minute, heard the food and drinks were good. Both of us ordered burgers/ tator tots. Beer and a specialty cocktail. Cinco de mayo dos for 3$. Cocktail was 8$. Small and weak cocktail. 
Burgers were delicious,tator tots could have been hotter. Good meal. 
What we noticed is all the employees doing nothing . counted 13 of them in the entrance talking, looking at there phones, yelling giving finger gestures to each other. No manager around. Prices would be lower with out all the kids on payroll.... We watched some of the drives, cool place but seems like a kid atmosphere with a bar."}
{"text":"Great place! We went with a group of 10 and played at 2 bays next to each other.  Prices were decent and service was excellent! Would definitely recommend this place for any occasion. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Service has improved. Pretty fun place to take family and friends visiting in town. Gets pricey though."}
{"text":"I love this place so much.  Makes me feel like a kid again. They offer from golf to food, to swimming, to beer pong , and a well organized gifted gift shop. Awesome eccentric staff, wonderful food, I don't know who can ask for more. See you there!  TGLV!!!"}
{"text":"***WARNING*** This place is not for Locals or \"Actually\" golfers.!. On Tuesday night I went with my date to check it out and hit some balls...of which, my girl hasn't hit a ball in about 8yrs...making her rusty. So trying to help and give her some tips will cost you about $50, because apparently the meter is running.!. So I found this out when we finally got into a bay, and figured out how to even start with a basic \"target game\"(on Rookie Mode), we realized that our server took it upon herself to start the game for us 30mins prior...wtf.?. 
Long story short, this place is ridiculously disappointing, a real tourists trap, and a scam.!. 
What golfer would be happy or ok with hitting approximately 30 balls, being treated like we're bothering the servers, because they just want to turn as many tables as possible, and being forced to pay for another hour because it ran out as our apps came to our table...and in order to stay in the bay; \"You must be playing!,\" as you eat apparently.?. 
Oh...and the kicker; for my girl and I, for two hrs, two apps, and five drinks, the bill came to $275.00.?. 
Every golfer knows; for that price what you can do, where you can play, and what you can get, when it comes to golf.!?. 
As a local & casino employee...I could never recommend this place, nor will I ever come back... If I was aloud to give it negative stars, it would be a -3... I feel disrespected, with a side of being kicked in the balls on the way out.."}
{"text":"Top Golf LOST my car key the night of 11/25/16! Thank goodness I always give the valet my valet key and NOT my actual car key because otherwise we wouldn't have been able to get home! 

I called Top Golf in the afternoon of Saturday 11/26/16 and they said they had my key and it would be with VIP check-in. Yet when I got there that evening, the VIP check-in people nor any of the managers had any idea who I was or what the lost key situation was. 

After waiting there for 30+ minutes, I STILL DON'T HAVE MY KEY AND TOP GOLF DOESN'T KNOW WHERE IT IS! VALET KEYS ARE EXPENSIVE TO REPLACE! *Hoping* they find my key in the next 48 hours, otherwise they will need to pay to replace that key, OR better yet, pay to have the whole key system to my car replaced since they don't know where that valet key is or who has it.

There were numerous chances that Top Golf *could* have shined with positive customer service, yet they are a day late and a buck short, and clearly they are SEVERELY lacking in proper communication among their team. 

They want to compensate me with free golf?! I HATE GOLF! I didn't even play golf on 11/25/16!! I was there to hangout with friends who were visiting from out of town and to be their DD! Yea, let me go back to the place with mediocre customer service, where they make you valet because there aren't enough parking spots, annnnd then they lose your car keys! Sounds great! #BOTTOMGOLF"}
{"text":"My review is not of the actual golfing (alleged two hour wait turned into a non-existent event), but of the service and food at the bar/restaurant. 

We sat at a two seater table. Never. Not once. Ever. Did waitstaff approach the table. Never. Did I say never? My companion went to order food at the bar - I asked for the grilled cheese off the kids menu because I did not want meat. They plop a brisket grilled cheese in front of me. I say something about how this has meat and the waiter says \"yeah it's awesome and walks away\" never to be seen again. 

Want a water? Have to go to the bar. Want a drink? Have to go to the bar. Want the food you ordered? Go somewhere else. 

Maybe next time I'll get to play and my review will change."}
{"text":"First off, I'll say that the concept of TopGolf itself is great. The games are very fun, the drinks were great, and we had a great time. The issue we had was with the wait times and being taken advantage of because of the long wait times. The pricing per hour is as follows: $25 before 12pm, $35 between 12pm-5pm, $45 between 5pm-close. My party showed up BEFORE 11am. Upon arrival, they made us pay for the first hour of golf. This was BEFORE 12pm so the price was $25. We proceeded to wait for over an hour. This put us in the bay at 12:15pm. When we arrived at the bay, the worker informed us that we would have to pay an additional $10 to play because we weren't at our bay before 12pm. I just feel like it's an extremely skeezy business practice to force your patrons to pay in advance for the time they've chosen to play, but then force them to pay MORE money because workers couldn't get you to a bay in time. I wouldn't be as mad if this place was actually at capacity, but at least a fourth of the bays weren't even occupied while we were there. I guess it makes sense not to open all of the bays, because the longer patrons have to wait, the more money they'll have to spend on food and drinks. It's clear that this business is a complete money-grab that's taking advantage of patrons that have had to wait an excruciatingly long time just to play. On top of this, while we waited for our turn to play, it took us 20+ minutes (after asking for a waiter to come to our table) to get someone from the wait staff to take our drink orders. Hopefully I'll return at some point, but there's no way I could recommend this place without having to list the bad that goes along with it."}
{"text":"This place is great, kinda pricey! Food was above average. Only real negative very very busy, so had to wait 45 minutes."}
{"text":"It's a great experience for friends and family, only concern I have is how the food prices are way to high. But still LIT!!!!"}
{"text":"What a great place to spend a few hours with the family. We had no trouble parking and walked right in and got a bay on the first floor. Lauren was as helpful as could be in making sure we were well taken of. It was literally 115 degrees today but was comfortable at our bay. The food was so good. Highly recommend the margarita pizza and the shrimp. So good! We can be skeptical about new places as locals but this places lives up to the hype. We will be back soon!!! Thanks for a great night."}
{"text":"What a place!!! 
Fun - exciting - clean - great food and drinks!!
Service is always awesome!!"}
{"text":"I came into Top Golf for the first time the other night and it was so much fun! I would just like to make a shout out to all the employees at top golf, everyone is so friendly! But I would especially like to acknowledge our sever, Danielle G. She was so sweet and attentive! I ordered all of her recommendations and they were all amazing! (try the buffalo sliders and chicken tacos trust me). She was super helpful explaining the rules of the game. We had a blast! Everything exceeded my expectations and I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing time there. The service was on top of it and our appointment was right on time. I also had a golf pro help me out and it improved my swing by 500%(thank you Ryan). I also had 4 witness to that. So if you think u need help with your swing have a pro help."}
{"text":"You said 45 minutes, 3 hours ago. This place is nice for a beer and some basic appetizers but don't expect to actually hit a golf ball.  We just left after 3 hours. When we left they still said it was a 45 minute wait."}
{"text":"Very, very cool place!  With very, very expensive prices to go with it!  However, there is nothing else like it out there, so I guess they can charge what they want!  Just wish it was more reasonable for large families.  Make a reservation...the weekends are jammed pack!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to another top golf in the Chicagoland area and this scottsdale location is head and shoulders better. They said before this location they turned old driving ranges into top golfs but they built this one from the ground up. Ppl go just to hangout and not even play. Wait times can be 2.5 hrs on the wkends."}
{"text":"Scores would not record so it made it frustrating
We brought family here for the first time and it was disappointment 
Good service and good
Prices were average"}
{"text":"So much fun!! We took the kids and it was definitely fun for the whole family!  The staff was very attentive and helpful. There was a small glitch with our score board and the manager fixed it immediately and gave us free golf time. We went at the end of December and the heaters made it warm and comfortable."}
{"text":"I like top golf. It's fun. I first learned of it in Austin Texas. Only wish they had more options on the menu to chose from but overall not a bad place to spend some time with family from out of town. Not Enticing enough to go more often. I'd only go once a year."}
{"text":"This was my families second time coming here and we loved our experience even more than the first! The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. We were celebrating my brothers 21st birthday and they brought out the sweetest dessert for us to share. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Always A GOOD Time There. But Let Me Talk About The Food \"YOU WANT FLAVOR IT IS ALL THERE!\" Awesome Environment Awesome Staff. I Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"always wanted to see and try out this place and this year on our annual golf trip to vegas we made it one night.  definitely has the vegas vibe to it, but the bartenders their are a complete joke.  We tried ordering drinks before our station was ready but they don't acknowledge you until you as the customer have to get their attention and wave them down.  Besides the whole bar incident, everything else was a pleasant experience.  Our party of 6 got our range station and the waitress and host were amazing.  Very attentive and answered any questions we had.  expect to stay at least a hour and half to 2 hours depending on how fast your group hits/plays.  Drink/food prices are decent.  They let you use Callaway clubs which were in excellent condition.  I recommend you bring or buy a golf glove cause the grips get slippery.  not sure if we'd come back though, rather spend the money on a course."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I can't believe there aren't more of them. The wait was a little long since it's so popular but well worth it. Side note: I accidentally left my sunglasses at our bay and came back an hour later not expecting much. Andrew, one of the supervisors, was receptive and anxious to help me. We looked together at the bay but didn't see anything. He took my info and reported the incident to the staff. Just a few minutes later I got a call from Andrew saying they had found and turned in my sunglasses?! Obviously an honest staff most interested in repeat business through great service!"}
{"text":"Our last night in Vegas on a Sunday night And my bf really wanted to come here .. we were at planet hollywood and walked here.. we knew they closed at 1 am and we rushed to get here and yes prob should have just taken an uber! Got here exactly at 12:05 and the young lady met us at the door and told us we can't golf .. we would have gladly paid for full hour happily.. wish we could have done this and thought it was pretty messed up they wouldn't let us for only 5 minutes .."}
{"text":"My employer took our management team here to celebrate the end of the fiscal year. The food was pretty good. They put out a nice buffet with buffalo chicken wings and sliders, beef sliders, a couple other flavors of wings, and a veggie tray. The game itself was pretty fun. The best part was the staff. They were all energetic and helpful. They definitely contributed to the party atmosphere."}
{"text":"Such a fun night! Good times beating the boys at their own game. What do you get when you mix a dance club, a driving range, and darts??? TopGolf!!! I was against the concept before coming, but it really is a great time! Awesome service, and food was decent. Trey & Megan were fun :)"}
{"text":"Just got here - bays are wide open but they told us over an hour wait...sat down and it took a server 15 minutes to wait on us - service is horrible so far"}
{"text":"We had a great time with our family here! Highly recommend this for any level of golfer. Our server was Summer, she was amazing!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic service from Lucky and Kimberly!  bachelorette party...perfect fun"}
{"text":"I like to come in early and just wack the ball some. I enjoy having a never ending supply of balls and not having to walk around all over the place. The games are fun, although I wish they could come up with a golf game type game (where the computer randomly assigns you a hole and distance, like your on the course). But it's fun! 

The food is ridiculously good and fairly priced."}
{"text":"Since I am no a golfer and was here for my uncle's birthday weekend, we ordered brunch. Luckily my wife shared her chicken and waffle since the kitchen NEVER delivers my eggs Benedict. After many reminders that I still did not get my meal we told the waiter not to bother. They were out of doughnuts so for the 3 items we ordered we got one. I guess baseball is not the only place by where .333 is a good record."}
{"text":"Knocking off a star because of the pricey range fees and food/drink items. Otherwise, a fun place to hang out, play, eat, and drink. HINT: go between 9a-12p and save on range fees."}
{"text":"Mixed review. 5 stars Luxury oasis one day- No stars swarm of needs unmet locust people the next day!  Don't reserve - walk in, save $$.  Thursday this place was shangri-la. Had the place to ourselves- great hitting bays with the newest Calloway clubs. We brought our own Calloways which were about 2 years old- and made a direct comparison with the latest technology. Pools are 21+ and no smoking- which makes them paradise in this city.  But the following day- we were met in the parking lot by staff, telling us that something 'happened' which delayed the opening on Friday until noon. When we arrived back at noon- there was a sea of newly arrived unhappy tourists jammed in the lobby(some with luggage) - hot and complaining. Not enough staff on the job to process the large glut of people. Plus - there is no bag drop off on the first floor. You have to lug your clubs up a long flight of stairs to get to the lobby. Games concept here is far better than other TopGolf Venues- you rent the bay by the hour, and the ball dispenser is superior at this location. You never know what conditions you will encounter at this schizo location- so don't bother reserving. That way you can just go do something else."}
{"text":"The pricing for this top golf compared to others is outrageous! My wife and I are headed to Vegas and she doesn't golf so one bay is $90/hr for just me. I can almost play Pebble Beach for that hourly rate!!!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS FUN! Even if you dont know how to golf. The only downside is how long the wait is so be sure to plan for that if you go on a weekend. We got our name down and then went over the to the casino until they called us. The donut holes are delicious!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO!!!! Hands down worst place I have ever been to in my life. Every employee was extremely rude. The service was slow and the prices are outrages. DO NOT GO HERE unless you feel like being treated like scum and a second class citizen."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying, I'm no golfer. I've been to one other driving range before but didn't have much fun. By adding food and alcohol and knowing where you ball lands to get points, Topgolf just upped the ante! I had a lot of fun hitting some balls and beating my friends. Not bad for a first (second) timer. There are so many floors and things to do here so if you have a friend that doesn't enjoy hitting balls (I don't know how you wouldn't) they can drink or watch tv or go swimming in the pool. YES! There's a pool! It was raining when I was there so no one was swimming but it's there.
My only concern would be the type of food that's served here. Burgers, chicken wings and such. Finger foods aren't good to eat when you have to handle dirty clubs. I would suggest foods on a stick would be better to serve. Or order a salad. But boo! That's boring."}
{"text":"Would prefer to give this zero stars. I understand it's a new establishment, but the staff was unprofessional and overcharged us.

We reserved a table yet they made us wait over an hour and then promised to pay for our food, drink, and golf.... But then they didn't. This made for two hours of awkward conversations and ultimately our large party was extremely put off by Top Golf.

Would stay away until they have figured out their service kinks - clearly still a way to go"}
{"text":"After being told it would be an 1.5hours until we could be on the first level we decided to not go on the waitlist. We were also told there was a private event on the 3rd level. After declining the wait we wondering onto the third level only to discover the event was over and they were prepping the bays for general use. We then went back to the check in desk and let them know what we were told and after a few confused moments the head agent let them know the 3rd level was indeed available for the rental. Had a less than enthusiastic attendant take us up to our booth. Barely explained the games or process and left. The waitress took our 2 beer and one margarita drink order. Never asked anything else. Then as we paid our tab with minimal tip (based on the very sub par service) she asked us if 'that's it?' !! We explained that she didn't provide good service and our trip reflected so. Overall, a great set up with very poor customer service and organization. Loved the golf games. Very disappointed in the customer service."}
{"text":"This place is always chaotic.  Super super super busy, but that's because it's really fun!  As a girl, I know a lot of girls wouldn't be comfortable or have fun golfing at a \"driving range,\" but that's why Top Golf is so great, because even if you don't want to play, you can just hangout and eat/drink with your friends who are playing.  Whether you're coming here for a date, birthday party, in a big group, or whatever it may be, this place is great for people of all ages.  The atmosphere itself is really fun and it's just a super cool idea that's entertaining."}
{"text":"TopGolf should be called TopDollarGolf.

It would have gotten five stars if it weren't for the massive bill we received when we were ready to go. That shocked everyone. The food prices are reasonable and the drink prices are what you would expect for a spot off the Vegas Strip, but the golf prices are astronomical!

The views of The Strip from this place are great, the food is good, and the high-tech driving range is cool. It's like bowling where you rent a lane, but instead of paying per game, you pay per hour. Oh, and every player also needs to pay for a \"membership\".

We had a group of 15 and were there for about three hours. Some of us had food, some didn't. Most of us hit a few balls, some didn't. About half of us had food, so I estimated that our average food and drink bill per person was maybe $35, and that is stretching it. That means it cost over $675 for golf. That's $225 per hour! So each lane was $112.50 per hour. Maybe they added a huge tip into the bill, but we couldn't find it.

The place is fun, but not $1,200 worth of fun."}
{"text":"I have a good time when I go but my boyfriend who is only 19 can go and drink alcoholic beverages then they will look at his id and say we'll pretend we never saw this then he will drive back to surprise. You guys need to be strict on looking at ids at the beginning and not giving it to minors because you can be shut down."}
{"text":"Paid for all-inclusive premium bar package only to be surprised that a very simple drink was not included in the package. Not only did the server not inform the party of the fact that the drink was not included, but she also ordered additional drinks without being prompted thus incurring further charges. Great location, great product, very poor service."}
{"text":"Went there in May 2015 for my mother's birthday party. The party consisted of 12-15 people. My father pre-ordered quite a selection of food to be served buffet style.... He mistakenly ordered entirely too much food! Quite literally there was enough to feed 40-50 people easily. We had so much food in fact... Much to the chagrin of the staff, my dad offered food to the 8-10 college aged kids at the bay next to us which they were very delighted and accepted. There was so much food... Everybody was figuring out who was taking what but then \"the manager\" (what a tool) informed us we \"can't take any food home, it's against the health code\". If been to umpteen restaurants in Scottsdale and they always bring out a to-go box. I think the staff was extremely upset because they could see now that multiple bays next to us the guests were eating the \"catered food\" & was adversely affecting there business. Ridiculous. 
     Also, if you go there when it's hot, they have industrial unsightly misters that will do nothing but get your clothes damp/wet. My eyeglasses literally had to be wiped every 20 sec. When asked to adjust the settings, we were told there was \"nothing they could do\".
     Finally, if you like to golf enough to where you own your own clubs... BRING THEM!  The \"house clubs\" are so bad and beat up. Top golf couldn't have bought them at even at a second hand store. These clubs would be something you'd find in your grandfathers attic from circa 1972. Oh and BRING YOUR MONEY AND BE READY TO PART WITH IT!!!
Simply take a look around at their multi-million dollar facility. The customers pay dearly for it with their outrageous gouge pricing on everything"}
{"text":"We brought our legitimately drinking age kids here to show them sone fun...paid 50.00 for a vip, 5.00 for a stupid lifetime memberahip that means nothing and then 90.00 for 2 hours at a table to have dinner and pay more money for food and drinks....then becauae one of our legit sons had a vertical ID, they wouldnt give him a beer...the manager was rude...said ahe didnt want our business anyway and it didnt matter at all...i understand its the law but later found out, the got busted once and now are willing to pass up business and more money...so be it....will never go back...the general manager came out to apologize for the regular manager...apologized...but a day late and a dollar short...if ahe had handled it well she would have comped the wings and said i get it...how can i make you stay..instead of \" we dont give a crap\"....note to management....train your people to retain business instead of make them find other places to spend money."}
{"text":"1st level is \"ground\" level BELOW where you check in-and is not desirable in my opinion; there's no view and it feels secluded with lack of TV's and \"stuff going on\" you cannot really see the targets like on the higher elevated levels.  Choose at least level 2. 

Be careful about where you park!  Staff put a fence behind my car and I was blocked in on all sides by cars & the fence. They acted like they were doing me a favor be letting me leave.  

DO NOT CHOOSE TO DELAY YOUR CHECK-IN TIME!
We were told it would be 90 minutes so we ordered food. The moment the food arrived we got a text saying we could check in so we picked the option to delay checkin by 15 minutes.  Apparently 15 minutes is not Really 15 minutes.  We were put back on a wait list which took about 35 minutes more.  

Service is pretty poor overall.  Very disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this facility out and for Fathers Day my wife and son set an hour session up online. We arrived to a big line waiting on the stairs to get in, to be told we had to buy a\"lifetime membership\".I thought that was odd.

 We waited for an hour and the other feature is they want your driving license, which they claim makes it easy to populate your membership into the computer. Not convinced about that. 

Once we were signed in we went to a third level bay. The hostess ran through the basics too quickly, but we figured it out. It was a lot of fun and a clever use of technology to track your shots. 

We ordered some basic brunch items which were fresh, hot and tasty. Cocktails are expensive. Beer not bad.

My wife thought it was $25 per person before noon, but that was 1 hr in the bay. Good value actually.  We had fun and even being outside in June, the mister fans worked really well to keep you cool. 

All in all a great experience.  We will go back in the evening and maybe they will get 5 stars. Good job so far TG."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Expencive but if you have 4 more people it is worth it.  Better if you go as a work function."}
{"text":"Not a happy customer...who just wanted to relax and destress and hit some ballz. FIRST COMPLAINT is the horrible valet drivers that top golf states \"it's a 3rd party company\". Almost got into a fight with a valet guy for doing nothing but go the wrong way. Then before getting kicked out, I met the manager....who did nothing to resolve the issue but said i can play here and he gave me his business card. Wow. Don't know what I am suppose to do with a business card, but thanks. 
All in all, it's overpriced for hitting 5 balls with 4 other friends in 60 mins for big $$$$'s. It's a cool place I give them that, but as a local I'll go somewhere else, thank you very much."}
{"text":"Never thought I would love golf, but I sure love this place!!! Good food, service has always been on point too. Can't say there is a signature drink that was amazing but maybe they will come up with one in the future lol we will be back"}
{"text":"Had an awesome time here for my first visit. I will be coming back with my boyfriend as soon as we can! Went for a girls night and it was the perfect idea. We had so much fun being silly...none of us are any good at golf!"}
{"text":"Way too much fun.  Drinks, couches and hitting golf balls.  Seriously.  Service awesome and experience awesome."}
{"text":"This place has gone from a great place to hit golf balls to one of the worst.  You can no longer hit any type of driver, fair way club (3,5 or 7 wood) or any hybrid club. This goes for women too.  Additionally if you want to use your own clubs, irons only, you can only hit from the bottom floor, which on a busy night is impossible to get an open bay. I guess it's back to Crackerjax's!!!!"}
{"text":"HELLA FUN. just sayin'. they have a bar, a swimming pool, and a driving range. what else do you need? i would recommend going with a few buddies for a chill day to get the hangover away and get that stress from a night of losing money out of you. the recharge is def worth it. the price for the afternoon and later is slightly pricey but it's vegas. what do you expect? i had a good time and the fact that alcoholic drinks are available is unheard of. if there was an option for 6 stars, they would get it. creative and smart business."}
{"text":"Best Top Golf in the valley.   Got the membership and my wife and I use it 1 to 2 times a week and always enjoy it.   The wait staff is great and do an outstanding job.   Because of its popularity, we do avoid it on Friday and Saturday nights,  but always enjoy it during the week, especially in the morning.  Have had a recent negative issue with the Scottsdale location and will not go back there,  but I love the Gilbert Top Golf.   Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Decided on a Monday morning to try Top Golf in Scottsdale.   They open at 9 am and don't take reservations.   I arrived at 10:30 am and was told there would be a 30 minute wait.   I asked why the wait since I could clearly see many empty bays.   I was told that they could not assign a bay unless there was wait staff available to provide beverage and food service.  I have never had this issue at other Top Golf locations and as a member, use Top Golf 1 to 2 times per week
After discussions with several managers at increasing levels of responsibility I was finally assigned a bay.   Took about 20 minutes of complaining.   I love Top Golf but willl not go back to this facility."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is cool but I would rather spend 40 bucks on a twilight round that would last me 2 hours for 9 holes vs 40 bucks for 1 hour. To me prices are super inflated! Its a golf range you can drink at lets be honest."}
{"text":"Check in was so frustrating. The line moved very quickly but once it was our turn to check in it took THIRTY MINUTES even tho we are already members, due to the staff not knowing how to use the computer system. 3 different people tried to help her but nobody was able to efficiently problem solve. The  40 people behind us all passed us and then we were told to be patient because they are short staffed. At 11am on a Sunday. Really cruddy customer service."}
{"text":"We went yesterday and had great time.  Me and a friend and our two 14 year old daughters.  Neither know how to golf but we had a blast.  Food was also very good with great service."}
{"text":"Service sucks. Waited at a dirty table for 15 minutes .. seated ourselves , it took another 15 for our order to be taken. Give dirty utensils, use caution , before putting food on your fork here . Fun place . MANAGEMENT needs to do a lot more with their staff etc"}
{"text":"Super fun! I didn't realize how much I loved golf until I came here! The food was delicious and they had a wide variety. The servers came but very often, always eager to get you anything you need, and there were large fans, so it didn't get too hot out!"}
{"text":"I have never played golf before even though I've been meaning to learn. This place is a lot of fun though. I enjoy being able to pick different games to play and it's a pretty cool concept. Definitely a positive that it's unlimited balls for the driving range- you just pay for the amount of time per hour. We usually have 3-4 people per bay for an hour and that gives you about 2.5 rounds of play but that also depends how fast you're playing.

Once you check in, they took you over to a bay. At the bay, there's a seating area and a TV, and you can order food and drinks. The food is ok nothing special but suitable for munchies and the drinks are standard. It's a little pricey but it's Vegas and you're on the strip so it's expected. We usually request the 2nd floor because the 1st floor is pretty boring to hit from and the 3rd floor costs more.

As for the whole venue, it's actually really big and spacious with 3 stories. The 2nd floor has a full bar and a lounge area to watch sporting events. It's a fun place to come hang out while you're waiting for your bay.

I would definitely recommend this place to golfers and those that have never played golf too. It's a good time and a chill spot to hang out at."}
{"text":"Great place to have friends meet up and hit a few balls. Food was good not great but good. However the bar and server side of it can use a little work. Bartender was not very knowledgable of how to make cocktails, instead of arguing with the guest please just give them what you ask for. We were over charged in our group for two drinks but we didn't bring it up. The server/cocktail staff were walking around with dead faces like zombies but I don't blame them for working long hours in the summer heat. Last but not least I walked to the bar on the lower floor asked for a beer on tap by name and even pointed at it, the bartender (female) repeated my beer order to me and still poured the wrong beer lmao.. How do you do this.... It was too awesome, her response to me was oops I think I poured the wrong one and quickly put the glass in the lower cooler. I will defiantly be back. Fun place just need more experienced staff?"}
{"text":"If you plan on consuming alcohol here be sure you have a horizontal valid drivers license. The concept of TopGolf is cool but this review I primarily to say customer service was not the best and very inconsistent. The point system is messed up and doesn't read properly. Here is my story: I walked in with my fiancé and some family members. After being told it was a 3 hour wait for our bay we decided to get some food and drinks. Everyone was carded and received the drinks we ordered, we then also ordered some food. We received a text that our bay was ready way before 3 hours. As we are about to head to our bay our food comes. No one offered to deliver our food and we also were charged more for our bill (later we were charged properly). We go up to our bay and ordered some drinks for while we play. The waitress tells my fiancé that she can not serve her alcohol because her VALID US DRIVERS LICENSE is past 30 days from when she turned 21. (Our licenses do not expire until 2019 so there is no need to get a horizontal license and we have been receiving alcohol our entire vacation). The managers eventually came and were very rude about the situation. Our group understands the drinking laws of Arizona but our point is we were literally served alcohol earlier in our visit to TopGolf. In the end it was a lot of fun besides the first hour we spent there. The place is super disorganized and needs a to understand the concept of customer service. Our point is make the rules of the establishment consistent in the entire building. If you have made it this far, thanks for reading. If you are an employee of TopGolf please do not contact me as I am uninterested in any thing you have to say.

Taren, I understand that it's a law by the state of Arizona but our point is you DID serve us with our vertical IDs just moment before we went upstairs."}

{"text":"I love this place but have been here 4/5 times and have had horrible service every time!  I sat at my bay for 20 min with no acknowledgment and previous times waited over 10 minutes to get drinks I ordered!  I hope management sees this!"}
{"text":"My first Topgolf experience.  Staff very attentive & helpful. I came to practice my short game. I'm left handed & they had clubs. This was their opening day.  This is a very nice facility with 3 or 4 levels to handle large groups. The golf set up is only for right handers. It wasn't bad but not the most optimum setup. I'd recommend  Topgolf to any visitor to Las Vegas. Great activity with friends."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Top Golf, and I brought two family members visiting for the holidays.  The overall concept is quite fun - as an activity alone, we would rate this 5 stars - it is REALLY fun and something you can imagine yourself doing over and over as a social event.  Why two stars, you ask?

There are major issues with this place that test your patience.  First off, when you walk in, its total pandemonium (we came here at 3pm on Friday).  There are two line queue's but no signage or help as to what the lines are for, or where to even stand in line.  As it turns out, the first line is the \"membership line\" - everyone needs a $5 membership.  

The second line, is to \"check in\" - by which they scan your new membership card and ask whether you want a bay on a specific floor.  

Both of those tasks sound SO easy - and they should be - yet we still waited in line for about 40 minutes to accomplish these two tasks.  The entire time, we and everyone else in line are talking about how inefficient this place is and you would think the managers would see this once, and rearrange things to make it easier.  After all, we really wanted a beer - we could have been through two rounds at the bar in the same amount of  time we spent waiting around to check in.  

After all that, we still went to the bar and had two rounds while we waited.  Good selection of beer, bartenders were fast to see that we wanted booze and wasted no time in getting it.  

Then, we get our text message - our bay is ready, requiring us to go muscle into the line and tell the check in staff we are ready (which then irritates everyone in line because you are obviously butting in), but thats the way they like it here I guess.  

We head to our bay with a \"bay concierge\" that gives us the down low on the mechanics of play.  Its not the most intuitive thing in the world, but it works.  

We start hitting balls and our waiter shows up.  He literally walks us through the entire menu, page by page, explaining burgers, and appetizers, and frozen margaritas like we had never been to a pub before and didn't know what a \"slider\" was.  (Mind you, you pay by the hour at this place, so someone taking your time is quite annoying).  We order a bucket of beer and chips and guac, and shoo him off and get back to our golf.  Beers arrive, chips arrive - and our waiter arrives..... and stays.... and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from, and his Grandma in Colorado, and what it was like working after Christmas, and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about.  ugh, leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer, not a new pal.

When the chips came out, one in my party leaned over to the server and said, \"do you know one thing thats missing in this place?\"  The server leaned in all interested.... \"napkins - there are no napkins on the table\".  Our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag, and on and on and on..... and no napkins.  He stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him, \"could we have napkins?\" - and there was this 'oh yeah' moment - he was oblivious at times.

So, we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips, and he comes back with the beer, and no chips (and again, all chatty - does this guy have other tables?).  The refill of chips took about 20 minutes.  We came at an odd time, and we were expected home for dinner, but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good.

The kicker though, was that near the end of our session, our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after Christmas, there was a five hour wait, and they ran out of food, and booze, and kegs, etc.  He told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing.  He asked us if we wouldn't mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks, and he would buy us desert if we said yes.  

OK, this is the business guy in me coming out now, but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to IMPROVE and figure out where you are failing.  The fact that you have a 40 minute check in process, or that you ran out of beer one night, or that there are no napkins on the table, or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are ALL issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead, they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated.  If I owned this place, I would be PISSED off.   

Again, its a really fun concept, but it will try on your nerves big time."}

{"text":"My family and I come here almost twice a week and find the place very relaxing and fun. We've had many servers and different experiences, but today was definitely one of the worse. After waiting an hour, we got our bay and waited a moment for a friend to get out of the restroom (which would have been no more than 5mins) before we started our time... We were approached by a manager who told us we had to start our time RIGHT THEN and couldn't wait for our friend. The man took my credit card and attempted to add time as my friend was coming back, I don't understand why he couldn't have waited 5 minutes for our friend when they hold bays longer than that..... Very unprofessional in my opinion.... After we got all started, we waited 10 minutes to be greeted by our server who finally got us some drinks and our food order in. That was the last we saw of her until the end of our time... No drink refills, no checking up on us or anything. We had to have a sever look for her to check us out.... Turns out she was sitting at another bay chatting with friends.... Other than this experience , we've all loved top golf! Hopefully someone from top golf reads this and is able to correct these unprofessional staff members of theirs..."}
{"text":"One of the best entertainment venues around! Just went to the VIP party and I was absolutely impressed. Arcade style golfing with great music, food, drinks, and friendly staff.... I'm hooked! 

The venue itself is impeccable, flat screen TV's everywhere you look, pool tables, football, the top deck bar, oh and let's not forget, the golf. The setup is perfect for groups, this place has something for everyone. 

The food was such high quality I thought I was eating at a 5 star restaurant. The selection of drinks was impressive to say the least, from custom cocktails to a wide variety of draft options. 

The staff was super friendly and eager to help at a moments notice. They also had great personalities, many of them danced as different songs came over the rocking sound system. Everyone seemed to love working at this place so much that my girl is considering a part time job here haha. 

The golfing itself is arcade style meaning they have various games to challenge all skill levels. Some people in our group had never golfed before and absolutely had a blast learning the basics. 

Bottom line is, thank you TopGolf for coming to Gilbert, AZ. I will see you often!
Let's Play!"}

I ran into a server that knew me by name and asked why I wasn't going anymore which I explained why and her response was yeah I wouldn't trust the kitchen.  I think I will stick to normal driving ranges for now on."}

It makes it really fun for people who are good drinkers..(me) and bad golfers..(me)

Then after sitting at that table for over 20 minutes someone finally came over to take a drink order. Mind you the bar was less than half full. After that another 20 minutes went by for them to come and take a food order then we waited another 20 minutes to 30 minutes for our food to arrive and mine was wrong. The atmosphere was good but the service in the bar needs a lot of work.  I was a little disappointed to say the least. I had heard great things about it and was excited to try it."}

They have a good selection of beer and food. The deep fried pickles are so good and crispy! They also come in a cute little basket.

I know this seems stupid but I don't understand why they don't have toilet seat covers in any of their bathrooms, for the amount of people that come here you would think they would have them. But other than that!
We love top golf!!"}
{"text":"I have been to TGLV a few times now and I am really impressed. .  My motivation was different than most.  I was looking for a Callaway fitting location and found TGLV. Impressive facility with great people.  This place makes golf fun for anyone with any skill level.  Food was great and beer was cold.  I didn't go during prime time but this looks like the place to be on a weekend night.  I want to specially compliment their Director of Instruction Sean Solodovnick  If your serious about improving your game I high recommend seeing Sean. Huge improvement for me."}
{"text":"Junior golfers look elsewhere.  

The front desk and \"Concierge\" (and I put those in BIG quotes) and check in staff is like a bunch of teenagers at the mall.  They are just there to take up space and annoying you.   Inconsistencies were everywhere. We are told that no one can bring drivers. OK.  I'm fine with that.  But I see about 5 bays with hackers swinging their drivers.  I inquire about the obvious inconsistency with 2 different staff members and their response was \"oh I'm sure the manager will tell them to stop.  There's nothing we can really do about that.\"  

But they insist I walk my clubs back to the car and stow my hybrids.  REALLY?  My son who is 4 wanted to use his driver so he hit a whopping 30 yards.  Nope she said everyone is held to the same standards.  OK robot...but did you just tell me there's NOTHING you can do about those guys using their drivers???  

Dont' claim to be junior friendly when it's the complete opposite.  Golf is a dying sport as it is...let's find a new way to make it even less appealing for them.  The definitely should revisit their junior policy to something that makes common sense.  Anyone under 10 can use their driver doesn't seem that out of the world to me.  And adhere to the rule you \"impose\".   I saw at least 3 other kids with their drivers and no one telling them to put it away.  When we finally got to our bay, the \"concierge\" guys said \"I woulda let your little guy use his driver...the rule is totally stupid.\"  And so I'm thinking...oh so the rule is dependent on who sees you walk into the door.  Take my advice...sneak in your drivers all you want.  I should have.  

The waitress service was nice and prompt.  Food was better than expected.  Facility in top condition.  Too bad junior robots run the front."}
{"text":"Perfect place to go and have a few drinks with friends! I go here almost every weekend  I was usually never disappointed until One weekend there was an off duty employee who was cursing loud. Loud enough for everyone around to hear."}
{"text":"I'll start with TopGolf is a fun place to hang out. The facility itself is well put together from the furniture, lounge, bars, view, etc. There's no doubt that this is overall a very cool place. However, I am unimpressed with the staff/service. Being a local I am very understanding of service in vegas - good and bad. I am easy going when service is bad, but also extremely appreciative when service is good. I will say that I am very critical on service because I have worked behind and in front of the bar as well as managed restaurants and other departments. 
With all that being said, me and my girlfriend were excited to check out TopGolf since we've never been. When we arrived we were hungry so we decided to check everything out to get our bearings, eat, and then play. We were approached by a women (who I didn't catch her name) she was very helpful and started to explain where everything was until we were interrupted by a gentleman who said that he would take us up. He introduced himself (keone) and asked us if we worked at SLS, and confused we said, no, and kept walking. I questioned where we we're going and what we were doing. I wasn't sure if he thought we were someone else or if he was just showing us the facility. I was kind of ignored and we kept walking. He sat us at a bay and then came back with three other girls to join our group... which us or the other girls were not expecting. We were all very confused because at some point he thought we asked for bay 302. Which was completely wrong we never said a word about meeting any one or had said the number 302 because we didn't even know that it existed. Keone literally came out of no where and told us to follow him. To make matters worse, he tried to put us at his friend's bay who was an older gentleman that was there by himself next to where he sat us to make up for the confusion. He said that it was okay and we can order whatever we want. It was just really uncomfortable and awkward. I'm pretty sure that he was a manager which made it weirder. We both were being very nice and took a couple swings thanked them for their time, but we really just wanted to go get some lunch.
We went to the nearest bar and was greeted by bartender, Agnes. We were the only two at the bar, and then shortly after 3 other gentlemen came and sat for some drinks. I ordered the strawberry jalapeno margartia. Since I have bartended I like to watch how my drinks are made, and it was very apparent that Agnes was an inexperienced bartender. Which, to her defense, she may have been trained to make her cocktails a specific way, but she really just exuded lack of confidence behind the bar. She built the cocktail with ingredients, dropped some cut up strawberries, rolled the drink a few times, and poured it over ice. The strawberries weren't muddled, and the cocktail wasn't shaken with any ice. Again, she may have been trained that way, but the cocktail was so mediocre and aesthetically unappealing. It just seemed lazy to me. Agnes lacked personality, she barely spoke, wasn't very attentive, and didn't really smile. We ordered our food. I asked for no onions on my burger.... got onions. I ended up picking it off myself. It's just annoying because it was slow and she only had 5 people sitting at her bar and we were the only 2 eating which means that it was a careless mistake. If it was a full bar and you're getting your butt kicked I can understand forgetting to type in \"no onions\". The food was extremely delicious, and they have great options on their menu!
So, I'd say the first hour of being there was just so awkward and annoying just from the staff/service alone. We finally get checked in and are waiting to be walked to our bay. The girl at the check in didn't have much personality either she lacked confidence as well. Everything seemed a bit unorganized. We get walked to our bay, and I wish I remembered her name, we finally had someone with personality that was cracking some jokes, and made me laugh. We finally played some TopGolf and was having a good time. We went when it was 108 degrees outside @4pm. I assumed that there would be AC which it looks like it was set up, but it wasn't on/working. 

The game itself was a lot of fun. A bit pricey, but I didn't mind spending the money. The staff seems inexperienced/lost, and it shows that there wasn't a lot of fundamental training done or guidance from management. The employees just seem really socially awkward/goofy which is okay, but there has to be some level of professionalism. Hopefully they tie up loose ends with staff so that everything is seamless from check in - ordering - check out and farewell."}
{"text":"Well horrible first visit. ...xoxo don't get a waiter to save our life. Finally grab someone to some, nothing then grab someone else just to be told it's not my table.  Then order drinks, they a are the wrong ones and then takes another 20 minutes to get the right ones. Talked to manager and all taken care of."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out with friends and have few drinks. The golfing experience here is comparable with bowling."}
{"text":"Fun place for a party. 
Don't eat any of the uncooked food like lettuce, cold slaw, .... !!! Food handling is a big issue."}
{"text":"Can't use your own hybrids, woods or Driver, which is weird since you can hit the woods and driver they provide. Not really a driving range to work on your golf game. ts more so a bar where you can hit golf balls."}
{"text":"We have had a lot of fun here with friends.  This place is huge and waiting to get a bay is typically at a minimum.  Not too pricey if you have a few people chip in.  Drinks are kind of expensive at the bar.  Fun place to spend a few hours or an evening."}
{"text":"I took my two sons here and we all had the best time.  They loved it but they were upset because I beat them in golf....lol.  They were trying to hit the ball to hard.  My game was to hit the ball closer to the holes... I then got more points.  BIG HINT...."}
{"text":"Great facility, horrible service. We had a bd party for kids, 20 guests (kids and adults) and one server. It took our server 1 hour to bring \"unlimited\" drinks, one hour to find a cork screw to open wine, the monitor never synced up the names...."}
{"text":"Coming from San Diego for the weekend came in on a Saturday. The wait was 45 minutes to an hour which was all good figured we would just grab some drinks while we wait. Upon ordering a drink at the bar was told vertical (VALID) driver licenses of legal drinking age are not accepted by top golf policy. When we asked the bartender the specifics she was  extremely not polite and couldn't explain the reasoning although she confirmed the drivers license was valid and the member of our party was infact 22. Following when ordering a pitcher of beer we were \"helped\" by another extremely not polite bartender. We were excited to take our friends here but really disappointed by the service and the employees. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I love top golf. You can literally have never swung a Golf Club in your life and still enjoy your time here. The environment is always full of energy, and I've noticed that they periodically do themed events with staff. In my opinion, the cost of the individual bay is beyond reasonable, especially split up amongst a group. The drinks and food can add up though, which is probably to be expected. The music is always great. I haven't tried them yet, but I know they have other activities available, like Wii, pool tables, and a few others I cant recall. Definitely a good time, whether for a work outing, birthday event or even a nice first date!"}
{"text":"Went on a packed Sunday but surprisingly did not have to wait long. Staff were knowledgeable, friendly, and organized. We brought our kids who had a ton of fun. We ordered snacks and drinks and they were good. Going at sunset makes for a great view and you get to experience the fairway lights at night."}
{"text":"This a fun activity if you have the spare cash to spend, as this place is on the more pricey side. Be prepared to get decent food that might seem a little over priced. If you plan on drinking be ready to get your wallet out. Plan on inviting multiple people to join you, I suggest gathering out in front of the front doors, as the lobby area tends to be very loud and cramped. Also, send your people the instructions on what to expect when they arrive as the process of checking in takes more than 10 minutes and involves two different counters in the lobby."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. I am in Phoenix on vacation. Cool place to golf, too bad the interactions with staff aren't up to the challenge. We were given a twenty minute wait time. They said they would text when our turn was up. Thirty minutes later-no text. We went and checked and they said  they text five times. We showed them our phone with no texts.  And the dude said \"oh yea, well, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.\" No sorry, no embarrassment. They did not care. That was one example I have others that I won't put here. Customer service is dead! I should stop caring."}
{"text":"overall a great experience. a little over staffed.  I think the scoring system may have miscalculated a little. you can pick different games to play. we went as a party of 4 in a bay and was perfect! I wish I didn't have to give my cc info so many different times. I had to give it initially and then to open tab and then to extend the game. Two hours is perfect! Food was okay. we had chips and salsa, buffalo chicken egg rolls, and chili cheese fries. the bartender did try to give us another tables beers. The staff was okay, very awkward with some of the staff just standing around, it made it uncomfortable to approach about being a first timer."}
{"text":"Very very fun. Food and drink prices were no where near as expensive as some casino restaurants and clubs/bars. Very friendly and attentive staff. They have a pool, good for private parties. Very cool GPS technology with golf balls. Lots of bar, lots of places to sit and mingle, there was even a live band. Love this place."}
{"text":"If you are serious about golf and care about the competition I wouldn't recommend coming here unless you have your own clubs. The default selection they have is a joke and for someone that uses steel clubs you're screwed if you've never hit graphite clubs. 

Other than that the atmosphere is great and it's fun to drink and hit balls but don't count on playing competitively unless you have your own clubs."}
{"text":"For non-golfer this is really fun! We had the top floor I would recommend this level. I waited rylan was friendly and awesome! The food is ok but they have a full bar which makes up for it ! This place is a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"I like this place, and would like it more if I could go there more often. I know it's popular, but it's always PACKED, often with 20 somethings. It's a great idea for a fun night out, but go early if you don't want to wait hours!"}
{"text":"I went to topgolf with some friends from out of town. They have a 6 year old girl and were only in town for a few days so I decided to take them here because I had heard good things. All of the praise was well deserved. The service was great and he golf game accommodated all levels of golfing prowess. From the 6 year old who had never swung a golf club to my brother that has played for years. I would recommend it to anyone as a good place to get some drinks and have some fun. Like others have said, as far as activity type, it's much closer to bowling than golf."}
{"text":"It's like a bowling alley for golf!  Beautiful outdoor patio, family friendly, reasonable priced food and broad menu choice  The service was fantastic and the self injectible donuts are simply delicious (sounds crazy, I know)"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday for my younger brothers birthday. Waited about an hour for 2 bays but we hung out in the restaurant and drank. None of us golf at all but we had a great time! Can't wait to go back and check it out again."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The food is awesome and so is the staff. They're always so energetic and excited for their guests. They are also a very charitable organization and actively donate to many charities and help those in need."}
{"text":"Had a blast. Came on a Saturday night, host said 2 hour wait. We only waited an hour. Management very attentive and friendly. Will be back again."}
{"text":"I had a great time playing golf with my girlfriend on Valentine's Day. Our server came over letting us know that he would be dropping by every now and then if we had any questions. I wanna point out that he never once came by again, I went to the bar to order and appetizer, they told me it would be put in 10 minutes. Went back a half an hour later to get told that the kitchen is now closed. I was pretty understanding, so I went ahead and asked for a beer instead. \"Bar closes at 11:30.\" This is what I get in response, once again I'm understanding coming from customer service. Then I check my phone to see if my girlfriend had asked for anything and it was 11:20. So not only did the incompetent piece of Shit not get me my appetizer, the bar tender wouldnt take 10 seconds to pour me a beer. To top the entire night off, I was told I would pay 45 dollars and I could play till close. Ended up getting charged 90$, didn't get an appetizer I had ordered, couldn't get a beer cuz the bar closed in 2 minutes. Overall I will not be returning to this location, the customer service here is an absolute joke. If you want your money's worth, head to Gilbert. Unless all you wanna do is smack some golf balls."}
{"text":"Our server, DeShaswn, was great. He's attentive, energetic, & fun. Our food & drinks were good too. We're definitely coming back to Top Golf."}
{"text":"I was skeptical of this place going in, but I must admit I was genuinely surprised. The food was great, I took a dip in the pool and enjoyed the drinks as I watched all my friends whack some balls. The night I went they had a live band which was nice compared to yet another Vegas \"club mix\". Next time I'm in Vegas... I'll go back and bring a few more friends!"}
{"text":"Our party arrived at 11:15 am today, when the price is $25. The place was packed. We waited in line to become life time members at $5 each (membership is required), then waited in another line at the concierge's desk. We were told it would be 45 minutes to get to our spot. Since we would not be able to begin our fun, it would be after the 12:00 cut off for the price increase from $25 to $35. Whatever. So we decide to wait in the game and TV room. The waiter, Dan, came and took our drink orders. He brought them about 10 minutes later and we ordered appetizers and one of us ordered ice cream. Plus, 3 waters were ordered. Nothing ever came. About 35 minutes later we asked Dan where everything was. He said he'd check, and we also asked for the water. Another 20 or so minutes went by, and our group was called to report to our spot. Suddenly, Dan was there!! He wanted to make sure we got our food and said it would be delivered to us. At this point none of us even cared about our food. Within minutes, the food appeared, like magic!! I asked him again, for the 3rd time, for water. About 10 minutes later, the water arrived, along with 2 beers which had been ordered. So to sum up, when you get there, bring your own food and drink because by the time you get it it will be time to leave. I did see a sign in the ladies room they are having a hiring event on March 22. Maybe they don't have enough employees right now. I'm certain they don't have enough cooks, and they definitely had poor customer service today! Anyway, the golf part was fun but we were on the very bottom floor. One of the people I was with said it's more fun to be on the floors above. You'd certainly get a better view. I liked the TVs since it was the first day of March Madness. This location is crazy busy. I have heard the Gilbert location is not as busy. I doubt I will go back to this location. I think i will just go to a driving range at a local golf course and hit balls. I don't need all the glamour and Scottsdale fanciness this place has."}
{"text":"Topgolf is a hole in one!

Opening weekend...who knows what we're walking into.

-Parked the car (parking might be quite difficult depending on day and time you're here)(There is also valet)
-Waited in line to get a membership for $5 (45 minutes in the sun)
-Waited in line to get a bay (Saturday evening...opening weekend)(20 minutes)
-Escorted to our bay and given some instructions and advice (friendly and helpful)
-Started whacking away as our server came and introduced himself
-Ordered drinks...kept whacking
-Extended our time to order more drinks and continue the whacking
-Paid and left

What a great night! Sure...there will be kinks to work out of such a sizable and busy place. The place is an affordable date night, a fun place to come with friends or an interesting place to do some team building.

The golf range and games are incredibly fun. Even a novice will appreciate the simplicity of arriving with just themselves, finding clubs labeled to help them out, and games that are easy to understand. That horrible \"sorta\" swing will get better...I promise! You may have your neighbors trying to be friendly helpers though.

The service was as expected. They are busy. If you're the type of person that can't evaluate situational probabilities...don't write a review about how slow things are. If you didn't expect things to be a bit slower based on the parking lot and lines...maybe your expectations of divine intervention on the service is the problem.

There is music, television and wi-fi. There's a live DJ on the roof and it's essentially a night club later in the night. Be warned however, this place is loud at night! If you're looking to discuss business here...you might want to find somewhere a bit quieter.

My advice to Topgolf: More craft beer on tap...and a broader selection.

Topgolf is top notch!


Try: Coming here for date night

Avoid: Bringing the kids in the evening"}
{"text":"It's nice they have food but I would say it's more about having a couple drinks and driving a few balls. It is a fun alternative to eating out!"}
{"text":"I decided to celebrate my son's bday on a Friday evening, so I go to topgolf that day at noon to get information about the wait time, whats the best thing to do and so forth.  So they suggest for me to call before I take my party to topgolf to have a better idea of the wait time.  I call around 6pm and I was told that there was no wait time and that if I get there now, I will be given a booth up on the 3rd level (which I had asked about earlier in the day).  So my party and I get there at 7pm (which I understand that we were going to have a wait because it was an hour later).. once we get there they inform us that it will be an 1 hr to 1 1/2 hr wait time.  So we decided to go eat dinner somewhere close by.  We get back to topgolf around 8pm, we check in and they tell us it will be a 30-45 min wait time.  We said okay we'll hang out upstairs 3rd floor where the DJ area is at.  ONce we got up there, we notice a couple of booths opened and notice a family was escorted to a booth.  We ask them how long their wait was and they said 10 MINUTES!!!!.  however they said because they have a premium/platinum membership, which we understand that they pay $$$$$ for that.  So we said okay, whatever.  My husband goes downstairs to check on our wait time and they said that there are 10 guest in front of us so it will be another HOUR or so.  It was already 9:30pm.  We didn't get a booth until almost 10:30pm and the only reason was because my husband went almost 4 times to guest services and told them, to be honest with him and tell him if we are going to get seated or we just leave.  They give you the runaround about the wait time!!! I had to wait almost 3 HOURS on Friday evening.  I felt that we were given the worst booth because of our complaint.  WE were put on the booth next to wall!!"}
{"text":"I didn't have a great experience here, I feel like the entertainment they have is great. The golfing is nice but it could have better service. The food is great and it has an awesome ambiance."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is great and there's such a variety of cocktails! The emery is so positive and it's a great outing for all ages. Hands down one of my favorite places in charlotte. They cover all bases!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go...hit some balls, get a little competition going and have some good food and great drinks!!  always fun!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time and we went with my family and a friend. We got the middle section on the middle row was an awesome experience. We went on Valentine's Day too and was less busy then I thought. The service was great and then didn't mind us ordering lots of fries! They were also able to get me left handed clubs since a few other golf places dont acquire it. Coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Another great visit, what a great venue!!! We had a blast playing for a few hours getting drinks and food. All was great. Only thing I noticed is that the golf balls hit very dead. They are probably getting old and have been hit a lot?? Did. It really matter though, we had a great time!! Put one in the Seattle area!!!!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE if you expect good food, good service, an accurate golf machine, drinks, food or your bill that come to you in a timely matter.  This place is a total joke.  NO ONE knows what they are doing there.  The people around us got food that was ours and then we had to wait another 1/2 hour to get our food which was cold and disgusting. You will be sorry you spent a penny here."}
{"text":"Food took forever and it was dead..I thought the kids who worked here were rude, Loud and had 0 manners... but my server was okay the kid serving my food was nice and then my (okay) margarita sank in as soon as Kanye West played so now I'm over it and that saved  the experience. Ps. GO TO THE SCOTTSDALE ONE."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Everyone was super friendly and the games are way fun. A tip: go early in the day and with a group of friends. It's not nearly as busy and when you split it up it's very affordable. Still no drivers allowed but that's okay. The range is only about 215 yards long so hitting the targets doesn't need a lot of power. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The actual golf was fun, that part I enjoyed.  The problem I had was with the service in the bar.  Two friends and myself decided to eat lunch inside before heading to the bay to golf.  We promptly placed our order at that's where everything went downhill....

-after 30 min I had to flag someone down to bring us our waters and drinks
-after 60 min our food showed up w no silverware or napkins.  We asked for some, and received 1 set....yes, we had to then ask for two more sets.
-we then asked to speak w a manager, who asked what we wanted, let us explain what happened, asked ZERO follow-up questions, said \"thank you for the feedback\", and walked away.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!!!!!  Nothing, no empathy, no apology, no interest in digging in to what happened.  \"Thank you for the feedback\".  

Like I said, I enjoyed the golf experience, but would never step in that bar again.. Great Customer service is a culture you foster,  and if the mgrs. don't understand it,  why would the servers?"}
{"text":"The good news is we only had to wait 90 minutes this time instead of three hours. Very nice facility very well-maintained. The negative is the organization from a management standpoint seems very disorganized. We had a gift card to use and not only do they not work at the lane terminal but we had to ask 3 separate employees and stand in two separate lines before someone could help us use our gift card to pay. The probably would not of been nearly as frustrating and not just waited 90 minutes."}
{"text":"I gave 5 stars based on observation because we didn't have time to stay to play.  Each area is set up like a living room with cozy furniture, nice size TV and the people looked like they were having fun.  The drinks/food looked yummy and the people were definitely having fun regardless of their level/score/handicap."}
{"text":"The golfing is obviously the best part of this place.  The staff is friendly but why are there so many of them? They are like wolves when you walk in the door. There was literally 30 employees standing around talking,  so that's where your money is going.  It's basically 60 dollars an hour for a glorified driving range.  It also should not cost money to get a plastic card with your info on it. 

This place is fun but it will nickel and dime you for every cent you have.  I would not be coming here at all if I was a local."}
{"text":"I expected to pay $200 min in food and beverage but did not expect the exit interview with our server. She went over the bill then said the 7% service charge was not for her it was for the people on the back.  Then she wrote a $73 on the side of our bill and said this would be your tip.  Which would've been 30% on top of the 7% service charge.  I left $43 but was a little put off by this. Our servers name  was Jhoine D

Besides this we had a good time and the food was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Concept is awesome, basically a bowling alley version of a driving range. Setup and atmosphere are definite bright spots. Prices are tough to swallow - $60/hr after noon for 1st and 2nd levels, $75/hr for levels above 2nd. If you go w/ one other person, you end up probably hitting 50-55 balls each if you're both efficient. That kind of value is egregious. Plus they charge each person $5 for a membership card that is utterly useless. Absolutely zero user benefits w/ a membership card. 

We didn't order any food, but drink prices are decent. $28 for a beer pitcher which is respectable for Vegas. Only problem I had w/ that was I ordered a pitcher of Lagunitas and received Blue Moon or Shock Top instead. After questioning the beer, our server tasted it and gave us a sample of the \"Lagunitas,\" which was basically Blue Moon and kept insisting that it was an IPA. Appreciate the attempt at service, but they have problems distinguishing drinks. An IPA is very different from a light Belgian ale and you can even tell by the coloration. Other than that debacle, the Frozen Mule is pretty tasty. 

Overall, the environment can be a lot of fun, especially for larger groups like bachelor parties. But as stated before, the value is just atrocious. Ended up paying $70 for an hour after waiting 40 min for a bay."}
{"text":"Nice place, clean, good food, fun time, Can get a little expensive in smaller groups, so i would recommend party of four or more.  Can't bring in or use driver, wedges or hybrids, because the free way is to close.  Service was very good, servers are nice and always checking back to make sure you don't need anything.  Would prefer a standard driving range, but a good fill in to keep up your swing."}
{"text":"Brilliant! Food excellent, even had the chef visit the table when they found out we had allergies and was so accommodating. Service top notch! Great experience. Only thing is check to see if there's a band on as its abit off putting as its so loud, they were great band but ruined banter we were having as so loud. So maybe even golf on a different floor."}
{"text":"I love top golf the staff is always friendly and helpful the facility is always sparkly clean and it's a great way to spend a few hours outside without getting sizzled in the sun!!! I would def recommend this to any skill level golfer they also have a pool and games so it's great even if you come just to hang out and have a few drinks or lounge by the pool!"}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this place. Somehow they built it wrong and you can't bring or use woods or hybrids for balls will go over the fence. They would not let my 5 yr old bring hers- if she can hit it that hard I should check her on the pro tour. Then they have this crazy checkin system with 2 lines and you have to remember to bring your card from last time. Very antiquated. Second line for a bay. Strange
But once you are playing it is really cool - bar and wait service, decent prices and good food. Just not the place to actually practice your game. Only for social hour. The price is the same regardless how many players so good for a group. Expensive solo. Very loud"}
{"text":"I cant understand why people even write negative reviews about this place. Yes, the wait is long but that is why you plan accordingly. Yes, the food is nothing special but it's still worth buying. 

Even if you don't don't golf, this is a fun activity. Not for serious golfers, however. This is a great change of pace from standing around a bar or club. After your done with your play time, they have an awesome game room to continue the drunken shenanigans. 

I never pass up a chance to go here. It is too much fun!"}
{"text":"My first time here my boyfriend and I went to get a players card and after we bought that the lady checking us out didn't give any directions on what to do or where to go, like I said it was our first time there, so we had no idea what we were doing. Finally someone told us we had to go to the concierge to get a bay, so we did that it was a 45 minute wait, no big deal so we went to order some food while we waited, it took about 10 minutes for someone to ask us if we needed anything and then 10 more minutes for our drinks to come out, and then 15 more minutes for out waiter to ask us if we wanted anything else. Meanwhile our bay was ready but our food was not so we were told we had 15 minutes to go back for a bay... This place is cool but needs some work on customer service for sure. I've been here twice now and the waiters have been the same both times, they just disappear and go off and talk to other waiters instead of asking if you would anything else."}
{"text":"We had recently been to top golf in Tampa and had a blast. Service and accommodations were comfy there, with soft couches and large scoreboards. When we tried the Charlotte location we were disappointed. Loud music was playing which meant it was difficult to talk. Instead of relaxing couches there were high top tables and chairs. And the scoring screens were small, overshadowed by tv channels playing above. Still a fun time but a bit more cheesy and \"in your face\" kind of atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is an awesome concept. Got in right away and had great service. Wish there were more of these places around. Would definitely recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! We came with a large group (18 and all couples) and worked a deal to have 2 side by side bays and two cabanas by the pool for 2 hours. Our server was Raquel and she was on top of her game with such a large group. We always had food and drinks in our hands. The guys and gals had fun hitting balls but my favorite part was the pool! So much fun to watch our friends play golf while relaxing in the pool, we stayed an extra hour bc we had so much fun. There was a gigantic tv so I cook also watch the olympics. AND the building overlooks Wet Republic so we got to creep on Calvin Harris as well. Win win!   Totally a well spent afternoon and I would do it again on our next trip."}
{"text":"Topgolf is super unaccommodating. I'm trying to reserve bays for a graduation get together and I have gotten different responses from each person I have talked to. If you have a group larger than 8 it's not worth your time to try and work with them on reservations."}
{"text":"Came here last Saturday with a group of 8 people. Always wanted to come here since it opened and finally got to check it out with my girlfriend and her cousins that were visiting for the weekend. 

I knew it was a nice place but it was more than I expected. I wouldn't say that it's just a fancy driving range. But it's more of a all out entertainment center. With bars, tvs, and even a pool inside. 

We arrived around 10 PM on Saturday night, there was plenty of parking, we were headed up the stairs to the entrance and a guy told us it was a 2 almost 3 hour wait. We were a little shocked at first, it was a Saturday night and we expected it to be busy but not that busy. We decided to stay and wait anyways. 

While we were waiting we hung out and played some corn ball and had some drinks. My sister in law had some wings and fries which looked good. They have a full food menu and from the looks of it, it looks good although I didn't order anything. The drinks were good and about your average price for a drink in Vegas. Aka expensive and not strong enough. We only ended up waiting for about 40 minutes before they texted us that our bay was ready. Not a long wait at all and we were already enjoying ourselves so that's a plus. 

Now the real part of the review, the golfing experience. It was everyone's first time here so the manager or the supervisor or who ever he was talked to us about how to play and work the score monitor and what not. I'm a lefty so they had to bring out my own set of left handed clubs. The orthodox clubs are already placed there in the bay. 
Everyone took turns swinging and had a good time. I've played at driving ranges before and I like how at this range it's very easy to see the flight of your ball. The real only con I have is the technical problems. At least 3 or 4 times our screen/scoreboard froze or glitched out. And we had to call someone to come over to reset it. They ended up giving us a extra 20 minutes for the technical difficulties. 

The total was a little over 200. Split 8 ways. It's decently priced for the experience and will be looking forward to our next night out here."}
{"text":"Held an event here for 70 clients and vendors, everything was done RIGHT! I showed up 30 minutes early, could of been 5 minutes early as everything was setup as described. Food was great, did a small breakfast for all basic pastries and fruit then did a fajita lunch that had a bunch of us going back for seconds I think there was even some third trips for some. Everyone had a great time golfers and non golfers alike. Thanks to all the team for helping us produce a great event on short notice, Heather, Bri and your crew did an outstanding job, so all that's really left is another Thank You! Lastly Chef Jake great food thanks for producing not your average golf outing fair type of food. TopGolf exceeded our expectations!"}
{"text":"My only real problem with this establishment thus far is they over serve ppl. I have seen several men and ladies stumble out, one ending up with a broken nose!! Inexperienced bartenders not only need retraining on proper pours but a refresher course in basic cocktails. 

I love that they have Valet as it is too hot to spend forever searching for a parking space, with membership it is complimentary, just dont forget to tip! This one guy, John, he runs so fast to get my car I cant help but enjoy the view!! 

Tasty food, a bit on the slow side but those kinks will work themself out in no time."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time coming here. You are required to sign up for a card and pay for it. The line takes at least an hour and that's only the first step. Save your money and time and go to a regular driving range"}
{"text":"Brought a group of 8 people to top golf tonight for the \"zombie ball.\" Showed up at 10:30 dressed to the tee. We were cut off before we got to the bar because someone said \"I'm stone sober right now.\" The only thing worse than the price of golf balls is the management of this establishment. I've never felt more disrespected. I will never be back and will discourage all of my friends from going."}
{"text":"Had a blast here! First time here. Love the atmosphere. Staff was nice and friendly and the people playing are fun as well...."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a Saturday morning and only had to wait a minute or two for a bay to open up. It's pretty reasonable if you go with friends and split the cost ($25 for two hours of entertainment - that's what you'd pay to go to the movies as a couple).

The food is a total rip-off though. We ordered nachos and there were literally 8 chips on the plate. EIGHT! \"Wait, who hasn't eaten their second nacho yet?\" is a thing I actually said."}
{"text":"If I could do less stars I would, horrible service, shitty atmosphere and they don't have their crap together. After being told a 45 minute wait, 2 hours pass and they say we are next ok no biggie, then another 30 minutes go by and we are now 3rd in line. This place is a joke and I recommend spending your money any where but here!!! Bad customer service and a blight on Vegas! They don't care about locals or repeats just drunk partiers!"}
{"text":"Been to the Scottsdale Topgolf twice - once with the guys, once with a big group of family in town over Thanksgiving holiday - and had a total blast each time! What a brilliant concept - turning a driving range into a full entertainment, food and drinks venue.

It's a little pricey, but not terribly. First time I went was on a Thursday night and the place was totally packed. There are 3 levels of bays and the top (3rd) always seems to be occupied by a large corporate group - which this place is ideal for. We waited awhile, had some drinks & food, then got a bay on level 2 (the higher up you are, the better).

Golfers or non-golfers will both have fun as they've created scoring games with multiple targets, and many levels of them. Bring your own clubs or use the house clubs, it's your preference. Even if you've never picked up a club, you'll have a ton of fun at this place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing  I've played at other top golfs before and this one is the best ,service is great and place is nice and clean  ,the host Teegan was amazing"}
{"text":"NOT A PLACE FOR KIDS! It seems the success has gotten to the folks at Top Golf. It started with a bad attitude at the sign in.  No friendly comments...just give me your name and wait.  Then they forced my 9 year old to put his driver and hybrid club back in the car...Sorry folks but he is 9 and can't hit the ball over your fence.  With only 2 other clubs in his bag we were unable to play.  Seriously, a 9 year old needs to avoid hitting his driver just in case he launches one over the fence.  This is common sense calling...is anyone home at Top Golf."}
{"text":"Was all good until server told us how we \"unfortunately had to chuck all excess balls off bay.\" I guess $45 doesn't justify a little tweak to the system in which balls are dispensed."}
{"text":"Make sure you do not book your golf time online unless you want to pay an extra $25-$50 just for the reservation. This does not include your golf time.  Also be ready to pay an additional $5 per person to get a required registration card.  Read the fine print!  The management would not refund even though we explained we did not make a reservation."}
{"text":"Hopefully I experienced opening jitters..!!
The staff is ill prepared and ill trained to handle the volume of patrons they currently have. Customer service is not good at this time. 
30 minute wait on Thursday afternoon. Got to golf bay and computer didn't work. Took 15-20 minutes for the \"guest services\" person to be found and show up. 10 minutes later he was frustrated but got it going and comped us an extra hour. 40 minutes in, the entire establishment blacked out and our computer locked up again. Don't forget your waiter is just that..a waiter..they are not educated in the ways of anything but bringing food. But she did try and find the \"guest services\" person who eventually showed up after my brother raised cane..!!  After he showed up..it took this guy 10-15 minutes to reset the computer then he realized the bay had been rented for a corporate outing and made us move..!!! but he also comped us another hour and an appetizer for the problems. So we moved. Card still has 2 hours of play time on it but we decided to leave after playing only 1 hour. Leaving 1 hour of play time on the card. No where on the computer is there a place to click to save unused time..!!!  Again, waiter has now idea how to save time or even if you can. Waited for \"guest services \" 5-10 minutes, we went to the main counter and was told YOU CAN NOT SAVE UNUSED TIME. WE WERE TOLD YOU MUST HAVE A \"GUEST SERVICE\" PERSON COME TO YOU BOOTH AND DO THIS FOR YOU. 
A very aggravating afternoon."}
{"text":"Topgolf allows people to make reservations. I suggest you make one online otherwise you will be waiting for an hour. I had a party of 5 with a 4pm reservation and we only waiting 5 mins at the bar. Every single staff member that we encountered was extremely friendly and took very good care of us. We were escorted up to our bay. We were served by our waitress Lauren. We played for a full hour while enjoying food and drinks. The prices are fairly reasonable. Top golf is perfect for a family outing or even a fun date. The environment is very lively and has music playing in the background. You can dress comfortable as the attire is casual.  I highly recommend top golf to anyone that wants to have a good time and try something new. By the way, you do not have to be a pro golfer to have fun."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to go for any occasion if you're looking for food, drinks, and games (well of course, golf, but also shuffleboard, foosball, and a few TV games). 

We arrived on a busy Saturday afternoon and waited about an hour or so for our reservation. We grabbed drinks and food at the bar and also played a few games of shuffleboard and foosball! Definitely helped pass the time. I would highly recommend making a reservation.

Once at the driving range, anyone can join in on the fun - I have never done any sort of golfing besides mini golf and had a fantastic time. You can play a continuous game with your friends until the time runs out. Each hour cost is based on when you are there (cheaper for earlier, more expensive later). Seats were comfy wherever we were, lots of things to do, and heaters at every station in case it was cold like the time we came. The whole place is three stories! Hopefully you get a station more in the center because shooting into the targets would be much easier.

All of the servers were great from the bar to our table at our station. Fried pickles, fries, and s'mores were perfect to go with our drinks. The only thing I did not like was the jalapeno strawberry margarita - such a weird mix of flavors and had the consistency of syrup (ew..). All the other drinks were delicious though.

WOULD RECOMMEND! I just wish there was a Top Golf in Southern California."}
{"text":"Great idea for a date night! My husband and I just recently moved back to Az and this was a great addition to the area.The only thing is they should get some kind of screen protector because the bugs can crawl around on it and change the scores! Whoopsies, but what are they to do about nature?"}
{"text":"This is the second year that our daughters have participated in the the Kidzone Summer Academy. It is the only summer program that they have participated in and truly enjoyed. The director Daniel Sullivan is on point with staying in communication during and through out the year. The kids are provided lunch that is tasty. Overall all the teachers are friendly to the student golfers. We will definitely participate in the Kid Zone program through this next year."}
{"text":"105 degrees outside and top golf won't let you bring in a sealed bottle of water. Falls back on policy and health code violation.  Horrible service Top Golf, we won't be back all over a 35 cents bottle of water."}
{"text":"Hey everyone just have to say as a 4 handicap golfer the place is a joke, very nice people that don't know a thing about golf. Would have rather played a video game..the interactive scoreboard or rather uninteractive leaves alot to be desired as one of the things that I really wanted to do while I was here in Vegas I was thoroughly DISAPPOINTED. find something else to do"}
{"text":"Came down to topgolf on a Sunday night with the mrs and my friend and his mrs. The view is incredible...we sat at one of the bars while we waited for our tee box to be ready...the entire atmosphere is chill...the staff was amazing...we booked an hour but it ended going by really fast so we extended it for another 30 min. We ordered some appetizers, solo drinks, and a big tank of beer....total with tip for the 4 of us came out to $280...definitely not cheap but the experience was cool..."}
{"text":"Kelton G was an awesome server! A true hole in one! We had a great time and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Once you can get past the front check in people top golf is a 5 star place. The service at check-in, over the phone, and at reservations are what kill this place. I tried to reserve a bay for a bachelor party and for over a week no-one answered the phone or returned messages. When I went in to make the reservation in person, the fees were crazy. Reservations were limited to level 3 & 4, a bay fee of $105 per hour (that is the peak hour fee & is $10 more than the posted walk-in rates) with a $250-350 F&B minimum depending on who you talk to. On top of that, they charge an extra 7% service charge on your bill for using a reserved bay! That's crazy!

Obviously decided to forgo the reservation and just had one of the people in our group volunteer to come earlier to put our name down for a bay. Ended up getting our bay after waiting a little over an hour. The servers at the Birdie Bar were fantastic in taking our orders and transferring them to our bay once we got one. Once we got to our bay, the staff was just as great. The food was better than we expected and like I said earlier, the experience once we got past the front was 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is great!  It would get that last star if they did not limit us to irons...  Someone made a big boo boo when they opened this place and did not design the range to support long woods or hybrids... Other than that the place is a lot of fun."}
{"text":"We had heard a lot about how fun Top Golf is. Having never swung a golf club in my life (other than in a couple of mini golf outings), I was skeptical about how much fun it could possibly be for a non-golf enthusiast. We decided to give it a shot for my hubby's (also a non-golfer) birthday and we had a great time. We paid $5 for the lifetime membership card and put our name in to rent out a bay for five of us. At $45 per hour, it was a great deal. We waited in the bar area for a little over an hour (we arrived at about 9:45pm) before we got the text that our bay was ready.

Gameplay was fun, even though four-fifths of our group were novices. We signed up for an hour of play and extended for another 30 minutes as the original window neared its close. The servers were friendly and attentive; we never had to worry about running out of drinks as they returned to check on us often. Highly recommended as an out-of-the-ordinary night of fun."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, good food and drinks, fun place to go enjoy hitting white balls with friends."}
{"text":"This place was fun and all but the service sucks took 2 hours for our food to come and by the time our food came it was already time to go, top golf in Houston was much more better even though there were more people the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"So I specifically made a yelp account to leave this review, because I saw it when I was exiting your building and I wanted to share my experience!

But anyway, I've been to Topgolf Scottsdale roughly a handful of times. Always a great experience, everyone is typically very friendly and polite, food is good, golf is fun. However, I wanted to write about my specific experience the last time I was here. I came in a couple Fridays ago and I brought my family. I had a very large family, with several little kids under the age of 12. Everyone was very well accommodating and they helped us with everything, even so much as helping to carry our clubs. 

We got sent down to the first floor, which was totally ok, with younger kids it helped put my mind at ease slightly, knowing I wouldn't have to stress about them getting close to the yellow line. 

We were sent all the way down, I believe bay 101 or 102, so a little ways down there, but we remained in good spirits!

My husband arrived first and had already had the bay reserved for us, he goes to Topgolf quite frequently. 

Almost immediately we were greeted by our server, which is why I am writing this review. She was spectacular, funny, friendly and went above and beyond anything we could have ever hoped. We all felt the need to give her a hug when we left because she treated us as if we were her own family. 

Her name was Torie and we loved her, she was from somewhere around Pittsburgh, in case you have more than one Torie working there! She taught us so much about Topgolf and where the company was going, which was so cool to learn about! She delivered excellent service, giving us recommendations and tips on fun games to play, but she didn't just stop there! She completely surpassed any service we had received before.

Like I mentioned before we had several kids, very young, with us. She was wonderful with them! She made them chocolate milks, brought them cups with lids, and cleaned up every spill we made, and there were plenty of them! All through this, she remained with a smile on her face. She even went so far as giving my youngest golf lessons and tips because he was getting frustrated every time he got up to golf. She worked with him until he was hitting golf balls better than me! Where most people would get frustrated with a group like ours, she didn't show it at all. 

She made our experience unforgettable. We kept her running back and forth because we were eating, drinking and hanging out with friends from out of town. It wasn't until we got up to leave, before we noticed how much walking back and forth she must have done for us, and she never let it show. Once we got up and realized she must have walked so much taking care of us, my husband tried to hand her additional cash for our gratitude, which she refused, insisting we had already left plenty. We hid it under the ketchup bottle anyway! She was amazing and cared so much about our experience, which warmed my heart. The bay next to us also couldn't stop raving about how great she was!

It is clear she loves the company, and what she does. You have a real gem there, Topgolf. Hold onto her as long as you can because she made our experience unforgettable. 

Please pass this along to her! 

Sorry for the novel, but I wanted to share and let everyone know that Topgolf is a wonderful place! It is so much fun no matter your age, please give it a visit!"}
{"text":"Really fun place that has a bit of something for everyone. When we first arrived we were told for level 1 or 2 it'd be 1.5-2 hour wait. I thought we would just be sitting around waiting and bored but they have a huge rec room with games, drinks/bars, TVs and sports. We didn't even have to wait an hour before we were called up for level 1 golf. During that time we drank and played shuffle board... not too bad. Definitely regret not paying the extra ten bucks / waiting the extra time for level 2 or 3. Still had a great time golfing and I'm not even a big golfer!"}
{"text":"We came to Charlotte for a quick weekend trip and had to give this place a try. Came on a Sunday evening. So impressed!!! Had a great waitress, so relaxing and enjoyable! We paid for an hour but we didn't want to stop so we stayed for another hour. We had a great experience!!!"}
{"text":"I had a great time there. The golfing was fun and challenging.  The food was excellent and I couldn't of asked for better service than I got from Mac on the first floor."}
{"text":"My husband and I had been here once before and enjoyed it the first time and thought to start coming here weekly to relax and get out to the strip since we are locals and usually avoid the area.

Our most recent visit here was absolutely unacceptable. It was a Friday night and we had a bay on level 3 which was $90 an hour. We had 4 people total and 3/4 had memberships (in order to golf you must have a membership, if you do not have one, it is $5). We stayed for about an hour and a half and had drinks and food. When our bill came, we were charged for 4 memberships even though we only signed 1 person up for a membership. Upon noticing this and asking for this to be corrected, they stated that they had already run our card and that the only way to refund us would be to void the charge and charge it again for the correct amount. HELLO, this would be a total hold of $500 for the weekend. We were not offered an apology but attitude from the so called \"hospitality\" manager Tammy. I have not encountered such a poor excuse of a manager in recent memory. She was curt and extremely rude, interrupting my husband as he was trying to explain the issue. We were given a BS excuse as to why they charged us unnecessarily and \"accidentally\". It is my belief that they purposely charge customers for this \"membership\" hoping you will be too drunk or unaware to notice. At the end of the day it was a stupid $15 on a bill of over $250 for us, but it was about the principle and doing the right thing. Beware if you are going to look for extra charges to your bill!"}
{"text":"This place is bull, I have a friend the just had a party for her husbands 40th, top golf just screwed her. The management is not very cooperative. They have the worst customer service, took all the food and drink chips 1/2 hour before the party ended. Our party of over 20 people will never have a party here. Will go somewhere else."}
{"text":"PLEASE GET IT TOGETHER.  Bad experience from beginning to end. Tried to have dinner sat at a dirty table then they totally skipped a dinner. No waitress at the bag, then had to wait 30 minutes because the machine ran out of balls."}
{"text":"Never been to a topgolf before and was so impressed by our server Ellie. She was so fun and helpful and always attentive to all of our needs. Will always ask for her to work our future outings!"}
{"text":"If you want to test the athleticism of your family members, this is the place. Shooting golf balls at targets to get points with 20 balls a game. We got an hour for $40 with our veteran discount. Very cool environment, I have attached videos of my family golfing. Cool vibes and if you don't get competitive in this, you're not doing it right. 

Unfortunately, they have rules that you can't do any happy Gilmore swings (a running start) and you aren't allowed to aim for the cart picking up the golf balls. So my personal goals weren't achieved. But I went to top golf yesterday and I'm going back today! So so fun!"}
{"text":"Great place to go and have fun.  Long wait to get in, but the wait is because it's very popular.  Food is good, but not great.  However, it's definitely a great place to go have fun."}
{"text":"Super fun golf-ish spot with drinks and decent food!!

Date day for the hubs and I so we stop here for an hour to hit some golf balls.  You can choose different games & you pay for an hourly game play.

The cazadores margarita was decent though I did ask for no salt... Which it did arrive with salt.  We shared the chicken nachos and 2 buffalo chicken sliders.  The food was very decent but next time I said let's order when were almost finished.  

Nice friendly staff here willing to go out of their way to make a customer happy."}
{"text":"With the amount of payroll being spent in the place you would expect to be wowed.  Your not.  

Lack of training and supervision have people standing around, not in the right place or having no idea of what to do.  When our bay was ready we stood for over 10 minutes waiting for a runner (there were four talking to each other right behind me but the desk never called them over.  They misspelled most of our names, the system decided one of our last names was inappropriate and could not be entered.   Three different  people tried but to no avail.   We identified we left handed clubs when checking in  and they forgot them.  The ball dispenser stopped dispensing balls, 20 minutes to get it fixed.  We had three servers who took over from the previous and had no idea of the issues we had experienced.  When we asked for more time to be added do to the delays we got attitude.  The server added 15 minutes but had an attitude. 

Overall, this could be a fun place if they figure it out."}
{"text":"Pretty Upscale..Of course it's Vegas...Overall it was worth the $$$.  After all, time with family is priceless....I definitely recommend.."}
{"text":"It is 8/1/2017 4:45pm. My husband and I have been here for an hour.  Nice place. Lots of people here for a Tuesday. Great concept. 
We were up on the third floor  and we
were the only people at the bar, and the bartender completely ignored us. He seemed to be fixated with the girls in the pool, which is understandable, but at least acknowledge the people at your bar. We finally left. The bartender on the second floor the Birdie Bar was great and happy to serve us. 
Would have given 5 stars if we hadn't been completely ignored."}
{"text":"I have always had positive experiences every time I have been to Top Golf! The atmosphere is always fun! The service may be a little bit slower but they have always been friendly and do a great job! Likewise it is always busy every time I go so that is probably why service is slightly slower - I don't blame them at all. 

The food menu is pretty limited, but it is decent. The cheese fries are to die for. Avoid the calamari...it's not the best I've had. I have also had the chips and guac and it's decent, just what you would expect from chips and guac. The salad with goat cheese and pecans is decent too, but would be great if there wasn't so much cinnamon on the pecans. Anyway, just get some cheese fries to help soak up the booze and you will be good!

As for the bar, they have Tito's so I'm a happy camper. They have never gotten my order wrong either so that's wonderful!

In regards to golfing - this place is awesome! I love how they have the TVs set up to show you which area your ball went into (when it goes into a colored area). It is easy to work and anyone can play, not just those who golf regularly. The staff who tends to the golfers are pretty cool and do an amazing job.

All in all, Top Golf is a great place to spend a Friday or Saturday night at, and if you haven't been, I would definitely recommend you give it a try! Even if you are not a golfer =)"}
{"text":"This place is crazy fun! Good place to catch up with friends and have a laugh. 
Pricey, but there are staff everywhere waiting on you. (White wine Sangria is delicious)"}
{"text":"The second annual birthday trip to Top Golf for my dad will be the last. After ordering food and drinks, it took nearly the full paid hour to receive our food, after reminding the wait staff we had ordered. They managed to squeeze out another half hour, which I am sure is by design. 

Once the food finally arrived we played some more golf and decided to make the most of our time getting additional balls to hit after the time expired. While the wait staff was nearly non existent during our playing time they happened to be cleaning the bay next to us and decided to push all the remaining balls over the edge, because of an arbitrary rule of not having more than one ball out at a time. 

Felt sorry for the people below and thought that could be more dangers than having a few extra balls on our faux grass. We looked at the posted rules and could find nothing about such a violation. 

We decided next time we would just go to a regular driving range with a few flasks and will find another way to spend the $200 we will save by not going back to Top Golf."}
{"text":"Love the staff and the food was great... did I tell you about the golf? Misters misting u in the hot sun.. tv, beer and golf! What a fun place!"}
{"text":"Great concept great food and drinks!  This is a must visit while in Vegas!  Guys bring the girls! There's a pool too!"}
{"text":"This place is a blast was here for my boyfriends birthday with a very big crew the view was amazing the atmosphere was amazing!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We absolutely had a great time.  The place was busy but we got a bay within 5 minutes.  The girls were very helpful and our waitress was outstanding with the service.  

Great view from the second level.  Fun selection of games you can play for every level.  We will absolutely return."}
{"text":"A little rich! Our family went to Topgolf for lunch and to hit some balls and basically check it out. First off not impressed with fact there is a $10 reservation fee for us to come and spend money at their establishment, really not impressed when we needed to change the Rez by an hour and got charged again! Then the $5 lifetime membership, which when using again you must have the physical card present. The food was actually very good, but again not cheap. The driving range aspect was very cool and certainly an experience and even with me complaining, I will likely return, hopefully I don't lose my card! Lol."}
{"text":"Great idea for a driving range!  However,  we chose to go on a Friday night. It was a madhouse. I don't recommend doing this. They assured us of a 1 hr wait. So, we waited and after that hour we were still 19th in line for a bay and we're told it would be another hour and 30 min. 

If you want to practice your swing don't go to Top Golf. If you want to drink and fry a Friday night waiting and drinking with the possibility of hitting a few balls, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"So before I write this review, I should state that I suck at golf. Scratch that, I am basically N/A at golf because, besides the lovely game of putt putt, I have never even swung a golf club. Fast forward to end of review..... I had so much fun at Topgolf!

My husband and I came over his lunch break one Monday that I had off of work. The setup was super impressive and the inside is very nice looking. His company is a Platinum card holder so we got the royal treatment (ie. didnt have to wait in any lines and got fancy golf clubs). At first, I was barely getting the ball off the tee. However, at the end, I was hitting the targets like crazy! We played for a bout an hour and a half. Since the Platinum card comes with Topgolf games for free, it was nice not to have to worry about timing of how long we were playing. 

The waitresses stopped by regularly and we ordered pulled pork sliders and chips/salsa/guac. The sliders were delicious and the guac was nicely made. 

Overall, I am a huge Topgolf fan after this experience. It was a fantastic way to spend my Monday afternoon and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of the coolest spots around and I don't golf at all. Awesome place, technology makes this place amazing, amazing server(Bali)  who gave me a vet discount and pushed me to the front of the line, delicious food and the MAN-mosa was great. I'll be back many times in the future"}
{"text":"Went here for a corporate social event during a convention so everything was complimentary.

Tried the sliders, bruschetta, tuna tartare and lobster rolls. Everything tasted great and the sliders even had a dash of spicy ketchup in them. Service was great, from the waiters walking around with hors d'oeuvres to the bartenders serving us great pours of Oban.

Didn't play golf but those who were looked like they were having fun. It was fun just to watch and we had a great time!"}
{"text":"Fun place!  Food and drinks are great and reasonably priced.  I'll be going often once the weather gets a tad cooler"}
{"text":"The golf range is really cool however the worst part about the place is the food. I had food poisoning from it. My family members had the same issues with top golfs food. I asked what everyone ate that made them sick and they all said they had appetizers chicken in it!!!! Stay away from the chicken. I'm giving this place 2 stars only because the range is cool but over priced!"}
{"text":"I have been here quite a while. Had the best experience all these time untill the last two.. i have always came here during  the day which i may say it was awesome  the staff kept up with everything(food, drinks, refill) always checking  in on us. Each time  we always  hit the  bar after words. Till i went during  the evening place was pack and had a group  of 9. -.- lets start  by saying the server  didn't  show up to often. We all order food at once  so we wouldn't confuse  him. He had a smile  on his face but knew something  was wrong. Only 3 plates  showed  up when good came and when wr ask him where the rest was he replied  by saying he forgot. An average  drink took about 15 min.  And we had to hunt our server down for our  tab. At the end we still think its a awesome  place but will not go at night, it sucks.!"}
{"text":"In one word: Fantastic. 

This is a destination golf facility that doesn't disappoint. I was recently in Scottsdale with my girlfriend who was initially nervous about the golfing experience. When we arrived, we checked in, went to get a beer and were immediately moved into our bay. I can't say enough about the atmosphere - service is great, people are laid back and everyone is having a good time. There are plenty of ways to score points, and plenty of games for people to play, so everyone ends up having a great time!

On top of that, the food is amazing. We had both the Mango Habanero wings and Buffalo Chix flatbread - both were excellent. Tables around us were also happy with their food.

Note: GET THERE EARLY. Friday/Saturday nights, the wait can be as long as three hours. We went Sunday afternoon, and there was no wait."}
{"text":"I had a great time celebrating my boyfriends 23rd birthday, the food was great and our server Camila was awesome, thank you so much! I recommend the nachos, delicious!"}
{"text":"The most fun I have ever had on a business outing! They have nothing like this back home in Virginia, too bad, because I would be here every day.

This place will put bowling alleys out of business. It's all I could think of when I was there. I don't golf, but this place was awesome! The food was good to. We were here for a catered event and had some awesome chicken, asparagus, rolls, mashed potatoes... it was great!

I played for free and ate for free so I can't comment on the price, I saw that it was somewhere like ~25.00 an hour. Seemed reasonable, I would pay it if there was one near my house."}
{"text":"I Love this place! Only gave 4 stars bc the menu has gotten stale on me bc I enjoy going here so often. You can't beat golf, a sports game, a cold beer, and food with some friends. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I would have rated them much higher but thought some of their practices weren't cool and kind of put a damper on the experience.
First, it's a cool concept and we had fun.  Had two children that had never golfed before and two adults.  There were no children's clubs available so we sat and waited, they said they'd bring them to us as soon as they were available....but we were paying by the hour (whoops forgot that) and after waiting quite awhile just had them play with adult clubs.  Kid clubs never came.
Didn't like the time spent having them input everyone's personal information, phone number email addresses and birthdays for even the kids.  I wasn't willing to give my kids emails and the attendant seems to push for it again and gave up.  You have to pay $5 for each person for a membership even for children...thought that was kind of a money grab. 
Gamification of a driving range makes for a fun activity so I really enjoyed that and the ambiance was hip.  
Portion sizes on their snack food was less than desirable, $6 fries in a tiny silver sleeve can hardly be called snackable food.  Homemade chips were small portioned as well.  
Biggest compliant I had was that we checked in around 11:15 am and there was a 45 minute wait which was fine because we didn't have reservations...I get that.  BUT we didn't start golfing until after noon and after noon they change the pricing tier up by $15.  I didn't think it was fair to do that based on when \"they\" could get to us...it should be based on when you arrive...like bars do at happy hour.  Especially when you are increasing a fairly decent percentage.  
Additionally it should just let you play and bill you based on how much time you are playing or pay for a certain amount of \"games\" like bowling...really sucked to be playing only our second game and it shut off before the last child could shoot her last few balls.  Maybe a meter or a warning or something...instead we'd all been having a good time but left with a crying child.  Just felt unfinished, unresolved, to not get to tally up scores and allow everyone to play to completion especially after waiting so long for kids clubs.  Could you imagine going bowling and playing 8 frames and it just shuts off?  You'd feel cheated, like \"we'll shoot maybe I could still have won\" Eh...there are a lot of options in Vegas probably won't go back"}
{"text":"I was here for the second time last weekend. This place is great. The food is delicious and the service is friendly and attentive. The bar area is great while your waiting as well. Even if you're not an avid golfer, this is still a fun thing to do. The setup is ideal for bonding with your friends. And friendly competition is healthy!! It's best to go with 4+ people. This is because they charge hourly regardless of the number of people playing. I intend to go here anytime I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Top Golf is our go to place to take friends, family or host work events! We have always had such a great experience each time we are there. 
Yesterday we had the privilege of having Chandler serve us and this is our second time having him. He is fun, very attentive and overall a great host!"}
{"text":"Top golf.  This is a very nice venue, however prices are much higher than other top golf locations.  Also their \"Climate control\" is hot air blowing on you.  It was hot!  Granted it's 105 out but the climate control did absolutely nothing."}
{"text":"Really fun!  Long line to get in, but once we paid, we were very quickly taken to a bay. 

Our server was excellent, as was every employee was encountered. We only ordered an appetizer, and it was delivered right away and was good. 

For us, it was pricy fun because it was just us - so no one to help split the hourly bay charges. And since we only had an hour to fit in the golf and snacking, it wasn't necessarily relaxing. However, if you go with another couple or with a few friends, you could easily spend a few hours and have time to play and eat and split the cost and it wouldn't be that expensive."}
{"text":"Fun activity but I will not be returning. Horrible service. First the bartender did not even greet us as we sat at the bar to wait for our bay, he seemed unenthused to say the least. The entire time he was chewing on a straw. Unprofessional. We ordered food and before it came out our bay was ready. One employee told us we can transfer our tab no problem and they can bring the food out to the bay, but the bartender forced us to wait and close out our tab while our food was outside sitting at our table. This was frustrating since we planned on ordering more drinks later. Then they gave us a bay that was on the 1st floor when we requested 2nd or 3rd but since our food was already there we just stayed. They were out of multiple food items and hefeweizen beer that we ordered one then had to switch. Also, the holes were not counting our points so we had to manually put them in every time. When you pay $45/hr that is just wasting your paid time. It seemed like a joke to be honest when you spend $70+ for one hour of activity. Not worth it!"}
{"text":"As an avid golfer, I SO looked forward to the grand opening of the Scottsdale location. However, after two visits with the same issues, I felt I needed to leave a review to hopefully save others some trouble. (Always plan on at least a 1-hour wait.)

First problem: They seems to be grossly understaffed with their phone lines. I was trying to get a rough estimate on wait times the day-of, but could not get through to anyone on the phone. No sure how I'm supposed to plan my outing with friends if no one is available to answer the phones?

I then got fed up with waiting on the phones for more than 15-minutes, so decided to stop in because I was passing them anyways. They told me about an hour-long wait for a bay. I then put my name down, and texted my friends to come on over. An hour goes by, and my bay still hasn't opened. We ended up waiting another HOUR for our bay...absolutely ridiculous. 

The staff at the concierge service seemed to be high schoolers without ANY training in basic customer service. Even went as far to say \"yeah, you're not the only one to complain.\" I asked for a manager, and no one could be found. The food, drinks and games were great, as usual. However, the obvious lack of customer services training, under staffing of phone lines, and grossly inaccurate wait times left me with a bad taste in my mouth. 

To the managers at Top Golf, PLEASE train your staff on customer service etiquette, and figure out a way to accurately give out wait times. Answering your phones wouldn't hurt, either."}
{"text":"Great team building event. Good food and very nice local beer selection. Being from the Midwest, any outdoor activity in January with warm weather is a big plus!"}
{"text":"Awesome first time experience!  The golf is super fun and the drinks and food are delicious. Try the nachos - you won't be disappointed!  Service is great and we had no problem being a walk in with no reservation. We will be back and have already recommended you to others."}
{"text":"We usually have such a good time when we go but it seems like many of the familiar faces I've seen are all gone. The wait time wasn't bad at all but the service wasn't good. We went to golf, eat, and drink and the food was great but we had to ask for everything as our server kept forgetting. Brought food with no plates. We ask for napkins thinking he'd bring silverware and brings just napkins. Then we wanted to change the channel because our bay had a broken tv and it took 30 min for someone to change it. By then, our time was up. After spending X amount of dollars in 60 min on play, food, drinks we get told we can't sit there anymore because there's a wait to get in. Two things wrong here, first off we just spent a ton and for a kid server to tell us we can't stay and sit there but we can eat inside is wrong. Second off, there was absolutely no wait. It was probably the most dead I've seen it ever. Just a poor experience last night. But hey, everyone has a bad night sometimes."}
{"text":"Tonight was one of the best times my friends and I have ever been to Topgolf. Usually the servers are nice but tonight, our server Chandler was outstanding. He was so welcoming and funny and made our time very special at TopGolf! Thank you so much Chandler, and thank you TopGolf for hiring him, he is the best!"}
{"text":"Topgolf is really what bowling wants to be - fun without having to rent tacky shoes.  

Even though it was incredibly fun, the reason I give it 5 stars though is the obvious effort to offer great service.  

We went on a Friday and had no problem getting a bay. We were met outside by some nice Topgolf employees.  Once inside, employees quickly checked us in and escorted our group to our bay.  For an hour it averages about $11 person.  Food and drink prices I thought were reasonable.    

I also want to give huge kudos to our server - she checked back frequently and was super friendly.

Recommendations: 
Get your $5 membership online.  This will save you a little time inside.

Leave your sticks unless you're so tall or short that average size clubs won't do it for you. Our group of 4 did fine with the selection of clubs they had at the bay.      

'Sunday Funday' offers significant discounts.   

We'll be back - What a great place!"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE spot on the Las Vegas Strip !! After a wonderful dinner at MGM, and a long concert following at the Garden, my group wanted to stay on property. With the current properties all charging for parking it makes more sense to carpool, and plan all your nights events in one property.

We were able to attend a poppin new dinner spot, attend Ariana, win some money, change, and make it to Top Golf .

We had someone hold a bay, even though it wasn't a guarantee , even though we were getting out late from Ari, the mgmt were still kind to hold our bay!! 

Everyone treated us so warm and even though it was later , we never felt rushed. We order some food, after hitting a few balls, and the shrimp bites, burgers, and injectable donuts were ooey gooey and melted in my mouth 

The female manager checked on us through the night and you can really tell she takes pride in her job and employees. The whole staff have a whole , fresh team spirit that is all about having a great experience. They all seem so happy and it makes you feel part of it all . Unlike some night venues that make you feel like you are a nuisance . I would defiantly chose spending a night here , than a night club.

The game itself is so much fun! Even like a beginner like myself. I was the newest one to hitting there, and was second behind the Champion Daniel who is good at ALL sports. Toward the end, idk what came over, but maybe the over the knee high heel boots, or the plunging Bebe top, but I KILLED it and won, beating him!! I was beyond shocked and I can't wait to go back and try in more appropriate wear. Girls were playing too, and there is food, and shuffle board , pools, TVs. PLease check it out! TopGolf is the best spot in town!!"}
{"text":"Last week my self , my husband and 13 year old , went in to TG to eat (after hearing so much gossip).

  When we pulled up to  Vallet about 5:30 pm vallet was not working , we had to find parking and walk about 15 min. To find TG , which was frustrating because abour   2  hours later when we left , it was up and runnng.  (The directions and signs were kind of confusing as were the baracades )

Kind of sucked because I have asthma and try not to walk in the heat.


There really is not a restaurant, you just sit were ever . Try to find a menu and wait for someone to notice you .. ( I had to go to thr bar to ask for help).

Our waiteess/bartender BRIDGET was AMAZINGLY helpful , she  was VERY patient in helping out with me being a vegan. ( no dairy , no meat).

I ordered the flat bread pizza with peaches and candied pecans (no cheese) , it was quite tasty.

Hubby and child had a bacon cheese burger , it was cooked a little over done for M . more like MW and dry.


I think  this was a ONE time thing. Sorry guys , the whole experience was just ok for me. 

Again the highlight was how AWESOME Bridget was ."}
{"text":"It saddens me to write this review. I am truly a big fan of Top Golf. I've played in Houston and it was love at first site.  I would rate the Houston location 5 stars. This location is the exception. The biggest strike against it is that it plays short... meaning you must leave all your woods (metal) in the car. The only thing you can hit are your irons. For a driving range, this is sacrilege!!!  Their \"long drive\" game is no more than a 4 or 5 iron.  Someone seriously messed up when designing this location.  To add to the disappointment, the staff (including the manager) acted as if I should be grateful to pay the high rates for the pleasure of working only on my short game.  Therefore;  I say \"never again\".  If you can't take the big dog out of the bag, grip it, and rip it, then how can you call yourself a \"driving range\"?  This location would be better off calling itself \"Short Golf\".  I felt like the director in charge at the time was the \"Soup Nazi\". Her attitude was \"you will like it or you get no golf\". What a shame for this brand. 

So, if you don't really want to work on your golf game and all you want to do is eat, drink and hit some balls, you'll like this place once you get through the long lines and slow service. The \"Top Golf\" concept is amazing; however, the execution at this location is poor at best."}
{"text":"Do not come on a Friday night. We got here around 7pm. The place is so packed it took us 3 hrs for a bay. We decided to get food while we wait. The food area was packed with loud drunk people. The waiter forgot to put in three of our orders but it still took an hour to get the food he didn't forget. We had to wait an additional half hour for some chicken tenders and chicken and waffles. When we finally got our food they messed up both burger orders. The waiter was nice enough about it. Generally the workers are nice."}
{"text":"This place is a joke! When the waitress comes over and bets the bachelor that if he makes the shot she will pay for them and then doesn't and brings the manager over and the server says she didn't make that bet and the manager Denys it! Come on it's Vegas if you can't commit to keeping bets you make maybe you should be in Vegas! 
And than they bring security over like you are a threat after calling them out on it! We will never be back and I recommend you don't come there as well!"}
{"text":"Went there with a group total of 3 people on a Saturday night, we were told there was a two hour wait we decided to wait in one of the bars. We were surprised we got called after only one hour. Once you're playing time flies. It was fun, $50/hour."}
{"text":"What a fun place.  This new facility still has many kinks to work through however.  Machines not printing passes to cold French fries. But salads, sandwiches, and beverages were great."}
{"text":"I am stretched to even give this a single star but must say the good was excellent. No golf, though. We drove an hour to get to TopGolf - pumped and ready to go. Showed up at 5:30. Told it was a 2 hour wait. At 8:00 we were told we were #18 on the list and it would be another hour. All due to the fact that they had two special event parties that had basically bought out the place. Why in the world would they sell out the place on a Saturday night? Bad management decision. My recommendation - start taking reservations! I would have paid double to play even for an hour."}
{"text":"Impressive facility and atmosphere. Food was great.  Golf games not impressed as balls did not register at times in scoring.  No long clubs for people that are tall.   Not sure I would do this again as it is expensive and did not get value."}
{"text":"My experience at top golf was absolutely amazing! Jamee J. was a great time and so energetic, fun, and attentive. A manager (Robert) came by and made sure our experience was great. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"I don't play golf may never ever pick up a golf club! But I will tell you what, the atmosphere was great and OMG the grilled Sea Bass Sliders were the bomb!"}
{"text":"Fabulous concept, delicious food, terrible service and an absolute oven even at night. You would think that they would have invested in mist on all bases (balconies where you play from) but they didn't. Also the service at least from the agent that takes you to the bay was not good, we asked her if the time had started and she said it had but we where wasting our time \"asking too many questions...\". Coming from an industry of excellence in service this was the worst welcome I've had in Vegas. I would go back in October tho"}
{"text":"Best place to kick back drink some beer and watch whatever you feel like watching on a giant screen while playing golf"}
{"text":"Although we were a party of 8, and its was very cold, we were well looked after and totally enjoyed the experience..  the heaters work well, you can adjust them yourself, and the food was good, and the whole family from little kids to grandpa enjoyed this time.  Well worth the money for a family activity."}
{"text":"This was my first Top Golf experience & I loved it. Bars, games, & swimming pools. Can't imagine anyone not having fun! While waiting for a bay (1 hour wait on Friday afternoon) we sat at a table & ordered food. The service was a little slow but not terrible. Ordered Greek skewers, rock shrimp, pork sliders, & a burger. Everything was really good. Before we were finished with our food our bay was already ready. You can delay your time if needed or just check in & bring your food with. 

The woman that got us all set up to golf was very informative & took her time explaining everything. The service we received from the servers in the bay was also top notch. You pay for golfing at the end so if you're a local be sure to let them know before paying because locals get 20% off walk in pricing."}
{"text":"I arrive at Top Golf with 5 frienda, us all being 16. After being greeted by numerous attractive females. I get through the line after paying $12 for membership and the entry fee. Then I was told we cannot play because of only being 16 without an adult. I understand rules and policies and I respect it, but Tell me BEFORE I pay money to play. Will not be going back, I am Legally allowed to drive alone, I work and I pay taxes. But I cannot swing a golf club without an adult. Awesome. Thank Top Golf.


NOTICE. Top Golf did respond and took care of the problem."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Came here last Saturday afternoon with the boyfriend and we had a great time! 

Once we got settled in, we ordered drinks (I had the Strawberry Mule and the bf got a beer) and food (chicken with waffles and an order of the cheese beer dip with chips). 

The game was sooo much fun!!! I don't play golf and I had a blast. We played on the first level but next time we'll ask for the 2nd level.

We'll def be coming back this summer!!!
If your wondering what to wear, wear comfy, casual clothes and sneakers. Have fun!!"}

Thanks, Jesse!"}
{"text":"great fun and nick the gm greet us and gave us the information about this amazing place plus it was busy but so easy to navigate the lines .fast and fun ...i love it....."}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to attend a corporate event at Top Golf this weekend, which meant that my food and entertainment were paid for. And although I shelled out quite a bit for alcohol, I left feeling that I got my money's worth--and would have even if I had paid for the rest as well.

We were on the third floor, which is $75 per hour from noon to 5 p.m. (plus a $5 \"membership fee\" per person). Two hours for six of us would have been $180, or $30 per person, which I think is pretty reasonable (although free is better!), and there is locals pricing as well. We also got a bunch of free food, including a delicious fruit platter, chips and guacamole, and a barbecue buffet. I'm sure most people weren't there for the food, but I thought everything was great, especially the chunky guac and homemade chips.

Drinkwise, I had two Tanqueray martinis ($16 each, ugh!), and my husband had two beers ($7 each, another ugh!), with a 23 percent (!) service fee included, so two hours of food, fun, and entertainment was $60 total. (Not sure how much it would have cost for all that food, but I'll bet it would have been close to triple that if we had to pay for it all.)

I haven't played golf in a long time, and some of my co-workers have never even held a club, but we all had a blast aiming for the targets. There's nothing intimidating about it, so even if you are a novice, you should give it a try if you have any interest in the sport.
 
Overall, I had a great time at Top Golf, although the music was SUPER loud--even at 1 p.m. Guess I'm a little older than their typical guest, but it would have been nice to be able to talk to my co-workers without shouting. Can't beat that view, though, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who wants a little change of pace from the typical daypool or nightclub scene."}
{"text":"Sandra Jan is amazing,  represents the best of Top Golf.  Great food.  Good drinks.  Even if too cold for golf."}
{"text":"Updated this to make it 5 stars! I forgot to add that our server was super friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Venue is great and is definitely a wow factor when you get in because you don't see something like that often. Backdrop of the Strip is the best.

Three stars were given because after we were settled in and excited to play, we were re-seated twice. Not a great first impression for our company outing. The woman who sat us moved us because another party was coming in an hour (and we had paid for two hours.) I would assume that the hostess/front told her the length of time we would be there so we didn't have to play musical chairs. 

Not only that, but she rushed off without explaining to our group what we were to do next. We were confused about the memberships, she didn't explain the game nor equipment (as we were all there for the first time.) 

We requested another tee as one of our members were left handed and it didn't come until an hour later. 

However- the f&b service was good. We had a couple of requests here and there and they were on it. Food was good as well. 

I think they definitely have their kinks to figure out since it's a new property, but I didn't think it would be that apparent on a slow Wednesday afternoon. Would we come back? I would. It's a cool spot to take a group. I just imagine how crazy it must be on a weekend evening."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends. It's located right next to Talking Stick. Make sure you sign up for a member card online to save some money before you play. Currently the price for an hour of golf is $45 per bay (doesn't matter the # of players). The system is pretty easy to use for newbies."}
{"text":"This place was an amazing experience. Was here for an event and had a blast. Great atmosphere and great drinks. Can't choose length though."}
{"text":"Great place!! Our server was amazing and the other staff members were very helpful and attentive. On top of that food was amazing. Must try the shrimp! Not five stars due to the warmth in the facility. Recommend fans at this location in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is a blast! Great for parties, you don't even have to be very good at golf to have fun. It's clean, has great staff, and is easy to start and get going.  Price is decent, and it's Very accommodating for good golfers and beginners alike. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had a blast here! I'm not a golfer, but that didn't matter. I had a wonderful time with some great friends. I can't wait until they build the locations in New Orleans and Baton Rouge!"}
{"text":"Incredibly Disappointing On All Levels: We went to Top Golf for a celebration and were accompanied by my mother-in-law who uses a walker. After waiting over 30 minutes to get a bay, we were finally given a bay on the first level. We had to walk all the way to the end of the first floor corridor to get a table that allows disability access and seating. Once we got to the bay, we were asked to swipe our credit card immediately and told our time was running immediately. I asked if we could have five minutes to look over the menu before the time started tolling, the answer was no. Best of all, when we tried to begin golfing our bay was broken and would not dispense any balls. A technician was called and arrived after 15 minutes, we were told any time lost would be credited. After working for 20 minutes,the technician told us he could not fix it and would try to find us a replacement bay. Of course, none were available and we were told to wait to see if he could fix the bay. At this point, we had been there for an hour and half and not even hit a ball. Ultimately, we were told we could get another bay, but there would be no seating for the disabled and that we would have to walk to the opposite end of the corridor again. After waiting and walking back and forth through the complex we gave up and asked for a refund. We were told they had to get the manager, which took another 20 minutes. The manager eventually came, but was annoyed we wanted a refund and tried to get us to stay in the bay, which the technician said might not work since he did not know what was wrong with it. After an hour and half, walking my mother in law all over the place and no golf we left incredible disappointed and frustrated. Frankly, I could not believe that in this day and age top golf would be so unfriendly and lack compassion for parties who have people with disabilities. Even when attempting to use the elevator, the host had my mother-in-law squeeze herself with her walker next to a large rolling dumpster, forcing the rest of our party to use the stairs and meet her at the bottom. I'm also amazed that my recommendation that top golf put bays with lower seating that is accessible for those with disabilities closer to the entry and not at the end of the corridor seemed to be a profound revelation to the manager. Again, an incredibly disappointing experience that should give people with a conscience great pause before spending money at this place! This epitomizes what happens when corporate greed and thinking like an automaton replaces customer service, thoughtfulness and compassion."}
{"text":"Horrible service, waitresses were too busy playing games and laughing at each other to help customers.  One even dropped a tray because they we having too much fun. I had to bus half the table...Instead of the waitress going to the other side of the table to grab dishes, I had to bus my end of the table and hand it to her....REALLY??  Drinks were bad and when we sent them back, instead of making new ones, the bartender tried to adjust the bad drinks.  Come on guys, get some REAL bartenders and waitresses in there!!   Food was just ok.  We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"First time at Topgolf in Gilbert. Came in on a Friday night with no reservations and they looked very busy. As we were walking in there was 3 large buses unloading people. But still it didn't take much time to get all signed up for a lifetime membership. 2 hours seem to fly by. Lots of fun! Even though I'm not very good at it.  The staff were very friendly and helpful. We had the nachos and drinks. Our waitress was very busy and kept us served. I should have gotten her name. It was a great time with good friends. 
Thank you Topgolf we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Top golf is one of my favorite places to go to when we don't want to go out. Such a fun atmosphere. Good music, drinks and food available that come straight to your bay (love their chicken wings :p), and games to play while you wait. They have huge, like HUGEEEE, big screen TVs to watch all games inside (with lots of seating, first come first serve) and outside past the range. Also, there are multiple bars on every level to grab a drink while you wait.

In the summer they have the AC blasting in your bay and in winter, they've got heaters to offset the cold!

The reason I knock off a star is because there is usually always a wait. While they have so many bays on 4 different levels, they're always busy! They accept reservations but I believe there is a minimum to reserve.

I highly recommend this place to those who want some non-nightlife activity, especially for bachelor parties."}
{"text":"What a fun experience but the food sucked! We went on a busy Saturday night but fortunately we reserved a bay. The atmosphere was great and very diverse. I loved that the golf field was lit up with different colors. The screen that showed you your performance was a great interactive way to stay engaged. Again, the food was terrible and overpriced. We did have a pineapple alcoholic drink which was ok. If I go back it will be just to play golf"}
{"text":"Two of us go there to practice. One is a novice who needs practice with woods and driver. 
They tell us it will be $70.00 for the first hour ($35.00 each). First shock, as we usually practice for about 90 minutes. So that means we need to buy two more hours. so now we re up to about $130.00.
Than we are told we are not allowed to use our driver, woods or hybrids. We can use theirs. What good is that?
We went to a local driving range bought buckets of balls and had a great two hour practice session.
We heard they were \"pricey\" but this was out of line."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and it's definitely a fun place to go when visitors are in town. I don't know what my motivation would be as a local on a regular basis, but our out-of-town visitors had a great time, whether they were avid golfers or not.

The wait has never been too terrible for us and in one case, they called us earlier than the 30 minutes they said they would be. Still, I wouldn't suggest going here without a reservation if you are trying to \"squeeze\" it into a busy scheduled day. 

It's Topgolf, so most everything is impressive, and even the flatbreads and drinks are yummy. One thing that is a little annoying to me is that they tout locals prices, but they never ask you when they bring your bill out (when it matters) for your ID. So, if you're a local or with a local, make sure to pay attention to the bill. It's not a huge discount but that's not the point!

Also, of course the higher the floor the more VIP/more money, but the main floor is the only place I've been and it's been a great time. Our hitting bays have been on the side and right smack dab in the middle and you can still hit the ball from anywhere. Also, IT'S OK IF YOU STINK at golf, no one judges! :)"}
{"text":"Second time here and I've gotta say... Scottsdale can't be beat.
This Gilbert customer service was NOT on point. The counter people weren't friendly, and our host was trying to act smart with me. I made eye contact, smiled, and nodded to maybe 3 or 4 different hosts that didn't acknowledge me back. Then the security guard came and bothered us when we weren't even doing anything wrong. I didn't come here with my 14 year old brother and disabled father to be harassed by some rent a cop. I think he yelled at us because we were the only people there that weren't white. 

The food was ok."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with my family on a Monday night, and while I had a fun time (because I don't let a bad facility ruin a good family time) the place was garbage.
The service was incredibly slow, like an hour to get the food we ordered and probably 20 minutes for drinks.
Our waitress was super sweet but the other workers were crabby and rude.
We ordered chips and guacamole which you would think would be a pretty quick appetizer...it was part of that one hour wait I told you about. I mean I think they're planting and harvesting the damn avocados. Like I said, this was a Monday night it wasn't busy and I didn't see any avocado trees...
Oh yeah and the chips came out stale.
And the manager somehow tricked my uncle into purchasing Top Golf memberships when he was told they were free lol! But that was some kind of ridiculous miscommunication.
Anyways, slow service, crabby workers and stale chips. I'd rather not come here again. Which is too bad because it COULD be a pretty fun place!"}
{"text":"I came with a group of five on a Friday night and the wait was about 30 minutes which is expected on a weekend. The staff was accommodating and friendly. My group and I had fun golfing and ended the evening having a great conversation with the team lead Michelle. We will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Really cool Top Golf location. The first two floors are at a lower rate and the third floor is the most expensive. Even though you're paying more for the top floor, it does come with premium clubs. 

We came around 10am to get the cheapest rate for the day and we were able to walk right in. After a couple of hours when we were done, there was a massive line and pretty much all of the bay's were full. 

On the third and fourth floor there is even a swimming pool. Since we went during winter, it was closed at that time, but it was just like a Vegas day club. They also have a couple of shuffle board tables and a corn hole available to play with on the second floor. It does get petty busy at those games as well so either come early or be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"This place is a blast! Great way to keep up your swing in the summer. I call it \"lazy golf.\" Great for family or work events. I've done both there. Good for people who suck at golf because of the golf games where you don't have to be good. PS, food is good, and the wings are BOMB!"}
{"text":"This is awesome, really enjoyed our self here.? Not much of a golfer, but the games made it fun. Will be back again."}
{"text":"We came in a few weekends ago after just relocating from Scottsdale to Gilbert. We we are used to sometimes having to wait quite a while at the Scottsdale location. While waiting for our bay we sat downstairs at the bar and the bartenders were extremely friendly and seemed to be enjoying their time. When we got to our bay we had outstanding service from our server for the 2 hours we were there. I wish I had hung onto the receipts so I could acknowledge their service delivery. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We walked in after my sons graduation and was able to get on a waitlist that was not very long. We didn't wait for more than a hour. 

I love that they have games for all ages on the second floor. The service here is awesome! From reservation all the way down to the service we got in our bay was great! I wish I could remember the ladies name who served us. She was on point with everything and had great customer service.

Thank you for making this an awesome experience for my son and my family who came from out of town to celebrate my sons HS graduation."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, it's fun for all ages. Anything from family fun, to dates, to girls night out or bachelor parties to corporate events!  A really fun way to spend a couple hours. 

If you haven't tried them yet, must order the donut balls that come with filling injection shots.  And if you have stronger willpower than  me and pass on the donuts, don't worry the menu is filled with so many other delicious options. 

The drinks here are also good, and you can't beat the beautiful desert sunset views. Great place."}
{"text":"This is a review of the restaurant. Usually the nachos are pretty good. However, I recently came and had the Mushi plate. It was terrible. Do not order this. It was very very dry. The service we had recently was also pretty bad. Normally the experience is good, that is why I am rating this a 3. The service is never consistent."}
{"text":"Great place for the family or group of friends! We went Sunday afternoon and they were so accommodating! They put us in bays next to our friends who had arrived earlier. Kids (age 5-17) had a blast golfing as did the adults! Service was great as was the food. Better food than expected! I highly recommend this place for an afternoon with the family! Everyone was smiling the entire time:) we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Always a great time here.  Great for kids (just ask to be on the first level so no one falls over board).  Fairly priced at $25 per hour.  The food is surprisingly amazing too!  Five stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! We have been here 20+ times. I highly highly recommend it. The ONLY reason I gave 4 stars is because, I've been here so many times and spent so much $$$ and today, they refused to allow me to bring in my Starbucks coffee! :( This seems ridiculous to me but we still love this place"}
{"text":"This place has the absolute worst service upstairs. The guy with the blue shirt with the name tag \"rockstar\" and the guy in the green shirt \"Austin\"  will absolutely ignore you when the bar isn't even full. Their customer service is terrible. You end up waiting so long for a person that acts like they hate their job. Don't waist your time dealing with them."}
{"text":"Topgolf Las Vegas is very nice. Great location to see the fire works on NYE. My family and I decided to do something different for New Year's and rent a bay at Topgolf. We knew about the $250 deposit that was required before booking for their private event. Which included 3 hours of golfing for up to 6 people, unlimited well drinks (below $10) and soda. Of course you have to pay for food, which isn't unreasonably priced. 

We show up around 9pm, check in and went straight to our bay. I had myself, two kids which weren't golfing, my parents, sister and boyfriend. I was told that there was going to be a fee for the children even if they weren't golfing because \"they rented out the place for this event so they were limited on space.\" In the contact it states \"each area accommodates a specific number of guests. Should your guest count increase beyond the capacity of the area reserved for your group, Topgolf will accommodate additional guests if possible, based on availability, and a $20 per person surcharge along with other applicable per person charges will be applied to your final invoice.\" I had no idea that the surcharge was going to be $150. I of course argued that the price was not mentioned in the contract and that's ridiculous to pay that for a 3 year old. A manager came to me and said they he'll reach out to the GM to see what they can do. Came back with $99 again for my 3 year old. Long story short, we received our receipt and saw that she was basically charged the adult beverage package, but she's a child. 

I understand that the extra adult that came was $150, which I have no problem with, but to charge a child $99 for alcohol she can't drink is beyond ridiculous. Make sure you read your contract with them and ask questions, because it's not a very detailed contract. This isn't the first time Topgolf has basically screwed me over, but it's certainly the last.

Update: Carrie from Topgolf, was very professional and provided great customer service to get to the bottom of what happened. I must say I am very satisfied and I appreciate her efforts. Thanks Carrie!"}
{"text":"So much fun - Highly recommend going here! Here's our breakdown: We had a group of 6 that went today for the first time, (2 people are avid golfers, the other 4 have never touched clubs). We arrived on a Saturday around 3:00PM...We had created accounts ahead of time, which sped up the \"check-in\" process...We requested a third tier bay (we had read those have the best views) and were escorted to our area within 5 minutes. It was $52 for an hour and a half of play time (so worth it!). Then we all had a round of drinks and split 3 flatbreads, which cost about $65 + tip. Our server was great (thanks Haley!) and the food was delicious. We got through an entire game of 20 balls per person (I recommend each person hitting at least 4 balls/turn, it flows a little better). We will definitely be going again! (Also, apparently after 6:00PM is when the hour wait starts, so that's when they recommend using the $50 priority pass thingy.)"}
{"text":"This place sucks. It has such a big hype for nothing. Their drinks come in plastic cups..... But the kind that makes your drink taste disgusting. Even just an ice water is nasty. Beer is pretty much served warm. Who wants to drink a warm beer?  There's hidden fees. They are very deceiving when giving out info. Customer service is whack!

Here we go:
We planned to come here for my bro in law's bday. My sister was having such a hard time calling to get info on if we should or even could make reservations or not.  Even customer service on the phone sucked. We couldn't get solid answers for anything.  We ended up just showing up and getting on the wait list. We had about 10 people expected to come. My sister ask 1 girl how big each bay was... The girl showed her how big and she was pretty satisfied about it....... Until we got seated and it wasn't nearly as big as the girl told her! It was actually about half the size!  It was $75/HR for that half bay which could supposedly sit 10 people. (Yeah, if we sit on each other's laps!!!). We sat down and found out that each person has to pay an additional $5 if they want to golf.. I get it, it's only $5. BUT why didn't anyone tell us this from the beginning?   We spoke to so many people and no one mentioned extra fees to play.  Sooooo you pretty much just reserve a spot in front of a golf ball and golf clubs BUT you can't actually play until you pay more than the $75/HR you're already paying. Then we ordered drinks..... They showed us the drink menu and we almost got the bottle service. As we were sitting to discuss we had a server (Eva I think? And some other guy..) we couldn't even really discuss amongst ourselves if we wanted the bottle service because 2 people in the group were trying to sign up to play with one of the workers (and pay their extra $5) and the rest of us were debating on the drinks. Ultimately, it was the approach of the workers that made it feel disorganized.  They stood there and stared as we tried to decide. I had to tell them that we needed a minute so they could get out of our faces. We later decided to order our drinks.  They came out fairly quickly but again.. They were all WARM. The prices are through the roof at this place. Yes, it's a gorgeous view and pretty cool atmosphere, but most definitely not worth any of the cost what so ever. My husband ordered chicken wings that everyone could share but we didn't get any plates. We just had to pass around the serving dish and eat out of it until we could flag our waitress down for some plates. When it came closer to our hour they asked if we wanted to extend for an extra hour. By that time our mood was at the point of annoyed and we tried to figure out if we should go somewhere else. We had about EIGHT minutes left in the hour.. We were told if we don't decide if we want to extend the hour we have to move all our stuff and finish the rest of our food somewhere on the side of the building. Are. You. Kidding. Me?!! The absolute WORST service ever!  Whoever is in charge of training the staff should be terminated immediately. They have absolutely no idea what is going on, they do not know how to answer questions, or they're all just idiots. Oh! To end the night off we had to wait 837363836374 hours for our car in valet. (Which by the way is your only option to park unless you want to walk from MGM.) Top golf...  You're a joke."}
{"text":"Topgolf is great for the hole family. My experience was great for this place. You don't need golf experiences, my family had fun just laughing and making memories. The food here is amazing, especially their Mac and cheese.  It was heavenly. I think the  only thing I wish is that if someone ball goes into the thing and we see it clearly went in sometimes I didn't showed up so I think the should fix that, but everything else spot on."}
{"text":"Yes, I am a huge fan because this is just such a cool idea. How clever! This location had an amazing view of the Vegas strip from the location of driving range stations. Also, the staff at the front desk was absolutely amazing. Not gonna lie, my group was coming together in small pieces and we kept changing our time, but the staff was so kind, and did their best to accommodate us. That was truly awesome. Literally...they were so nice! 

My only major concern was the food....We ordered a few flat breads and they were extremely dry. The spinach on mine was in wet clumps and made the taste quite soggy. No flavor either. Looking forward to Topgolf improving their menu (hopefully) in the future! All in all, a great experience."}
{"text":"Fun concept but the service was far below par. They are unenthusiastic and act like they don't want to b there. What a shame this could b a five star if they trained and oriented their staff correctly."}
{"text":"Fun time.

The food was surprisingly, unexpectedly good for what you'd expect in this type of venue. Our group had bbq platter, a cheese/charcuterie platter....this one was my favorite...taco platter, and sushi platter. Tons of food on each tray and a good selection. 

Free parking, easy check in when you're with a group. Tons of staff everywhere, you are never looking for a waiter. Clean bathrooms. Nice wine selection. 

1 star off because the scoring and instructions weren't 100% clear. And the locks on the bathroom stalls were sticky. I got stuck in a stall. 

A-"}
{"text":"Topgolf is a great concept, but this location is very poorly executed. The waiter didn't know one thing about the drinks we ordered, but at least he was pleasant. Every food order was wrong from the kitchen. The line to get a new card was moving so slowly, it was out the door and out into the parking lot, and took us over an hour to get through. The computers kept crashing, the registers went down at the bar, the game consoles shut down, etc. A waitress dropped an entire tray of drinks and a pitcher at the back of our bay, then disappeared. My sister had to grab all of our napkins to stop it all from running into our green! It seems like they made a recruiting run at the local retirement home. The (obviously too old) lady inside the front door asked us four separate times if we were new players within a 10 minute time period, and the parking nazi out front was the final straw. He wouldn't let us stop in front to pick up the rest of our party, just kept repeating \"you can't park here\" as we tried to explain we were just picking up. He was so mean and rude!! I guess if they're trying to scare off customers, they're doing a great job."}
{"text":"So I learned something new about myself tonight... I am terrible at golf. That's ok though because to play Top Golf you don't really have to be very good at all. My husband and I haven't been out to do something fun in awhile so we stopped by to share a pitcher of beer and play a few games and it was so much fun! It kind of reminds me of bowling but not really because it's golf. It keeps score depending on which circle you get your ball in so maybe that's why I kept thinking of bowling :) either way, it's a lot of fun! They have a pretty cool bar, the menu is great and the view of the mountains is beautiful. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Top golf is a very cool place. It's like a bowling ally but on a driving range. I had a lot of fun with my family and friends. 

The food was pretty good as well. I do see myself going there again."}
{"text":"On a Thursday evening I joined some work mates here for a night of golf and dinner and couldn't have been more impressed. 
 I'll preface my review with the fact that I don't golf, I'm not good at golf, and don't like playing. If this is you you'll definitely have fun here and if you like golf then you'll be in heaven! 
 We had an event reservation and a buffet style dinner. Of the offerings I enjoyed the pesto macaroni salad, the country style beans, the brisket was just ok but the BBQ sauce helped in that department, and the full yourself doughnut holes were super yummy. 
 As for golf I loved that they had some good tunes playing and at intervals the holes would dance with light in sync with the music.
 The final kicker for me was seeing the staff really enjoy themselves. They were dancing, laughing, overall it seemed like they were having fun which I really enjoy to see."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and man did it blow my mind.  You can drink, eat, and play golf in your own little area. Super great spot for a date and the crowd is cool too. Across the street is the Talking Stick Resort if you get too wasted or just want to gamble after."}
{"text":"Top Golf is located near the MGM, and if you are in Vegas this golf arena should be your next place to visit! Top Golf is a multi level golf putting arena with stocked up bars, a pool, and a lounge area with big screen tvs for the sports fan. 

This is my first time here and I am not a golfer but it is a fun atmosphere to hang out with my friends. The menu offers a variety of foods from Grilled New York Strip,  wings, flatbreads, Burgers and sliders and Cabana packages. 

This is a kid friendly place, it's a fun for the whole family hall around. 

Top Golf is totally entertaining! I am very impressed."}
{"text":"This place is kind of a cool concept. Instead of a standard driving range, there are targets and all the balls are microchipped so you can tell exactly how far you hit and if you hit any targets. It gives a bit of a competitive element to the game. 

Think of it like paying for a bowling lane by the hour. You get up to 6 players in one bay and each round is 20 balls per player. You can decide how to divvy that up with your party. Just touch the screen to change players.

I feel an hour is a bit short for a game if you are playing leisurely. We kinda had to rush a bit towards the end of the hour to finish our game. We had 5 people. I think if you have 6 people playing, you may need more than 1 hour if you want to drink and play at the same time.

Service was good and staff was friendly. We played at noon on a Friday, so the cost was $60 for a floor 2 bay. The prices change depending on the time of day. Evening/Night hours are the most expensive, but probably the most beautiful with all the Vegas lights. I think mornings might be best for a summer day so it isn't too hot and you can still see where you are hitting the ball."}
{"text":"Not a golfer hate waiting around for someone to hit a ball walk and then hit it again, but this is fun. This place is awesome.  Love hitting the ball from two stories up hearing it whizz through the air and hit a target far off.  I'm terrible at golf but this is fun.  All the goods parts of golf mainly hitting the ball far with power.   The staff is very attentive and the menu looks great, but did I tell you how fun it is to hit the ball over and over again."}
{"text":"The truth is I have never done any kind of golfing in my life! But because there was a group of 32 of us and 90% of the group were guys we had to come visit top golf. The facility is cool and state of the art. I liked how they had clubs for leftys on site and brought them out quickly. The beer towers were super cool, and the yellowtail sashimi was delicious. Even though I was terrible I still loved it. The only thing is I wished the first 2 floors had cool themes and views just like the upstairs. For people paying a certain amount for larger groups I would think something cooler could accommodate. Maybe spice up the 2 first floors a little more."}
{"text":"f I could give zero I would! I called to book a reservation for 10. I couldn't book unless there were 12 of us. So, we arrive....2 hour wait!  But, we can get in right away if we go online and pay $50. So, I go online and the lady punches in the numbers I need...nope, won't work. So, she asks the manager, she enters a different number...nope, doesn't work. We offer to pay $50 cash...nope! The last time we were there our tab was $400+ with 6 of us! Imagine 10 of us. Unbelievable! I've been there several times and will NEVER GO BACK! UNBELIEVABLE!"}
{"text":"One of the most exciting venues in the east valley. Food was excellent!  We had to wait over and hour to get out bay to start playing. We felt it was worth the wait.  Since it just opened, it was jam packed.  The waiting staff was extremely unorganized.  We had to wait 30 minutes just to place food order.  Overall,impressed this entertainment venue. Will be visiting many times in the future."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience, waited in line for 10 minutes, $5 membership, drivers license and email address provided and then they tell me there's a 2.5 hour waiting to hit the ball!!!! I decided not to get a membership since I wasn't playing, I go to the bar for a cold one, waited 15 minutes at the bar with no luck. At this point I decide to take my crew and go bowling horrible place, not recommended until they get their act together."}
{"text":"I am updating my review. This place is a joke. We came here for my brother In laws bday. We waited about 30 mins not bad. When we got seated we was told we had to pay $5 each for membership wtf!!! Why wasn't this told to us when we checked in at the front desk or when my sister in law called them for prices. I ordered chicken wings ( Asian zing) which was bomb but no plates was giving. I had to literally yell \"canny get a plate\". We had 8 mins left and the worker said would we like to extend. We said maybe can we think about it and finish our food and decide. She said no if we didn't want to extend we couldn't finish out good and we would have to get our shit and move to side. Hahahha wtf!!! I would never come back to this place or nor will I recommend it."}
{"text":"TopGolf is the place to be for a great time in AZ. Megan and Trey are the best. Really took care of our group in town from Florida. Highly recommend to anyone who is in town."}
{"text":"Very comfortable seating. Great fun. And great food!! Just drinks are pricey and filled with ice.. other then that this place is wonderful. And the view from the bay is amazing!"}
{"text":"What a great and fun experience. Top of the line servers. Great food and fun. Spectacular view while golfing. We tried the wings and nachos. Everything was delicious. Hope to go back the next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Open to noon $25/hr
Noon to 5pm $35/hr
5pm to close $45/hr
Membership card $5

Food was great and the experience was worth the price! I had the chicken and waffle sliders and I can proudly say that I have nothing to complain about! To keep this short and sweet... I'll be coming here again!"}
{"text":"OMG! I wish we had a TopGolf here in San Diego. Please....come to San Diego!  We stopped in here while we were visiting family in Phoenix as a fun little day outing. I'm a big golfer so was a little hesitant on what this \"Top Golf\" was all about but it turned out to be SO MUCH FUN!

If you're not familiar with Top Golf, it's like a driving range on steroids. No, on crack! First off, the facilities were gorgeous and very well organized. You are greeted right when you walk in, there is an area to the right to check in and get your clubs if you don't have any--and then you're escorted to your private section. Each station has a terminal/computer where you enter the player names and the games you wish to play.  

What I loved most was how each area was under a large covered patio to protect you from the elements and each had a very comfortable seating area with tables where you can sit, relax, order appetizers, drinks and even have a full blown lunch/dinner if you wanted. While everyone was ordering cocktails, I was so grateful they had an all natural Ginger Ale. I was going to town with those babies. 

We had 4 people in our party and we all had different skill levels so the pre programmed games were perfect. I can't recall the names of the games we selected but random targets were given and each of us had a certain amount of balls to hit each one. The closer you got to the target, the more points you got. It was an absolute blast. I also had limitations because I'm preggo but it could not have been a more perfect outing for us. We were having so much fun, we played for hours. 

The table service was fantastic and they're on it. As soon as our drinks or appetizers were getting low, they replenished quickly. We thought their prices on the food were pretty reasonable too. We thought we would only be there for an hour to play one game...we ended up spending hours there. 

I'm sure we'll be back again during one of our annual trips out to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I have to say that it's a great environment, the golf was a blast especially if you are with good people. Unfortunately the service was the worst that I have experienced. We were greeted right from the start and said we needed a moment to look at the menu. We never saw the server again until our time was up and they were asking if we wanted to add time. We got a second hour because the golf itself was fun. We then went to the bar to serve ourselves and then, and only then, our server shows up... I truly believe the server didn't care to serve us because they thought we were under 21 and it wasn't worth their time (which all of us were). As a server and with other industry people this scenario would have been ideal to serve... With five people and nearly the late night meal time both food and cocktails could have built a nice check. But seeing our server once every 55 minutes is a bit ridiculous. A 5 star venue and a 5 star experience but failed to serve its patrons."}
{"text":"I organized a company event held here. 

We had absolutely excellent service by the staff and event organizer contact. We reserved 3 bays and cabanas by the pool and gave us ample space to play and lounge. Food was decent, with a few gusta of wind hot apps got cold quickly, but with such excellent service with drink orders no one but this event manager seemed to mind. The game itself is fantastic and not intimidating to non golf players which is ideal for corporate events. Overall I recommend.

Event management services: 5/5
Service: 10/5 - seriously the staff they had working our bays were super friendly and on top of it 100%. Really made my guests feel well taken care of 
Food: 3/5
Place: 5/5, bays by the cabanas on the third floor are the best!"}
{"text":"The food here is great and the service is pretty good too, but I wouldn't recommend this place because of the safety issue.

I've seen people swinging their golf clubs outside of the red zone.  And of course, sometimes there are more than 1 person in the red zone when one of them is hitting the ball while the other person was chatting.  Any golfer would know that having two people in the red zone is very dangerous and would be very cautious about it.  But this is not a place for just regular golfers.  It's for families or friends to get together whether they golf or not.  However, I did not see any of them got warned for doing what they were doing.  Again, great idea, bad management here.

Also, there was a golfer chasing his golf ball from his red zone to our red zone when one of my friends was about to take a swing.  Again, no staff tried to stop that or approach the ball-chaser and explain the safety rules.  Did any of the staff saw that?  Of course.  But it's probably not waitress's responsibility to report this issue as long as no blood spilled?

There is a good chance that I will get a feedback stating \"we will immediately address your concern\" but I doubt it will really be seriously addressed until a major accident takes place and gets on the news. So for the time being, I would avoid this place so I am not the one ending up on the news."}
{"text":"Loved the facility and views are amazing while hitting high tech golf! The food menu was good and the quality was good."}
{"text":"Dropped by today spontaneously with my two boys. Didn't expect much, because my boys are young AND have never golfed before AND because I don't know jack about golf to teach them. Figured we'd see what they offered, and at minimum just hang out a bit. I could never have expected the kindheartedness of their employee, Bryson, that fortunately ventured over our way. When the greeter explained our situation to him, he tried explaining to us that their Pro didn't start until 4 that day (it was about 2:45 at that point) and that regardless - he was booked when he arrived until close. I told him I didn't mind since we were going to do something there regardless, but to just point me in the direction of the least challenging things he could come up with. He smiled, and said that he'd put us in a cube (not the official term - I just can't recall what it's called) and he'd come over and instruct the boys himself for a \"little bit\" on proper golf posture, swing, and bla-di-bla, but he wouldn't charge me since he wasn't an official \"Golf Pro\" himself. He directed me to the sign in, and got us all registered and such. After we were properly routed to whatever you call it, he joined us with a set of kid clubs and proceeded to spend at least TWENTY MINUTES personally instructing my two children (9 and 4, no less) on how to hold and swing a golf club. God bless him for his patience, but our trip to the driving range was transformed from a hot mess into a life changing event. Both of my boys immediately took to Bryson, and followed him with wide eyed interest like I've never seen before. The two of them are NOT the sports type, so watching them suck this up like sponges made me very happy, and when the hour was over hearing them beg for more was a dream come true. Bryson was smiling, happy, and truly a gentleman for the entire time he spent voluntarily with us. This kid is going to have a very successful future if he commits to a career like he committed to us today - and let me tell you, I was one, hot, sweaty, stinky, disgusting mess of a woman today. I surely wasn't expecting the royal treatment from anyone - but I really couldn't have been bothered, because I was on my way to the gym after that. I say this only to point out that this kid DID give me and the kids the royal treatment - in spite of the gigantic mess I presented. For him - at that age - to be so honestly nice and make my kids feel so special is a rare thing. Everyone else at Topgolf treated me very well also, but they treated me the way I would've expected - very nice, but kind of from a distance. And I get that. There is nothing wrong with that. I understand - you totally get out of life what you put into it. And that is my point precisely. This kid is exactly who you want to work with if you get to this place - he will work with you because it's what he's there to do, and it's what he wants to do. And he's going to be absolutely fabulous as he's doing it. And he's going to make you and your family feel the same way as he's doing it. I know that my boys came home and were bragging to their dad about how awesome they did today, and my husband was so pleased to see this excitement over a sport. We have ordered some golf equipment to put up in the backyard, and are planning on making a future out of this. All from one day involving this gem of a kid. :-)"}
{"text":"So glad they brought Topgolf to Vegas. My husband went to the one in Houston when he went for a bachelor party and they said they had a lot of fun. I am so glad we got to try it this past weekend in Vegas. 

We went in a group of ten. Walked in and didn't make any reservations prior, but we only had to wait half an hour to get a Bay on the first level. The levels increase in price the higher you go and there are four floors. As we were waiting, they have a full bar inside and places to sit. There's also cornhole if you're bored and want to play. 

They get you set up with six players but we rotated between the six of us. The first part where they set us up with six cards that were membership cards was kind of tedious, we just wanted to get in and play. Someone explained the games to us and showed us how everything works. It's neat that the screen, balls, and everything are all computerized and it'll show you how far you hit the ball or which color zone it landed in. 

We started playing and you pay by the hour. There's some comfy couches to sit when you aren't hitting. You also get a waitress who will take food and drink orders. We ordered the five layer dip, chicken wings, and popcorn shrimp, all were good. We also kept the drinks coming. 

Love the cool misting fans!!! It was nice to hang out in the shade and in the coolness since we knew it was hot outside (summertime), such a better way to spend an afternoon rather than at a day club. 

We went to go take a look at the pool on the third floor too. It's much hotter up there, less shade and in direct sunlight. The pool is small, there were a few people in there. Some cool pool inflatables like a donut and pizza. There's also a DJ up on the third floor playing music. In my opinion, it was too hot up there, glad we were on the first floor. I think second level might be best. Since the view is cooler and it's also in the shade. 

Would definitely come back in the future! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke! So unprofessional and disrespectful!!! They profile ! I guess because I wore Jordan's and have braids I'm not worthy of great service.. smh sad. After TWO games of golf my friend and I sat at a table waiting to get service so we can order food. After 10 minutes of staff just walking by not acknowledging us AT ALL I got someone's attn. I asked the worker what time does the kitchen close he said 1:30 and it was 1am. I asked to put a order in to go and he told me one minute he'll send some one over. 15 minutes go by and NO ONE has stopped and said anything so once again I flag down another staff member asking her if I can place a to go order with her and she responds \"the kitchen is closed now\". Funny how it's closed at 1:15 and the other guy said 1:30. Which is it. So I asked to speak to a manager.. eventually he comes out, I believe his name was Nicolas or Andrew. Which ever claims to be an hospitality manager.. and this is where I felt very disrespected!! I tell him how we've waited and sat at the same table for over 30 minutes with NO service, was never acknowledged and all I want is to order food to go and it still hasn't happened. He tells me \"well yea the kitchen is closed now sooo \" looking at me like there's nothing he can do. So I ONCE again tell this man how WE HAVE BEEN WAITING and ASKED TWO different people at two separate times to order food and I KNOW THE kitchen wasn't closed when I sat down. He goes on and tells me \"well I'll see what I can do but you'll have to pay for your food first cause we wouldn't want any problems\". WHAT DOES THAT MEAN!!? Why would there be a problem!!? Are u judging I can't afford your prices? Are u assuming I will leave with out paying? What made u assume that ? PROFILING ! So to my better judgement I said no problem, paid for my food before getting it and sat and waited. I've told him specifically I want dipping sauces.. my food comes out in a box with no sauce, no napkins not even a bag to carry it in..just the to go box. So I'm walking towards the exit and I open the food to see if there's any sauce on the inside and of course it's not so I asked another worker I see at a computer can I please having dipping sauce.. he tells me the kitchen is closed, they can't make anything. CLEARLY NOT LISTENING cause blue cheese and ranch dipping sauce is not made to order. So once AGAIN I'm looking around like Am i in a twilight zone!! Meanwhile I see all the staff that I have spoke with talking through ear pieces, staff are looking at us saying things. No one is stupid, you know when you're being watched and talked about. Sad things is as I walk over to the bar to ask the bar tender and as I walk pass a group of staff I can LITERALLY hear them talking about what's happening with me and my food. That's unprofessional! So now everybody wants to be involved! I sat at the bar waiting for my sauce and Another female manager comes out with the \"let me play confused and talk soft like everything is fine \" . First thing out her mouth was \"I heard what happened\". I knew it was seriously time to go. Smh meanwhile I went home with soggy food, feelings disrespected ! A very uncomfortable feeling. It was my idea to come and golf because I've been before but maybe my prior experience was better because I was with a majority or Caucasians. You guys should be ashamed !! Close your doors if you're scared or feel a need to racial profile and treat others differently!! We're not going anywhere . Never did anyone ask are we ok or apologized for y'all lack or service! Just pure ignorance !! I'll never spend another dollar at this establishment !!"}
{"text":"We come here often and it is always a fantastic time. Anthony talked to us and made sure we were taken care of. All the staff is wonderful, highly recommend for a night out or a day with friends or family!"}
{"text":"Have been here over 50 times since opening a couple years ago. Spent a lot of money on VIP passes to jump the line and even more on food and drinks. The past three times I have been there I noticed many changes for the worse. First, even though I have been there 50+ times they act like it is my first and make me wait for somebody to show me how the bay works.  Annoying as heck.  Had to wait, even though I paid $50 for a VIP pass, an extra 20 mins for somebody to show me to the bay. Second, the service is horrible. They need to train the staff.  Rude, no empathy, no please and thank you, no nothing.  Third, the bartenders are the worst.  They have no idea how to make a great drink except pouring a beer. Do not have a margarita, they are horrible.  Fourth, the bay we were in you cannot change the channel on TV because it was broken.  They are not keeping up on maintenance.  Fifth, the balls kept getting stuck and not coming out.  Had to have them reset it 5 times in 2 hours.

My opinion is they have leadership and management issues. Focused on profit now and not long term.  They could care less about a long term loyal customer and think they can keep attracting first time visitors. They will not make it 5 years from now if they do not change the service"}
{"text":"Consistent at being a disappointment and making booking a resevation package an effort in fruatration. EVERY step they managed to make being on site a challenge. Booking: I emailed and then called and emailed again to no response and eventually decided to personally walk in and book the golf bay. 

 Once NYE arrived i walked up to the counter and theres 4 of them and no one in line because we showed up after it started.  They had NO idea I had a reservation and kept asking for my name. Whats worse is that i received a Christmas card from , DJ, who booked the golf package for me saying they look forward to seeing me which was a nice touch. After standing around they eventually find our resevation and seat us. 

The lady takes us to the cabana shows us quickly how it works and walks away. For the amount we paid we thought wrist bands would be waiting for us and we could start the party. Theres definately a lack of communication about what was going on. So we had to track down the cabana host for the first time of many that night. When I stepped away to the bar, as we didnt have a host, someone accosted the rest of my group for a credit card instead of using the card on file or asking me for it. Its so rude to ask other people who i was treating for a credit card.  Terrible! When you're paying over $800 for a golf bay your server should be there upon your arrival. I suppose since she already has been tipped over $125 with the contract shes free to float around and disappear throughout the night. It was such a terrible experience especially when they only give you 3 hours.

We finally found her and ordered food.

  Its time to cash out and she's upfront, personal and ready to help. After checkout and the credit card is signed they turn off the heaters and send someone around to shut down your golf game regardless of where youre at in the game.  If youre not paying to extend your play on NYE then too bad, they already have your money. We stepped away at one point to take a picture and they had completely cleaned all of our drinks off the table. Didnt even ask us. 

Where were these people at to take your drink order or food order an hour ago? Who knows. They already got paid so it doesnt matter. We go to the bar at 12:01 to get one last drink and they said it ends at midnight although the event goes until 1230. 

Will i come back? Heck no! Will i send my guests, family or friends? Heck no. Who wants to pay a lot of money on a special occassion to be treated like a paycheck to their staff. These people are worse than bottle servers! At least bottle servers are there when you need them. At Topgolf they make the whole experience from start to finish frustrating. Soon as youve paid.  GET OUT!"}
{"text":"Awesome staff, had my wife's Birthday party they're Kay might and had great experience.  Ask for the manager Chris or Tyson"}
{"text":"Topgolf is a great driving range/restaurant/bar.   Good for entire family regardless of skill level. 

BBQ nachos were good, turkey avocado wrap even better. Pretty good beer specials midweek...even better.

Place gets packed on weekends but during the week you can get on with no wait. 

Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Sooo much fun!!! We typically pay extra for the fast pass to jump the line and it is worth it! The service could improve as every server that we have had each time is a bit of a scatter brain. The food is great and the drinks are delicious!"}
{"text":"I spent 2-3 hours here with a couple of friends. None of us have any meaningful golf experience but we all had a blast. 5 stars. 

Food is typical pub fare: wings, pizza, etc. Great drinks, lots of TVs. Not exactly fine dining but it's not supposed to be. Totally met our expectations. 5 stars.

The top floor is totally child-free (21+) which is major plus for guys like me who actively avoid the presence of children. 5 stars for any establishment that offers child-free options ! 

Price for a bay on top floor was $100/hr + $270 food and drink minimum (for three people), so make sure you come hungry!

We did have one peculiar experience with our server though, and it's the the only reason for the three star review:

We had only used $170 of our $270 minimum not long before leaving, so we figured we'd use the remaining $100 on some to-go items. But our server Ruby H. went into panhandling mode, asking if we'd like to donate that $100 to \"feed the staff,\" implying that they apparently aren't paid enough money to feed themselves. I found this to be grossly inappropriate.

My friend politely declined and ordered a pizza and some other items to go. Server Ruby became argumentative at that point, claiming that it would be silly for us to spend that $100 on ourselves since the pizzas would \"never keep\" for any length of time anyway. She really fought tooth and nail with my friend, insisting that our $100 be  used to \"feed the staff\". Not to state the obvious, but she likely had no interest in feeding her coworkers; She clearly just wanted to feed *herself* using someone else's money. 

I suspect she tried to retaliate by adding a number of bogus items to our bill.

It was a truly surreal experience. We asked to speak with the manager, Miguel. He was apologetic and comp'd us a free hour of golf. He cleared out the bogus charges and stated he'd speak with server about her behavior. 

Manager also made it official: Aggressive panhandling by the servers is NOT allowed. This was presumably an isolated incident.

Strange experience with our server notwithstanding, it was a positive outing overall. Final recap: Pay the extra money for the top floor private bay. Totally worth it. Come hungry. If your server is Ruby H., watch out for panhandling at checkout time, and double-check your bill!"}
{"text":"So much fun! My husband is a golfer, So naturally this was a must stop. We came on a Wednesday around 6pm and requested the 3rd level (21 and over). We waited less than 5 minutes to get to our \"bay\". There, your hostess shows you around, how to play etc. A server comes to get your drink order and you're on your way. One con was the idea that you had to become a \"member\" for 5.00 that they tack on to your game and bill as you register. Seems like a stupid charge given its 75/hour to play. 

We ended our game and headed down to eat. Huge TVS, cornhole, ping pong, etc. 

Overall a fantastic evening!"}
{"text":"This place has a great process if you want to come with a fun group, you should give at least 2 hrs to commit to the experience.  In my opinion the staff in the waiting area are the best however they keep a cute staff of girls serving in the actual driving range areas.  If your really into that no matter what,  you'll enjoy this experience.  If the girl Nikki at the lounge area had stayed with us through out the experience I would have probably given this place a perfect 5 out of 5 which I rarely give however they switched is over to a Barbie with little interest in her guest in my opinion an even less personality or ability to make suggestions or recommendations that could increase your experience.  Regardless this place has a good enough process to ensure everyone leaves happy.  I would definitely recommend to any group."}
{"text":"It's a great casual golf experience. The customer service is horrible. We waited for our food for over an hour. When we finally got our food my husbands chicken wings were still bleeding. I explained this issue to the manager and she convinced me that the wings sometime just have \"veins\" that bleed. Not satisfied at all. Eat before you come would be by suggestion. It's not the money for the horrible food."}
{"text":"So we came to Top Golf to celebrate a friends 30th birthday. First person up cuts her hand from a sharp piece on TOP GOLFS golf club. Ask for a bandaid, something you would think they would just give you, nope, $5 for ONE bandaid. Really sad TopGolf, really sad."}
{"text":"Wonderful for golf and family love the couches, prices are a bit high. Like the shade and golf. Unable to change the tv channel which is a bummer when you have kids-the pools are 21 and over only and you have to pay for a cabana essentially per hour for everything . Great location. Lights are pretty blinding if you are driving south on koval."}
{"text":"We went to Top Golf on Wednesday night, between Christmas and New Year's Eve and it was a lot of fun.  We were entertaining family from out of town and it was our first time there.  It was incredibly busy but our line moved quickly due in large part to a staff member named Troy.  There was some sort of computer issue that started to back things up, but he fixed it quickly and kept everything running smoothly while still being genuinely friendly and helpful.  As we had some questions, he gave us all the best info and even made some great suggestions.  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Played cornhole for the few minutes we waited.  Hitting golf balls was a fun activity to mix among the party stuff in Las Vegas.  Pretty challenging for someone who hasn't played golf beyond miniature. Cost $30 for a half hour since we were headed to the next place shortly.  The computer tracked where we hit it, but I didn't like that it didn't keep score for each of us through our whole session.  Charging required $5 membership fee is lame when we don't want to be members."}
{"text":"I came here May 13th for the Andrew McMahon concert so this review is based solely on my concert experience - I did not golf during this visit.

I called ahead for the set times because their website only had 7:30pm listed but it was not clear if that was when the first band went on or if that's when doors would open. When I called they refused to give me the set times and just said the doors WOULD OPEN AT 7:30pm so I took that as a \"arrive at 7:30p and the event would start at 8pm\"

When we arrived at 7:30pm, the Valet was full and after 20 mins we decided no one was leaving and the only choice was to PAY to park at MGM and then take the free shuttle. We parked at MGM by 8pm only for there to be no free shuttle so we walked over and finally made it into the venue at 8:30pm to find out the second band was already performing. Great! This is why I wanted estimate set times so I wouldn't miss the first two bands.

Only the staff member holding the venue entrance door was polite the staff accepting the tickets were so rude. When we got to the bar all the bartenders were busy but instead of asking us to wait or thanking us for waiting they just ignored us until they had nothing better to do. When we finally got one of the bartenders attention she gave us attitude for my friend having a top golf gift card - why does that matter? you're getting paid either way.

Finally, Andrew performed and he was amazing of course. The security staff to the left of the stage was kind enough to move the trash can to let me stand against the barricade so I could watch the band with a decent view as I couldn't find a good view due to being late and short in height.

After the show we stayed for dinner at the bar and our server/bartender was new and actually really awesome. I hope I never have to go back here for a concert ever again but would like to try golfing or something else if the opportunity is given."}
{"text":"Top notch service. I had a large party and they were very accommodating to our drunk asses. The facility itself is very nice and easy to use. Clean bathrooms. The bill was also very reasonable for the amount of food, drinks (bottle), and golfing we did."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend this if you have not tried it. It is pretty cheap if you split it between friends too. ( I think pricing is anywhere from $30 to $50 per hour it depends on when you come in )

If your girlfriend must come along like mine always does and doesn't want to participate she will take a while to complain about wanting to leave since they do provide comfy lounge seating and alcohol. The only thing missing from that \"At home feeling\" for her would be whatever god awful tv series she binge watches at the moment."}
{"text":"Really a FUN way to spend a couple hours, whether your a golfer or not  In addition to golf they have pools on levels 3 & 4 plus lounges/cocktails on every level. Lots of employees to assist you too! On the main level the massive TV area also has shuffleboard, bag toss so literally something for practically everyone.
    We had lunch on the main floor and the wedge was very good, the sea bass sliders were also good and then the \"Mushi\" which looked like sushi but wasn't. This was a very generous portion too and on the spicy side~ 
    A FUN DAY! Was had by all."}
{"text":"After visiting another Top golf location I was a little disappointed with this one. 

The venue is extremely nice I must say, but the prices are a bit much. I guess I was expecting the same price range at this location but apparently each one is different. None the less of you're looking for a good date night just look forward to a pricey time. Being that the location I visited before was up north I was a little surprised with the cost of play and other things here in Charlotte ( I get it, you're paying for the experience but come on). Northern VA top golf charges by the game and you get a certain amount of balls with each game (great idea, doesn't keep you on a time limit and it's cost effective, you also don't mind spending more on other things). To keep in mind everyone will not travel in groups to a place like this, just like bowling etc. So the fees per hr to go to a \"driving range\" sounds a little excessive. 

I hope as time goes on they will get a little a better. Not sure what audience they are trying to target but I'm currently not a fan of this particular location (just on pricing alone)."}
{"text":"Last night I had planned a bachelor party starting the evening off at Top Golf in Scottsdale (Riverwalk). I had all the guests get memberships on TopGolf.com to save some time. Upon arriving there was a line out the door. I expected it to be busy since they opened recently. Fletcher at the membership desk was EXTREMELY helpful getting all my friends their memberships cards. We then were helped by David at the main desk and asked if we could get two spots next to each other to accommodate our party of 8. I had heard that it can take over an hour to get a spot but within 30 minutes David had fit us in and got us started. The whole experience was amazing and we all had a great time. Even my friends that had no golfing experience had a blast. I will be returning very soon and can't wait to try the other games we didn't have time for. I feel like the longer they are open the smoother the whole process will become but will recommend TopGolf to everyone I know. Thank you for making it such a great experience!"}
{"text":"We came for the first time on a Sunday! Wasn't too busy. It was fun, and the customer service was great. We didn't really eat there but we got drinks and an appetizer. Very good. Prices were decent.  Our server, I think his name was Christian was super nice and very attentive. We will go again."}
{"text":"We have visited this location several times, and We always ask for Kylee as our server now. She goes above and beyond to make our visit enjoyable. Our drinks are always replaced before they are finished, we are never left looking for her because she checks on us several times and is fast and efficient.  Gregory, a supervisor, is friendly, knowledgeable and makes a point to say hello and makes his rounds touching base and confirming customers are taken care of. The service here by all team members is top notch. They also have a wide selection of food and we have not been disappointed with anything we have tried. It tastes fresh and comes out to our table hot."}
{"text":"Most of the 4 and 5-star reviews cover this place in much more detail so I won't duplicate that info but suffice to say that their comments are on point. Fantastic facility!!! I had no idea that so much was going on at this place. Tons of fun for golfers and non-golfers alike. We had teens and grandmothers playing it was so much fun.

Food was to die for. How can wings and meat skewers be so good? I don't know but they were frickin' awesome and I'm a wing connoisseur.

The cost for 10 people, 1-3/4 hours, food and drinks - $540. Well worth it. Next time I will opt for the 4th level suites. Great for a family outing or a company event.

Why the four stars? Check-in had to be done in person hours before we were ready because the wait was two-hours. Not ideal, call-in reservations guaranteed by credit card would be better. Nice thing was that they called or texted you when they were ready for you so you could go back to the casino or wherever. However, when we got on the waiting list they told us we could have the bay for at least two-hours and longer if needed. But when we showed up they had another event booked which forced us to end early and rush a bit. Can't finish two games in that amount of time. It was annoying but still a five-star experience.

You have to go to Top Golf, can't wait til they get one in San Diego."}
{"text":"So I played twice in a week (at this facility), just to get this review right. Or maybe it was a total coinkidink and I just felt obligated to share my impression. 

First.
What you first have to do as a newbie here, is going to purchase a membership card. You can't play without one (to my knowledge) and it is $5. When you have your card, you have to go get yourself a bay. You can be many people at the bay, but max 6 can play at a time. 

Playing.
It is basically a driving range turned quasi-bowling, in the fashion that you have a half-set to your disposal and can shoot your ball into different sized and colored pits that from the top are arranged as a dart board - so the closer to the pin you get, the more scores. Sounds confusing? Good! You ball is automatically being tracked from the tee, to your potential score in one of the pits. 

But enough about that. this game is a real ice-breaker. Most people aren't that good and it is entertaining to both shoot and to watch miserable swings and hilarious results. And while this is going on, you have waitresses that come and serve food and drinks. Yes, it is a good idea altogether. 

Post. 
I didn't realize how big this place is. One big bar upstairs with a patio, and a DJ (at least in the evening) and a fairly big bar downstairs too. After we played we just hung out on the patio and had a few drinks and enjoyed the eclectic throw-back that the DJ apparently was stuck on. 

Summary. 
I like this place, and the idea. It is good for a date. It is good for a few people get together. It is good for a whole variety of potential situation where one need some time to talk, and yet want's to involve an activity while still having access to a full bar. And strangely enough this is completely family friendly."}
{"text":"We were here on Friday, what a fun night!  Only 1 of our party of 4 actually golfs but we gave it a try.  Needless to say we were terrible but it was hilarious, haven't laughed that hard in a while.  We tried the pizza, chicken wings and sliders all very good!  It's not your typical bar food and we loved it!  Want to give a shout out to the great service too!  We will be back, great addition to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Amber had the vegetable burger she said it was the fizzle . T Bone the grilled the grilled cheese he said it was soft in the middle crispy like a chip on the outside"}
{"text":"Pretty fun and chill environment. Order some food on the side and play some golf. If it is your first time here, the staff will show you how the play and you have the option to buy a membership for $5. We were a part of 12 but not all of us played. It was so much fun to just watch as well! Some of us never played golf so this was a first time experience. You can order food and drinks and enjoy your time. We played two games and it came out to be $180. After splitting with everyone, we ended up paying around $15 which is not bad for 2 hours of fun! Come with a good group and just enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"This is a bar, not a practice range per se. They don't let you use your own drivers, woods, and won't let you take your golf bag with you. I felt really uncomfortable hitting the ball from second floor, feels like you will fall down or drop the club. You have to become a member to practice there, comes with a $5 additional fee. Oh, they also take your phone number (mandatory), and start sending ads via sms. 
Bunch of rules, policies etc."}
{"text":"I had a bad customer service expensive at first and wrote in with a compliant. The director of operations by far fixed it for us. We played golf for 2 hours, the food was great, the service was friendly and fast. It's not a cheap date but a much better date than dinner & a movie!"}
{"text":"We went here for my husband's 50th birthday party on a Saturday afternoon. We picked this place because my husband loves golf, and my SIL had gone to a Top Golf for a corporate event, and had had a great time. We paid $151 for 3 hours and 7 membership cards), plus another $95 for food/drinks.

We were a party of 7 initially, growing to 10 by the time stragglers arrived. We had an issue in signing up where the printer died, and I had to wait while they got me all the membership cards, etc. What I didn't realize was that even though I had waited in line and paid, I was not yet on the waiting list for a bay. Getting on the wait list happens in a second line at the Concierge Desk. I was pretty upset when I found out that multiple groups who had come in after me who had not gotten stuck with a nonworking printer had now gone over and signed up for bays ahead of me. (I was frustrated that the front desk agent didn't suggest I go over and sign up and then come back to get the remainder of the cards.) 

It was my husband's party and I wanted it to be perfect, so I over-reacted just the slightest bit. I asked for a manger. Kudos to them, they handled my over-reaction very professionally and diplomatically. I felt embarrassed afterwards (sorry, guys!), but my husband had a wonderful time, didn't think about all the many pressures in his life once during the entire visit, and I am very grateful for how they handled the situation. 

We had a bay for 3 hours ($35/hour). And I will say the 3 hours flew by! Six people can play at one bay at a time, but you can remove/add players at any time. In my opinion, a single bay can really only accommodate 7-8 people with any comfort (max 4 on the couch, 3 at the high top table behind the couch, and 1 player). So if you have more, you probably want two bays. We were lucky enough not to have anybody else in the bay next to us, and, of course, we spilled over to their area.

They have different games you can play by hitting the ball into targets in the range. We weren't serious gamers/golfers (well, except for my husband and his father!) and just had fun hitting the ball. From a total experience perspective, the evening is probably the better time to go because the targets are lit up. But I think the the daytime is a little more low key (less crowded, less wait time). As many have said before, they don't allow drivers or hybrids currently because some players have put balls in the neighboring parking lot. Hopefully they will fix this soon, but you can still have fun without those clubs. They do allow you to bring/use your own irons.

Our event administrator was excellent (Christine). We brought in a birthday cake, which I was afraid would be an issue (bringing in outside food), but nothing was said (thank you!). And we certainly ordered enough drinks and food to make a good tab. 

They have some kinks to work out yet in their processes (like being sensitive to people not wanting to wait longer than they absolutely have to!). But I would recommend this place for a fun party for anybody whether they play golf or not. Maybe a little more fun for the golfer, but nongolfers can certainly enjoy cheering and heckling (did I just reveal something about my family?). My husband and I talked about how much fun this place would be with some of the golfers we play with, so I think we'll be back (either here or one of the other sites they are in process of opening).

The one thing that was a little frustrating was understanding the scoring system. Sometimes a shot that hit the target didn't register at all, sometimes the same shot would have different scores. (This was mainly a problem for the competitive and analytical among us!) Personally, I think this problem is solved with just a little more alcohol!"}
{"text":"Went tonight with a party of 4 kids and 4 adults. Service was great start to finish, prices were totally fair, and the food was surprisingly good. Special thanks to employee, Bryant. He was so polite and helpful (especially when my son spilled an entire glass of water everywhere). I can guarantee we will be back regularly. Might have to plan an adult party or two ;)"}
{"text":"We had a lot of fun. We went with a party of 8 adults and got there around 5:45. When we first got there, there was some confusion and we were not only switched 3 times but then we had to switch \"lanes\" one more time after our final spot was not working. Would have given less stars if a manager hadn't come to us and given us an extra hour. We each ordered a couple of appetizers and they were all good. My favorite was the pickle fries and even the macaroni and cheese fried with bacon was good. We had a good time. The only thing I would tell someone going is that it might be worth a wait to go higher up. The holes light up and night and it might be part of the fun to be able to see them better. (But not sure it's worth a 3 hour wait which is what we hear it is sometimes.)"}
{"text":"I recently attended a team building event for our Las Vegas team at top golf. We had a blast learning about the different clubs, hitting and golfing. The food was surprisingly good for this type of venue. Service was fast and attentive. I would suggest this location for large groups. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was the heat, it was 102 and very uncomfortable. The staff told us they couldn't turn on the misters unless it was 105!!! Wth! Drinks are overpriced for sure! Be prepared to break open your wallet!"}
{"text":"It was a fun time with friends.  The food was good and drinks were awesome. I dislike only having tall chairs to sit on because I have short legs and like to touch the ground."}
{"text":"Was the worst experience because it simply lacked fun. I came here for my birthday and the host didn't explain the game, and then began to charge us for nothing more than a grass mat driving range.The computer system was archaic, and the sensors were subpar. It was the biggest waste of money I have ever spent in my life. I will never ever do this again. Please save yourself a trip. This should be renamed bottom golf. I left irate. Furthermore I signed up as a member and was double charged. Avoid at all costs!!!!!!!!!!! (I play golf 3 days a week; my handicap is 10) I simply want my money back. Member: Gilbert Butler. Disgusting operation."}
{"text":"Went to Top Golf this weekend with some friends wanting to check out a new fun place. We were not disappointed at all! No, the parking is not super convenient, however, some walking when on the strip should be expected, and it IS Vegas... it's hot here. When we got there around 930 on a Saturday night we were informed there would be an hour wait for a bay so we put our name in and went to one of the many bars inside the facility. Great service and good drinks. Our bay was ready earlier than 1 hour and once in the bay we had an awesome time! The guy who showed us to our bay was very friendly and knowledgeable and our server was on top of our drink situation the whole 3 hours we were there. We ordered the BBQ platter and the food was delicious and plenty for all 6 of us to share. Let's not forget the main attraction, the golf! So fun competing in the games against everyone and great club options to use. Bonus points locals get 20% off, so for a locals night out definitely 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Food was good but good reservations suck! They had us wait over two hours with different versions of the the wait list! Will not go back!"}
{"text":"This place kinda sucks. Food sucked, tiny portions too. Moscow mule sucked, was really a vodka soda. White whine sangria sucked, was pure white wine only. Ice cream \"Sunday\" sucked, it was scoop of ice cream with syrup on top. Food comes or at weird times, meals came before appetizers. 

Oh and the 3 hour wait to play golf didn't help

Seems to be a hype about this place not sure why

Waiter was great that's about it"}
{"text":"What a good time! Wasn't as pricey as I expected being in Scottsdale. The whole group shares hourly cost. Fun with a group. We had 8 and think it was perfect. I suggest come early, as we left about 730 or so there was a 1.5 hour wait! That might be a bit much. Food was good. Only suggestios are maybe give some guidance of how it all works, we had someone who has been there before but if we didn't might be confusing at first....also at main bar the woman tending wasn't very friendly and slow. But everyone else was so nice, maybe off day! Regardless I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is the best place ever! So much fun for everyone! Doesn't matter your age or skill.  Great place to spend with the kiddos. I'm already planning my return!."}
{"text":"This is my second post since first going to the TG Scottsdale. The first time was on Fathers Day this last June 2104 about 4 days after the grand opening. It was a crazy disorganized day, but not unexpected. On the whole I was pleasantly surprised, given my initial skepticism, that this format would work for a modern driving range. On that first visit my wife had overpaid and TG gave us a credit for a future visit. 

So Labor Day we ventured out again, to sample another TG experience. The checking in process was painful, considering we had a TG issued credit, that no-one could figure out how to enter into their computer system. We were bounced back and forth between check in and concierge, and finally the manger had to use his own override to fix it. So up we went to a third floor bay. It was empty up there, and somewhat of a surprise. The bay would not accept the credit issued and we waited 20mins to get this resolved. 

Then I noted they had no woods or hybrids in the TG rack? Why I thought. Turns out its because most modern golfers now, can clear the far fence and hitting cars in the Talking Stick Casino parking lot. Ok bad design flaw TG . 

So why can't women use some as required and handed back after the session is complete? My wife prefers these clubs and does not have a long range, so she did not enjoy the very limited clubs on offer, which by the way have horrible grips now, after only 3 months. 

I'm confused what Top Golf is trying to be, because if it's families then I'm offended I can't be trusted to behave with a long club or 3 wood while on the other hands perhaps the liquor and beer crowd cannot, hence the long club ban. 

It's already beginning to unravel which is a pity, because it has great potential for both families and millennials looking for a bucket of beers, nachos and to drive some cool shots 250 yards. 

It's meant to be a driving range, so make it one."}
{"text":"I wish there was a Topgolf closer to Jersey. My aunt took me here on vacation for a day of fun. I really did not know what to expect because I am not a golfer at all, and I pretty much hate mini golf (horrible experience as a child). But I was her guest and happy to do whatever... I was just happy being in Arizona, in warm weather, and with my family. 

Prior to getting there, my aunt tried explaining what Topgolf was and I did not get it at all. She said it was bowling for golf at a range... still did not help. However, as soon as I got there it clicked and her explanation was really spot on (sorry aunt T, I thought you were crazy for a sec)! Topgolf is a 3 level outdoor golfing range with outside targets that scores your swings/balls (I apologize, I do not know the proper golf terminology yet). There is a screen (like bowling) you use to track your scores and compete. They have several different games, but we just played the rookie one since we were both new to the idea.

It was a blast and I am really glad I was open-minded and tried. It was a gorgeous day to golf with my aunt and enjoy some beers. Did I mention that have a full kitchen and bar?! Yea... it was pretty awesome. I could only imagine how fun this place would be at night with my friends....!"}
{"text":"This is such a fun place to take the family!
You can rent a booth that can seat 8-10 people but for playing golf only 6 per booth. Very comfortable couches, with heaters on a cold day and AC during summer. 
Prices vary by the time of the day and Day of the week, higher on the weekends and in the evenings. If you walk in on a Sunday morning, there is hardly any wait, can rent a booth for $45/hr that includes all the golf equipment and balls. There is a one time membership fee of $5.
My kids love it here. Food is awesome and service is great too. We celebrated my son's birthday and our server Brian S. was the best! He took care of both our booths, helped our big group with setting up the game, refilled drinks so quick and excellent with food orders. He even got my son complimentary donut holes for his bday which were sooo good!
They also have a kids menu.
Nice drink menu for adults and wine list is great too.
Oh the best part... 20% discount for locals on golf when you show your nevada ID WooHoo!!"}
{"text":"I visited Top Golf recently and had a great time, the service is all around outstanding, the drinks are varied and good. There is parking right between Top Golf and MGM Grand conference center, grab your clubs and walk up the stairs. If your clubs are at home, no worries, they have a nice selection of Callaway right at the hitting bays.
    In addition to golf I saw shuffleboard, ping pong, bean bag toss, two swimming pools, lounge areas, and I lost count of the bars. There are areas for kids and some for adults. There is a private lounge on the top level with two bays. 
    Nice clean place that has something for all......."}
{"text":"So much fun!!! Played for a couple of hours. Everyone was really nice and helpful!! It was my first time to do TopGolf and will definitely do it again!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and my most recent experience wasn't at all that great...

1. When a golf club from the upper floor comes falling unexpectedly onto your putting space (literally landing 2 feet away from my brother) and a worker replies \"Oh, that happens all the time,\" then I want no part in the lack of safety this business provides. The netting that's supposed to catch the clubs have huge holes in them, giving clubs a large chance of falling through.

2. That wasn't my only concern; we had a hard time figuring out how the score board worked and went through 3 different employees until the last one refreshed the computer and started working properly. This took up 15-20 minutes of our playing time, so we were unable to fully play for the amount of time we paid for. We waited an hour half and paid $60 for 1 hour on a Wednesday evening (plus 3 x $5 new memberships), only to rush our game in 40 minutes. Couldn't really see how \"fun\" this experience was.

3. The lady who brought us to our table signed up 3 of our group members (since the other 3 of us already had memberships) without telling them that it would cost an extra $5 for each card. And each of those cards looked used/scratched. Really? If we paid for a new card, why would you give us an old (looking) one? The cards were also made for the people in our group who were just visiting, so they would have no reason to have a membership since they're from out of state and considering what we experienced.

4. And one last minor issue we had was when they called us up for our table, but when we got to our table it was still messy. We had to wait a while longer until another READY table was available to occupy. This is a minor issue, but if you're trying to be TOPgolf, you should be on TOP of your game. No one wants to wait an hour and then another half hour due to simple miscommunication. That's unprofessional and again, a waste of time.

I hate leaving my reviews with all cons, so here's the pro's I found:
The inside vibes are fun fun fun. Good upbeat music, large TVs to watch some sports while you wait, couches/tables to eat some food(prices are in between cheap and expensive) or drink some drinks, clean facility, and fairly large sized putting area/table space for your group of 6. The food is subpar and drinks are also okay.  

To be quite honest, top golf would be a nice place to hang out with your group of friends. But for my last visit, I definitely would not be coming back anytime soon if it weren't for all my reasons listed above. However, if I do come back, I hope I can update this review seeing the businesses' full potential."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for something like this my entire adult life. 

Drinks. Golf. Gamification. Music. Culture. 

This place has it all. The food is very good, if not stellar. They've done an amazing job defining a menu that's both eclectic and modern. The corporate Chef really knows his/her stuff. Pricing is right in line. 

Now, for the golf. Handicappers on all levels have dreamed of a place like this. Grab a beer, an iron of your choosing and let the games begin. Pinpoint tracking of your ball down to the foot and inventive games preprogrammed for quick play. 

Looking forward to joining in their tournaments throughout the year. 

This place is 5 stars without hesitation."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and great fun for the whole family!  Everyone was helpful and friendly!  Food was fresh and very tasty!  Our kids had a blast and we will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Always a great time here. Drinks and food are great. Service is just a little lacking, took way too long just for an appetizer. All together great place & good fun."}
{"text":"Tess J is absolutely amazing in every way. She was so kind, caring and attentive to our table all night making it a great experience. If you are able to get Tess as your server, consider yourself lucky!"}
{"text":"I coordinated an event here for my company and although the golfing was fun and interactive the food was not good. Our food was catered, so we didn't individually order off the menu. I'm not sure if that would make a difference but our food was pretty dry. We had sliders, chicken strips, queso cheese dip, chicken patties, chips...in other words happy hour food. But majority of the group wasn't pleased with the quality. One thing that stuck out was how aged the lettuce and tomatoes looked, as if they had been sitting out for a while. Therefore I'm giving this place 3 stars for the entertainment."}
{"text":"Someone from upper management did reach out to me after my post here and to me that does count for something on behalf of an establishment.  The gentleman was very polite and 'heard' my point.  He seemed unwilling, but not unable to see my point and how the way they handle people trying to enjoy their facility could have been accomplished more effectively.  Though he was very friendly and seemed interested in resolving the issue, no options were offered (Like when Donald Trump speaks about Condoleezza Rice).  On quite a few occasions he mentioned that he was new to the issue and was not abreast of all the facts.  This is customer service in America today, \"I understand you are unhappy but there is nothing I will do about it but invite you back for another dose of what I hope is better the next time.\"  The only way I would go into anything unprepared is if I was willing to concede or if I knew I had no intention of changing my position regardless of the truth.  I am still not familiar with the unorthodox management or service at TopGolf."}
{"text":"Super awful at understanding or caring at all about Celiac Disease.  I know being new in Vegas makes you popular but long term you need the locals.  I spoke to two managers about poisoning us with gluten and both gave insincere apologies and promises to do better.  Good luck if you need gluten free stick with the wine!"}
{"text":"We had such an amazing time, the beer was fantastic as well as the food. The service team was very knowledgeable and our server was excellent. We will definitely be back and with a bigger group!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give a good review...but we never got to experience TopGolf. Showed up...reserved 2 bays on the 3rd level. We were told the wait was 45 minutes to an hour.....2 hours 15 minutes  later we were all still standing around....waiting. Probably heard \"10 more minutes\" eight times. I don't mind waiting, but give an decent estimation. Its unfortunate, as locals we probably won't return. Warm beer glasses, high ATM fees, overpriced gimmick."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for family and working on your game with ample time to be social. Fun times, good food and Lucas our server and coach was fabulous!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Unique experience for anyone whether it's date night, night out with friends or even if you are bringing the kids for family time.  The food was delicious.  The sea bass sliders were on point!  And every employee We encountered were friendly, enthusiastic and helpful from the moment we walked in until we left. Definitely will be back again!"}
{"text":"Went here a few months ago for first time for work event and it was awesome. Defiantly nothing like a regular driving range at a golf course. Awesome atmosphere and great music playing. Will be going back for sure. Highly recommended even if you don't know how to golf or never really golf no matter how bad you think you may be you'll have a blast. **Note- you don't need to take golf clubs they will provide for you, lefty or righty they have both. If you take your own you can only take irons. Can't take your own drivers or hybrids, which was a little bummer but guess you have to keep playing field even I suppose. Still give five stars for sure"}
{"text":"I came here invited and didn't know what to expect, but I couldn't been more surprised. So relaxed with waiting service, a driving range with the casualty of a bowling alley. The fact that you can play games against the rest of your party makes golf a whole other beast - very nice. 

I had way more fun than I bargained for and I will definitely return. I like the concept and how well they put it together. And the fact that it was 100+ degrees in the middle of the day, and they still managed to make it comfortable for everybody. I can see this taking off. For sure.

I will be back. Soon. Maybe bringing my own clubs. 
(Note to self: Acquire clubs)"}
{"text":"Party of 8, and an awesome time. Our host, Luke Lourie, was fantastic! He gave us tips for our golf swing, recommended food, and took photos with 4 different cameras. He even tuned in the Bronco game for us!! We really had such a great time, and Luke was instrumental in that. You have a great employee!! Can't wait come back again. All the food was good too, and bloody Mary's were awesome!"}
{"text":"One of the servers was very rude she looks like a guy and has blond hair. When ordering she kept interrupting and saying what she would order. After finishing my food, one of the bussed boys tried to take my vape juice which luckily I caught because it was a $50 bottle."}
{"text":"This is just such a fun, fantastic thing to do with family and friends, regardless of if you have never swung a club or are an aspiring Dustin Johnson.

The music, atmosphere, the attentive staff, all top notch at TopGolf.

We were a party of 10 that grew to 14 that ultimately grew to 18 before it was done.  In town for Thanksgiving we had Forbes and Family we all wanted to see and have some entertainment for, half of he party being kids.  Unfortunately I called a day after they had stopped taking party requests but Erica was super helpful on the phone hiding me as to when to call and what to do.  When we arrived, Chris took over and got us what we needed.  The wait was long...remember it was day after Thanksgiving now...so we put our name in, and went to Flo's for Chinese and came back 2 hours later.  Viola...big party leaving...our big party gets the big bays.  Could not have worked any better!

Our server was awesome... can't believe I did not get his name.  

Thanks for great family and friend memories this holiday, Top Golf!"}
{"text":"Great place if you want to hit some balls.  I am not the best but had lots of fun and the drinks are good too."}
{"text":"Normally I'd rate this place very high, but the ball tracking system is complete garbage the last 4 trips here. At least 50% of the really good shots (close to pin, back stop) never count despite us watching the ball clearly land well within range of points.

Hard to want to come back..."}
{"text":"Topgolf takes everything good and great about every driving range you've ever been to, puts it all together and serves it up in a sleek, modern package.  The place has style and I would not be surprised if it catches on in other locations besides Las Vegas. 

Whether you come for a quick lunch break or stay for an afternoon, there's everything you could need all in one place.  Full bar? Check. Attractive waitresses and good service? Check. Clubs right at the tee? Check.  Automatic ball dispenser? Check.  Electronic tracking of score? Check. It's pretty much the peak of modern golfing technology catering to the customer.

I'm not an avid golfer and don't get the chance to play all that much, so there might be some points I've missed that more serious types might notice. All I know is that I had a really good time for a couple of hours that passed by very quickly. 

Basically there are three levels of the driving range with the third floor being the top. The third floor not only gives you the best view of the course and the targets, but also the best driving angle so your drives go that much farther. It cost a little bit more to be on the top floor, but I would say that it's worth it.

As mentioned above they have a digital tracking system kind of like bowling but a bit newer and more high-tech. It keeps track of how many balls each person gets through the automatic dispenser, which is activated when you wave the golf club over the sensor. Once it automatically spits out a ball, the system tracks and registers where you hit the ball on the course.

If you haven't been to Topgolf, they have a \"game\" of sorts where you can attempt to aim for different areas on the driving range to score points. The farther ones being worth more points, and consecutive hits in targets doubling your score.  It makes for a fun competition when you aren't golfing alone. Thanks to the electronic tracking system if you are with a group of friends you can have a good time without having to worry about keeping track of points.  There are also several varieties different games you can play including total points scored or more skill specific games where you aim for certain targets.

Overall Topgolf is a real hit in my opinion and is definitely worth checking out if you like to visit driving ranges or just want to have a good time in a different way."}
{"text":"Well, we're probably not your typical clientele.   An Uncle and his 13 year old nephew.  We're from North Phoenix, not dressed right, not golfers, certainly not there for drinking at 8 AM on a Saturday.  Only reason I'm there is from sharing the wealth after winning at poker from the Talking Stick (a stones throw away) the week before.  And from the moment we walked up, we get the Scottsdale stuffy that I half expected.   \"What up?\" from the front desk guy, not a \"Hi, can I help you?\".   A manager looking lady gives my nephew some vague warning about how he can't bring his Dad's club up to the range, as if he's a threat of some kind.   \"You'll have to walk that back to the car, sonny.\"   Then, after doubling back, We get the brief instruction on the electronic scoresheet as almost an afterthought - didn't tell us how to switch players or even how to get the next ball out of the machine.

But the waitress Kaylan shows up, drops off our water (sorry, but no alcohol for you, young fella, she says).   And then when she sees that we are total hackers, she goes ahead and offers, \"would you guys like any tips?\"   \"Sure\".  \"Well you might start with the men's club rather than the women's....\" And goes on to correct the nephew's stiff swing, slows down my rushed approach and in short improved both of our games by 100%.  She goes on to check in on us every 15 minutes to see how we are progressing, giving my nephew a confidence surge with each correction and by the end of the day, the \"kid\" is during 160-180 yards with semi-consistency.   Obviously, Kaylan went out of her way, where any normal waitress would've said \" well, won't be getting any tips here\" and instead saw us as the eager-to-learn beginners that we really were.  Kaylan's made this spot visit worth every minute."}
{"text":"Great spot for some daytime or evening fun. Let loose, hit some balls, improve your golf game, or just relax and unwind.

Arcade style makes Golf more enjoyable and keep it fresh with different games. I love the food and drink aspect of it and then they have an awesome area for kids too. 

Holy chicken and waffles this place is amazing, seriously genius idea and vision brought to life."}
{"text":"Topgolf is easily the perfect place to have a great time with friends or family, for celebrations or just a day out! We visited yesterday to celebrate our dear friends birthday. We were greeted with smiling faces and welcoming staff. Our server (really wish we remembered her name) was lovely, consistently refilling drinks and having fun making conversation. We ordered the cheese dip, wings, and flat breads. ALL THREE ARE A MUST. If you are looking for a great deal on beer, their buckets are a amazing! Personally, I had the Topgolf Tea and the Tipsy Palmer. So refreshing on a hot day. The actual concept of Topgolf is so fun, you don't have to be good at golf to have an awesome time. We finished our night with a hospitality guest service manager, Michelle! She was professional and friendly, and we will definitely be back to see her. Great energy and just so excited about her job and the company she works for! Overall, can't get much better than Topgolf!"}
{"text":"Other than waiting 2 and 1/2 hours on a Saturday evening for a bay, we loved this place. 

We came prepared for a wait and decided we'd have dinner in the restaurant to pass the time. It took about 15 minutes to be greeted initially and the service was a bit slow after that, but the food was pretty good. The burgers and \"mushi\" (Mexican \"sushi\" roll) were delicious. 

Once we were done eating, I went to the concierge desk to inquire how much longer it would be to golf and they told me we were next in line. Perfect timing! So I sat back down and waited for a text. And waited. And waited. Half hour later I wait in the concierge line again only to be told there must've been a \"glitch\" in their computer system, that they had texted me but gave away our bay to the next person in line. I still haven't received that text yet. Lol! The manager on duty saw how frustrated I was becoming as this was my birthday celebration and our party was becoming impatient...so he promised us the next open bay. A little while later, we ended up on the 3rd floor and it was a great time from that point on. Our server was attentive, the band was awesome, the drinks were flowing, and everyone was having fun until the bill arrived (gulp!)

While the kids would love to come here every week, that's not going to happen. We'll definitely be back, just never again on a Saturday ;)"}
{"text":"Seems like a nice place if you are looking for a drink and a lite meal. The morning burger that I had was very good.  Took a few minutes to be served but once served, the service was good.  Bottom line is I would go back."}
{"text":"Whether you're a complete newbie or a seasoned golfer, TopGolf is a ton of fun.  

THE SETUP: 
TopGolf is basically a three-level driving range with a variety of targets and with big screens (like the size they have at a large arena or stadium) showing sports on the far side.  Each bay has an l-shaped seating area, a table, TVs coordinated to track your drives, and the actual golfing area which has an automatic ball machine and a full set of clubs (lefty clubs are available by request).  Each pair of bays face each other. 
 As each bay accommodates 6 golfers, groups of up to 12 can use two side-by-side bays.  

PRICING:
The golfing is actually pretty inexpensive.  If you go midweek and before noon, you can get a bay for as cheap as $30/hour (plus a $5 member fee for each person).  Friday/Saturday nights can go for as much as $90/hour.  You can find discount vouchers from the booth in the lobby of the MGM, and don't need to do full hour increments (we ended up golfing for an hour and a half).  

FOOD/DRINK: 
Food and drink are really the way TopGolf makes its money.  Beers start at $7 each and bottle service starts at $300.  The best values are getting Beer for the Bay ($24 beers for $150) and getting shareable platters rather than individual dishes.  Our group came for breakfast/brunch and shared the street taco platter ($75) and the fruit platter ($65).  The food was much fresher and better than expected especially the carnitas tacos, and came with grilled onions, chips, salsa, pickled vegetables, peppers, and guacamole.  I also enjoyed the manmosa (Blue Moon, prosecco, and OJ) for $10.  You can spend a ton of money here but you don't have to."}
{"text":"I was at the main bar tonight and waited 30 minutes to even be acknowledged, then took 5 bartenders to scan my id and charge my card. After that, i waited another 25-30 minutes to order food. If it weren't for the barnacle, Tyler, I would have left and probably wouldn't come back. I noticed many people have to wait anywhere between 10-30 minutes to even be noticed. This is unacceptable and unprofessional. Thank goodness for Tyler!"}
{"text":"Even though I haven't golfed before, and I found out that I ain't cut out to \"drive the ball\" either, it was honestly fun. 
I have to attribute it to the friendly hosts that check patrons in and the wait staff at/for the bays. The hostesses at the check-in counter gave us the run-down on how it works (e.g. letting us know to let the wait staff know to apply the locals discount). The actually hostess that registered all the players and how their system works was also pretty nice. Wait staff was awesome and friendly like everyone else - checked on us multiple times during the game. 
Food was also yummy. The family enjoyed the shrimp and garlic flatbread. 
Only criticism has got to be us being confused and not given any direction/checked on by anyone when we were trying to just order food/drinks before being sent to our bay. 
I think I spent around $190 for our group of 7 in 1 bay for a 1 hour game. The breakdown of it was paying for first-time registry of all the players, a locals discount for the bay/hour game, 3 plates of food (shrimp, edamame and flatbread) and 2-4 alcoholic drinks. 
The family enjoyed it quite a bit to want to go back and improve, but we'd make adjustments like request 2 bays for a whole group of us - it was kinda tightly spaced, especially when we ordered food and drinks. Plus it's hard to completely finish a game without feeling rushed for a group of 7."}
{"text":"One of my favorite activities in the Phoenix area. A good place to hang out with friends and eat as well. The food here is actually better than I was expecting too. A good time for beginners as well as advanced golfers."}
{"text":"I went to TopGolf last night and was impressed! When you first walk in, you check in and tell them how many people you have and how long you'd like to golf. Next, you're taken to your area and you get a membership card ($5) which is required to play but it's a lifetime membership. After entering your name on the computer, you can start playing! 

Your area consists of a couch, table, TV and many golf clubs. Our waiter came over right away and asked if we wanted drinks. I ordered a drink in a souvenir glass. ($20) We had dinner before, so we didn't order anything to eat but the food smelled really good!

For an hour of golfing and a souvenir glass, our total was $90. (Thursday evening) The prices depend on the day of the week and the time of day. I think this is a great place to go with a group!"}
{"text":"I should mention that I didn't actually do any golfing activities because it was 110 degrees and golf is lame, but I was there to supervise a graduation party for little kids while drinking several beers and eating delicious chips, salsa and guac.

This place is HUGE. There is a main bar where you can watch all the sports your heart desires, or watch people walk in with khakis and square shaped polos with checkmarks on them. Either way you'll enjoy yourself.

The best part about this place is the fact that there are rooms everywhere for entertainment, including Xbox on massive TV's. If you get tired of one area, you are going to find another comfortable place.

Great for kids, great for adults looking to pretend to be pro golfers, and great for happy hours. I kind of like this place!"}
{"text":"Well I had a blast and learned I should be a professional golfer.  =)  The fact that we all had drink coupons certainly didn't hurt my rating.  I would definitely come back here or go to any other Topgolf place.  I believe this place catered our food which was just ok, but I wouldn't not come here because of the food if you know what I mean.  It was a great time!"}
{"text":"I really like Top Golf and have gone several times in Houston.
We showed up with a group of four on a Saturday night, and had to wait about an hour and 45 minutes for a spot.  

This place is packed on Saturday nights!
I would have loved to go when it was less busy.
It's most expensive to go when we went (which I didn't know as I've only ever gone during the week) $90/hour, but split four ways isn't bad, and you can have up to I think 10 per space.

The drink prices are great compared to other places and the food selection is good too.
It's so clean and well taken care of I would recommend this over a lot of places in Vegas, especially since it has food and drinks.  I suck at gold and still enjoy coming here.

It's also worth noting that smoking ins't allowed inside which is a nice change of pace from the rest of Vegas.

Bring a group, show up early, plan to hang for a few hours, and you'll have a blast.
They have four levels and some huge screen TVs plus corn hole!

They also have a nice pool inside with glass walls which would be fun to hang at mid-day between golfing and eating.  I'm going back in a few weeks and will visit here again for sure."}
{"text":"Games can be a little confusing with multiple players due to the fact that you need to change the players manually as opposed to an auto switch (such as bowling) which would be a lot more manageable, also having an area for larger groups would be a big improvement. The majority of us needed to stand and there were no room for the food and drinks on the table, thankfully the staff were prompt and checked on is frequently to clear the area. All in all, cool atmosphere and different, I would do it again!"}
{"text":"Dont waste your time or money if you are actually looking to practice your swing.   You cant use any drivers, woods or hybrid irons unless you are in the bottom floor. However, you can use their drivers, woods, etc... on any floor. When we inquired as to the reason, we received some unclear confusing response. Apparently the nets can be damaged if you hit from a 2nd or 3rd floor vs the 1st floor. Obviously people generate more club head speed which in turn causes the ball to travel faster when you are 12 feet or 24 feet higher than the ground floor (sarcasm).

This place is more like a version of dave and busters mixed with hooters. The process to even get to the point of hitting a ball is ridiculous. Stand in line for a membership (cost money), then go to the concierge and get assigned to a bay, then work through a computer system to get the balls to eventually dispense.

We asked for a refund and received some push back in the form of attitude from Christopher K. He then tried to only refund us for the time we purchased for hitting balls, instead of the whole purchase of membership fees and play time.  During this time he made snide remarks to other employees about my family and I.  I didn't realize that asking for a refund after being mislead about a product or service constituted the added need of being a jerk. Great way to ensure people never come back and put the word out to avoid this business."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked into this establishment this place was a complete disaster. First of all, as soon as my family and I got into line the \"employee's\" were talking, laughing, gossiping- what have you. Until THEY were done talking and taking care of their conversations they let us wait in line until they decided to, \"hi I can help you.\" So, the gentlemen checking us in told us there was an hour wait for level 2, longer wait for level 3 and level 1 was only a 15 minute wait. So of course we took the 15 minute wait. As soon as we got to level 1 we realized we couldn't see the targets so we asked to be put on the waiting list for level 2. BUT we also asked if we can stay at level one for the meantime while we wait for the 2nd level to be available. The woman setting us up, very kind and understanding said that was no problem. However, one of the servers overheard the whole conversation and thus did not want to help us order food or drinks at all. We waited at our bay for 15-20 minutes to get a server to help us. The only reason why she asked if we wanted to order something was because I had the, \"I need help\" look on my face. So, she helps us but says \"you guys are going to another level right?\" \"ok yeah I can get you drinks.\" basically saying she was only going to order our drinks and not food. Why? Because hello! Little miss attitude wanted the entire tip and knew once we went up to level two she wouldn't get it. So she takes more than 10 minutes to get our drinks, and only brings them out because she overheard we were finally going up to level two. she did not want to help us, basically felt forced and we do not in any way appreciate her attitude and her lack of customer service. Now, we're on the second level and the waitress serving us, Harmony was the most attentive, well being, excellent customer service employee there. she was the only person who came to our bay as soon as we sat down. She visited us very often asking if we needed to order anything else, she brought us utensils, water etc. I appreciate Harmony for her wonderful customer service but I do not appreciate how awful every other employee was during our visit. There was even water on the floor on our first bay and we asked for it to be cleaned up because hello!!! Nobody wants to slip and fall while playing golf, and the girl downstairs assured us she'd call someone to clean it up, but no one ever came. Shocker. This business really needs to get it together because yes, I understand it is a fun job and everyone is having a good time but it's a job and they need to be a little bit more professional."}
{"text":"This is my first time here- our flight was delayed so we came for a quick bite to eat and decided to enjoy a golf game to ease some stress. We did the first level because the wait wasn't as long as the higher levels. We had a great time and the nachos were SO GOOD! We also did the craft mimosas which were $24 and gave us about 6 glasses total.
This is a great place for a date night, celebration with a group or just a random walk-in. I would definitely recommend Topgolf"}
{"text":"Cool place, but pretty expensive if you compare it to a regular range. Three of us spent $240 for one bay for 2 hours. To put it in perspective, you could get 2,000 golf balls + two cases of beer for the same price at a regular range.

Guess it didn't help that my friend ordered a bottle of pinot noir, which was unnecessary and also the classiest thing any of us did that week.

Seems like a fun place for a date, or for 3 dudes to share a bottle of pinot wine.

Good people working there."}
{"text":"This is my second time to a Top Golf, my first being at the location in Tampa Bay. We walked in and were quoted a 4 hour wait time. We were like WHAAAAAAT? We decided to put our names down and then just eat dinner at the bar and see if the wait lets up.

We sat our selves in the open sitting area and waiting a good 15 minutes before we were greeted by a server. I know this place is a busy place, but I feel like the wait times were really long.

We kept asking our server for our drinks and the appetizer and he said \"look around we are really busy right now, the kitchen is really backed up, it'll be out as soon as it's done\". I was like okayyyyy. Then we asked if we can order our main food then. 30 minutes later our main food came out and still no appetizers. When we asked the server for it he said that he didn't have any idea why it wasn't out yet. Come to find out that he never put them in, so the appetizers ended up coming out while we were midway through our meal. This me totally ranting so here is the stuff you guys want to know:

We ordered the steak plate, there were 5 of us.
- really good kabobs definitely was enough food for us. We have 3 girls and 2 boys. My favorite was the chicken with tzaiki sauce and the pita brea

We got the tater tots, salt and vinegar chips and the smoked wings.
- tater tots and wings were delicious
- salt and vinegar chips were super crispy we just wished we tasted more of the vinegar

While we were paying for dinner we got a text to let us know our bay is open. The service at our Top Golf bay was way better than at the bar. 

We ordered the injectable donuts and they were AMAZING.

I would recommend coming here. Just expect a long wait. It's a great place for avid and beginner golfers. It's more a huge arcade game."}
{"text":"Normally I love this place but holy cow the bartender on the third floor was so rude. I can't count how many times she was so disrespectful, rolled her eyes and blamed things/ put all the work on the server. Hopefully this improves because we do many company gatherings here but I won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"Topgolf was so fun! We had a group of 6 and I would maybe consider signing up for more than just an hour with a group that large.  We barely had time to finish our game, but really liked the experience.

The drinks were priced well, especially for being in Vegas, and then view was awesome.  All of the staff was very friendly, but I do think they forgot about us.  They stopped coming over when we had about 20 minutes left. When the game was over, it told us to wait for our server to give us the bill, but no one ever came back.  Eventually they brought another group up to take our spot, but we hadn't even gotten to pay yet.  I think it was just a little miscommunication, but we felt weird about it nonetheless.

I would recommend doing this if you have a few night, or are looking for something to do before going out!  I just found out that they are putting one in near Pittsburgh, and I would like to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, even for non golfers!
I'm not a golfer myself, but I have had the best time here with my friends.
Food is great and drinks are inexpensive!
Been here day and night - at night everything lights up and makes it even more awesome.

The only thing that annoyed me was the fans. I felt like I was in a never ending tornado, but eventually got the fan turned off, thank God.
only $45/hour."}
{"text":"Overall we really enjoyed ourselves.  Both of our kids golf, and they thought it was great fun. Just a couple of complaints.  It was super hot here. Although there is air-conditioning in the bar, the hitting bay's are not air-conditioned.  Definitely consider waiting until the heat wave passes. Also there isn't any description of the different games you can play except on the computer.  We wasted some of our time reading them, and at up to $90/hour, time is money people! It would be nice if they had a printed card or brochure to look at while the other golfers are hitting.  We played their top golf signature game and the chipping game. The second one focuses on just the closest targets so it eliminates the advantage a long hitter has. Finally, it turns out I'm afraid of golfing from heights. My balance was really off since I kept leaning away from the edge. I'd take a first floor bay next time!  I'm sure we'll be back. My daughter wants to make it a regular stop for our family Vegas visits."}
{"text":"Cool place.  Food is pretty darn good, as well.  I'll definitely be back and I plan on using this as a place to host business meetings."}
{"text":"Topgolf is one of the best ideas I have ever heard . It's a driving range/bar .

The driving range is not your typical driving range . It's three stories high with each group having your own lane and clubs. Wish they had a better selection of clubs though. Their is a couple of games you can play with the group from competitive to just having a great time . All levels of play can go and succeed at the games . 

The bar is really packed on the weekends and tough to get a drink but once you get on your lane which can sometimes be a hours long wait you have you own personal bar tender which is awesome . 

I definitely recommend going to top golf. The only reason I give it  4 stars is because of the slow bar service and the amount of choices for clubs is slim"}
{"text":"We visited Topgolf a few days ago as a party of 4 kids (8-11yrs old) and 4 adults. While we probably should have registered and made a reservation ahead of time, the staff were not flustered, they worked quickly, joyfully and efficiently. The staff engaged the kids, walked them through the safety, the computer and game play. We were swinging clubs within 15 minutes of coming through the door on a pretty busy night, which was in itself impressive. 
The server was very attentive to the adults and kids. The music, beverages and food etc. were perfect for our families. The staff were hungry to please and make sure our needs were met. We left feeling like this is a place we would want to bring our kids every time we are in Scottsdale even for a snack and some refreshments. Our kids were talking about it on the plane ride home. 
The impeccable service didn't end there. When we got home to Canada we realized that one of our kids left their own club in a rental set that night. Naturally we were upset and being 2500 km away we were not hopeful. We sent an email to Topgolf and within 24 hrs the Director of Instruction, Jesse Hughes PGA, called me to say he had our club and he wanted to make sure we got it back. His concern for my child being without her club was palpable on the phone and as I type the club is on its way back to me courtesy of Topgolf. 
It is clear to me that Topgolf has great culture, they hire talented individuals and place a premium on the client experience. Thank you Jesse and team, your service has left a lasting impression on us and we cannot wait to come back and say thanks in person. 
On a final note, golf needs more champions like Jesse and his team to grow the game, this was a \"home-run\" for Topgolf and for the game of golf."}
{"text":"Service was bad the waiters failed to do the job they are paid to do. Quite sad I hope next time they can help fill my drink and serve the food I pay for instead of talking to their boyfriends. That would be amazing if they did."}
{"text":"While we have had great service before tonight was different. Was not packed at the bar but took 30 minutes to get a server after asking multiple times. Bartender had some smart ass comments about my party getting our credit card back."}
{"text":"This is the new joint that opened up in Vegas.  Came here with a few colleagues after CES and we got a booth.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers, drinks, and a few rounds of golf.  It's a golfing range so you just swing into the lit up colored zones.  I have never swung a golf club before so this was an interesting experience.  Made me realize that there is a lot more technique to golf than just swinging the stick.  The booth tallied our points depending on which zone you land in and gives you points.  It was windy that night, but they had a heating system right above the booth that helped with that.  The only annoying thing would probably be the booth chairs that we sat in.  It kept sliding apart because people would be getting up and sitting down a lot which shifted the chairs and creating a gap so you would have to keep pushing it together.  If they had like a long chair instead of a bunch of smaller chairs put together to make a long chair that would probably solve that issue."}
{"text":"Such a great alternative to a bar! Being active or just hanging out people watching. Love this place, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Most horrible parking but golf setup is amazingggggg! Enjoy ever bit of that! Excellent time!!!"}
{"text":"A Must for all those looking to have a great time eating, drinking and taking out some frustrations hitting golf balls.  Great experience for everyone no matter what your age or golf skills may be.  Overall Great Food, Full Bar (Build your own Bloody Mary Bar) and 3 tiers of fun.  Even if you have no desire to swing a club, I recommend giving it a try!  Only complaint would have to be staying away during the summer heat because the misters are useless and at night you are going to pay $45/hr for each bay. See You Soon!"}
{"text":"This place is truly something else. If they had one of these in San Diego I would pursuit playing full time haha. Pay per hour golf at a reasonable price as long as with you're a few buddies. Full service food and drinks at your bay(range mat). Clubs included. Balls unlimited. Huge tv screens. Sports book available! What a man cave!!! Our server, I think her name was Michelle, was absolutely fantastic, I had to write a note saying how great she was on the receipt. She checked in every 10 minutes it felt like. We got appetizer wings and tots and she did a great job inputting how she felt about what was on the menu. Both were fantastic tasting. We had two friends who didn't golf agreeing it'd be dangerously fun if we had one of these in San Diego. It truly makes golf a fun sport just like how bowling is. Nothing but good things I had to say about this place."}
{"text":"Place is nice and you have An amazing view of Vegas. Make sure to get seated on the 2nd floor, the first is not fun haha. I had to make a reservation twice because they out me on the first and then the second later. Wait is about an hour on weekend nights."}
{"text":"I'll have to say as a first time visit here this place was great the food was good and the service from the staff was great the options of games to play on a driving range were awesome definitely not a boring night will definitely go again"}
{"text":"Every time I go there I get hassled about my clubs. I don't know who can reach the back targets with their senior flex clubs. I personally have to hit my 5 wood to get to the black target. The time after my wife brought her clubs and has only golfed three times and might hit a ball 100 yards. I had to put back 5 hybrids and 3 woods. More recently while waiting I noticed many people were not allowed to bring their own clubs in or bottles of water. I personally don't bring my clubs anymore. All these new rules are being put in because someone did something stupid while ruining the experience for the rest of us.

The front entryway is incredibly small and most people have no idea where to go when they get in there. The card desk and the bay reservation desk need to be together or automated like a movie theater to speed things up. If you go there any time after 5pm, you will be hard pressed to find a parking spot and have about a 2 hour wait unless you have a VIP card. Good luck! This place has plenty of potential but they surely aren't using it."}
{"text":"I've been to top golf twice now and it's really such a fun and different experience. They have music, live entertainment, two pools, drinks, food, golfing, areas for lounging, and games like shuffle board. The atmosphere is fun, lively, and upscale. It has a beautiful view at night.

I do not know how to golf so my experience was hysterical trying to learn. The pricing is quite high per hour, however you may have 6 people golfing at a time so if you split the price it's pretty reasonable. Your bay host will register each player and teach you how to play different games offered on their system. You get points for making your ball in certain holes so it can get competitive if your group is decent at golfing. 

I think it's a great alternative to a nightclub. It has the atmosphere on the 3rd floor where it's 21 and up, but it isn't as loud and pricey as a nightclub. You can still order bottle service there in the bays. 

The only two cons about top golf would be that the wait can be very long when they are busy and the check in area is a bit disorganized getting parties to the correct bays.

Overall, a very fun and unique experience outside the typical Las Vegas strip activities."}
{"text":"Touchdown!? Errr... I have zero love for the actual game of golf, but get me in a driving range and I'm having a blast. Topgolf is truly the ultimate driving range with multiple targets within the range that capture your yardage and speed. 

4 levels high, this massive play house is balls of fun! You enter on the second level where you check-in. We got super lucky, as I have heard many a horror story about the massive weight times. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND calling ahead. We waited about 10 minutes and then received a text that our golf bay was ready. Prices are per hour and vary by the time you arrive and which level you would like to be on, obviously nighttime and the higher levels are more mula! There is also a one-time $5 per person for a Topgolf Lifetime Membership. I'm in the club, baby!!  The 4th level is a private event space with a private pool. We opted for the 3rd level because YOLO. The 3rd level has a private bar and a pool. This level is cool because it can please a whole crowd, some can be at the pool and some can be at hitting balls-- you can easily go back and forth. Typically the pool on level 3 is $30/person to use, but if you are spending mad money at your table and it isn't CRAZY busy at the pool-- they are pretty cool about letting you in. There is about 6 cabanas surrounding the pool that you can rent, 3 of which \"overlook\" Wet Republic. 

Similar to bowling, your group gets their own \"lane.\" They call it a \"golf bay,\" I like to call it a golf cabana because it sounds fancy. We had 5 people, but I think you could fit 8-10 in a lane. Your golf cabana contains 2 TVs (one with your golf scores + one with sports), a sectional couch, a table, space to put your own clubs, the Topgolf clubs that are offered to you (for men and women), the grass patch with tees and the machine that spits out the balls. A host walked us to the golf cabana and explained the process. They really push the \"No Happy Gilmoring.\" You are then handed off to a server who can get your food and drink orders. I had a frozen Ketle One moscow mule and it was perfection. #STRONG

There are multiple games you can play within the targets on the range. You start by waving your club in front of the ball machine sensor and poof-- your ball. You get 20 balls per person per game. However, you can complete multiple games in an hour. We played for 2 hours and it felt too long. haha But, that might just be me. The screen will tell you how far and fast you hit the ball ONLY if you make it in a target. There are 4 big targets and another 4 small ones. 

I can see the appeal of this place and I enjoyed watching friends who love golf getting excited. However, personally if this was near my house-- it wouldn't be my go-to place. It is expensive and while fun, I think there are better places to have fun for the price. With that being said, it is definitely worth at least one trip. 

The parking/taxi/valet situation can be a shit-show and is something I think still needs to be worked out at this location."}
{"text":"Top golf was a blast! I would definitely recommend going with a group of 4-6, because it costs $40-45 per hour, per pod. You can have up to 6 people per pod. I went with 3 other people and we had a great time. The staff there was really nice and friendly and very accommodating. The food and drinks were great. The atmosphere was awesome too, I mean it can't get better being at a driving range where everyone is drinking and having a good time. The bucket specials are pretty sweet (spent $20 for 6 leinenkugel sunset   wheat). If you go with a group it's easy to split the cost of things. Top gold offers various game options at the driving range that keep players amused. Overall I had a blast here and definitely would recommend this place to friends trying to do something different on the weekend or even during the week."}
{"text":"This is easily the worst customer service experience I have ever had. 

When we arrived, we were told there would be a 45 minute wait for a bay, while waiting for a bay to open up, we ordered food at the bar. After 30 minutes had passed, we got the text that our bay was ready. We let the bartender know which bay we were going to so they could send the food up when it arrived.  After another 20 minutes, we let our server at the bay know the situation to see if she could check on the food. Another 10 minutes go by and we find out that there was a miscommunication somewhere in the process and they need to start a new food order.  After another 30 minutes, the pizza we had ordered well over an hour ago finally arrives, but still no hummus. We let the server know and another 20 minutes pass before the hummus finally arrives. At this point, we didn't feel the need to extend our game so we sat down to finish our hummus...It was at this point, minutes after our game ended and 10 minutes after our hummus finally arrived that we were told we needed to vacate the bay area so they could use it for the next group. We never got a chance to finish our 2 hour hummus.  

On top of all that, when we got to our bay, it was still a mess from the previous group, even though the text told us to come right up. If we got that text when the bay was actually ready, the food may have come before we went upstairs and this whole mess may have been avoided.  

Throughout the whole process, there were many missed opportunities for the staff to resolve this issue. When the bar messed up the order(which I don't even know the name of the bartender because he never introduced himself to us), the next one could have been put to the top of the list instead of making us wait another 30 minutes for half our order to arrive. When the food finally did arrive, I had to go and find utensils and napkins. Our server did offer a manager at one point(we didn't ask, she offered) but never followed through on that. We were offered 15 minutes of comp time, but that didn't happen either. The food couldn't even be comped because we had paid for it at the bar. Someone did come by and ask us about our experience and when we told him and I could  see the panic in his face because he was not trained to handle a negative review and just nervously told us \"Well, I hope next time you come is better\"(wish I had his name, but again he didn't introduce himself to us). There was very little effort made by any of the staff members to do anything to turn our experience around and win us back.

The final straw was when we were forced out of the bay while we were still finishing our 2 hour hummus. When we tried to talk with a manager before leaving, we were told there were no one on site to talk with us and we were given a card to contact Tyson who we were told would be able to resolve the issue. I tried emailing Tyson on 2/16/18 and have yet to receive a reply. On 3/5/18 I tried using the online complain form on the Top Golf website, received an email back letting me know someone would be reaching out to me shortly. Have not heard anything."}
{"text":"I love hitting at Top Golf in Las Vegas. Open till 2am, top floor (3rd) is the best. Great food and bar as well as music. If you love golf I'd highly suggest Top Golf."}
{"text":"Whenever the chance comes up, I'm all in for heading over to Top Golf! My husband and I were particularly excited when this location in Gilbert opened up as its closer to us.

It's a fun time to play the different golfing challenges depending on what we're in the mood for. The set up is similar to bowling; when it's each persons turn, we hit about 5-6 balls at at time so we're not constantly switching between players. I'm not good at golf by any means but I enjoy coming here more than I do going to play mini golf!

Minus one star only because sometimes it's hard to track down the server to order food and get refills on drinks. I totally understand that it's a busy place though, especially on the weekends. Overall, the quality of food is good & it's a fun time; we enjoy Top Golf & will be back!"}
{"text":"Venue: 
Too busy. It was fun once we got a tee, but I'm not sure the 4 hour wait was worth it. We came at 5 p.m. and got a tee at 910 p.m. The extra amenities like pool and shuffle board made the time go by a little quicker. 

Food:
I got a fried chicken sandwich and it was very salty. Like so salty I had to take the breading off. The prices were reasonable and normal which was nice. There is actually a huge drinking crowd that isn't even golfing drinking inside and watching."}
{"text":"Had a really great expereince here and it would easily be 5 stars if the service for food wasn't so horrible! There were 12 of us and several in the group knew that it gets really busy so we arrived early on a Saturday morning and got 2 bays second floor next to eachother just like we wanted. The hostess showed us how to use the computer system and was very friendly. The golf part was a lot of fun and a great activity for a group. 

Now lets get to the food. The food itself was very good. I had the breakfast/brunch pizza and it was awesome. Someone in the group had the loaded fries and they were really good as well. Got a couple drink, some burgers etc and all great food. Service however was not. Our food came before we ever got our drinks or silverware. We had to keep asking and eventually I got up and went in search of silverware myself. We didn't get checked on for a long time to see if we needed anything. It was rather unfortunate because it took away from what a great time we were having golfing and the food was decent so there would have been no complaints. 

I do agree with many people that they really should have some kind of reservation system. but for a group of people looking for a different fun activity this was great. Ended up costing us each $13 ish for the golf and checks were around $20 for lunch. Not bad for something unique."}
{"text":"Interesting concept, expensive though. Something different to do in Vegas. Worth trying once. Service is very slow. Ordered drinks and never got them but had no problem taking my credit card for the tab!! My adult kids liked it though"}
{"text":"It was alright. It definitely was not worth the $45/hour to golf there when we went. Also our waiter Lucky wasn't very attentive and forgot our orders multiple times."}
{"text":"Been to Top Golf so many times at several different locations and this was the best time we've had! Our bay host, Chandler was the reason. He was amazing! He overheard us talking about our birthdays and brought us a dessert to share right off the bat. He was the kindest server ever and we loved talking to him. He got us everything we needed and then some I just can't explain how happy and lucky we were to have Chandler! Amazing amazing experience and service. Will recommend him next time and so should you!!"}
{"text":"Such a great place to hang with family and friends.  Took a large group of people there for a Birthday party.  We brought an ice cream cake and they stored in refrigerator until we were ready for it. The food and staff were really cool.  One of the managers (Karen) was excellent.  She asked us about the service and made sure we got every thing we need.  It wasn't a cheap night but totally worth it."}
{"text":"We went to the location in Gilbert. Super fun atmosphere- great place to go with friends! Fun, affordable night out. Thought the prices were great. Service was just okay- we ordered a drink that took about 30 minutes. Received our food and everything was eaten by the time it finally came. Think it may have been a result of a busy night, but nonetheless not overly impressed with how the  server handled the situation. But we will go back just because it was a fun activity and we enjoyed ourselves!!"}
{"text":"This place was so much fun! The mega bonus is that they have an incredible pool with cabanas and floaties, so yes, bring your bathing suit! They have lockers and towels for you. You can do so much at Top Golf, obviously you can come play golf, drink, watch a game, and then hit the pool. I also really liked their pro shop.

The only cons were the service and food, we waited about 10 minutes at a table and no one came up to us to ask us for our order or give us water. I had to go hail someone for this. Secondly, I ordered the chilaquiles and they were awful. Chilaquiles are supposed to be a warm breakfast option but here they were basically cold nachos. I honestly wanted to send them back but just settled on eating a few bites and letting them be.

I'll definitely be back for the entertainment but will probably choose to eat beforehand."}
{"text":"Good excursion away from gambling.  Really fun for non-golfers and golfers.  Are drank and played cornhole."}
{"text":"I waited longer than approximately told by the rep, let alone ten minutes, was 30 more minutes than promised at the front desk manager. Working in retail has taught me one thing. Be honest with your guest regardless of wait time. They would rather know the truth, than to feel like you are lying for them to pay. 

Courtney is the only reason our bachelor party left safely without playing. I appreciate the free offers afterwards, but the truth is simple here, your entire front desk team needs a revamp. If you hate your job, quit. Don't make your guest feel like they need to be rich and tip you to have a good time. You should give the same service regardless of price paid. I was offered floor 3 as a parting gift to waiting almost two hours for one swing. I will surely spread the news. If your on vacation, save your time for something more fun that won't have you waiting for 2 hours to swing a golf club at a night club.

Thanks nick for comping my $20 tab that was still charged to my card. Thanks for taking an extra 20 minutes to close out my tab because you guys were called on unprofessional customer service. If your on vacation, and you saw the hype of this experience beforehand as I did, let this review be a reality check. You will wait a while. Something the front desk has a very hard time being honest about."}
{"text":"Fore! 

My husband and I were invited for a company event.  Many of the employees gathered for some golfing fun along with some shared food.  The facility is very large but incredibly clean.  It is set up like a driving range with points to score.  It's definitely family friendly and fun for all ages.  

In addition to golfing, they offer a wide variety of menu items for groups or just one.  I had nice options of pulled pork, burger sliders, veggie trays, chips with guacamole and flatbreads.  The best of all were the injectable donut holes with jelly, chocolate or vanilla filing.  Certainly delicious.  

The only downfall is when the temperature is warmer, the mister system automatically comes on in all golf bays.  So if you have food and drinks sitting on the table, it all gets the lovely mist on everything.  The waitress said there is no way to shut them off.  I would hope they could remedy this situation.  

All in all it is a fun place that hosts locals and visitors.  Even for me, who is a non golfer, I would recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"Brought my husband here for his birthday. My advice: GO EARLY. We got there at 5 on a Saturday and only had a 20 minute wait for the top floor. That gave us just enough time to have a drink at the bar and munch on some chips & guac. 

Since it was our first time we were escorted up and given a run down of how it all worked. Our bay had cushy couches and our server Kenny was prompt and attentive. Try the Mushi! Spicy and delish. 

I've never golfed before so I was nervous I'd really suck and wouldn't have fun. Not so! I had a great time and my hubs loved the gift. One hour was all we needed."}
{"text":"Really fun place. Food is good and the service is always on point. Anyone can go here. You don't need to be a golfer at all to attend. It mixes golf, bowling, and darts all in one. If you want you can also just hang out and watch some TV while people swing. I only wish they had some better happy hour pricing."}
{"text":"Visited Top Golf on Saturday afternoon. It was about an hour and half wait to golf so we had a bite to eat. Ordered some buffalo wings and plain wings...they were great! Fresh and hot. I also had a Tequila  sunrise which was made just right. By the time we were done eating I was receiving text saying our station was ready for golfing. It was fun and we did an hour. It was 33 degrees outside but they had heaters on outside. The wait staff offered a hot cup of water just for hold to keep hands warm. I thought that was a great gesture. Friendly staff, clean facility and a bit noisy on the inside, kids are allowed and appeared some birthday parties were going on. Since alcohol is served, I wouldn't suggest small children. But I'll definitely give it a 5Star"}
{"text":"Still haven't played there, but tried.

The line is out the door and I'm there with my two kids for a little food and fun.  20 minutes of waiting outside -hot as heck at noon - we finally make it to the A/C.  At this point I get approached by a guy who informs me that \"We are an irons-only facility\".  I look at the golf bag I'm carrying - which belongs to my 8 year old son who, can hit it about 75 yards if he catches it all... but say, \"OK, cool we won't use it.  No biggie.\"  Then I'm informed I need to return it to my car. \" Really?\"  \"Yes\" I also had a plastic Snoopy driver in there, should I leave that behind as well?  And you couldn't have told me that 20 minutes ago - oh wait the staff didn't want to be out in the hotness any more than I did.

I took it out to the car, kids with me, and left.  

Maybe I'll give it a shot again, but based on the goat-rodeo that was my first visit yesterday.  I really wanted to LOVE the place as the place in only 5 minutes from my office - wish I had enjoyed it more, or at least had a chance."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience at Topgolf for a corporate event tonight..:   Brandon our server and lead onsite contact was spot on and attentive to all our needs.  Would highly recommend for your next team building activity.  Swing away  :-)"}
{"text":"After having heard many stories of how much fun my friends have had at Topgolf, I was really excited to finally get a chance to play. We had gone on a Saturday afternoon so there was a little bit of a crowd, however the wait time to get a bay was much shorter then I expected. The cost at the time we went was $35/hour; since we were splitting it 8 ways, it was very affordable.

Our bay was on the second floor towards the end so we got an area with a table and couches. My only qualm with this was that it was a little bit uncomfortable because we all had ordered food, and we felt that it would've been easier if we would've had a high top table and chairs (I wonder if you can request a bay that has that?). The great part was that our waitress was on point in getting us food & drink refills quickly & made some good suggestions. The price of the food was about what I expected & everything we got was tasty. I recommend the smores!!

It's a good thing that we were just playing for fun because the scoring system is a little awkward. Sometimes someone would hit a really good shot and it would not go into one of the scoring zones so they're get 0 points & the next person would hit not as good of a shot but the ball would keep rolling and land in a high scoring zone. I'm not good at golf so I didn't have high expectations for myself. I thought lowest points normally wins in golf anyways, right?

All and all, it was a really good time so we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Top golf was so much fun! Locals relieve 20% off and discount hourly rates for bays. We ordered almost everything on their food menu and I can't complain about any food! It was all delicious, the Asian wings were my favorite and also the injectable doughnut holes!"}
{"text":"Went this morning right at opening to beat the heat and the crowd. Got in quickly and didn't have to wait for a bay.

 We were a little annoyed because the employee at the bay reservation desk told us that it is currently an \"iron only facility\" so when you bring your own clubs you have to hit off the first deck and you can't bring your driver to the bay. Apparently people have been hitting balls over the net. They offered to check the clubs you weren't allowed to bring but we just ran them back to the car. They should have emailed members and posted signage but they did not. 

Our bay was fine. Nothing out of the ordinary. Took a few minutes for our server to get there, but she finally brought us waters and we ordered a round of mimosas. Those also took a while to get there -- her reasoning was because they had just opened and so things weren't ready yet (not an excuse). Mimosas were more like a glass of OJ with a splash of champagne which sucked. 

Overall golfing experience was fun. They provide rental clubs at each bay if you don't have any. Definitely come for the experience. It's a very cool place."}
{"text":"Great spot, awful service. We waited over the time on the third floor and ended up being seated in a vacant spot that was open for over 20 minutes. The lady setting up our game was great, the waitstaff was confused and no one was taking us when one of the waitresses asked who had our table. We ended up having a server come over start our drinks and leave for the end of her shift. Grateful she started us, but the next waitress was MIA the entire time. When trying to close out we decided to go to the bar and just close because it was taking so long. None of the bartenders came over to help. No one was sitting at the bar, the two gentleman were just talking to each other. Just sucks because this is a fun spot, doesn't mean you get to slack on the customer service."}
{"text":"Deshawn B. gave us awesome service  and the food was excellent! This is an excellent way to spend a few hours with family or friends!"}
{"text":"Top Golf is a combination of skee ball and golf. You don't have to be a good golfer to participate and have fun. There are various challenges and games you can play in a group setting. I hit an average of 85 yards and my co-worker hit an average of 200 yards. However, I beat him at the game because I was hitting the targets, and he wasn't. 

I've been here several times with my co-workers and we always have a good time. The food is pretty standard bar food but pretty good. If you want to save some money, don't reserve a bay in advance. It's actually cheaper to show up and get a bay that way."}
{"text":"Great concept, unfortunately it's expensive and they make it really difficult. You have to get a membership card and then load money onto that card. Of course they only let you load in increments, and the increments don't match the cost of the golf. Therefore , you always end up having too much money on the card. If you loose the card, they'll reprint it for you after waiting in the long customer service line, and they charge you to reprint the card. 

C'mon, why all the hassles?

Next time I'll go bowling and spend 1/3rd as much with none of the membership card hassl"}
{"text":"Holiday tradition! Great times and great service! The food is surprisingly terrific. Nachos are the best around. Easily caters to small or large parties and 100x's better than Main Event. Did I mention everyone that works there looks like they love working there and just adds to the overall great environment!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a company-sponsored event and hey - that means \"all you can drink\" so we got here early even. Hung out at the bar for a while. Mostly piss and shite on tap so I stuck to Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy in a can - best beer for lakes and state parks where they don't allow you to bring beer in bottles cause of their no glass policy. So we chilled and got toasted on the company dime while the rest of our co-workers showed up. Once we were all there we went upstairs in a big group to where we had a number of bays in a row rented out for our use. Some of the folks we work with are avid golfers who do this all the time. Me? Not so much. But there's nothing like getting toasted and slamming a little ball out into wherever - especially once someone told me to imagine that little golf ball is your boss. Bam! You hit that little booger out and I guess you're supposed to aim for various targets and a series of concentric circles around them decide what your score is depending on where your ball landed. Didn't matter - I was playing a different game than everyone else was apparently - just taking out my frustrations on a little white ball. Then food came. It was mostly little sliders, chicken fingers and chips - stuff you can get at most dive bars. Not ever gonna reminisce about that when talking about TopGolf. Afterwards when it got dark and our time was up we headed back downstairs to the bar. Got more drinks. Then someone had the idea of playing giant Jenga upstairs so we went to this courtyard type area where you can order from a bar and they also had a bunch of giant Jenga bricks. Stupid kid's game but it's fun after you had enough to become a stupid kid again. Played a few games and then my designated driver had to leave so I went too. All in all great place for a company-sponsored event. Not sure if I'd ever come on my own but I'm not a golfer anyway. Lots of parking - they have a pretty big lot. Your mileage, as always, may vary greatly."}
{"text":"It was a super fun location. Great service, great atmosphere. However it was 105 degrees outside and there is no air conditioning or fans where we were playing golf. It was a little too hot and uncomfortable for people who are from California and aren't used to that type of heat."}
{"text":"Spent our Father's Day with the whole family there  yesterday and beyond enjoyed our time!! Being in the service industry as well I had to take a moment and share that our server Kim was one of the best I've ever experienced!! Her personable personality and kindness didn't go unnoticed! Thanks again for such a nice day!"}
{"text":"The last couple of times that I have been here the rooftop patio is always closed off and or rented out. I understand, you are quite busy. That is the least of my concerns at a place I've loved for a long time. I need to make a very accurate comment about this place; the service is absolutely horrible! On more than 5-10 occasions I have come and sat at the ground level bar, new downstairs patio, or rooftop and it takes multiple people to recognize we have sat down and sometimes up to 15 -20 minutes to even be acknowledged or be served. I cannot lie or exaggerate about the timeframe! Trust me, I wish I was exaggerating. I first brushed it off because this was such a great place to come to but something needs to be brought to attention. I understand when the place is fully booked and events pack up the place and I have been courteous to timeframe of service in those circumstances. The problem I believe lies in the people you hire. You can't have 6 people behind a bar regardless if you are a bar back or not and not be acknowledged customers for long periods of time. The training just needs to be better at the very least greet people and say \"I'll be with you in a minute\" instead of no eye contact or acknowledgment. I hope management or someone can see that from a loyal customer who has come here since the opening, please fix or find a way to better train your employees. The sad truth is I've mentioned this to the last few people who have come to this location with me and they finish my sentence agreeing, I'm just the one finally making it evident to bring it to your attention. I love you top golf. Work on your service for the love of everyone!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate husbands birthday. Got to the desk for them to tell me our party Had to wait an hour and a half for the second level. The higher the level, the longer the wait. So we waited, but the time went fast especially with drinks. 
We got to explore the other levels and the views were so nice. The pools are more like tanning pools. I think the deepest I saw was 3'6. There's one on the 3rd level and the 4th. 
When our Bay was ready, Kyle showed us the ropes. He was really cool and explained everything. Once he left and we got playing, our system glitched. So we had a staff member to restart the game. Then the system screen froze *rolls eyes*. We had to get Charlie (I think he was the supervisor or manager) to fix that. THEN the censor for the golf balls to come out stopped working! Charlie had a system maintenance worker come restart the entire system for our Bay. Afterwards, every thing worked smoothly. Charlie even got the birthday boy a shot on the house as well as donut holes for the table and these cookie sandwiches. Those donuts with the filling were really tasty!
They even added more time to our Bay. 
Then came the checks. So you can have up to 10 people at your Bay, but they can only split the bill 6 ways *OMGEEEE* -_- so that had to be figure out but our server Johnie worked it out somehow. Besides the kinks, everybody had a really fun night. Not sure if I'll be back any time soon though."}
{"text":"So last week I came in with a rowdy group of eleven, we opted for two bays side by side because we all wanted to play, we ordered over half of the appetizers and kept our beverages coming and we played for two hours, not only was this immensely fun, we experienced amazing service from the get go. We walked in and were immediately greeted and asked about our group and our day and if we've ever been there before, most of our group hadn't ever been before, so we got our lifetime players card(s) and again AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE, or maybe just conversational skills, but everyone was smiling. We were brought up to our bays and our group divided up into two groups. 
Our waiters name was Philip I believe and he was darling, and after some begging swung a club for us, the guy who brought us to our table, checked on is regularly too! if I remember correctly there were two guys that also stood out to our group that just completely exemplified amazing customer service and their names were Nico and Mitch- thank you for a wonderful night- you guys rock!"}
{"text":"Not happy. The Waiter messed up our order and then the bay we got was at the far end which made it very hard to get in some good shots. Furthermore our bay had no heat unlike the other ones and it was pretty windy. All in all I don't think I will be coming back here anytime soon"}
{"text":"We took our out of town guests to Top Golf and had a blast. We enjoyed the target golfing experience almost as much as our company. Thanks Top Golf- awesome facility."}
{"text":"I went the other night with a group of people. The service was awesome, even with that many people. Mac our service was funny and always making sure we were taken care of. It was a very fun place and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Loved this place, you know right away that it is a hit when the parking lot is full and you have to park on the street. Don't let that deter you, it just means it is worth it. Great facility, everything is state of the art. Staff was friendly and fun. 

Some tips: If you are gonna play I recommend to eat before you play, the bay cost is $45/hour prices differ depending when you go, with food it will slow you down and you will have a lot of waisted time. Appetizers and drinks while playing are a go however!

Cons: Registering as a member took a long time, but you only have to register once. Parking. Service can be slow, but it is a huge establishment, a lot of ground to cover and extremely busy, was to be expected. 

Lastly, no Woods. Not a big deal, Top Golf really is not a driving range in the traditional sense. It's a target game, trying to earn points by hitting targets. It is a lot of fun and really great practice for the people who are going there just for that."}
{"text":"Stay away from Top Golf!!!
1. Online prices do not reflect actual prices.
2. Sketchy card handling and billing processes.
Bf signed a receipt for one price, they voided it and charged him over 300 more than agreed, without his knowledge or signature. 
3. Customer service is not handling their mistake well. 
Beware of bad business ladies and gents!"}
{"text":"What a great venue! 
Super awesome concept giving us locals something fun to do on the strip! 

Great service from check in to check out! 
Shout out to Nathan who made amazing drinks and gave excellent service!

4 different floors with 4 different vibes. 
*we came in at 8pm on a Sunday night*

1st floor is family friendly. Super chill with a bar behind the bays. I also saw a jenga game there.

2nd floor is also family friendly but seems a bit more lively with a bigger lounge area and bar.

3rd floor is 21 and over with a lot more space to chill with lounge area/bars/gambling machines and a pool.

4th floor also 21 and over but more like a nightclub atmosphere. Music seemed louder. Bar is busier. There are just a few bays up there. There's a lot more space to just drink and hang out. They could seriously turn the 4th floor into a nightclub or something. I think you can smoke up there too.

Food was also great!! Kalbi short rib tacos are a must!!"}
{"text":"I just visited top golf for the first time, I even brought my kids along. The staff was more than helpful in making sure we understood how everything worked. They even made sure my kids had the proper size clubs. All the games modes really made it enjoyable, plan on spending an easy two hours here, you won't won't to spend any less, trust me you'll enjoy it. Plenty of things to do here besides just golf. We might just have to have a \"business\" meeting here one day!"}
{"text":"Great place just ruined by REALLY poor management decisions: 
1st time I was there NO drivers allowed (!!!) WTF? Isn't it a driving range??? Oh, maybe they didn't build a tall enough fence?? Why should I pay for YOUR mistakes? Ask for a discount, all I got was a \"sorry\". Second time: NO drivers & NO hybrids (!!!) and best for last... This last weekend..: NO irons from upper decks (!!!) Yes, you've heard correctly; If you want to use your OWN irons you have to play from the lower deck, otherwise you MUST use the lame (and short) clubs provided by the place. It is a real shame that an amazing place like this has been ruined by such POOR MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. I will not go back to that place until they allow the use of ALL clubs (driver included). Make's no sense what they are doing. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. POTENTIALLY A GREAT PLACE JUST RUINED BY MANAGEMENT."}
{"text":"Definitely a place for tourist and locals to hang and enjoy a day away from the house and strip. Call for locals special. This is more better than taking the family bowling. Lots of menu options with kids menu. There's a huge gathering area to sit around play corn hole toss and watch games on big screens all over."}
{"text":"Had a great time with the family and got to enjoy an hour of golfing fun!  Although we had an hour and a half wait to play on the second level, we walked around and played in the gaming area.  Our server Jessica was quick and attentive.  There was even a band this night so we got to listen to some funky music too.  We hope to come visit again on our next family trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place looks exactly like the scottsdale location. Came here on another whim like last time but luckily you don't have to be entirely in golf attire. It costs $1 to replace your  card if you forget it. The wait was about 45 minutes. Downstairs has pool tables, shuffleboard, games and couches and upstairs has games too. I take it this location isn't as crowded which was good. Not sure what it was but this location also has tons of kids everywhere. Lucky kiddos. 
The concierge desk had one main guy helping out while he had 2-3 girls next to him. Not sure what their role was for standing next to him and not helping any customers?! 
Hit the balls with the hybrid, the dog and the 7-iron at the 3rd level bay for 4 for a couple hours. I might need a big Bertha for next time. $35 per hour if you're playing from 1pm to 5pm. Service wasn't exactly the fastest for ordering drinks like lemonade, water, Arnold Palmer, blue moon etc. Good thing we didn't get food. But the server was at least nice. 
Perfect 80 degree weather made the experience quite nice! Who wants to play?"}
{"text":"Our visit was excellent. The staff is just as friendly as ever. We encountered 6 different staff members and all of them made us feel like we had preferential treatment. The was great. I would certainly come back!"}
{"text":"Boy, is golf hard!! This is a great place to hangout with friends or take your family. Its difficult if youre an amateur and embarrassing when you miss 5 times in a row lol. Came here this afternoon on Labor Day. Place is really impressive and worth checking out. Super friendly staff, but the -2 stars is for the fact that a girl at the counter said it was an hour and a half wait. No problem, she gets my number to text us when one will be free. So my family and I wait in their nice lounge area contemplating if we should eat and come back. I noticed there were some empty bays on the floor and other groups were also getting told about the 1 hr+ wait. About to leave to get a quick lunch BUT great thing I talked to a different girl 5 minutes later asking if I can put down my sisters name in case we come back late. She ends up saying that our bay is actually ready. Super confused at this because people could end up leaving shortly after they were just told of such a long wait. They didnt even text me so I dont know what happened there?? Another - is for the fact that prices go up dramatically during weekends, nights, and levels. My suggestion is going with a lot of people to split costs and making each player hit 3 balls in a row so its faster than one person taking their one ball turn at a time. Also definitely stay behind the red line or expect a club to the face. The kids in the bay next to us ended up throwing balls with their hands. Didnt eat, but their menu looked good. Just watch out for the waitlist and in case get 2 different people to put their names down and check your status after a few minutes. Dont think I would come back unless I had friends to host in town or was invited by others."}
{"text":"Once you get to actually play, this place is pretty snazzy. But, dear god, the disorganized check-in process was totally bizarre and took forever. I made a reservation for a Saturday morning for the husband's birthday as we had yet to go there and didn't feel like chancing a wait. Arrived to a giant line of teenagers in one group loitering in the deafeningly loud lobby. Checked in with the concierge. Had baffling conversation about player's cards and the reservation. Everyone seemed confused. Finally got cards. Asked where we wanted to go, selected third floor. Told we could only use irons on the third floor at that point and requested to be moved to first floor. Felt bad about changing our minds, but hadn't been told that until we got there. The husband had brought his own golf clubs to play (which, amusingly, while left alone while trying to sort out the reservation, got played with by the giant group of teenagers as they thought they were part of the gift shop) but that also seemed to confuse everyone so we ended up just giving up and bag checking them to pick up later. Finally wandered to the first floor with only one other couple playing, we were then sat directly next to them...which was awkward as the music was so loud we had to yell at each other to be heard. Uh, hi, new friends, only a foot away, please enjoy while my husband and I yell jokes at each other as you both very seriously work on your swings. Service was okay in that it existed - I'm not really a fan of my debit card just being thrown on the table after opening a tab, little things like that make a big difference. The food was surprisingly good; we had the breakfast flatbread, chicken and waffle sliders, and a carafe of mimosas. Mostly, it would make so much sense to have a tab for everything and just check out at the end - reservation, player's cards, game time, food all on one check. Right now, it's all separated out so you are constantly paying bills, opening tabs, signing things. Bleh. I just want to hit some golf balls poorly and drink a mimosa. 


That said, beyond the spastic service, the driving range game is really fun with a bunch of different options for games, smart balls that measure distance, and more. We had a blast playing the game, especially once I finally realized the provided women's clubs were way too short for me and moved to the men's set. As a concept, it's great. But for the prices they are asking, the service really needs to be refined. (For two of us as first time players with breakfast and an hour of game play our total was about $100.) Mostly, it got us looking up traditional driving ranges in our area and figuring out how to pack mimosas to go. However, we both would totally go back again - no reservation for the morning, requesting the be sat not so awkwardly close to the only other people there, a couple flatbreads, and some mimosa-fueled slices to the sand traps on the sides."}
{"text":"This is where bowling and golf come together in the best way possible. If you are considering a visit I highly recommend it. Don't bother getting dinner before you come the food they serve is great!  Before you read the rest of the review realize that I had been to top golf several times without hiccups. I absolutely love the concept and we always enjoy our time there.  
After coming a couple of times and seeing the value in a membership I decided to sign up.  Upon my first visit as a member my group and I were unfortunate enough to experience some technical difficulties.  We ended up waiting at our bay for over an hour. I was very frustrated and rightfully so.  Upon returning on my next visit the memberships manager refunded me the entire night and apologized for all of the problems. No excuses. I felt the need to write a record after being treated so well after an unfortunate night out."}
{"text":"Super fun place! It's a driving range, bar, restaurant, and night club all in one. I came here initially with a group of my coworkers to celebrate the end of the fiscal year and even though most of them are not golfers we had a good time. I then brought my family back and we had fun hitting balls off of the upper deck. Yes, its a little nerve wracking when your 12-year-old decides to look over the edge but everyone had a great time and my wife and kids really enjoyed it as well. You don't even need to bring your own clubs, although if you're competitive you'll probably want to do so. Also, the food and drinks are good and no more expensive than any other night spot in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Loved the concept of Topgolf. Great place to bring non-golfers. Pretty much anyone can do it. The member registration is $5 per person on top of what you pay for a spot, which is kind of a funny charge. If you can remember to save your plastic membership card, then you won't have to pay to get a reprint on a return visit. Overall, everyone had fun. The server was very chill and I appreciate that she wasn't pushy about trying to sell food and drinks. The food reminds me of Chili's or Applebee's type fare and I like that they sell local, Arizona beer.

The staff did such a great job with our large group. We wanted to get the top floor and two adjacent spots and they were very accommodating. There was a little bit of a wait, but it was worth it to have our group together."}
{"text":"5 stars for Idea, less for execution.  And why can't Uber, google maps and waze find this place yet?

Its a cool concept, futuristic citified golf.  But, long waits, mediocre food and not the most pleasant of staff make it not something I would do unless friends talked me into it.  I am not an avid golfer anyhow.  Food is alright, but nothing special.

I dunno, I really like the concept and there is no competition, so I'm sure they'll do well.  And I'll certainly go back."}
{"text":"A nice idea for combining sports with food and beverages!

This is a nice place to come and spend an hour or two having a cool drink and getting a bit of exercise, although you are very unlikely to burn off more than you consume.

As a very inexperienced, occasional golfer this place was just about right for me. They provide a set of clubs at each spot along with table and chairs, as well as a server to bring food and drinks.

I did find the setup a bit difficult to get used to, though, because normally at a driving range you are on flat ground, but here you are as many as three stories high so it's a bit hard to judge your hitting the ball because you are trying to hit targets that are below you. 

Anyway, it was a fun hour or so, but I'm not sure if I would get used to the difference between there and a traditional driving range, but l do plan on trying it again sometime."}
{"text":"Finally!! Some fun entertainment that we can rave about in AZ!! 

Prepare yourselves with a golf glove instead of coming here on a whim (aka me) to avoid the possible blister on your thumb from gripping the golf club too tight. Came here before the 5pm rush for $35/hour. This place is great for groups. With your lifetime membership for $5 plus tax you can save every score that you ever made and check up on your scores. Waitresses/waiters will be at your bay to take your food/beverage orders. There are tv monitors if you really don't want to play golf too. Plushy couches to sit comfortably on for a party of 6. And there are misters to somewhat cool you off in the summer heat. 

Immediately got a bay in less than 5 minutes. Took the top view and awfully attempted to score points based on accuracy but failed miserably. Let's just say I would not want to share my score. I just have to come back and practice more. Also played pool downstairs and virtual darts. This entire place is busy on the weekends. You don't have to be in golf attire. Comfy clothes like flip flops, tank and shorts are good enough.  

Can't wait for the San Tan location to open up!!"}
{"text":"This place is the beez kneez! I am from Dallas so I used to go to the original all the time. Obviously like any business they learn as they grow. The one I went too didn't have lounge seating, didn't have free clubs at the bays and wasn't three stories. They get better every time! Kids love it, girls love it, everyone loves it. You have to check it out rather you golf or not."}
{"text":"Really fun! Even for a non-golfer, there's lots to do. The food is good, everything is clean and looks brand new. The technology is cool, too. Great alternative to bowling or even clubbing.  If you have a group this is the place to go hang out."}
{"text":"**Update** Changed from 2 to 4 stars

I was impressed by the staff after we were seated. Ky was helpful with explaining how everything works, Eva/Lucy were AWESOME, very attentive and checking up on us to make sure we were taken care of. I am happy to say that I will be back for the golfing experience but not so sure abt the bar.. 

Btw, we ended up leaving a great tip for Eva :)

================================

I'm here on a mini vacay from Cali.. Heard of this place opened a while back, thought I check it out.

Be advised.. I know its summer in Vegas but with no ceiling fans, it does get a bit hot. Be prepared to play naked!! lol

I came here with 2 buddies on a Sunday.
If Im gonna spend $60/hr to hit a few golf balls I expect good service. We had to wait for a spot to open up, so we went to an almost empty bar on the main floor. We sat there for 7 mins (I started a timer) as I watched 2 other groups get served b4 us and still no drinks. We decided to leave the bar.

Will update after if service improves. I mentioned to our host Eva abt our experience.. I guess the tips will go to her instead.."}
{"text":"This is a good time! It's pricey after 5pm, at $45 an hour, but it's definitely fun. It's cheaper earlier in the day at $25/hr. An hour is usually plenty for 2 people. 2 hours is usually sufficient for 4 people. I have never been disappointed with their food. Excellent quality. Drinks are not bad either. Their service is pretty decent. Staff is friendly. Cocktails are between $8-$10, Beer $4-$6, Wine $7-$12/glass, appetizers $6-$12, Dinners $10-$13. Plan on spending $100 - $150 on a date night ;)"}
{"text":"Awesome food even better customer service. Thanks Justin for taking the time to explain in detail the party options available to our team. My kids love top golf and I enjoy the kid friendly atmosphere. Everyone seems happy to be there."}
{"text":"I came to golf with my boyfriend and family a few weeks back. It was very fun! I liked how you can take turns like bowling. It was nice that there were several different clubs to choose from. I also liked that there were many targets to aim at also. The drinks are great too! 

Overall it was a very good experience. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"So much fun! We went with our two sons and the grandparents, it was an awesome place. Half of us golfed, and all of us are, drank and hung out. Super fun!"}
{"text":"Is this a new thing?? This place is super cool! Tons of stuff going on and activities to do. There's a bar downstairs and another upstairs (much less crowded). There's also restaurant seating for food as well as seats at the bar. Upstairs there's a foosball table, corn hole boards, and couches all over the place for lounging. Okay onto TopGolf... the membership card is $5 and good for a lifetime. The game is a driving range and the point is to hit the ball into colored areas on the field. The balls are microchipped so the computer tracks where the balls land and tallies the score appropriately. Like I said, super cool! Also, you don't even have to fetch balls in a basket; just wave the stick over the sensor and the device automatically dispenses a ball. Happy golfing!"}
{"text":"The pricing is a little high especially compared to other locations but it's Vegas and expected... plus the view makes it worth it big time! Hard to go to another Top Golf after going to the Vegas location. Other entertainment/games while you wait for a bay to be open and a lot of fun overall. I could easily go here every trip to Vegas. Did I mention the night view with the lights is amazing!?"}
{"text":"This place is lame. Long lines. Ridiculous requirements like not allowing an empty water bottle to be brought in. Food is average at best and overpriced. Unreasonable and unhelpful staff. I won't be going here again."}
{"text":"Best thing that happened to this town since HOV lanes on the 202! I have to take one star off because of the two hour wait times. If it wasn't for that it would like get 5 stars"}
{"text":"We came here as a family outing, 12 of us with one teenager, 2 under ten, and 10 non-golfers. We got 2 adjacent bays, so all 12 of us could play at the same time. We got there at 10:30 AM on a Saturday - no problem getting a bay. By the time we left at 1 PM, the place was packed, even on the 2nd level with some people waiting. Nice quality clubs in each bay, including lefty clubs and kids clubs. If you are successful at hitting the targets, you score points. So if there are some competitive sorts in your party, friendly betting is an option. There is also table-top shuffle board - more competition and more friendly betting. There is a large lounge area with big screen TVs (several college football games on while we were there). We planned to come for just one hour and ended up staying two and a half. Everyone had a blast. When we were there, it was $45 and hour for each bay. With 6 sharing the bay, the price per head is very reasonable (they do charge $5 per head to \"join\", which I felt was kind of tacky). The food service was pretty reasonably priced as well (and fairly tasty). We are planning on returning with 2 or 3 couples as an evening out. A very unique fun outing."}
{"text":"Had a blast! Ashleigh Z. and the other Ashleigh were great. Thanks for taking care of us 5 guys and for keeping tabs on my daughters. Food was superb. Definitely returning."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Lots of fun! Very cheap too! Came before 12 and it was only 25 an hour for the whole group. Food was actually really good as well and priced well. The fried chicken sandwich wasn't greasy and had pretty good flavor for 10 bucks. Would recommend to anyone who golfs, but the balls are made to not go as far with the 3 woods and such. My 8 iron would go 150 and the 3 wood maybe 200, but at that point you'll have overshot all the targets. Still great place! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"When we first sat down our server Bryan was very rude. We asked him for the drink specials and he didn't answer our question. He then told us if they had any it would be in the book. After waiting for 15 mins to get our waters, he finally came back to take our drink order. When we asked him about the menu he said \"he didn't eat the food because he avoids fast food.\" He couldn't give us any recommendations. We paid for 2 hours of golf time and we never had our waters refilled or fished cleared. We had to wave him down to place more drink orders. After complaining to the manager who adeptly handled the situation. Bryan loudly complained about our area to a coworker after we spoke to the manager. So therefore we left no tip for Bryan. When we were leaving he chased us out into the waiting area demanding to talk about the lack of tip. The fact that he had the nerve to aggressively come at me is completely unacceptable. All of our previous experiences at Topgolf have been wonderful. This server does not have a place there. It's unfortunate that you have a team member that reflects so poorly on your business."}
{"text":"The food is a little pricey but point of going is to spend some group time. Have gone twice. One for a family birthday and the second work bonding session. Wait time is long so don't expect to just hangout Judy for a few minutes. Plan ahead and reserve your spot."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last  night, totally unimpressed with pretty much everything. $75 an hour for a booth, so loud with techno pop we had to yell to hear  each other. Their computer system was screwed up everywhere from the check in desk to the bar the waitresses outside. The golf clubs aren't actually gold clubs, they are basically toys that look like gold clubs that day \"Top Golf\" on them.  Be badly managed with s bunch of very young people working there. Will never do it again. Sad."}
{"text":"Very chill environment, great place to be with a group of friends! There is a nice bar area on the bottom floor and top floor as well. Great food menu as well! Will definitely be back! Shout out to Briel for her excellent customer service!!"}
{"text":"The food & drinks and the place is very nice.  But I have to give them 1 star because they don't plan properly.

Are wait for today is one hour & half because 2 Floors are for families & 1 floor that has the shuffle board etc going for a charity.  It's tough for a 10 year old to wait that long.  With the prices they charge management needs to figure it out & take care of families better.  

I asked what about tomorrow we don't know.  I was hoping to change my review but every time I tried I couldn't."}
{"text":"So fun! And great place to hang with friends! The staff is sooo friendly and great service!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's kinda not that fun. Very over priced and messy. Probably will stay away from these and stay on real fields."}
{"text":"So I've never been to a driving range. I would say for driving range this place would automatically get a 5. It has a cool technology that tracks your ball which is awesome for someone that can hit a ball about 50 yards. We had to wait a few hours for a spot. So we watched the insane tvs (since it was impossible to get drink service) and played cornhole. 
But obviously I'm no pro but I'm a solid drinker. I would say they have the worst service. It was a good thing I snuck several drinks in with me. It was actually purely accident I had them on me. But at least I had something to drink when the server wasn't around. Margaritas are great so I would recommend. Being gluten free, I was told the only thing I could get would be the burger. Which is disappointing from food options but it was decent. 
I would go back just for the driving range with friends again (if I'm in Vegas). Plus I had to pay for a membership. Not sure why..."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and came here for lunch the other day with colleagues. I have to say I really like the layout of the place. When you first walk in it feels like you are checking your bags into the airport, with the long line and people zig zagging. When you walk past it, you can see a large row of seats laid out liked a bowl alley and behind it were some seating space kind of like a lounge with a bar. There was this big ass TV, which was 16 ft high and 24 ft wide from what I remembered when I asked about it. 

We ended up dining on the 3rd floor in one of the booths and we ordered a bunch of food like buffalo wings, sliders, burgers, salad and pizza. Just a little bit of everything. Everything to be honestly was incredibly delicious. Top notch, the only thing I didn't like that the waitresses recommended were the fish sliders. I got the Memphis burger and I could be bias because I love PB&J but this burger was the best PB&J burger I ever had in my life and it came with a side of tater tots. Basic PB with raspberry jalapeno jelly with smoked pork belly and white cheddar. Delicious combo. I've had other PB&J burgers before and this one is for sure my favorite.

Now in regards to the golfing experience, I believe you pay by the hour and depending on what time of the day it is will determine the rate. The range is 200 yards long and there are targets you aim for to get points. There's a sensor in the ball that keeps track of where your ball and it will calculate the points depending on where it lands. My group did not consist of many coordinated people but when they were able to land a clean hit, it was a big deal and that made it very fun. 

The only issue is that it did get pretty chilly. I can see why all the waitresses were all wearing insulted jackets. Aside from that, I genuinely enjoyed my time here and can't wait to go back with a large group of friends. I wish I had taken more pictures to post but when you are having a good time, your phone should be set aside."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that we love Topgolf! Good drinks, decent food and overall a good time. Being from Seattle WA, we don't have anything like this back home and make a point to include Topgolf into our Arizona vacations, atleast once a year. This time though, we came in on a Saturday afternoon with our family and were expecting it to be busy. We were quoted a two and half hour wait time; long, but considered well worth it to us. We decided to sit in the bar and enjoy appetizers and drinks while we waited to golf. When we were reaching our quoted time, we went to the front to ask about how much longer we could expect. The person working informed us that their systems had been down that day causing longer delays and that it was going to be about another hour and half on top of the two and half hours we already waited! Being highly disappointed, we decided to leave. We understand that stuff happens, but they should've let us know about the system delays and extra long wait times upfront so we could've decided to go else where instead of wasting one of our vacation nights waiting for nothing. We could've spent our waiting time driving to the other location if we knew it was going to be THAT long. Like I said, we only make it down here a couple times a year and look forward to visiting Topgolf everytime. Between the 7 of us, we spend atleast $300+ each visit. We were so disappointed I don't know if we'll waste our time coming back. Topgolf is fun, but not worth having to wait 3-4 hours, especially when we're here out of town for only 3 nights. You can have wings and beer anywhere!"}
{"text":"The service was horrendous. I ordered a bucket of bottles and it took 15 minutes. We then ordered an appetizer along with the entrees and some people's entrees came so we asked about the appetizer and the waiter said it takes 28 minutes minimum. After an hour we searched for the waiter and cancelled the order. It then took another 30 to get our check. I can't speak on the golf because we were so upset with the food service we immediately left."}
{"text":"Great place! We went for a few drinks and some golf - really cool. Now, it takes some time to get your membership card but, once you get set up and playing, it's a great time. Family friendly too. We didn't eat but the drinks were priced right for the area. My wife had never even swung a club before and she had a blast!"}
{"text":"The expectation was high and the output wasn't that great until maybe after an hour. 

We had 10 guys for a bachelor party and only 6 can play. It was duable if you switch out players, which they let you do. When the TopGolf lady helped us add our names to the topgolf video game program to play golf, that took quite forever because they couldn't add the 6th player. For some reason, a 6th player from a previous game stayed on this list of our game and couldn't be deleted. Thanks \"Trenai Wilson\" who ever you are. Anyway, we just used his name and for some reason that username had the worst service getting the ball to be retrieved to play. It was quite the task. Then when we did get the ball, the ball did not get detected for that one username. It was very much a kill joy in the game. Everyone else was having an OK time, but a lot of time was wasted on this random user name. 

Aside from the problem, the establishment is very nice with TV's literally everywhere. A huge movie sized screen in the lobby area and then 3 huge ones facing where you hit. It was awesome. 

It is like experiencing a very fancy bowling alley, but for golf. The general format is as if you're in a bowling alley, but golf is the game. 

I tried some of the food and it's AOK. There is some kinks this place needs to fix because it will be awesome. Possibly have flashing lights when the ball goes in. There are many things for this place to be so much better and make it feel like you are immersed in the game. I think I would have to try it again, maybe, but as an on an off golfer, I'd rather play real golf. Thanks for the experience. Thanks for the experience."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Too bad the service wasn't the same. I am a Platinum member at the Roseville, CA location. The staff there is way better than here in Scottsdale. Most of the Staff did not know what they were doing they were not conscientious I had to continually ask for everything the bay hosts were too busy in little groups talking and laughing rather than helping their customers. Every time I needed something I had to hunt down my bay house because she was never around and never checked on anybody. Too bad you guys can't run a Topgolf like they do and Roseville."}
{"text":"We had a blast at Top Golf!!! We went during the daytime on a Monday around 4:00pm so obviously it wasn't as busy as the weekends. I would expect a long wait on weekends and probably wouldn't come on weekends as a local unless someone else was already here. We waited for about 2 hours for a bay which wasn't bad because we ate the food while we waiting and it was pretty good food. The kids had a lot of fun playing with the bean bags and other games they provided while we waited. The couches are really comfortable to sit on as well. 

Golf was so fun!!!! We ended up staying for 3 hours rather than 1 hour. It's impossible to just stay an hour, so be prepared to cough up more money for a longer stay. It's quite addicting. My favorite part was that there were HEATERS above us in the bay, so it was perfect as it got a little cold when the sun started setting. 

The only negative thing I have to say: the Bay seats up to 10 people, however only 6 people can golf at a time, and they never told us that up front. So we were kind of disappointed that we couldn't have the kids have their own section, we had to share golf balls with them and it affected our scores (and we are really competitive family).

Other than that, we had a great time and the service was great. We waited a little and paid a lot.... but it's Vegas, you've gotta be used to that."}
{"text":"I enjoy the concept. The building is sleek and pleasing to look at in nightime as well as daytime. (I drive by this location sometimes 4 times a day, as it is 5seconds from the ice rink, which i go to 6days a week.)
 HOWEVER, the parking lot?! seriously? My Frys grocery store has a bigger parking lot. It took me almost 10 minutes to find a spot. (for so many bays, which can have 6 people golfing on one, youd think they would have planned accordingly to HIGH number of vehicles) it was 4:45 on a saturday, i knew it would be crowded, however the parking lot looks bigger from the street. I ended up having to make my own spot behind another vehicle alongside a curb. (when i left around 7:45 i came to find two vehicles parked in the middle of myself and the car on the other side, they totally blocked a thru zone btw parking lot curbs. ) i saw valet, however i did not know how much it costs, and did not have cash on me.

The inside is very nice. very modern. but it was a bit of a zoo. i didnt also enjoy having to wait very long time to get bays. since theres no call-ahead reservations, at least thats what the rest of my party told me upon entering. i thought there was supposed to be a person available to teach you how to swing, or rumor was that. Im not asking for golf lessons, but if there was someone available to come and educate your party before starting would be top notch!. The server at our bay was very attentive and pleasant. 
They let us take the bay next to us that opened (since about 15 people ended up showing up and bays only hold comfortably about 8), which was very nice seeing as the location was busy!! the couches they have there were comfortable. One complaint was the heaters, you can turn off the ones by the tee but not behind by the couches, we were getting uncomfortably hot. I am eager to see how it goes for when its 115 degrees outside, better have strong AC!

However, a very fun atmosphere. I hope to come again, but honestly, that parking issue might just keep me away! Maybe go in the early afternoon/late morning. However, for the price of it, i should just come back after i learn how to actually swing a golf club again, since i stopped golfing when i was 10."}
{"text":"We have gone to multiple locations and this was the worst service we have ever gotten. Our server clearly could not handle big parties which doesn't make sense to me if you're going to be working at TopGolf? I understand being stressed with a large group of people but NEVER do you snap at your customers the way our server did."}
{"text":"My partner suggested we go to Topgolf as he recently attended a corporate event there which he enjoyed. I was a bit apprehensive being that I had not played golf in over twenty years, but I'm glad I gave it a try!  The facility itself is beautiful, especially compared to the old school driving range I knew back East.  The staff were all friendly and extremely helpful.  Although we didn't eat, or drinks were delivered quickly and the server was attentive, even assisting us with purchasing extra time via the kiosk.

Overall great experience and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Lots of fun. You can reserve a booth if you hit the limit, no wait. I guess if you had to wait, it does get really busy. We had a booth on the 4th floor, it's a whole lot quieter, and less people. I like that. However, you aren't allowed to use drivers there. The food was surprisingly delicious. There's a loop hole, if you drive it straight to the back, you get 50-75 points, versus 2-8 points if you hit the \"green\". This fancy driving range stuff is a great idea, I'm not sure why we don't see more of these elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ridiculous waits. Slow service for a simple beer. I get it. It's the \"spot\". But the waits and service are terrible. Miss managed and understaffed."}
{"text":"Went to top golf last night with the guys and had a really good time! First and foremost the ambiance is modern and inviting,second, the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. Our server Kirby did a great job attending us. And last it is very affordable. 

P.S. The prices on cocktails and brews are better then other places happy hour! Can't beat that !"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  The food was delicious and the service was top notch.  A special shout out to Jim the Manager there.  He's an A+, class act.  Made us feel special and like VIPs.  When I got home, I realized that I had lost my receipt for our corporate event with the best service.  Thanks, Jim!  We'll be back for sure and we'll be going to the one in Chicagoland area as well."}
{"text":"Was really disappointed with the service here. The activity itself is fun and has a great vibe but the servers were just awful. Came here on a double date last Saturday and not only were our orders incorrect but the server never checked back on us afterwards. My friend had to eventually wave down the server after waiting 20 minutes since she was just talking the whole time to another coworker on the other side of the bar. Would suggest coming for the golf games but get dinner beforehand at another place nearby."}
{"text":"Three stars for the fun time and bomb pepperoni flatbread I had, missing two stars because service sucked. This was my first time at Topgolf, and I had such a phenomenal time with my friends. We ordered our food 15 minutes into our golfing time and it wasn't brung out to us till 10 minutes left of our golfing time so about 35 minutes to get our food out to us! Server was very inattentive, and rude. It was a busy night so I am understanding if the kitchen and stuff were busy but all he had to do was relay to us that he was sorry for the wait and he would get it out as soon as possible, but of course not. Work on it Adam D, if you go you'll have a blast but make sure you don't have a terrible rude server everyone looked great and helpful except my server, totally my luck!"}
{"text":"My neighbor took me there last night to meet his brother and a friend, had been waiting since 6:30 employees everywhere but they couldn't seem to figure out how to get the people waiting to actually play?  We had seen open areas to up to 20 minutes before they got filled we left at 9:10 frustrated and disappointed.  What a joke get your shit together what horrible organization.  I don't understand for a franchise that is suppose to be successful fail on so many levels.  When we complained on the way out everyone was apologetic but did nothing to make it right. The parking was a joke as well."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out at! The place has fans and mist to keep you cool. Food and drinks are good and the place looks cool!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, had a great time. Server was really nice and the drinks were strong but reasonably priced. Could have had more instruction on using the technology but otherwise great afternoon weekend date spot"}
{"text":"Great, Fun place to bring families. Brent one of the managers in charge did a great job with making our experience positive after a few hiccups that happened and got us out of the sun. Our waiter Aj did a great job as well with his speedy service and interaction.   Thank You and we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Pretty fun activity for a group of friends to engage in. You don't need to know how to play golf or be good at it because some of the holes where you could score were really close-by. 

If you come early (before 11AM), your wait won't be too long anyway. 

-1 star for selling $28 pitcher of Modelo LOL"}
{"text":"I LOVE Top Golf! I come here at least once a week and it never disappoints. I would however work on timeliness of food service as well as promptness. Great establishment,  only a few kinks to work out"}
{"text":"It's pretty fun, service is still horrendous. It took over 20 minutes to get a beer and a good 15 minutes just to find your \"host\" to order one. I need to start bringing my flask everywhere!"}
{"text":"This review is just based on the service and the amount of fun I had....I can't really say anything about the cost as it was a company sponsored event... In other words...I had a blast on someone else's dime....:D

The service was top notch. They refilled our drinks before it was empty and they even showed me how to hold the golf club since I've haven't held one in over 20 years....Lol in other words, I really really suck. :) Empty plates and dirty napkins were cleared.... Silverware was replaced before I even missed them. Couldn't ask for better service. (5/5)

Fun (7/5)... Let me tell ya...I suck... And when I say I suck...I mean I really suck... But it was so much fun! Just hitting the ball... No matter where it ended up...I still had a blast. I might have sucked but the time you got to chat with the people that were \"golfing\" with your was great. And for me it was a great team building activity.

Overall, after checking out the prices I definitely want to come back on my own dime. It was well worth it. With the service being top notch and the fun I had... So worth it. I would recommend this to anyone. It doesn't matter if your are a golfer or not.... You will have fun! :) 2 thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"The second most fun you can have with a pole in your hand....

But really, SO FUN! It's the perfect mix of leisure and adventure. The multi-level driving range is a good time for avid golfers as well as first timers (like myself). Plus there's food and alcohol, which is always a bonus. 

HOW IT WORKS:
Each player pays a one-time $5 membership fee and then just pay by the hour for your games (anywhere from $25-$45 per hour depending on the time of day--earlier=cheaper). You can have up to 10 people per golf bay (the hourly rate just applies once--not to each person). Golf clubs are provided (but you can always bring your own!). Once you get to your bay, just swing away and rack up points by landing your balls in the targets. Each ball has a tracker so the screen tells you exactly where it landed and keeps score. 

BOTTOM LINE:
Go. Drink. Play. Be merry."}
{"text":"Darius was a very cool person!! He was dancing with me and my friends and was awesome! However, our server was horrid along with security. There were literally 6 servers/security men standing against the wall staring at me and my friends, making us feel SO uncomfortable during our entire experience for NO reason. None of us were doing anything wrong, yet we all felt so uncomfortable. I do not appreciate this!!! Overall, it had potential to be a good experience, but because of the lack of hospitality, I am appalled and will probably never come back"}
{"text":"We went out here after work on a Friday night, I had a good time for sure.  We had a booth on the main floor, it was really convenient. The waitress took really good care of us, she was a delight. Manager checked on us a few times which was nice. We ate the Sharable pretzel app... yum. With my belly full of adult beverages that pretzel was perfection. The bathrooms were really clean, I always check for that! I feel like the bathroom says a lot about the company. The only thing was I felt like it was expensive. I'm not a golfer by far so maybe I'm a bit crazy. But if you spend 2 or 3 hours in a booth plus drinking it's a pretty penny. I absolutely want to go back for more fun. 

Loud music check
Fun music
Alcohol flowing
Would return"}
{"text":"This place is truly amazing. It is a golf driving range with multiple games to play with friends. The whole place is a big party, yet awesome for families too. I had a flatbread pizza which was spectacular and my buddy had the steak sandwich and he loved it.

If you are a serious golfer, this is for you. If you aren't, it's definitely for you. I stink and had a blast!!  I will be going back for sure!!"}
{"text":"My family and I came from out of town to visit for the week and were really excited to come here for the afternoon. Upon arriving, the staff was really accommodating and helped us almost immediately. We went through the sign-in process and were told that the wait would be about an hour, so we decided to have lunch while we waited for our bay to be ready. Upon entering the restaurant/bar downstairs, we noticed that there was no host stand which we thought was kind of odd for a larger place, but we proceeded to seat ourselves. It took our waitress only about 5 minutes to get to our table, but after she took our drink orders, she almost immediately forgot and came back with the wrong drinks. We gave her our lunch orders, and the main courses (only two out of our 4) came out before the appetizers. 

She wasn't apologetic, but instead became critical of the kitchen and then began neglecting our table. We waited another 15-20 minutes for the rest of the food to come to the table, at which point, our bay was already past ready. We finally paid and went upstairs to golf. Our instructor was very polite and bubbly which definitely added to the experience. Golfing was really fun but the experience went downhill again as the service was slow. We ordered some donuts for us to eat while we golfed and they took an hour and fifteen minutes to get to our table, even after talking to the wait staff and them having notified us that they were almost ready 2 or 3 times. We finally got the manager involved and when we wanted to simply have the cost taken off of our bill, he said that would be a lengthy process so instead he offered to give us extra playing time. The staff upstairs WAS accommodating during the process, apologizing many times and checking on our table to give us updates, but this definitely lessened the experience. Why would a business that accommodates hundreds of people each day (if not more) not be able to get food out in under an hour? I may return if the management or service becomes a little better, but until then, I'll find something else to do when I come back to Charlotte."}
{"text":"I was told I had to come to Top Golf if I am ever in Scottsdale. Well, we all went and had a grand time!! We all played, had a few drinks to unwind after along day at work. Service here was on point and they were all very helpful in explaining the rules and the best approach to play the game. Really love the view of the Indian Casino with all the lights, and we even managed to see the dry Thunderstorm without the rain. What  a great time, and I highly recommend coming here after work, or simply to spend time with friends and family.

Until then, Cheers! ~ :p"}
{"text":"My friends and I were at Top Golf on Sunday, August 21st. Our server was August at booth 209. She was very attentive and sweet. Then at the end of the night, when the second level was closing and we were waiting to close out our tabs, a heavy set African American security guard was being very rude and trying to rush us out. We were still waiting for August to come back with our credit card receipts so that we could sign them and he says, \"Are these guys done yet? I have things to do, they're wasting my time.\" It was very rude, disrespectful, and unprofessional.  We finished signing our tabs and started walking out and he continued yelling at us in the lobby and threatening to call 911 on us. Then when I asked him for his name he got quiet and wouldn't tell us and started walking the other direction. The manager, Brent Klimow, then approached us and we spoke to him for a bit. We also asked him what the security guard's name was and he wouldn't tell us. I've been here a few times now and my friends wanted to check it out but I've never been treated so poorly, especially for no reason. If the security guard had things to do after he got off work, he should still be professional and finish his shift. There was no reason for him to be as rude as he was. We knew they were closing and we weren't just lounging there for no reason, we were waiting for our server to come back with our tabs. We're all locals and work in the industry and the way he was acting is not how anyone should be treated."}
{"text":"I always have a great time at topgolf. It is fun even if you don't know how to swing a  golf club. Good food+ exercise+entertainment all in one!"}
{"text":"Now that I've been here a few times... I guess it's fair to say that this is an amazing concept! Staff is friendly and the venue succeeds all expectations. Food is great! I'm a big fan of the rock shrimp and steak skewers!!! Drinks on the other hand, are made poorly and watered down. Riding a classic drink like a Manhattan would be a mistake here. I place the blame on the ice, it's so thin that it dilutes quickly and changes the elements of the cocktail. I was even given samples of their sangria (white and red) and although it wasn't horrible, it was great either. The samples were straight up. The pitcher came out with bundles of ice and bar fruit, when I expected seasonal fruit. The ice completely changed a sangria that was already not the best, to one of the worst. The pitcher was also suppose to come with souvenir cups that were never received. Basically, if you still with a straight shot or beer, you'll be satisfied. If you need a cocktail, opt for a simple one, like a mule or rum and coke."}
{"text":"Horrible service! It took out group 40 minutes to get drinks and food. When ask the server said there was a mix up! They would come by and take our half full beer and take it away. They would say sorry and do it again. No management was around. This will be the last time I will come to this organization. Customer service is NOT a priority!   Thanks top golf for shitty service!!!"}

{"text":"I'm not that into golf, and the concept of awkwardly watching girls in heels swing and miss the ball strikes me as odd. The food, though, is really good. They have a lot of options to choose from, and the prices are beyond reasonable. The bar/restaurant area is really nice too."}
{"text":"Michelle was a great help in making our time at Top Golf great! 

We had an issue with our machine (some software error) because the guy that was playing with us had a high score that broke the game. 

She visited with us, and made sure the issue was corrected in a timely fashion, and would highly recommend coming back."}
{"text":"The golfing experience Is really cool & fun. I think offering food and drink services is awesome, however I am totally unimpressed by the food & service. I ordered a pepperoni flat bread pizza. It was chewy & gross like microwaveable pizza. Our waitress was super slow we got 1 refill the whole time & we were drinking like crazy (as its hot outside). Too bad /: (currently waiting for my French fries I ordered 20 min ago)"}
{"text":"Ok, your TG is on juice but gambling doesn't give any comps. Supposedly random and hard to believe. 3 drinks while gambling over $50 in the machine and $48 for those 3 drinks. The new bartender says \"it's Vegas\""}
{"text":"A little pricey after 5pm ($45 per hour) but it was fun. Not for actual driving range practice. 
Probably be more fun for groups of non golfers just having fun. 
Music was a little too loud for my taste. Very polite service and food was good."}
{"text":"Get here early or there will be a long wait. Their staff is really nice. Their popcorn shrimp is bomb! Have fun playing and drinking!"}
{"text":"No wait...not crowded during the week and we all had a blast including my 3yr old! They have lil G-clubs for the lil ones, drinks for the big ones and service is awesome! We need this in Hawaii!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars! Service is terrible and not to mention rude. They just can't seem to answer the phone in the front after calling multiple times. 10/10 would not recommend"}
{"text":"This place is tons of fun! great hang out for friends and families. Can get a little pricey, especially when you have kids. I don't get why you NEED to purchase a card to play especially when this place works just like a bowling ally and you don't need one there. Just feels like a money grab. I would still recommend this place to anyone looking for a night out."}
{"text":"I visit top golf at least once a month when I make my way to Las Vegas, but this time changed everything. Bay host Hayley made my experience excellent. The wait was long and I had been a little irritated standing for an hour,but once Hayley came to assist us my entire mood changed. She was sweet, funny, and extremely attentive. I will make it a point to only come when she is working. I recommend everyone to ask to sit in her section!!"}
{"text":"We had a blast as always! But our bay host/ server CHANDLER was by far the highlight of our night! He was super attentive and felt like one of the crew as soon as he welcomed us! He also made sure we were being safe and had sober rides home! We love you Chandler!! And Adrian was a top notch 2nd in command!"}
{"text":"Pretty fun way to kill some time in Vegas if you want to get away from the traditional vices for a bit.  Especially recommended if you're a golfer like me, although judging by people's swings  I suspect that many patrons here are not golfers.

Pros:  

-Beautiful facility, places to lounge and TVs playing sports everywhere.  This is probably a good place to come just to watch a basketball or football game.
-Climate controlled hitting bays (wasn't too hot in the hitting bay even on a 110 degree day).
-Golf games are pretty fun, I recommend Topgolf and Topchip.
-Contrary to some other reviews, the service I received was pretty good.  Drinks came quickly and they explained the system and games pretty well.  I went at a non-peak time though (about 4 pm on a Sunday).  I think this place gets a lot busier at night. 
-Tip:  you choose how long you want to play, but if you want to stay longer, you can extend in 15 minute increments.  So don't feel pressured to finish a game right on time, you can extend without having to pay a whole additional hour.
-Tip:  clubs are provided, and they are actually decent clubs.  However, I'd recommend bringing your own golf glove. 

Cons:

-Valet parking is not located right at the Topgolf entrance.  Valet is located about a 10 minute walk (or short shuttle ride) away from the entrance.  Maybe we lucked out, but we didn't have to wait long for a shuttle at all.  If you don't want to valet, you can park in the MGM self-parking lot adjacent to the valet; however, I think this might be a pay lot.  It was free when I went, but that might have been because it was a Sunday.
-A little pricey for what it is, and kind of lame that they charge more to be on the 3rd floor (with a slightly better view of the targets).  
-$5/person for a \"membership\".  Not a huge deal, but I wish I had known about this beforehand.
-Golf system is a little glitchy but not terrible.  Some of the shots (especially shots that did not land in a target) did not register in the system.  The targets do not distinguish whether you hit a shot with a nice arc straight into the target, or you hit a terrible shot that happens to bounce into a target.  Not sure if there's a way to correct that.  But overall, not a huge deal esp if your goal is just to have some fun with some friends."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Top Golf. I went with my daughter who had been previously. This place was awesome. After we checked in they took us right away. Since I had never been, an employee took us to our \"bay\" area on the third level to show me what was up. There was an L shaped sitting area with a table and a heater (If needed) She showed me how the machine scores, and even how to hold the club (lol)  and golf. We had a waitress who was very attentive. I don't golf. And I am not any better than before, but the whole experience was really cool. For an hour and 15 min and 4 beers, it was about 120.00. It was worth it though, and I would do it again."}
{"text":"Had such a fun time here! The wait time was only about 20 minutes for the 2nd level, and our server Byron was fantastic! I love the concept of turning the driving range into a game, and the food/drinks on top were awesome. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing place for playing fun golf. It was my first time playing golf and i loved it because it is fun golf. You just stand on a platform and hit the golf ball and try to make it land in different circles. Music is amazing as well so it is a very fun way of playing golf!!!"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly. I had a fun time here. The drinks are pretty pricey, but they were tasty. Didn't try any food."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here the wait is wayyy too long and we end up leaving. This place is overrated so stupid. I got \"too drunk\" and got kicked out. Now im stuck on an indian reservation. Awesome."}
{"text":"Great entertainment and venue for the whole family ranging from the ages of 12-50. Loved the ambience filled with music and the football games on TVs. The staff at Topgolf truly cared about our family and having a first class experience! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I LOVE Topgolf!

I was not very impressed by this one in Las Vegas! The food was great and so was our waitress. It does tend to get a little on the pricey side though if your are playing, drinking and eating. 

Now the reason I gave it 3 stars...

Some of their heaters were not working in other booths so we had other customers coming to our booth to warm themselves up. That is something that should be resolved. 

We ordered two playing cards, received two and was charged for three! Didn't realize it until we got back to the hotel and by then it was worth calling or hassling anyone about it. 

When we ordered our drinks, one of them had a bug or two floating around in it! It was absolutely disgusting. All we got was an apology and a replacement of the drink. This place did not go above and beyond to rectify the situation. I expected a discount or at least a comp of the drink that had the bugs in it....but no, nothing. In situations like this I don't expect to ask for anything, I expect for it to be given without asking. 

None the less we still had a great time and ended up spending an arm and a leg but truly enjoyed ourselves! 

Be careful and check your drinks to make sure there is nothing floating around in it out of the ordinary!"}
{"text":"Maybe I just had bad luck but my first experience was about a year ago, my wife and I decided to try and brace the triple digit temps and check the place out. Before any negative comments I do want to say how friendly and helpful the staff was. BUT when we got there they said it would be a short wait, which was fine since we could sit at the inside bar and cool off and have a drink, good service, good bar tender. Then we got the call that our stall was ready and we went through the tutorial and then the machine started to malfunction, and they told us it was because they were expecting a corporate event and the computers were locking the system. They politely asked us to sit in a lounge area while they tried to fix the issue. Fast forward, an hour later, we're still waiting so we decide enough is enough we want to cash out pay for our food and drinks (which were good) and leave. The manager refunded the golfing sick we didn't golf and comped the food which was more than necessary but appreciated. THEN on our next trip we were approached by someone working for Top golf in the MGM and told them the story, he made contact with his manager so we could have a \"do-over\" with a discount, we were on board and waited for the management to contact us but they never did. Maybe another corporate event had him busy. If you can golf it looks like fun but it didn't work for us."}
{"text":"Enjoyed top golf , servers , bartenders very helpful . Overall a great atmosphere plenty to do with friends. A little pricy but well worth the splurge."}
{"text":"Top Golf where you spend a lot of money, that should be a slogan for them. Top Golf is nice it's close to everything you want like talking stick or even old town Scottsdale. This area is a fun and a growing area and you will have fun coming here if you have a good group of people. Friday-Sunday night there will always be wait times sometimes even to an hour which is expectable because it always happens with how buys this place is. If it's your first time you have to get a card that's 5$ but you get to keep it forever. You go to your bay or section and you slide the card into the machine and each player has to do that. It's basically like bowling. After that you select how long you want to play so 30 minutes to an hour to two hours it's on whatever you guys want but obviously more time more money. One hour is 45$ so you have to split that with your group. I've came her a couple of times over the year and the menu changed this last time I was there with new products and taking some things off. I ordered the Bacon and Cheese roll and they were out... The biggest picture on the appetizer page and they didn't have and the girl suggested it. I ordered chips and guacamole and they give you so much chips and barley any Guacamole or salads. Why?? Because they want you to order more obviously more $$$ but if you know good guacamole you won't be ordering more because it's tasteless and lacks flavor. Also my friends ordered the same and mine came out 5 minutes after.. Didn't really make any sense. I also ordered the quesadilla and it was gross they put so much peppers and no cheese at all for the price it truly sucks.. Don't get the peppers in it maybe it will be better. Another mistake they made where my food just came out late but we all ordered the same thing.. Like my friend got the same order and my quesadilla just didn't wanna come. I guess the girl forgot it so I reformed her and she said she'll go check after about 10 minutes I ask her again she replies with \"it's only been 7 minutes\" what kind of customer service is that??? Shouldn't I get \"oh I'm sorry it will be out soon\" just give me some BS don't reply with how longs it's been like it hasn't been long at all. Service is just terrible. The food all has no taste and had a big price.. So food sucks and you get a golfing experience but you can't smoke or vape. This place could be 100 times better if they knew what they were doing. It's fun but nothin"}
{"text":"The customer service at guest services is spectacular. They helped my party and me through everything and got me seated quickly. The staff was extremely welcoming and sweet. I love this place and will definitely come back"}
{"text":"We had a great time. It was pretty busy on a Sunday afternoon. We waited an hour and a half for a spot. Luckily they text you and a casino is nearby."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a team outing, party, or get together.  About 40 of us went to TopGolf recently.  We had a great time and the staff there was awesome.  We had 4 bays set up and had a couple personal waiters to help us out.  There were about 4 people from their crew that got us all set up.

The drink menu was very good.  We tried several appetizers and they were all pretty good.  It was bar food type options but done fresh and well.

I would definitely come back here again and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Topgolf is such a fun place to hang out!!! I've been there a couple times recently. Watched the NHL hockey game on the huge tv and played some ping pong while others golfed. Ordered the portabella mushroom burger (vegan) and it was great!!! Both times I was there the parking lot was full so had to park at MGM parking garage but there is a shortcut from there to walk to topgolf. Would like to check out the pool one day. Definitely a great upscale place to bring your friends for some fun!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a random Monday because friends were in town. We did Valet and a LIMO picked us up and dropped us off at the front. FREE of charge!!! Talk about VIP lol! Got here the staff were all smiling made me feel so welcomed!!! Then Damien saw me struggling and personally  taught  me how to properly golf, You just made my experience even better. . You're awesome!!  I'm a first timer playing Golf, except for my Miniature Gulf days and now I feel like a pro! My hosts Medalid was so motivating to our group brought energy and charm to our group. This was an amazing day experience!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, this place was pretty freakin cool. The family and I have been to Vegas a few times before this recent trip, and have heard all about it. This time, we decided to try it out. Got here on a Friday morning around 11am after we called their customer service number (which told us there'd be no wait time). We wanted to play during the least expensive time 9a-12p. First thing was that when we got there, we were told there'd be a wait time of about an hour. I looked through the place and seen several \"bays\" (tee boxes) that were available, and several employees waiting to escort people to their bays. Then I was told that the price for the bay would be according to the time we cashed out with our server. The prices on Fri-Sun are $45/$60/$75 9a-12p/12p-5p/5p-close. Mon-Thu prices are $15 cheaper. 

Since we got this new information, we decided to come back the next day and try again. Which we did, and thanks iHeart Entertainment renting out the entire 2nd and 3rd floors for their staff working the American Country Music awards the next day, our wait time would be 60-90 minutes again. And we were there at 10a. So Sunday it would be, and at 9:30, we get checked in. Typical of Vegas, the wife and I decide to say drink and got a Tropical Sangria, and a pint of Lagunitas. $20 for those two drinks, but on a good note, the kids lemonade and Sprite were free. After playing for an hour (super fun hitting into the targets), we cashed out for $80 (including tip), and headed to the game area to lay cornhole and shuffleboard for another half hour. The kids enjoyed it, and they had lots of fun. 

A few things kept this very entertaining place from getting my 5. 
#1 the communication between the call center and the venue itself
#2 The price of a pint of beer (I get it, it's Vegas)
#3 the wait time for a bay even though there were several employees \"standing around\" with several bays open. Reminded me of Walmart in that sense. 

Hopefully some the things I talked about will get worked out for the new business."}
{"text":"Amazing experience, great atmosphere, food is also surprising good.  The service is good as well.  It's a must go to spot!  Just a bite on the pricey side."}
{"text":"This place absolutely rocks! I have never even played golf, but this may be my gateway.

The service, staff, ambiance, and overall experience is fantastic! It's also a GREAT place to gather with friends. 

I suggest going in the evening because it gets even better when the sun goes down. The lights are reminiscent of Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"This was my first time ever golfing and I cannot express how amazing my experience was. The service was top notch and made me feel like a VIP. We didn't have to worry about a single thing. My friends and I were able to enjoy each other's company, the golf, and also the incredible setting. Beautiful couches and a spotlessly clean environment. The only downside was that it was quite warm (as it is summer time in the desert). They could've included additional fans to make it slightly more comfortable. I cannot wait to come back for more fun!"}
{"text":"Love Michelle (the team lead)! Every time we come in she is always in a great mood! Always love coming in when she's here"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with service in lounge. No silverware no napkins. Drink service not bad but very slow. Service in the golf bays was much better. Fun way to play some fun golf."}
{"text":"Topgolf is amazing & so much fun. Even if golf isn't your thing, it's still a great time and worth checking out. Yes, they have a few flaws/kinks, hence the 4 stars. But if they can get them worked out, and I think they will, this is easily a 5 star review. 

So what is topgolf? 
It's a driving range, with a bit of bowling and darts influence. The range is set up in bays. Each bay can accommodate up to 6 players (or non players).  Each bay is equipped with a scoring monitor facing the group, a TV with choice of 12 channels, a scoring monitor for the golfer, a couch & table, right handed male/female golf club (left handed are available upon request), and a charging station where you can plug in your phone (charger or USB cable required). 

Each bay has an assigned hostess. Who will take your drink & food orders and follow up to see if you'd like to extend your play time. 

The scoring monitor is touch screen, and allows you to choose the next player. Each player can hit as many balls as they like to. Once done, choose the next player.  This is great if your companions go MIA, haha. 

To get a ball, the player waves their club over a sensor, which dispenses a microchipped ball associated with the player. The player then hits the ball, and the scoring  monitor displays where the ball landed in the driving range (based on the microchip location). 

The driving range has a series of pins, with zones setup similar to darts. The closer to the pin you land, the more points you earn. Also, distance earns points. 

The scoring monitor allows you to choose from multiple games, where you can work on distance, short game, or just earn points by landing in points zones. For more information on the games, consult the website or the scoring monitor, or ask a hostess at topgolf. 

Fees to use the bay's are based on hours played. It's the same cost for 1-6 players in the bay. And can range from $30-70 per hour depending on the time and day. Check website for pricing.  

Other cool things topgolf offers: 
2 pools with a swim bar. 
Beer pong 
Cornhole boards 
Plenty of seating. From chairs to couches to weird chairs to ottomans. 
4 levels - level 1/2 kid friendly 3/4 21+ 
Several bar locations. 
Server service with food/drink anywhere in the facility 
Free entrance. So if you have friends playing, no fee to hangout. 

The flaws/kinks:
These may have been due to opening weekend & can be easily overcome with a little training & staffing. Btw, I won't let these flaws keep me from coming back...just including them in my review for full disclosure. 

1) Mandatory valet. I'm all for valet, but it's unnecessary in a parking lot this small. Furthermore, they don't have enough staff to park the cars in a timely fashion, which results in cars blocking Koval waiting to get in. The through lanes were blocked both times I visited, making it difficult for those taking a cab/Uber to drop off/pick up. 
Note: if you are on the strip, you can either walk here or take the free shuttle from mgm. Shuttle run times are listed on the website. 

2) The scoring monitors are a bit glitchy. It is a new establishment. So I think they're working this out. We had an issue with our monitor, and the hostess credited the 15 minutes we had to wait. She was very friendly and handled it quickly. 

3) Staff knowledge. Again, this will work itself out with time. When I asked about the use of the pool & fees, I was given different answers. The first guy said you have to rent a cabana, which didn't add up for me as there were plenty of non-cabana lounge chairs. The second person didn't know. And the third person said they thought customers can purchase a wrist band or rent a cabana, but didn't know pricing & told me to talk to group reservations. The group reservations desk was busy, so I never got a straight answer. Prices for the golfing are listed on the checkin board, but not for pool use. The other lack of knowledge happened when we ordered donut holes for dessert, which come with choice of 2 fillings but for $1 more can try all 3. We ordered all 3, but the hostess wasn't aware that was a menu option."}
{"text":"While the games are a lot of fun, the service here is consistently horrible. Good luck ordering drinks and food, or even getting anyone to acknowledge your existence for that matter! This place is a joke!"}
{"text":"We did one hour on the family level and one hour on the 21+ level. This location is very interesting and fun though the staff still needs to work some of the kinks out. Our table hostess had to ask for my credit card 7 different times when she couldn't figure out how to bill us. Then she realized 3 of the previous charge attempts had actually gone through and had to void them. According to her, not to worry though as the funds would be returned in 2-3 weeks. We had a really good time despite issues with check in and our hostess' surprisingly low IQ."}
{"text":"Called in advance and person said there was a 30 min wait.  Ok so we'll walk over, as they don't take reservations. Arrived at facility and they said wait was 1 hour for first floor bay (60 min for 2'md story), so put my name down and went to grab a drink.  Went back an hour later to see where we were and they said there was still 13 groups in front of us. WTF?!?!?! 
There was at least 13 bays opened that we could have golfed in during the time that we waited and the time they told us there was no opening for another hour. 

This place has no clue on how to operate a facility of this magnitude.

I was told that the morning team and evening team did not communicate properly...and so this is my fault how? 

Poor organization and overall experience"}
{"text":"I have been there several times.  The first, the restaurant was empty and the service was so poor.  The second, the wait for golf was 45 mins, but here was empty stalls to play golf.  The policy is they need to have servers at all stalls to be active.  I ended up just getting a refund and leaving.  I call and email to make comments, but no response. They simply don't care.  Great place, service sucks.  I think it about food and drinks then about the golf experience."}
{"text":"Not a bad concept for Vegas. A club like sports venue with a pool. 4 levels of driving, 4th level is reserved for private parties. We came here do something fun. For a party of 6 it came about $20 each, not including any drink, food or additional time. 
Here's the problem...everything is timed. It's based on hourly price. If you come in early it's not as expensive, the later you show up to drive the more expensive it is.
The customer service is ok. The bar service is ok. Yes, the food and drinks are on the high end (not the \"buying a brand\", more along the lines of Red Robin prices and higher)
If you can tolerate the Vegas heat and swing, more power to you. Outdoors is more of a spring/fall sport, which TopGolf falls into."}
{"text":"Horrible bar service! They could make so much more money if they had decent bartenders!! They are awful. They have zero personality and the Asian girl was more worried  about what she looked like then helping someone. I asked 4 people for my tab. It took 30 minutes in an empty bar HORRIBLE SERVICE. Get it together top golf"}
{"text":"This is based on customer service. Their customer service is non existent. 

I called on a Monday, 4/2 wanting to know how much the pools cabanas for Saturday, 4/7 are. The girl I spoke to said they dont have pool cabanas. I said YES you do. She said ok hold on. I was on hold for several minutes. She comes back and says OH yeah we have a pool but its closed and we dont know when it will be open. I say \"YES your pool is open this weekend. CHECK YOUR WEBSITE ITS OPEN.\" She puts me on hold for several minutes AGAIN and says \"Oh yeah its open so what do you want?\" I say I want to rent a cabana and I want to know pricing. Shes like oh you have to call back. I said NO I want to speak to a supervisor. Supervisor gets on the phone and says its $300 for 5 people and you only get the cabana for \"like 2 hrs\". I say ok thanks.

I email their event services and tell them the story. They said yes its open, they tell me its actually $250. I said ok I want to rent it and how long will we have it for? He responds with \"do you want a golf bay or just a cabana?\" I said cabana. Its been 3 days. No response.

I'm literally trying to give this place my money lol Im like hey here is $250+ please take it. TAKE IT. They advertise on their website how amazing their pool is but I guess I wont be able to experience it."}
{"text":"I have never had this bad of an experience with a professional organization.  No one answers the phone.  Been a member since the beginning here in Charlotte & can not log in to there website.  Call for help, no one answers.  Terrible company with customer support!"}
{"text":"Let me say...this place is pricey! But I didn't mind.

My family came down for spring break and we decided to come here. I have never golfed a day in my life aside from miniature golf, which we all know...IS NOT THE SAME!

Everyone was so friendly and the man who gave us all of the particulars about how to get set up and play, etc. had us all excited to get started. We ordered drinks and food and just had THE BEST TIME!

I will say that I have a new found respect for anyone who plays golf. They make it look so effortless, it isn't.

The food was great and we really did have a great time and laughing at each other's horrible form. Regardless of the price, I will come back because it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"This place is clearly a man cave kind of things. I mean, yeah, it says golf right in the name, but I had intel that it was supposedly a nightclub/bar/music kind of scene.

Oh well, okay. There were bars, there was music, there was no nightclub in sight, the elevator didn't work and they didn't have heaters at their outside terrace. 

The selection of beer was on par for a man cave, and the people were a strange mix. I totally didn't get the concept.

A+ for the valet, they rocked. Everything else was just too confusing. I recommend this for men, though, because: golf."}
{"text":"This place was so much fun, the waiting areas are even fun! They have corn hole, big screen tvs that show multiple stations. The decor is hip and trendy. Our server was super nice, we got good vibes from everyone. We played on the 2nd level which was the shorter wait and better than being at the bottom level. 

The food was AMAZING!!! We ordered the mushi, which is basically Mexican sushi. It's a chicken, bean, avocado and rice burrito rolled and toasted to perfection, dip it in the sour cream and the hot sauce and it's so yummy!! We ordered the shrimp with the shredded apples on top and that was also incredible! The hot wings were so good too, there were mild and I was able to enjoy them. We ordered dessert, the injectable donut holes. We all agreed that the raspberry injections were the best! 

We initially bought 1 and a half hours of golf but were comped 30 mins because the wait was crazy long that night, so it was 2 hours we got to play. Time went by so fast, we had so much fun!!!! This place was definitely a hit in our books and we would for sure come back!!!"}
{"text":"The idea makes sense.. driving range/bowling concept with games you play.

VIP svc at Mandalay bay hooked this up.  
Tyler was waiting for our groups arrival.. servers are hot n attentive.  It's vegas.. wouldn't expect anything less.

Food and beverage minimums waived.  Top floor charges $100 per hour with f&b minimum of $250. 

The setup is amazing, but at the end of the day, it's a driving range.  Had a few \"biz professionals\" showing off their driving ability next to us..

Food was above par.  I ordered a peanut butter n jelly burger.  Interesting flavor but good.  Both wing orders were on point.

Idk if I'll be back.. probably if it's comped.

Fyi.  Long walk from mgm.  There is a shuttle.. use it n save ur legs"}
{"text":"Well we returned to Top Golf for Father's Day, but we had no Dad's, only someone celebrating their birthday. For the entire weekend, Top Golf added a $50 charge to every two hour reservation, which is a bit sheisty. The first floor is clearly not as fun as the third floor, so avoid the basement, but nothing else was available. Will return on a weekday, non-holiday when prices are normal, non ripoff. 
    Ok, so I really enjoyed the Brisket Grilled Cheese which was a hearty sandwich with some quality brisket inside the bread and two kinds of cheeses. Skip the flatbread and pass on the nachos because they are just eight chips total. The $8 Bloody Mary was pretty good and the chicken sandwich was just your basic bird, but the queso dip was above average. Nothing special about the burger either. I thought Top Golf had a gourmet menu (article I read), but not quite."}
{"text":"This is a really unique driving range. It's got multi levels for both kids and adults. The first two levels are for kids and the upper levels are for adults. I do love the fact that they have so much to do here. Not only do they have great drinks but the food is good. You can play many different types of games on their golf simulator. The facility has many games to play like corn hole, skeeball, and even pools in the uppers levels. The wait staff is extremely accommodating. They have clubs for juniors and women's. Though I would recommend bringing your own clubs if you're a golfer as the club selection is limited. Charisse was our server too and she was really helpful and accommodating. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Great family fun!  Food is amazing and not overpriced.  Great place for kids and/or date night."}
{"text":"I am so happy they finally built a Top Golf in the east valley. The one in Scottsdale is a little far from me. It's nice to have more to do in town. This place is awesome for any type of event or gathering. You have the option to play golf  or just eat, relax and watch. They have a separate place for the kids to play games and an upstairs bar for the adults. The food is amazing and service is wonderful. This is a place for all ages! Definitely recommend to ANYONE!!"}
{"text":"Took the kids while on Spring break...had lots of fun...food was good. We liked the cheaper cost before noon. Staff was really nice and helpful."}
{"text":"So let me get this straight - I buy a membership online, meaning you will take my money, but to be able to play I need a paper card.  Welcome back to the 90's Top Golf!"}
{"text":"A FEW FLAWS with this place...

Reservations are not permitted.  We arrived here before the 5pm \"time change\" in pricing yet Getting through the checkin took 10 minutes and then we found out there was now going to be a 30-45 minute wait!! So now we missed the time and price went up another $15.  WTF???!!  This is why people make reservations.

Pricing is confusing as we weren't sure if it was price per hour or price per person per hour. Haha. 

Aside from all that hullabaloo, the place is pretty cool.  There's a bar and sportsbook in the waiting area as well as 2 GIANT tv screens to view the games.

All in all, it was an awesome time!! Staff was fun and friendly and drinks were fairly priced. Bee will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Not worth it!!! Went for Father's Day, was told it would be a 30 minute wait and ended up waiting over an hour and a half. Meanwhile I watched over 30 bays remain empty the entire time I was there. R u kidding me. They really need to figure out what they r doing."}
{"text":"I was super stoked about this place from the beginning. It brought a new light to golf that was for everyone in the family even if you aren't a golfer. The staff nows how to personalize your experience and make sure that you are well taken care of.

I was very excited to be part of the platinum membership. I have never waited for a bay and the platinum host when they are around remember your name and are always in a great mood  and there to make sure your receive a great experience.

The reason I am only giving them 3 out of 5 stars is not reflective of the staff but more so in the fact that there has been several limitations since they opened with being a driving range.

Since they opened they cut off tee's .... Not a big deal.. Then a month later without any warning to their members they would no longer allow any Driver, Woods, or Hybrids?? Apparently they underestimated the Golfer's in PHX.  SUPER BAD PLANNING.

In order to rectify this for the members the did refund us for one month because of the new rules that went into effect.

However, the following month I was charge with nothing changed. I put a call into the General manager whom I had a conversation with prior, informing her that going fourth I think the way TopGolf handled this situation the new club rules mad me feel like I was a little kid and not trusted, and not informed which we all should of been rather then walking up to the facility and being asked to return our clubs to our cars in the 115 degree weather..

I do want to point out that their are some amazing staff that does work their and makes my 25 minute drive across town worth it!! 

The General manager was kind enough to refund me for another month which I feel I truly appreciated.

It has now been nearly 2-3 months and not much has changed as far as the rules go and in fact seem to of gotten worse..  For awhile now if I brought my own clubs I was again told without any prior information that I would only be allowed to use my own clubs on the bottom floor..

This to me made TopGolf, more of an inconvenience and absolutely not worth the membership.. But I do want to mention again that I was originally charged for this month but then after speaking to the general mgr it was refunded.

I was told that I was see some changes very soon. The only things so far is they changed the balls which now have a horrible and not realistic golf bounce and we are again able to use ONLY OUR IRONS on all floors makes it tough to call this place a driving range at all.. It is still a great place to entertain and have fun but if you are coming her to really practice your game save it for a real course and driving range

I truly love the concept of this biz but because of extremely poor planning and lack of organization I am at the point where if i am not allowed to use my other clubs very soon I no longer feel as though paying out $250 a month is worth the time and effort to go to TopGolf.

Hope they get there act together real quick or else I feel they are going to lose many more fans and members of this great Biz venture."}
{"text":"Definitely a must go attraction if you're visiting Vegas! This place gets packed quickly during the weekends and nights so plan accordingly. 
Parking is such a hassle. Since they don't have a garage they do offer valet for $5 but their valet is extremely small. Since it was full we parked at the MGM garage. I believe the first hour is free anything over 1-4 hours it will be $7. They don't offer free parking to locals anymore.
I went with my boyfriend and friend during March Madness on a weekend. We got super lucky since we arrived around 12pm and our wait time was only half a hour! You can't call to reserve unless you buy a VIP table. Since my group wasn't 21+ we were only allowed on the first floor to golf. While waiting we decided to grab food. I ordered their tacos and side of tater tots. My bf and friend ordered burgers. The food was delicious and the presentation was perfect. 
Since there were only three of us we decided to rent for 1 hour. If you're new to top golf they will require you to join their membership. You can either get a daily membership or lifetime. I recommend getting the lifetime since it is the same price as the daily membership. 
We ended playing three full games during the one hour. I recommend having each play go five times before switching. 
Overall we had a lot of fun and we can't wait to come back here again at night!"}
{"text":"Brian was awesome at top golf as our host. Ask for him if you go....... We had a fantastic time. Highly recommend this guy. Just keep drinking. Vegas baby!"}
{"text":"I've been golfing for decades. This means I've hit balls at driving ranges varying from the run-down municipal necessities all the way up to fancy, all-grass, manicured country club ranges. But Topgolf? This takes things to the next level. I've never done it like this. 

Chipped balls? Computerized leaderboards? Multiple game styles? Up to 5 players per tee? Couches, drink service, and decent food? Yeah. This place is dope. 

Topgolf is not the kind of place I'd go just to practice golf. Too impractical and too expensive. Also too crazy packed. But it's definitely a place I'd go with friends for a couple of hours of fun. Or, as on a recent visit, for something like a team-building offsite. It's so much fun that even non-golfers can enjoy it. 

There's not a lot more that I can say. Make a reservation and go today. I hear one is coming to Portland, Oregon. I'm stoked about that!"}
{"text":"We celebrated our anniversary at Top Golf last night. It was our first visit and it was rad. When we walked in, a girl helped us get memberships and get registered. Then the concierge took us down to our bay, explained everything and made sure we knew not to \"Happy Gilmore\" it. We had a server, Zach, who was FANTASTIC. He kept our beers full and our stomachs happy. We had some jerky people come to the bay next to us, two guys who were super rude to him and he was just nice as ever. He suggested great food, we had the nachos and the bf had the chorizo and egg sliders and he loved them. The only reason this isnt a 5 is because I ordered the house salad with chicken and it was awful. The lettuce was wilted, the chicken was charred black, and it wasn't so great. But I LOVED the rest of the experience."}
{"text":"HOLEY moley this place was rockin. I can't believe how packed it was it was literally shoulder to shoulder everywhere. The parking lot was as full as any mall during the holidays. Driving around and around trying to find a spot and finally giving up and using the valet. It was a Saturday so I'm guessing it was part of the reason and because it's still so unique. But we were on the wait list to play for two hours and finally left. We are while we waited and the food was good."}
{"text":"Relaxed and not rushed, the whole staff is super friendly, clean, good music, and family friendly. I come here often for meetings and bring clients over to talk business"}
{"text":"First time and had a blast here a few nights ago. Very unique and interesting way of making golf a bit more fun. The building is beautiful inside and out. Staff was very friendly and helpful, considering they've only been open a few weeks... Golfed for 2 hours, ordered food and drinks with our server, delivered right to our private bay! Fun and practical business concept, I'd love to go back and I'm sure this place will continue to grow in other parts of the valley."}
{"text":"Was a great time surprised myself with how much fun i had food was ok but the experience was awesome"}
{"text":"Won't be back...place is nice, fun concept, good vibe...prices are high but the locals discount makes it doable with 4 people. Won't go into details but just know if something goes wrong (ie. they run your card for a different party then freeze your card up after multiple tries running it) it won't be resolved quickly and properly. Lots of training opportunities there."}
{"text":"So the golf games are fun, I do wish that it was more high tech. I had a really hard time following my ball so I with the monitors tracked the golf ball while in flight and not just if it hits the target. Now, we only played the topgolf game for a few fours so other games might do that. The food was fantastic, I had the chicken quesadilla and it was probably the best quesadilla I've had so hats of to the chef, we also had a chicken cob salad which looked good as well as chips and salsa. Maybe just a little pricey, between the quesadilla, chicken cob salad, chips and salsa, 2 beers and a sangria it was almost $70. Now let's talk about service, meh, it took about 10 min just to get water, then about 20 more minutes before we saw our waiter again to order lunch and drinks. The food didn't take to long to come out. I just think that our waiter could have checked on us more often than he did. We would have spent more money with drinks but we never had the chance to reorder. It's definitely a entertaining place, just a little disappointed in the table service. The service counter people that greet you were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"First time here... came on Saturday about 10:30 pm. Computers were down, so NOTHING could be rang in. It all had to be a cash deal. Who carries cash these days? Anyhow with a group of girls we ordered drinks... 4 budlights, and a Pinot nor for myself. The bill was $35! Wow? Because the computer was down we had no physical bill in front of us to prove that was the actual amount that we should have been charged. None-the-less drink the drinks came we had a conversation at the bar. The bartender was very nice and had no problems with her humor, professionalism and our conversation. We then decided to get a round of shots for our friends birthday. The bartender suggested orange creamsicles. We all agreed and were told that before shots were $38. Wow. Four shots (not topshelf cordials) were $9.50 each? Expensive!  Anyway we sat there at the bar upstairs and enjoyed ourselves but we were questioning how much the drinks actually were. Upon leaving we ran into several people who were there longer than us because they had large birthday parties. It took them one hour and 40 minutes to cash out. The server they had had no written documentation for what they had ordered so it was a guesstimate on what their bill should be. Then they had no way to physically copy their credit card but had to hand write it. Very unprofessional, they didn't even have any old fashioned credit card swiping machines. I don't understand how companies systems can continually crash and leave the customers in a predicament about paying their bills. Not sure I want to go back...."}
{"text":"We had a great time here. We didn't really know what to expect but it ended up being a great experience. Atmosphere is amazing. And the customer service was phenomenal. We had someone explain the game to us. Another person was our bay waiter and was very attentive. You pay for the bay by the hour and it's hard to judge how long you will need to finish a game especially for your first time. But you always have the option to extend it which is nice. 
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars are that the food options were limited and the alcohol drinks were very much watered down and not worth the prices. 
My suggestion, eat after and just enjoy the game while you're there!"}
{"text":"YELP 100 REVIEW CHALLENGE --- 57/100

TOPGOLF was really fun! At first, I was a little hesitant because I don't golf, EVER. But one swing and I was hooked, and my competitive side really did come out. There are different types of colored holes (large ones) on the floor and they light up. Each hole gets you certain points. The lady who helped us explained that there were different games you can play, but we chose the simple one. It's a great place for the family or a night out with friends. Definitely, a place to try out whenever you're in Vegas. Service could have been better, but I get that they're busy. 

Oh and they have games and a great lounge area to hang out in while you wait for your spot to open. It gets really busy so make that reservation!!"}
{"text":"Great concept and it really has that Vegas vibe. I stay at the MGM Signature a lot and if you're not fortunate enough to get a strip view, your consolation prize is a Topgolf view. My friends and I always talked about trying it out and we finally got around to it this past weekend. When I went on the their website to get some more info, I was surprised that they had several other locations across the country, not to mention some spots overseas. 

We went on a Sunday night and the wait was a bit long, which wasn't unexpected. The top level was closed for whatever reason, the 2nd level had a wait of about an hour and a half, and the bottom had a half hour wait. We were running a little tight on time so we went with the bottom. Although, not sure we would've waited the hour and a half if our schedule permitted it.

It's been years since I've swung a golf club and it was pretty nostalgic for me. There are targets you aim for, and the balls you hit are tracked. The system adds all the players' points up automatically; it's pretty great. Our attendant explained that there were different types of games available, but I think we went w/ the basic one.

I didn't order any food for myself, but my friends got a couple things that I sampled. The nachos were amazing and are on my to-order list for the next time I drop by. I'm going back to Vegas in September and I'm gonna make sure we set aside a couple hours for a Topgolf session."}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect when coming here, but I has a blast! No matter you skill level, the atmosphere makes for a great night with drinks that are deliverd right to your bay! It was snowing when we went but still super warm at our table, which made it a really cool experience."}
{"text":"Would be 5-stars, but it's rather pricey rates (even expensive by golf standards) chop off a star.

I do think they really nail it on the head in terms of what they are trying to accomplish...add some zest and flair to a rather stodgy sport.  Good food, mix it with a kinda bowling alley vibe (but a million times more swanky), and throw in Vegas cocktail waitress and you have a great combination.

Serious golfers, i'd say just leave your clubs at home.  They have (at least in my 3rd floor stall) a very nice set of Callaway XR irons, drivers, fairway woods and hybrids.  Not a full 14 club bag per-se...but all the \"odd\" numbers: 1W, 3W, 3H, 5i, 7i, 9i, and SW...which is more than enough to get by...except for me trying to hit the 90 yard target since that's my Gap wedge distance...which they don't supply.  Back fence is 200 yards out and they only have low tees that you'd use on a 3 Wood (i guess they don't want anyone popping up a driver into the sky and over the fence into Koval Ln).  The chipped balls don't register shots past 200 anyway.  Scoring only occurs when you get a ball in a target...so if it lands on the turf...no stats are provided (bummer).

Service, waitress were attentive and nice.  I was more focused on trying to get the most bang for my golfing buck ($60 per hour at 10am Saturday...imma hit as many balls as i possibly can). Charging this to your MLife hotel room is another plus (yay, tier points!).  

Stalls are not as cool as you were led to believe when they say \"climate controlled.\" They have those nice ceiling heaters for winter time...but in the Vegas summer (it was 107 when we went) the only respite you really get is from the sun...but not the heat.  Spray misters would have been good...heck even cheapy driving ranges have those.  You can dodge the heat and go inside to the bar area though.  

Overall, a wonderful concept, a great vibe...and a super awesome place to go with a group of golfing friends."}
{"text":"Just wow. I was here for a catered event and I have to say the place is amazing. The bays are air conditioned, the food is good, and the golf is awesome. I wish we had something like this at home. It turns going to the driving range into a competitive game that anyone can enjoy even if you're not good at golf!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Yes it is expensive during peak hours but we went midday on Monday and it was perfect. Only $15 a person for a party of three which is very reasonable. It was great too because we had different levels of experience in our group and everyone had a great time. Despite being 106 outside the patio was shaded and air conditioned and we never felt uncomfortable. Highly recommend this for a midday outing!"}
{"text":"Had a great time golfing...good for amateurs as well. Don't bother downloading the app. (Needed to change the channel) 3 of us tried and none of us could log in. Other than that, everyone enjoyed themselves."}
{"text":"While the service was ok, the lack of actual customer services was surprising.  We ordered food and when we were informed that they were going to have to re-cook it, we were not comped additional time. In waiting for the food to arrive, we were almost obligated to continue to pay for bay time. This time should have been comped as the reason for the addition time was due to the mistake made by TopGolf. I understand they are running a business, but this could have been avoided."}
{"text":"This is a must attend spot when your in Las Vegas. Fun, music, drinks, pool and ofcourse golf. The games they have to play makes it fun for all skill levels."}
{"text":"I will never go to this place ever again. I booked a party for 20 people. The week prior to the event several people became sick with the flu. I called the day prior to adjust the reservation. I was told they had already prepped the food so I said I would be willing to pay for the food since it was already prepped. However, why should I pay for golf for people who will not be there. They refused to reduce the price of the event. We were willing to consolidate to fewer bays so they could rent them out to any of the hundreds of people waiting in the lobby to play. They said I needed to give them 7 days notice. How are you supposed to plan for the flu??? I booked the event from 4-6 PM. However, they took the food away at 5:30. So apparently it's ok for them to not stick to the contract but they force it on you even though there was a serious flu outbreak in Phoenix."}
{"text":"There's clearly a reason why Topgolf is always so crowded even though there's three levels of side-by-side bays. Let me start by saying that I am, by no means, a decent golfer...or even a golfer at all: in fact, I don't think I've ever actually been golfing (aside from mini-golf). That being said, I absolutely love Topgolf. Every time I'm in town, I make it a point to come here because the driving range is a blast, the food and drinks are delicious, and everyone has a great time no matter who I go with.

The obvious place to start is the driving range. The way it's set up is a regular driving range but with targets that you try to hit with golf balls that have sensors in them. There are different \"games\" you can play based on your skill level ranging from just trying to hit any target to getting more points for hitting farther away targets to having to hit specific targets. Topgolf supplies all the clubs and balls that you'll need for any of these and that's all included in the price of the bay (but I only use the driver because I'm going for distance, you feel me?)! I've seen people bring their own clubs in as well so feel free to do that if you have a set but I'm not that legit.

The food and drinks at Topgolf are also great and they have a pretty big selection on the menu. I never eat a full meal here but I've had a number of the appetizers and they've all been delicious! You can also order drinks in a light up golf bag-shaped souvenir cup that you get to keep so that's a great deal. The waiters who come to your bay will make sure you're set on food and drinks during your whole visit!

Whether you're a pro-golfer or this is your first time at a driving range, Topgolf is the perfect place to have a good time perfecting your skills."}
{"text":"Love it. Great with family and friends. Service and good good. Club selections is limited. Bringing your own is an option, but inconvenient.  They won't let woods or hybrids anymore. If you play golf, make sure your have a 6-8 iron with you. They may not."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with Topgolf as it was my first visit. 

- They don't take care of locals, probably one of the ONLY places in Vegas that doesn't take care of their own industry people.. I'll make sure not to recommend clients there in the future

- Quality of clubs are pretty terrible. For $75/hr my friend's club shouldn't break in half and the left-handed clubs were made for someone maybe 5' 7\"??

- Service was spotty. Ordered a beer and because it's in an aluminum bottle, it took my server a good 30 minutes until I found her to order another. ALSO! I don't like the pressure of adding another hour of play while I was there. Someone came up to us and disrupted our game every 5-10 minutes asking us if we wanted to add another hour. BUZZ OFF. 

- I guess I just don't understand the entire vibe. There's a pool, there's bar games, there's golf... the problem is there's a million places inVegas that you can do this as a quarter of the price."}
{"text":"Rented a bay for a work event (hosting several customers).....

Facility is wonderful - the menu and quality of food / drinks is fine.

The staff and service were really bad. Very slow to get our initial orders taken and delivered, yet we were repeatedly reminded before and during our event about our minimum spend. 

Multiple servers were downright rude and arrogant (they switched our main server during the event as the first one was ending her shift at 6pm so we had 2). 

We did not hit our minimum spend, which was fine so we figured we would just pay the difference - all good.....but as we were going thru our bill to settle up the server gave me an odd request to allow her to put more items in on our bill because they were running some kind of server contest and it would \"help me out a lot\". She was very rude (when she actually showed up to our stall) to begin with - I just said \"do whatever you need to do - we want to pay our bill and go\". Just an odd and IMO greedy staff, based on our 2+ hours there. 

There was a bus boy that came by a lot and he was very nice and attentive - a shake he wasn't our server! 

I've been to other Top Golf's (ie Atlanta, Dallas) and it was nothing like this. I'm going to chalk it up to the lousy culture of Las Vegas strip - but either way won't be back here again."}
{"text":"We hosted a company event at Topgolf and had a wonderful time - from the food to the games itself, it was fun for everyone. 

The downside with the facility is the lack of air conditioning. Topgolf is an indoor/outdoor terrace with air conditioning, but the air condition struggles to keep up with the intense Las Vegas heat and mugginess from recent rains. For a professional environment, this proved especially difficult to stay looking good and not sweaty among colleagues and clients."}
{"text":"The wait is not that bad just make sure you get here between opening and closing Monday to Sunday. 
If anyone complains about the wait, that's the price you pay for a fun time at a hugely popular place like TopGolf. 
I have played in Japan at the multi tier driving ranges. This is a league all its own. 

The food is what you would expect. The quality of the golfer DOES NOT MATTER. TopGolf is the great equalizer. You come here to have fun or brag and show your skills or lack of, hahahaha.

Go and have a good time with friends and family. The more you have the better the time you will experience. 

What a great time for team building events. 
Office outings. A wonderful low pressure place where all players are great golfers. 

Have fun we did."}
{"text":"Topgolf is nothing short of an experience. It feels like a real life video game and is a blast for anyone who is accustomed to swinging a golf club or not. In addition you can expect decent grub and a wide selection of drinks to go along with a fun evening. It is definitely a place you want to take visitors if they are looking for a unique and interactive experience.

I'll start of with two asterisks: (1) my company has a platinum membership which affects my cost and experience and (2) I have only been during the middle of the day. I've seen the lines get long and heard it can be crazy in the evening, so you can take what I have to say with a grain of salt. That being said, the few times I have been have always been a blast. I am still amazed at the technology of the games. Essentially, you use an interactive screen to navigate different games and when it's your turn, you swipe your golf club over a laser sensor and a ball with a tracker pops out. Depending on where your ball goes (aiming for big targets here), you get points. It's fun to see what you can do and the scoring makes it a lot more entertaining than a driving range. Even if you aren't good at golf (like me), its still a great experience and I find that this place pulls a lot of newbies in so don't worry about standing out.

I had also mentioned the food earlier. I've had a burger, sliders, and chips/guac in the past and everything has been great. Some tips: make sure to get their early if you have never been, you need to get a membership card. Also this place can get crazy in peak hours - but everything lights up at night which is certainly a fun experience. Now go and check it out!"}
{"text":"Had an awesome time. Can't wait to come back.  Just a quick 1 1/2 stop before the flight.  Couldn't get the scoring to be consistent in the shots but probably more the 3rd margarita.  Can't wait to do it again soon"}
{"text":"Golfing is fun service is poor. The waiter at bay 312 at 9pm on 10/14/14 (black visor and wannabe beard) needs to learn customer service. Our machine was down and instead of helping tried to push us to buy food. When we declined and asked if he could have someone fix our machine he gave us lip and walked off and didn't return for our next hour and a half. We paid good money to golf here ($45/he at night) and it's a shame to not even get anything from your waiter... Not even water. Golf was great though we didn't let the help ruin our night."}
{"text":"For the price, I was expecting really solid clubs but instead, the clubs were....old (perhaps 10 year old models). I don't understand why they would give customers such terrible clubs. The staff was super nice but just a weird way to save on costs."}
{"text":"I went to Top Golf convinced I was NOT going to enjoy myself. 
I do not care for golf. Not even mini-golf, but my work was going for \"team building\" and I showed up. 

The cost isn't bad - 35 for a bay, and 5 dollars a person for a card. I personally didn't golf, but the rest of my team did. They all raved about the different games you could play with the \"micro chipped\" balls. 

The food was wonderful, the drinks were plentiful. Originally, we were in a bay where the fan was broken, so they moved us, and it was MUCH cooler. 

The only gripe, is a coworker of mine ordered a burger, and asked for guac - the food runner was convinced the order was \"not right\" (though it looked right!) because of the guac - and the poor girl had to wait an extra 20 minutes while they \"found\" her food. They insist this made a new once since they \"lost\" it - but she was convinced, they brought her the original one. Food runners can be a necessity, but make sure they know people CAN custom order extra toppings."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Recently just had a dirty 30 here and the service was great, golfing was great, music was great, and those ****ing donut balls where amazing."}
{"text":"We had fun here at Topgolf. Beach party gets an individual pay to hit golf balls from on to the driving range. You can also order food and drinks as well. The facility is large and accommodates many people. I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"I've been to TGLV three times now. I have had a great time each time I went. It's very clean, the environment is fun, and trendy. 

You don't even need to like golf to have a good time. Wack some balls around and have a good time with your friends and family! 

Each time I went I had a different experience. The last two times have been within 2 weeks of today. 

The first time I went with my wife for an employee function. They had 2 bays on floor 2 and basically all you can eat and drink. I am on a diet so wanted to get some basic shrimp cocktail. Was not an option. Had to order a $180 seafood platter with crab legs, tiger prawns and 2 lobster tails. It was good but definitely sucks that someone had to pay $180 in order for me to get some shrimp. Thats a major con in my book. Everyone else enjoyed a sushi platter ($110) and a BBQ platter (also around $100). They said it was very tasty. My wife did mention that she had to ask 4 times for salad during this visit but other than that I've found service to be very good. 

Last week I paid for the first time. Walked in on a Saturday about mid afternoon with my wife and parents and they told us 90 minute wait for a 3rd floor bay. We decided to hang out and eat. We went to the beautiful 4th floor, my dad got a couple of beers, wings, and fried shrimp. I'm not sure how much it cost but he did say the wings and fried shrimp were both delicious. 

After 90 minutes passed and we still hadn't been called, we went down to the 3rd floor and I ordered chicken skewers and a beef skewer. They were very tasty but I was a little disappointed I had to pay $40 (including $6 tip) for a few skewers of meat. 

Finally, after a little over 2 hours wait, we got a nice young guy who showed us to the bay and explained how the computer program works. That was a great part of the experience because it was some nice one on one attention. 

The booth was $60 an hour for locals plus $5 each for your first time for a 'membership' (rolls eyes). 

Huge tv's, good music throughout, good service. It's expensive but it's fun. I'll definitely be back and I recommend you give it a shot."}
{"text":"Recently went with the family for a late lunch and some golf.  It was very hot outside and we knew we were \"rolling the dice\" on the temperature inside the hitting bays.  We had never been there in the summer before so we took the chance.  They have great heaters for the cool evenings so we assumed they would have adequate cooling for the hot days too.  Unfortunately, they don't (reason for 4 stars).  They have several large oscillating fans with misting nozzles on the wall behind the bay's.  They are nowhere powerful enough to cool you down.  You find yourself begging for the fan to oscillate in your direction all while you sweat like a hog.  Maybe if each bay had a fan it would work, but getting a breeze every 10 seconds just isn't enough.

The food was great though and our waitress was very attentive as well!  She engaged with us and we had good conversation.  Overall, we still had fun!  We're just going to have to wait until it cools a bit before returning."}
{"text":"This place is like my new fave place. 

The prices change depending on the time of day. It can be a tad pricy but if you go in group setting, it's totally reasonable. You can play for an hour at a time, and you can add after that is up. Or, you can just set a specified time frame. The atmosphere here is fun and it's a good time. 

The food tho, is delicious. I love the mushi. It's a burrito that is cut like sushi. It's delicious. My son loves the donut holes. You get to inject it with flavors. Delicious."}
{"text":"So much fun!!!!! You don't even have to have a history of golfing, compete with the pros and play lots of customized games! Great time for all"}
{"text":"Had a really nice time at a Corp event.  It was catered and the food was pretty good.  Service was really good. And the driving range was a lot of fun.  

I'm not sure how much these places typically cost, but the prices on the board were between 35-45 per hour depending on the level you'll be hanging out in.

At a per person price, I would go again for a dye night or to impress, but an evening out, that is too pricy for me."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last night and it definitely will not be my last!  This place is pretty awesome.  We had people in my party who either have never golfed or were not fans of golfing and they also enjoyed it.  First off this place is huge!  Two pools, five bars, restaurants, tons of golf bays, lounge areas, tvs, and places to chill in general.  Too go along with that, this place is gorgeous.  The views are amazing but being in there just feels cool!  There are so many gorgeous women there, both employees and patrons so prepare to be distracted during your swing!  I thought it would be really expensive but once split between the 6 people we had in our bay, it was totally reasonable.  

I will say though that if you can, and are organized enough, try to reserve a time.  It is ridiculously crowded and when I showed up (Saturday at 8) there was a minimum 1-2 hour wait depending on which floor you wanted to hit on.  Go for the higher decks if you can, as the view is better!  That being said, for how crowded it was, you didn't feel cramped because of how large this place is.  The drinks are pretty pricey though (regular Strip prices) and although I didn't have any food, it all smelled delicious!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at top golf and we loved it! My boyfriend said he had more fun than he expected to. Everyone we met was so friendly. We went before noon so the pricing was the least expensive. We thought $45 for an hour was very reasonable. We got a carafe of mimosas for $24 which is hard to beat in Vegas. We were on the second floor on the end. Apparently the ends are a little less popular, but we thought it was great. Only one group beside us. The bays have couches and heaters, and they play music and have TVs going. You can even make your sports bets there. If you're staying at the signature, there is an outside walkway so you don't have to go through MGM. Just ask at the front and they'll direct you. Give top golf a try!"}
{"text":"I am a platinum member and have frequented different top golf's. Needless to say when the one here \"at\"  the MGM Grand opened I was excited to come. However upon booking a room at the MGM I learned that the property is technically not at the MGM it's behind the hotel off the strip. After getting there we had the worse service. Not only is this top golf considered a higher class the prices are reflected as well which you would think that since it wasn't that busy we would have great service.? Unfortunately that wasn't the case, none of our cards worked for some reason, we didn't get our upgraded clubs til an hour later so we were given  half hour of extra play however, towards the end as we were still golfing the server signed us out of our bay a half earlier so we never got the extra time. My worse experience ever at a top golf, not only is the location unfriendly but the prices are not worth it.  Needless to say I won't be coming back or bringing people whether friends or corporate company"}
{"text":"Fun! But NO \"Drivers, Woods or Hybrids\" are allowed! Should charge 1/2 price for 1/2 service.  ($45 an hr)

{"text":"Perfect place to stop for lunch on a work day. Great food. Watching people golfing makes me not want to go back to work!"}
{"text":"First off the experience begins and ends with Amy V. She was a great waitress who was so welcoming !! She was joyful and had no problems talking to us about the city and the establishment. She gave us great recommendations on the food which were spot on. The steak nachos and sea bass sliders were amazing !!! The staff overall appeared to be very happy and fun. We enjoyed our visit and will definitely be back for more. Thanks Amy and TopGolf for the great experience !!!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place, we have one where we live but this one was attached to the hotel so we gave it a shot. It is fun and I don't golf. They serve drinks and food and have comfy couches for you to sit on. We got the first floor and went on the early afternoon and it was not that expensive. Considering how hot it is here you don't actually notice it, its warm but not that bad. We will try the one in Tampa now. Oh the$5 fee is a one time membership fee and transfers to any other location and keeps track of your scores."}
{"text":"OMG! My first time to Top Golf but it definitely won't be my last! The staff was EXCELLENT! Charlie, John, Nathan, and Alexus did an awesome job with helping me out. Alexus was always on time with everything! The food was good, the drinks were good, and again THE SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT! Keep up the awesome work!"}
{"text":"I freakin loved TOPGOLF in Scottsdale. It was a blast! Think of a huge golf driving range that is high on testosterone. It's got the golf aspect, mixed with the team and competition aspects of bowling, with the scoring aspect of darts.

You get a bay with a computer that tracks where you hit your ball. And there are targets on the range worth various points. Hit your targets and score. 

Besides the golf, they've got crap loads of bars and have all kinds of booze in bottles and on draught. Plus, their food is great too!

Topgolf is a place to have competitive fun, eat fresh food, get plastered and chase tail. It's super popular, and there's 2-3 hour waits on weekends to get a driving bay. Crazy stuff!

Can't wait til one comes to the Bay Area!

5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Keith is the man!! Totally helped us out!! We had a couple people who lost their cards... And he took his time to make it so we can have a lot more fun! Great employee! Made it so we had a really great time!"}
{"text":"The greatest new thing in Charlotte! You don't have to be a golfer to come! It's fun for all! We had a short wait when we arrived and decided to get a drink. Before we ordered we received our text saying our bay was ready so we walked away to wait. It took like 15 more minutes to get the text with our bay number. I just wish when you got the text saying \"it's ready-close out your bar tab\" it was actually time. 

Once we got to our bay we were greeted and given directions. Even after directions it definitely helps if you go with someone whose been there before. It is fairly simple though! You have a server who can bring you food and drinks, a computer at your bay to choose your games and a tv to watch whatever you want. The seating is very comfortable and I love the couch setup. 

It's really easy to keep adding time to your golfing so have a plan before you go in on how long you want to stay/ how much you want to pay"}
{"text":"Ok so you dont need to be an avid golfer to spent a few hours here BUT you'll definitely enjoy it.  Just sitting around lounging, drinks great food! Really fun and the service is always around so you get pampered Vegas style.  We had a lot of fun here and were a party of 14!  They have a LOT of tvs..."}
{"text":"How cool is this place!!!

I was lucky enough to score an invite to the sneak peak event last night, and it was every bit as awesome as it looks online. If you want to know what this place is all about, visit their website and watch the 2 minute video as it provides a great orientation for what TopGolf is all about. 

As an avid golfer, I was really looking forward to visiting this facility. I learned quickly this place is NOT just a place for golfers. It caters to players of all skill levels and ages. You don't even have to pick up a club to have an awesome outing at this place. 

The Facilities: *Hole in One!
The first thing that strikes you is the enormity of the complex - from the height of the nets, to the size of the building and parking lot. Inside everything is very clean and modern, from the seating, to the bar, the private rooms, and the bays themselves. 

The Food and Drinks: *Birdie
This place has the potential to be like Dave and Busters for grown-ups with better food. Here are the items I sampled: 
Mini Potato Skins - *Albatross - By far the best executed of food items. I could eat these every day. 
Mushie - A Strong Birdie - Could have used slightly less cilantro. 
Seared Scallop - Birdie - Would have been an eagle with a little more aggressive seasoning.
Lemon Butter Broccolini - Birdie - Very nice side dish with shaved garlic citrus infused butter. Vibrant and flavorful.
Shrimp Cocktail - Par - Would have been a birdie if all of the shrimp had been fully cooked. The cocktail sauce with diced avocado was among the best I've had. 
Tipsy Palmer - Bogey - I've had better John Daly's. This version fell flat, lacking enough lemon flavor. Would have also benefited from a splash of tonic or sprite. 
Smoked Prime Rib - *Bogey - This sounded so promising, but unfortunately it was a miss. I'm guessing this was smoked at too high a temp for not long enough as the fat and collagen had not properly rendered into the meat which left it tough, chewy, and unpalatable.  

The Equipment: *Par
Each bay is equipped with male and female right handed clubs. Left handed clubs are available on request or you can also bring your own equipment. The irons had the look and feel of super game improvement Callaway clubs with with the TopGolf logos in place of regular branding. Each club had graphite shafts, the men's felt more stiff that a typical regular flex but not as firm as typical stiff shafts. The irons are more than adequate, but the woods seemed to be quite dated - the driver looking exactly like a mid-90s Big Bertha in size and design. Overall, the irons were easy to hit for players of any skill level, but the woods will present challenges to even some mid to low handicappers. 

The Mats: *Bogey
For me this was the most disappointing feature. For a brand new facility, I would have expected mats that had variable lie conditions - firm sections for fairway strikes, and softer longer cut turf to practice softer lies. Additionally, the tees were not adjustable. IMO, they were too high for iron shots, just right for the 3 wood, and too low for driver. They also lacked the ability to hold a standard tee as they we hollow inside. This will likely not bother a novice looking to have a good time, but golfers who join looking to use this as a practice supplement will be frustrated by these items. 

The Games: *Eagle
These were pretty cool. There is a wide variety of different games to choose from. Some are individual while some are team based. The traditional TopGolf game awards points for shots on target, with more points awarded the closer you come to the pin. Think darts with golf balls. Much like a bowling alley, you have a screen where you can type in player info, and select the game you wish to play. Players grab a club and head to the mat where they wave the club over a laser, which triggers a ball to be released. After each shot your score is tabulated and you can switch players by selecting them on the touch screen. There are also games for chipping, driving, and other skill challenges.   

The Cost: *Par (but not one you feel good about)
Bays are rented by the hour and the cost variable based on the time of day. All players are required to sign up for an initial one-time $5 membership. After that, Bay rentals are as follows: Open til Noon = $25 | Noon til 5 PM = $35 | 5 PM til Close = $45. This can be steep if you are playing solo, but if you are in a group of 6, it is much more palatable. The bay rental comes with unlimited balls during your time period."}
{"text":"Sooooo fun! My hubby and i went for his birthday and we had an amazing time. Even though we had to wait it was a fun atmosphere. The food and drinks were great our server was super attentive as well for how busy it was."}
{"text":"Such a great activity to do in Vegas. It's a nice and shady area to get a bit of light exercise and rehydrate. Service is expedient and very friendly. We got a $10 off coupon both times we went through a stand at the front of MGM casino so make sure to find that before you head over. Food was a bit pricy but a good option"}
{"text":"We went here for my dad's birthday. The wait for a bottom floor golf booth was only 30 minutes. They had cool games and large TV's to keep you busy while waiting. They gave us free donut holes for my dad's birthday, which were so delicious. I would highly recommend giving this place a try next time you're in Vegas. The rates get higher per hour the later in the day. But, despite that I would still recommend going at night because the Vegas skyline is lit behind the range! It's an awesome view. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Second time to TG. Had a blast the first time as a Fathers Day gift from the family. We really enjoyed it and looked forward to this visit to now show my mom. This time  we were met at the door by staff advising of a policy change that we cannot use our drivers, woods or hybrids due to possibility if hitting over the net.  Really? You didn't think about that when you built the place?  Assured them that my 86 year old mom would hold back and not launch her 350 yard drives, nor would my wife or I.  Then told we had to leave the woods, hybrids at the desk and if we use our irons we were restricted to the lower level only.   Really?!  What's next?   With all the restrictions we decided just to leave and enjoy a nice dinner elsewhere.   It's really a shame that TG has been reduced to this."}
{"text":"Went here for a buisness meeting with a client. It was a Thursday night, and I was surpised on how crowded it was. I dont like that you cant make reservations ahead of time, so I had to make my client wait when we got there. It seemed to take the girl a really long time to make our top golf playing car, I was just having mine reprinted and my client was getting a new one and it took about 10 minutes just to get our card. Then we had to go over to try to get a lane which he said the wait would be 15 mins. 
We waited at the bar and ordered some drinks and food, thinking we could just take the food to the lane when we got it. Well our lane took a lot longer than he said so we had our food and no where to sit, so it was kind of awkward. The lane took 40 mins. 
With all that being said, the actually game of top golf was awesome! We had a lot of fun, and it was not as expensive as I thought it would be. All in all it was a good time, but I think I will wait till it dies down so the wait wont be so long."}
{"text":"My family went in just over a week ago on a Tuesday night. They were fairly busy and said the wait would be an hour. We played same Corn-Hole and after about 30 mins we were seated. They gave us a quick but informative example of how it all worked and set us up. It was my sisters birthday and shortly after we sat down they brought us these donut bites. They were so good and so very nice of them. We weren't expecting anything at all. The games were fun and even if you suck at golf, like me, you will still have a good time. It is fairly pricy but you can have 8 people per bay. Also if you're a local like us you get 20% off which is awesome. I will definitely be back on special occasions but I will see other driving ranges for the frequent trips."}
{"text":"That time, great food, great golf, even if your horrible and new. Better than bowling and the bar is great. Everyone is so nice."}
{"text":"Be prepared to be treated like an ATM and disrespected. 
This place should have been great. It's an awesome idea and the facility is set up perfect. Unfortunately my experience was terrible.  
This is not a cheap experience and for the $600 I spent to take my 6-8 (some people came and went) friends out for 2 hours I was extremely disappointed. 
I'm not even going to go into how terrible the follow through was trying to get a quote and reservation.  
From the moment we arrived there was confusion about how the time was started and we received almost no instruction on the system. This was not a problem it's pretty intuitive but a few hints would have been nice. For instance once a ball is dispensed you can still change player on the screen, but that previous ball is still logged to the prior player.  
The food and drink minimum policy is ridiculous.  Form the minute we got there we were under pressure to order. Although I wanted to get rounds of beer going I was pressured to order shots because as I was told beer would not cost enough. As soon as we placed food orders and it arrived we were pressured to order more and more shots. I finally got pissed when I realized that after 40 minutes I had spent more time trying to order and deal with the staff than my friends. I asked what the hell all the pressure was for?  I had assumed we could just finish our tab when we got off the lane. Management told me this is not possible, and as soon as our time was up we would be charged and we would be out of time to eat and drink our minimum.  Would could not order anything else without being charge additional. 
In the middle of all of this a staff member we had not seen before came over and turned off our lane and said we were over our time limit. We had somewhere around a 1/2 hour left.  My friends and I were already feeling uncomfortable and this sucked the energy right out of the group. Everyone already had their things gathered up before I could get the manager to figure out what was going on and turn our bay back on. Also the way this individual walked up and spoke to my wife with disrespect made me extremely mad.  We were not credited back this lost time at the end nor apologized to. 
At the end of 2 hours we still had not reached out minimum, I had done very little golfing and I had to take a bag of 10 or so full beers in order to reach our required expenditure. We made lots of fun with our beer bags as the night went on but were made to feel like a joke walking out with a bag of beer at the time. 
If your dedicated to try top golf in Vegas, know that the required food and drink ingestion conflicts with the ability to actually engage in the event. You will have a limited time to make this happen that leaves you almost no time to waste while ordering and dealing with the staff.  We came ready to spend, eat and drink and could not complete the mission. By the middle of out time I was aggravated and feeling disrespected from all the pressures. 
I was not treated as a guest nor hosted with respect while we were there. 
I did not intend for any of my friends to know how much this cost or to care about the money.  Unfortunately it was the main focus of our host and everyone was made to feel very uncomfortable about it. This made ordering more difficult and I was very upset. 
You can find a way better venue to host your friends for $600. Good luck!"}
{"text":"During my recent visit to Las Vegas my friend asked if I wanted to try Topgolf. Its been a while since I've went to a driving range but didn't know that Topgolf was going to be so different than my expectations. Topgolf for golf as Lucky strike is for bowling.

A pay by the hour lounge for you and your friends to play golf in which you hit the balls for score. Food was good, drinks were great, and the concept of a scoring driving range is brilliant. Our hostess did a great job explaining everything to us as it was our first time and she helped us with time management since I felt we were going to surpass our 1hr playing time. 

After golf, we were escorted to their lounge to hang out to finish our food and drinks. Within their lounge were some corn holes, and that became another set of fun for our group. (for free =) )

VERDICT: Rinse and repeat."}
{"text":"Topgolf in Vegas is definitely a hot spot. It's a top place to hang out, eat, drink, enjoy music and hit some golf balls. Great stress reliever by the way!

It is pretty expensive compared to other top golfs but it's vegas, what do you expect?!?! 

Definitely a fun place with a group of people"}
{"text":"Really good drinks, food, service and atmosphere! What a great venue to go to for business or pleasure."}
{"text":"This is now one of my new favorite spots! I'm super competitive so this is perfect for me! Great food, strong drinks and good music! We played on the 3rd floor where the pool is, so not only did we get to play golf, we got to swim! Everything I like in one spot! It gets super packed on the weekends so there can be a long wait...and it's really pricey(just like most things in vegas)  we ordered the dry rub wings with the vinaigrette drizzle, very flavorful and juicy. We also ordered the nachos which were really good! Lots of toppings, guacamole, sour cream, beans, cheese and jalapeños! Yummy! The coconut shrimp was also really good, very sweet and juicy. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My sister threw a surprise party for her bf's 30th here on Monday. She had arranged reservations prior. When we arrived the people at the front had no clue what was going on. When they saw the cake they told us we couldn't bring it in. When it was already negotiated that we could bring a cake in if we paid a $100 fee (which is ridiculous) but it was a special themed $300 cake so my sis was ok with it.  When I first walked in I had a btl water I was drinking mind you its 110dg out and the girl at the door made me throw it away. Excuse me we have a $650 min & are about to spend over $1000 here tonight and you want to bug me about \"A bOTTLE\" of water ? After the chaos at the check in the guy that walked us up to our bay & cabana was informative and nice. Our server this sweet cute Asian girl was super attentive to us. Our biggest complaint is that it's HOT AS SHIT there!!!! It's def not a place to go in the Vegas summer heat. I saw posts stating there's temperature controlled bays and cabanas well that's a LIE because nothing had air coming in unless you went into the BATHROOM!!! We were swearing so bad we had to take breaks in the bathroom standing there to get some air. The pool water was warm. That was the only thing that's temperature controlled. Get it together and put some air conditioning in this place or in the bay's or else I don't think people enjoy sweating their asses off. Other than that the food was absolutely delicious !!!! We ordered the Vegas steak and scallop platter $225 pretty expensive but what do you expect for Vegas? We are locals so we are use to this type of pricing of we wanna step foot on the strip ! Rock shrimp, sea bass sliders etc all were GREAT!!!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't a long wait. They text you when booth is ready. Great atmosphere. Had a lot of fun."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last week. My friend works here and recommended we spend the evening there with a group of friends. We had a blast. From start to finish the customer service was great. The menu had a wide variety of options. The food was really good and was appropriate for the venue. I also like that there are different game options to chose from. I will be coming back to this location again. Plus the view is absolutely beautiful."}
{"text":"First time ever at a top golf and i must say i had a blast. the whole staff was completely friendly and very accommodating for my birthday. The food and drinks were good as well. i definitely will return next time i go to vegas."}
{"text":"Good time.   Better to go as a group with a bunch of people to keep cost down

Made fence higher so you can use your driver"}
{"text":"We love coming here, fun thing to do with the family or as a date! The food is just ok, we usually just order chips, salsa, and guac."}
{"text":"Called the general number three times around 8pm on a Wednesday night as I had a question about their food/drink menu (couldn't find the answer on the website). Each call ended with a recording saying all guest service agents were busy, then the line went to voicemail. I'm happy for them they are so busy to not be able to pick up the phone - but come on. There isn't a single person to pick up the phone?  I don't mind waiting in a queue, but I don't want to leave a voicemail. They lost my business tonight."}
{"text":"As a corporate event planner, Topgolf is great. The facilities are set up perfectly to mix business with pleasure. The meetings spaces are always spacious, well lit, and already equipped to display presentations with A/V. I am disappointed with this Topgolf in particular for not looking carefully for our event materials we shipped there for an event. We were told one of our boxes hadn't arrived after assuring them that it had according to FedEx. After the fact, our box was discovered to have arrived on time. Although I am not opposed to hosting more events at Topgolf locations, my piece of feedback for management is to hire detail-oriented employees  to minimize careless mistakes."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Top Golf before. I am not really a golfer though. However, this place is really neat. The food is actually pretty good! I got the fish sliders and they were really tasty! I love that you can play games or just use it as a driving range. It is pretty cool. Tony (the manager) was wonderful. Very accommodating and nice."}
{"text":"Talk about truly UNIQUE experience in Vegas. I know thinking really?? Just dam driving range when you break it down. But the TRUTH is the place is so so so SO SO much more then just driving range. I know in Vegas bigger seems to be better and all about unique experience. Topgolf hits all the requirements. First impression walking to the front entrance the four story building just massive face value. When you walk in you it like sort of disneyland with each floor had its own personality, or world with different forms of entertainment. The main level walk in (second floor) they have two HUGE wide screens big open atrium area with different seating from lounge seats, bar tables with bar stools, and some face the widesreen or bar tables see people hitting balls. They even have tiny sports book that can play bets on football. I came here with cousins from Portland, OR watch some Thursday Night Football. They even have props bets like Super Bowl that bet who scores the first touchdown, etc... FYI my cousins been to the Topgolf in Portland, OR obviously size no way can compete with this location but even they were blown away by the size. They have bar area on every level. The top floor or fourth floor it more of a true ultra lounge feels with live Dj playing music. Between the fourth and third floor even have swimming pool. The music playing am sure from the Dj but current music and stuff get all party mood or club mood. Crazy. It takes golfing range to another level. 

The golfing part not much of golfer. I meet my cousins for the food but also just check it out. My cousins been to the location in Portland and wanted too see the mother load or battleship of Topgolf. They were not disappointed. They gave me the lowdown on way the golf part works. They take no reservations. It depends on the day of the week and time the wait. Like anything on the strip nothing cheap about Topgolf from food, golf, or drinks. It goes by groups so it actually not that bad when spilt it up with six others. The thing makes it current with high tech experience. All the golf balls has trackers so can literally follow your ball and keep tracks of point if you land it in certain spots. Or hell just enjoy the backdrop of the strip or the massive wide screens that have some sports on. No need brings clubs they provide them. Each driving range spot have nice lounge chairs kick back and server come by if wants drinks or food. 

The food. Honest I had no expectations cause thinking growing up few times went driving range nothing good or memorable about driving range food. Topgolf the food is pretty awesome. We ordered three appetizers to share between three of us. We got the kalbi short rib tacos, Greek Chicken Skewers, and Topgolf Wings (mango habanero). They were all amazing!! I would recommend all of them. The Skewers not only was the chicken cooked perfect but the tzatzaki sauce that was the key. It brought the whole dish together, The kalbi short rib tacos was my favorite of the three. Not only was the kalbi the da bomb. I could just have whole plater of kalbi. Instead of taco shell use steam bun. So more cross from peking duck with steam bum. It was so good. The Topgolf wings they have few different sauces choose from. Mango Habanero it has nice late kick. Be warned! The carrot and celery stick or not stick but peelings. Weird. I would have preferred regular traditional carrot and celery sticks. The wings were solid. The menu not that big or crazy. I like that fact. It simple food some of it take another level. 

No doubt if looking for something different to do and with group or small one. Topgolf is great spot. It comes to parking I parked at the MGM parking lot and walking  down the street. The parking lot or valet for Topgolf not that big. If the lot full pretty much nightmare/"}
{"text":"What a fun place! We had our company Christmas party at top golf and it was a blast. We were me outside at the door and directed where to go which was a bonus. We had at least 3 servers who were lightning fast bringing our food and drink orders. There was inside and outside seating for our party and heaters outside if anyone got cold. Perfect place for a party or if you are looking for a place to take a group. All in all, great time."}
{"text":"Oh Top Golf, you are over the top in general, but then you had to go all Vegas on me. 

I think this is a fun place to go with out-of-towners or your local friends for something different. Drinks and food are pricey, but worth it. The bay rental is reasonable since you can have up to 6 people...if only I had that many friends...

I've been several times now, first time was a Yelp/Media preview night which was lots of fun. I then got my team at work to do our quarterly outing there and then took my folks when they were in town. Each time has been different but awesome. 

I suggest renting a bay higher up, yes it costs more, but at night the view is awesome. I have yet to check out the pools, cause to me it just feels odd to swim there...maybe next summer.

Big selection of beers and cocktails, the food was catered each time so I can't comment on ordering food. Check it out, bring some fun people and enjoy a driving range right next to the LV Strip."}
{"text":"Omg I love this place! You can golf, eat, drink, and swim if you choose to. We had wings and the wedge salad and it was delicious! Perfect for the day or night fun. For all you golfers this is the place to be. Cheers everyone !"}
{"text":"I love top golf! I have been here a few times and enjoyed each time.  The food tastes decent too. It is perfect to come with a group and order drinks and appetizers. It is much more expensive at night but it is a fun environment in the dark.  All of the staff always are super friendly.  I hope to become a regular here!"}
{"text":"Seriously cool place to male-bond! My first time to a TopGolf and I was blown away. A great concept, and good customer service and decently priced food & drink. Got my golf fix in. This appeals to golfers of all levels, especially hackers like me. An hour split 3 ways saved me $200-300 from playing in the casino."}
{"text":"Had a birthday party and rented 3 bays with food and drinks. (I didn't pay so not 100% on cost ) The service was amazing, our server was exclusive to our party and made she we had the food and drinks we needed. Our party ranged from 11months -60 years old, everyone had a good time. The seating is very comfortable, tv screens to watch the game, and amazing technology to keep score. Only bad thing was finding a parking spot. Good luck with that on a weekend next time I may just use their valet service."}
{"text":"Top Golf management has reached out to me very professionally and promptly to address the negative experience we had regarding the service we received.  They have promised to address the tipping situation with the employee, and corrected multiple billing errors on our tab. They have also promised us a much better experience if we return. 
I am changing my review to 3 stars for the prompt and attentive manner in which management has attempted to right the wrongs.  
I will review and update our experience when we return to the venue. As I love supporting local amenities, I hope our return experience will be a 5."}
{"text":"Had a good time once we finally were given a spot. We were put on a 2 hour waiting list! So we decided we would go eat and hang out until it was our turn. 2 and 1/2 hours later i asked where we were on the list. The lady said there were 7 groups still ahead of us due to them making reservations online. They decided to have us wait for 2 1/2 hours before telling us that we were going to keep getting pushed back. Finally at about the 3 hour mark we had a spot. Manager had to fix our ball machine twice. Manager and server were great! But the system was a bust. 3 hour wait to play for a hour and have the thing break down twice."}
{"text":"Cool concept. Service sucks. Server waiting 20-30 min in between he king in on us. Had an opportunity to make major sales off us and was too lazy to care it seemed. They used Windows and tray holders, looked sloppy. Staff seemed to be on the suck up side. Staff doesn't give you that \"you're welcomed here\" feeling"}
{"text":"Although this place is quite on the pricey side for two people, it is a great time. Their Bloody Mary's are fantastic! They have great brunch specials as well. The view both during the day and at night is spectacular. Great for company that is visiting out of town!"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend Top Golf Las Vegas for an evening out with a big group of friends. Go at night (although its a high rate per hour to play in the evening peak hours) I think its worth it with the view. People of all levels and people who have never played golf before can play. If they are super anti golf they can find fun at the pool, or other games that top golf has. 

Attire is kinda weird at top golf - depending on the time that you go some people get really dressy in the evening and some people look like they are going to a night club others are super casual. But there is no dress code that I am aware of so just wear what you want.

Also the food and drinks are pretty darn good! They have a drink that comes in a golf bag shaped drink glass that lights up. ITS REALLY COOL and all your friends will be jealous !!

Pro tip-  You can bring your own clubs if you don't want to use the callaway clubs that they have and if you have time, remember to bring your golf glove !"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the experience at Topgolf and would definitely go back again! Everything is still so modern and new since it was just opened last year. I arrived with my father and we decided to play two hours in the morning as it's much easier to get a bay in the morning vs. evening. Getting started was fairly easy although having to pay $5 to get a players card was a bit steep. There was a gentlemen that directed us to a bay on the 2nd floor.

We played a variety of different mini games and each one posted interesting challenges for us to overcome. I also saw the games room downstairs and that looked like tons of fun as well. It seems like a great place to go with a group of friends whether or not they are golfers it doesn't matter at Topgolf."}
{"text":"Good place to hang out with friends. Polite staff. The place was very clean. Had outdoor mister fans to help with the heat. Never have played golf so I was pleased that I could even hit a ball. Overall...would definitely recommend! Had a blast.."}
{"text":"Has to be favorite hang out spot.  Golfing bays, pools, cabanas, bottle service, live music, bars, tvs, they've got everything you need.  I enjoy most of the food items as well.  My favorite would be the shrimp.  You can watch sports as you hit golf balls.  Their tv placement is awesome.  It is fun at night when the music feels like a nightclub and the holes flash to the music.    Open to all ages.  

Stand behind the red line, before someone's golf club knocks you out.   The golfing space should probably be wider.  They've got golf clubs for lefties, upon request."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I took a group of 6 and half the group has never golfed. Everyone loved it and would go again if there was a local to us. This place has a nice semi-upscale atmosphere but still casual. The only reason it's not five stars is because if the $5 membership, especially since we're not local.  The service was excellent. One other weird thing is the online VIP pass. It's confusing to order and they made it sound like I needed it if I didn't want to wait an hour (I called). We got there at 7 and there wasn't a wait so we saved the VIP pass. Other than the confusing things we loved the place."}
{"text":"This is an incredibly fun outing but unfortunately the Food and Beverage management is very weak. 

Terribly understaffed for the volume of business that they do leads to a ton of waiting and poor service."}
{"text":"I have been to top golf several times and it is a really fun place, great location, atmosphere etc. With that said, top golf has one continuous problem that people have mentioned in other yelp reviews.  
- if you are going to have a first come first serve facility you have to make sure someone answers the phone to book large parties . No one ever answers the phone and it's impossible to know if there is a wait . Driving all the way to top golf and finding out the wait time is close to 2 hours is ridiculous. 



It's an awesome place, and a great concept, but I think everyone would appreciate better, consistent customer service ."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places. I am a terrible golfer and now even a huge golf fan, you don't have to be to have a good time here. Great fun, great snacks and yummy drinks! The 3rd floor has a private bar and dancing! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Beware of this place the workers are rude and if you even question why 4 \"bays\" have been open for 30 minutes and you are quoted a 3 hour wait time, you are told \"trust me I work here every day, some one is coming\" I hope you never get this type of service. Poor customer service. Don't believe the hype, most of the people on here are probably paid to say good things..."}
{"text":"How much fun is this place?  My husband's company management has been talking about doing a corporate function here so we thought we'd stop in and get the membership cards out of the way.  I love that there was a woman up front to greet us and guide us where we need to go.  Byron took excellent care of us at the membership counter and he's a fellow Iowan and Hawkeye fan so he's got my vote for Employee of the Month.  

Then we walked around and checked out everything.  We really liked how roomy each section is with plenty of seating and a couple of TVs.  The range looks like a lot of fun with a variety of targets, and I also noticed how clean everything was.  

We cruised through the bar and noticed there are some large booths with their own TV so you can sit with your group and watch your game of choice.  They also have a gaming area for those not swinging a club.  There were a lot of staff around and they were smiling and making sure people had what they needed, or answering any questions.  

While on the way to the restrooms I noticed they have some meeting rooms and one group had booked one for their fantasy league draft.  We got a look at their catered food of wings and some other munchies and it all looked and smelled delicious.  I didn't snag any as I walked by, I swear!  

Even though my golf clubs are only in the house as potential weapons now and I call myself a reformed golfer, I would definitely look forward to a corporate event or night out with out-of-town guests at Topgolf.  GREAT place!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed it even with a bumpy beginning. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place has golf and a full bar. It's good for decent sized groups. Prizes can range from $40-$90 an hour. Definitely gets packed at night."}
{"text":"Great concept and potential. Service was spotty at best and not cheap I.e. $40 for a bucket of 6 Coors lights! We were first told about 45 minutes but ended up waiting closer to 2 hours none-the-less once we got in our bed we all had a really good time"}
{"text":"Love  this place.   Great  concept.   I don't even play  golf , but have found myself here almost weekly since my first time.   Great for groups!!!!  More relaxed than actual golf and more like a game and you can build on actual golf skill"}
{"text":"I was given a gift certificate for Top Golf so when my boss, who used to play on the PGA tour, was in town, we decided to try it.  We had a lot of fun and the food was really good.  When our hour was up, we were finishing our last sips of beer.  Within 10 minutes, 3 different people told us to get out of the range.  They weren't even nice about it and since we spent well over $100 for the hour, I thought it was pretty rude.  When we left, I asked to speak to the manager.  He said they had a lot of people waiting.  They only had 2 levels open so it is \"his\" problem, not mine.  He was just as rude as the other people and really didn't care if we came back or not.  I won't go back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, my wife and i had the time of our life,  the customer service was second to none, i will be back for my birthday in Aug.  I recommend this place to any and all"}
{"text":"Super fun spot! My son always asks if we can go when we are in AZ. We really need one of these in Vegas. Its a chill spot to go with family, have a fun night out with friends or just by yourself to hit some balls, major stress reliever. The atmosphere is fun and exciting, lots going on.  Been here a few times and always left very happy!

Unfortunately, this last visit our service was short of horrible. We sat at the bay for almost 15 min before I finally tracked down someone and asked for our server. What made it even worse was the table right next to us (5 males) had been checked on by same female server 3 times (when we started counting) without even acknowledging us, imagine our surprise when we realized that same female server was the one who ended up attending to us before passing us off to yet another server (who BTW was actually really great). (-1 star for service)

Guess its a good thing people don't go to topgolf for the service."}
{"text":"Topgolf is honestly great for any occasion and you don't need to be a great golfer to love it. Think bowling but golf! Whether you need a fun place for a corporate outing, birthday celebration, bachelor party, retirement party, you name it, this is your place! Not only is the golf fun, but their food and drinks are spectacular as well! (Usually at these types of places, the food is 'eh' but not at Topgolf!!) 

We came here for a company offsite and EVERYONE had a blast. I personally, am definitely not a great golfer (like, i'm lucky to even make contact with the ball), however, I was still able to score some points and most importantly, laugh and mingle with my teammates. The balls have a micro chip in them so that they can keep accurate scoring. We nibbled on delish appetizers like shrimp cocktail, antipasto skewers, pot stickers, and queso. Their Moscow Mules are also on point (and yes kids, they come in a copper mug here!). 

I will most definitely be back for another fun occasion, or even just a date night, again soon!!"}
{"text":"We went here Saturday night around 7:30 and the line was out the door. There was a little snafu in getting our bay but I won't dwell on that too much because the manager, Rob was quick to respond and make it right. We went there for my husbands birthday and had great service at our bay and had lots of fun! We Will definitely be back for the food, drinks and fun!"}
{"text":"Great concept and design.  2nd visit.  Whoever is in charge of hiring servers should be fired.  Very bad attitudes walking around and when we had the nerve to ask if we could get some service the girl gave us a very rude look.  Not the Vegas friendly atmosphere you should expect."}
{"text":"Best entertainment venue in Gilbert by far. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The food is great, but the golf is what keeps bringing me back! Great for a date night, guys night out or to take the kids."}
{"text":"Stopped by Topgolf again on our recent trip to Vegas for the 4th of July holiday. This time we went early since it's only $30/hour before 12pm (M-Th). I think locals get an even better deal so if you know someone that lives local, bring them along too!

Since our kids were with us we had to go on level 2, but was fine since level 3 has more of a pool party / club atmosphere (makes sense I guess since they do have a pool / cabanas on that level). It was pretty hot the day we went so towards the end of our 2-hour session, it got pretty uncomfortable. I see that they have heaters by your sitting area and where you actually take your swings (each bay has their own to control), would be a huge improvement in the summer if they also had air conditioners there as well.

Our kids split the kids portion pizza, which came with a side of their choice. My girlfriend and I split their BBQ pork sliders, which were just ok. I think they could improve their draft list of beers, Lagunitas is the best one they had. 

Overall, we still enjoyed our time at Topgolf, provides a good alternative option for an activity to do while in Vegas that's not the pool, clubbing, or roaming the strip. We'll definitely stop by again when we're in town.

P.S. I think it's crazy that they don't have one in Southern California yet (SD / LA area)"}
{"text":"Overpriced for sure. Inconvenient parking. Waitress idiotic. Ending up waiting for an hour for our \"reservation\". Computer ended up freezing so we lost over half hour of play time. Then waitress ran our card for someone else's bill. 
Whole experience was frustrating."}
{"text":"Awesome place .. Always crowed so  be prepared food so good  and good drinks waitress we had was on it.."}
{"text":"Great time! Great food and the price is right on target. I have been here several times with my company and loved it. Recently brought my younger boys and their friends to hang out ages 11-13 and we were treated as any other guest. Drinks flowed, food was good, host was awesome and we had a really good time playing and hanging out."}
{"text":"Top Golf is awesome. I'm not even a golfer and had a lot of fun here. It is definitely a different experience than I've ever had at a driving range. It's kind of set like a bowling lane where parties have their own area sectioned from others but with comfy seating. If you want something just call them over. Get me more drinks, more food, a friendly face, etc. There's no buckets of balls all you have to do is wave your club near some sensor and a ball rolls out. Unlimited balls for the time you play! 

One thing that stood out each time I've driven by were those huge tv screens on the other end of the driving range. They are a lot nicer now that I've seen them from inside of TG and very clear even when the Sun's out.

There's three floors of driving ranges. The 3rd floor costing the most. I don't remember the prices but there is a local's discount thats better than printing that coupon TG offered online.

On the 2nd floor they have an area with more huge tv screens to watch whatever games are on. They also have cornhole game. I'd use these before or after you're  done with the driving range since you're paying for the range usage.

We were on the 3rd floor which has what seemed like a pretty big bar and sweet swimming pool setup. It's getting cooler now so I'm not gonna use that pool unless perhaps I lost a bet and had to jump in butt naked jk. You can look down into the 2nd floor tv and cornhole area from up here. There's a 4th floor which I'm guessing is lounging area since 3rd floor was the top floor for the driving range. I didn't check it out.

The food was surprisingly good at least from what we had. We ordered the grilled backyard wings and a flat bread but the rest of the menu included items like kalbi short rib tacos, sashimi, pulled pork sliders, and more.

Back at the driving range they have heater controls so if it's too cold during the winter turn up the heat  Also for those like me who aint that good at whacking the balls for distance there's a game where your earn points based on accuracy, closes to various targets/holes throughout the range. It keeps it pretty fun and competitive among the party. Of course I won.

Yeap I'm definitely going back soon. By the way the environment is some what loud with music and people having a good time. My kind of place."}
{"text":"I came here last Sunday with my family to celebrate my dads bday and we had a great time! Even though it was hot out, they did a good job keeping it cool out where you hit the golf balls and eat. We ordered the pretzel bites for an app and they were good. I ordered the mushi and tater tots for my meal and they were also good. Oh, and I ordered a sangria but I didn't like it very much, so I would not recommend the sangria. Other than that topgolf is a fun time!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, food and games! Such a fun date night or a night out with friends! All staff are very helpful and knowledgeable. There are several games to chose from which keeps it fun! Cant wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"The venue is awesome just like their other location in Scottsdale. Mostly everyone is pretty friendly but I had a bad experience with one particular server. 

I ordered a beer which I didn't like and wasn't going to say anything, however another server noticed my face after I took a sip and immedietley offered to switch it out for me. I accepted and told her I wanted the summer shandy...the L name one. So she said the L name and the server, Sarah, who was rude came and told it's an IPA. Being a beer novice, I said ok. Well it wasn't what I wanted but I kept it because I ordered it. 

Later Sarah comes back to see if we need anything, and my BF says she didn't like this beer. She responds well she ordered it, we told her it was an IPA I was here. Seriously? I'm wasn't arguing with her, I told her I would keep it.

Then when it came time to pay, my bill was charged to someone else in our group. I tell her and she asked for my card, even though I had already gave it to her to open the tab. I tell her I want to pay cash, and she said the bf said I wanted to pay with a card. I said no cash...and she still questioned me. 

Finally, since we were done playing she asked us to move to the lounge area. I didn't understand it since it was a Tuesday night and there were TONS of open Bays! 

Mostly it was misunderstandings. But I really dislike when servers question what the customer is asking for."}
{"text":"This place is a pretty awesome place. I've only been here once on a Friday night. The music is loud, the drinks keep coming, and you get to practice your swing.  I think I love this place."}
{"text":"Great place with a great concept and great food and beverage. Disappointed that our bottom TV never worked and there was very little effort to remedy the issue. As long as there isn't a problem you will have a great time here"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Fun to party with your friends or bring the kids. Best of both worlds. Foods good too!"}
{"text":"Holy moly this place is awesome! Saturday was my first adventure to Top Golf and I'm amazed at how cool this place is! We were here for a 50th birthday celebration and it was all that and a bag of chips! The server was great, golfing was fun and the food was exceptional! My friends are a little extra and ordered everything from shrimp, lobster and king crab platters to tacos, wings, fruit, and fried doughnuts! It was almost top notch restaurant quality. 
Keep in mind, this place ain't cheap, golf costs $$ we were apart of a private party and all food was included but I can only imagine what the food pricing was with such great flavors. We paid $30 for a 6-pack of beers and most cocktails seemed to be in the $10-$14 range. There are enough TVs to fill every sports fan desires not to mention cornhole and table tennis."}
{"text":"I love coming to topgolf! Even if your not great at golf you can still have a great time. I love coming at night cause the lights change as well. 

Came here a week or to ago and wanted to play around 7:30pm and it was a 2 hour wait. So we left and I scheduled a bay online for 6:30pm and when we got here it was quick and easy. They sent us to our bay right away.  When we got up stairs and found our bay there was someone there to help us. We swiped our playing cards and there was 4 time slots you can choose from to play 1) 30 mins 2) 45 mins 3) 1 1/5 mins 4) 2 hrs. We chose an hour & half. We got to play 3 1/2 games but there was 9 of us. 

We ordered the 24 injectable doughnut holes & you can pick 2 creams. We choose bavarian cream & chocolate. They were both really good. Also we ordered the signature nachos it was so delicious & definitely not enough for all of us that we had to order another one. 

They have seating up stairs. They have games like pool & Kinect & etc."}
{"text":"Was worth the wait! Had so much fun. Recommend just renting a whole bay for a couple hours, up to 6 people can play!"}
{"text":"We went to the pool. There is no cover charge & free lockers. We had a great afternoon hanging out. There is a bar right there that has a swim up side.

We went on a weekend & there was a DJ all afternoon. The demographic was mostly people in their 30's & 40's, & the music was aimed at that age group. 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome concept. Really fun way to hang with friends. Server Dakota - the man!! Kept the drinks coming!!! #dakota"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to come whenever I'm back in Arizona! Been coming to Top Golf for a couple years now, it's always a blast whether you know how to play or not! Be sure to come with a group and you'll barely put a dent in your wallet. The food is not incredible but good nonetheless. The Mexican sushi is one of my favorites here, give that a try! The wait can be long so be ready to wait up to an hour before a bay is open!"}
{"text":"Any time my husband wants to celebrate anything, his first suggestion is Top Golf. We always have a great experience and have a fun filled time. Last night was no different. We chose to go to Top Golf as part of our anniversary, and we had an amazing time (as usual). This time, however, we were pleasantly surprised with the amazing service and friendliness displayed by many of the Top Golf employees. Our server at the bar kept the drinks flowing and provided outstanding service. Additionally, Michelle (I think she was a shift lead of some sort) made us feel at home and really made our night special. Overall, a fun place with delicious food and drinks and even better customer service."}
{"text":"Great experience! Staff was extremely knowledgeable, helpful and personable. They have three level banks to hit balls from. There was a much longer wait for the top two so we went for the level 1. It's a little cheaper, but I would definitely want to do an upper level next time. Upper levels give you a better view, and if you're not as good of a golfer, you ball is at a better angle and goes further. . We were quoted 45 min but only waited 20. They have lots of games you can try. Food and drink menu is decent. We went in February and the heaters make it feel like you're not even outside. We were comfortable in our t shirts. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The operations manager Brian saved our night. Our group sat at the bar to order food while we waited for our bay... Everyone's good came but mine... To say the least, I was Hangry! They brought my food right away and also got me a free drink! Love love love the customer service. Wish getting a bay was easier."}
{"text":"Top golf is great.  Michelle (managerfrom Boston) is awesome.  She made EVERYONE in the group feel welcome.  Misa was the waitress and she was great.

I will be coming back soon
PAM"}
{"text":"This place was great when it first opened but has since gone steadily downhill. I had brought some friends for a round on Monday night when the place wasn't very busy. First off there was only one person at the register and a line of people. Meanwhile there are 4 employees talking it up over by where you check in for a bay. After waiting 10 minutes to get my buddies signed up for cards we check in and are told it would be 2 minutes for a table to be bussed. No big deal. We decide to grab some drinks at the bar but no one is there to take an order, we keep waiting until my friend goes down to the other end to tell the guy hey we wanna buy some beers. No menu was given so we didn't know the beer list. We ask the guy what IPAs they have? He says only one and the one he names isn't an IPA. We decide to look at the taps and see that there are like 3 IPAs up there. Either the guy didn't know anything about beers he was selling or it was his first day cause every question we had he had to go down the bar and look then come back. Back and forth. After about 15 minutes of that horrible beer experience I ask the girl if our table is ready, she fumbles around on the computer and I like oh yeah sorry it's ready. I think if they weren't so busy talking to one another they could have showed us our bay way earlier. It seems like everyone that works there is just standing around and collecting a paycheck. Clearly the management skills in this establishment need to be worked on cause if I run my business the way these managers do I would be out of business. I don't plan on coming back anytime soon and feel sorry for my buddies first experience here being a lousy one."}
{"text":"Some friends and I went to try to get a bay the other night and the guy that helped us to get our card was completely rude! I love top golf but the cashier just made me want to not want to come back again, I get it you're busy and maybe tired but he didn't answer our questions and just made the whole experience for me and my friends unpleasant, hopefully the next time we go back the experience is better"}
{"text":"So excited to be a part of this amazing team! Never seen anything like this place! You will never want to leave.... So much to do!"}
{"text":"I had a good time here. The staff was nice. The beer was cold. The environment is fun. Golf/bowling concept works. It costed about $70 for an hour with 3 ppl but its vegas and nothing is cheap. An hour was enough for us. Starts getting tiring and blistering. Fun time!"}
{"text":"I had 0 expectations for this place and I had a great time!  I'm not a golfer but how they have everything set up with their computer system is really amazing.The thing I really wasn't expecting was how good the food was; everything from the nachos to the prime rib was delicious.  I would go back there in a second!"}
{"text":"This place is weird. It's like a nightclub for golfers. I don't get it. It was a strange mix of families, drunks, golf nuts, teenagers and people celebrating random occasions. Is there really NOTHING else to do in Gilbert?"}
{"text":"After hearing about the magic of Top Golf from friends in DC, I was curious to know how it would stack up against their experiences. Going on a Friday at noon, our group anticipated being able to go straight in and get a bay. As we drove up and saw almost every parking spot filled, we quickly realized it'd be a bit more complicated than that. Check-in was fairly simple; first-time visits require you buy a $5 member card that you use at every Top Golf location in the country. We availed ourselves of the spacious bar area while we waited on a bay to come open. Prices are fair, and the beer is cold. Once our bay came open, an attendant escorted us to it, helped check us in, and we were on our way. Wait staff tended to us throughout the afternoon, and both the drinks and food were good. The golf in and of itself is great fun, with a variety of modes available for everyone from beginners to scratch golfers. They could do with some better fans to keep the air moving during the summer, but it did little to dampen the mood."}
{"text":"Whether you love golf, hate golf, or just suck at golf (I'm pretty much all three), this place is a blast.  I came here with my siblings for my Dad's birthday upon a recommendation from a co-worker.  Even my sister who never plays golf had fun with us here.  

Its not a course mind you, but a driving range with various targets located throughout the range.  The targets are situated at various points from as close as 50 yards to as far as 225 yards.  So no matter what clubs you use or even if you habitually duff your shots, there are still plenty of opportunities to get points.  You can bring your own clubs or rent clubs there.  You pay for a bay at the range by the hour (price varies depending on the time of day) and a computer terminal helps you set up whatever game you want to play with your friends.  We just went with the TopGolf game so we could just let it rip wherever we wanted.  The staff there are incredibly friendly and helped us with any questions we had.  Total cost for a two hour session at our bay on a Saturday morning was $50.  You also have to pay a $5 membership card fee if this is your first time here (once you have your membership card you never have to pay for it again).  Altogether we paid $30 in membership fees.  So split between 5 of us (we didn't let my Dad pay obviously) the total cost per person for our time here was $16.  Considering some actual golf courses charge that much for a single bucket of balls on their driving range, a pretty solid deal.

The driving range has three levels so there's plenty of space (though it was getting busy when we left).  Its shaded and has swamp coolers so its still useful during the summer.  There are also bars at each level serving booze and you can order food from your bay or at the sports bar downstairs (we didn't order any food this time).  If you have a big party or corporate function you could seriously spend hours and hours enjoying yourself here.

In the end my family had a great time and actually my sister beat most of us despite having little golfing experience.  Mark my words, I'll get her back next time."}
{"text":"I'll start this off by saying I'm not an English major but I'm a business owner. With over ten people in our group one person acts out of line they punish everyone. Not happy with how the manager handlers the situation."}
{"text":"Fun thing to do with friends or family. 

Your first time walking in is VERY confusing. You have to stand in a line to purchase the $5 lifetime membership which requires getting a players card set up. After that, you have to go to another line to reserve the bay. The signage isn't helpful at all in explaining what you need to do. If your lucky, someone walking around with an iPad will approach you and you can get signed up for the players card that way. If going with a group, I would suggest that everyone is already signed up for the membership card prior to going. Also I wouldn't recommend going on a Friday or Saturday night unless you want to spend 2-3hrs waiting for a bay to open up. 

It's easy to see why this place is happening on the weekends because it is addicting and fun. You could easily spend 4-5hrs here. Bay rentals are $45/hr but if you split it between everyone playing it really isn't that bad. They don't take reservations, but once you arrive you can check in and get your name on the list."}
{"text":"It's good to call in before you go to see what their wait times are. There are 4 levels of topgolf, levels 1-3 are open to the public. Level 3 is 21+ only. So yes, they are kid friendly levels 1 through 2. Level 4 is reserved for events/big parties, you could call to reserve it or do it online. Level 1 is downstairs and level 2 is on the first level of the building once you enter. They have a full bar on the main level with their own topgolf drinks! You can get a 30oz or 60oz in a topgolf cup. The 60oz lights up and comes with golf club straws. No lid comes with it so  be careful not to spill! Their crispy shrimp was yummy. But to be honest, the crispy outer layer is what made it good, they shrimp was small and could be fresher. I personally wasn't a fan of the 7 layer dip. It comes with frozen cheese on top. And the mango habanero wings, if you've had mango habanero wings from buffalo wild wings, then it does not compare. They just be more flavorful and have more of a spicy kick to it."}
{"text":"Ladies, if you want a man to completely fall in love with you, learn to hit a golf ball! The first time I ever hit a ball of the tee my husband literally turned to me and said \"honey, that's the sexiest thing you've ever done.\" It's that simple...

Came to TopGolf for a company offsite and was totally blown away by its sheer size and awesomeness! Three humongous stories of driving range stations that would make any avid golfer drool with anticipation. I'm from Honolulu where we don't have anything remotely this cool in a PGA fanboy meets Vegas bottle service kind of way. I learned to golf a few years back so that I could play in a tournament and I've always been grateful that I at least know the basics. It was so much fun to hit the ball off the tee and watch the points rack up on the screen. Out of all the team building activities we've had, this is definitely my favorite because of the physical activity and fantastic food + drink. Even if you're not big into golf, it's cool to hang out and lounge on the couches while watching your teammates play."}
{"text":"Fun for everyone in the family. We love taking friends and family from out of town there.  I actually really like the food selection also. They have good snacks or full meals.  My kids have so much fun every time we go. It would also be a good place for an adult gathering like a Birthday or even company party. Even if you aren't a \"golfer\" you will still have fun."}
{"text":"We arrived at 4:15 on a Wednesday so it was busy but not like a weekend. Service was horrendous. We waited about 20 minutes for a server. I finally asked an employee who said he would find a server and send them over. Another 5-10 minutes pass and still no server. There were a ton of employees passing through but no one even looked at us. I headed upstairs to find a manager and finally they sent a server to our table. The manager said \"they had been going through a transition\". 

Finally ordered food. My husband ordered chicken wings and he said they were the worst wings he had ever had. One of the pieces did not look like any distinguishable piece of chicken I had ever seen. 

When we went to golf, the server was no wheee to be found. I asked another one how it worked to transfer the ticket. He told me to come back after we knew what bay we were assigned to. I did and the waitress had already closed out the ticket because she assumed we left.  Another hassle to get the ticket reopened. 

The golf was not scoring properly so we had 3 different staff members troubleshooting throughout the time. 

Overall, the concept should have been fun but they need to train their staff and add a lot more customer service skills. We will not return."}
{"text":"So much fun at such a great price!! 

This place is a nice way to relax, be competitive and also have a lot of laughs with friends and family! 

We all aren't golfers so it took golfing to a whole other level! Trying to aim for the different colors and get more points made it an exciting way to stay entertained. Service was great and everyone was very nice and helpful. 

Food was good and a decent price. 

I loved that there was a mix of people from those who are very good and serious about the sport to those who are just spending an evening trying something new. 

I live in CA and I vote they bring one of these out here!!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience. My first time there and it was s much fun! I suck at golf but when you say hanging out with cool people and eating drinking away, that's always great! 

There are 4 levels to the place and we were on the 3rd level which was perfect. Great view! This was for a work event but still really fun. Definitely don't have to be a good golfer to go but just don't fall off the ledge. They have a net and someone said on YouTube there's a bunch of videos but you'd have to be be so drunk to be standing that close to edge and fall off that. 

Told my brother about it and this is what he wants to do for his bachelor trip now. Ohhh and also a pool on he side if you bring your bathing suits."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Arizona Finally we have a place to have fun and enjoy golfing I highly recommend visiting when get a chance it worth a try"}
{"text":"Fun thing to do outdoors with a group of friends, or even just to relax alone.  You need to sign up for a membership (Tip:  Healthcare workers can get a discount with registration).  After that you pay by the hour to use their clubs and unlimited balls.  They have waiters to bring beverages and food to your seating area as well.  Would def. return when I'm in the area.

Only downside:  it can get pretty pricey compared to typical driving ranges.  However, this place has more options and fun extras to do as well!"}
{"text":"First time at Top Golf. Won't be the last. We had a company function there and TG took care of everything. 

We rented a suite which included seven golf bays. We had drinks, then went to the bays to hit some golf balls and have a buffet. 

The buffet was a fairly deluxe salad, chicken skewers, salmon and roasted potatoes. The food was okay. I found the entrees the weaker portion and the salad/potatoes the better fare. 

The golf was fun. You get up to six people per bay, hitting 20 balls each. They have eleven targets and each ball has a microchip so it senses when and where you hit one of the targets. It then assigns points, if you want to keep score. 

I'll return with friends next time but without the food."}
{"text":"Super fun place for a bachelor party. Ok so, you book a cabana thing. $120 an hour and $330 minimum for drinks and food. They have left handed clubs too. 


The atmosphere is loud and fun. Super fun. Be sure to call ahead and book a lane because it'll get filled up fast on a Saturday!!! 

The food was ok. It's the actual golfing with friends that you'll love. It's like a driving range but you get points! Wave your club over the small hole and a golf ball will come out. 

Th downfall of this place is that the service is terrible. Takes way too long to order something. Like seriously 30 min wait. If the food and service was better, it'd get 5 stars. 

Anyway if you're an avid golfer you'll love this place. If you don't golf, you'll wanna come here anyway especially for a bachelor party or if you have a group of 6 or whatever. Super fun. You'll enjoy it for sure. Tacos were ok. Chips were delicious. Bucket of beer to add to the tacos. Yum. 

Honestly... food was whatever haha. It's the golfing experience and the fun you'll have with your friends that really makes this place a worthwhile experience."}
{"text":"Fun place. We went on a Wednesday.  I've never played golf before, however i quickly caught on. The service was prompt and the food was excellent. I just wish it was longer. Price is $25 before 6pm and $45 per hour after.  It did get pricey, we're competitive and had to play two games. We also ordered two appetizers, two flatbread pizzas and a steak quesadilla. A few beers and cocktails for four people. Our total was $250. Next time we will eat prior to playing so nothing interrupts our playing time."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had.  Forgotten orders, no check-ups, no attention. I know it was busy but just an overall lack of respect by the server.  Really tainted my first experience.  Just sucks."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out, dine, drink and smack a few balls. Fun location. I'll definitely bring friends and clients here"}
{"text":"This was my very first visit to Topgolf. Hopefully it's not like this in every Topgolf location. For now, this review is only for their restaurant on the main level. Service was extremely poor. Took about 15 mins to get somebody to clean our table. Then it took about an extra 15 mins to get our order. Then our drinks never came. Food arrives about 25 mins after we ordered and still no drinks yet. My wife had to personally get our drinks from the bar and bring them to our table! Just terrible service. Food was just okay. We ordered the following:
1. Pepperoni Flatbread - we requested the pepperoni to be placed on the side coz my daughter doesn't eat them, and when the server brought it to our table, he accidentally dropped all the pepperoni on the floor, stared at it and picked them up and never returned with a replacement pepperoni! Unbelievable! Taste was good.
2. The G.O.A.T. Which is a caramelized french toast, maple syrup, Cap'n Crunch breaded fried chicken, jalapeño gravy, over easy egg, green onion, chopped bacon, Cholula. - this was actually pretty good.
3. Veggie Burger - my wife did not like it. So don't order this when you are here.
They were a bit quicker when they want you to pay your check. Totally the opposite of when we were about to order. They were so hard to get their attention when you need them. It even seems like they were avoiding us. But when it comes to the check, we didn't even call them and they were there asking if we wanted the check.

Our current wait time for golf is 2.5 hours, so I don't know about the golf aspect of Topgolf yet. Hope it gets better than here."}
{"text":"We had to wait about 2-3 hours before they had a spot available for us, but it wasn't that far of a walk to MGM to play some slots in the meantime. I think they texted us when they were ready. We had a lot of fun! Most of our group had never hit anything with a golf club before, but they got the hang of it quickly. Fun daytime activity. Staff was super nice, and drinks were tasty."}
{"text":"This was our first experience at Topgolf and we LOVED it. It's so much fun and the staff are very helpful and nice. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Fun spot for entertainment with friends and God food selection.  Even if you don't golf this place has other options for you."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong: if you are 20 to 30 something years old, concerned with status and appearance, want to be a cool kid: all your friends are here. The bros and the babes abound.
Otherwise, you could have a good time here. $75 an hour in LV and golfing is reasonable. I was pissed that they advertise as part of MGM Casino, with a sign outside. Hell: there's an entrance at MGM. But that only gets you to the shuttle, which takes you offsite to TopGolf.
4 stories tall. Top is observation only. If you get behind one of the tee 3 stories up, that ball can move.
I'd have given them more stars if I hadn't valet parked at MGM and Uber'ed back."}
{"text":"The overall customer service was pretty good. The food here is AWESOME! I have had the nachos, quesadillas and the pizzas. The golf caddy drinks are okay, I would prefer them to be stronger. I just normally order a beer and keep it moving. Overall experience was good."}
{"text":"I have been a customer of All Sprinkler for a year and half. The service is extremely reliable. and professional  They are very easy to deal with. I highly recommend All sprinkler based on my experience as a customer."}
{"text":"Great place for beginners or experts. Cool place to hang out, play, and just enjoy time with friends. Food service though needs work. Very slow and the food isn't that good."}
{"text":"Top golf is always fun, good food, good drinks, and a fun atmosphere, at least at the Vegas location.  There is one in Tampa, will have to check out and compare."}
{"text":"We came to TopGolf for the Colors R&b event and we weren't sure what to except but we ended up having a great time. The atmosphere was great and even though it was freezing outside we were still pretty warm because there were plenty of the outdoor heaters. I ordered the burger and my sister ordered the shrimp and both were great. Our server was very nice and we had a nice night. I should have purchased a bay to golf though. Next time for sure."}
{"text":"I was super stinkin excited that the sleepy East Valley got this in their hood. This is more family-oriented and relaxing than the Scottsdale one. If you haven't picked up golf as your game, you seriously are missing out. You certainly still get your share of entertainment from people watching. Ladies, where else would you have an open access to men literally having their tush pivoted to you most of the time? 

The staff here is incredible. Our server was friendly and attentive despite having to cater to the needs of little ones and adults between two bays. Backup servers and bussers always made sure our table was clear and tidied up. Food is more your upscale bar gamut. The Bloody Mary is uhmazing! But if you are going to offer a bar of the condiments, make sure it is stocked. Running out of celery, bacon or olives for a Bloody Mary is total buzzkill. Was disappointed in the sangria as it tasted watered down. Love love love the wings, flatbreads and tacos. The highlight was the donut holes with the filling shots of raspberry, cream and chocolate. 

The setup is very similar to the Scottsdale location; though, most of the seating is high chairs rather than the abundant lounging loveseats. Our bay was on the second floor and perfectly situated in the middle, close to the bar and all the TV screens. No worries gentlemen, each bay is equipped with a flat screen any how. Parking is huge and found it relatively easy to grab a spot. However, this location definitely lacks in efficiency when you are getting your player's card and reserving a bay. Half my group went online but still stood in a long line, despite we hadn't hit their peak hours. So if you can grin and bear it, this is perfect outing spot for a Sunday Funday!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go with friends and family. I'm not really sure how the scoring works, still a good time all around. Great service, typical bar style food and drinks are reasonably priced just above PT Bar prices. Would recommend to anyone wanting to hang out with family and friends. Oh and they have pools too!!"}
{"text":"How can you not like Topgolf? Everything about this place is awesome. Drinks are great, food is good, service is always top notch and now what makes Topgolf even better is the ability to make reservations online to prevent waiting."}
{"text":"Game play is fun, but I'm not sure the level of service is worth the price.
I used to go there all the time in the first year or so it was opened, but since then their standards for the serving staff have seriously gone down hill.

I'm a pretty patient person when it comes to servers, but the last few times I've gone, I've had to track someone down to get service at our bay.

Let's just take last night for example:
My friends and I were for more than 15 minutes before someone finally came to the table to just say hello and take drink orders. Luckily, in that time we'd decided on food, otherwise who knows how long it would have been before we could have ordered.
We had eaten most of our food and had a refill of chips on the way (thanks to a food runner) before our server brought out my friend's drink.
She'd forgotten it was at the bar, and instead of having a new one made, she'd brought the drink to the table with almost all the ice melted. We had to track her down again so we could ask to get a new one made.
We saw food runners and bussers more than twice the number of times we saw our actual server the whole night and the place was not busy at all.

On top of the less than stellar service, the food is overpriced for what you get. While yes, some of it is excellent and the concepts are interesting, most is mediocre at best.

Recommendation:
If you do go there, choose earlier in the day when you'll spend less on game play. The savings at that time might at least be worth what you pay for overall experience."}
{"text":"Wow! What a blast! Great service, amazing good, and decently priced booze! So much fun for you and your friends. I can't wait for my family to visit so I can show them this gem! The manager, Cory tending to us was so accommodating and helpful! Thanks for such a great night guys. I highly recommend checking this place out, just get their early evening so you can avoid the wait!"}
{"text":"We were in Las Vegas for a trade event and decided to give Top Golf a try, as it looked like fun when we drove by. It was a BLAST! We went as a couple, but each bay (that you rent by the hour) holds up to 6 people, so you could do a family or friend group. We had a lot of fun with just the two of us sharing a bay, as we then could get a lot of golf in one right after the other. The night we were there, *TONY* (huge shout out) was our host, taking us to our bay, introducing us to the venue, explaining the equipment and the available \"games,\" showing us how to use the (very very easy) computer screen to keep score, etc. He did such a great job, even including some tips to level the playing field, since my husband is an expert golfer and I am barely a golfer at all. Needless to say, we had an incredible time (due in huge part to Tony's introduction and advice), and we will greatly look forward to returning when we come back to town. There was a huge private event there that night with hundreds of guests, which blocked 2 of the 4 floors from public play, but the only affect this had on our experience was a minor mix-up with a service-person not coming by to take our refresher-drink orders (which was no big deal, as the bar was literally steps from our bay) and check us out when we were done; not to worry, though, as Tony met us as we finished and took care of the oversight post haste. GO! You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Overall, I agree with my fellow Yelpers. I am a fan of TopGolf because who refuses entertainment and fun at the brainchild of a sports bar and 3-story driving range with a lounge? 

It can be a bit confusing when you first arrive. The parking has never been an issue for me though I've noticed some complaints. You do have to get a card for $5 but once you have that, you are golden, like lifetime membership status. You can upgrade for VIP service if you need that distinction. There is a second line to get your bay but it goes pretty fast. I will say my last experience there, the POS was down and we got overcharged for our bay and wasn't too happy with that oversight. The terminals are pretty easy to set up your games but if you need instruction, there's always a friendly group next to you such as mine or the staff.

Now, if you are a true golfer, yes your snobbery is duly noted that it is nothing like the real driving range. But come on? Not too many of those are open late night with a fantastic light show to feed your Masters' dream. If you get bored with the games, you can always strut down to the bar and check out the multiple TV screens and colorful patrons. Where else other than the WM Phoenix Open are you going to find women scantily clad when golf is involved?

Staff is spotty when it comes to bay service but overall attentive to your needs. Food is pretty good and the drinks are extensive enough for your various taste buds. Overall, it's fun for big group outings and company events. I prefer night time because you can catch the sunset and the balmy breeze almost makes you feel like you got transported outside the desert."}
{"text":"This place is always fun.  Can't come to the area without visiting.  Great service, food and fun."}
{"text":"Top golf is awesome!  How can you not love ripping some balls and getting the satisfaction of placing some nice shots without the frustration of trying to find the bad ones in the bushes!  The food here is really good also.  They make paying for time in the bay easy and hassle free.  We love coming here for family events because the atmosphere is great for conversation and we can get in some friendly competition.  Fun times!"}
{"text":"Topgolf is really fun! It's like Lucky Strike, but for golf! It's great with a group or for a first date! 
There is a full menu of food and drinks and great service. 
- It's crowded at night, but there was no wait when I went in the afternoon. You can also make reservations, but reservations require a minimum spend (it was $300 minimum for the bay when I called to check).
- It is a mostly outdoors venue, and has heat lamps and a/c at the individual bays (tables). 
- In order to play, you need a Topgolf membership - just $5 for lifetime membership! 
- there is also a bar with lots of TVs and cornhole downstairs!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite top golf in town. Wait, it is the only top golf in LV. Part of the chain, it is a golf party atmosphere where you rent bays for the hour and order food. Seating areas in bays are comfortable with heating lamps."}
{"text":"Been here 20+ times over the last 4 years and rarely is food or drink service prompt, to say the least.  With the amount of employees they have walking around you would think the opposite would be the case.  It's as simple as full hands in and full hands out.   More drinks served and less employees serving those drinks is 100% doable, and will also improve bottom line me thinks."}
{"text":"I suck at golf, but none of that matters when you have the classy ambience of this place and good company."}
{"text":"A Topgolf needs to open in LOS ANGELES, ASAP! Despite being rather expensive ($60 per hour for the 3rd & 4th floors- us being on the 3rd, otherwise we would have had to wait a good 30-45 minutes) Topgolf is INSANELY FUN!! I could spend oh, you know $500 there in a day EASY!"}
{"text":"I like next door to this place  and believe it or not this was my first time here. 
Since they are always packed I decided to make a reservation for my husband and I on a Sunday evening. For my surprise to get a reservation I had to pay I reservation fee. Which was fine by me but I thought it was weird.
We got there 5 minutes before our appointment and the lady said we would have to wait until they had a free land for us. ????? So what was the point of me paying for a reservation? Anyways, we went to the bar ordered some drinks and an appetizer that was really good. We had a type of spring roll filled with Mac and cheese and bacon that was really good! In general their menu is pretty decent and not expensive at all. I was expecting some exorbitant prices for the food but fortunately I was wrong. After 15 minutes I got a text on my phone saying our lane was ready. When we get there a member of their staff was waiting for us and explained how everything worked. I decided to order a hamburger and my husband a chicken sandwich. The food was good, even tho they messed up our sides we decided just go with it and did not asked to have it switched. 
The place is fun, it is an ambient for all ages and you don't need to be a golf pro to have fun! 
I will probably be back at some point. However, I was really expecting way more from this place."}
{"text":"We took a couple hours to hang out with friends and hit a few balls... along with a few drinks and lunch.  Great way to socialize and have some fun. Staff was very attentive and service was great.

Looking forward to a Top Golf in Omaha!!!"}
{"text":"Had family in town and we were looking for something to do. We decided to try this place out. We had golfers with various skill levels (including my 77 year old grandmother). We all had a great time. Grandma loved it. The staff was very friendly, the facility was clean and orderly. It cost $60 for an hour at the time slot that we went to but you can split it with up to 6 players, which made it very affordable. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was a lot of fun for 8 of us on a weekday night.  Wait time was about an hour so we had a few drinks at the bar along with a plate of nachos.  Drink selection was very good and food was tasty.  
The game was a mix between golf, darts and bowling.  Lots of fun even for my 4yr old!  We will be back."}
{"text":"We had a lot of fun here.  
But there were some hiccups.  You can only valet your car.  As we were walking thru the parking lot we saw a valet attendant running thru the lot pushing a car key to see which one beeps.  We thought nothing of it until we were leaving and the valet attendant asked us \"Which car is yours?\"  ummm, what!?!?  Then they asked us where are keys were, seriously?!!??  So 40 minutes later they found our car and they left the keys inside the car.  So obviously the valet system is crazy, they take cars, theres no records or policies in place on how they handle your car or keys.
Another hiccup.  When we checked in the counter person said it would be a 2 hour wait, we almost walked away, but with 8 of us we just figured we'd get some drinks and see how it goes.  10 minutes later they text us and say the booth is ready.  WTF?  We almost walked, and when we got upstairs there were plenty of booths open.  Why would they say 2 hours?  Do they want people to leave?
We had a great time golfing and the waitstaff was attentive.  The place is great for a group and kids."}
{"text":"Fun for the whole family, but pricey! $75 for 1.5 hours for a stall that takes up to 6 people. That's a steep price to pay to hit golf balls at a driving range. It's slow to get balls by waving your golf club over the ball dispenser.
The wait was 1.5 hours even though we got there at 10:30am (they open at 9am everyday.)
The nice thing is it was cool on the first level because of the water mists. Without those, we would not have been able to golf on a hot day like today when it was 101°."}
{"text":"I went to top golf with my brother and some friends, it was awesome. 
I look forward to going back out there.
The place was gorgeous and i had a great time."}
{"text":"Fun! Great driving range, good food, and great service. Good for kids and they have left handed clubs for the kids too."}
{"text":"What a fun place! We went here on a Fri night. A storm was blowing through the area so we were delayed with getting started golfing. Food was decent, drinks were a little watered down, but the game was a blast. The check in process was Slow... One of the bay computers went down during our session. We would return just maybe not on a Fri night."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? I would give this place negative stars if I could. I am a local, and currently there is no parking available at top golf. So you have to park a mile away at the MGM and pay $20 for freaking self parking to come play. We had a work retreat here and everybody was so mad it just killed it. I will never recommend this place for choosing to allow some event to completely take over their parking. What a joke"}
{"text":"The good: Very nice setup, amazing view, the chip ball technology, the game setup, TV's in each bay, music/lighting.

The OK:  Food was just OK, I can't help but relate it to being at the Brunswick Zone XL, it was good but not amazing.

The bad:  Price.  We were there for 2 hours with 3 people, we golfed and ate, it was $225.  I understand if we're on a nice N. Scottsdale course and we spend $100+ a pop for a round of golf and some drinks but to spend this much at a driving range just doesn't seem right.  I most closely relate this to high-class bowling and I can't see spending this much on a regular basis.

TIP:  Don't hit it too far, if you hit over the net they will know it was your ball that broke that car window.  This didn't happen to us but that is what they mentioned.  It seems impossible but a 250 yard high drive will do it."}
{"text":"Topgolf is fun for everyone. Went here for a bachelor party last weekend and several of the guys were not really golfers and this was an event they could still be involved in outside of actually hitting the links. Heading back next Thursday for a work offsite and super excited! Also, being right beside Talking Stick is always a plus."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful time with in-laws and kiddos at Top Golf.  Golfing was $40/hr and food was reasonably priced. Kids had sliders  and pizza .   It's a great way to socialize, play and eat!"}
{"text":"This place is fun for beginners or advanced golfers! They have many different games you can try out, you don't need to be a golfer to score some points!"}
{"text":"Corporate outing at Topgolf. We have a very large party several hundred. Service was very good and attentive staff was friendly and the game was fun. The technology is pretty cool with using the RFID tags to track the balls. Fun place to go practice some golf ball driving."}
{"text":"What a fun place, a driving Range with a full service restaurant/bar.  Kid friendly too.  We had a great time here with 3 couples and one toddler.  The food and drinks were good, and the music was fun."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and the whole idea but the service was so bad. We waited two hours which was understandable but then we're sat and we're not greeted for 30 minutes. Our waitress... Nicole C. Proceeded to greet all other tables around us. It appeared she only had three tables the entire night but checked on us maybe 3 times in three hours. She forgot to ring in our wings and took 20 to 30 to bring out more drinks. For a place that we have to pay 45 dollars an hour you would think the service would be at least okay. I want to come back but will probably eat and drink before hand next time. I even asked for a manager at one point and she really didn't care. Being a former server it was probably the worst service I've had."}
{"text":"Top golf is very fun, I've been twice now, and I imagine I'll go again. It's pretty pricey, but if you go with enough people it isn't too bad. However, I'm giving 4 stars because the first time I went everything was working fine, however the second time, the computer system was bugging out really bad and doing things like not scoring points, or changing the player that was selected to play."}
{"text":"Initial thoughts upon sitting down with a beer and hitting my first 15 shots: holy cow, I want to build one of these for myself! 

Getting to the nitty gritty of the review and thinking of the questions people would ask before visiting my review becomes a bit more specific. 

#1 * The wait staff was hired yesterday. Or at least that is the view I had when asking a few very simple questions about the system used here. They seemed to have zero training on the system used and how to operate simple functions. 

#2 * Our waitress was very eager to learn from us what we found out through trying it out. 

#3 * Computer systems down. There were more error screens than you could imagine here. One of the staff even said the app has never worked here. That's pathetic. Get someone on it. 

My review is sounding awfully negative (but it needed to be said, otherwise no one would know what can be improved upon), which doesn't at all reflect my experience here so the rest will be how much fun I had. 

* Our waitress Michelle was amazing. It looks like she only had two tables, so you can't beat a ratio of 1:9. She was constantly making sure we were happy with what was on our table. 

* The music varies a ton! A good thing! I enjoyed listening to the cult classics and party music. 

* OMG The food! The food was top quality. Worth twice what it costs. No joke. 



It is blatantly obvious I'm a bullet/list reviewer so here are my key points. 
*Technology- 6/10 train staff and hire an IT person. 
* Staff- 10/10 Some of the most friendly and eager staff I've seen around. Keep it up. 
* Food- 10/10 Id come here just to eat. Period. 
* Overall experience- 9/10 This place was a blast. I plan on visiting as often as I can when in the area. It is totally worth every penny."}
{"text":"Top golf itself is amazing so I feel bad for leaving a 1 star review but... Amoi my bay host hassled us the whole time about our free play and was extremely pushy. At some point I had enough and decided to leave her a small tip . She proceeded to look at our check receipt and gave me a dirty glare. Sorry but how can you possibly expect a good tip when you made our experience HORRIBLE . Next time I go I'll be sure to steer clear of her section."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, All the staff was nice and polite. The bay are kind of small, but it's more than enough room for a party of 6. Had a lot of and enjoyed myself will definitely return."}
{"text":"We came to Topgolf to celebrate our friends birthday. We payed for an hour and ended up staying a little longer to hang out and drink. Christina set us up and explained everything really well. Amy also gave us some of the best service we've ever had, and made sure we were having a great time. Definitely would not have had the amazing experience we had without those two! Next time we're in Vegas, we're 100% coming back to the range!"}
{"text":"Great golfing and atmosphere but terrible service.  Management here is embarrassing to say the least.  The employees are friendly but their upper management is extremely unprofessional and careless.  I have given this place multiple chances and have only been let down.  Even came here for a graduation party and was yet again disappointed.  

Horrible upper management needs to be weeded out."}
{"text":"Great experience at this location on 7/10. Had excellent service from Lucy B. and Sukeida J. They made it a 5-star review."}
{"text":"Went to Gilbert to visit family last weekend and me, not being a big Golf Fan had an AWESOME time here! Fun golfing, excellent customer service,  and great food!"}
{"text":"Top Golf Vegas has a fun atmosphere, awesome technology, and tasty food and drinks. Unfortunately, the good ends there. From the moment you walk in, you are scammed. 

Upon arrival, it was explained that there was a 7% service charge for our previously booked \"premium reservation\". This was not explained when the premium reservation was made; clever lil scam you got there! They made us sign that we understood that the 7% service charge was not a tip. TWICE. If it was that important, shouldn't it have been mentioned when we booked? I have a feeling this is a common practice. 

We ordered a ton of food and drinks to meet the bay minimum, but had to repeatedly ask for enough plates, water, napkins, silverware; we asked three different people before we finally got some plates and napkins for all the food we ordered. The bussers seemed to make a habit of \"clearing\" drinks that were half full... likely to ensure you are ordering another round. This happened to three people in our party and felt like another scam. 

Per the website, if you arrive at 4pm its a $60 charge for the bay. After 5pm, it is $75. Our reservation began at  4pm and lasted until 6pm but were were charged the higher $75 rate for BOTH hours we were there. Again, scam. 

Finally, and most scammy of all, our waitress came to us after we signed the bill and said \"oh, did the front desk not explain how the tips work here?\" They didn't, but I'm pretty sure we know how tips work. She went on for 5 minutes to explain that $50 of her tip goes to the other staff who serviced the bay (I use the term serviced loosely) and so essentially, our tip to her, specifically, was severly lacking. \"The front desk never explains it\" she bemoaned. We listened to her rant about a process that isn't our problem, but didn't end up changing the tip. We tipped on the food service portion of the bill only, NOT the golf charge (which is included in the final bill with the 7% service charge). 

The waitress was so annoyed we didn't revise the tip she neglected to return to our bay to give us a final reciept. Regardless of company policy, it is EXTREMELY inappropriate for anyone to confront or challenge a customer on the tip. Just incredible. 

While the golfing was fun, the feeling of being scammed by Top Golf was the opposite of fun. We certainly won't be back."}
{"text":"We came to visit a friend in Arizona and came here. One of the best and coolest experiences I've had. The way everything is ran and the technology is mind blowing. The food was good and the beer prices were cheap. Definitely would come back here and wish they had a location closer to home."}
{"text":"My wife has spoken very highly of the Top Golf Austin location, so we decided to check out the Vegas one while we were in town. Our group of four arrived around 10 PM on a Wednesday night. First and foremost, this place is EXPENSIVE. The weeknight base rate is $75/hr and that is before you're forced to pay $5 for a silly plastic card for each person that you want to add to the \"game\". 

We were placed in the 21+ area as the other areas had 45+ minute waits, even though we had no intention of ordering food or drinks. We immediately were hounded by a waitress looking to take a drink order and we were forced to show ID. If you're going to seat someone in the 21+ area, check ID at the desk beforehand. We stated we didn't want any food or drinks, however she returned every 5-10 minutes to try to get us to order drinks. I realize this person works for tips, but I just want to hit some golf balls and it's not my fault the people at the front desk placed us at this specific area. Go away. 

I came in under the impression that we would all be able to hit balls in our own bay individually, but I guess that isn't how that works here. While the group games could be fun, I ultimately just wanted to smack some balls, and I wasn't able to do that. The price you pay for what you get is not a good value unless you fill the bay with a party of six, and even then the hourly rate is still bad.

I may check out Top Golf in another city, but I definitely will not return to this one."}
{"text":"nice place to go eat and enjoy a great night, thank you to our server and the chefs great food."}
{"text":"As a Vegas local, I honestly have no desire to visit the Strip or anywhere in the area at all, however, I have been dying to check out Topgolf since the location first opened last spring! I've heard a lot of great things about this place and decided that it would be fun to take my cousins here while they were visiting from LA this past weekend.

We arrived at Topgolf late Saturday night and as we were walking toward the stairs to the entrance, the valet attendant quoted us with a wait time of about two hours, more or less. I was a little shocked, but it was a Saturday night and I should've known that was expected. We decided to go in anyway and put our names down on the list and wait for a bay to open. If you don't feel like waiting, I would definitely recommend that you plan ahead and call to make a reservation for your party!

As soon as we walked in, I was immediately impressed. The atmosphere is amazing! Bright and colorful lighting, the current EDM and pop hits playing in the background... Topgolf will definitely give you a little taste of the Vegas nightlife without having to go to a nightclub! While waiting for our text to let us know that our bay was ready, we lounged on the couches in front of the big screens, played Cornhole, and enjoyed a few drinks from one of the five bars. The drinks were decently priced compared to anything you'd order in a nightclub on the Strip, so I'm definitely not complaining.

Once we received our text, we were lead to our bay on the second floor by David. The bays are nice and cozy and are also climate controlled, so you can adjust it as needed. David explained how to use the screen and how there were different games to play. We opted for the basic high scoring game. He registered all of us in the system and we began to play right away! We definitely enjoyed ourselves while playing. Majority of the time, we were just laughing at each other and how terrible the next person's swing was. Nuyen was our server for the night and she took really good care of us. She was so patient with us when we were having technical difficulties with our screen and even comped us some time to make up for it! The customer service at Topgolf is definitely there.

Overall, I really enjoyed my first experience at Topgolf and I know my family did too. The prices are reasonable, the views from the bay are beautiful, and did I mention that they offer a discount for locals? Score! I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit!

Tip: To tourists, the advertisement may be a little misleading because there is a large sign outside of the MGM hotel saying that Topgolf is located at MGM, when it is actually located on a street parallel to the Strip."}
{"text":"Last night I was invited to join friends at Top Golf for a surprise birthday party. I had never been before and for the most part, wasn't disappointed. We were on the \"main\" floor and the view was gorgeous! The concept of a bar with golf and food is so unique. I loved the food btw! We got a mix of everything but the steak flat bread I had was perfect! 

The game itself was okay but I mainly liked the atmosphere. I'm not a big golf fan. I really dont know if I would return to play, but to join friends again, definitely. The only problem I had was that we felt very rushed. We were rushed to start the games. We were rushed to pay for the games right away. We were rushed out of the tables after closing out. I don't remember the manager's name, she was being polite, but every time I moved I felt she was right there ready to scurry us out. Our server was amazing though! She went by just \"Tay.\" Ive never had a server that I felt was like a part of the party. She was so easy going, which I enjoyed as well.

All in all I'd say you should experience Top Golf at least once, but it won't be my go to. I was told they have games for free there also, but didn't really look into it."}
{"text":"I'm the VP of People (HR) for a company here in Phoenix. We recently held a company event at TopGolf in Scottsdale, and it was AWESOME! Everybody had a fantastic time. The staff was just terrific. Our employees brought their families, and the kids had a ball. The TopGolf staff was excellent with the kids and took lots of time to help the newbie-golfers (kids and adults) learn and get comfortable. The private room was perfect and the food was great too. A+. 5-Stars. 100%. I highly recommend TopGolf, and I know we'll be back."}
{"text":"Just to be clear, this is a review of the administration at this place.  I'm sure the food, drinks, atmosphere, and golf are fantastic and fun.  Because of this, I figured that planning a small business meeting here would be a good idea.  However, I didn't know that dealing with TopGolf is filled with more red tape and needless rules than the IRS combined with the DMV.

I just spent 2 weeks trying to arrange a small meeting where I would give TopGolf over $700.  Below is what I wanted on Saturday, November 14th.  All hourly rates are on their website or were listed on the event planning PDFs they sent me. 

* Conference room from 9am to 3pm @ $40/hr ($240 total)
* Hitting Bay from 3pm to 5pm and 5pm to 8pm @ $35 and $45/hr, respectively ($205 total)
* Food/beverage minimum of $300 that could be applied both in the conference room and hitting bay (for some reason, a food/beverage minimum is required to get the conference room)

They turned my offer down and said they were already making too many concessions in their previous proposal.  Bummer.

Anyway, everybody I talked to was very friendly and eager to help in the typical corporate fashion.  You know....pretending to give a darn, but really just wanting to move on to a person/company with deeper pockets."}
{"text":"Good golf fun! The food was pretty good and the staff was friendly. We had a fun night here with friends."}
{"text":"What do you do with a dozen hockey players for an afternoon when you have a long time between games? Top Golf, of course! This Top Golf facility was Top Notch, and the staff was incredibly helpful and went above and beyond. Keke, was able to get all the boys situated and set up to play. Our server was DeShawn and he was absolutely wonderful. Handled all the multiple food and drink orders and was always ready to assist us with whatever we needed. This was a great experience and our players had a really good time, blowing off pre-game energy.  From the Piedmont Predators, thank you DeShawn and Top Golf Charlotte."}
{"text":"Thanks for introducing me to golf! I came here on a company trip team bonding night. Top Golf is located behind the MGM Grand and it is not miniature golf. It is a lounge with a bar and several lanes (like bowling) where you can hit the ball onto a legit golf course. I was surprised I could even hit the ball (only a couple of times) but they do have a computerized system where they keep track of your points based on how far you hit the ball. 

They have a pretty decent beer selection and they were accommodating with setting up a good buffet (Southern food!). It's very much a lounge - no dance floor or anything. It was mostly guys unless there were other group events like us where it was more co-ed. 

The scene was pretty casual - no need for preppy, golf attire. There were also people looking fancy who were ready to go to the club but plenty of others chilling in jeans. 

Fun event!"}
{"text":"I brought my family to experience top golf the first time. It turns out to be horrible. The screen at our bay crashed even before we played. It took them almost 30 minutes to fixed it. While doing so, we gave the bay host the idea of transferring us to another bay since we did not have that much time due to another appointment right after that. So she did move us to the bay next to it. It went super well in the beginning but then half way playing it, the computer  crashed again when the bar host swiped her card. We decided to call our bay host again to see if they can fix it knowing we only had 20 minutes left before we had to leave. Long story short, the IT guy came again and tried to fix it but it took them almost another 15 minutes while we were just waiting in the heat doing nothing. The manager then came saying that they can extend the time but we said no cause we had to go. So they decided to comp us for the game which is fine. But i wish that i can get some sort of a voucher for the next game so that my family and I can experience the whole game again without any technical difficulties. A side note, we ended up not even receiving our players card. I believe the host forgot about it or something."}
{"text":"Wow! Just Wow! What a brilliant venue.  Even if you are not here to hit a bucket of balls this place will entertain you.  We went on a night when they had live music on the mid level stage.  They had great sound system which was set the right level so you can still have a conversation and hear great music throughout the 4 levels of the venue.

Try a golf bag, which are their featured cocktails like margaritas and such.  A little pricy at $32 and $20 even with the plastic souvenir cup but the cabana drink was tasty. There are bars on every floor so you will not go thirsty. Both draft and bottle beer choices have several great craft beers to select from. Even some local Nevada brews and they prices are typical for the strip at $8-$10 each.

We snacked on the Forager Flatbread while we were there.  Very tasty with quality ingredients.  Food comes out of one central kitchen and can be served on all levels of the facility.   Besides apps, burgers, sandwiches and wings can be had but I think I might have to come back for the desserts.  The selection and execution of these items looked amazing.

The views of this place are absolutely breath taking.  To be in such a brilliant facility with views of the strip at night was just WOW!.... Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Definitely had a better experience today than I did on opening night. I suppose I showed up at just the right time because there was no wait. Checked in swiftly and with about a 5 or 10 minute wait was at a bay. Wait staff just needs to work out some kinks and familiarize themselves with the menu better. Also ensuring tables in the bays are properly equipped upon being seating with napkins/silverware (I had to ask for these items twice). Sadly there is still no assistance with parking which is a major ISSUE. It's two lanes in/out. To lessen the headache with parking, once I reached the front I just paid the $5 for valet. When people start parking on the side of the road it limits the lanes down to one, which makes it difficult for vehicles in both directions. For smaller groups (three in my party) I think an hour is plenty, larger groups defined would recommend 2 hours. Looking forward to returning and glad to see Topgolf here in the Queen City."}
{"text":"Its fun once you get to hit balls. 
It just takes hours to get a hitting bay and you can't call ahead to reserve.
Service is just plain bad. They forgot multiple items on our orders multiple times.
They told us it was an hour wait to hit balls. After the hour went by they told us it was another 50 minutes. 
Parking SUCKS!! Im ok with mandatory valet, but it takes 20+ minutes to get your car.
They'll start treating people better once its no longer new amd the crowds come down I hope."}
{"text":"Although it is a great concept. The customer service and prices at this place are horrible. The food is super over priced, which I wouldn't mind if it wasn't disgusting and was only made to serve two people. Also, they know how much they charge per hour, yet the bays only allow you to charge your card certain prices, which is of course over the amount they are charging per hour. Also if you try to add time, it just adds it to your card, not to your actual time. Of course no one tells you how to actually conduct this, so after racking up $150 on our cards we had to have a manager refund us. After an extra 30 minutes process we were able to be done. The lack of customer service really ruined our experience. We won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I love this place. Never heard of it before and we wanted to do something everyone could do and found this place. We had a group that aged between 25-70 and everyone enjoyed it. It's set up like a bowling alley and everyone has their own little area. While playing, you can order drinks and food from your area. It's outside but covered and in shade so not too hot. I may like it a little more because I beat all of the golfers but it's still perfect for all skill levels"}
{"text":"Pretty fun and cool place to be in Vegas with a great view of the linQ and the strip. About $90/$100 an hour for 6 players but really we had 10 people in our group. So we all got to rotate. We did level 3 and the highest was level 4. Of course dress casual to be comfortable. The place looks clean, new, and a had a club/lounge feel with their bars and entertainment service, it felt like Vegas! 

It was not in any hotel, just located off the strip. The closest hotel looks like MGM."}
{"text":"Jayy was our server Saturday, April 16th. Went there to celebrate my birthday with 11 friends and family. We enjoyed the atmosphere in the bar and his service. Jayy was very tentative, personal, and had great energy and so friendly."}
{"text":"We went there for a family outing and to have a celebration for my son.  We booked the venue  through Kali, she is great.  I had mentioned it to her that we have religious restrictions as far as food is concerned. Since our outing was booked as an event, we had our own ambassador and food buffet. The food was not prepared according to our restrictions and even though they fixed it, no one really touched the brisket and I paid a lot of money so that wasn't okay. They also need to provide booked events with more than one ambassador, since one person really can't handle a large group.  Overall wasn't bad but could have been better."}
{"text":"Just love this place. It is a top notch facility. It is a great place to go with family and friends. You don't have to be a golf pro to have fun here. I come here with my kids all the time and they have a blast as well. 

Also the food and drinks are great too. Lots of good deals depending on the day or time.   The staff is very helpful and extremely friendly. 

If you get a chance, sign up for one of their tournaments, they are a blast and a great deal. 

Sonif you are looking for something fun to do, as well as a place to get some good food and drinks, you should head over to Topgolf."}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale and I must say that this was the most fun that I had this weekend at top golf ,customer service was fabulous everybody so nice and friendly I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Wanted to check out Scottsdale's Top Golf and see how it compared to the ones back home in Illinois. We were very impressed with the technology and set up at this location. The only downfall was the pricing was more expensive than back home but the atmosphere and friendly staff made it worth while."}
{"text":"Fun times! I've been here in Scottsdale and Vegas before so knew what we were in for. There was virtually no wait when we arrived at 10pm on a Sat. It was straight in for the first level, about 20 mins for second level and they said over an hour for the top deck. We went for the lower level as my husband doesn't like the height of the next 2 decks. 

If you do get stuck waiting there's lots to do. Great food, drinks, other games like cornhole and tabletop shuffleboard which is surprisingly fun. It's pretty easy to kill an hour or so here. 

The golf is fun and it's good for anyone. Non golfers like it here too. I'm not sure any of us takes the point seriously other than who's winning and who's losing. That's just for bragging rights. 

The service at the bays is always good here and in Scottsdale. Your drink will never go dry and food comes quickly. The wings are great, nachos good and 7 layer dip is awesome. Ps wings are really messy to eat when you need to grab a golf club. Also I make good use of my hand sanitizer considering I'm touching the shared golf clubs and eating finger food. (Don't overthink that one!)

The view of the strip is really nice especially from the top deck. Sure it can be pricey here but so is everything in Vegas. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Our Top Golf experience started out as 1-star but quickly changed to 5-star thanks to Sarah at the front desk. 

We walked in as a group of 4 at 7:30 on a Wed night. We were immediately told there was a 2 hour wait due to many corporate and group bookings. The dudes in the blue shirts were nice enough but not what I'd call 'solutions oriented'. It was just a shrug and 'better luck next time'.  went to the front desk and asked if this was normal and what should we do to better prepare for next time. Sarah ca.me to the rescue, told me about the priority passes and we were in a bay within 20 minutes. Go Sarah!

The games are fun, the drinks cold and food tasty. Service was really good the whole time we were there. We didn't want to leave we had so much fun. We need a Top Golf in OC!"}
{"text":"Topgolf is a great place to spend some time playing gold with friends. It's fun for all age, young and old and can be fun for anything from a birthday party to a bachelor party. The food is good and the beer is great! 

It's a little pricy if you go by yourself or with a small group...but if you have a big group it's actually pretty cheap. 

I recommend bringing a golfing glove because the grips aren't the best and I ended up with a blister on my thumb from playing for an hour (I don't regret it, it was a blast)."}
{"text":"Came out for a friend's birthday defiantly a cool place to hangout, & have some drinks! The drive course is fun if your into it, or like myself to watch. Drinks are real good and the bartenders are nice however the server we got once we were assigned our lane was a little slow (think she was new). All in all it was fun!  PS they have a pool tables, corn hole, wii, among other games if golf isn't your thing."}
{"text":"I wasn't quite sure what to expect when my friends suggested we check out Top Golf.  We wanted to find a fun activity while beating the hot Arizona temps.  I'm usually shy away from golf-related activities because I'm too competitive to accept the fact that I'm not good at this sport.

We were on the first floor, which was perfect - we could easily see where our balls were falling.  I also liked that there was a computer at each station that projected images of exactly how far you hit.  There were people on both sides of us but I never felt like we were too crammed.  I was surprised to see the variety of clubs provided...not that I know the difference but I'm sure someone does and would appreciate having options. 

The entire place was very clean and orderly (even the bathroom).   The outdoor misters were perfect for beating the heat.  The waitresses were attentive.  We shared pizza and the mini waffles with chicken - both were tasty.  I wasn't expecting a lot since we weren't going there for the culinary experience.  I was pleasantly surprised.

If you're not into golfing, there were some indoor activities (pool, arcades games, etc.) to keep everyone busy.  I loved the memories made at Top Golf.  My friends and I shared so many laughs (mostly at my expense because I was so bad).  It's a fun activity that all ages will enjoy."}
{"text":"Had a group of about 23 of us for a work event and the staff here did not disappoint at all! The welcome desk for check in was well staffed and easy to find. They greeted us and guided us to the rest of the group and had us on our 3 bays within minutes. 

The information and instructions from the staff were clear and helpful. Then they immediately took our drink orders and basically made sure no one had an empty glass for the rest of the night! 

The food was extraordinary. We had a little buffet for our group and it included all types of meat, mac n cheese and salads! I can't say enough about the food, it's just so good!

The tvs are plentiful and the staff was very willing to put on any channel we requested, and we made a few of them! 

A special shoutout goes to Dana, our head server, she was a superstar and just 100% dialed into our group and was extremely friendly. Probably the most efficient server I've had in years anywhere. (That's saying a lot considering we're big foodies!)

I absolutely love this place and have been begging for HQ to come to SoCal! 

Go see this place next time you're in Vegas. It's a great break from the casinos, it's fun, amazing food and excellent service. Ask for Dana."}
{"text":"Fun experience if you enjoy golfing. Priced per bay... we came around noon, so for level 3 was $60/hr. Played for an hour and then extended extra hour because it was pretty fun. Drinks and snacks available for purchase at your bay, girls are nice and helpful. Clubs for male and female players. Deducted 1 star because since it was Only 98 degrees, they would not turn on the mister fans... had to be 100 degrees before they would turn them on... 98 is still hot you know? Inside bar is nice too.. didn't check out the pool on the floor, but heard no one else did either in that weather. Right behind MGM... good experience!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Top Golf and I honestly felt it was just ok. I took my party of seven there during our vacation in the Valley. The 3 kids really enjoyed it ... the four adults were less than overwhelmed. The food was so so and  we all thought the golf prices were a bit high. All in all, just a so so experience"}
{"text":"This place is super fun! My only hang up with this place is that playing is first come first serve. The wait can be really long. I'm not sure why they don't just take reservations especially on busy days."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Had Amber as my bartender and she couldn't of done a better job. Drinks were always full, we all ate lunch, and seemed to keep us laughing the whole time. $35 for an hr of golf and sweet membership program. I'm coming back with my staff!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was such a blast. We had to wait for about an hour but sat in the bar and chatted with Michelle and she was awesome. Friendly and attentive. Wish more managers were like her most of them are on a power trip. She made the experience wonderful and we will be back."}
{"text":"After experiencing Topgolf during their pre-opening media event with fellow Yelp Elite members, I knew I had to check it out again soon.  'Soon' ended up being opening night!  I gathered a few friends and we made our way to the newest and coolest spot to grace our city.

Not everything went as smooth this time around.  The check-in process was difficult.  Entering our info into the machines to get memberships and play wasn't working and a manager had to restart it.   We played for about an hour and a half.    The games were fun and I'd suggest playing top chip rules.   

We ordered favorite foods from the Yelp event.  The shrimp, the steak skewers, and chicken wings.   They forgot all the dipping sauces for the chicken which took 20 more min to arrive.   Otherwise delicious. 

When we finished, closing out our tab was sadly worse than starting the game.  The machine wouldn't end the game properly, our server was missing for help and eventually we found another manager.   We arrived at 630pm played 1 1/2 hour of golf, how did we leave after 9pm???  Lots of waiting.  Thankfully a manager comped our games and most of our food.    That is excellent service and that is how you retain customers.   Thank you Hollie. 

I'm all for giving this place the five stars it deserves and hopefully their staff and their machines in the bay improve as time goes on.  I definitely can't wait to host more friends and coworkers here in the future.

{"text":"My husband and I have been to Top Golf in Utah, Ca, Tucson & Scottsdale Az.  We recently moved near Gilbert Az and thought we would celebrate our daughters bday at the Gilbert location.  Every Top Golf we had been to before more than surpassed our expectations.  We reserved online and marked Birthday event.  The place was NOT busy.  They gave us a table bay and we asked if we could switch to a bay with a couch, there were two empty ones next to us.  The host went down to customer service and returned to tell us they were \"saving those for events\".  So, we took the table and chairs with 5 chairs for 6 adults! The bays with the couches did not get used and were still empty when we left 2.5 hrs later!  The service was horrible.  We had to go get our own napkins, the food was slow, they forgot our second order.  Our drinks were always empty.  Even though we live 2 miles from this location, next time we will drive to Scottsdale to take friends and family to Top Golf.  We spent over $400 last night and it was very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Came to Top Golf for my birthday last night w friends and had a blast! 

We did not have a reservation and was told the wait was 2 hrs. We decided to grab some drinks and apps. Moscow mules were tasty and tater tots were crispy:) We only waited an hour and got called to our bay. 

Our group had experienced golfers and first timers and everyone was able to have fun. Such a cool concept! 

It took 5 of us about 1.5 hrs to complete our game. 

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Underwhelmed. Not a place for people who are serious about golf. Good for novice \"golfers\" more interested in partying and drinking.  Brought my 6 year old for his first time to a driving range. It's going to be a shock when he goes to a \"real\" range for the first time."}
{"text":"4 stars for the novel Topgolf experience, 5 stars for the awesome service we received for a unique/slightly awkward situation!

If your only experience with golfing is mini-golf.....have no fear! I had NEVER so much as held a proper golf club before and I had an awesome time here acquiring a new skill (the fact that drinks are served here didn't hurt, either!)

I should say...you DO have to get over the inevitable crowd of wandering eyes from neighboring booths as you try to perfect your clearly-my-first-time-golfing swing. Once you get over the stage fright and you actually hit a couple balls, you realize why so many people enjoy golf :) 

My group of 5 were having a great time when one of the waitresses came to clear our table of drinks and spilled her entire tray onto the floor, getting shards of glass all over our sandals and flip flops. It was cleaned up very efficiently, but not before we realized my boyfriend had a small cut on his ankle from the glass. Not a huge deal, but it was definitely alarming to see blood, and we were running out of playing time!

Because of this debacle, we had to rush through the last few minutes of our time to complete our second game. Luckily, we were later approached by management; they offered to refund all of our payments made towards playing time and memberships, AND offered us a round of drinks at the bar on the house. 

5 thumbs up for going above and beyond to make sure customers are happy. I would definitely return to Topgolf, if I ever happen to be near one in the future!"}
{"text":"I like golf, I do... the concept is great here but it gets boring quick. For peak hours - expect to drop about $90/hour. They have good food on the menu. Their pretzel & cheese plate is delicious. So are their deviled eggs, Korean tacos, and flatbread. 

We were commenting on the lady who checked us in and how noticeably unfriendly she was. Like she was having a bad day or a breakup and didn't care to hide it. I don't know... you pat top dollar for top golf you probably would want too service and too attitude to go with top golf!"}
{"text":"Awesome layout with poolside accommodations while you wait for a lane and a cool concept. My group experienced some issues with the service; forgetting orders, overcrowded bars and too few bartenders. All-in-all, a fun experience but I'd avoid it on the weekends."}
{"text":"Always a good time at topgolf. The Las Vegas location is definitely their flagship location and over-the-top with swimming pools and huge projection TVs everywhere playing sports. Their food is delicious. Can't go wrong with anything you choose on the menu. Even if you don't love golfing you will have a good time here."}
{"text":"The golf portion of this place is fun and the only aspect that brings people back. 

The rest of your experience at Top Golf will have you looking for the exit and other options. 

Wait times are long, service is slow, customer service is entirely absent. 

Been here a few times and it's always the same. Last night we had a group of 8, ordering drinks/apps/desserts, all while in our 1st hour of play when all of a sudden our waitress (who wasn't even sure how to ring in my beer or if they even had it when I could see the tap handle from where we were) comes up and informs us that our time is up and we need to clear out or pay for another hour. At this point we still don't even have our nachos which we ordered at the start of the hour. We tell her we are still waiting on food and she says ok and goes to talk to who I assume is a floor manager of sorts. When she walks away we see that we still have more than 12 minutes left on our first hour. We decide not to do another hour (they were out of the dessert we wanted, the food was taking forever (on a cold Monday night in March) and the service was lacking to put it nicely) and the server and manager immediately start to try and clear our table. We tell them that we still don't have all our food, which we have already paid for at this point (and the bills were wrong, so wrong we didn't even say anything because it would have taken another 20 minutes for them to try and wrap their heads around that brain teaser) and they kind of leave us alone for a bit. This whole time is still within our hour of gameplay as the clock is still ticking down on the computer screen...

Our second choice of dessert finally comes out (s'mores cookies, basically some chips ahoy soft bake cookies sandwiching a marshmallow and drizzled with Hershey's chocolate sauce, not worth the money or the 30 minute wait time, not even sure how that's possible) and they immediately start to buss the table again. They make me and my girlfriend feel completely unwelcome as they whirl around us trying to clean up her beer which wasn't empty and the dessert plates on the table which we just received. 

Everyone in our group is in the service industry (cooks and servers) so we know the deal. The level of service and quality of most of the food at Topgolf is on par with fast food restaurants, which is kind of an insult to Chik-fil-a.

Go for the golf if you go at all."}
{"text":"I went to Top Golf for a concert event! I almost forgot it was a driving range!  It has a pool too. Just really visually stunning!  I didn't golf so I can't comment on that experience but I will say if your going in the evening take a nice size group because prices go up to $90/hr and that doesn't include food or drink. The parking lot is small so be prepared to hike from the MGM parking lot. Here's a tip they validate parking so don't forget to ask because they won't tell you. My friend paid and I didn't just because I asked. Also the drinks aren't strong so best value is the 30oz drinks with the free cup. Just because you will pay $10 for like an 8oz. Or just do shots. The food was decent but you're not there for the food so not a big deal. 

Overall nice venue and as long as your with the right group you will have a great night!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Topgolf in Vegas! It's a super easy process to get set up, the pricing is great, and the golf areas are really comfortable with couches and tvs set up. We golfed during the afternoon one weekend and got right in, no wait, for the second floor. The game system is easy, with several game style options, and it is actually really fun. 
The food and drinks were amazing too. If you're going just for that, it's worth it. I had a margarita, burger, and tots. All were great. My boyfriend had the wings and was pretty impressed as well, far better than hooters offers down the street. 


Ladies - if you're tall and new to golfing, consider the men's clubs. The staff kept trying to get me to use the female clubs, but at 5'10 I'm just too tall for them AND I have years of golf experience, the heavier weight of the men's club was better."}
{"text":"What a fun, but expensive way to spend an afternoon!  Our group of four reserved a bay for 3 hours and played multiple games as well as enjoyed some tasty food and drinks.  I had the Angry Orchard rose cider (yum) and we shared the grilled chicken sandwich with tots, the bao bun tacos with brisket and the pretzel bites with mustard and cheese.  Each bay is also outfitted with a TV, so you can watch whatever sports are on at that time - NBA playoffs for us!  We'll definitely be back for some more fun with friends!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing I've been there twice and each time I enjoyed myself as well as a service and I will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times and usually have a decent time. We had some drinks at the bar which was fine and bartender was really good. However when we finally got to our bay and ordered our food, they forgot part of our appetizer order and therefore an item came to us towards the end of our game. We constantly had to repeated requests for napkins but none of this was really a big deal. As we waited to check out, they charged us for a membership fee even though we already had memberships. This was resolved. But when one member of our party asked for a box to take home the item that came late, the red-shirted Kelly, cleared away the food without asking and was very rude to our party. No apology for the mistake. But only muttered that she would replace the order, however didn't even wait for our response. The two servers were nice and were more concerned about the mistake than she was. We were polite the entire time but Kelly was not."}
{"text":"Great service! Also, we walked right in and got a 
bay within minutes on a holiday. The drinks are good, but not strong at all. The staff is very friendly though.  Get there earlier to avoid a wait, this place fills up! Get the grilled wings!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time on a Friday night! It was so much fun! There's 3 floors to hit off- one is ground level. The first round gives you 20 balls to hit. After trying some different clubs and styles of swinging, you learn a decent way to hit. There's music playing in the background, food and drink service to your table, think of bowling alley style service. Best part is watch the people beat you to see how to hit better lol. It was $45 for an hour of golf, I think for anyone hitting, not per person, per party- but I didn't pay so not totally sure :)"}
{"text":"I had an awesome experience and I recommend everyone to try it, I brought my 7 year old and her 10 year old friend. They had a blast I was absolutely surprised, it's great for adult gatherings also. I always bring my family in and out of town. It's a sophisticated retreat from the busy Scottsdale scene. You feel like you are out on the town and doing something very different and trendy. I always like to do something classy and in the scene and this is the place to do it. Our server and instructor August, was awesome and I am going to special request he will be helping us on our next visit."}
{"text":"Though I love to play Topgolf I did not have a good experience at the Las Vegas location. They told us it would be a 45 min wait (even though while checking in there were TONS of open stalls) we ended up waiting close to 2 hours. While waiting we sat at a table to have some drinks and had to wait for about 20 before a server came by and that was only after we asked if they could have someone come and take our drink order. To apologize for making us wait so long they said they would comp our first hour of play but when the server gave us our check at the end it was for the full price.
It just sucked. The game is really fun to play but this location isn't being run well."}
{"text":"I had heard of this place and checked it out while at Spring Training.

We first went there on Sunday night around 7PM. The wait for a bay was 1:45. So we went to the casino next door. However we got to see what the place looked like and checked it out with the intention of coming back Monday morning, assuming it would be less crowded.

We were right. Place opened at 9AM, we got there at 10:30AM and walked right in.

The four of us played for an hour and ordered some chicken and biscuit sliders and orange juice from the server. We had a lot of fun taking swings with the clubs they provided. It was like going bowling.

Because we went before noon we got the cheapest rate and paid about $60 total for the hour we played including the breakfast food and drinks we ordered. Then we left and went to a 1:00 baseball game in Mesa. 

TopGolf was fun and I think we will be going back every time we are in Arizona for Spring Training. Good value!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place to go that's different from your typical hang out spots. I've never really been into golf, nor am I any good at it. However, Topgolf is not your typical golfing experience. This is a must try!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was not very clean. The menu had gum and used sugar packets stuck inside it. The bar area was busy and it showed.  That aside the golf is really fun. The food is decent."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I booked a cabana for only two hours and very quickly regretted it when I showed up. I didn't realize that when you bring a group of guys, whether they golf or not, they're going to try their damndest to golf. So we ended up utilizing the golf bay more than I thought. The girls spent the two hours in the pool, eating and drinking, but I definitely wanted to stay longer. The crowd was super chill, the food was good, and the service is amazing."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for my bachelor party earlier this month. Had a group of golfers excited to try out Top Golf!!!Truly disappointed. Tyler was able to make the reservation and we actually were upgraded because the size of our group. Started off ok with the alcohol coming out within about 15 minutes. The food took over an hour an a half!!!! Most of my party left to go elsewhere to eat. Some went back to the hotel to eat and others went to the bar to order.  We had about 15 minutes left on our reserved time and the food platters came out! Absolutely ridiculous. Waste of a night. I suggest spending your money elsewhere!!!!!!!! Didn't even get to enjoy the golf since we were all hungry. Server apologized and told us that for some reason the kitchen was slow. 45 minutes is slow. And hour and 45 minutes means our order was never placed or they ran out of food. Stay away from Top Golf Vegas."}
{"text":"What a fun time! Laid back date night. Lil competition. Made reservations online several days in advance. Food was only decent. Shrimp cocktail was on the Southwest side. Burger was good. Lettuce wraps spicy. Scott the server was awesome."}
{"text":"I went there on Saturday night to celebrate my brothers bachelor party. I showed up early so I could ask the manager if they could do something special (like a sign or a coupon for my brother). I was directed to where the two managers sat and both of them acted like I was annoying them to ask if they did anything special for events like that. I was told  bro we don't do anything like that and then the went back to what they were doing on the computer. I understand that they don't do anything but they really brushed me off. Then after they checked me in we were taken to a waiting area while a bay opened up. We ordered a pizza while we waited. The pizza came just as our bay opened up. Before we could start a new tab in our bay we were told we couldn't get started until we went back to pay for our pizza. I was happy to pay, but the clock was ticking on our 1 hour reservation on the bay and our waitress was not helpful. She was really put out that I explained that our clock was ticking and it would be easier for us if we could just pay all at once so we didn't have to waste our valuable time. Then a greeter came over of some sort to explain to us how to work the game and get everyone set up. He was nice and helpful but then at then end of his 1 minute speech he announced that he worked on tips and stood there awkwardly until we tipped him. I don't feel like you need to tip someone at top golf for taking 1 minute to show us how to work the computer and then be expected to tip the waitress as well. Overall it was just a poor experience and we were just a number. I have been to Top Golf in Gilbert Az and the experience was far superior. Las Vegas can do a lot better."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice, and both times I've gone, there has been this rude server who seemed very racist when it came time to  ordering food. 
When my brother and I ordered food, he kept on giving us dirty looks and answered us with sarcastic statements, such as \"I don't know, order it and find out\" and \"just order, I don't really care what you're doing\" (which made us uncomfortable). 

Overall, the food was pretty good, but the service was not so great; that server left us with a sour memory. If we do end up going again, I hope we get a different server."}
{"text":"I've been waiting 40 mins for my car from valet. I'm sorry Top Golf, but you ruin the entire experience because when people want to go home, they want to go home; Not wait 40 minutes for valet, especially when that's the only option for parking.

I can be ok with over paying for drinks and mediocre food, but waiting 40 minutes to get my car, no thank you."}
{"text":"Different experience for the driving range !   You got to try this if you are a golfer in vegas!!!!!"}
{"text":"Valet parking only! $5 membership fee for everyone who hasn't been there before. The staff checking us in and holding the doors open were all super nice! But our waitress was sassy and she said they needed to hold a card the whole time when we play when asked why she said \"because we just need to\" we were on the bottom floor and told it wasn't as fun as the floors above. Fun place to experience once, will not be returning."}
{"text":"One of a kind fun place! This is the place you can hang out with a friends and families. You can have fun experience even if you've never played golf before and  just cross it off the bucket list after while you staying in Vegas. Me and my running buddy stopped by while running in the morning 8am. Just wanted to check it out how it works. No customers yet at 8 am. We started to self tour whole facility, which I didn't mind at all. 
We asked few questions to staffs.. And we decided  to come back after breakfast. Yes! They changed by hour which is a different price depending on the time of the day and the day of the week. It was on Thursday morning, we tried to come back before noon, otherwise price will be different charge. We started at 10:30 and finished 12:30 for two hours. They told us at the end of game time they will charge 30 min. Over different charge rate... What ?! But we talked to manager (Kasandra) and she took care of the problems. Also, miscommunication between the staffs. 
We had a fun and enjoyed A covered golf range.
Tips: 
1. game has to be finished by their charge time frame. (Not by per golf bay, bit different than bowing)
2. They charge $5 for the life time membership fee ( no choice- mandatory)
3) shuttle bus available from MGM hotel
4) yes! There is free parking during week days. (Not weekend)
5) if you are serious golfer (like me and my buddy), bring your own club and forget about the score-it's not that accurate)
6) no putting practice area ( I wish they have one)
7) if you are left handed, let them know when you check-in.

At least and last .. Enjoy and have fun !!! You are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Yeah, I suck at this, but I had a pretty good time!

Me and three of my friends rolled up on a Friday night around 8PM and despite it being very crowded we were able to get a bay on the lower level without a wait. It's a very simple concept, imagine combining a driving range with skee-ball and you've pretty much got a grasp of TopGolf!

While I had some really long drives, I was not accurate enough to make that translate to BIG points on the board. A few of my friends were VERY successful at racking up smaller, yet more consistent points by going for the closer targets. I was the stubborn one and would drive the ball 200+ yards trying to get the big, white target in the back, and failing miserably. I think I see why the middle and upper level are the ones that have the wait list. For one, the balls are very low-flying. I'm assuming this is because of the microchips inside, the dynamics are a bit different from your typical driving range. The other reason is you can't really follow your ball traveling to the target from the lower level, it must be much easier from the upper levels.

With regard to the food, we only got fries and chips w/ salsa and guac, but I was really surprised with the quality of both. To be honest, I was expecting the food to be of 'bowling alley' caliber but the Guacamole was very fresh, seasoned well, and had a great texture. Whether it was homemade or not, it was good enough to get me to order two in the same night! Next time we'll dive into the menu a bit more.

I have to give props to the staff, our waitress Tima was very attentive and checked in on us very frequently, not a single cup went empty! Dan the manager introduced himself as soon as we got to our bay. As we were leaving they were dealing with a guy who wanted to smoke inside AND drink outside, neither of which are allowed by local or state laws... I'm sure they must deal with stuff like this a lot but they did well.

I think with a bit more practice I could go pro. Looking into getting a jersey and I'm currently accepting sponsorship deals. Please send inquiries to my Yelp inbox!"}
{"text":"We had party of 6 try to get into Top Golf Scottsdale the day after Christmas...wasn't happening...we then called Top Golf in Gilbert and they told us the wait was only about half hour and the guy on the phone told us how much better his Top Golf was compared to the Scottsdale one...we chose to drive the 40 minutes further away from our resort to check it out...we got there and there wasn't a single spot in the lot to park...we waited for a car to leave snd went inside...we get in and were told the wait would be about an hour in a half...that left a pretty bad taste in our mouth for The Gilbert Top Golf... We ended up going back tonight to Scottsdale...they never lied to us about wait times...and we pretty much got right in.  It was a fantastic experience. The server Lucky was very good, did a great job...the food was excellent, which i expected to be mediocre at a place like that.     Only issue was they messed up a grilled cheese sandwich, we sent it back, and they charged us for another??? I assumed that was an over-site, and some procedural error in getting new food out when an order is messed up...it was only $6.00 so not worth the hassle to go back.  All that said we had a great time, excellent and attentive service from the time we walked in the door to the time we left."}
{"text":"First time here with my kids on a Saturday afternoon, and we had a freeking blast!!!!!
This will take the place of our get out of the heat bowling Saturday. My 10 year old had the time of his life!  It's a bit pricey.....$35 an hour from Noon-5.......but it's priceless to see my kids have a blast with their dad doing something sporty and outside when its 105 degrees.
We didn't have much to eat, just some fries and I grabbed a Goose Island IPA.
The service and staff was a perfect 10! Everyone took the time to explain how the games work and everything else. I will 100% be back hopefully with some adults next time!!!!!"}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait! You will wait in line to get a membership card if you don't already have one. You will wait in line for a concierge to request a bay. You will wait for a bay. I went at 2pm on a Friday (not a holiday) and there was a 45 minute wait. Also, most of the couches are on the bottom floor so if you want to be off of the ground... Expect a high table/chair situation. The injectable doughnut holes with the cream are amazing. I loved the syringes they put the injectable stuff in."}
{"text":"Very cool concept, I will probably go again once they have a chance to work out the kinks.  I was there twice since it has opened and both times there were technical issues which in an environment where you pay by the hour is very frustrating.  The first time was 30 min to fix and they gave us an extra hour so it was all good.  The second time our server had disappeared for 45 min and we had to go find someone and then on top of the taking 45 for someone to come fix, it took 20 min to actually fix.  By the time it was fixed the whole group (2 lanes) were over the experience and we ended up just leaving. Very bad experience although they did refund the time credits after much teeth pulling.  I have not been back...

Here are some pointers as I have found them.  Get there early as its a cluster getting signed in then waiting for the \"good lanes\".  Max 3-4 players per lane even though they will tell you 6, you only get to hit a couple time per hour.  Everything is an add on, so just be ready, although food and drink prices are not over the top about what you expect going out in Scottsdale.  All and all the actual activity is fun and I would probably rate a 4 star without the service and tech issues I have experienced.  Like I said earlier the first time they stepped up and turned the experience around, the second time they failed in epic fashion."}
{"text":"We went around 3:00 pm, there was no wait at all. There was also no valet parking, we parked ourselves, not sure if it was because of the time. It is a cool place to hang out, a little bit hot, because the golfing is outside. The food was good, drinks and golf was fun. The only negative is when you close your check they add the golfing to your food bill so you are tipping  on the golfing also. The golfing was $90 for 2 hours and our food and drink was $100 so the bill was $190. I think you should only have to tip on the service. So they are getting $20 extra for doing nothing. Tipped $40, but I think it should have only been $20 tip."}
{"text":"Walked in on a busy Saturday- the place was packed. The angry little teen that had been sent to work at the door told us to \"go away\" because it was too crowded. Probably not the best way to attract customers. We could have waited in line (really wasn't that long) but I could see his face from the line and that just ruined the experience"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service!!! Excellent food! Top entertainment. I would visit every time I come to Vegas!! And the drinks were fantastic. Not watered down and taste fantastic!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service. We were lucky enough to be helped by Trisha, the Regional Manager. She was accommodating and we had a great time. My only suggestion for improvement would be the queue system as you have to wait in one line to get a card that you bring to the second line to put your name on the wait list. Not sure why the first line couldn't just also control the wait. All in all, a great time. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This was a fun experience that will need to be repeated.  The staff were all great and the food is was wonderful!  The golf was a ton of fun, and for the members of my group who don't golf - it was still fun for them too.  The pool areas and various bars were very nice too.  The later it got into the evening, the busier it got!  Not cheap, but worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Who knew places like this were even a popular thing to do on a Saturday, let along during the week. My brother brought us here and it was a blast. You pay by the hour and all it takes is a small membership fee. The food was good and for being a driving range/open air venue, they do a good job of keeping the Arizona heat off of you! Definitely want to go back and have some more fun."}
{"text":"It did take a few months after your grand opening to get you operation running smoothly. Top Golf is so much more than your chipped golf balls. Great night club, with multi-media entertainment. I was impressed with the VIP party I was invited to attend. 
I am a retired US Marine and every year we have a charity golf tournament at Bears Best in June. 144 golfers; many of them need more range time. I will contact your management to propose a \"quid-pro-qoe\" If Top Golf agrees to participate in our Marine Corps League golf tournament. I will become Top Golfs Military Ambassador.

{"text":"Top Golf is definitely a place you should check out.  It's fun to go with a group and compete  against your friends in a variety of games they offer.  They serve food and drinks that you can order and enjoy while waiting for your turn to tee off.  

The downside is there is usually a wait as it is a popular spot.  But you can go to the bar, play cornhole, or watch the sports on their jumbo screen.  

The pricing is decent if you have a larger group as they charge you per hour for the bay and allow up to six people in each bay.  The more people the cheaper but the less time you get so the more hours you may want to play.

Overall a fun place to go, give it a try and have fun!"}
{"text":"First time at Top Golf and I loved it. And especially the Vegas location- from what I gather this is like the Top Golf to top all Top Golfs (see what I did there?) But seriously - sports books and slots if you want to gamble. Live music almost every day. Massive tv screens. And three floors worth of golfing + drinking + eating goodness to enjoy. 

Expect a wait - we waited around an hour and a half. But you can put your name down and leave or just hang out and drink. So it's really not too bad. I'm not super into golf but the fact that the ball just spits right out makes it so easy to want to swing for an hour or so. After that it got a little boring. My fiance is a pretty intense golfer and could have probably paid to stay all day but around an hour was plenty of time. Plus it adds up. Price is something like a dollar a minute. But hey, money is better spent here than it is at the tables. They have a large food and drink menu and each bay has waiter service so you can continue to order while you play. Each bay also has a tv ! We didn't eat but the food around us looked dope. 

If you are into golf + sports betting this is basically one of the happiest places on earth for you. These are two of my fiance's favorite things and he was like a kid in a candy store. Make sure to stop on by if you are looking for something different to do while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for a buddies birthday. It was a good time. They have good beers and good food but it gets pricey pretty quick. Golf isn't to bad you can split the cost up between friends. You have to buy a membership card to start its $5 bucks I feel it's a little nickel dime of them to be honest."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Top Golf for our anniversary. Our service was top notch. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"GOLFERS BEWARE...

I should have know from my elite Yelp event here that there were issues however I was optimistic that since this place has been open for a few weeks some of those issues would have been resolved.   LMAO NOPE! 

First off we arrive and no valet parking onsite no parking onsite at all.  I do realize that miss USA needed a tent and that wasn't the issue.  The issue lies with having to take a shuttle wasting 20-30 minutes each way. It took the same amount of time for shuttle service than it did when driving from my house!  And yes it's a 106 out. No shuttle stop with a place to sit and the top golf employees didn't understand how the shuttle systems operates.  One guy told us it's an as needed or on demand shuttle so we would have to tell the valet guy.  So we went to the valet guy and he was told two shuttles running with additional stops.  

When we got there we did find our party by the pool.  Which I was told I need a wrist band not sure for what reason but I did know there are a ton on minimum charges for pool and golf depending on the floor and time of day but between three different employees and again ranges of different prices. My friend got the manager and it was somewhat resolved.  I get it it's Vegas that means charging for everything.  If you want to sit by the pool without a bay it's a charge or the bay is a charge then the food and beverage minimum by the pool or bay on the third and fourth floors with a two hour minimum charge for play time.  I get that part but why does no one know their prices!!!! I mean come on they work there.  What a joke. 

My biggest complaint is the lack of communication.  I'm talking communication between staff and their lack of knowledge.  Everyone told us a different story.  This is the same complaint I had during my elite Yelp event. The difference there was I overlooked it since it was free event."}
{"text":"The golf is obviously cool, but the secret is the Memphis burger. That burger is straight fire. Best burger I've had and I've had a lot. Holy LIT"}
{"text":"Really awesome place! I've been here a few times and got the bay I wanted right away. Reasonably priced, especially considering you bring a few buddies so you split the price. The nachos are out of this world. They have people always walking around so you can always get help. Good music and tv, it's just a great atmosphere. Nice to go relax for a couple hours"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved Topgolf. I am a huge fan of group activities and this was the perfect activity for a co-ed group of all different levels of golfing experience. At this location, you pay by the hour for each station which made it really affordable for our group of 8 to play for a couple hours. We also were able to order a few menu items which were great (brisket tacos, yum!) as well as cocktails / beer while we played. The servers and bartenders were all really friendly and helpful, we had a great time! 

I look forward to checking out Topgolf locations in other cities, I've heard they're all a bit different!"}
{"text":"It's a bar disguised as a driving range. You rent a bay for $90/hour (Friday/Saturday evening pricing) that gives you seating and a strip view. Food and drinks are expensive. $8 for a beer, $12 for the cheapest item on the menu.

If you come here for the golfing aspect, you will be disappointed. The scoring system makes no sense and isn't publicized anywhere, so you have no clue where to aim and what point values each shot will earn. The hostess attempts to explain the games but rushes through and there's no information on the graphics on how to play. 

As you're playing, you see where your balls are landing or what points you're getting because that TV is faced away from the golfer. If the entourage wants to follow along and tell you how you're doing, they have to read tiny font as that's how each score is shown. 

We had (3) golfers and could only get through 120 balls in an hour. Each round is 20 balls per golfer so there was a lot of wait time between turns."}
{"text":"A new way to enjoy drinking and games! They've taken the driving range to another level. It's like ordering bottle service and challenging your friends on the driving range. You play by points on where the ball lands in these lit up circles. You get this incredible view of Vegas and you get to golf it up. This place gets really popular at night. So be prepared to wait. The 3rd floor also has cabanas and a pool to swim. It still has some kinks to work out but it's still fun nonetheless. I would recommend this place for a fun drinking activity with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Topgolf?! It is pretty much a bowling alley in golf form. When they first opened, they had up to 3 hour wait times on the weekend evenings. I'm not sure if it has improved over time and with Topgolf Gilbert opening. However, coming in on weeknights are lovely! No wait! If your birthday falls on a Monday or Tuesday, don't hesitate to plan a little get together here with your clique. The price at night is reasonable -- $45/hour per bay for up to 6 people. I hear it is even cheaper during the day. The more the merrier and the more affordable it is per person. If you are hungry, I suggest the wings, you can't go wrong! The Asian zing sauce is tasty. I wish they had better options for dessert because that's my thing. The donut holes are pretty good. I heard they took out some desserts they used to serve that sounded better than what they currently have, whats up with that?! But back to what this place is really about -- golf. This is a driving range on steroids and it is so fun, even for the non-golfer, cant-hit-the-ball but who cares! It's all in good fun in the name of friendly competition. And the amazing attitude on the staff is infectious! I have only encountered super fun, energetic, attentive concierge and servers here. Thanks for the good times, Topgolf."}
{"text":"Liars. Unfortunately I got suckered into waiting 4 hours for a bay. I was told upon my arrival that it would be an hour to an hour and half wait. Checked in at an hour and a half, was told another hour or so. Checked in again, told 15-20 minutes. Finally four hours after getting there I decided to leave. How can anyone plan anything at this place with friends if they can't get even 50% accurate forecasts of actual start time. Something is seriously wrong with how they run this place. Felt lied to and though I'm local and represent hundreds of dollars in future business for them I'm not coming back after this experience."}
{"text":"Very expensive drinks and food. My margarita was $12 and it was not that great. Wait staff is good but my goodness they get upset when u have to split a bill. Perhaps if the prices were more reasonable the splitting of the check would not be necessary."}
{"text":"Fun fun fun!   What a great idea and fun place to have a party.  I will make this trip up from Columbia many more times!   Better than real golf.  Great music too."}
{"text":"Gosh this place is so cool!  My husband came here a few months ago on a trip with his friends and he wanted to bring me here.  We are in Vegas for NYE and he brought us for early lunch and an hour to hit golf balls. It was $45 for an hour to rent a bay to hit balls.  My boys really enjoyed themselves hitting balls on the second floor. This place is huge, there are a lot of different seating areas and games to play if you don't want to play golf.  They have a great food and drink menu. We ordered the breakfast sandwich from the early bird specials and a flatbread pizza.  To our surprise that was enough for 4 of us.  The food and service was great!  The staff here are really on it and very nice.  This place is family friendly so if you have little ones you can bring them along.  It's a little pricey but it was worth all the fun we had as a family.  It was an awesome experience for us!"}
{"text":"This was a fun and unique experience. You pay for the hour up to 6 people. This is kind of like bowling but with golf clubs.  The first 2 floors are cheaper per hour and cheaper golf clubs ( Top Golf brand) the top two floors are more expensive but with better clubs, I forgot which brand, but a name brand.They have 2 sets of clubs per bay ( one for men and one for women).  We had to wait about 45 min before we could play but we ordered some food ( which we were not impressed w/ the service), watched the game ( they have huge screens where you can sit watch TV & order a drink) and just hang out until they texted us to check in. 
Overall, our experience was good, fun and unique. I think that their customer service needs improvement."}
{"text":"This place is an experience, and there's a definite buzz there every time I've come.  When ever someone from out of town visits, I always make it a point to take them here to play some games, and have a brew or 2.  I'm also a fan of the food.  While it's not fine dining, it's actually really good for drinking beer, and their presentations are pretty on point.  The Mushi is a good one to try, and their flatbreads are pretty tasty as well.  They also make a great bloody mary.  For the true golfers out there, feel free to bring your clubs, but if your driving by and are thinking about needing to go home to grab them, forget it.  The clubs they have there are decent enough.  Besides, you're not really at Top Golf to golf, its really more of an experience where golf is just part of the equation."}
{"text":"This is a must-go if you're near a Tolpgolf. The place is incredible. Several stories, and huge. The one I went to also had a rooftop bar/dance floor which was extremely popular. Great place to hang out and hit some balls if you're looking for something different to do. The prices vary greatly between evening and daytime hours."}
{"text":"Finally tried Top Golf! A few friends and I went last night for some food and golf. It's a neat place and we had a blast!

Our server, Jesse, was great! He took good care of us!
The menu was big, but we settled on the feta/pecan/cranberry/spinach salad with chicken-yum! And Dh got the sunrise burger with bacon and fried egg on it- on a gluten free bun too!! bonus! Fries are too too ;).

Golfing was cool-were terrible but still enjoyed it. Clubs are provided, and the chips in the balls track where they go. Really enjoyed the lit targets as it got dark. Misters and fans kept us quite comfortable while we golfed. 

Can't wait to go back! A fun night with good friends and good food."}
{"text":"This was our first TopGolf experience and there were mostly positives to highlight in my review. Let's start with the good - 1) the music, atmosphere and open layout are inviting, 2) the staff is knowledgeable and polite, 3) their beverage and food menu is all-encompassing, and priced well. They heavily advertise the injectable donuts which looked appealing but we ordered the cast iron cookie skillet with fresh berries and a huge scoop of vanilla bean ice cream- consensus was \"AMAZING!\" 4) we ended up on Level 1 for golfing, they have 3 levels and several bays per party. They have golf clubs for women and men segmented by distance (yards). The TV screens show your points and distance, you wave your golf club for the ball to drop down to you when you are ready to hit. Very fun and convenient way to golf!  Now...for the not so great aspect - you cannot pay and reserve a bay in advance, we arrived at 4:49pm on a Saturday hoping to beat the crowd but were told it would be almost 2hrs before we could golf!!?! Whoa, well this sucks when you plan a double date night and have a babysitter waiting at home charging by the hour. Lol. The text-back waiting list is nice but maybe TopGolf operations and revenue should consider the ability to pay and reserve a bay by app/phone. This would also allow players to see when next available is so they can plan their night accordingly. Tourists have nothing but time to sit, socialize and drink during their wait time - but us locals need to maximize our time. Haha! Just a thought.  We all enjoyed ourselves overall but the wait time was a sticking point. We'd return but would understand time may be an issue."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to give this a try on our little getaway trip. She had been to one in Phoenix with a big group from work and raved about the fun here. We went on a Sunday morning and as soon as I walked in I knew I would love it too. This place is huge and modern, everything I would expect in Las Vegas. We were quickly checked in at the front counter and immediately given to a valet to show us around the facility and explain all the amenities to us before she showed us to our tee (area) As soon as we settled in to our own tee area we checked the ample menu and made some snack and drink orders before we tee'd up at the range. Each area had ample seating with a large coffee table, 2 full sets of golf clubs and 2 gas fired heaters. we were surrounded by t.v screens everywhere showing multiple NFL games including huge screens at the far end of the driving range. The range had a computer in which you input your player info and which kind of game you want to play and it automatically keeps score like in bowling. The food we had was actually pretty good, service was absolutely great and prices were not bad considering how much fun we had, but I can see this being a better time with a large group of friends. I just wish we had one in Los Angeles now, Aloha"}
{"text":"They didn't have a place to park. We were invited by the staff to park about a five minute walk (through a bad neighborhood) down the road. We did not go."}
{"text":"I love to golf and when it came to top golf it was a blast yeah it may be a two hour wait at times but it's definitely worth the wait you get to eat and hang out while waiting and after you can go to the lounge and relax and watch some tv definitely the best driving range around"}
{"text":"Always a fun place to go. Food's great and all of them plays are very helpful.

A really nice place to go for a date also."}
{"text":"Need a break from the casinos but don't want to venture too far from the strip?  Check out Topgolf behind the MGM.  Its three stories of golf range bays.  It's a win not just for golf enthusiasts but also for nerds who think their smart chip enabled golf balls are tech cool.  Waiting your turn? don't worry their giant screens will keep you in the loop on whatever game is on.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'll be generous and give them 3 stars for the potential this place has. If I was grading them on the experience we had on opening day, it would be one star.  First, the bay's on the bottom and main level are way too cramped.  They claim they will hold 6 people, we only had 4 and barely had room to move around the poorly designed furniture (why have metal arms on the end of the couches, no place to sit down and put on shoes).  

Second, the food we had was deplorable. The coffee tasted like dish water so we ordered a cappuccino but it had the same strange aftertaste (I'm not a coffee snob, I love McDonalds coffee). The Mexican rolls had a decent flavor but were too big and had too much rice around them so they were difficult to eat.  The chicken skewers had some kind of weird sauce that tasted funny instead of just being grilled.  At least the golfing experience was okay and the staff was friendly and very attentive.

Paying was painful, took 45 minutes to get our check and the only thing they comped were the coffees. I understand opening day issues (did NONE of these issues pop up during the soft opening, just wondering) but this is not the way to get locals back.  Unless I see a coupon on Groupon or some other discount, I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"YES! As good as it gets!  I mean, I don't even play golf and I had a blast.  It's just ridiculously fun.

Essentially it's a driving range, but it's that and so much more.  There are a couple bags of various clubs (5s to 9s, as I recall, no woods) to use.  There are RFID chips in the balls, so each player can track their shots.  There are a variety of targets, both close in and far away, to shoot for.  A computer keeps score.  When you hit a target a computer display shows where your ball ended up. 

I can barely hit a golf ball.  About half of my swings totally miss the ball.  But I was still able to hit the targets quite a few times.  I even got one right in the center of the blue target (175 yds) for 40 points.  

Neophytes need not worry, you really don't even have to know how to swing a club.  You'll figure it out.

Real golfers will dig Topgolf in a major way.  You can program the computer a dozen different ways to set up competitions between you and your friends.  

We rented a bungalow bay for my niece's birthday party.  She uses a wheelchair and access was easy through a side entrance, and an elevator was available to take us to the fourth floor.  The bay came with a server, who was outstanding.  

Food and drinks were brought out continuously.  And damn, that food was TASTY.  We had so many crazy things it was impossible to try them all.  Highlights were the shrimp (breaded and deep fried, sort of like orange chicken but shrimp), the sushi (surprisingly good sushi!), and the kabob/skewer thingees (chicken, pork and beef).  There was pulled pork and a lot of other stuff I didn't get around to.

Dang, almost forgot to mention the dessert!  They make a pudding cup that kicks ASS.  In fact, even if you don't want to golf, you should stop by and try this pudding if you are anywhere near the MGM.  Wow!  This isn't the pudding mix your mom used to make.  This is the real deal.  

If you are visiting Las Vegas and are looking for something different to do, I would highly recommend Topgolf.  Great party venue.  Great gift idea.

Mikey C says:  yay Topgolf!"}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of TopGolf locations, but this is by far the best. Mostly because of the backdrop. Shanking your 7 iron definitely doesn't suck nearly as bad when you've got the bright lights of Vegas to bring your spirits up before the next shot. Also, the service staff here was totally top notch, but that's to be expected in Vegas. 

If you've never done TopGolf before, beware that it's not really the best place to work out your swing at. It's more like the driving range version of Lucky Strike Bowling, so it's more made for group outings, birthdays, or in my case...a bachelor party. 

This is the perfect activity to pump up a Vegas weekend that isn't drinking yourself silly or losing your life at the tables."}
{"text":"From the minute I walked in the service and clarity of communication was awful. We were told to go downstairs to order drinks and food as the wait would be just under two hours.  We get to the lower level and no one to be found to place an order for food and drinks while 20-30 staff of top golf have walked right past our group. I finally asked someone where we should place our food and drink order and was told there is a private you shouldn't be down here after I was just told to go downstairs Then a waitress shows up and says for sure we can take your order we have two hours before the private party. Place our order then another person manager with attitude comes over and says we can't be down here. Ok grab us a table upstairs help the customer out and she says no you just need to go find a table on the main level or the terrace level 3. Nice!! Wow, get it straight folks, no problem with the private party but get your team on the same page and stop jerking the customer around."}
{"text":"For golf, an amazing place. This place is the flagship of the company and it shows. Everything was efficient and top of the line. 

My beautiful wife is a great golfer. I suck. But I love my wife and she loves golf, so......


We came for 30.minutes. My wife has been many times. This was my first. I was impressed with everything except the heat, but I realize this is part of the desert. 

We did not have food, but the offers seemed great. It was great and interesting even for me who was just watching. 

I will be going when I wife wants to go again when we are back in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Super fun, great date night or adults night out!  The food is great, we love the wings (literally some of the best we've had).  Only con is that it gets a bit pricey."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! Such a fun experience for any age or any time of day. The prices may seem high for the hourly rate, but it's split among all players in that cell (up to 6, I think). There are several games to choose from and I would recommend the TopGolf if it's your first time; think of it like bowling. The service is great and the food is even better! The do it yourself donut holes are a must try! If you do have people in your group who choose not to participate in the golfing there is so much more to do- Xbox Kinect, Giant Jenga, Bear Ball, foosball tables, pool tables, etc. The best part is they serve great beers to wash down the experience!"}
{"text":"I always have a great time when I'm here! Playing with friends is a blast, and the food is super good!! I go about once a week with a bunch of friends who also love this place!"}

{"text":"Un lugar muy gradable, cómodo y lindo. Buenos precios, bebidas y snacks y ademas ellos te prestan los palos para jugar."}
{"text":"Such an Awesome experience!! There's a lot to do here other then the driving range. They have pools to relax in, one with a swim up bar and one that's see through. They have corn hole and other games to play. There's a bar on every level, or you can find a seat and order food and drink as you play games. If you decide to hit some balls, you get a server that you can order food and drinks or even bottle service if you would like. The food and drinks were really good and the service was excellent! Shoutout to our bay server Shauna, who was awesome, she was on top of her game providing excellent customer service! Very friendly and helpful. With the amount of people coming and going in this place was really clean."}
{"text":"My husband noticed that from our recent visit we were overcharged. A simple fix, really, and he decided to call in. Apparently the manager he spoke to was incredibly rude and didn't believe we were overcharged. Maybe it wouldn't be an issue had we gotten a receipt... which we didn't get for the bar or bay. Not planning on returning if this is how it is going to be."}
{"text":"I love being a platinum member ! The service at the Scottsdale location is amazing tonight especially this girl named savvy helped me she wasn't even my host but she brought my balloons up when I moved floors and she even has hurt foot,... I was impressed she remembered and she also help me set up my Father's Day balloons and Anniversary. Hunter was very helpful as well just like Chris and jim... they treat you like family"}
{"text":"Good golf, food, and drinks. Went on a Monday night around 10:30pm and didn't have to wait in line at all. Also had their Mac N' Cheese Jalapeno Burger with Tater Tots which tasted great!"}
{"text":"Came to Phoenix to visit a buddy and we decided to visit top golf and give it a try since Yelp review said it was pretty good. I've always wanted to try a range like this and Top gold did not disappoint. I would say the only down side was the 2hr wait but it was a Saturday night on a holiday weekend. We went down the street to eat and as we pulled back in the parking lot I got the txt saying our bay was ready. As soon as we got to the concierge desk we got checked in and taken to the bay. They explained how everything worked and the waiter was there right away to get our order. We started off with just an hr of golf but added an extra 30 min since we where having such a good time. Next time I'm back in the area I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Don't waste you time and money.  Poor service and over priced.  What a disagreement.  It's really sad. Trust my post."}
{"text":"Good times, good food, and good service. Be sure to go at off-peak times so you're not dealing with long waiting lines."}
{"text":"Been here several times.   Very high touch and responsive staff.  Food is above expectations and service is always consistent.  Great management and access to golf instruction really helps novice attendees.  Overall great value and fun experience. Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"First time coming to Top Golf, and all I have to say is...WOW! I will most likely be making the 6 hour drive from San Diego to Gilbert, AZ just to play, drink and eat at this establishment. Lets just say this, I joined the golf team in high school for two weeks...and then quit. Why? Because I was terrible, and had to walk the course. Top Golf had me entertained for HOURS! It was an absolute blast, and so innovative. I suggest going at night in order to get the full experience with the light up holes/nets. Our waitress was on top of it, and always made sure my friends and I had a cold one in our hands."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Sometimes the ball sensors do not work and sometimes the balls bounce into another target by accident and get scored.  Not for serious golfers.  Food is decent.  Smallish pool.  Parking is right up against the hot Vegas sun.  No covered parking.  This place is a little more expensive than the other locations."}
{"text":"Took my wife and 2 of her girlfriends here last night and it was awesome!  I had been to the one in San Antonio 2 years ago and was extremely impressed. I was excited when they opened up this one and finally got around to going last night. 

My wife and 10 year old had come here with her girlfriend and her 10 year old last month and they had a great time! So now it was my turn... 

Really cool atmosphere here. The DJ was streaming some great 90's and early 2K hip hop. Drinks were great! Service was on point. Sorry to read about Michael E.'s experience and I feel that they did a lot to improve on that. Even though it was crowded, I observed that the wait staff covered 3 Bays each, it seemed. Each were posted up in the center of the 3 bays they were in charge of. Our guy, Adam F., was polite courteous and attentive. We never had to look for him or ask one of his colleagues if he can come by to fulfill a request we had. 

We came and were told of a 45 min wait @ around 9:30 PM. All good, we went towards the bar area to get some food and drinks then five mins. later we got the text saying a Bay opened up. Solid! 

The food is subpar- yes, but I can see them stepping it up more in the future. We played 3 games there and had a great time! It was pricy, yes - but it is Vegas and I think plan on expecting it. It was worth it for us. I and we, plan on coming back in the near future for sure!"}
{"text":"Be weary of the servers at Top Golf. Especially ones named Hannah M. She altered my receipt and gave herself a 110% tip. When my credit card company called to dispute the charge, the manager called me back the next day and tried to refund only the altered tip. I didn't even get an apology for the altered receipt, overcharging my card, or spending a Saturday on the phone trying to get the charges reversed. You suck top golf."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would! Me and my family went today as a Christmas present and the service was horrible! First, half my party was from out of town and they made everyone sign up for a membership card even though they don't live in the state and don't have a top golf by them and had to pay for the membership cards for them to only use once! We got food at the bar while waiting for a bay to open and the server waited around until 12 so we couldn't order brunch even though it was only 11:40  and brunch is over with at noon. They also don't have good sitting for older people my grandma had to fight the the bar stool because they were so high up and they have no tables to sit at to accommodate older people. We moved to our bay and no one told our server we moved so we waited almost 1  1/2 for food that wasn't even that good and our order wasn't even right and they had to remake it 3 times before getting a pizza with no cheese right due to a dairy allergy. Getting Togo boxes was a nightmare I ended up going to the kitchen door to ask for them from a kitchen member. Last but not least let's not forget it was so hot due to the heaters because they had them on way to high and the music speakers were way to loud I couldn't even talk without having to yell to my family. Overall one on the worst Christmas presents ever the staff is just so rude, snobby, and sassy from all employees including the manager!"}
{"text":"Not a place I would go for dinner, but they have food to eat if you work up an appetite golfing. Great place to practice your swings during the day, and at night it turns into a night life mini golf place with Cosmo lights on the course. They also have bags, jinga, and other great games to play. Their sangria is also amazing!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Top Golf. We got there at 9.30 and was told it would be a 4hr wait. We decided not to Golf but just experience the bar and food area. I must say the good was actually good but it's so busy and chaotic it took forever for our waitress to come. When she did check in with us, it was so infrequent. I would definitely comeback so I can experience everything."}
{"text":"Even if your a horrible golfer this place is super fun! They have a full bar, with some really good cocktails! If it's your first time they go through everything with you and hey make it super easy! I do however recommend if you have a large group to have several alleys or add more time. We had a group of 7 and played for 2 hours but I could have gone all night! It's super neat at night because it is all lit up too!"}
{"text":"We were so excited to check this place out, but left kinda disappointed in the whole experience. 

We tried to make reservations ahead of time, but could not get through to someone on the phone when we called. We arrived at 7ish and decided on a 3rd floor bay- $75 plus a ridiculous $5 membership fee per person. The price list when you arrived stated all the \"walk-in\" pricing. So, I informed the woman who was taking our reservation that we tried to call ahead, blah blah blah and I was frustrated that now we were stuck paying walk - in pricing. She explained that Top Golf does not accept reservations and the \"walk-in pricing\" is their only price. Then why not just call it the price....  But whatever, we decided to play and have some fun. My father-in-law was assured that all clubs, balls and gloves would be available to us in our bay, included in the fee. He was pleased because he did not have his gloves with him. 

After you make your reservation you wait for a host to take you to your bay. The place is beautiful, brand new and the bars on the 3rd floor were awesome. We got to the bay and the hostess proceeded to speak so fast that we had trouble figuring everything out. I was with my husband and in-laws, and the music was so loud that they could not hear her explanations. Getting set up on the computer system was another annoyance. Again, it was loud and we are all huddling around a small computer to give our personal information. Seemed very inefficient. 

Finally, we got set up on the computer and were ready to play. But no gloves - the host explained that gloves could be purchased at the store for $15 a pair. Wtf. We were told not even 10 minutes earlier that they were included..... 

Then, our server came to give us the whole menu schpiel and ask for a credit card to keep the tab open. We only played for a hr because of the expense and she must have come to our bay more than half a dozen times asking if we wanted food/drinks. Her interruptions took away from our hour of play and it began to get very annoying! There should be a call button for bar service. I don't need someone babysitting me.

$100 poorer and an hour later, we left. It was a fun experience once we figured out the games, but the service and the organization leaves a lot to be desired. In a place like Vegas where service is everything, this place is lacking."}
{"text":"I have been going to various topgolf locations since the early days in Dallas and have seen the company evolve and continuously improve. Generally, my experience at top golf has been nothing but great. 

Shuffling customers in and out of bays as efficiently as humanly possible is now topgolf's primary goal. 

In the first 3 minutes that we were at our bay, I had 3 different employees come up and try to get me to login and get the game clock running. Ok, so we get logged in and got the game clock running. We started hitting a few balls, then decided to order some food and drinks. I only put the bay at 30 minutes to start because we planned on taking a quick break to eat some food (maybe 15 minutes tops), but how top golf operates now, once you cross the 15 minutes left threshold, a waitress will come to you and tell you that you are about to run out of time and would you like to add more. I mentioned we were going to eat for a few minutes then kick the games back on. To my surprise, this was not allowed any more, and once the clock starts at your bay, it must stay running or you are a worthless customer and must be shuffled out for the next, even if you're buying buckets of beers and multiple entrees. Okay, so I got over it, we kept it running and the waitress gave us a complimentary 15 minutes (reason for 2 stars instead of 1). We proceeded to order beers and play games for the next hour and a half. Towards the end of our last game we ordered a final round of beers and minutes later crossed the 15 minute threshold and there you have it, a waitress pops up within seconds to see if you want to maintain your claim to the throne. I kindly said no, we will finish out our time and head out once we finish our drinks. You'd think after you just spend $175 on food, drinks, and games that they would allow you to finish your drink at the table. Nope, we were awkwardly kicked out of our bay as the employees brought over some new customers to get the clock rolling. 

From my perspective, I work in finance and completely understand where topgolf is coming from. If you are maximizing your bottom line at all costs, then top golf has found a way to do it. It's efficient and well operated. But at what cost? You may have just lost a customer for life because you value every second of the bay racking dollars instead of making sure the customer experience is top notch. My only complaint here is to find a balance with all of this. It just seems topgolf is losing sight of some important values it should maintain."}
{"text":"Most I've laughed in a long time!!!  Top Golf is tons of fun!  The food and customer service equally match the total experience!  This place is definitely a must visit!


HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"}
{"text":"Simply the most fun! Anyone can play great service and pub grub food hits the spot!
People of all ages and skill can play. Don't need your own clubs. I hate playing golf at a course takes up the entire day. This is fun!!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. This place sucks when trying to organize an event. A friend and I wanted to book this place for a bachelorette party. They are impossible to get ahold of on the phone, and you can't book any events more than a week in advance online. My friend drove an hour to go and speak to someone in person only to be told they couldn't help us. When we went online exactly a week before the event, they were completely booked. We called and were transferred to 5 people before telling us they really had nothing left. Wtf? How do you book up completely at 7 am online a week in advance. I will never give this place my business in the future. The customer service is nonexistent."}
{"text":"We waited 3 hours for a bay. I understand that it's busy on the weekends but that's insane. We also had to park a few blocks away. 

The facility and golf is nice but from an overall experience standpoint there's no way I am going back on a weekend night."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome!  Went here after our conference was done and we had an enjoyable evening unwinding and relaxing.  Course is smaller than the other TG we've been to (but we're told that's bc some other courses are converted ranges).

Doubt \"pros\" come to play here but everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.

Smoking is not allowed on any floor (different from the one we went to).  Elevators available.  Drivers not allowed.  Bathrooms were super clean.

Food was great.  Drinks were full!  Service was friendly from beginning to end."}
{"text":"Food, Friends and Fun!  Great place if you can get a reservation for your party. Hard to walk into.  

Scratch kitchen makes the food very enjoyable."}
{"text":"We went to top golf over the weekend and I was ever surprised enjoy. It's was bit pricey for 3 of the people never swung a club but we really enjoyed our time. The food was good and reasonable price. 6 pack for 19 bucks isn't horrible for beer."}
{"text":"Great place to go.  Problem is if you want answers to your questions you either have to get them from the website or physically go to the location.  Their automated system is mind numbing.  Expensive system but extremely frustrating for someone who wants to ask another human being a question rather than listen to robots that sound like all they drink is coffee and Red Bull."}
{"text":"We had a tough time when we first got there but the manager Sean made up for it. He bumped us up on the list as much as he could, and our server Tim was incredible. I had a wonderful birthday celebration!"}
{"text":"Top golf was fun. It's very pricey not sure that I love the set up but it was only my first time. The pool was my favorite part I was able to sit out and tan and enjoy the lovely weather and when I was done I hit some balls. It always take me awhile to warm up so the games they have set up were more difficult but it was fun.  But I'm gonna stick to my local driving range."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town and wanted to do something different. We don't have anything like this in Orange Count, CA so this was a fun date night for us. The prices were fair and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Highly recommend this to anyone, we can't wait to go back!!"}

{"text":"\"It's in the hole!\" Interestingly, no one in our group uttered these words during our visit to Top Golf in Scottsdale. Our office gathered at this Talking Stick destination for an early holiday celebration last week. Regardless of ability, this facility offers a unique take on the typical driving range.

I've played many traditional driving ranges. I've also visited multi-deck ranges. In spite of this, I'm not much of a golfer. It doesn't matter because what Top Golf offers, clearly appeals to everyone from the novice to much more avid golfers. Sure, you can step up and just crush the ball all day. Unlike more traditional driving ranges where distance is all that matters, this range offers a variety of targets and automated scoring. Points are scored when your ball lands in one of the oversized holes below. The closer to the flag, the more points you score. Low score is out the window. How wonderfully un-golf like!

Besides the beautiful setting and the amazing facility, the kitchen can produce some very tasty items. Our group played off of three tees and a nice assortment of snacks and desserts were provided nearby. The only flaw with our outing came at dusk as our time was winding down. Those of us still swinging and hacking away quickly realized how difficult it is to track a golf ball as the daylight fades.

Top Golf is a unique venue for group activities as well as individuals. I'm happy to have been introduced to this range, because after years of working on my short game at miniature golf courses, I feel compelled to bring my sons out here for an afternoon. Who knows, we may even see the Dalai Lama."}
{"text":"Normally, I am a huge fan of Topgolf. I'm an avid golfer and have been to multiple Topgolf locations throughout the country (Naperville IL, Woodale IL, Fort Worth TX). I've never had any issues with Topgolf and have even been someone to talk highly of Topgolf to friends and family however, the tables have turned. My family and I came to Topgolf Scottsdale today as a part of my sisters birthday. Having not been to Topgolf in the past few months I was looking forward to coming to Topgolf Scottsdale. Upon entering Topgolf Scottsdale with my personal golf bag and clubs in hand, all seemed to be the same as in the other Topgolf locations I had been to until I was greeted by a Topgolf employee. The employee made me aware that if I wanted to use my woods (driver, 3-wood, hybrids, etc.) I must only hit on the first floor as being on an upper floor would provide me the opportunity to hit a ball over the net. This did not make any sense as Topgolf provides those types of clubs on each floor to guests who choose not bring their own clubs (picture below). Additionally, this had never been an issue/policy at the Topgolf locations I had previously visited. Confused by this information  I decided to go along and accept being placed on the first floor. Little did I know this was not the last of the unique policies at Topgolf Scottsdale. The Topgolf employee then proceeded to inform me that I must check my personal bag in with the front desk at Topgolf and then they would transfer my clubs into one of their own Topgolf bags before I would then be allowed to bring my personal clubs to our reserved bay. Once again, I was met with disbelief as this had never been a policy at the Topgolf locations I had previously visited. The bays at Topgolf even have designated space for personal golf bags and clubs! (picture below). Furthermore, this policy does not make any sense as it is completely inefficient. Located in a major golf hub such as Scottsdale, Topgolf will face many customers with personal golf bags and clubs and it would not make sense for Topgolf to stop every customer with a personal golf bag upon entering there facility like they stopped me. It slows down the rate at which they can let customers in and out, and it even holds them liable for the customers personal golf bags once they have taken them into their possession. Frustrated with the whole situation, I decided to return to my car and put my clubs back before returning into Topgolf. I will say the employee I encountered may not have been the most knowledgeable of Topgolf policies, but nonetheless succeeded at ruining my time at Topgolf. Topgolf Scottsdale does have great views compared to their other locations around the country, and our waitress did an excellent job however, I do not plan to return to Topgolf Scottsdale any time soon."}
{"text":"My 100th review!!! 
My very first visit to top golf was on Tuesday, February 21, 2017. I brought my 16-year-old and 37-year-old with me on the night that I visited for the first time. 

The facility was extremely busy as there were a lot of private parties. I believe there was some sort of a convention going on during the same week. therefore, a lot of these companies invited their convention attending guests to enjoy themselves at top golf. Many of the bays were occupied. I thought that there were not enough staff on hand to accommodate such large groups. One thing that is nice is that there are other games that can be played during the time that you may spend waiting for your bay to become available. If you are lucky enough to be on the premises during open hours, you can go down to the first floor to have yourself fitted for clubs. That is kind of a fun area. You can learn a lot about yourself, the way you swing, and what would be best for you. 

The hourly rates in the evenings are pretty expensive if you ask me. It can cost the same amount to go and golf a full round, a full 18, during peak hours. During the day, the prices are not as bad. If by chance you happen to know a local, you should definitely bring them along with you as they may be able to get a discount for you.

From their pro shop, you can find all kinds of merchandise. You can find things as small as ball markers, to small towels Chapstick, charging banks for your phone, to things like pullover sweatshirts or hats. Under armor seems to be their #1 clothing brand. You'll find a number of UA apparel with the Top Golf logo on it. I think the one thing that I may go back for is a baseball cap. Disappointingly, it is not one that says top golf on it. I believe it is a Callaway hat. Still, I like the color and I think it will be great for spring time. with a new little one in our family, I am always looking for a cute little onesies or things like that to buy for the baby. I did find one, it was the cutest thing. I just don't know that I want to spend that much on something so small that they will grow out of so quickly. 

I understand that this business is new here in Las Vegas but I did feel that my expectations were not met. It was difficult for us to get a waitress. She was not able to replenish our drinks very quickly. I felt like she needed my assistance but didn't have any. I do not blame her at all. I just feel like maybe the facility was not expecting to be slammed with so many people so quickly and therefore they did not have enough staff on hand. Eventually, I am sure it is something that they will figure out. 

My 17-year-old and 37-year-old had a lot of fun. They played several games within the first hour. I thought about extending the time for another hour but decided that maybe they would go and play some of those other games that they have available. The other games that are available someone you're a bar area include shuffleboard and corn hole. 

Corn hole is something that we have at home. And so, it was the game of choice because of its familiarity. Unfortunately, there were several drunk folks playing corn hole next to us. Because of that, they were splashing drinks around. Things are getting wet with alcohol. And people were just being kind of clumsy & sloppy. Although I brought this to the attention of one of the workers at the facility, they were not really able to do much about the sloppy guess. They only ask that they try and put their drinks down on a table instead of holding it in their hands while playing different games. That worked for a little bit, but of course, being drunk and a lot more forgetful the drinks in hand while playing corn hole resumed. It became so bad that we discontinued our game and just left to play shuffle board. 

Shuffle board was also a bit of a challenge. The board conditions were not the best. The playing pieces were not real well taken care of. The sand that should've been on the board was everywhere. And of course, Some people had used the out of bounds areas from the shuffleboard table as a drink holder. And of course, alcohol was spilled and the sand ended up wet, sludge-like and was not something you could play on. Drunk folks tried to slide their drinks over the board from one end of the table to the other. Hmmm, not cool. 

As mentioned earlier, waiter or waitress service was very difficult to get, but when we did get service it was great. Not all the waiters or waitresses know too much about the menu or their offerings. The presentation of some of the desert is not the best, although they initially seem like a lot of fun. The problem that we had was with their donut holes. I guess we read it wrong. But when we received them, the donuts were ones that we had to inject with their own feelings, like Bavarian cream, chocolate, and raspberry. They were good and everything, but they were extremely messy, got everywhere. 

Fun & a bit expensive but great for first timers"}
{"text":"Always a great place for the fellas to get together for some competitive golf and all around good time.great atmosphere and the staff is remarkable.food selections are really great. Well worth the money."}
{"text":"Came here last night for the first time and had a great experience at TopGolf. From the second you walk in the door the staff was really friendly, courteous, and knowledgeable in helping you figure out how to get situated.

The facilities are incredible, and the bar on the main level is large which makes for a nice sports bar environment. They've also got billiards tables, Xbox Kinect, and Fooseball to make sure that even the kids are entertained when not hitting golf balls.

Having three floors of hitting bays is awesome, and I definitely recommend getting on the top floor. Being able to look out over the field and seeing the targets is really cool. This is definitely no \"driving range\", people that would consider themselves moderate to very good golfers should not need anything close to a driver when hitting balls here (okay, maybe the ladies but definitely not the guys). The experience is more about target shooting and racking up points in their pre-programmed games, not hacking balls as far as you possibly can.

I'll for sure be back at TopGolf, the entertainment value is high for everyone even if you're not into playing the links or taking swings at a regular range."}
{"text":"Have you ever been to a bowling alley, but wondered if it could be golf-focused?
That is top golf in a nutshell. It isn't cheap, about 35 bucks per hour but it's nice to practice and you can go with nothing and the wrong clothes  and zero experience and still have fun.

I went with my dad, an accomplished golfer and he loved it. You can aim for a target that your skill level can hit and earning points for your shots is cool. The view of the mountains is pretty spectacular too. 

It's also great for kids, there's a game room on the lower level for them and a bar mid-level for the adults. Drinks and food are hella pricey. That's snottsdale for you though.

You can bring your own clubs but they have ones there that are decent too."}
{"text":"Lots of fun! Friendly staff with great customer service skills..went on a Wednesday morning and the price was $25 and hour. Defiantly would not pay more than that. But at that price it's fair.  Call ahead to check pricing. At times it can be $45 an hour. Defiantly would not be a fair price at that. But I can handle $25 :)"}
{"text":"Rip off! Over charge for everything. Have to pay to make reservations. Have to pay for \"membership\". Have to pay for your name to appear on scoreboard. Will NEVER EVER go back. This place doesn't deserve a star at all."}
{"text":"We had a lot of fun golfing here. We came at 10am on a Wednesday and it was pretty busy, so I imagine it gets pretty nuts during nights and weekends. We wound up playing for an hour and a half total and just ordering some soft drinks, so I can't really comment on the food. 

Our server was really nice and helpful, as were all the other staff we interacted with. I'd definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing place, love it. Highly recommended. 
We were able to practice golf, enjoy drinks, food and stayed away from the eat. I wish I had a place like this close to my house. Best best best place in vegas to have fun with friends."}
{"text":"It's not golf, but a great way to hang with the homies and get some frustration out. 

I love everything about Top Golf but the price. It can get pretty spendy here, so make sure to go during happy hour times and take advantage of those local discounts. Top Golf is like a mix of a driving range and amusement park; filled with bright colors, loud music, and drinks; so many drinks. The pricing here varies depending on what level you're playing on, with the fourth level being the most expensive. They've just started offering an hour of golf for $24 for locals only, get on it! 

I came with a buddy of mine, we played for an hour which cost sixty-dollars, but that covers up to six people, so the more bodies you bring, the cheaper it is. We were on the third level, and the view was awesome, a great look at the Strip and all four of the bajillion-inch TVs at the end of the fairway.  Even if you've never hit a golf ball, you'll still have a blast here.

Beyond golf, there's a pool area, an adult game spot with corn hole and two indoors bars if you just want to be near the action. Would I come here once a month, probably not, but when I have friends in town, this is a great alternative to the Strip or just eating your way through the valley."}
{"text":"Our bay was very glitchy and despite a neat atmosphere, good food/drinks, and friendly staff, it was not a good first experience at TopGolf. The system randomly froze and reset mid-play during our very first game, losing all stats/scores. Then the ball dispenser repeatedly quit working and required 7-8 resets by the wait staff and finally a long visit by maintenance with no resolution after. All in all, we lost at least an hour of gameplay. We were offered extended playtime but had dinner reservations to make. We were never offered a bay transfer. Overall, TopGolf was fun when things ran smoothly but that was rarely the case."}
{"text":"Ok so here's a few quick things about me:
-I am super competitive
-I love food
-I love booze
-I am AWFUL at golf, but I have the heart of a champion

So Topgolf incorporates all of those things which makes me LOVE it. The food isn't just bar food, but they have unique bites such as a donut holes that you can stuff with gooey chocolate, or charcuterie board that's a giant pretzel stuffed with all the meats and cheeses. I'm a BIG fan of the backyard baked wings,the burgers, and their new spring meatballs. 

Anyone can play topgolf. You do not have to be good. You just have to try to get it into their targets. We've gone with some amazing golfers, but they cannot hit a target for the life of them. The driving range is heated, so when we went for New Year's Eve it still had the heat blowing to keep us warm. As someone who is always cold, I love that feature.

The only call out I would suggest is helping some of the wait staff. My husband and I are in a couples league at TG and we come every Monday. We grab our dinner while we're playing. Out of the six weeks we have went, two times my drink was wrong, three times my food was brought cold, and the majority of the 6 times in all the staff were MIA or bored out of their minds leaning on the wall. 

Don't get me wrong, that's not going to harsh my competitive vibe. But it will def harsh me ordering more cocktails and/or enjoying the delicious snacks...which can be good or bad for me (depending on the Monday).

Pro Tip-Try to get the second or third floor bays"}
{"text":"Been here twice to golf now and there has been a problems each time.  Really took the fun out of it.   Will not return.  Very disappointed!   Shouldn't be so difficult to have fun."}
{"text":"I've visited here twice now, first time on Memorial Weekend and second time last week for a friend's birthday :) This place definitely gives people in Vegas something different to do besides gaming, drinking and clubbing and everyone can enjoy their time here from people that have never golfed in their life to avid golfers. Even people that don't want to golf can enjoy their time here with bars on each of the 4 levels and tvs everywhere including the massive tvs at the end of the range. The first floor is more for the avid golfer with a full-service Callaway Golf fitting center (only 20 in the country). The second and third floors are a bit louder and the third floor even has a pool bar. For the fourth floor, that's mainly reserved for vips like high-rollers and celebrities. They are also kid friendly on certain floors. 

As for pricing, they start at $30 per hour allowing up to six people per bay! There is no charge per person which is awesome so if you only play for an hour with six people, that's only $5 per person! Each bay also has it's own server so you don't have to keep going back to the bar for anything. They have a full range of food including items like Crispy Rock Shrimp, Wings, Yellowtail Sashimi, Burgers, Flatbreads, and even injectable Donut Holes! As for drinks, they have full bars as well as beers, wines, sangria, specialty cocktails and bottle service. 

I would recommend this place to anyone that hasn't gone and don't forget if you're a local, they offer 15% off! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A great concept. Golf thats not intimidating-- why didn't o think of This! Golf is fun, food is good, And the atmosphere is right. I especially like that they have plenty of cooling for this hot summer days."}
{"text":"Bought a gift card here for my husbands birthday and were so excited to go here on a date night on a Saturday night. We show up and there is literally no parking, we had to park on the street and walk up the hill to get there. My husband brought his own clubs, 2 irons and a driver to use. As we walk up, a rude employee stops to tell us that we cannot use any drivers tonight because \"to many cars were getting hit in the casino parking lot\". Then she proceeded to tell is we will have to walk back to our car to drop off the driver my husband had, apparently
Not trusting him to have it in his possession. On top of that we would have to wait an hour! Sorry. We're not okay with spending $45.00 for poor service, long wait and going to a range to hit irons. It's called a DRIVING range for a reason. So disappointing and now I'm stuck with a gift card were not even looking forward to using."}
{"text":"Great time today with the Family! Thanks to Taylor for being an awesome host.  She's a great representative for your organization.  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I visited this Top Golf location a couple of days ago with my mom and friend. My mom and I have been to the Chandler location and assumed this one would be the same. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed. We ordered the nachos which looked like they had been thrown together and sat under the heat lamp for too long. Our flatbread was nothing to write home about. The pork sliders were great and the pretzel bites were average. The margaritas we ordered were extremely weak and not worth the money. 

Zachary guided us to our bay and gave us directions. He actually made a sarcastic remark that wasn't appreciated. 

We each had 2-3 balls that didn't register a score despite being hit somewhere into the targets. We had a few balls bounce out, but at least 9 that didn't and the score didn't get counted. For those of us who are horrible at golf, every point counts. We mentioned this to our server who explained it away as the sensor on some of the balls not working. It was disappointing to pay $35/hr for balls that didn't work correctly. 

We don't live in the area, but if we did we would not return to this location and instead would go to the Chandler Top Golf."}
{"text":"They have this down to a science. Our flight was delayed so we spontaneously decided to go kill time and it was two hours very well spent. I had the wok roasted edamame and the short rib tacos and both were incredible. My friends got flatbreads and one got a salad and we all enjoyed our food very much. The sever was quick and friendly and the overall cost was really reasonable."}

{"text":"Worst experience ever!  I wish they had negative stars.  I came on a Friday afternoon.  We needed to reprint our cards because we had lost them, no problem..  In order to put our name in for a reservation we had to have the cards.  So we waited in the \"express\" reprint line for 30 minutes only to have a group of 15 guys be brought in front of us to have their cards reprinted.   There were only 2 of us and we had been waiting for 30 minutes already!  The group claimed they knew \"chris\" whoever the heck Chris is should figure out a better way to manage this place.  We stood and waited another 30 before leaving because we were so frustrated. 

The place is so unorganized and dysfunctional I couldn't believe people could tolerate being there.   The lobby was a madhouse and the kids running the place had no idea what was going on.

I've been to topgolf before and thought it was fun, but I will never ever go back to this cage full of monkeys.  Get your sh*t together."}
{"text":"Disclosure that we did not play golf because the wait was too long and the price was a lot higher than expected. Since it was only the two of us it would have come out to about $80 per person for 2 hours. You really need 4 people to make it affordable. We did however play shuffleboard and listen to live music but nobody came to take our order for alcohol or food and we left. Please note this is quite a walk from MGM so check your map and be prepared"}
{"text":"What a place, not really golf, but fun golf related activities. The place is packed, must be a  hundred employees, a long line waiting to get in, people having loads of fun. A really, totally crazy idea for a place, but it works (not sure how long it will do so) and everyone seems to love it. You do not have to be a golfer or know anything about the game to have fun, all ages welcome. Also a good place just to watch people being themselves."}

The icing on the cake was when we left college students were coming in by the busloads for a Halloween party I would say top golf is doing pretty well and we sure had a good time!"}
{"text":"First time at the Charlotte location but I've frequent the one in Atlanta. I attempted night time upon several occasions and was stopped quickly by the two hour waiting time. So I vouched to go on my Monday off and I arrived around 4. The price was $35 per hour between the hours 12-5pm which was cheaper than the typical $45. I had a HARD NIGHT before (too many Makers and ginger) so I go a sparkling water which was pretty tasty. Also if you can always request the 3rd floor which overlooks all the targets. Also my golf club of choice was \"The Wood\". Stayed for an hour and a half and really enjoyed myself. Happy Swinging"}

Food was delicious -- ordered a burger with tots, which I would totally get again. Games were fun, but can take awhile to get through with 5 people in an hour, especially with ordering food etc. We played for about 1.5 hours -- and by that time our arms were pretty much dead.

To start off, they were absolutely rude and did not want to accommodate us since they didn't want to take our reservation yesterday. Told to go back the front desk.

{"text":"First time at this venue. Parking was impossible on a Wednesday late afternoon, valet closed, I was told to park at the adjacent MGM public parking which I did and walked towards topgolf building.
It felt like I walked 1/4 mile. Not happy about the parking!!!! 

I'm still giving this place a 5 star for total well thought out entertainment, the open booths they call golf bay is where you rent the space hourly and prices varies depending at the time of check in. The golf bay feels like you're in your backyard swinging your clubs in an open space and lounging  around on a modern L shape couch and a big coffee  table enough for everyone to sit around and have drinks and appetizers. You don't have to be a golfer to enjoy this type of entertainment. 

A set of golf clubs is provided in your bay. Since I'm a lefty, they  provided the club set right away. This is a driving range taken to the next level of pure fun! Just like bowling, it has golf monitors that keeps track of your range and distance. You see colored distance targets, Huge tv screens across the field, color lighted posts around the driving range, I'm sitting here in an open space  a/c blowing cool air overhead just made me forget the summer heat in Vegas. It was comfortable. 
There's four levels of pure fun and entertainment, it has a pool and bar for private parties and the rest is for you to come out and discover this amazing place! 

The staff are always around to assist if you need something.
The appetizers we had tonight was a couple of flat bread pizza (looks homemade and tasted fresh), delicious chicken burrito cut up in 2\" slices. Food was plated neatly, and surprisingly the food here is delicious. We had seconds of the same thing. 
OVERALL:  great food,  pure entertainment and fun concept, pricey ( be prepared to spend big bucks) gets crowded, beautiful outdoor lighting at night,   
parking needs to improve ASAP!!! Use Uber or Lyft!!! I'm definitely a big fan of this place! Yes, one of my go to places for entertainment."}

{"text":"Top Golf is an experience everyone (whether you like/play golf or not) must have. 

Golf: You are going to be spending between 25-45/hr for a bay which can accommodate 6 golfers. So if you are with others that total is split, not per person. Depending on if you are there for actual practice and competition or just for fun 1.5-2hrs is good for parties of 4+, where 1-1.5hrs will be sufficient for parties of 1-4. What usually ends up happening is you're having such a great time you want to stay longer. Targets are 90% accurate I would say. Every now and then you will get a ball that you see go in a target and you are not awarded points for it. As far as clubs go you can bring your own (minus drivers/woods) or use the clubs provided which are sufficient unless you are serious about golf.

Food: This is the biggest surprise to everyone but the food here is fantastic. Everything we have had has been great. From turkey club sandwiches, burgers, wings, nachos, queso, and buffalo chicken sliders.  We have yet to order something we have not thought we would order again. Food is also pretty pricey. I'd say with appetizer, meal, and drink, you are looking to spend around 20-30bucks a person just on food.

Total experience is worth it but know you are going to be spending more than you would at a bowling alley, movie theater, or driving range. But...it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Went to this location for a holiday work function...pricing for around 1pm was decent and we could all share the hour (for the driving range game) so that was cool!!! Food was pleasantly surprisingly good, lol! I ordered the shrimp and grits- which was yummos. My coworkers' burgers looked good, and tasted good. Customer service was excellent - our servers were quick and efficient!"}
{"text":"Very nice place. The staff was extremely helpful and courteous. Plenty of different types of golf challenge games to choose from. It's a little pricey. Food and drink especially. They also slip a $5 fee for every person and they don't tell you. It's a membership fee."}
{"text":"All around awesome experience! I was in town for a few days and brought my clubs. Didn't want to spend a whole day at the course but still wanted to hit a few balls. I am so glad I found Top Golf Las Vegas. Once I arrived I saw they offered golf lessons by professional instructors. So I scheduled with the training director Sean Solodovnick. I am relatively new to golf and wanted to rid of all my bad habits I picked up since starting. From the first few swings with Sean's adjustments I could fell the difference in my body mechanics. I went from tight and choppy to lose and smooth in an hour. It went so well I came back a few days later to see him again. Sean made learning the game of golf fun and interesting. He made a difficult task (golf swing) simpler to understand. Sean showed me what was causing my slice, which I could not change on my own. I couldn't be happier with my experience with him. I will definitely be seeing him again and Top Golf my next time in town."}
{"text":"This place is pretty rad. Def better than topgolf Atlanta. You could spend a pretty awesome afternoon/evening here and not even golf, that's how many activities they have. Cornhole, pong, TWO pools, tv's everywhere, multiple bars... all the things. Oh yea, the topgolf system is fun too (target/point based games against your friends). It's pricey, sure. Don't come here if you want to practice your swing and think it's a driving range facsimile, it's not. Don't get me wrong, it's fun for any level of golfer, but you're not taking your time and getting $5 buckets here. Overall, a great night out with (competitive) friends. Emphasis on night out. Bonus: employees were helpful and super friendly.

Note: do not dizzy from the top decks"}
{"text":"Loved this place! I hope Oahu opens up their own location too! Yummy food and drinks while you \"play\" golf? Why not??! I ordered the kalbi tacos 2x and tried their classic burger!"}
{"text":"Great time. The price is right and for me not being a golfer whatsoever I had a great time. Food and beverages are great as well. Great for group of friends"}
{"text":"I've never really been a fan of golf but this is completely different. It makes golf more fun. Not to mention the friendly staff and quick and tentative servers. I've been told by my girlfriend that I've been impatient when it comes to waiting for food and drinks at places. I couldn't remember one time where my drink went empty. This place exceeded my expectations of good customer service. We went on a Saturday night that usually has a long wait. Our wait was 2-1/2 to 3 hours which I though  was gonna be terrible. But with the Tv's, couches, heaters, and all the games in the waiting areas that time felt like only 30 minutes. Gotta say this is going to be my new favorite spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"Just got home from Topgolf Gilbert with a couple of my buddy's and this place is always a blast! The staff and food is great! Cambia, a manager, I believe?,(sorry, a few beers) came by and touched our table and told us if we needed anything to let her know. This place is a 1st class venue"}
{"text":"Can't wait to have more fun at Top Golf!  This is an incredible golf destination!

When I had difficulty on line, I called in and was transferred to the manager, Craig, due to a problem with the system.  

Craig was amazing - making everything work out.  Our 2 sons are arriving from California and wanted this to be special for them.  That's exactly what Craig did.

Can't wait for many more trips to Top Golf at Talking Stick in Phoenix

Thank you!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic time!  A couple of things...if you show up on the weekend without a reservation, be prepared to wait awhile--its packed!  However, the good news is, you can reserve your spot well ahead of time and it really does make the process super easy.  The price, when split among a group of 6 or more for playing time is honestly VERY reasonable.  The food is pretty good as well.  I can't comment on the drinks, but others in my group seemed to be enjoying theirs.  HIGHLY recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"My first experience was exceptional! We had a private buffet set up with delicious food and a very attentive and friendly server. I have now been back several times! Great for a night out with friends or family!"}
{"text":"The only downfall about Topgolf, is that there isn't more of them. What a great way to bring golfers and non-golfers together! Everything is interactive; it makes the game of golf a challenge for the advanced and fun entertainment for the novice. Make reservations if you can, it gets packed here and the wait can be all night if you're unlucky."}
{"text":"This place is a BLAST! Not what I expected. I'm not a golfer and my brother is and I smoked him at a few games. This place makes it an even playing field and super fun for all."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  Such a great place for meeting with friends, having drinks and their food is really tasty and well priced too!  The building is beautiful.  They really did a nice job with it.  The service was very good both in the restaurant and on the golf side.  I will say it gets VERY crowded so come early as you could wait a while for a bay.  The price for golf is a tad bit spendy...but they also offer memberships that could be an option.  It is a great place for families, couples or just about anyone.  I really enjoyed my first visit and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I had heard so much about TopGolf from friends in Atlanta that I could not wait for the Charlotte location to open. Simply put, it's a bowling alley for golfing. You can go and golf, you can go and drink, or you can go and do both! 

I went a couple weeks back with a group of about 12 guys the day before my wedding. We had to wait about an hour for a bay, but fortunately there is a full bar at your disposal while you wait. 

If it is your first time, you have to buy a membership ($5) and anyone that wants to golf is required to have one as well. The wait at the bar for a drink can be extensive, but of course that is due to the high volume of people, not necessarily the quality of the service.

Once the novelty wears off and the crowds thin out, I'm looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Very fun experience! Never went golfing but that's a fun place for first timers! I would love to go back again. And might even get in the pool! So much fun"}
{"text":"Great place that could be even better with a better staff! Both bartenders we encountered seemed annoyed to even serve us. We asked for waters to go with our drinks and the bartender made passive aggressive comments as we walked away. For being such a new place you would think they would not be so bitter about working there. We will give it one more try."}
{"text":"First time at TopGolf here in Vegas.  I signed up online for a membership (only $5 and it's lifetime).  I called to see about getting a card (per the website, said a membership card can be picked up at check-in).  The girl I spoke to said \"YES\" you can pickup your card.  When I got to TopGolf and asked for my card, I was told they don't give them out at the Vegas location.  Oh well...your cell phone number works as your card and is needed to login the computers anyway...so no big deal.  YOU MUST HAVE A $5.00 MEMBERSHIP TO PUT YOUR NAME IN THE COMPUTER (explained below).

PARKING -- there is no parking (didn't know this until we pulled in and guy who I thought was valet told us we had to follow the signs on Koval Ave to Valet).
It took a while for the shuttle to show up but it was only a 45 second drive back to TopGolf.
The shuttle back to the valet was pretty quick showing up.  Guess you can park at the MGM (locals park free until December :) )  We did valet at Wet Republic...or whatever it's called...I just followed the blue and white TopGolf valet signs on Koval and it took me right there.

It did seem confusing going in for the first time...MANY employees standing at the top of the stairs....they are the ushers I guess.   Just go to the check-in counter when you get there.  For our group I checked in and the others just met me at the bay.

We had 4 golfers and chose the lower level which was $60 per hour (plus the $5 for membership for EACH player).

EACH MEMBER WHO PLAYS AND PUTS THEIR NAME IN THE COMPUTER MUST PAY $5 (added to the bill).  We didn't know this when our group of 4 went.  You have to put in your name, e-mail and phone number in order to put your name in the computer.
The computer touch screen didn't work very well (bay 125) and had to wait or retype.  It took us a while to get 4 player names inputted.  If you're already a member, it only takes your phone number so suggest doing the membership online before you come.

The bays are pretty cool...seating for about 6 (at the bay we had).
There are electrical outlets and a shelf to charge your cell phones so suggest bringing your charger..it came in handy. 

The \"bay manager\" or waiter was nice but was hard to catch him...he seemed to have many tables and we were far from the bar which took longer for drinks.  They staff switched about 20 minutes into our stay and the 2nd girl was better but seemed overly busy.  I noticed many of the staff standing around near the lower level bay entry..not sure why...they stood there most of the night.   Suggest getting a bay close to the middle/near the bar if you want quicker service.  

Game play -- There are a variety of games to choose.  We played high score first...you just have to hit a ball into any target area, closer to the pin is more points.  The balls have sensors in them so that's how scoring is accomplished.  Quite a few times it took a while to register the score  and a few times it didn't register at all.  
The computer screen gives you info on all the games so you can choose the one you want.
The clubs are ok...not the worst.  I guess you can bring your own clubs if you're really serious about practicing your game.  My bro-in-law is a 0 handicap golfer and he did fine with the clubs they provided.  He hit the far net with driver quite a few times.  It's about 220 to the far net....but the screen kept saying 215 when the bar registered.

DRINKS ARE EXPENSIVE -- yep, it's Vegas...4 draught beers was $32.00.

OVERALL -- Hitting balls was fun...a bit pricey on the todal cost for me.  I'm hoping now that I'm a \"member\" that I'll get text and e-mail discounts or deals.
Turned out to be $180 with 4 golfers, 2 hours, with drinks.  We of course tipped pretty well.
The ladies who work there are very attractive too...just sayin'

MILITARY DISCOUNT -- 10%"}
{"text":"Top Golf is always a fun time, even for those who are not skilled golfers! There are many different game options that vary in difficulty. \"Top Score\" is a good game to begin with as you can get points anytime you hit the nearby red and yellow targets. 

I only wish that it wasn't so expensive, but both the Gilbert and Scottsdale locations are packed at night so I suppose it is reasonably priced. The best time to go is before noon. Bays are only $25 per hour in the morning, and their brunch menu is surprisingly good. Mimosa carafes are $20, and they don't skimp on the champagne. I enjoyed the Texas Brisket Hash Skillet. The smoked brisket was delicious! The breakfast flatbread and breakfast burrito were also popular. If you come for lunch or dinner, The Mac Daddy burger and Mushi are worth trying.

They also have a nice bar area to grab a couple of drinks while you are waiting for a bay or after you are done playing. There is a decent amount of seating and plenty of TVs."}
{"text":"Pro: Fun day activity that isn't drinking or gambling.

Con: Off the strip (took an Uber)."}
{"text":"Very nice location! Busy on weekend nights and has a good crowd. For $5 you can get the Topgolf card to play. I got a boca burger sandwich that was surprisingly good. They keep it cool outside with misting fans throughout. There is something to do for everyone! They also have accommodations for those who are left handed. Nice play to check out even if you're new to golf."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Top Golf. A family member recommended it to us for my brothers 21st bday in Vegas! We all had so much fun despite non of us being pro or avid golfers. We were on the first level (family level) as the second level (family level) and third level (21+) had an hour + wait. Staff was very informative and friendly! The area where you golf was comfy and private. Drinks were also good. Can't go wrong with Top Golf! Try it out and you'll have a lot of fun!!!"}
{"text":"Cool place. Food is reasonably priced but there are not alot of options. Everyone was really friendly and informative. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Super fun place. There's a shuttle that take you there and back from the MGM Grand hotel. 

It's a driving range, but in Vegas style, which means food, games, pool, and a DJ. Combined all of that with nice air conditioning in the dry desert heat, and you may not want to leave.

You get a lot of turns to hit the ball. Just wave the club over the sensor and new golf balls will pop out. Then, just hit into the open range. It's actually really hard; you need lots of power to get it on the green. The view is so nice; you can see the Vegas hotels and the linq ferris wheel.

It's one of the most popular attractions in Vegas now. Been to another topgolf in the US, and this one was definitely better.

Upstairs are table games and a really good DJ, the day we went. Jump in the pool when you get tired of golf.

Go earlier in the day for cheaper prices and fewer lines. The higher level you go, the more expensive it is. There's also a gift shop."}
{"text":"This was such a fun place with great service. Would highly recommend for large groups."}
{"text":"Super fun. Awesome location right off 101 with beautiful view of mountains and right next to Talking Stick. Perfect for anyone. Friendly service and great for anyone of any golf level."}
{"text":"Fantastic venue and excellent service! Our company hosted a private B2B event at Topgolf during our stay for an industry conference. Each of our guests were thrilled with the amenities, food, and gameplay. DJ and Raquel went above and beyond to make sure everyone was happy, comfortable, and satisfied. If you're out for a night with friends or want to throw a professional event I couldn't recommend Topgolf more."}
{"text":"This place it's awesome, a little expensive and quite the wait but worth it! Good drinks awesome food, great environment and amazing time. Our server Chad was fun. Got busy and disappeared for a while but still good. I expect nothing less when they are this busy."}
{"text":"I want to first off saying that I love top golf as a company, but not a fan of it in vegas. we went on a Monday night at around 10pm so we expected a small wait since it was the week after it opened. so we waited about 30min for a station, which wasn't too bad. I received a text saying our station was ready, they told me what station to go to and that an attendant was going to meet us there in a couple of minutes since they were so busy.so we went and waited and waited I waited for about 20 min and got up asked for help and they said theyd be right there and yet no one still showed up. now luckily ive been to topgolf in Austin twice so I figured how difficult could it be to set it up myself. 5min later we were playing golf. we got 45 min in and were done. still no one ever showed up, not even a waitress to take a drink order. ended up walking up to a random waitress to cash us out. so yea, I love  top golf on the grounds of I enjoy driving ranges but Im totally disappointed in the service that I received. would have thought that since I was in vegas wed be getting exception service hell any service."}
{"text":"I always have fun when I come here. I am by no means a golfer but the games are fun. My bf loves to golf. He has a great time and even with my lack of golf game I have a good time. However the service we received last night was awful. It took at least 10-15 mins for our server to get to us. We had already finished one game. We ordered one round. Sat with empty drinks for a bit. So we decided to get a pitcher so we wouldn't be left wanting. It came with a chipped glass. Had to walk around to find someone to fix that. It was replaced quickly. Then it came time to pay our tab. Our games we finished our time was up. Had to track down our server. I like to pay with cash. While I am taking out my money, haven't even put it down yet the server asked if I needed change. Rude. We probably would have eaten too but we were never asked if we would like anything and our server was nowhere to be seen. Five stars for fun. Zero stars for service. I left with a sour taste in my mouth. Train your servers better. I will not be choosing to spend my money here again."}
{"text":"We had never been here before, but myself and my group love golf and drive by this place all the time! We decided to stop by and a lovely young lady named Janet (from Pittsburgh) helped us and made us feel welcome and like family. She was very knowledgeable and provided us with the best customer service we've had all week. Next, our sever August showed the best customer service. He checked on us multiple times and even provided some awesome golfing advice! More places should have employees like Janet and August. I wish we could do more than just write you an amazing yelp review. You're awesome. We will be coming back a lot because of her."}
{"text":"Topgolf is a really fun place to go with your friends. You could go for any occasion. The people are friendly and you can just hangout and drink or golf while hanging with friends. It is a little pricey but it is a great place to have fun."}
{"text":"This place is Fantastic! The price is great - you pay per bay and play up to 6 people. Each persone pays a \"membership\" of $5.00 but if you ever go again you won't have to pay as it is a lifetime membership. The food and drink prices were great. Most of our group had never golfed other than putt-putt and we all had a great time. Service was wonderful and we didn't have to wait long for our bay. There are bars and cornhole boards to keep you occupied until your bay is ready. The prices change with time so if you want the cheapest price go before noon! We played on level 2 and it was great. Level 3 is more expensive and the bays are a little more posh but for us level 2 was perfect. there is a pool etc on the 4th level. If you are on the Strip you can take a shuttle right from the MGM lobby in the TopGolf Lounge - it is complementary.

Visited June 2016"}
{"text":"I watched this place being built and as an absolutely golf NUT, I was definitely excited to go check it out. It was pretty cool...a great way to get people who probably wouldn't otherwise golf to pick up the club's in a competitive, fun, drunken environment. 

TONS of great food and drinks, music, shade and a misting system.

It wasn't at ALL cheap and it was kinda Mickey Mouse for true golfers...But for what it's meant to be it is definitely a fun time."}
{"text":"For people wanting to come here for a relaxing, fun night with friends, I suggest not to go here. 1. The prices are very high for an hour. 2. The people are NOT helpful when it comes to trying to learn how it all works. And 3. A waitress named Kylee, is very rude. I was casually playing a game with my group of 10 friends when we accidentally had more than 1 golf ball out at a time. She got in our personal area and took the balls and threw them over so we couldn't use them anymore. We had paid for our time and the use of the golf balls. It's absurd how a WAITRESS, not even a Top Golf employee, has the ability to do that. She was out of line and approached us with aggressive behavior."}
{"text":"Top Golf is a pretty cool place, good for kids too. They do have pretty outrage waits on weekends, but we usually go Sunday mornings and have no trouble getting a bay. The staff is polite, but not super friendly. 

The only beef that I have with this place is that the fans on the bays are super obnoxious if you have long hair. I get it though, we live in the desert."}
{"text":"My fiancé recently held one of his bachelor party events at Top Golf. I wanted to send a few buckets of beer as a gift to him and his friends, and worked with Alishia who was absolutely amazing. She was extremely friendly and professional and totally made the day. Thank you again!"}
{"text":"Topgolf was simply AMAZING! I have been procrastinating this anticipated visit here and one of my girlfriends came down from San Diego this past weekend and suggested it! I thought well what else better time?! I heard that Sunday's were pretty good here especially with all the HUGE TV screens to watch the games! When you walk in it's almost unbelievable that you are at a golf course. Now as far as the pricing goes for golfing it most definitely is on the pricey side so be ready to spend! I wasn't too much concerned about that because we were here for the food and drinks while soaking up one hell of a scenery! Once we parked at one of the table tops on the 3rd level we were immediately greeted by such a sweet server! I really had to give them these 5 stars by how impressed I was with the professionalism and how helpful all the staff we encountered were! The design of the place is immaculate and I'm betting the best Topgolf location appearance wise that currently exist! The food was so good and we were especially recommended the flatbread! Along with that we also ordered a couple rounds of some simple vodka tonic's and those too were made just right! Even though I'm not a golfer AT ALL, I can't wait to return for a round of non competitive fun with my friends!"}
{"text":"I love Top Golf! Came here from Portland, OR area for vacation and went and played a few games. Also had the buffalo sliders and pickle fries. Such good food and fairly priced!"}
{"text":"This is a great atmosphere, I went with some friends I do business with. I think its more cost effective with at least 4 to 6 in your group. I would recommend going at night when the Casino is lit up in the background. They have their own clubs but the grips are expectantly worn. I'm going back for sure. JJ."}
{"text":"Coolest place ever! I'd never seen such a thing and am by no means good at golf, but I even managed to beat my boyfriend in a round. We need these in CA."}
{"text":"Beautiful facility, exactly what Charlotte needed!! 

Love this location is the experience similair to newer facilities TX. Great concierge, food - quesadilla & wings were good and the price structure was on point. Plenty of parking including a valet option. 

Only feedback I have for management is about the tall tables that are behind each couch. They need to bolted to the floor. We didn't realize the height of them and closeness to the couch. I sat down and hit my head pretty damn hard (headache worthy). Apparently the next table over did as well. Since the tables aren't taller than the average height of person sitting in front of it, causes easy issue. Until they fix it, just push it back into the isle, so its not a buzz kill."}
{"text":"The most fun you can have at a driving range while drinking and partying.  Not a place to go to work on your game, but to make golf a different kind of game.  The way they keep score is awesomely fun and makes golf social in a different way, probably helping to bring women into the sport, can you gamify a game?"}
{"text":"While waiting for our golf bay to open up, Ryan was our bartender/server and he was so awesome! Great service, fast drinks and lovely eyes! Super personable and he answered all of our questions and was very funny. Golfing here was awesome and super fun. Would recommend coming here to anyone visiting scottsdale. The only bad thing about this place was that it's a long wait but it's worth it for sure!"}
{"text":"Told it was a two hour wait. Level three was half empty. I would have paid to golf(ish). Asked a few times and was told that there was a party coming. Probably won't come back, and in a local."}
{"text":"First time here, and our experience was amazing! The customer service was awesome, the food was great, and...drinks! We brought our own clubs, but actually used several of the provided Topgolf clubs because they hit really well. Can't wait until the Topgolf in Columbus is completed, so we can make this a regular thing. Oh, and they give a military, police, and fire discount!"}
{"text":"The entire family had a great time.  None of us are golfers, but we all had a blast.  The staff was attentive and very helpful.  The pitcher of beer was a bit pricey for their premium, but overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Went here for a work event a few months ago. The place is huge. It's quite a walk from where I was to the venue, but it'd be easily around 5 minutes by taxi. Once you get to MGM, you have to walk inside for awhile to find it. But it's several levels, with each vestibule having its own table and golf accessories. It's pretty fun once you get the hang of it. You can either do strictly driving range or some type of points based system with targets (where you're just trying to hit targets, not long drive). Since it was a work event, there was a ton of free food and drinks. They had buffet style inside and the staff was always walking around taking drink orders (there was a bucket of beers waiting when you got to your station). They were also really accommodating if you had any questions or concerns. I'd definitely come back sometime (you even get some type of discount coupon when you initially sign up, which is free)."}
{"text":"Ok, so as a Vegas local, there is always something NEW and SHINEY in town.  From a new bar, club, restaurant, show....or whatever.  Most of the time, these new things fall outside the realm of family friendly.

Bars and clubs...obviously not family friendly with pre-teens or teens
Restaurants...so often really want to go, but don't feel like shelling out 50 a head for a 13 year old.
Shows... just expensive most of the time.  

But TopGolf was Great!  My wife and I took our son and it was fantastic!  Yes, it was not cheap entertainment for a Saturday night (would have been better Wednesday Afternoon) But the place is just tremendous.

Ok...So for the good.  The space is fantastic.  The Technology is Sweet, the bay's are well cooled / heated and the view is great.  6:30 on Saturday night and we got right in to a bay, got drinks ordered, food on the way, and a well run preview of how all the technology / games worked.

The almost good - Apparently, the terminals were all supposed to be hard wired in but some were still running wirelessly.  This presented an issue for a space where there appears to be a lot of competition for bandwidth...but they mentioned that this should be worked out by next week.

The almost good - Sorry to say, but most of the food was good , adequate , passable , ok.  The fish sliders were the best, while some of the other dishes were ok, and some were obvious filler.  Ask your server for recommendations, and hopefully they will get this worked out.  The doughnut holes were really good...

The really good - The technology of the driving range makes this like nothing you've done before.  Its not just grip it and rip it and the cross over Golf/Bowling/Darts kinduve thing makes it really fun.  

The Exceptionally Great - Ok, lets be honest. You know what you get when you have Las Vegas with mediocre service?  yup...Atlantic City.  So the bar is pretty high for service around here and TopGolf has Service In Spades!  Everyone was friendly, helpful, smiling, and as a general rule, really were proud to be there... Highlight of the night was Margo L.  Who gave my son some pointers on the game (she's got a great swing) and we just loved the way she took care of us in the way that \"regulars\" and \"high rollers\" are treated in this town...despite being anything BUT.

I've had a number of customers and clients tell me that they are excited about TopGolf coming to Vegas and they all want to go when they come to town.  I'll be sure to ask to be assigned to one of Margo's Bays.  She's every bit the superhero her cape implies!

So, yeah, there are a number of really nice reviews here.  In Vegas, that's important.  In Vegas that is EVERYTHING.  And when you can impress locals...you've done a great job!

So, next time, make a space in your schedule to hit up TopGolf Las Vegas.  Its one of 2 of their 3rd Generation Ranges and well worth your visit!

Oh...and one more thing...they are open until 4am on The weekends...seriously?  Finally something for those of us who want to go all night, but don't want to do it at a 20.00 a drink club."}
{"text":"Great place to come and hangout. Love the games they have and the concept of the whole golfing and scoring points. Can be pricey but if you go with a group the price goes down per person."}
{"text":"Top Golf was a blast. They have more then enough people on staff to make sure that questions are answered and that you have service at your tee area for drinks. Everything is reasonably priced. 

We went in the evening when the lights were on which was fun. Shot off the second story. 

Things to consider:
- Didn't know you have to have a lifetime membership first before reserving a tee. It's just $5, and I recommend doing it online before you get there. 
- With 6 people, one game lasted us about an hour. So figure out a good pace for playing."}
{"text":"i really wish i knew about this place earlier. what a beautiful environment to stumble into.

a very calm and fun place to play golf. i came for the bar, and a food menu. 

the wings were out of sight, they were coated in garlic sauce, which was a really nice touch. the service was super friendly."}
{"text":"We went to Topgolf to celebrate my daughter's 19th birthday. This was our first time going to Topgolf so we had no clue what to expect. However, everyone was super helpful and very friendly. My daughter had on a \"It's My Birthday\" Sash, so every employee who saw her came over to wish her a Happy Birthday. Her, her best friend, and a manager even did the \"Wobble\" when the song came on. Jenny took us to our bay and explained the game to us, she was super sweet. Michelle checked in on us all night to make sure our birthday girl was having a blast and at the end of the night she made sure we had a family picture. Dan, our waiter while we were in our bay, was absolutely amazing! He continually checked in on us and was super attentive to the birthday girl. He was even kind enough to take a picture with her and her best friend. He is a total doll and an amazing young man! Peggy Sue started us off right while we were waiting for our bay. The employees made sure to talk with each of us at the table (including my son and aunt) and even encouraged my son to apply and come to an interview next week. Thanks Topgolf for making our experience such a great one!"}
{"text":"Third time here, it's always fun. Great service. Bit of a long wait, but that's because everyone wants to play! There's cornhole, pool, and a couple other games in case you have a long wait."}
{"text":"Awesome fun on a Saturday night. Our first time. The wait was long, but expected (3 hrs +) But there was so much to do while we waited. Good food and drinks, pool table, shuffle board. Definitely going to go back. Bring this to San Diego."}
{"text":"This is a really fun and different way to kill a few hours with friends ... Maybe you don't want to be stuck inside a movie theatre or bowling alley, but you still want to be active...  What better way than to hit up a driving range?  And if that driving range had fans/misters blowing on you (heaters in the winter), music playing and has servers bringing you good food and drinks at fair prices, how could you pass that up?!  You can put up to 6 players on one lane and split the hourly rate amongst you to make it really affordable, even at peak prices.  Be warned they get very busy on weekend evenings and its not uncommon to wait 2-3 hours for a lane.  So be prepared to spend time at one of their bars or have some food while you wait. You can also play pool, shuffleboard or Nintendo Wii games on the second floor while you wait for your lane to open.  They weren't letting people bring their own clubs for a while, but that may have changed.  Call to be sure."}
{"text":"Average average average.  I really can't think of a better way to describe it.  Going 2/5 only because the marketing team did too good of a job overhyping this place.  Which made my last few experiences underwhelming

The concept is a great idea but waaaaay over commercialized.  Expensive food and drink for the quality and at $45 an hour for a bay after 5pm it just doesn't make much sense.  

Fun idea, poorly executed.  You'll have more fun at a local driving range for half the price.   And no 2.5 hour wait!


Final note - parking is horrible here.  Not sure what the developers were thinking when they designed this place but hope they didn't get hired again"}
{"text":"I am not a golfer but the service was great.  The food was good and they have a full bar.  I really enjoyed my 2 hours."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the staff. Could have been a bad day for them but it was difficult to have a pleasent time because of them."}
{"text":"Bring gloves. I got blisters on my hands after just one hour of golfing. I'm a complete amateur, so I have no idea what good form is. However, I had a good time trying to aim for the targets and seeing how many points I could score. 

If you get here early, you might not have to wait two hours to play. Morning prices are lower than night prices.  The lower levels 1 & 2 are cheaper than the upper level 3, where you have to be 21.  It's nicer on the third level anyway, despite having to pay more.  They have a lounge and bar on the main floor.  You can play with bean bags while you're waiting. Restrooms are on each floor; I love that. Every player must pay a one-time $5 membership fee. 

I can't say much about the food or drinks because I didn't have any.  But the servers are nice.  Each bay has heaters; I love that, too!  You do not have to bring any clubs. They have some available, but I didn't care to learn what they're used for or when to use a particular one.  The system is very user friendly.  You can have up to 6 players but 10 people in a bay.  

This is next to the MGM hotel, and parking is free. I'd recommend this place if you need something to do in Vegas.  But like everything else, it gets pricey."}
{"text":"I've currently gone to Topgolf twice.The first time I went in the evening on a Saturday and there was a four hour wait.We literally received the text that our bay was ready after four hours but we had already left.However,while waiting we did enjoy the bar and food.I ordered the smoked apple bacon sandwich and it was to perfection.My friend ordered the macaroni bacon roll and stated it was good too.Our bartender Mike was awesome!There was a large crowd at the bar but he was able to handle it and still provide great service.

The second time I went on a Saturday midday.The wait was 2.5-3hrs wherein we did receive a bay in the expected time frame.We enjoyed the bar once again while we waited.The actual game is so much fun and way better than putt putt golf.We truly enjoyed ourselves and shared many laughs.The waitress for our bay was on point and served us effectively.Overall,we didn't have any complaints and will be back for another game.I recommend this place for any occasion."}
{"text":"I would give them no stars if I could. We got there at 11:45, with plenty of stalls available they told us it would be a 15 minute wait. They made us wait till 12 so that they could charge us the increased noon rate. What a joke! Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Too busy on a Saturday...I used to go to clubs in Scottsdale when I went to ASU a long time ago. Not only will will this give you some awesome drinks and areas to drink it in, you can take you aggressions out on some balls in the meantime! 

We came here on a Saturday at 730 during spring training and if you do the same just plan on drinking 3 hours before you get your spot to hit balls! When you do you'll find the place you love to hit when it comes to lighted targets and a computer that shows you the way that you hit. Enjoy that! 

As far as the people, awesome. Just plain awesome. You don't have to be ready to club, you just have to be ready to talk. Lots of hot singles here, get ready to go. I met a lot of hot girls here! Enjoy your time!"}
{"text":"If you ever wanted to golf with Fido by your side, Topgolf in Scottsdale is your place.

The recently opened driving range lets you bring your canines along for the ride, who can relax on cushioned couches as you bounce off balls into targets throughout the range.

Its dog-friendliness isn't its only draw. Anyone will have fun at Topgolf, whether you're a pro with the sticks or not. Each hole has its own misted and fanned lounge area, with servers delivering drinks and food as you compete against your friends.

There are full bars on both golfing levels, as well as a rooftop bar, and fire pits and extra lounging areas give a great view of Valley sunsets, making it a bonafide Scottsdale rooftop bar contender.

For those who do golf, up to six people can compete against each other to score points by hitting balls into one of the netted areas. Rates are hourly, after you pay a $5 membership fee. It's $25/hour between open-noon, $35/hour between noon-5 p.m. and $45/hour between 5 p.m.-close. Divided by a group of six, that's not too bad, and I loved it as a new fun alternative to group bowling.

Something I wasn't a fan of was that woods and drivers are not allowed, only irons. A driving range where you can't use your driver?! Yep.

Apparently too many people were hitting the ball over the fence into Talking Stick Resort area. Bummer.

Still, it's pretty darn awesome to hit balls in cool air to Top 40 music."}
{"text":"Super fun for night out with friends! Def. a group activity with drinks and music! Think old school cosmic midnight bowling revamped as a driving range! It's always a long wait on Friday/Saturday nights but that's expected no matter where you go out. Will return!"}
{"text":"first visit to Top Golf!  we had a blast!  the food was really good - the service was excellent (thank you Anthony!)  we will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This was so fun!!! Definitely recommend! All of the staff were friendly and very helpful. One is opening in Nashville and we will make a trip to play again."}
{"text":"As a local, I am so happy to have this spot. Went for a business mixer and it was the perfect location. An alternative to bowling, this is a fair price activity for a group (excluding food and drinks). It was well planned for folks to socialize and move easily through the space. While there are sounds and screens everywhere, it wasn't overwhelming. The food was really delicious - mac n cheese, brisket, and pulled pork. For parking, it is limited at TG; however, it's a few minute walk from the MGM garage. Service was also attentive for it being a busy weeknight."}
{"text":"Had a great time, the wait was two hours but there were a lot of open bays, they could tighten that up and be more predictive, and service more customers, even tho they have lots to do while you wait.

FOOD, got the fried chicken sandwich, there was a middle bite that was very weird (maybe raw) about 4 hours later, I'm sending this from my towlet were I have, been for about 1:2 hour throwing up and ...... You know. Very sick!!!"}
{"text":"If at first you don't get in, try, try again! This is what I told myself after visiting the first time on a Saturday night only to learn that it was a three-hour wait for a bay (the private golf areas). The next time we tried to visit, we came at a down time and luckily scored a bay right away! I'm so excited to see a place like Top Golf come to the Valley. My only question is, what took them so long and why don't other fun entertainment spots like this open up more often!? 

Golfer or not, this is a really fun time and it's family-friendly so Mom & Dad can have a cocktail while the children play! It's like a driving range meets a bar meets a golf arcade. Now, if you are a golfer, you might never want to leave and if you aren't a golfer, this might kick start you into wanting to play. We had a lot of fun and can't wait to continue to visit, especially when the weather cools down!

Here's how it works. 

1. First time you visit, you will go to the check-in counter and buy a card for $5. This card will serve as your license to golf and that means you can bypass the first counter on your next visit. You will also pay for the first hour which varies in price depending on the time of day: $25 an hour (total, not per person) from open until Noon, $35 an hour from Noon-5 and $45 an hour from 5:00 until close. 

2. After you've signed up and purchase your card and first hour, they send you over to the concierge where they will set you up with your bay or put you on a wait-list depending on the time of day. 

3. Now that you're set up, you can head over to your bay and start to play. The bay comes with golf clubs and a private area with couches and misters so even if you don't want to play, you can still hang out and watch! 

4. The bays run by the hour, so when your hour is up, you can pay for another half hour or hour right at your bay, making it easy (and pricey!)

5. You will get your own server at your bay and they offer a full bar and full menu of tasty food.

*** If you just want to come and drink, they also have a full bar set-up so you don't have to rent a bay. ****


Tips:

1. If you're a golfer, you can bring your own clubs. 

2. If you like to play with a glove, bring it with you. 

3. Wear comfortable clothes. 

4. You don't need golf shoes but I suggest you wear closed toed shoes. I played in flip flops and it wasn't very fun. 

5. If you don't want to play golf, you can still hang out with your friends in the bay while they play."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  The whole idea is just brilliant.  I can take the kids and have a good time golfing at the same time, it's the best of both worlds.  Food is also very good.  Recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Such a good idea, a little pricey especially the food but love the atmosphere they provide and create"}
{"text":"While there is so much about Scottsdale to love, add to this list a Topgolf location! (Soon coming to my hood, Virginia Beach, VA.) This was a nice way for me to finally experience this before having to wait hours and hours of waiting with the soon to open location in my hometown.

This is an experience. For an avid golfer like myself, I sometimes wonder how things like this will fare on a fun scale. Putt putt golf isn't fun. Could this be a glorified driving range? Not so much. It's really just a fun thing to do, golfer or not. Heck, even if you're not a golfer, you can just come out for food and drinks. Think Dave and Buster's with a golf club.

First, it's gorgeous. Lots of green, lots of lighting, lots of bins so you can have endless groups enjoying their time together. You hit into targets and based on how close you get to your target, you're awarded points. For folks that aren't good at golf and simply make contact, the ground is hard enough where your ball can roll into the hole for points (where golf on a golf course requires you to hit the ball in a specific direction and with hazards and natural terrain, a specific distance), thus making it enjoyable for anyone to score and compete in their many games.

The cool thing about playing at this location in the evening is the Talking Stick Resort in the background. Bright and continuously changing and waving lights emit the building and makes for something pretty to look at with the already pretty golf design of the driving range.

Could this be a weekly adventure for me? I think so. :)"}
{"text":"So much fun. Now get me to a real golf course. I want to play golf. Fun fun fun.  Deep Eddy Vodka thank you. I am sure that's why I was
so awesome"}
{"text":"Cool spot to hang out and chill with friends. It can get a little pricey if you're not paying attention to your times at the golf bays. The servers and attendants were friendly and helpful as well."}
{"text":"Wow!!! What a place. Took the kids here after Easter Brunch and had a great time. Can get a little pricey if not careful.  It took me an extra order of doughnut holes to convince them to leave!"}
{"text":"Never done before was fun need to extend the far fence. Very nice facility and the food was good too. Would go back"}
{"text":"We have followed Chef Shaun to all the restaurants he has opened and top golf is just another hole in one... We came last night and played golf for 2 hours while drinking beer and perfecting our shot. This was the perfect way to learn and practice in a fun environment. The food is even better, each meal has its own perfection point and surprisingly our favorite dish was the pizza and its juicy finish. The dessert was a playful and delicious finish to get us stuffed. Slam dunk Chef Shaun \"Lebron\" Schuette!"}
{"text":"Cool Spot To Play With Friends

This was my first visit to top golf in Gilbert Arizona. We had been to the Scottsdale location before and thought we would give this one a try since the friends we are meeting lived a lot closer to this location in Scottsdale.

We only had to wait 15 minutes which was pretty acceptable, I was surprised however how busy it was on a Thursday night so I would imagine making the reservations would be a smart idea if they take them on a Friday or Saturday.

The prices are $40 an hour at night to rent your bay, but it turned out to be $45 after-tax or whatever it was.

Our waitress was friendly, she kept stopping by regularly to make sure we didn't need any refills or anything else. The staff was all nice and polite and our experience was good."}
{"text":"I had never been to a driving range before. I have to say it was pretty fun and I liked how the machine kept score so you could play against your friends. 

I am not a pro golfer by any means but we had a good time. 

the waitress was super friendly... I would give her a shout out but do not recall her name, only that she attends ASU.... That really doesn't narrow it down much... Lol....

We stayed a couple hours and one thing I can say is it was not super cheap.... Still a good time."}
{"text":"This place was so much more fun than I expected! I started as a newbie golfer (as in I've never played anything other than mini golf) and left with a drive of 93 yards and could even hit the targets! Seriously, I was super impressed with my golf skills, and I'd totally come back, though earlier in the day when the prices are lower, or to a location that's not in Las Vegas. We ordered a few food items while we there, and quite a few cocktails, and I'm only knocking of a star because some of the items on the pretzel board were totally funky tasting. The salami was horrible as was whatever was in the plate that looked and tasted like raw bacon. Overall though, a great time was had by all, and the service was great too! (Though it really pays to be nice you know?)"}
{"text":"My husband and I are huge fans of topgolf.. but we both agree that this location is an absolute disaster. We will give it another shot in a few months."}
{"text":"Place is beautiful and build and designed really nice. Technology of all the golf system is great. Staff were not so nice and were slow , not much options on the food menu.
Must clean the court from all the balls , too many cause when we try to hit the target our ball always hit other people's ball , there are so many! 
A little expansive too"}
{"text":"We went in Friday afternoon and were told it would be a two hour wait so went into the bar area to have some drinks. We sat at a table for 45 minutes before we gave up and left because no one came to take our order. We understand it was busy but there were servers all over, even serving the tables next to us (who sat down way after we did) but waiting almost an hour and still not being taken care of is not okay. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Newly modeled driving range with good music, alcohol and food.
There aren't a lot of places like this in North America, absolutely
a highlight of our trip to Arizona (about a 10 min cab ride from Scottsdale).
From what I have seen this place can get bumpin' on the weekends
and is a really great pre-game option before heading to a club."}
{"text":"Was on the second level and the ground level and enjoyed hitting shots with several friends. The food and drinks were ok but atmosphere was good and fun. Frendly staffers. Prefer the higher floors."}
{"text":"Pretty fun! Love the dual pools, bar food, and the golfing is pretty cool. Try to show up early on busy weekends or holidays if your party is smaller than 6 to grab a nice spot. I'm hoping the parking structure is finished soon, it's getting a bit too hot to walk from the back when valet is full."}
{"text":"Had a blast my first time. Estefania set us up in our bay and kept my friends and I laughing the whole time. She is the best and i'm not just saying that because she is beautiful. This is a completely unbiased review... The golfing process was very easy to pick up and just a great time all around! Loved the reggae band. The bill was a challenge to split at the end of the night with drinks and food but we were able to get it worked out. I'll def be back!"}
{"text":"Fun place but be prepared to spend a grip of money here. We had a group of 4 playing on a Sunday afternoon and not only did the bill come out to $150 but they also charged us a reservation fee. Watch out as this is a true FEE and doesn't even go towards your game play. You just pay it, period. That was a bit disappointing. 

Other than being way too expensive we actually had fun and would like to go again but will be very careful about what we spend there. Definitely a family friendly place but I can't imagine most families could afford it."}
{"text":"Love this place!  It's like playing Tiger Woods live!!"}
{"text":"Fun place, food, drink and driving range, good combo, lot of money walking around. The only complaint is the barrage of emails you will receive after your visit."}
{"text":"This was an awful experience due to the fact that was a long line just to pay for a $5.00 membership and wait 2.5 hours to play. The Bar area was bad as well bad service over all. This management needs to get a better customer service acknowledging potential customer. Bad, bad don't go there on a holiday or weekends. Never go there."}
{"text":"Very unique place. Golf is the theme hence the name. Pools, bars, great set of TV's and lots of places to hit golf balls. Those are all positive now the cons....
Very hot today and unbearable in some areas......where minimal clothes, wine selection limited, price of drinks unbelievable.....draft $7......a house vodka and mixer 17.56 plus tip. I'm thinking ridiculous...... honestly geared toward MGM /convention tourist. Vegas and Henderson has some really good golf courses/ cheap driving ranges. You can do better unless a stag party/birthday then maybe it might suit you. Pricey...."}
{"text":"I've been to topgolf several times since they've opened and it's always been a really fun time. There are many reasons that make this place fun including the golfing, ping pong, pool and just the overall atmosphere is really cool. It can potentially be pricy but if you are splitting the costs of the bay with a large group then it can actually be really affordable. Anticipate a minimum wait of an hour and half to two hours on a busy Friday or Saturday night though. 

The only thing that they can definitely improve on is the food. All of the food is what you would consider \"bar food\". Very greasy and not that fresh. I can understand why people would like this type of food to go along with golfing and beer but I feel like they have a good opportunity to really step up their game with the food."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.... fun for adults, for for kids. Wish there was one in SoCal, I would go all of the time!!!! They have a very easy check in process. No need to bring clubs (but you can if you'd like to). I think like 16 different golf games to play in your assigned section. Booze. Helpful staff. Sports playing on TV. A POOL. At night sometimes a DJ. Did I mention BOOZE! This place is so much fun and really it doesn't matter if you're trying to go pro or just trying to hit a golf ball into ANY of the playing fields, you're going to have a great time. Food there is less than stellar so go with a full belly or just expect to eat like bowling alley food... overall I highly recommend going here and just doing something fun and inclusive with other peeps. TopGolf please bring us some options to Claremont, CA!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good golf, drinks and fun. Can't complain. Bit pricey but you get what you pay for! Yelp wants me to say more so ya it good, it's great it fabulous, its amazing, it's remarkable, it's spectacular, it's Top Golf!"}
{"text":"I am a local and native of Las Vegas.

The venue is nice and the concept is very fun but you can only valet park or you have to walk from the MGM; just like I have to choose a star even though I would give this business NO STARS. 

And if you want to be told what you can and cannot afford, then you might enjoy Top Golf!! Upon ordering food with our server and expecting it to come out we then find out the kitchen closed with no last call but our server took our order like it was okay. Once the manager got involved and said, \"we apologize for your server not informing you of the kitchen closing, we will get the order in complimentary.\" Long story short the server brought a bill to the table even though management said it would be complimentary. Upon clarifying with her she responds, \"I knew that was going to happen, I knew someone like you wouldn't pay\". Not sure if it's cause I'm African American but the bill was not paid and the food was returned to the kitchen since I couldn't afford it. Even a manger who was African American couldn't get me to change my mind. Thank you for attempting to be my accountant, but I didn't go for that purpose! 

I will not recommend to anyone and not interested in helping resolve the issue because I will not even come 50ft within this place when I have to consider that I will be discriminated against ... I'm almost turned off that MGM name has to be dragged through the dirt cause of this place. Created a Yelp just to post this so thank you for allowing me to rant and inform others of this prejudice and stereotypical business."}
{"text":"What a great place to go to as an option when you're in Vegas besides the gambling, shows etc. Place to hit golf balls with your friends and family enjoying both alcoholic and regular drinks. Mix that with music and huge displays at the end of the range. Night time can be crowded probably because it's less hot at night but you also get the lights here. The thing that makes this place fun is that they have different targets to hit where you can earn points to play against your friends/family. Easy to set up on the monitor when switching between players and easily wave the club in front of the ball dispenser to get started.

It can be a bit expensive per hour but it makes it worth it with more people so you can easily split the cost. Besides drinks, they also have food here you can order. Place is also kid friendly as we took our 22 month old daughter here at night. Only bad thing in my opinion about this place is the parking. Yes you can get shuttled from MGM Grand but if you're driving yourself and not staying/visiting MGM, you'll get lost finding the parking spot here. Just look for a sign off Harmon that says DO NOT ENTER and park in this lot. Most people park here if you're not using their valet services."}
{"text":"Top golf is a wonderful experience. I went to the Vegas location once with friends and had a great time. During my honeymoon, my wife wanted to check it out. We had a great time. The food and service was excellent and I golfed better than I do on the golf course. Something about relaxing and drinking beer and eating good food makes me golf better. We just need one in Southern California!"}
{"text":"We went to see the pink Floyd cover band when we got there we asked to park at the handicap which is the closest to the entrance, the wouldn't let me ,I have a problem walking because I had a knee surgery. The had few available but the parked my car far .
When we went to get the car I was waiting for over 20  minutes in pain till my wife spoke to the guy in charge the brought me a chair to seat  .next day we called to speak to a manager, we left  a message, no one called us back. Thank you top golf for taking car of handicap customers."}
{"text":"I went there with a few friends this summer for an evening of golf fun and I have to say that this is a pretty good place even though it is rather expensive.

This place is located by the MGM grand on Koval Lane and there is a free shuttle from the MGM's main entrance which is convenient. The place also offers a large parking lot so no worries about finding a parking spot. The place itself is huge and has dozens of bays from which you can play.

The food and drinks there are good but rather expensive. For example, a classic cocktail there is $20. The pricing on golfing depends on the time and on the floor that you want to play from so it'd be easier to just go on their website and look it up. Golfing there is really fun though and you get a great view of the strip.

In conclusion, I would say that this place offers a good quality/price ratio and I would recommend it. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!"}
{"text":"TopGolf is always fun, and this location is no exception.  We picked this location instead of Scottsdale assuming it would be less crowded and I am sure we were right.  The staff was nice and the facility was in great shape.  I don't love how you always have a server, as I come to hit balls and not to eat, but that is just how it is.  I usually tip a little for all the water fill ups but I would rather just be left alone.  Come before noon for the best pricing ($25 per hour)."}
{"text":"Shittiest people on the planet ! They will steal your money and they don't care about your well being write to me if you want proof my friend was robbed"}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! The place is amazing, the concept is cool. Location is great, atmosphere is like none other. HOWEVER, if you want to be treated like crap, this is he place for you. The staff is disrespectful and rude and clearly don't care to be in the customer service field. That and $90/HR for a driving range is outlandish!!!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place good food, great service, definitely one of my favorite Sunday Funday spot and only a parking lot away from the casino! THANK YOU DANIELLE FOR THE AWESOME EXPERIENCE! 

Avoid any guy in a neon green shirt with douchebag features, most likely gonna be rude and not know what they're doing :)"}
{"text":"The game is fun even for people who have no experience. Price for the games are reasonable. Food is a little over priced and drinks definitely overpriced but that is typical for this type of venue. My only complaint is the music is very specific for certain types of people. Definitely not the type of music men would enjoy/ my husband and all my friends husbands were complaining ! It is really loud booty music and you feel like you are in an uptown charlotte booty club! We also hosted our company party here in December it was a good time and the employees enjoyed it ! We have a staff of mostly women though- I'm not sure how the male corporate world would respond to the music blasted here !"}
{"text":"I had a family outing today and I called to find out all the information necessary. The only thing that was said was there is up to 8 players per pod and 6 players can play at a time by a gal named Tara. They charge by the hour,not per person. The prices are inconsistent and the wait time can be a bit long depending on the day. The lounge area allows you to play games in the meantime. Bing bag toss and shuffle board! Once you get in the pods are heated if needed, the directions are explained once you are at your pod. Everything else is game play from there on. The staff have been a bit robot like but respectable. This is a good outing for anyone."}
{"text":"SUPER SUPER NICE.  If you love golf then this is a must.  Totally kickasss.  Be there"}
{"text":"I went here on Sunday morning for my dad's birthday. They opened at 9, and my family (who has been here previously) told me to get here earlier because it will be super busy! So, when I arrived they had two lines; the first was if you already had a membership card and then second was if you needed a membership card. The card is only $5 and it last a lifetime. I paid for my card online the night before, so I only had to show them the email confirmation when I got to the register. Although the line for the membership was really long, maybe 30 minutes, I did not have to wait for a bay because my family was already waiting for me! The bag has a L-shape couch and a table to eat at as well as clubs for us to use (unless you are left-handed then they bring you clubs up). The floor was sticky... you can definitely hear it when you walked. When we sat down we began looking through the menu (because I was starving). I decided on the French toast! The picture looked amazing. The actually golfing is rather fun - even if you have never played before or in my case, suck at golf. I think my high score was around 48 points... anyways, my food has finally arrived! I felt like it took a while for it to come, and when it did we did not even have silverware. I took one bite, and was disgusted. The strawberries were great! The syrup was great! But the toast, was wayyyyy to burnt and hard! It was suppose to be fluffy, right? I had to send it back after only having one bite. I asked my family (we were in two bays) what they ordered before and if it was good - I didn't want to chance a bad meal again. I ended up ordering the buffalo chicken sliders (even though it was 10 AM). They arrived and looked delicious! It came with lettuce and tomato on the sliders, with a side of ranch for dipping. They weren't amazing, but I would probably order them again. Our server was eh, she didn't seem to check on us that often and when we wanted to order some drinks she never seemed to be around - we ended up starting a tab at the bar because we can never track her down. After about 2.5 hours I did not want to golf again, but I did want to stay to watch everyone play and enjoy the beautiful weather! A little after I stopped playing the ball dispenser stopped working! We grabbed a guy, he looked like a manager, and he walked over to our bay. We was very nice and was joking around with us! I cannot remember his name... but he added 30 minutes to our time because we had to wait. Then the screen went dead. Dead! We grabbed another gentleman, who looked like a manger as well. He told us the computer tech would be up in just a few minutes. It wasn't long and he was helping us! He basically had to reset the monitor and re-swiped the membership cards. Once he was done, he said he gave us a little bit more time. After playing about 20 minutes, we wanted to know how much time was left... when we checked he gave us 2 hours!! Overall, yes I would come here again. Do not expect the best waitress but their management staff is spectacular! And it is a bunch of fun!"}
{"text":"Soo much fun! I'm not a golfer at all but our bay hostess Hailey B was amazing and explained each game to us and even how to hold the club so we looked like we knew what we were doing. She went above and beyond and I would highly recommend requesting her, she made things so much fun and was super nice! :)"}
{"text":"I love Topgolf and this location is my all time favorite. I'm happy to see them pop up in other states.
First off I've never done any type of golfing other then putt-putt golf. So don't let this driving range scare you. You could kick a ball and probably get 1 point. It's such a fun place to go with friends or on a date.
This location can definitely get busy so plan to get there early on weekends and plan to have dinner or hang out awhile before you're able to play. So worth the wait though. This Topgolf has the beautiful lights of the casino in the background. And a shuttle if you don't want the night to end and want to go gamble."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas, looking for something fun to do so we decided to try this out. It was loads of fun. This was my first time ever holding a golf thingy...Lol and I had a ball not being able to hit the ball...Lol I ordered the Asian wings, they we just o.k. not cooked hard enough to my liking, but the flavor itself was good. All around it was fun, and I would definitely do it again"}
{"text":"We had an absolute blast here!! A very casual but fun way to golf with drinks and food. All employees were very helpful and we can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy Top Golf.  I'm not a great golfer but the atmosphere and the games always bring me back.  The Las Vegas Top Golf is so top notch as well with 4 floors, 2 pools, many big screens, and shuffleboard.  For $60 you get a bay for an hour, with up to 6 players.  But you can sit a full party down at each bay.  Drinks and food are pricey, with drinks in the $8 range for beer and $12 for drinks, and food around $15.  Overall I like Top Golf and will most definitely be back, hopefully for social events as prices seem to get out of hand when in tahat golf zone."}
{"text":"Horrible service! We had to wait 1 hour and 30 min for food and they didn't get everyone's meals even! My aunt left because they never got her meal and they could barely refill our sodas."}
{"text":"You have to know what you are doing when you come here. Read every single TripAdvisor suggestion you can. And then your experience may surpass mine, if you are lucky and smart.

Tip #1) IF you bring your teenagers, DON'T go above the 2nd floor with them or you will be immediately and rudely greeted by a server who is barely 21 himself that will promptly tell you to get lost and go back to the lower floors since upper floors are 21 and older only, for the ENTIRE floor. This is true even if you come at the beginning of March, on a Tuesday at 2 pm when nobody else is there on the entire floor. 

Tip #2) That prompt, rude, barely 21 year old that met you on the 3rd floor with your teenagers THE SPLIT SECOND before you could even sit down? Well, don't let the fact that he was so quick fool you about the actual service you should expect to receive here. Once we took the elevator back down to the under 21 level, it was a full 20 minutes until anyone thought about asking us if we even wanted a cool glass of water on this sunny 90 degree day. Not for lack of trying on our part! Trust me, we watched countless over 21 year olds even walk up to the bar in this level and try to order even their own ANYTHING and they were instantly told by the little blonde bartender that the server was way over on the other side of the room where she pointed and that she would be there to take our orders soon. Not to be deterred, I myself even went over and asked and was told the same thing. Then, I made eye contact more than 3 times, each time more seriously than the next, with other servers who walked about 24 inches from my face yet refused to look at or acknowledge me. I'm not sure who trains the servers here but they should all be fired for not even saying hello or sorry for ignoring you on this hot day in March. It was only after I texted the manager of the place that we at least were able to order. But this was a full 30 minutes after the 5 of us sat in a nearly empty and conspicuous area looking super hot, thirsty and hungry at 3:30 pm on a Tuesday in March.

Tip #3) Still reading? So everyone has ordered, finally some refreshing drinks arrive at the table 45 minutes after arrival. But wait! Only the kids sodas arrive! Hubby's and my pitcher of beer that we knew we had to order because we were unsure when we would ever see the waitress again in the next hour ... they happened to be changing out the Stella tap at the very moment our waitress asked for the pitcher. Ugh! So she couldn't even bring us some waters as a standby til the beer arrived, which I really needed by this time. I'm getting a headache just writing this... long story short nearly an hour after arriving, our beer and our food arrived at the exact same time! Yay!

Tip #4) Except for the burgers, you don't get much for your $. But hey! You never should have come here to eat in the first place! DUH! I got 3 tinee tiny Korean style tacos for like $14. I'm a tiny eater too, and my hubby and I ALWAYS split meals but altogether, end to end, I'd say these were the size of a regular sized Taco Bell taco, and I generally order 2 of those to feel full if that tells you anything:

I could go on... but there was a single silver lining to the whole experience... after all this, my husband and 14 year old golfing fanatics (because we live on a golf course in San Francisco) were able to get right into a Bay hit some balls. Of course by now it cos $60 per hour instead of $45. But then an extra $15 is nothing to us in San Francisco. In fact it is more than the tip we gave our MIA waitress after ordering $150 worth of food, which would have been double the order if she had come by any sooner than 45 minutes AFTER we arrived and sat down in her station where nobody else was at 2 pm on Tuesday on March 14, 2017."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night so it was quite busy. Garrett who was our host was awesome! Explained everything down to the tee. Get it? Lol. Just kidding. Yes, an awesome host and made us feel really comfortable knowing we do not know anything about golf except to aim and hit. I got lucky and got a hole in one! Scored! One of the farthest targets too! Different games to choose from. Beginners to intermediate. They have heat lamps in the bays so no need to worry about being chilly ( vegas winter) since it's an open air venue. Had so much fun with the ladies. Food was amazing and so were the cocktails. Only downfall, valet filled up quickly so you will have to park at the MGM parking garage. Paid parking per hour and top golf cannot validate it to get free parking. Wise to just car pool together there to save a bit of money so everyone doesn't pay $7 or more per hour... It's just about a 5-10 minute walk so no heels ladies! Shouldn't be in heels anyways if you are planning to play. Just saying. Have fun!!!"}
{"text":"We came here as the second part of my brothers bachelor party. This was my first time and an indoor/outdoor putting place. 
Only the guys \"played\" golf (hit the balls) the girls hung out at the bar next to them. We all had a good time .
The food was good we shared a few appetizers, we had the margarita pizza, nachos and some steak tacos. The bartender (I believe his name was) Chavez made an amazing margarita according to my mother in law who is a margarita expert. All in all we had a great time."}
{"text":"This review is mostly about the food, but the service and overall ambience are also contributing factors to the perfect score. Our group of 3 ordered the spinach and goat cheese salad, along with the Thanksgiving Burger, the Veggie Sandwich, and the Crab Cake Sandwich. Everything was absolutely awesome. One of the better crab cakes I've ever had--what a pleasant surprise! 

Great music selection, and even for me--a non-golfer--I was entertained. Misters and fans abound so you're sure to stay cool even in the heat of summer. Service was friendly, fast, and attentive. I found Top Golf to be an upscale-bowling-alley-meets-driving-range and I absolutely loved it. Original, fun, engaging, trendy.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"2 appetizers 1 pitcher of beer 1 lemonade 1 mock cocktail= 67.00...I think,we were over charged....pay attention to your bill....."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the atmosphere here! This is a great place to hang out with friends for food, drinks and to hit golf balls as far as you can. Plenty of TV's if you plan to make this venue your place of entertainment while an important game is on!

Prices are a little high in my opinion, but they're selling the experience I guess, so as to be expected. Food is great! I've tried the pulled pork sliders here and they're really good!

However, they make you buy a membership before you can even play; it's only $5, but I feel like it's a little unnecessary. Can't I just pay the inflated price of $75/hour? Which brings us to the next chapter of the review. Prices: Levels 1 & 2 are priced identically while level 3 charges a little bit of a premium. Levels 1 and 2 charge anywhere from $30 - $60 an hour depending on the day of the week, and time of day. Level 3 charges anywhere from $45 - $90 an hour respectively.

That atmosphere tho ..."}
{"text":"First time at TopGolf, staff was very good at making us feel welcome and understand how it worked.  Was able to get a bay very quickly and on the 3rd floor which was cool.  Angelo, our server, was AWESOME - helped with drink selection , food choices, and overall just super cool and we never felt rushed.  The watermelon margaritas were great as was the strawberry jalapeño margarita.  Nachos were great with red and green jalapeños , very very tasty.  Had a blast, can't wait to go to another one sometime."}
{"text":"This review is for the recent whiskey and spirits tasting event only. The set-up was terrible. Super long winding lines up 3 flights of stairs. It was very unsafe and very long. We waited nearly an hour. Once we got in we were encountered with more long lines waiting at each sampling table. Tables were set up in walk ways so you couldn't even get thru. You couldn't tell who was in line and who wasn't. They claimed there were free finger foods but I only saw 1 guy for about 39 seconds with a small tray what looked like spinach quiche. We waited in more lines than we actually got to taste them. Many tables ran out of product...which is unacceptable. Maybe next year they will learn from their mistakes. I will not return I will make a donation to the charity instead.

Shame on you top golf...you're better than this."}
{"text":"I went to top golf last night for the first time. And it was really fun. Everyone there was super nice. I just didn't understand why they had so many employees just walking/standing around doing nothing. When we got to the bay, our sever was... Okay. She left all the dirty dishes on the table and didn't clear anything off. I had to get up and push all the dirty dishes to one side of the table because she didn't remove anything. It was obvious that our waters were empty and she didn't refill them or ask if we wanted anymore. 

Overall I had fun, our server just wasn't the best. I will probably be back but I heard the service at the Scottsdale location was a lot better. I will go there next time."}
{"text":"All booked on a tuesday 5pm not taking any walk ins and lets people arrive In paid taxis let the taxi leave and turning people down outside was told 5 hour wait now having to pay for a taxi out $30 down the drain and they don't answer the phone to reserve 2 hours of calling prior thanks top golf great Mgmt"}
{"text":"$35-45/hr but it's a lot of fun. Good games to play for beginners and advanced. Good service and people are friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent place. Prices are fair and the food is great. Even for people that are not a fan of golf I feel like you can still have a great time. It is an absolute must . Can't say enough good things about this place"}
{"text":"Great location, facilities and potential, I'm always worried when pricing is not clear and this place, even the staff don't understand it,"}
{"text":"My friends and I went here a couple of days ago as we had heard a lot about it but none of us had been.  

The facility is really cool as it's a multiple-levels looking out into a driving range set up with different colored flags where you try to hit your golf balls to get points.

Cool concept and amazing that the system can track every ball you hit and exactly where it went.  Again, the facility looks amazing and the staff was very friendly.

The gameplay itself leaves a lot to be desired.  The game is played by each player taking 5 shots and trying to score by hitting it to different areas of the driving range.  None of us really figured out how the scoring system works (sometimes you get double points and also extra points if your partner scored in the same frame, etc...pretty confusing).  Also, I thought it would have been more interesting if the game \"forced\" you to try to hit to different targets.  But mostly it was trying to hit it to the farthest flag for the maximum points.

As for the food, while it tasted pretty good, the menu selections were pretty surprising given the setting.  Most of the food is \"fancier\" than typical bar food.  Also, most of the food are finger foods but very saucy/messy.  Now combine this with having to use one set of rental clubs that have been touched by every other player that's ever played, and you can see it's not the most sanitary way to combine food with golf."}
{"text":"Went here for the third time (and I already posted one review summarizing my bad experiences on the first two trips). Showed up at 9:30pm on a Wednesday night thinking we shouldn't have any problem getting in. They told us the top two floors were reserved for private events (even though there were probably 20 unused bays on those floors) and the bottom two floors had a 1.5 hour wait. Really? 1.5 hour wait on a Wednesday night at 9;30pm? Okay.

Anyway, we waited and played for a couple of hours. We spent $350 on food/drinks/golf. Our time ended sometime after midnight. No more than 5 minutes after we finished, an employee brings up the next group and tells us we have to leave. THERE WERE AT LEAST 10 OTHER BAYS OPEN ON THAT FLOOR AND IT WAS AFTER MIDNIGHT! You're going to kick us out and not let us even finish our drinks at the bay we were in? After we dropped $350? Piss poor customer service here. 

The employee that did it noticed that we were pretty upset about this and must have realized he screwed up because he kept apologizing, but we'd had enough at that point."}
{"text":"So fun! Awesome experience, great service and help with finding vegan options! Would definitely come back next time I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"They served us all beer at the bar without checking our ID's. They then denied one of us from drinking at the golfing bay because he had a vertical California ID, even though he just had a beer and he's over 21. Hostile staff kept an eye on us for the rest of our visit."}
{"text":"Super fun place to go and hang out with a group of people even if you're not a golfer you'll still have a great time it's a little pricey but that's Vegas for you and it's definitely better to have a group of people"}
{"text":"I went today as a solo in 107 degrees.  Mandatory valet parking was well timed.  Parking only cost me the tip upon pick up.   Within 5 minutes, I was hitting my first ball.

Never been?  Think bowling and target practice you are half way there.  My server (Michelle) was great and the sliders I had for lunch were very good!   I played for an hour and that was plenty.  If I had played with a group, it might take longer.

Levels 1&2 are family oriented, level 3 is adult only and includes a bar and a pool.  Level 4 is more for parties and VIP needs.  

Fun place, moderately priced by Vegas standards, a good way to socialize with a fun activity.  I will definitely go again with a group to maximize the value!"}
{"text":"Slow service once we arrived and got to our table,  thought it was going to be a experience.  
Our server, Kenny, was ok, but wasn't able to meet our specific dietary needs.  I was frustrated! 
Brian,  the manager,  came to the rescue,  and made our experience right!  He really took care of us and turned our experience around."}
{"text":"Ingenious idea! Never played golf before.. at all, this was so fun. My boys loves it, fun for all ages.  You can make the game very competitive or very relaxed,  its up to you. Great food, service was ok. Still 5 stars, because we went for the game.. and the game was great!"}
{"text":"Second time here and I love this place! The manager Tim was so helpful getting everything arranged, and all the staff was exceptional! So nice and attentive. The food her is so yummy. I like the portabella sandwhich with tater tots. The doughnut holes dessert is the bomb!! I  look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"It's fine but not if you are going to work on your game. This is purely a \"have a few beers and laugh with your buddies place\". Cool place to check out once but I wouldn't sign up for a long term membership."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to go to and it's kid friendly too! We were greeted by a nice gentleman that walked us to our area and he was very friendly and gave us information on how to use the golf screen. Then a few minutes later we were greeted by Lauren to ask us what kind of drinks or any food we would like to order. She continued to check on us frequently and made the experience that much better. We ordered a pizza flatbread, chips with salsa and guacamole, and French fries with ranch. We all also ordered drinks that were brought out to us very quickly and we never had to look for anyone to order the next. All the appetizers we ordered were delicious and came out quickly as well. 

We did one hour of golf and it was a fun experience with some great views. Also living in Arizona it can get very hot, but they do everything they can do to make you forget how hot it actually is by keeping us cool with misters and fans. I will be back and next time I will be bringing my son."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Topgolf twice in a few days with out of town guests. This place is pricey, but hey, awesome things sometimes are. I don't know that I will ever be able to go back to a regular range again. To start, the view is tough to beat, with the Superstitions in the background. The service from the front counter to the wait staff was very friendly. The first time I went was late afternoon ($45/hr) for the bay. The second was Sunday AM ($25/hr) for the bay- great deal! The cost would really not be too bad if you had 4-6 people splitting it over a few hours. We played the regular game, \"Topgolf.\" It was easy to learn the procedures to play, and I felt we hit a ton of balls over the course of the hour. My son (7) was there for one of the times, and he had a blast. What I really like is how no matter your skill level, age, etc...you can find Topgolf fun and challenging. My only complaint would be that once in awhile the shot did not seem to score accurately. If you were being competitive about it, not that you have to, this would obviously be a problem. We did not eat, but had a few reasonably priced, local brews. Great recommendation on the Otra Vez with salt and lime! Topgolf is appropriate for so many occasions- family time, corporate outing, adult fun, and my son wants his next bday party here (SWEET!). So cool to have this place 5 minutes from home. I will be back...often!"}
{"text":"Whether it is for Brunch, Lunch or Dinner this place has been consistent!  I have enjoyed visiting Topgolf every time I have gone.  The place has just recently opened but it seems their kinks are getting worked out better and better with each visit.  I would suggest 6 people per bay because of space and time to play.  Food and drinks are awesome and well prepared!  

Word to the wise if your planning on visiting for your first time.. Go online to topgolf.com and register for a membership.  It costs $5 which is the same for in store purchase however, it will SAVE you A LOT of time.  If you register online you can walk in and they will print the membership card right away.  Just be sure to have you RE # from the confirmation email! 

This is a great place to visit for all ages.  I just recently was there with my twin brother and sister ages 4 and my 83 year old grandmother.  Everyone hit balls and had a great time!  Weekends are certainly the busiest so plan ahead.  Even in this 100 degree weather they have all the bays chilled with fans and misters."}
{"text":"This place was fun! There was a 1-2 hour wait for a booth to play, so my group of friends and I decided to hang out at the bar and grab a bite to eat while we wait. Then we discovered a Hacky sack toss game and took turns playing until a booth was ready. I was a newbie, but ended up hitting a few in. Definitely enjoyed the ambiance, music, and bright lights! I would come back again with more friends to play drunk golf!"}
{"text":"I enjoy going the Scottsdale location for topgolf. I would recommend coming here during the day time
rather than night time because it can get very busy! Their service is quick and attentive to their customers. The food is decent, I've only tried a few items on their menu like their turkey wrap, chicken wings, donut holes, pizza, fries, and chicken burger. The background view is pretty cool at night."}
{"text":"So. Much. Fun! Top Golf is an amazing venue for a group to get together and have a good time. We came here last night and truly enjoyed it. Our server Janet was awesome! We had a whole spread which was cool. We started out with the Yellowtail Sashimi, and a few sushi rolls. All were absolutely phenomenal. Then they brought out the mother of all bbq platters... It was so freaking good! I had the pulled pork and sausages. I dont know what they put in their sausages to make them so good but they were the best. 
Between the great service, view, and food we will definitely be back. 

PS you dont have the be the best golfer in the world to have fun, this was the first time I ever hit a goldf ball and still had fun :)"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!  This was perfect for our family reunion.   We all came together for a funeral but spent the remainder of the day with the wonderful supportive staff of Topgolf Gilbert.   Thank you we will always have wonderful memories of today."}
{"text":"This place is the absolute best. Seriously! My office had some difficulty with booking our large party (22 people with 3 bays) but once I called Mike Lichwa - he made everything perfect. He answered all of my questions and handled everything for us. We arrived and checked in after a very small wait giving us a chance to check out the other areas. He gave us a quick demo on how to use the golf machines and some pointers on how to maximize our fun. This is one of the best corporate events we've ever had. Everyone had an absolute blast. I can't wait to come back. Our server was ok, but honestly no one really noticed because we were all having so much fun. She wasn't overly motivated as I felt like I had to track her down to order drinks. I don't know maybe she was just letting us enjoy the golf. Either way it was so much fun. It's harder than it looks but also easy enough that pretty much anyone can enjoy themselves. My boss is 75 years old and he had a blast. Usually when we do these team building corporate events - he prefers to sit out and watch everyone else. I was so happy to see him enjoying himself and being competitive against the rest of us. Money well spent! 

*My office did have some issues with trying to book the event for us but I wasn't involved in that at all so I won't let it alter my review. Once I was involved and dealing with Mike Lichwa everything was incredibly easy. I highly recommend calling him for any reservations."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a Thursday and Friday morning. Friday seemed to be a little busier had to wait 10 min for a slot to open. I'm no golfer but it was such a great experience here. It's something highly recommended if you are in Vegas. Prices can get a little high if staying over an hour and eating and drinking here. Their  margarita pizza was delicious and super fresh. They didn't have to many times on the menu, considering it is a place to golf."}
{"text":"Fun way to get out of the sun for a few hours.  Great spot to bring the family or hang with friends.  Drinks, food and golf. Lots of TV's.

All around a fun time!"}
{"text":"Amazing place to spend an evening or celebrate a birthday! Service is great! This place is a must go!"}
{"text":"I have had my corporate company party here for the last two holidays. First year was about 22 accommodations and this year we had 40 accommodations with Buffett. It was very reasonable in pricing for each person. We had our own 9  bays and tons of food for everyone. We always have raffles and prizes to give away and top golf employees always met my needs. I recommend taking your friends for a night out or throw a party and have the top golf team do all the work."}
{"text":"I was a bit concerned looking at other reviews about this location on the reservations, wait time, customer service... but I was happily surprised when I called to make a reservation for 6 at 8 on a Monday night and all three people I spoke with were very helpful and friendly. We were able to reserve our bitty for 270 minimum food and beverage, not including the 75 per hour of golf. The experience there was pretty good and the 2 hours flew by fast! Food was reasonably priced for the kind of food it was, and the service was pretty good considering it was busy."}
{"text":"Always a fun event. Cool atmosphere & fun place to hang out when friends come to town. Arnold was our bartender the last couple times & I will always look for him from here on out. The place is a packed madhouse & he's a blast & super fast at making awesome drinks."}
{"text":"Top Golf is a blast. We had fun. Our kids had a great time. What else can you ask for? Well, not much really. One little thing though that's offputting is how they include the price of the game with any items your server brings out such as food and drinks as one bill, that percentage-wise, makes it seem that you need to tip more at the end. I mean, if it costs $35 to hit balls for an hour, and you order one $5 beer, you now owe more for the tip on that beer than the beer itself.  It seems like trickery to get the servers bigger tips. Not a fan of that method. Is that a little thing? I don't know, but I think I'll continue tipping on the service instead of the price to play regardless of how the bill is compiled."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Can't wait for them to open one in Washington state. The servers were very attentive and quick with everyone of our orders. We went there two days in a row, top floor and second floor definitely had great view. New favorite spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is super fun. We came here with a big group and Bobby was so cool and took care of us"}
{"text":"Beautiful facility alot of fun. Nice ambient place to hit your balls and get them washed...."}
{"text":"I went here for a work function and will definitely be back. Warning to the serious golfers out there, this place may not be for you :). It's a fun atmosphere whether you're going on a date or family adventure. The food is great. The only downside is parking can be difficult given how busy they are even on workdays!"}
{"text":"This place was so fun for our family of 6. Everyone had a fabulous time playing the golf games and corn hole. We decided to eat and play. The steak nachos...excellent...and the wings...so good. No wonder this is a destination!  We loved this and the kids are asking to go back before we leave town.  Only two negatives, long wait with no reservations allowed  and, oh, steer clear of the signature drinks, yuck!"}
{"text":"This is my most favorite place to bring my friends and family!! The food, the staff, the atmosphere and drinks are AMAZING!! It's just overall the best time we've ever had."}
{"text":"As a local I'm highly disappointed in this place. Beautiful concept BUT the service is horrible, food isn't good, and not enough experienced people. This is my first and last time"}
{"text":"This place sucks. Food took forever and it was wrong twice, the heaters are broken in the\"on\" position, in gd Arizona!! Service for drinks took about 25 minutes for each drink. First time coming will, not come back."}
{"text":"I have been to top golf many times and it seems the quality of customer service is getting worse every time I visit. Today I went with 2 other couples which made a total of 6 of us. We order a round of drinks and when our waiter Hunter came back informed us that they actually discontinued one of the drinks that was order. Ok, we ordered a different drink again 5 min later we were told they were out of it. Fine! We asked for a recommendation for moscato he told us there was another wine that was similar but when we tried it, it was sour! Finally we ordered the Rum Punch golf bag, and he asked to see 2 IDs? At this point everyone has been drinking and well ok fine here are 2 IDs that you have already seen... then we ordered chicken quesadillas waited 5 min and nachos came out. 10 more minutes go by Hunter is no where to be found I finally asked a different server for the quesadilla and we were told Hunter ordered the wrong thing and we had to wait for them now... 15 min later we get them. Hunter never came around to check on us and never apologized... Once we got what we ordered he came back and asked if we needed anything if not if we could close out.............. horrible horrible service. After that we were still playing another server came over and shut down our game with 3 min left... needless to say for the money you pay to eat, drink, and play. Your money can be well spent somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great place to play, dine, and watch a concert. Had the pleasure to see Scotty McCreery, he put on an awesome concert. 
While there enjoyed some golf, they have plenty of bays. Had no waiting time.
Also, they make a Mac and Cheese that ranks up there with the best. Also had chicken kabobs, which were tender and juicy. The icing in the cake were their donut holes. These cake donut holes come are perfect by themselves, however if you need some additional sweetness, they are served with vanilla or chocolate cream you can inject into the donut. Either way they are WOW."}
{"text":"I enjoyed MY time. I can't say the same for everyone else. But this was the first time the family has visited Top Golf. What mattered was the kids had a wonderful time as it was their first experience hitting golf balls other than just the backyard. This propelled my daughter to want her own set of clubs and go to the regular driving range as well. 
Anyways, our host was great. She brought more water and juice when our glasses were needed of refills. We just had drinks and the nachos which was satisfying, considering I'm not a nachos type of person. But everyone else liked it as well. 
Everyone receives their own card to use in the future. Has your record of games played and I'm guessing how you fare in the games. Gee thanks. But there are many games to play and varieties of scoring. Each booth has both women and men's clubs, as well as children size if needed. 
Although we visited in the morning, we'll try to come at night when the targets are lit. But for the most part, we had a great time. Think of when you go bowling, and you're in your own section, having fun, drinking, eating, etc. But golf on Red Bull. Can't wait to go back.
Thank you."}
{"text":"I married into a golf family, so when we visited Vegas, this was a must for a night out. 

I'm Scottish, but I'd never swung a golf club. That didn't really matter here. It's kind of like bowling for golf enthusiasts.

It was a relatively quiet Monday night, several other groups around but it kind of felt like we had the place to ourselves. The booth was comfortably big enough for the 7 of us, the servers were friendly and efficient, and we got stuck in right away. It was getting quite chilly but the climate controls worked a treat. 

I have no basis for comparison here, but everything was in good nick, there were full sets of clubs which were all in great condition, and the computer controls were a bit finnicky but manageable. You take 5 turns at a time and I think around 30 strokes total. There are goals to hit, like aiming for the various markers, but for beginners it's really just about hitting the ball and seeing how far you can make it. The drinks were flowing and we got a few snacks, too, making it an enjoyable couple of hours.

I think we paid around $200 for the time. With drinks and tips it rounded off to around $500 - for a couple hours entertainment for 7 people, including drinks and snacks, it's not cheap but not too bad for Vegas. I'd come back."}
{"text":"I've been to the location Vegas, and this one was not a great deal different. It's a pretty fun experience and a good way to spend a few hours with a group of friends - as long as you don't mind spending osme coin.

We checked in and were told there'd be a 40 minute wait, so grabbed a drink in the meantime. The bar staff were efficient, though some beers were under-poured. There's a nice seating area upstairs by the bar and they had heaters running. We were called up really quickly then had to wait 10 minutes for a bay, which was odd, but fine. Then we were assigned one that was already in use, so quite a bit of carry-on and confusion before we got to our bay and were settled.

Since we'd been before we were able to remember and re-use the memberships we'd set up last time. There's a charge of $5 to sign up and an expectation for every member of the party to have their own membership - which I have to say cheapens the experience for me. I resent knowing I'll have to unsubscribe from their marketing every time I go here. It's also a pain to have to try to remember some username and password you set up months before (and likely while tipsy) - so that's pretty irritating.

Once in the booth, the servers were adept at handling large drunk groups, which I applaud. The game itself is fun enough, though we couldn't figure out an easy way to make it accessible to our various skill levels."}
{"text":"Game was fun - service needs major improvements. I get they are new but it's as if no one there knows what's going on. While waiting for our bay, we went to the third level bar and ordered drinks. First off there were only 2 bartenders for a very crowded bar area. Took 20 minutes to get poorly made drinks and we watched as food sat on the bar for 15 minutes as no one knew which table it went to. Once at our bay, it was apparent the communication in this place between employees was horrible. We were told they were out of straws and limes, we personally walked to another floor and found both these items on the other floor from the bar.... come on. Then our food came our wrong and at different increments. I was completely done with my food by the time my side of fries even came to the table which I had to remind our server about 3 times. Not once did a manager stop over to check in, nor did the server try to get anything done to make up for the errors and slow delivery times. I work in the hospitality industry and this is just unacceptable. I know things like this happen but it's all about how you recover by going above and beyond to make the situation better, and a simple I'm sorry goes a long way too. Tip to management, train your staff better and be more present in the evening. We will be back hoping the kinks get worked out."}
{"text":"Really had a great time and loved the place
Pro Tip- If your local you get 20% off, also its cheaper between 9-12 and 12-3 or so during the day.

Took my 20 yr old son who was in town for visiting. This is really good and economical Vegas non gambling entertainment during the day. I could see that this place gets pretty cray and expensive at night for the Cali and tourist crowd.

The video boards are amazing and the food was good too. Its a driving range on steriods."}
{"text":"No better place to come if you're in the mood for any or all of the following: golf, good food, a sporting event, drinks, fun up-beat staff, great view, and more!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool, especially if you're bored and have nothing else to do.  Unfortunately it can be a pretty long wait especially if you go at night.

We put our name on the list and we're told we would get a text when they had a place for us.  After waiting well beyond the time given my boyfriend went to see how much longer it would take, and come to find out my name was no longer there!  They couldn't find me in the system.  They quickly accommodated us and sent us off along with our server.

It was only two of us and an hour went by so quickly that I can't imagine a large group getting much play time in one hour and it can get pretty expensive after that.  

We order the tacos, pizza and beer and all was pretty good."}
{"text":"Non-golfer's review of a golfing place, so take it with a grain of salt...

My company held a corporate event here, taking over most if not all of the driving ranges for an evening. The different \"lanes\" on the driving range all had high-top tables or sofas and coffee tables (a better choice for me to sit and chat with others, as I don't golf much, so thanks for putting comfortable furniture out there!), patio heaters and drink service. The golfers in our group really enjoyed it. Our group also had buffet food service, which they don't have a lot of room to set up near the driving ranges, but it mostly worked. My only gripe is our group drink tickets didn't include the wine I wanted and even if I offered to trade all three drink tickets for one glass of what I wanted, they wouldn't do it though that would've worked out financially to their advantage."}
{"text":"Super fun place. First time here while in Vegas. 30 minute wait went by quickly while we watched the Clippers game and played corn hole. We spent $169 for an hour and half golf plus lunch for 4. We had a total blast! Our golf host and table server Imani were both very friendly and really made our afternoon something special. My son was treated to  amazing donut holes for his birthday!  

Thank you. We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun and so....... Vegas. If you are intrigued by the way bowling alleys have gone upscale to more of a nightclub feel, welcome to TopGolf. If you show up with your own bowling ball and shoes, then this is not for you.

Maybe 30 hitting stations wide by 4 stories tall. Only 200 yards to the net on the other side, but who cares? This is so fun and so upscale and, when you are entertaining a big group, is not that expensive. Yes, its Vegas, so expect some very expensive options. The pictures on yelp don't lie. Super fun time and my group was ecstatic with our fun evening."}
{"text":"Not for golfers, more for novelty fun. If your not at all concerned about identify theft this is the place for you as to comply with their \"registration\" you must give them your drivers license so they can scan it, your e-mail address and cell phone number.  To begin with they have more rules about what you can/can't bring than the TSA does about getting on a plane. No woods/drivers because they didn't design the course correctly. You can't bring your own irons in, if you do you are limited to the bottom level (I thought this was top golf, not bottom golf?). We found this out simply trying to bring my 9 iron in and my Son's youth 7 iron. What is my iron going to do that their crappy clubs won't? If your a golfer how do you get better using anothers crappy club?

Upon entering I asked how long the wait was and the guy at the door said 45 minutes. Then after waiting a few minutes to get through line and pay for the mandatory membership per person I inquired again about the wait and she said she didn't know you would have to ask concierge which was another area/desk. When I got to concierge to \"check in\" the wait was now 1 1/2 hours. Wow, now that they had my money the truth about the wait comes out and it's doubled. Well by now we are going to stick this one out. So we went to the bar area to order a late lunch. Wait staff was very disorganized as we had to wait nearly 15 minutes before we could flag somebody down and get their attention for which they replied \"Oh, do you want to order something?\". Nah, we just figured we'd all sit at this table and stare at menu's for the next 90 minutes.

We finally got assigned a station and began having some fun, but the machine that dispenses balls broke down 3 separate times. 

Great concept, poor execution and to me an invasion of privacy to comply with their registration process."}
{"text":"A great place to take family, friends or business clients. It's also a great date night idea, too! I've come here probably 10 times over the last few years. It's always a great experience. Food is decent. Drinks are good. It's just flat-out fun!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Topgolf but I had a good idea of what to expect.  Lots of people drinking, golfing and just having a good ol time.  It's a beautiful complex and very modern.  We went on a Saturday night so it was pretty crowded.  We only had to wait 30 minutes for our own golfing bay which wasn't bad.  We grabbed a drink in the super cool modern bar and before we knew it, it was our turn to golf.  

The golfing is fun - it's basically just a driving range turned into a competition much like darts or bowling.  Great place for groups or parties! 

The food was actually above average for a bar!  I was impressed with the sliders and quesadilla.

The drinks were great!  Go for the frozen margs with a sangria float :) 

Next time I go back it's going to be for sunday funday because they have awesome deals on Sundays and why not?"}
{"text":"Topgolf is definitely a good place to go if you want to have a fun and relaxing night with your family or friends. This place offers a multitude of different things. If you wanted to, you could play golf, go shopping in \"gift shop\" area, eat good food, and watch tv all at the same time. Topgolf was a great concept to make but it does have its flaws. The biggest issue I had with this place was the long wait times you have before you can rent out a Bay Area. We went on a calm Wednesday night and the wait time for us in a group of 4 was 1 1/2 hours. Seems a little long for me considering they were not that busy and it was the middle of the week. My other issue was how expensive this place was. Depending on what time of day you go, you can expect to pay anywhere from $25, $35, or $45 per hour on Sun-Thurs or $50 per hour on Fri and Sat. This was all just to rent out an area and nothing else. To me, it's really not a place you can go all the time but I do find that it s good place to visit for a good time every now and again. On a side note, the staff was one of the things that made the experience that much better. They were all very helpful, attentive, and kind no matter what we asked them. They were truly amazing people."}
{"text":"Really late review, but I'm on a spree so... we had a work function there a while back and we had a great time, their food and drinks were great and the staff was very attentive. We had blast drunkenly hitting balls out. Honestly we didn't even keep score or care where the balls went lol, we just enjoyed the atmosphere they provided."}
{"text":"I've gone several times with friends and we've never had a bad time... and none of us even particularly enjoy golfing! In fact, I feel like part of the fun is watching people make fools of themselves trying to do something that seems so simple. Fortunately, the holes are quite large and there's close ones (close enough you can just throw the ball into if you're so inclined); so there's a decent chance of getting a points in spite of yourself. Getting another ball is fast and easy so it's easy to just keep trying until you have success (unless you're trying to actually play the game correctly that is).

Service has never been a problem - the server kept our waters full even though we almost never buy food. The few times we did get food, it was acceptable - nothing amazing, but I don't think anybody goes there just for the food. Everyone's nice and seem genuinely interested in making sure you have a good time. 

TopGolf can definitely be expensive, so it's best to have at least a few people (although that would be true even disregarding the cost). Also - go before 5 if possible to avoid the rate increase!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area visiting.  Especially if you like to hit the range.

Ate at the restaurant - service was good and the burgers were quite good.

Don't order the chips/guac.  That was disappointing."}
{"text":"Great place to be. Anderson and CB took great care of us. Superb service, always came around to check on us, kept us comfortable the whole time. Definitely returning and bringing everyone I know. Haven't been to a driving range like this ever. Simply breathtaking. Fun fun fun. Good job team. Anderson and CB make is worth returning."}
{"text":"If you come here definitely get here early bc you wait possibly up to 2 hours for your bay to get ready. However, while you wait you can get food
And drinks which is a plus. The only downside i had was that it took forever for a waitress to acknowledge us. We had to physically go search for a person after asking waitresses that were waiting in tables near us . That made the experience less than enjoyable."}
{"text":"Fun place with amazing staff! Very clean. Very friendly. Super clean bathrooms. Very good food. Love all the free games as well like pool, football and Kinect."}
{"text":"What a great idea!!  I don't golf but I had so much fun playing with two good golfers. This is a team sport. Gather all your friend and go do this you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"As a local, I've visited Topgolf a couple of times since it's opening here in Las Vegas, and it's a lot of fun! 

Topgolf is a multi-level driving range that offers bay rentals by the hour. The cheapest is $30/hr on the first level, and the price increases the higher you want to be situated. While the top floor obviously offers the best views, Topgolf was designed so that every level offers wonderful views of Las Vegas. 

If you've never visited Topgolf before, it's very beginner friendly; imagine a driving range with dart boards scattered everywhere, and the object of most of the games is to hit the ball into these \"dart boards\" or \"holes,\" each assigned with different point values. Each bay can comfortably seat 4-5 people, the seating arrangement containing an L shaped couch as well as a table. 

The best way to do Topgolf is with friends; you can get 4-5 friends and easily split the cost of renting a bay for a few hours of fun. I'd also recommend going at night. While Topgolf faces north, away from the sun, it's still extremely hot during the summer, and the temperature is just perfect in the later hours of the day. My final recommendation is to go during off-peak days to avoid massive crowds (Tuesday, Wednesday).

Chow down on the food if you'd like, but since you're right behind The Strip, you're going to be paying tourist trap prices. The attendants also can be a bit aggressive in wanting your party to purchase food or drinks, so be mindful. 

Overall, Topgolf is an awesome place to spend some quality time with friends, or to bring someone on a date!"}
{"text":"Just got done golfing here for my birthday weekend, and being my first time there, it was pretty fun to have to bays side to side and hanging out with my friends and family at the same time. Our server was pretty good for the most part, but she did take a while for a few of the drinks and forgot one, but other than that she was pretty accommodating and helpful. Since we did go during the day and was on the first floor I would definitely like to go back during the night time and on the top floor to see if there's a bit of a fun difference, so that being said definitely going back for sure, and maybe even go to the Scottsdale one and check that one out. Even though I was absolutely terrible at this!

P.s. the bottom floor has a cool little lounge room, with Kinect, 2 big screen TVs, 2 pool tables, and a shuffleboard table along with couches and a few high tops, so that was fun after golfing!"}
{"text":"All of a sudden, you see it. A blue lit mecca amidst a desert backdrop, it beckons and calls towards you. Excited, yet unsure, you walk up the steps and in to the building,  and the site you behold is one of shock and awe. A combo of modern technology,  convenience, and man's instinctive nature to put things in holes has led to this shrine for indulgent entertainment at its finest. I have seen it all, I've seen topgolf.

Back to the review: a great place to hang out and mingle with friends. Much like bowling, there's is fun to be had here, regardless of skill. With its combination of food, drinks, and fun this place had something for everyone, regardless if you want to hit some balls or not. The technology and idea to create a driving range where it can be more than hitting balls on to a green is quite novel and sorely needed in southern California. The price can be a little high to come all the time, but it'd be a perfect place for companies to host events or for other \"business meetings\". If it were a bit cheaper,  I'd come back to Arizona just for this"}
{"text":"Fun place, you don't even have to be good at golf. The service is quick, the food is great and the golf is challenging. Wait times are long unless you go in the morning, but all in all a great time."}
{"text":"Highly recommend for big groups and team builders! The food is ok. Mostly bar food. I didn't drink so I'm not sure what the beer selection looks like. I mostly enjoyed the golfing and watching where my ball landed. The balls have chips in them and your scored according to where your ball lands!!! So you can compete or just play for fun."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing and fun for golf lovers or people that don't know a thing about it! We were staying at Caesar's Palace so we decided to taxi over to Topgolf. The driver had no clue what Topgolf was which is pretty surprising since it's the hottest thing in Vegas right now so she dropped us at the MGM Grand. Not ideal, but there is a shuttle or plenty of signs in the hotel to guide you to TopGolf.

We arrived on a Friday at 11:30 AM and were immediately taken to the bay of our choice (we chose to play on the highest level which is 3 but this costs extra). I was so surprisd there was no wait from all the horror stories I read on here. They set up your Topgolf membership and give you a tour of the bay before leaving you to it. The bay is sooo nice with everything you could want: charging stations, plush seating, your own set of mens/womens clubs, drinks/food that can be ordered from the waitress assigned to your bay, and heaters! My husband and I played for two hours and tried a couple of the games. We also ordered the pulled pork sliders, the rock shrimp, s'more cookie things and 4 drinks. The pulled pork sliders were good but I wasn't a fan of the rock shrimp (wanted the sauce to be stronger) or s'more cookies (cookies were not soft enough). We would definitely come back here in a heartbeat even though it's pretty pricey. We just wish there was one by us but then you would not get those fabulous Vegas views as you practice!"}
{"text":"The Top Golf experience itself is great. This would've been 5 stars if it was just left at that. But the staff/service is pretty... Meh. I'll start with the good.

Good! The actual premise is awesome, and a lot of fun. Enough space for you and your friends to not be bumping shoulders with other groups. The Golf process itself is entertaining. Free WiFi. The food is fantastic. Live music.

Meh. We had an expense-paid trip from my company, so I probably would have been more pissed if it were my dollar being spent. We paid for the more expensive 3rd floor area, and were  told that it supported up to 6 people hitting balls at the same time, as we didn't want to do the whole bowling thing where we all waited while one person went. The staff put us on the second floor anyway, and somehow were convinced that it was the 3rd floor, even after we asked (and, yanno, the giant staircase leading up). Given that, it only gave us enough time (2 hours slot) to go through one game.

While the food itself was great, the actual process of getting it was not so much. Our waitress bungled our order not once, but twice. First was simply a burger mistake, someone wanted medium well, it was medium rare (and marked as such). Honestly, I usually overlook this, but it got sent back. Second, we had an order of Sashimi. They returned with a $75 plate of tacos. Nobody really questioned it, as again, it was the company's dollar and we were certain someone ordered it. After asking around, we realized nobody had. When asked, the waitress said we never ordered sashimi in the first place. Huh? By that time we didn't want to waste precious time, so we just went with it (The tacos were great, really. But not the point). It's entirely possible that this could be due to the (While lovely) live music, which is REALLY loud. Like, my throat hurt at the end of the night because all talking must be done at the top of your lungs, including ordering.

We also weren't notified that you shouldn't enter players names while someone is playing, or their swings will go onto whoever is editing. It screwed up the first 2-3 balls of our game because one person put their info in and started hitting while the rest of us put our info in.

I highly recommend it, and I'll go again. Just be forewarned that it will be expensive, and possibly frustrating. When something is 'pay by hour', getting orders wrong and having system issues is literally cutting into your wallet and fun."}
{"text":"Golf, beer, and good friends! With those 3 present, you really can't go wrong. I've been to the one in VA and FL but the one here in Vegas adds a pool and cabana area. The pool and cabana is a nice touch but if you're seated next to a rambunctious group it may put you off. The third floor is limited to 21 y/o and older which is where we were last time. Food is pretty good and goes well with the beer and golf. I like the 7 layer dip and wings to share; then let the everyone choose one dish for variety. The games you can play make it fun and competitive. My main complaint this visit is that it took 30 minutes for the staff to get two members of our group left handed clubs. But definitely fun was had by all!!"}
{"text":"I love going here!  My only criticism is that the staff and service really seems to vary. One time they cut my table off for no reason and all the other times they have been great. Also it's pretty expensive so I don't think I'll go back that often but I had a lot of fun."}
{"text":"If I could give TopGolf 10 stars, I would do it! I took my boyfriend here while visiting the Phoenix area, and as an avid golfer, he absolutely loved it. We stayed for three hours and got to see the sunset, a beautiful moon rise, and had the background of a nice hotel that coordinated its lights with the facility. We enjoyed the pretzel bites as an appetizer, pepperoni pizza and chicken sandwich for dinner, and a Moscow Mule and Orange Dream for our drinks. Our server, Alex, was on top of it and made sure everything worked out. This is a great place to hang out with friends, take the family, or host a birthday party. I wish there was a TopGolf in the Los Angeles area because I would be a regular member!!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check out TopGolf since it opened and finally had a chance to go. I went with a group on a Monday night, since weekends can get pretty busy. We got our membership cards and were directed to our bay. Food and drinks were all delicious, we had the fish bowl (says to share with 4 people) and I tried the chicken and waffle sliders. Even though I didn't hit the ball farther than the green section, I still had a blast! It was a very expensive night though so not a place we can go often unfortunately! Definitely check this place out whether you are a pro or a beginner!"}
{"text":"Super crowded!!!! The concept of top golf is really cool. It kinda reminds me of bowling but has way way more people there. There's people everywhere waiting to play this driving range game. I went for the first time on a Saturday evening. I don't suggest that time especially if it's your first time and your excited to check it out."}
{"text":"Always a fun time at Topgolf good affordable night out with a group of friends. Signature drinks are always good. My issue from keeping this a 5 Star review is the food, it's just mediocre. I would personally like to see the menus fresher seems like a lot of fried/ frozen items/"}
{"text":"Great fun, food and service. The concept is awesome and perfect for so many types of events. Highly recommend for casual food and fun."}
{"text":"Was not allowed to take my own clubs in with me nor the coffee I had just bought.  Therfore we left went up the street a few miles and got to use my own clubs and ha e my coffee.  Doubt I will return to Top Golf."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for some cold, soggy eggs benedict with bland potatoes. I'm normally pleased with the service at Topgolf but today was horrible. The manager came to let us know our food would be out \"shortly.\"  after a hour and a half passed. Still paid full price for everything."}
{"text":"We tried to book a corporate event and the event booking team was not flexible with providing a flexible booking window. It is unfortunate when we were bringing 12-14 people that would have spent a significant amount of money. We had to come up with an alternative location last minute. 
Topgolf did not offer any other solutions or any flexible options. 
Don't bring your large groups here"}
{"text":"I suck at golf, but this was definitely a fun time. It looks like a driving range but it's so much more. There are several holes/targets for various games that make this fun even for those that don't play golf. Plus, the food and drinks are pretty good. Chicken wings come glazed in your choice of mango habanero, Asian sesame, buffalo, or BBQ sauce. Rock shrimp was a touch sweet, but meaty with a crispy exterior. The roasted garlic flatbread had some good flavors with the combo of spinach,garlic, and ricotta all on a thin, crispy crust. The tuna tartare was good, too, but those accompanying chips were spicy. 

There are 4 levels of golfing bays, plus plenty of bars, TVs, lounges, and even a pool, making this a great spot to hang out for families, bachelor/bachelorette parties, or anything in between."}
{"text":"Impromptu visit with guests before they left for the airport.  We met up around 6pm on Weds evening.  The parking lot was almost a ghost town.  There seemed to be more employees than guest initially, but by the time we left, it was pretty busy.  The hourly game selection at different rates for blocks of times during the day, initially seemed a bit overwhelming so I sat back and let my friends decide.  Our party of 5 fit nicely in the bay.  We ordered, Rockin Shrimp, a burger, pulled pork sliders and a pizza that were all very yummy.  I was starving, so I forgot to snap pics of the food.... next time!  I too will visit the adult only floors as I later found that I missed out on the pools, etc.
The teens in the group enjoyed there rounds of hitting the balls.  We will certainly return and next time after dark to enjoy the night lights! - Our hostess and helper were friendly and decently attentive, except when our time was up.... they wanted us OUT!  ;-/  - I'll know better of what to expect next time!!!  1 hour of play $60 for 3 peeps.  Previously listed food and 3 sodas - $80.
My friend paid for the play and I paid for the food.  Now that I think about it, I only tipped on the food... I hope that I didn't gip the girl!?!"}
{"text":"Last time I was there I paid over 900 dollars for two bay for a group event and the place was fun but the valet was one and a half hours to get my car from valet. And we had to order our drinks multiple times for them to bring them. I tried to book another event today and my information was taken and I was told someone would call me back. After five hours I have yet to receive a call back. I call to find out what's going on and I get sent to voicemail multiple times. I know this place is new but a little organization would go a long way. If you can put up with a lack of prompt service and calling multiple times to get a bay this place is great.

Update. 6/10 4pm

Received a call from the sales manager and was very accommodating. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"We went around 12:30am last night to avoid the lines and we walked right on. Problem was at the end of the night, the service gets real snippety; its obvious they just want you to gtfo. 

Mostly perpetuated from one guy who should not be working the close shift, hopefully you don't have to deal with him.

Overall fun place, just don't expect great service even though you're paying TopDollar."}
{"text":"Took my nephew here tonight and it was a Blast! Great service from our waiter in the restaurant and the front staff. No waiting to get a lane on the top floor on a Friday Night. (Way cool) Top Golf is a fun place for the whole family and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Came out for lunch and a day of golf. We ordered lunch and waited 45 minutes for lunch and when it arrived we still hadn't received one of our appetizers. When lunch finally arrived the fries were cold. I mean cold...not even room temp. One of guest of 6's burger was stone cold that he couldn't eat it. Another guests sea bass sliders were again stone cold. I won't blame the waitress, I blame the kitchen staff. Somebody needs to be raked over the coals for this. We are walking away without golfing or drinking anymore. 6 guests all disappointed.

UPDATE

Ok so the manager came to our table and apologized and explained why our food was cold. They comp'd us some food so we decided to stay for golf. We were greeted and brought to our bay. We were told if we wanted to use a 7 iron we had to reach across to use the one on the next bay. We did and a young lady (no sorry, a young girl) was very nasty to my family and berated us for doing exactly what you hostess told us to do. If she worked for me, I would have fired her on the spot. This was a disaster."}
{"text":"Topgolf is awesome! More so their Event Sales Manager, Lauren Cope, is amazing! Her customer service and follow up in helping us plan our event was incredible. Having a young son there were many times I had to get off the phone unexpectedly and her patience and flexibility was much appreciated! She deserves much praise!"}
{"text":"Front desk staff went above and beyond to answer questions and meet our needs. After a minor issue with payment, our attendant was very understanding, helped us and was courteous with timing. We had 2 bays, due to card issue 1 was taking longer to reserve, so it was almost taken. When we informed the attendant who was trying to give it away, she was rude to the our attendant and was being condescending which none of us thought was ok to do in front of customers. There were 18 of us who witnessed this. Which is why I am giving a good rating, we had great/excellent at service until we witnessed this.
Food was GREAT, we had queso, chips were a little stale tasting, but not bad. I heard from friend the quesadillas were amazing, pretzels were good minus the cheese. I also heard the burger was amazing too. 
Music could have been better, at random moments it would come blaring through, so more consistent or variety of music would be great!"}
{"text":"I heard from a few people that this place was awesome, so when my boyfriend and I came to Vegas last week for vacation I decided to check it out. I looked on the website, which was confusing as far as how to book, the cost, what is included etc. Since I couldn't figure it out from the website,  I called multiple times Thursday - Sunday to ask some questions and make an appointment if possible, and no one ever answered the phone. I left three separate voicemails over the course of the weekend, and it has now been almost been a week and I still have yet to hear anything back. I ended up not being able to ever get through, so I gave up and we didn't go. What kind of business doesn't respond to voicemails? It looks like this place is pretty big, and they charge quite a bit to play golf. You would think that they could afford to pay more than one employee."}
{"text":"I went here for a team outing and had much more fun then I expected. 

The service was great and the golf pro was very patient and helpful. While I won't be playing in the Masters anytime soon I improved with each game. 

Even though the bays are in the shade, wear sunscreen because depending on the time of day you may have sun exposure and end up with some rosy cheeks 

Wear comfortable clothes that you can move in as you will be golfing!"}
{"text":"We finally got to try Topgolf on a recent visit to Vegas. I'm happy to say it did not disappoint. The environment was really cool, great views, the food was surprisingly good and the prices were fairly reasonable. We waited about an hour for a bay on the 2nd floor which ran us $75 per hour for as many golfers as we wanted (we had 4). There was plenty to do while waiting for our bay and although service was slow while we were waiting it was really good once we got into our bay. Overall a really good family friendly experience."}
{"text":"In town for Keller Williams Family Reunion and decided to try something different for our team dinner. Top Golf was great. Staff was exceptional and very friendly. Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"excellent service. great ambiance. food was awesome! great hang out. They let us bring a birthday cake and allowed us to use birthday decorations. Had so much fun. for a Party of 10-12 ppl expect to spend atleast $500 thats is with games, membership, food and drinks plus gratuity."}
{"text":"YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE A GOLFER TO COME HERE! 

Just get on over there and have some fun. We were a variety of beginners and (wanna be) pros. It was such a fun time and we can not wait to come back. 

Also, their breakfast burger is out of this world....YES!...The food is actually great, and not too overpriced. 

Great place for group activities, but expect a wait."}
{"text":"Guy night out last night, and we went to Top Golf....one word pretty much sums it up, AWESOME! 

Upon arrival, we were told to either choose valet or set park at MGM. There was not charge (only tip) for valet, so we chose that option. 

The line to check in was about 10 deep, but moved quickly. (Saturday night about 10:30pm). They told us it would be 1-1.5 hr wait for the bottom two floors and a 2+ hr wait for the third floor (which is 21 and older and has a pool). 

Our number came up faster than promised, and we were escorted to our bay by a friendly staffer. She explained the different game modes (there are several). Then she recommended some options. Quickly after her training, another girl showed up to take our food & drink order. The food came fast and was top notch. 

For three guys, we spent 1.5 hours, got in two games, and enjoyed some great food. 

We will be back for sure. 

Pros: 
The facility is amazing
The variety of games will appeal to different types and skill levels of players 
Food was good
Absolutely professional, helpful, good-looking friendly staff
Plenty of of entertainment options while you wait for your turn to golf

Cons:
Price was a little high (go with a generous friend) ;-) 
Each player must pay a $5 \"membership\" fee to play
Lots of stairs (though there is an elevator)"}
{"text":"The check in process could use some simplification. It took them 18 minutes to check us in and set us up in a bay. They charge an additional $5 for each player card if this is your first time, which is fine for those who plan to come often but is a superfluous expense for those passing through. There was one instance where my ball hit the center flag of one of the score pits and did not register any points, which pretty much renders the scoring system useless."}
{"text":"Visited this location on a quiet Sunday night around 11pm. Topgolf is conveniently located right behind the strip and luckily there was no wait to sign up (just a little wait for them to set up our area). Sunday night rate was $60 for 1 hour for up to 6 people in 1 bay plus an additional $5 pp if you're new because you have to sign up for a membership.

While we waited for our bay, we played some table shuffleboard (they ran out of sand, what? Lol but we made do) for about 10 minutes before we headed up to the 3rd floor to hit some golf balls! We also played some cornhole after our golfing session which was awesome. So much space to hang out!

Each area is nice with a L-shaped couch and table. Your area comes with clubs and 2 monitors to keep score of your points. There's also wait service if you want to order drinks or food (chicken wings were delish!). This is definitely a group activity for the fun factor, but having a lot of people means you hit less balls, so you decide how you want to play this lol.

I would definitely suggest hitting up this spot if you're in town for a while and don't want to spend every night in the casinos/clubs."}
{"text":"Such a cool place but don't let the coolness blind you. The service is really really bad! I've been there several times and it's always the same. Poor management too! Too many young kids working there that have no  clue what they are doing!"}
{"text":"Even as I write this review I'm still shocked to say I really did enjoy myself at Topgolf. During my bachelor party my groomsmen really wanted to try this spot out. We first attempted around 7 and let's just say it wasn't going to happen. I believe they told us it was going to be between 2-3 hours. We decided to come back later that night and much later. I believe we showed up around 11-12 that night and the wait was around 15 minutes. Their technology is really fun and impressive. The golf balls pop out with just the slightest wave of a club and you're off. The lit up course is a sight to see and it's a true joy to see your ball land in one of the pockets. The screens are fun to see and monitor where the ball lands exactly and how many points are rewarded. The back drop of the Vegas strip is also a beauty to see. Topgolf is a joy for everyone of all ages and whether you even enjoy golf. Just go out with your friends and hit a few balls and just have a good time."}
{"text":"F this place. I came here with 6 of my friends so it was 7 of us total. when we checked in we clearly said there was 7 of us. when they brought us to our golf bay, we all entered our names and i was the last one that was when the guy said \"oh we only allow 6 people\" why the f uck didn't they say this when we checked in? so I sat out while my friends played and didn't participate with them. we will NOT be coming back. good job top golf you guys are lame."}
{"text":"When I started my new job, the company took us here as a welcome aboard/ice breaking night and it was so fun! We had our own 2 tee slots up top in the building, and we had drinks and snacks. The food was awesome-hummus platters, chips and guacamole, sandwiches and pasta.  The drinks were awesome, and the wait staff were super friendly.

There was a gold pro helping us with our swing and aim.  It was very high tech and we were able to keep score and see what we were doin wrong and right.  It was extremely fun, and since work paid I am not sure what the price range was.  But all in all it was very fun and friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We really love going here, even with the kids. It's best to go right when they open- they get busy fast on weekends and holidays. Much more fun than a traditional driving range! The service for food and drinks can be a bit slow at times but the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Fun for all ages and abilities. Helpful attentive waitstaff had name tags with hometowns across the USA.  Food exceeded expectations in variety, flavor and portions.  Shrimp and grits bowl, gluten free, is on the every day menu and was perfect for brunch.  Also gluten free flatbread with prosciutto, olives, and artichoke was a delicious combo. No wait for a bay this weekday morning!"}
{"text":"awesome atmosphere. pool on the 3rd level is perfect for chilling and watching people/sports."}
{"text":"This is absolutely a great place to bring your friends if you want to have a great time! The environment here is great and the food taste amazing. It is bar food style but it taste so good! I've never seen anything like this place. The golfing is fun and also fun to watch other people. Great for a party! Highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"When you hear the word, Las Vegas everything thinks of bachelor/ette or divorce parties so why not add a little daytime fun if you don't plan on doing pool parties (although they do have a pool upstairs.) Great atmosphere, live music, golf, food and booze all in one place. What's not to like? Great thing about it is it's all conveniently located beside the MGM grand so you don't have to drive miles off the strip and get ripped off by taxis. I would highly recommend coming here when in Sin City!"}
{"text":"The kids and I loved it.

Next time I am going myself so I can have a few drinks.

I have never golfed before so I was happy there was a net.

Thank you,"}
{"text":"Our server was wonderful throughout the night and so was the food & atmosphere. However, we were half way through our food and our bay only had 5 minutes left and our server mentioned lengthening our time (we already did once) and we passed because we just wanted to finish our food and leave. We spent $100 at the bar and our bill was $270 at our table. This man, Richard, came out asking us to move to the \"free\" section mid bite. That was probably the most insulting thing he said as if we didn't just spend $370 before a tip. He kept going on and on about the \"policy\" etc. we would have understood if it was 8pm on a Friday or Saturday and it was packed with a wait but it was 10pm on a Tuesday and there were all free bays in sight. My family is in town visiting me and we were trying to enjoy each other's company. We are reasonable and if we planned on staying to \"party\" we surely would have moved. Our family owns restaurants in PA so we know customer service and understand occupying servers tables. Richard should have came over, said hello, thanked us for coming and made the bay idle long enough for us to finish our meal. He should have given her a table out of her section to make up for us staying there (which idk what there would have been to make up for.. a $55 tip..?) and just confirmed we weren't there to party. I have never experienced anything like this in my life and is a sure way to keep people away from Top Golf. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Overall good fun times at Top Golf.  The outdoor patio is a great location to hang out when not golfing,  but they need more! How about a putting green or putting competitions??? Private dining & events?? What's to come Top Golf?"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food!!! We had a fun time whacking balls while enjoying lunch.

I highly recommend the spinach & goat cheese salad, especially for other gluten free folks!"}
{"text":"I love Topgolf! I feel there is always a fun time to be had by anyone, golfer or not. I personally had never golfed in my life prior to visiting Topgolf a few years back. Some days I am an awesome golfer, beating those in my party who actually do golf. Booyah, in the target, again!

The food is delicious and the servers are usually pretty awesome as well. I love their doughnut filled things as a nice sweet treat. The 

I also tend to enjoy the music that they play every time I am in there and love that the bays have their own heat source during the cooler months. I feel it is a little bit costly to partake in on the regular but still a fun spot to visit every now and again. 

When I first visited topgolf, it was a Saturday and they had a guy walking around making balloon animals for the littles for tips. I am not sure if he is still there on Saturdays but it was definitely a cool things to have. 

They have a few waiting areas and \"play\" areas that have a wii, giant jenga and some other fun things to do as well. Be aware, they do have a wait a lot of the time during their peak hours. Which having something else to do while waiting (wii, etc) is very helpful. 

As I said, this place is good for people of all walks. They have left handed clubs upon request for the leftys and we have taken our 8 year and 11 year old there and they tend to enjoy it as well. 

The membership card is a bit of a pain because I lose mine, without a doubt, every single time. Granted it's only $1 to replace cards ($5 for a new card) but still... I know I'm out an additional $1 almost every time. You are a member for life upon sign up and it isn't too difficult to get a new card so long as the line isn't too long. 

I know we'll be back time and time again as we often are."}
{"text":"1.) Nothing comes with your $45 \"membership\"
2.) Aweful costumer service - literally grabbed food from under guest and threw it away.
3.) Bad experience

Great concept for entertainment. However, our group member accidently grabbed food from the buffet in the back, he didn't realize it was for a private party. One of the employees came over and understandably reprimanded him. He apologized for the mistake, offer to pay for it and apologize to party. Although I tried to stop the employee, they took the fresh food from under him and threw it right in the garbage! 

They ignored our solution and chose an ignorant one. When I reminded the manager that people die from starvation  + an animal was slaughtered for the food,  he claimed there was no other way to handle the incident.

..so the answer was to GRAB THE FOOD FROM UNDER YOUR GUEST AND THROW IT IN THE TRASH??! Riiiiggghhtt...never going there again."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun. I've been to the Scottsdale one, and this is exactly the same. It is kind of like cornhole, but with golf. I happen to not be very good at it, but it's still fun. The mornings are cheaper to go, but the atmosphere at night is awesome. Food is really good too.  All around great place."}
{"text":"Let me just say the golf was fun, I went on a slow day. Nevertheless, the customer service and food was horrible. If you go here I definitely recommend eating somewhere else first. The menu makes the food look delicious and tasty, but I assure you it is extremely overpriced and bland at best. I ordered a grilled cheese with brisket in it. The bread was sponge like and soaked in grease. Almost like bad garlic bread. The brisket was bloody and bland. Ordered some cheese fries with bacon, was tasteless and barely had any fries. My brother ordered some nachos. Only 6 chips on the nachos like it was some kind of exclusive item. The funny thing is all the food is presented well like a chef made it but tasted worse than microwavable entrees.

Besides the food, customer service is frustrating and quite rude. The server was more than kind, but the management was not. Halfway through our first game the system stopped despensing golf balls. We waited 30+ minutes to get maintenance to show up. When they did they opened up their despensing system and fixed it now problem like the server could of flipped a switch. Then they offered to reimburse us for the time we lost waiting for maintenance. A whole whopping 15 minutes. We asked for an hour to which maintenance scoffed and said \"not happening\". Don't blame him though, because the second incident revealed the real problem.

We then went on with the game and enjoyed ourselves. We of course had to pay for another hour. No biggy it's the nature of their business. Wish it was less expensive but I know they have to make money somehow. When we decided to use their wonky computer system to buy an extra hour (look into a manual approach to buying more time guys I saw servers using their system, it's an inconvenience to make your customers use your automatic system.) It showed the wrong time, so we decided to ask for some reassurance from the server to know we aren't paying more for time we aren't using. The server quickly grabbed a manager. The manager was rude and insulting to the server and to me. Quickly cutting me and the server off when we tried to explain the question with \"I don't see what the problem is.\" \"So what's the problem\" in a rude and annoyed attitude. Eventually just walking away and not helping whatsoever."}
{"text":"Very cool place for all ages... The food is pretty good and not over priced. Theres a bit of a waiting time but its well worth it, its also got the Beautiful Vegas view..."}
{"text":"Really a great place!  Awesome scenery!  Great idea and game.  Bar and food was good but way too expensive."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday because they advertise a mimosa brunch with $5 mimosas and bloody marys and we were also going to visit the pool. However, just about the entire place was blocked off for private events including the brunch area (therefore no brunch and no specials) and the pool. If you're there to watch a game it's really not worth it. The TV area is cool but the food and drinks are way too expensive, not to mention their beer selection is very limited. Go here if you're actually going to golf or are lucky enough to be invited to a private event (which likely happen a lot)."}
{"text":"Finally made it here on July 3rd around 7:30. Parking was a nightmare, we were finally able to nag a spot after a long time searching. We bought our membership cards online and put our name in without much hassle. We were quoted 2.5-3 hours but it ended up being less than 2. While we waited we went to the main floor bar. Service was difficult. After greeting us he took my husband's drink order and ran away without getting mine. One friend had to wait nearly an hour for a drink. We had to flag down the waiter to get napkins. The wait staff needs some practice and numerous addition servers, everyone looked frantic. The actual gameplay was really fun! I'm not a golf person and I had a great time. The service at the table was great. I'm so glad this place opened!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a group outing. It's located in the back of the MGM Grand. You don't have to know how to golf to enjoy your time here. They have a beautiful pool and is a great way to spend your afternoon. They also have other games in the main lobby with lots of TVs. The food here is also very good and it can be catered to your golf area. 

The service that we had here was great and we all had such a good time. I would definitely come here again for another group event."}
{"text":"Don't let my photos fool you - this is the place to go if you are looking for slow service, sassy service, mischarges, and cold food. Is anyone looking for those things though? 

I heard the HYPE around Topgolf and was really excited to take my mind off Hurricane Irma at Topgolf with some family. Unfortunately, the experience was one of the worst I've ever had. Please note: this is only my 2nd 1st review EVER.

The line was out the door, so I assumed that the hype was right and it would be worth the wait. We were quoted about an hour or two for a bay, but we didn't have a problem with that since we were hungry. We went to an open rooftop bar to grab drinks and lunch. After 30 minutes, we realized that we weren't going to be served without hunting someone down.

Finally, we ordered and got our drinks. First, they brought out four appetizers when we only ordered two. Unfortunately, our server had us pay BEFORE we got our food since we were going to move to a bay, and we paid an extra $18 for the two appetizers that we didn't order. Granted that's our fault for not paying closer attention to the bill.

We moved to the bay, and our server told us that he'd have our food brought to the new bay. When it finally came, there were a lot of missing items from the order, and the food was cold. Most likely, the food had been sitting for a while since our first server was not very bright. Our server at the bay didn't make our experience any better. I actually ordered two more beers from a server at another bay since our server Jessie never came back for us. Corrie was the server that I hunted down, and he did get me the two beers but I had to open a separate tab with him.

The manager did stop by but her customer service skills were no better than anyone else that we interacted with. She blamed us for the problem, didn't listen to the situation, and didn't have any resolution before she just walked away...

Your money and time would be better spent somewhere else. The IDEA is fantastic, but the execution is horrible."}
{"text":"Great food. Great sport. Great everything. Highly recommend going to this place. They also have free pool and foosball down stairs. Everything on the menu was also fresh and excellent"}
{"text":"Been here several times in the past year and I always have a great time!! The nachos are killer and the drinks are reasonably priced. This is also the only way I can get my girlfriend to play golf with me so it's a win win!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here, it's fun and relaxing. They have great food actually too and you pay just as much as you would at a restaurant so Idk why people complain. And yes it's busy on weekends because it the only thing to do in San Tan Valley, Queen Creek and Gilbert, other than going to the mall so don't be to impatient because it's worth it! Go before 5 on a week day if you want to just try it out without paying the most per hour. The waitors/waitress aren't the best on filling drinks or checking up on you but I don't mind I'm trying to golf! :)"}
{"text":"I have been here several times.My children have a blast here. But I always have problems with their food ! This Saturday was my sons birthday. He ordered a hamburger med it came out well done and the tots were luke warm at best. You could tell the plate was sitting for a whole the gentleman who brought us the order could not even touch the plate so you can just imagine. The bad thing this has happened more than once . The server was apologizing and the manager came over
which was nice but a simple burger ."}
{"text":"great idea. an ultimate driving range with food, drinks, music, pool, and free games. golf is time based cost and clubs/balls provided.  up to 6 in a bay and time extended as needed, like a rock and bowl feel. different type of scoring games and flatbread was decent"}
{"text":"The burgers are fantastic, diet doesn't matter, grease laden confections, and when TG first opened it was a joy to dine there. 

Then they decided it needed to be a night club. 94db thumping pounding music in the restaurant area with no one else dining. We'd go more and spend more if it went back to the way it was - a good balance of music and an ability to hear others at the table. Save the hearing loss for the upper bar or when it's busy."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Hampton Inn right across the field from top golf. I was in a skirt and flip-flops and it was very easy to walk across the field to get to the spot.  This place was lit up and three stories of amazing condo golf!!! I was only here on a business trip but this is a Great spot! Easy to get started, everyone was welcome... Server comes to you with cocktails and food. Clean, organized and professional! Fun fun fun! I would come here again and again! I wish we had one in RENO!"}
{"text":"How amazing is this place?!?!? Our friends brought us here the first night we arrived in Gilbert.  What an awesome concept! The staff is SO friendly, and clearly in love with their jobs.  They dance around the whole place with smiles on their faces, as if they were on vacation.  It truly exudes a positive, entertaining, energy to their customers. 

There were 5 of us who got a bay on the 3rd floor.  Our waitress explained the game to us and told us how the golf balls have microchips and knows who is hitting the ball, while also calculating which colored circle it lands in/on. 

We all had a great time playing, while ordering drinks and apps.  The food - the entire smorgasbord we ordered, was delish! We were in town during the Superbowl, and even happened to run into some Buffalo Bills players at a bay a couple spots down from us (disclaimer - this was exciting; we are fans from Buffalo!!).

We were lucky enough to return one more time during our trip, this time in daylight.  The view is even better during the day with the beautiful mountains as the backdrop."}
{"text":"TopGolf is a lot of fun but you have to be aware going in that it is going to be expensive! More than your local driving range and a lot more expensive than your local hometown Topgolf.  Luckily I had an inside hookup and it cost me about 50% less than what it would have normally cost to have a birthday party there.

The games are really fun for all skill levels.  The food is excellent for basically bar food but again not cheap.

Our server was great and attentive and the food came at a good pace.  Hopefully I'll have the same great experience the next time that I come."}
{"text":"We didn't golf and didn't care...that's how much fun this place was! The Friday of March Madness was epic.  They were slammed and the service was slow, but they apologized and it wasn't a big deal because the energy was incredible.  Really a must-do in Vegas.  The menu is huge and everything we ordered was delicious.  We regret not making a reservation, but it's noted for next time!! See you soon."}
{"text":"The game itself wouldn't register many of the scores. The tee was as high as the surface of the carpet. Software sucked, we couldn't enter players that came later. Hit a ball in the hole and did nothing. Topgolf is a real joke, more like an expensive driving range. I had 15 people there for a Birthday and embarrassed myself. Never again!! Matter of time before people catch on to you!"}
{"text":"So much fun. Something different to do off the strip. 

You don't have to be an amazing golfer! Game is super easy to play. Staff was awesome! Shoutout to our \"bay host\" amber! You are the real MVP.  She was super personable and complimented my girlfriend on her swings! Thanks for making our first time a great time!  

Also the blended Moscow mule was delicious!  Came here during the day but can't wait to be back to try a night game!"}
{"text":"My first time here was SO much fun, so much unexpected fun. I'd heard good things , and knew they were expensive , but I was really surprised when I walked in. 

There's so much space . There are 3 levels with bays. We ended up on the lowest level which was very nice. Our section has high top tables , and there are some booths as well. 

There are heaters and fans to keep you comfortable in all seasons and a very accommodating waitstaff, who will help you get set up on your game and bring drinks and food. I had a strawberry margarita which was okay, and no food.

Once set up on the game , you get to choose from various male and female clubs to hit balls dispensed from a machine at your bay. The point is to shoot for accuracy . Accuracy being as close to one of the flags as possible. 

They open as early as 9AM and stay open late. This is a great place to burn a lot of time , and fun while doing it."}
{"text":"A really good time if you wanna do something in Vegas especially at night with some friends! The food and drinks are great as well. 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Damn, that was fun. Ordering drinks and food can be a bit of a hassle and needs work but the server was freakin' cool/chill. I guess with a group as big as we had, on a very busy night, things can get hectic, but every thing came out great. Thanks!"}
{"text":"If you're going to TopGolf you pretty much know what you're getting. It's a driving range with beer and some higher end pub food. It's pretty expensive and there is a very long wait if you don't make a reservation (reservations cost $50 and that doesn't go towards food or golf) and even with a reservation expect to wait 15-20 minutes to be seated. The staff is very friendly and the service is quick. Can't go wrong with TopGolf for a relaxing night with friends."}
{"text":"I can't believe I just gave a golf place 4 stars... I was a skeptic before showing up, but here's the rundown: 

The excellent:

* The golf - Lots of fun. I'm not a golfer, most of the people in our group of 15 were not golfers. We got a \"private suite\" with two bays in it for golfing, and it was perfect for our group of 15. We didn't actually follow the rules, we just hit balls, and everyone had fun. 

* The food - This was the biggest shock for me. The food was actually REALLY good. We had a BBQ plate, and the meat was awesome. It came with delicoius texas toast, and pickled veggies. It was great. The sushi plate was surprisingly great also. One of the \"rolls\" had crispy rice as a base, and it was awesome. I'm craving some now. 

The not so great: 

* The drinks - This was a big bummer. The drinks were REALLY watered down. Drinks on casino floors are better than these drinks here, and these were expensive. Order a bottle and mixers instead of individual drinks unless you like something really specific. 

* The cost - It wasn't cheap. I wasn't paying, but I know we had a $1100 bar and food minimum for our group, and it wasn't hard to spend it. That's on top of the cost of golf (which I think was $500/hour ???)

All in all, it was a lot of fun, and if someone else is paying I'd do it again."}
{"text":"Good concept but Oh my god the service is very very bad, we had to ask to get a waiter to take care of us after being seated for 10min.
Ordered drinks that came within 5 min 
We also ordered food that we waited on for 30 min now get this!
We ordered chips and guac and nachos ...? 30min?
Also super cold waiter after drinks empty, no water.


Manager was nice and took care of the cold nachos...
That was the minimum take care of the darn nachos!

Anyway go have fun with drinks and golf but don't eat."}
{"text":"Always a fun time and friendly staff. Food is really good, a little expensive but still good. I love that we can sit and relax and have fun hitting balls."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience here. Great concept, fairly good customer service. Good food. Aim to be at least on the second level for a better experience where you can see and aim for (esp the rear targets). You might want to make a reservation; the second level had a 1.5 hr wait-time on Saturday night. Got some discount cards from MGM. I would recomment it and I would come back here."}
{"text":"My new favorite thing to do in Vegas. I had driven by this place so many times over the last few months and knew it would be a fun place to visit. But I had no idea..this place is awesome in every sense of the word. The driving range, the tvs everywhere, the bars..and the pools?! I'll make sure to dive in on my next visit. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Really great idea and super fun place to play/party day or night! The reason I am not giving 5 stars is that the employees appeared to have very little oversight. Groups of employees blocking the front desk and hallways laughing and flirting with each other while there were dirty tables and no toilet paper in the bathrooms."}
{"text":"We came on a family vacation for Mother's Day and this was such a cool place for everybody! You have the best view of the strip and their customer service was great!"}
{"text":"So it looks like I have a new favorite place in the universe. 

While I'm a loud and vocal proponent of all things mini-golf, I had never before stepped foot onto a driving range. I don't know what I was doing with the past 35 years of my life, but I do know it all sucked compared to my time at Topgolf. This place is the shiz.

When we arrived we were escorted to our reserved stations, which had climate-controlled couch seating in the back, and some pretty dang high-tech tees up in the front. The system is able to scan a sensor in your golf ball and if you hit one of their targets, you get points! Matt Fact: I LOVE POINTS! It's my philosophy that everything in life is a competition, some more obvious than others. If I'm able to objectively show that I scored more points than somebody else, then I'm having a pretty great day. 

While waiting for your turn, you can hang back with pretty good food and drink, brought to you be a server. I was particularly fond of the Palomas, and all of the bites I sampled were tasty. 

This would be a great date, double date, friend outing, or company team builder. I can't wait until they open a location closer to my home in Portland."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun!!! I flew in super late at 12:30 am and went here straight from the airport at 1 am. Surprisingly, this place was super packed! There are different levels for the game so it's ideal for anyone -- even golf noobs like me :) 

Although I didn't try/order any food, my friends did and they all seemed to enjoy the fried shrimp, edamame, and chicken skewers.

Great for groups and a night out of a different kind of Vegas fun :0)"}
{"text":"Customer service here is gone. People are rude, what happened to this place. Will not recommend."}
{"text":"A great place to take family and friends. Kid friendly. Would be great for a date night, bachelor party or corporate function. Great facility, great food and wonderful service."}
{"text":"My first experience at topgolf was at the Las Vegas location. It was such a fun experience. It was a pretty cold evening compared to Phoenix and they had large area heaters that warmed up the Bay Area. The food and drinks were great, even for small snack and apps or even a large meal."}
{"text":"I am totally impressed with a quick response from one of their managers and will definitely give their location another chance.
The ambiance was very intriguing, loved the cleanliness of bar and reception area."}
{"text":"This year for my Company's Team Appreciation Event, we went to Top Golf, I cannot tell you how excited I was, and I'm not even a golfer, unless you count mini golf haha.

My plus one ordered us some strawberry jalapeno margarita , and those were perfectly spicy & sweet. Our server Kayla (who was freaking amazing!!) told us about some locally brewed beers they have on tap, and sold me on the Koffee Kolsch, which was like a cold brewed coffee, smelt delish and tasted great, you got the full flavor of caramel and hazelnut , this was a great tasting beer!

We had dinner catered by Top Golf,  it consisted of Pickled Fried Chicken, Slow Smoked Beef Brisket, Green Chili Mac & Cheese, House Baked Beans, freshly baked rolls, salad & the fixings and bbq sauce, pickled onions & slaw and unlimited water, sodas, teas & coffee.

The pickled fried chicken was pretty good chicken, the freshly baked buns with the beef brisket topped with pickled onions & slaw drizzled in the bbq was the bomb.com. I had high hopes for the green chili mac & cheese, but sadly it was the loser of the night, not only did it seem to not have the cheese, it was bland, no flavor, no salt, and yes you saw the green chili, but even they lacked the flavor. Just say no to the green chili mac & cheese, everything else is great!

Now on the golfing, we had about 10 bays reserved, and after some great help from TopGolf staff we were all set up and ready to play, I have to tell you, I didn't really think this was going to be that fun, but boy oh boy was I wrong! I think I have found my game, such a rush hitting the ball and watching it fly and land in one of colored goals!  I was channeling my inner Tiger Woods! So much fun!

Honestly cannot wait to come back to TopGolf,  this place is fun for all ages, perfect for date nights, or just hanging out with friends!."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't written a review for this Topgolf yet! 

Its becoming one of my favorite goto places in the valley when looking for something fun to do.

If you are thinking eeewww golf, you shouldn't, really, Topgolf is fun! It's like a hybrid of mini golf & skeet ball
  
One think I like about this place, there is no hidden cost, a bay is a flat rate, from open to 12 pm its $25 per hour, from 12pm to 5pm $35 per hour and 5pm to close $45 an hour, and for a bay of 6 you can easily get through a game within that hour.

Topgolf also serves food and drinks, has some gaming systems and pool tables if not ready to leave yet.

Seriously, this is some fun times, take your family, go with friends, make it a date night, but go and have fun!"}
{"text":"I came here for a company event & it's pretty cool. It's not your typical driving range. They serve food, drinks, and each section is like a lounge. It's basically like a socializing lounge with the option to golf. 

The food is really good too. My company had the BBQ platter & ended with the donuts... and omg, they were bomb.com!

The price is definitely pricey compared to regular driving ranges, but if you split the cost, it's reasonable (food & beverage are additional cost).

There are 3 different levels: 1st level, lounges for each group is a bit small. 2nd floor lounges are more spacious, and 3rd floor lounges are more VIP looking. You can even rent a private lounge that's all pimped out & even has mini-kitchen/wet bar.

During summer they have a pool area that looks pretty cool as well... makes me wonder how crazy packed the pool gets tho!

Overall, it's a cool place which definitely presents the Vegas lifestyle."}
{"text":"Being a local who frequently plays golf I've got to give Topgolf a 3 Star rating.

It's a fun place there's no doubt about that. But what is unfortunate is how long you can have to wait for something quite pricey and short. Now the price does make sense, they aren't located so close to the LV Strip for nothing.

Regardless the price paid for the bay, drinks, and appetizers at the end of the night was enough for me to think of it as a one or two time thing. It's a cool experience and I felt like their service was great!"}
{"text":"I always have a great time at top golf. Be prepared to spend some money, but if you bring 5 friends with you it will be quite a bit less expensive, as the bays can hold up to six people to divide up the cost. They have a full menu, and bar too! The food is usually good, I will say the nachos are EXTREMELY over priced. You pay for a dollar a chip for the nachos.

Though some of the food is overpriced, it is worth it for a great time. Be prepared to get addicted to Top Golf!"}
{"text":"Lauren from Kansas City and Al are awesome! They took such great care of us for my husbands birthday, even treating us to complimentary donuts with extra Bavarian cream. Great place to hang with family or friends. Best choice for sharing are the flatbreads. The nachos are built as individual chips, so not ideal for sharing with more than 2 people like normal nachos."}
{"text":"They seem to always have wait, we arrived at 11a and were told there was a 30 minute wait. The wait must have been longer as the line was almost out the door as we left 2.5 hours later.  We had fun and it was a good experience. Nice atmosphere to hang out and hit some golf balls."}
{"text":"While I want to give this 3.5 stars, Yelp only allows full stars so dropping to a 3! This was a lot of fun and really cool concept - don't get me wrong, but gets expensive and QUICK. We played an hour with 3 people and then extended it 30 minutes, had a few beers and one app. It was $130 bucks. Also the \"supreme nachos\" were ten bucks and literally had 8 chips on the plate. This is a sports bar and golfing venue - no need to try and be fancy / pretentious. When I ask for nachos at a sports bar give me NACHOS. Service was ok, nothing special but have had worse."}
{"text":"Used to frequent Topgolf when I lived in Chicago, so I had an idea what to expect. The difference is this one in Vegas evidently cost 50 million vs. 18 million the others would typically cost. 

PROS
+ 20% locals discount for play, be sure you show your idea
+ lots of TVs, even big screen projectors across the range
+ pools on the 3rd and 4th floors, would be nice to have an option to go for a dip when it's 110+ degrees out
+ excellent customer service from start to finish
+ decent food, paid about $15 for the nacho stack with chicken and shared with 2 others
+ nice view of the strip

CONS
- naturally overpriced, being on the strip, $60/hr on a Friday between 12-5pm (cheaper if you go before noon!)
- longer waits, anywhere from 15-90min on the day we went (Black Friday)

TAKEAWAYS
* come before noon Monday-Thursday for cheapest pricing
* ask for Bay 1 or 2 (less expensive)
* locals' discount
* eat a meal before or after, prices add up with the cost of play and booze
* if there's no parking, can take a free shuttle from the MGM main lobby, runs about every 20 minutes"}
{"text":"I'm always recommending this place for any group activity that I can think of! It's great for the amateurs and even fun for the pros. There is usually a long wait (we waited 1.5 hours on a Saturday night) but they have pool tables and a few other games to occupy your time. 

Food wise, tons of great snacks, with an impressive number of vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"A bit on the pricey side but am awesome venue for parties and hanging out with friends, even if you suck at golf like I do."}
{"text":"Omg!  My husband is an avid golfer and I am not.  I had as much fun here if not more than he did at Top Golf!  Plenty to see and do even if you are not golfing.  I loved the video poker at the bar and the pool.  The gift shop had a lot of unique items.  I definitely recommend Top Golf even for non-golfers such as myself.  You will have a great time!"}
{"text":"08.10.2017

The family and I came here right after they opened (9:30 am) to beat the heat and beat the crowds. Just FYI, we came here last night at about 9:00 pm and there was a 1-hour wait for a bay. Uhhhh.....no thank you!  So there we were bright and early ready to hit some golf balls and have fun. 

If a driving range and a bowling alley were to have a baby, this place is it! You're welcome to bring your own golf clubs but they also have some for you to borrow, even junior (kids) clubs. An employee walks you to your bay, explains some basics of the concept and enters your players names into the monitor. Similar to bowling, you pay by the hour, up to six players per bay. You will also pay a one-time $5 lifetime registration fee if it's your first time there. 

The object is to hit the targets/flags/holes. The closer to the flag you get, the more points you score. There are a variety of specialty games listed at the back of the menu you can choose to play. Or you can just take turns hitting balls like a normal bowling game or driving range like we did. 

If you're hungry or thirsty your own server comes around to take your food or drink orders and check on you, so similar to a restaurant or bar. We came early but didn't eat here. We had just eaten breakfast before we arrived so we had some water and juice. They had an Early Bird Grub Menu, with choices like breakfast burritos or mini doughnuts. 

This is a great family place--Levels 1 & 2 only. There's cornhole/bean bag toss games and tabletop shuffleboard on the second level, as well. Lots of TVs in the common area where the cornhole and shuffleboard games are, as well as one in your bay and a few way out past the holes and targets. 

For the Happy Hour and 21+ guests, levels 3 & 4 offer more bars and a swimming pool for you. 

We would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Went to top golf for the second time and had a blast! I really like the atmosphere here and the staff is very friendly and the service is top notch. There are many different games to choose from, some are easy and others are more advanced. A great place for anyone to hang out even if you have never hit a golf ball before. They do not allow drivers at this place but you are welcome to bring your own irons if you wish. The music is loud enough to enjoy but not so loud that you have a hard time carrying on a conversation with your team mates. The hourly rates are a bit pricy but I think it is worth the service and nice facility that comes along with it. I will be returning to this location quite frequently."}
{"text":"I'm not a Golfer and only go to a Driving Range when friends ask, this place however is quite awesome! Its a ton of fun and the service is great. If you can make it in the mornings then the prices are much better and the place is a bit more quite, great for families. I recommend staying away at night thou! Yes its a bit more pricey at night but thats not the real turn off, its so insanely busy that your only option is to wait at the bar while having a drink or two before a lane opens, which I guess is not a bad way to start your night at TopGolf."}
{"text":"Great experience on the 3rd floor, great service and good food. Unfortunately the Valet is awful and completely unnecessary."}
{"text":"Came on July 4th. How Americana is that!!! Had another fabulous time here. I brought my nephew who had never here. He loved it. Staff was great. The fans and misters were working hard too. This is a place to have fun, eat awesome food and shoot some golf balls."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place! Came for the first time while visiting for Spring Training. It was so fun and I have never golfed. We hd a group of 6 people adults and children and everyone loved it."}
{"text":"I'm definitely not a golfer nor can i hit a ball but i came here on a recent vegas visit with my bf and his friends. We did have to wait a bit til our stall was ready but its nice that they have couches and some games to play while you wait. We went in early march and it was still a bit chilly at night, it was great that they have heaters on in our stall so we weren't freezing. One thing i liked was that they provide you with golf clubs and its more like a game. They tell you to try to hit towards a certain goal like the yellow flag. My bf, his friend and his friends son thoroughly enjoyed their time and had so much fun hitting balls. We didn't order any food or drinks but I'm sure next time we come back here, we might get some drinks. This place is a bit pricy but its not a bad place if you want to just hang out with friends, eat, drink and golf. a good but different experience from clubbing/partying!

total for 1 hr: $70"}
{"text":"In all fairness, my comments come from the perspective of someone who enjoys play on a course but also looking for an alternative that brings a different level of challenge and just plain fun.  I like the concept Topgolf brings to the table, but there's room for quite a bit of improvement.  When we booked for a birthday in June, the weather was already uncomfortably warm outside.  We knew that the facility had some accommodations by way of fans, but it barely made a dent in our level of discomfort.  We were asking for cups of ice to run over our faces, neck and allowing the water to run down our shirts thinking that the rotating fans might give us more of an evaporative cooling effect. . . but the rotating fans left much to be desired.  Placement of the fans were poor leaving dead spots where there was no movement of air and we were in one of those areas.  Two of us in the party stopped golfing because we were getting sick from heat exhaustion.  The second issue I had with the facility is that they don't allow you to use your own clubs.  This is not going to be a big deal for someone who doesn't really golf or have their own set.  Those of us who do have our own,  have grown into the feel of our clubs. . . I didn't like the generic set and felt it threw my swing off.  I realize this is an entirely personal issue that not everyone will share, but I like consistency and don't like to introduce anything that might effect the memory muscle aspect of the game.  So, I'm not sure the trade-off of just goofing around and having fun is worth it for me.  When asked why I couldn't use my clubs, I was told that people had been hitting outside of the netted area, upsetting homeowners in the area and also causing a hazard to the freeway just on the other side of the net.   That should tell you something about the generic clubs and in my opinion, lending more credence to the poor planning in the design of the facility.  My disappointment comes from the overall experience as a result of these two main limitations.  For the price you pay, I expect more.  It's great for family fun and very young inexperienced golfers who just want to party and experience/incorporate some friendly competition other than moonlight/cosmic bowling.  For me, I will continue to enjoy the local golf courses in the surrounding area."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting and thoroughly enjoyed it. The place is great for team building events. The food is far better than standard bar food. In fact, it was very nice. My favorite drink here was Red Sangria and it was so good that our group in total had about 15 glass of just this drink:) . Highly recommend but make sure to have a reservation to get a good spot."}
{"text":"Wow what an experience! It was pretty cool activity to do with friends without leaving the strip. We went with a group of six on a Tuesday night and only really waited 30 minutes. Time flew because there are tv's and a lively bar atmosphere. 

The structure of the building is new and you can tell with its beautiful light fixtures. After our drunken round of golf, we headed to the Pro Shop. The store itself was super clean and organized. We were assisted by this little red headed girl, Malia? She was able to provide extensive knowledge of the products and great customer service. Although we went in to window shop (and sober up), we ended up buying a couple items. 

My overall experience at TopGolf was an fun one! Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic for sunsets always a friendly atmosphere, tons of games, extras, and great food and drinks."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun! Good times, good food! I can't wait till they open in Roseville!  Thought it was happening this fall. Supposed to be at Blue Oaks and Washington/65.
Update:
I looked at Top Golf website and it says Roseville location to open winter of 16' and Vegas Spring of 16'. I guess I'll have to visit here in Scottsdale area until Vegas opens!"}
{"text":"Topgolf is a fun place for a group of friends, for sure! There are plenty of options on the food and drinks menu, you can even hang out at the bars, shoot pool, or just listen to music. True golfers already know it's more for entertainment and not \"real\" golf. I mean, it's not a driving range or golf course. You don't score points the same way as Tee Time. 

It's great for golfers and non-golfers. However, the wait time is way too long! They estimated 4 hours for our group so we left, had fun somewhere else, then came back and still waited another hour! There has got to be a better estimating system. The staff were friendly. They recommend that we come in the morning when it's not busy. 

Our waitress Vanessa was very nice. Food was good enough to eat. Drinks were decent as well. If you're looking for a fun place to enjoy with friends and family, or kids even, we feel that this Topgolf is a great addition to Charlotte. It's new right now, so it's super busy. Parking can be a pain too. So we will wait until it dies down to come back."}
{"text":"We typically come here several times a month for brunch in the bar area. Normally, everything is great; however, today's experience was the worst and is worth mentioning. We walked into the bar, which was not busy, and we're not greeted for ten minutes. We actually had to stand up and flag someone down for service. Danielle, our server, came over and took our order (both drink and food). Another 15 minutes goes by, and she brings water. Then we wait another ten for mimosa and Chip Shot. Food comes, I ask for more butter - doesn't arrive from Danielle until end of meal. We ordered a refill of both drinks and they don't arrive. She comes to check on food, I told her it would be better with drinks. She failed to even put them in!! Then, she clears our plates, we ask for the tab. Another ten minutes goes by and she does bring out check, she's reading a book behind the bar with the other bartender!  Again, we had to get up to get her attention. Horrible server and service. Jim, the manager, said he's going to get \"actively involved.\" 

I sincerely hope you do."}
{"text":"I don't know why this location lacks compared to Gilbert. We were there this past weekend and the service at the bar was AWFUL on he entry floor. We literally had to flag down the distracted guy and girl bartending by waving or calling out, which we would normally never do. But after waiting 15...20...30 minutes it was ridiculous. They were too busy chatting with their coworkers waiting for drinks to be made. Not to mention the both of them were so rude. Never a smile never a thank you...horrible attitudes. It wasn't busy it was past 11pm and they still sucked. The guy even forgot my drink and when I reminded him he rudely slammed the bottle down I'm shocked it didn't foam up. The games are always fun, location is well maintained, but the service is garbage."}
{"text":"We had the best time for Father's Day!!!! It was a great time for golf, surprisingly cool, great food, and amazing service.  We played two games in two hours and Dad got 5 mins of extra play.  The game makes it easier to play with multiple levels of players.  Great for an event!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the worst customer experiences I have ever encountered and would not have expected from Topgolf, anyone interested in coming here should know they stop sitting at 1am, whole hour before closing. We came in at 1:03 am an they said no to us, turned us away even when they had many driving ranges open. Definitely something they should advertise, very unprofessional service!"}
{"text":"04.06.17 Update:  I received a prompt response to my Yelp review from Trisha Smith who sincerely wanted to make this situation right.  Trisha listened, acknowledged and resolved the issue by offering me choices.  This is the way to exceed customer expectations when a problem is presented.  Thanks Trisha!"}
{"text":"What a great idea for an establishment!!! Had so much fun and atmosphere was great. The food was great had the pulled pork sliders with sweet potato waffle fries..Delicious!!! It's not just hitting balls off a tee either, there are a few different games to choose from. Someone in your party not interest in golfing they have a rooftop pool, huge inside bar are with cor hole and shuffle boards. Tons of TV's everywhere including one you get to control at your golf station."}
{"text":"Price varies on time hitting. We paid 60 for a hour.  Nice idea but if are a bit hitter, then you may be liable for damages if you hit over the fence. Decent price on drinks and food. Great thing is that you have your own server. Giant TV outside the fence area and you can watch in your own stall. Great concept though. If you are in vegas you gotta try it once."}
{"text":"A sporty bro - kinda place!  This includes a driving range, bar, and food.  

Parking: Plenty of parking, but wow this place gets busy. 

Wait time: It varies.  I came on a Friday afternoon, and we waited about 90 minutes. I have heard wait times on weekends can be 3-5 hours.  

Bar:  Basic bar. Nothing special. 

Food:  I did not try any of the meals, but we ate the donut holes. They were a fun choice - donut holes with syringes to insert raspberry, cream, and chocolate.   

Entertainment: There are TVs everywhere, in case one cannot pull him/herself away from whatever sporting event is happening that day. Prices range, dependent on the time of day - cheaper earlier, more pricier after 5pm. 

I am terrible at golf but had fun with friends. I'd likely not go back, less it's for someone's event."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Ask any of the 500 staff a question and undoubtedly it will be \"yes\". There's something for everyone. Even the long waits for golf bay on the weekend don't matter since there's so much to do.

I only give it 4 stars instead of 5 b/c the parking lot is too small on busy nights forcing you to park on the street and walk a long distance."}
{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times. Yesterday we planned celebrating 2 birthdays at TopGolf.  We checked in and let the guy know we had 10 people with 8 people playing golf. After an hour wait, we finally got our spot on the 3rd floor which only had 6 chairs???? Hello top golf I told you I had 10 people. They were kind of accommodating and let us have the seats next to us. The food is great but the SERVICE SUCKS. We ordered drinks and appetizers which took over 30 plus minutes to receive. Very frustrating. I would recommend ONLY coming with 4 or less people. They are not very GOOD at LARGE parties. I had to argue the whole time when I was trying to enjoy my birthday party with my brother. Wouldn't go back unless we had a small group."}
{"text":"First time ever to Topgolf, heard so much about it, I actually live next door to it and watch the construction for over 6 months. I brought my staff  group of 16 people last night..  A few days prior I was on the phone to a lady that said we couldn't book ahead unless we were willing to pay $1000+ for a booth. Kinda just want to play some golf not spend $1000 dollars.. Anyways so I rocked up early to book our locations we were on a waiting list for about an hour an half for 2 booth side by side. No worries we chilled at the top floor had drinks etc quite nice but really just waiting till our bays were ready. Finally get a text message and we got two bays but they were away from eachother (which sucked) it was another 1-2 hours wait to get side by side. No dramas we just made do with what we had. What really annoyed me and reason for my low rating. We just waited 90 min was told only 20-40 min and really wanted booths side by side. We were put way apart and the guy didn't tell us about an additional $5 each person needs to pay, nor did he say having 16 people, you would need 3 booths not 2, I think the staff just assume you know the rules and how it's all done. Anyways, one of the bay's worked, the other bay the computer was stuffed for another half an hour, by then we were just completely over it and got drunk spent over a grand on alcohol and food anyways. Makes me wonder we prob should have did the 1st option. The service was incredible awesome but the Top Golfing experience was really average."}
{"text":"I had soOoOoOo much fun at Topgolf last night!! My coworkers and I got the shop's rating up to 5 stars on Yelp, so our bosses brought us here for a little celebration. Tbh, I had no idea what to expect at first, but I was blown away! This is def the perfect place for a party or fun \"team building\" time, even if not everyone is great with a golf club (like myself.)

Upon arrival, you can either valet your car for cheap or park in the front lot as long as there's space - Mind you, we came on a Sunday night (aka the first football Sunday of the season as well as the night Drake is in town) around 9:30/10:00 PM and there was still lots of parking available. There is also a shuttle that comes to/from the MGM, so you could park there as well - although I'm not not sure if parking is still free there or not... (probably not.)

This place is the love child of a day/nightclub and a driving range. Loud music, neon lights, bottle service, and 4 stories to tee off of. There's even a pool (with a swim-up bar, huge-screen tv, & lounge chairs that are partially submerged) that you can chill out in during the day.

The food and drink menu is pretty impressive as well. We all ordered a little bit of everything: Backyard-style wings, grilled edamame, 3 different kinds of pizza, a hoity-toity meat & cheese platter... They were all so good! Def worth the prices because their flavors were fantastic. The drinks were a'flowin' as well. The waiters tending to us were quick on their feet and eager to help too, which is awesome realizing how needy/hungry we all were.

This place does come with a hefty price tag, so I won't be coming here often... which is why I put 4 stars, but I do plan on coming back eventually!! My friends and I would have so much fun here!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. Finally good food and fun! The spinach salad was perfect. Hubby had club sandwich. I expected bowling food but was totally surprise with the high quality of food. The goat cheese with cinnamon Mouth watering. I loved the golf game easy to play with good golfers and hackers as well. Wives take husbands here for date night"}
{"text":"I was told it would be 15-30 minutes 

I'm just getting a spot an hour and 20 minutes later

Set proper expectation I was told I could start on the first floor immediately I choose to take the 2nd floor because it was a small wait well if I didn't get bamboozled I would have just gone downstairs immediately 

Thanks for ruining my evening"}
{"text":"I will be the first to tell you, I am the worst at golf! When we came here I was kinda concerned that it wouldnt be any fun because I am so bad!!! But, it was quite the opposite! We ordered drinks that were delivered to our area, and food too! I wasn't really worried at all because it was so much fun! There are fans going, and music playing... the vibe is great! And the staff is really attentive... so now I don't really care that I suck at golf, cause now it's fun!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not much of a golfer myself,  but went along with friends and family for a fun afternoon. The building is elegant and the golf setup was really cool. Food was goodish (made up word) and beer selection was excellent.  However, I'm giving 2 stars for the horrific customer service.  That bad. This is my first ever Yelp review of any sort. I literally signed up for Yelp just to write this. Here's what happened. I was a waiter when i was in school and know the restaurant biz. The place was packed and I immediately recognized grossly understaffed. I tried to order a drink at the bar and got a \"one sec hun\" from the bartender lol. I stood there for 5 or so minutes and gave up. My group took an 8 top and we waited for 5 or 10 minutes, but a server never appeared. My brother drew the short straw and went up to the bar and right to a manager (name tag said hospitality manager or something like it). He looked at my brother like he just walked into his house and asked him to make him an omelet. It was hilarious. You could see the panic and sense of urgency in his eyes. My brother came back to our table with this poor, frantic, rushing hospitality leader and he took our drink order. 10 minutes later we were drinking very good beer and in 5 min we needed more. No server ever came to our table. We had to make another trip to the bar - dammit.  Got Mr inhospitable again and 10 minutes later we had our drinks. Wanting food we made the mistake of trying to coordinate a request.  Had two separate servers take our order. We think the first didn't have the photographic memory we assumed they had because ink and paper wasn't involved. Food took 30 min which isnt terrible when it's that busy, but it wasn't hot. Nachos stand out if they're getting cold. That goes back to short staffing and not having proper expo. We then golfed and that was a lot of fun. We had a sever out there and he took forever with drinks and was unfriendly and unhappy. We were there for about 3 hours and I think I had 4 beers. I would have liked to buy more. I cant be the only one complaining about Top Golf's cust service woes and I'm sure with the amount of money they're making they'll get there act together at some point, but I won't go through that circus again anytime soon. The company needs to hire just a couple more bartenders and a half dozen servers and train them, properly. Currently they have an awful front of the house management team and wait staff."}
{"text":"Top golf is great to go to with family or friends. Enjoy a little bit of competitive fun, have an adult beverage or two, and enjoy some great food."}
{"text":"Pretty much fun for anyone, even for a girl who's never gone golfing! 

If you don't have a reservations, the wait is the only downside but there's some fun bar games, drinks and good appetizers for you while you wait it out! 

Some people complain about the price but I thought it was worth the time and enjoyed having our own private space."}
{"text":"Spending our Saturday night here was the best idea ever!  Service is phenomenal here. The staff is super attentive! It's very impressive!  Food was tasty and the bottle service was worth every penny. S/O to all the staff that helped us at table 306.  

It's a great alternative to have fun if you've already had your nightclub fix in Vegas and are looking for a chill night but still entertaining time.  

I'm definitely coming back again, no doubt."}
{"text":"We visited TopGolf-Las Vegas on Saturday afternoon.  We happened to pick a day when there was nothing going on in Vegas.  We waited for an hour for a Bay on the 2nd level and we're joined by our friends who live in Vegas but had not been to TopGolf before.  Brock took great care of us, explaining everything we needed to know to play.  We played two games of TopGolf before the heat got to us, but it's Vegas in June  -- what could we expect??  The food was brought quickly and our drinks were refilled on request.  Looks like my friends are hooked.  We had a great time.  Even if my game is totally inconsistent, we always enjoy our visits to TopGolf.  Although it was hotter than Hades, we swing with the best of 'em!  Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Great service (locals get 20% off), a little pricey, try and go 9AM-Noon during a weekday, $30 per hour. Great time though."}
{"text":"This place is so cool! We went on a double date here and it was awesome! Michelle (from Boston) was the best! She took care of us and made sure we had everything we needed! Food was excellent and drinks we great! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This is the first time at TGolf in Vegas.  It is much nicer than some of the other locations as one might expect.  We had a family group and found ourselves with an hour wait as they don't reserve here.  We left and went to eat...paged while eating but they gave us another 60 minutes.  This was good.  Returned and waited a little but was able to get a \"booth\" and lessons on playing.  Unfortunately it took about 15 minutes to instruct us and set up two memberships.  Playing w 6 poeple is a chore and we didn't have enough time to finish the game so we added 30 minutes.  All worked out at the end as we each were able to hit another 10 balls before out time expired.
The check out interesting as they charged us for 4 memberships which we already paid for before coming.  Front desk confirmed same prior to us playing.  We also mentioned resident which wasn't on the bill.  The server was good and apologized and had the charges adjusted.  I had 5 receipts as the booth was one, beer another, gift card another, total itemized and then the final bill.  I asked again to be sure which after checking my cc appears to be correct.  
Overall it was a nice time with great views...advice would be to make sure your invoices are correct and you sign in for membership days prior (which always isn't possible for visitors).  Since you can't reserve a regular 6 person booth, you should allow hours with wait and play."}
{"text":"Great venue to hang out at besides the cash in in Vegas. 4 star because it was a 3 hour wait for a bay! A bay fits up to 10 people, and can have up to 6 players at a time. The drinks and food are decently priced. I had a golf bag drink, tastes good and the injectable doughnut holes, interesting concept, choose your flavor and you put as much filling in them as you'd like.  There are free games around while you wait like corn hole and Jenga. They have multiple levels. 2 levels have a pool on them and I was another level with a dj and dance area."}
{"text":"If only they had a vegan option, I would give a 5 star. 

I came here for a company event, the place is huge, fun vibe and staff. The drinks hit the popular list from an Old Fashioned and Moscow Mule to IPA and Bud Light. The menu is pretty chain-y with your typical burgers, wraps and salads. They do have a veggie burger but alas, it had egg. Whhhyyy, just go full vegan or don't bother. 

As far as the golf itself, just to preface a little, I don't golf. I barely miniature golf and usually just recite Happy Gilmore the whole time. I may have done that a few times here. Okay, so, it's great for beginners! They have all the clubs you need for both righties and lefties (me) with the lit up stations to aim. If you're bold and aim for the back fence you get the big points! The views here are pretty amazing too. Seating is ample, comfy and accommodating with the outdoor heaters. 

Overall, this place is pretty fun. Great location for group events. I just wish they would add JUST ONE vegan option."}
{"text":"As a local, this was the first time I have played TopGolf in Las Vegas. My son-in-law was in town from Seattle and wanted to go. We walked up with no reservation and had a slot on level one within 15 minutes. It was fun. I will be going back and in fact I will probably be hosting future events for a group of my Vegas Bros.

I brought my own driver and used the house provided drivers for our chipping game.

Our server Jewell was the best. She really stood out for her attentiveness and her sincere friendliness plus she laughed at my jokes. She is why I gave you 5 stars when it should have been 4 stars based on the following:

108 climate-controlled hitting bays - There are these vents slightly behind the booth blowing air. Not cold air. Just air. I asked a number of the staff why the air was not cold and was told it was hit or miss. And the excuse that the air was warm because it is hot out is the wrong answer. Of course it is hot out, it's Vegas in the summer. Please define \"climate controlled\". Needs to be cold air. #HVAC

I think TopGolf needs to have a locals discount. You are making plenty of money off of tourists. If you want more locals to return more often, $28 pitchers of beer does not cut it or at least offer locals hitting bay discounts during non-peak times."}
{"text":"It was fun but a little pricey for what we had. 1 hour of golf, a beer, a cocktail, sliders and wings was $120. Just a little pricey!."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I was definitely the biggest naysayer when it came to trying out Topgolf. For some reason, I just assumed it would be like every other mini golf/driving range/ sports bar, and I always declined invitations to attend. How wrong I was! It should be noted,that I am reviewing top golf during a beautiful spring day on a Sunday afternoon. I have no idea how crowded it is in the evenings for the rest of the week.  

First off, the place is incredibly well organized, and has plenty of staff to assist in all your needs, albeit most of them are only about 18years old!  After paying a nominal card fee, you are taken to your assigned driving range area complete with private booths, TV, and semi personal waiters.  The food is really good and pretty clever.  We ordered taters, chicken fingers, sliders, pizza, waffles and chicken, Mexican \"sushi roll\".   Nothing was greasy, everything was high quality, tasty, and served with care.  The presentation of the food was also very creative.   ( see all the pictures)

I definitely will be coming back not only for the driving range but for the food!"}
{"text":"Wait times could be long but definitely worth the wait if you're with a large group. Drinks and table prices are fairly priced and it's a great atmosphere if you decide to skip a night at the clubs. No other place i would love to get hammered and hit golf balls."}
{"text":"Great experience and I must do when into Vegas! If you can pay extra for the top floor DO IT. 

I'm not a professional but their equipment had some dents in them and probably not straight. As to be expected food and drinks are on the spendy side but nothing too outrageous. 

I'm definitely going to make this a new tradition in our upcoming Vegas trips. 

We walk from Caesar's Palace to top golf thinking I wasn't going to be that bad but it was farther than expected. I do recommend taking a taxi or their shuttle that leaves from MGM"}
{"text":"Great time. Prices were affordable. Parking situation was a bit ridiculous. You can't even get cars in and out of the driveway at the same time. We waited longer to get out than we did for our golf bay."}
{"text":"The bartender's tonight are the absolute worst. A couple dudes with no personality, walk right past you with empty drink glasses. They have no skills and no clue. You need girls behind the bar. These guys suck bad. Have watched many customers wait for a long time to get drinks and some got up and left."}
{"text":"Topgolf rocks! My friend is visiting from out-of-town and loves this place now. Our bartender Lindsey was excellent and had amazing recommendations for drinks. Order the Moscow Mule with tequila instead !!!"}
{"text":"Place has amazing potential.  Thought it'd be a good place to bring my buddies on a bachelor party.  Cool golf idea, great open spaces for games pool and bars... Even staff all seem to want to help.  Only problem is none of their tech works!  It was a joke.  The golf games were difficult to operate, everyone was constantly having to paw at a touchscreen to get it to switch users.  And their billing system took an hour to get me a check to sign.  Not between asking for a bill and getting it back, this is a full hour standing next to the manager operating the register glaring at him because I was in a rush at that point. 

To top it off there was no attempt to offer a discount or a future credit or anything."}
{"text":"I had a less than stellar experience at the bar . The manager Cannon got wind of this and he could not have been more nice and professional . He apologized for the bar service and gave us a fantastic top golf experience ! Our server at the bay Celeste was great as well and she even gave my fiancé a quick golf lesson . I will definitely return . If top golf corporate happens to read this you have a tremendous manager in Cannon."}
{"text":"Well it was not all that and a bag of chips for me but had a good time. Food was fair.. Drinks ok. Service ok.  3 stars for the atmosphere that they are trying to create. A tad pricey.  Can see this being a hang out spot for the very single ready to mingle crowd. One visit might be enough for me!"}
{"text":"This place wasn't as bad as I thought it would be and it was actually quite fun. There are three things that keep it from a four or five star. 1. It is pricey, but it is still packed so maybe they hit the right pricing range like Disneyland. 2. It is fun to golf and be able to watch college or pro football however they have fox and ESPN but no pac-12 network. 3. We came here for an event that was three hours and we were suppose to check in at the event booth and escorted to the event area however we spent 20 minutes waiting and missing our event and ended up just walking and looking for our event! Most of the people at top golf seem like they obviously don't play golf, food and drinks were good, waitresses were friendly and helpful. It is kind of nice the balls are chipped and if you hit it in any of the hole areas it shows up on the screen!"}
{"text":"First time here and we had a great time, many games to chose from and the golf was fun. Had the burgers,  sweet potatoe frys. Food good I think the drink were a little weak. That would be the bad thing."}
{"text":"Bad costumer service. They completely messed up charging us on times && then never asked up for last call. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Brady and Raven were the absolute best! They took great care of us. So accommodating, very knowledge and great to talk to. If I lived here I'd request them every time I came in. Thank you both!!!"}
{"text":"Staff is very rude! Spent over 1000 vip booth for my birthday  \" with bottle service.\" As soon as my 3 hours was up I got hassled to leave. Multiple security guards  came up to me and asked me to leave with half a bottle left. The place was empty and seating was not a problem. The security and management  were very rude and crass.DO NOT RECOMMEND if you want to be treated badly. Worst experience ever!!"}
{"text":"Went here for a last minute team outing for work. We showed up with 20 people on a Thursday evening and were able to get three bays right next to each other. The venue is nice and the staff there were all very friendly. The food and drinks there were a little pricey in my opinion, but it being a tourist place near the strip it is only fitting for the prices to reflect that way. I would definitely recommend going and trying it out."}
{"text":"Had a great time in Vegas!!! Top golf had the one of best service in vegas!!!  Our server Michelle was so awesome .  She made sure everyone in our group had a great time"}
{"text":"Went here straight from the airport, what a great way to start an AZ trip!  Great customer service, immaculate set up and privacy for your group, but still fun/social.  Wish they had more microbrew options, but clean/modern design and great fun on all the games.  I hope they build one in WA soon!"}
{"text":"I hate golf. I hate playing 9 holes and I hate going to the driving range. That being said I love Topgolf! Every time I go it is more fun that the last. I enjoy the food, the drinks and the games. For me its not like golfing it feels more like bowling (but way more entertaining, darts or beer pong even). Its a fun, not overly expensive way to spend an afternoon!"}
{"text":"If you like bowling, then this place is for you. Yes I said bowling. It's hitting golf balls in a triple story driving range bowling style. You have your lane or bay as they call it with your table and chairs just like in the bowling alley. You can get in 2 games in an hour with 2 people if you hustle. If you order food and drink you need an hour and a half. This place is vastly popular and crowded but a whole lot of fun, even if you don't really play golf or are terrible at it. Anyone can do it including kids. We played 3 games in 1.5 hours. They offer 10% off for military but not good on food and drink which is crappy. You don't need to bring your own clubs...they provide for free. After you check in at the front you check in again once your bay is ready. We had a 25 minute wait and waited at the bar. My only grip is food service. Our waitress came over 30 minutes into our game finally. Which is ok but we only wanted to play 1 hour. We had to extend by 30 minutes because by the time food came. .we only had 15 minutes left in the bay to finish playing AND eat. They should've come over immediately. The bay prices go up by time of day.. morning is cheapest. We played mid afternoon and paid $35 for our bay with a gift card and military discount, plus 2 beers at $4.5 each plus cheese fries and chips/guac. Food alone was $22. 30 minute time bay extension was $15 and change
 All in all it was great. Definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"The system that they use is quite flawed, dropped our players on multiple occasions, not too happy about this even though they gave us a free hour it took IT about 10 minutes to fix it. I would Hastily come back to this one, service is super slow, took the bay waitress a while to get take care of our group"}
{"text":"Great facility for parties or groups of friends. The fact that each ball is tracked and displayed on the screen is awesome. It's very similar to bowling alleys that display which pins you hit. My only gripe is that their video system for our bay got very buggy in the beginning when one of the names that was registered stopped showing up. To took them about 7 minutes (of our purchased hour) to get things working again. Then towards the end of our hour their app started slowing down and would take 2-3 minutes each time before being able to dispense a ball which eventually ate into our hour. And they weren't able to extend our time anymore l so we were able to get our money's worth. 

Overall it was a good experience and my family enjoyed it. I'm sure it's an easy fix for them and it probably doesn't happen much. Just disappointed it happened to us. I'd definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas and even throw a party there."}
{"text":"We were on the fourth floor. Beautiful view, super relaxing. Fun. First time with a golf club so no expert BUT as a lay person I had a good time. Merlot was ok as was the pizza. Overall very nice night if you go with at least a couple of friends."}
{"text":"Went during the soft opening days so the food and drinks were free as were the games which obviously made me like it more. That being the case the food was excellent and the bay hostess Jenna was beyond nice and helpful as was the guy working with her (can't recall name). If they continue with that level of service along with the fun games for golfers of all levels this place is going to be a goldmine."}
{"text":"I love it here with grown ups or with kids. You have to be prepared going in, there could be long waits and it gets more expensive at night, but it's so much cooler all lit up. You can have 6 golfers per bay and it's not easy to get two bays together, so if you have a bigger group than 6, it might put a damper on things if it's busy and you have to be separated. But, if you're six or less (golfers, you can have more people just hanging out), it's really fun. Last time we went, we got there around 4 on a Saturday and it was a two hour wait. So I logged on and bought a priority pass and we got right in. That's how I would recommend doing it, get there, see how long the wait is and if it's super long THEN get the priority pass. For example, if you get there and it's only 45 minutes, to me that's not worth the $50. They have a bar, so you can hang out there and get drinks, the wait goes by pretty quick, especially with all the activity around you in the bar area. The food is a huge step up from Dave and Busters (our other go to with the kids). We did the mushi (like southwest \"sushi\" rolls), some salads (decent), and the kids love the chicken strips. The tots are good but, I mean, they're tots so I don't really get the review I read raving about them. They have these avocado eggrolls that are bomb. Get those for sure. Oh, and your golf experience doesn't matter, all levels will have fun."}
{"text":"Cool place to kill a day a little pricey especially if you drink but a fun place to launch a golf ball and chill by the pool with a giant tv too watch sporting events."}
{"text":"Always a good time at Top Golf! Always worth the wait. The food and drinks are always awesome and the overall experience is so much fun!"}
{"text":"Our server Alicia was fantastic and friendly.   We came to celebrate a birthday for a friend and had excellent food.   The fried chicken sandwich is delicious!! At ye end of the night our machine froze up and Michelle came to help us and was so helpful.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I enjoyed all the glory of Topgolf on a company outing, so I can't really speak to the process of making a group reservation, menu planning, etc. Our group of 14+ was greeted at the door and escorted to our reserved space pretty much right away, lucky us! I recommend booking in advance if you can....there was a sizable line at the entrance. Clearly, this place is popular!
Anyone can play Topgolf, from aspiring pros to those who've never held a gold club. All you had to do is try! It's likely you'll have a great time. It's basically a driving range, full service bar/pub and arcade all in one! You might never want to leave. It's pretty addicting and I think I scored a grand total of 18 points. The food was pretty darned good too. Bites and sips are similar to what you'd find at a gastropub. We snacked on shareables like guacamole, queso and shrimp. For those that opt out from the golf game...there's plenty of seating to kick back and relax. I'll be back! But can you please open a Topgolf in Tucson? I'll even settle for Marana :)"}
{"text":"I think it's a little expensive, especially since I suck at golfing but it is fun. I still enjoy it even though I'm not that great, and I think that's what is so great about it is you don't have to be a pro at golfing to have fun here."}
{"text":"Couldn't have asked for anything better. Great for golfers and non golfers alike. Wish they had something like this when i was in highschool."}
{"text":"Herein arrives the latest evolution in the golf industry, and an important one to keep the sport relevant and accessible in today's market.  Topgolf's a highly glorified driving range with electric targets that respond to special balls that power a wide variety of games easy to pick up for the most casual person (and each bay has a selection of a driver, about three irons, and a wedge).  Add to it cocktails, pub food, TVs, sports book window, and pop music the way only Vegas can and you have the gist of what the place is about.

For the avid or even mildly experienced golfer, it can feel kinda like golf dumbed down, and the knowledge of the staff here (and from what I've heard at other locations) doesn't seem to match the premium they charge to play here, aside from the fact that they do really try to encourage the patrons to spend on F&B.  Surprised that there's no putting component at their centers.

I pre-purchased a membership prior to arrival, only to find they couldn't bring it up when I was assigned to a bay (they probably should've had a longer soft open period prior to \"official\" launch) so my scores which should be logged to my membership were not.  I also wasn't given a physical card even though their website said I'd be given one upon arrival.  All things that are discouraging if you're going to be paying a premium to play

The place is rather costly (cheapest hourly rate is $30 on Mon-Thurs. before noon, rates are higher later in day and for the upper floor bays) to be one's local regular driving range.  It is a quite novel attraction that is likely to attract casual visitors from out of town looking for a fun way to spend and hour or two

Hope this place improves over time, as it is essentially the company's flagship location.  Novel and fun, but perhaps too costly and trendy to be an avid golfer's regular range.

(P.S. parking onsite is valet only (comped at time of review), self park must use MGM garage and walk pathway past MGM pools to get to center, which may become an annoyance once the MGM parking fees go into effect)."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that I have to give a 2 star review because for the most part it was a great experience considering this was all My only complaint is with the customer service from a sales rep. I called on April 8 to check pricing for premier reservations for later that night and was told that the sales rep would give me a call back. I received a call but unfortunately I couldn't understand his name. The over the phone experience wasn't the issue. He explained that there was $100 fee per hour and a 2 drink minimum per person. I told him have a group of 6 people. He followed up with saying that everything would be a total of $330. I asked by repeating \"so everything is gonna be a total of $330,\" to just make sure. He then said yes. So I went ahead and booked a reservation for later that night. When we arrived I went to the private event desk and told the person that was helping us that we had an appointment. He looked it up and then told me it was $100 per hour. He then said that the drink and food minimum would be $330. I was surprised, so I asked for clarification. He repeated the prices. I then was trying say that the guy I talked to on the phone told me everything was $330 before he interrupted me and said, \"well that was me and I didn't say that,\" with rude tone. So I looked at my family who I was with and discussed it with them. My uncle asked how much it was if we just waited for the 3rd floor without a reservation. He told us the prices and we finally decided to do that. So I looked back at the rep and told him we were just going to do the normal rates for the 3rd floor. He then just crumbled up our reservation info and didn't even acknowledge me. This one sales rep left a bad impression of this location.

Even with the bad start, we eventually had a great time. Their was giant monitors, few Cornhole setups, a couple of shuffle boards, and of course a bar in the waiting area while we waited. Then another employee showed us up to our bay, explained the rules and how everything works, along with where things were. The customer service from the employee that showed us our bay and the waitress were excellent. Although it was a little pricey for everything, we thought it was well worth the experience. We look forward to trying Topgolf again although we might consider going to another location which is inconvenient because we live in southern California and this is probably the closest one. If not for one employee's unprofessional behavior, this could have easily been a 5 star review."}
{"text":"Such a great addition to the Charlotte area!  When I think of a driving range, I think of a slightly dingy place where you bring a couple of clubs, grab a basket of balls, and hit about an hours worth of shots off an open tee.  This is definitely NOT this place.

Top Golf is really best for groups, especially non-golfers.  They have a full set of both Women's and Men's clubs, so you don't have to bring your own if you don't want to.  I would say the more competitive groups had their own clubs, and the ones just playing for fun did not.  We were there for my boyfriend's birthday, so we had a group of all skill levels.  We chose to play the game where you just try to hit as close to the center of the target as possible (the further you hit it, and the closer to the center of the target you get, the more points they give you).  Great because you can score a lot of points hitting the center of a close target for those of us who are terrible at golf!  They also have regular games, scrambles, etc.  Something for everyone!  Form what I understand, all of the balls have RFID so it will show you where your ball landed on a screen.

I just need to knock this place for the food service.  It took almost TWO HOURS to get food, and we had to extend our time an extra hour (which they felt bad about us doing), but they were great in their response on fixing the situation.  Our waitress was certainly available when we needed her, and hopefully next time I go, the food will come out quicker.

Just a warning, it gets windy on the third level (where I was playing), so hold onto your drinks!  Overall, I had a fantastic time and I highly recommend this place if you go early.  We waited an hour on a Monday night, which was just enough time to hang out and have a drink at the bar.  I have to say my favorite part of the night was when it got dark, the targets on the range lit up, and flickered to the beat of the techno music.  Fun time and I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awful, and I mean awful. We came here with a party of 12 people and had a table with golf booked. We sat downstairs and started drinking their overly expensive drinks right away (their bucket of beers is beer in CANS, talk about classy). And this was maybe the only acceptable part of the night as the downstairs area had corn hole and tvs and seats available. 

They called us to our golf place upstairs so we started to walk there and sat down, deciding who would be playing the top golf. During this time we ordered the overly expensive food and drinks, like drinks just for 6 people alone were $100+ a round. After we ordered we had someone come up to us and tell us that we needed to purchase another table/golf area because we had more than 6 people?! Um yeah we had 6 people total who wanted to play, the rest of us were just hanging out and drinking.... and on top of that they kept saying it was a fire hazard, but the table next to us had 3 people there and they didn't care and said we could be a part of their group. So we had to have 2 people go inside to the bar because only 10 people were allowed at the hitting cage, so it sucked because we paid to be split up from the rest of our group! And the worst part was the group next to us was ok with us standing there and the cage to the other side was empty.

Don't go here, they nickel and dime you and the food is average at best, the drinks are beyond expensive and the service sucks."}
{"text":"Came to Topgolf with my husband for my birthday week. I had a great time.  The place looks nice, bright lights, nice bar clean restrooms.  The staff is super nice Estefania and our 2 other waitresses made us feel welcomed. The drinks and food was delicious. We had fun. We would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Watch your bill. We had a group of 6 there today and dropped over $500. We asked how much time we had left to play golf and we were lied to about the time. Next thing you know they want another $100 from us. When we told the lady that we asked and were told we had more time left on what we paid by the guy standing next to her she said sorry this is your bill. The employee that lied to us was like sorry. Total used car tactics to get more money out of you. Fun place but the staff just wants to rip you off. Will never go back because of this this."}
{"text":"Can be pricey but was really fun. Yummy appetizers... deviled eggs and chicken wings. Great service and comfortable golf bay."}
{"text":"Fun place!  Golf for All skill levels!! Great food, cold drinks!! Friendly & helpful staff !! Fun for large groups!!  Must try!!"}
{"text":"love this place . first time here gotta ask for jewell best server ever first floor got a ceaser salad with steak jewell recommended witch was awesome !! i will come back !"}
{"text":"Fun, relaxing, drinks, food, games and a gorgeous view!! Try a Bloody Mary and add your own toppings!"}
{"text":"Great entertainment spot! Whether you're a beginner or advanced golfer, Topgolf is fun. There's a lot of different games you can play and time goes by so quickly you don't even realize you've been playing for hours... until your time is up and you have to add more.  We've played during the day and at night and both are a little different but equally fun. During the day you can see the targets easier and watch your ball, but at night the lights really make it a inquire experience."}
{"text":"Topgolf is a great place and cool concept. It has different levels with driving range concept style on each floor. On the top floor, there is a pool and even private mini pools if you have them reserved.

There is also bars, small games like beer pong, life size jenga, and hacky sacks. At the bars, there are video poker and video black jack games of course."}
{"text":"Everything is awesome but my time definitely kept expiring before 1 hour mark that we would pay for. People next to us said the same thing. Food is awesome though"}
{"text":"Fun spot to go hangout, however each spot only allow up to 6 golfers so you'd have to share the same account and score with a friend if you have more people. There's couple side games you can play too while waiting and plenty of big screen TVs playing sports at all time. 
The food is amazing here! The must must try is the donut holes with chocolate and cream fillings!!"}
{"text":"We came on a Sat around 6 but beware of the wait. My group and I waited 2 hours just to find out that we were pushed back another 3-4 hrs because people kept renewing their play. There should be a limit or whatever so that everyone that comes here get to experience it. The wait for level 3&4 was about 5 freaking hours! Crazy. Have a better system so that other people actually get to play. Other than that, scenery is nice, workers are friendly and food is good but thanks for wasting our time."}
{"text":"I had a departmental team building event recently where catering, adult beverages and a smaller group played. The process was very easy, the staff that I coordinated with via email and in person were all very helpful. I will say that I was slightly disappointed with the food package we had ordered. We thought it would be best to have the food ready in advance but for a group of 12, I should have let everyone order what they wanted. Larger groups, I would definitely recommend pre-ordering but they should come up with better food packages. The game itself I am at a disadvantage because my hand-eye coordination is terrible! I tried and that is what counts, not to mention, I really did have fun. Great for groups, great for team building, highly recommend overall."}
{"text":"Such a fun experience, especially when you're with a group. It's amazing how far technology has come so that you're able to track how far you've hit a golf ball when there are thousands of golf balls already in the field. You pay by the space so the more people you have, they cheaper it'll be per person.

The appetizers were also pretty good so if you're not playing, you can always sit back and have a snack.

The only downside about this place is the wait. I feel like there will always be a 2-3 hour wait no matter when you go. Good thing our hotel was across the street so we just waited til they gave us a call."}
{"text":"Despite the temperatures being 114 out, we had a great time killing an hour trying outdo each other hitting the targets. Our waitress was very attentive and keep the drinks coming and was so sweet to be our cheerleader when we we're hitting the best shots.

I would have gave all five stars but for some weird reason, some of our shots weren't registering.  We couldn't figure out if it was the balls or the just the brown target but shots that clearly went in that target didn't register.  Not a big deal but we were competing for favors so marriage happiness was on the line! LOL!

Can't wait until the Vegas location opens....such a fun experience."}
{"text":"Fun times! The birthday boy wanted to go to Topgolf. Oh geez. 1st time for me but not my last! Truth: in not into golf. I had so much fun despite the long wait & total $$ damage. It was a Saturday night so any happening place has a line. No biggie. We also intentionally waited for the sun to go down hoping for temps to be 100° or lower.  There are strong fans with misters  for each bay. We had the end one so our fan didn't oscillate nor did we have to share it.  Even though the decks are curved, we were still at a disadvantage for the huge lighted scoring holes.  I did mention I don't golf right? Eh. So I had fun trying to wack the ball & not just have it roll of the edge to the other people on the lizard lower decks. Yes, there is a net at the edge for everyone's safety. For me, I compare this to bowling  with friends. Who ever is playing is up there doing his/her own thing. The rest of us are drinking, talking, eating, laughing, & dancing  (DJ on Sat nights! ) on the lounge couch/chairs.  Yes, I suck at bowling too.  I still have fun. Maybe it was the lateness of the night or the partying of the folks in the other closer banks, we rarely saw our waiter. We didn't order as many drinks as wanted or any food to nosh. Also restroom was far considering where we were playing at. 5 stars from me because the concept is awesome.  We had a blast! I'm hoping to have better experience now that I know."}
{"text":"Went in with a group of ten and was great until we noticed the staff hanging around our table. Have you ever experienced an employee following you throughout the store? This is exactly how it was except it was the staff and security. Even when my friend and I went to the restroom, a female employee clearly followed us in, saw us, proceeded to \"wash her hands\", and left right after. Not only that, but we were asked to check for IDs (and only our group when there were other groups next to us) by the security after we showed our IDs to the server when we placed our drinks. I understand checking IDs but if you're going to continuously ask for proof of ID please make sure you do it for EVERY group and not just one group based on how they look."}
{"text":"I love the Top Golf in Denver, so I had to check out the new one in Vegas. We walked in and saw the pricing per hour for the pods. Holy cow, at some points it is $90 per hour. That is absolutely ridiculous.  The fun Top Golf experience is not worth that kind of money of you ask me. We decided to forgo the golf and instead just have a drink and bite at the bar. The beers are not cheap. $8 for a draft beer is a bit high. This is theme park prices. We decided to split the steak skewers with shishito peppers. The steak was well seasoned and sitting in a vinaigrette dressing. Super tender and just the right kick with the peppers. I really like this appetizer. We enjoyed the nice weather and beautiful view, but not sure how often I would come to this location for the high prices."}
{"text":"Pretty fun place.  Had a surprise birthday for my wife's 30th.  Great location and staff! Awesome bar food, and drinks.  Only downside is that the computer system is very confusing and you spend a lot of time registering and standing in multiple lines. They also do not take reservations.  You can buy a line jumper pass, but it was a little inconvenient and expensive."}
{"text":"I had a great time today at Top Golf with my family. However, my experience was only hindered by the staff and business organization of this franchise. 
We were first greeted by a rude and inconsiderate employee who escorted us to our \"bay\". She seemed apathetic towards our experience, explaining that there was \"no way\" to play any other games. She explained to us that as out of state players, we were able not able to have our own team. Because of this, the 6 of us were forced to play on two teams, instead of being all able to compete against each other as desired. Just as we had teed off, we were introduced to our \"Bayhost\", a very impatient waitress. She continually exclaimed HELLO as we were trying to watch our grandma hit the ball, and took no message from the fact that we did not immediately turn around. She explained to NOone the drinks, and left before taking any orders. She returned two minutes later to see if we need anything, and didn't return for the rest our hour an a half stay at Top Golf. 
I would love to return again for this fun family experience when I come back to Arizona, but not until these kinks are knocked out."}
{"text":"Great time with family!  We will definitely go to one of these again.  We were on the third level, and it was a blast!"}
{"text":"TopGolf is pure genius.  I've been to two now and they are busy from the time they open.  $25 an hour for balls and $2 PBR's.  Done and done."}
{"text":"Great service, great ambiance, awesome drinks

Get the Frozen Moscow Mule (not on the menu)!

Great value, $75 bucks for one hr of fun with my 3 compadres.

Take an Uber here, it's really far back into MGM, it's actually not in MGM, it's another building in the back of MGM.

Loads of fun: the golf tech is next level with digital chips in each ball."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Topgolf & I will definitely be back! I loved the atmosphere! It was fun to play (even though Im not good at golf) and the food wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"Great time good food lots of fun make sure to try to Buffalo flatbread it's the best in Arizona"}
{"text":"Been here about 3 times already, definitely enjoyed the food and golfing. I loved the atmosphere and how it's different than other Topgolfs I've been to in other states.

I always order their chicken wings here, the asian sesame one is the best! Food and alcohol are a little pricy but it's pretty much what you would expect in Las Vegas. 

For the price of ordering food, beverage, and paying per hour on the 3rd level I would expect better service. Our game time had already started and we were still waiting for a T and left handed clubs. Waiting on our beverage and food was also slow. It took me 3 times to ask for a glass to actually receive one. 

Also another time we sat at the tables next to the bar to eat and drink on the second level and service was slow. We waited at least 20min for a waiter to come and take our order. Not sure if anyone was paying attention to people sitting down because there were a bunch of workers just standing around. Our party didn't know if they were the waiters we should approach to order. Either way why should a customer have to wave down a waiter? Especially after just getting to sit down at the table.  

I love topgolf but I wish their service was 5 stars because it would make for a much better experience especially at the price we are paying. Management needs to be more organized in training their staff because I feel like they are just standing around not even approaching customers to see if they need anything or have questions. I want to reserve for a party but I hope their service gets better."}
{"text":"Place is fun, golfing is fun. But staff is horible, we try to call to make reservation but nobody was helpful. My friend leave them couple voice mail and they never replied. So don't even try to call them. We just went there and we got a waitress (her name was Asia) she was so rude i guess she was drunk or hangover. After she took orders we got a new waitress her name is Ashton and she is really nice. We were celebrating a birthday and we ask for birthday desert or anything for a birthday (at least just to write happy birthday) they couldn't do it.
We ask for pool on third floor and novody knows what time opens. For such a fancy place they should have better customer service. We all know that Vegas has good customer service but this was kind of disapointing"}
{"text":"Golf was fun. Waitresses jumbling up the bill wasn't. Somehow a $29 bill in my hand turned into a $45 bill after my card was swiped (2 beers and 1/6 of 2.5hrs of Topgolf). Disorganized and obviously 150% more expensive that the original bill states..."}
{"text":"Lots of fun. I was steered here by a friend, and so I brought my two boys on a day that I wanted to get them off of their video game playing behinds.

We rented a stall for 2 hours (because I wanted them out, and there was some withdrawal symptoms from the video games). Started in the morning, so it was only $25/hr. We had a stall right away, didn't have to wait, but as I understand it there is a long wait on the weekends.

The golfing was a lot of fun, and I prefer it to bowling, honestly. Once I got my groove back, I was hitting 200 yard balls. I really need to get my own clubs though.

We had Mushi, which was a mexican twist on sushi, and a queso appetizer dish. Both were excellent! I was really surprised by the quality of the food. It was fancy restaurant good, honestly, and not overpriced. The boys had sodas, which they kept frequently filled. I don't know how it goes when they're busy, but they were definitely on top of it while we were there.

In any case--good entertainment, excellent food, perfect service from our attendant. We were extremely pleased, and will be coming back."}
{"text":"Even if you're not into golf, you can enjoy it here! Do yourself a favor and visit. Prices are a little expensive but that's Vegas. Food and drinks or solid. Atmosphere is great. Wanted to come at night but because of our plans, could only make it here in the afternoon. It was my girlfriend and I and after an hour of play, food and drinks we looked at a bill of $200 with tip and tax."}
{"text":"My first time and so much fun!!! I like the variety of clubs they offer so you're not just hitting driver."}
{"text":"Had a blast with friends! I'll surely take everyone who visits to Top Golf. Awesome customer service and GREAT food/drinks. It's so much fun!"}
{"text":"Parking lot had maybe 30 cars and they said it was a 2 hr wait. All booked up for corporate functions. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Don't understand how Top Golf only has 3 stars!!??? Well I absolutely love it and have enjoyed it every single time I have gone! 

Let's start with the atmosphere that over looks the Las Vegas strip talk about awesome! The different levels, one for adults, one for families, and one for those looking to have lots and lots of fun!!!  Pools, golf, bars, tvs, and games! How could you not have fun. It's basically an adult playground!!!! Booze and good food are always a mix for a blast right??!!! Ok maybe if your boring it's not! :/ 

Food is fantastic as well as service! I feel like it is a little high in price and maybe that's one of the reasons it's only received three starts. But in my opinion it's the place to go for some fun!! And I think it's worth the price depending on the company you are with!"}
{"text":"Fantastic facility, friendly servers. The only reason I give it four stars is because how long it would take to get service. I highly recommend the sweet chili shrimp and the steak skewers."}
{"text":"I went here for a team building event. We got food and played golf for 2 hours. I got the flatbread which was really good. Others got the fried chicken and said it was really flavorful.  

The golfing part was really fun but did have a few bugs where it would send out more than one ball or would take a while to register the ball. 

I would definitely go again. I want to take my dad here soon!"}
{"text":"Pretty much a driving range on steroids. Held my interest for about 15 minutes.  I had a much higher expectation and thought there was virtual golf within the facility."}
{"text":"Great experience! It was super fun. They charge you a $5 membership fee for each new player. They only charge you per bay per hour, which is nice, but if you have too large of a group, you'll need more than an hour. It was my first time \"golfing\" and it was super fun! It was difficult to get the hang of at first because my balls were just flying diagonally but after trying all the clubs, it's kind of fun. There are different clubs for men and women (I assume the clubs for men have a little more weight to them). There are a lot of different games that you can play. I only played TopShot because I wanted to try to aim for accuracy. There are 3 different levels, the level that you check in on where the bar is, is the 2nd level (I thought it was the first). You have to be 21+ to be on the 3rd level and it cost a tad bit more. 

~~Parking: I personally walked here from the MGM, but there is PENTY of parking b/c I've seem most other people walking here or using a rideshare. 

~~Liked: It's a great way to destress and have some fun! 

~~Worst part: The waiting.....I would go around 10 and the wait times would already be 2 - 3 hours (I tried going one day and decided not to wait, but returned the second day and left my number to be texted when the bay would be ready). 

~~Service: Okay. The cashier had said that I would receive a text when my bay is ready and if I ventured off out side that I would be able to text that I'm about 15, 30, or 1 hr away. I was at the MGM and said that I would be arriving in about 15 min, but they texted saying back that I had been placed back on the waitlist. At least the second one was about a 20 min wait in comparison to the 3 hr wait previously. 

~~Tip: Go to the MGM Grand hotel and talk to someone in the lobby @ the TopGolf desk that they have b/c they have a $10 off (which can help pay off your membership fee if you are new) 

~~Return: Yup!"}
{"text":"Really cool place. Great view and the setup is fun. You get your own bay and you can compete and play against your friends. The only reason it's not a 5 star is because of pricing. It's pretty expensive and paying  by the hour makes you want to rush through your game."}
{"text":"The game is awesome fun but quite expensive. The food is more 2 star if that. I will come back to play but never to eat. I'll spend $50 bucks on the game but I won't spend $50 on dinner ever again. I had the crab cake sliders and it wasn't a crab cake. It was crab salad warmed in a microwave. Or at least that is what it tasted like. The nachos were ok but honestly Taco Bell has better and it won't set you back 50 bucks."}
{"text":"Update...This has very quickly gone downhill :(

It's such a great concept and was SO much fun at first but my last few visits have been extremely disappointing. I'll use my last visit to illustrate:

I finally got a chance to bring my dad to Top Golf. I already knew we weren't permitted to use drivers, woods, or hybrids (ridiculous) but we showed up at about 11:15am this day only to be told that as of THAT day, we can only hit our clubs from the first floor. This was a huge let down for me, especially since I had brought my new clubs with me. My dad goes with the flow so he said don't worry about it, the first floor is fine - because of course I wanted to play with my new clubs. So we were sent all the way to the end of the first floor (bay 103 to be exact) where the computers were broken, everything was dusty and dirty, and we got no service. Literally 25 minutes later we still hadn't even sat down, nor could we even get water because there wasn't a server in sight. Thirty minutes later, luckily we finally had a server and the computers were fixed because we had two other people that met us there about 11:45 to play. Our server was overly apologetic and awkward but at least the food was good.

It would have been nice if they had just offered to move us to a different bay? Not sure why they couldn't manage to do that. 

I really wish they would come up with some kind of system where everyone has the opportunity to play with their FULL set of clubs and if you hit it over the fence once, that's it - you're out. I understand life isn't fair and they are \"fixing the fence\" or whatever but it would be so much more fun if we could use all of our clubs, on all of the levels, especially the girls! My boyfriend and I were planning on doing the Monday night tournament together but after this last visit we definitely changed our minds.

If I come back, it will probably only be for the nachos."}
{"text":"My first top golf experience was a hole in one!  Great food.. brunch was exceptional!  Why oh why isn't there a location in San Diego??"}
{"text":"What a BLAST!  Top Golf is a three-story driving range that really delivers the ultimate family-friendly golf experience.  Each bay has its own \"hang out\" space complete with a table and chairs or a couch and coffee table.  The space is also climate-controlled with space heaters when it's chilly and misters when it's hot.  The food and service are terrific!  A shout out to BAMBI for the excellent service on our last visit!  After a few months of visiting Top Golf weekly, my husband purchased the platinum membership.  We love it there THAT MUCH."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this, I have been to TopGolf before in Virginia. And I enjoyed myself.  This Charlotte location is something else. I don't know if it's bc it's new or what. ITS VERY UNORGANIZED, UNDERSTAFF, UNTRAINED STAFF AND DID I SAY UNORGANIZED??!!!!!!!
I can understand the wait for the bay (to Golf) but I can not understand the 15 mins wait for the waitress to even come to the table , 15 to even get your drinks, 1 hour for your food. And on TOP that I told waitress i was vegetarian SO WHY DID SHE LET  ME ORDER SOMETHING WITH MEAT!! ...That's part of the untrained STAFF. I told her I wanted to change my order to a veggie burger and then she came BACK TO THE TABLE 20 MINUTES LATER AND SAID SO YOU WANT ME TO PUT A VEGGIE IN FOR YOU? And I said so you did not already but it in? Also employees that was delivering the food keep going to different table asking the guest \"is this your food\"! They did not even know what tables order what !! 

By the way the Veggie Burger is really good!!  
THE NEED SOME SERIOUS HELP HERE!!"}
{"text":"YOU MUST GO!!! YES GO!! So worth it! Staff is super awesome, very attentive! Love the atmosphere! Reasonably priced, super fun, good for families or even just hanging out with friends!!"}
{"text":"I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH A COOL PLACE!! We are from California and this blew us away!! FOOD WAS AMAZING!!! Great service too!! Only reason I am not giving a 5 star is because we had 9 people and they sat us at a table for 6.  We had to stand and eat and there was barely any room."}
{"text":"We love top golf. We recently went to the one in Las Vegas.  it's like a million times bigger a million times better obviously.
But we came here today on a Sunday afternoon at 3 o'clock. Literally a five minute wait until we could get a bay we're a family of four so it's pretty awesome.
seriously you can't beat $35 for one hour of top
Golf. I feel like that's pretty reasonable and being that they go by the hour not by the person.
Also the food here is pretty awesome we enjoyed the chips with queso. 
The staff who works out in your bay happens to be a lot  more friendlier and have better customer service than the people on your front desk and your customer service center. 
We definitely will be coming to this location and time and time again
Nothing but a great Sunday afternoon with my family and shooting some golf balls"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and food is not bad for the setting. Definitely a change from bowling and drinks."}
{"text":"Had such an amazing time last night. Friendly and attentive staff made sure our every need was met last night, amazing food and vibes at this place."}
{"text":"Second time here will never come again bc of the bartending service that is well below average. Beth was an absolute bitch. She was probably having a bad day but you never treat customers that way I'm done."}
{"text":"Great night out until our server tried to ring us out.  Took 30 minutes to fix the mistake he made by charging one golf the cards rather than splitting the total between the three credit cards.  What a major buzz kill!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place.  I'll probably do this twice a year and do a guys night.  Like someone mentioned, one ball at a time, takes time for the points to register, the hour can go quick.  The matts you hit off are pretty worn down and hard to hit off of.  The way the points are calculated is always a guessing game, it's really inaccurate.  You can basically find one hole and fixate on that one the entire time if you want to win.  I'd recommend doing 5 balls at each hole and turn it into a competition.  

The layout of this place is a C grade, it can get really congested.  Lines go out the door, if you want to get to the bar or to the tee boxes, you have to worm your way through.  It's confusing about what line to get into even though there's people to help out.  The bar is great, though it should have been more detached from the entrance IMO.  Drinks are very expensive, mixed drinks are tiny.  

Our host was awesome though, Brock.  We came in a party so our 3 lanes were reserved, he was very pleasant.  I hope when I go back it's a guys night and it's more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place. We were supposed to go to an event and could not get any parking on site. Valet parking was full. Very disorganized and very chaotic. We went up missing the event. Shame on them for not having better organization for a facility the size"}
{"text":"Fun place to play golf with friends and family. They also  have two pool tables and awesome drinks. The only bad thing about this place is the wait time. We went Saturday evening and was told there was a 2 and half hour wait time."}
{"text":"Great time was had by all. First time there enjoying my birthday. Service was great, taco tray was perfect. Tacos were delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great fun for the entire family. Food has been spot on. Kiddos love the pizza. But, if you are at the bar or just sitting to eat, waiting on staff is a bit too long. This is our new fav!!"}
{"text":"Top Golf is absolutely amazing and the service I received was tremendous. While booking a event for my company I had the pleasure of working with Jordan the event planner. He was great and very patient with me on my decision making. He allowed me to come twice to review the location and also experience what my team would experience. 
I also had the opportunity to work with Steven for our corporate platinum membership which my company is EXTREMELY thrilled to be apart of. Being able to allow our clients to enjoy a nice day of golfing and networking are two wins! 

The food I really good! Be sure to try the donut holes which are addictive and fries! I had a Moscow Mule and to all my Moscow peeps be sure to get one, so good! 

We are thrilled to be apart of what will be the hottest place in Charlotte. Thank you top golf and everyone that has made my experience superb!"}
{"text":"Top Golf is one of the coolest outdoor activities in Phoenix! The atmosphere is chill and the service is great. There are staff members floating around making sure you have a superb golfing experience. I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Plenty of people have already rated the overall experience here so I'm going to focus on the food and drinks- and the food is about what you'd expect- typical bar food. My friends and I ordered cheese fries and pretzel dippers while waiting for a bay. Both were good.

The three stars really is because of the drinks. I ordered a pineapple punch and my friend ordered a citrus cabana. The menu says they are sized for 2+ people each, yet there was little to no alcohol in the drink. My friend confirmed that there was almost no alcohol in hers either. You do get the souvenir light up cup that it comes in, but at $16 a pop I was disappointed. I would come back to Topgolf but skip the drinks."}
{"text":"Top Golf is super fun! Loved it! Great vibe and good drinks. There is tons of parking. Tons of games to play while you wait for your spot. The food was ok that is really the only thing that they could improve!

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Topgolf is the premiere daytime experience to be available on the strip. 

Located next to the MGM, this expansive campus is a great place to come hang out with a group for a couple hours. Offering a wide variety of activities besides the  driving range such as six way beer pong, ping pong, sack toss, basketball hoop game and the pool on the 3rd floor. 

They charged us a flat $75 per hour to rent one of the bays (prices vary weekday and weekends) where you can order great cocktails and eat from a wide menu. The price point is reasonable for Vegas standards. 

I highly recommend this place if you want to spend a couple hours of fun in one spot and not go shopping."}
{"text":"I had Veronica M as a host and she was the best. Everything was so awesome, the view the atmosphere, the food is great! It's such a fun spot! Relax by the pool, play some corn hole, sit at the bar or play some golf!"}
{"text":"I love topgolf- but I'm afraid they were watering down our drinks we ordered! Don't know if this is a standard topgolf thing or a new installment. Service is great- staff is very attentive to golf maintenance/game play, and great about food and drink service. My mom and I ordered two of their specialty cocktails and they were flavorless and probably watered down. I won't waste my money on drinks next time!"}
{"text":"IF you get a server named Austin... RUN. He is absolutely terrible. We've had him twice and both times he has forgotten orders at our table, charged us for drink orders that we didn't order, forgot drinks, ETC. He tried to get us kicked out and was a complete A-HOLE to us about ordering drinks at the table. I get if you aren't able to do something, but be polite about it - don't act like a snotty child. We haven't been back in over a month because of the awful experience we had last time. It's a shame because we really enjoyed this place and spent a whole lot of money on golf/food/drinks each time we came in. 

The only reason this place isn't getting one star is because of the food. As far as what's good, the banh-mi is amazing, my favorite thing on the menu. The queso dip is excellent but the salsa is a bit bland for what you pay. Turkey and avocado wrap is great and both the fries and tator tots are excellent. Flatbreads are good as well :) All the food items are pretty solid if you can't tell! 

We love this place and would love to come back but they need to hire better help. It really determines how the entire night is going to go. We all pay a lot of money to come here, make the experience enjoyable. PLEASE."}
{"text":"I rate top golf a 4 out of 5 stars. We went there with a group of people and we had a two hour wait so we played the outdoor games by the bar/dj. It was Saturday night and it was packed. When it was time for us to golf and grab our spot the server came right over but could of been a little more attentive. We were charged a 1$ more for a margarita on the rocks, weird.. But it was a good evening and a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Such a great place to have a good time. Anarbol Martinez totally hooked us up with a bay towards the center on the third floor on a Saturday night where the wait was set to 45 minutes to get a spot on either the third or second floor. Now that's what I call customer service! He's the best!"}
{"text":"Prices are pretty decent, if you go with a couple friends and split the bay rental between all of you.  Food and drink are topnotch too."}
{"text":"Got to love Vegas Top Golf chilled spot atmosphere drinks and being able to tee off with a few in you real fun."}
{"text":"Always a good time at TopGolf. Great food, great drinks, and great staff. We are here pretty regularly. The nachos are great, and the Mac Daddy burger is pretty awesome too."}
{"text":"I visited this location for my first Top Golf experience while I was in Vegas last month. I had an absolute blast! It was 60 bucks for our pit for the hour, we ordered drinks, appetizers and lunch. The drinks were decently priced for Vegas. 
We had the edamame and hot wings for an appetizer and margarita flatbread for lunch. Everything was so yummy! 
Great service from our waitress and all of the staff. 
It has its own uber pickup location so it's easy to get to. 
I definitely recommend stopping here on your vacation! So fun!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! The golf range is a lot of fun, my husband had a great time! However, they were having technical difficulties, that pretended us from finishing our game, but the waitresses was nice enough to give us our money back. I know once they are up and running for a while, they won't have as many technical difficulties. But after that happened we enjoyed a few drinks at the bar and ordered their spinach flat bread and their tater totes with ranch! They have really good ranch btw LOL."}
{"text":"Wow.  I can't believe how poorly this place is run.   We waited for over an hour and easily at least a third of the bays were empty the entire time.  They claim that after you put your name on a list, when there is a bay available, they send a text to the party and give 15 minutes to respond.   What kind of business model is that?!!!   Can you imagine a restaurant doing that?  We left disappointed and respectfully told them they could take our name off the list, even though obviously most people put their name on the list and bolt.  The staff was pretty rude and did not care that obviously money is being lost left and right,  except for one waitress who tried to find me a 'real' manager but never succeeded"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Sure it's a driving range but so much more. It may be a little pricey to just go and practice your swing, but for an afternoon or evening with friends it has all the ingredients for a good time. The hitting bays have sofas so you can sit in comfort until you pick up a club.  Four massive Jumbotrons at the end of the fairway so you can watch multiple games. Cocktail servers and a pretty good menu. There is also a lounge with plenty of TVs if you just want to hang out. It has it's own parking right off of Koval so you don't have to mess with MGM parking."}
{"text":"Tons of fun!!!!!! 90 minute wait only means you can go to the bar and have a drink. 4th floor was great. Jason was awesome very welcoming. Wife and I just relaxed before getting our text that our booth was ready. 

The only issue I had was the shuttle back to MGM. The guy was blasting loud rap music with curse words. Very unprofessional. 

We will however be back."}
{"text":"I recently came to Topgolf after an invite from a work friend. I have heard lots about it, but never have been to any location. I will break it down as best I can, but this is again coming from a weekend night, Friday, around 7:30pm. So take anything I say with this in mind...
Location: I went to the Gilbert location located off Higley. It's big, beautiful, and easily spotted by the giant net. It's also conveniently located right next to the big entertainment place that has bowling and etc. 
Inside Service: Now this is where things get really out of control. There was nobody in the front to help you. We didn't know you had to initially sign up for a Players Card, which is a $5 dollar charge. Then you have to sign in and wait for your name or phone to be texted so you can get a lane. You can try to reserve online, but there's a fee that isn't included in the price. Otherwise inside the bar it's first come first serve. This can get pretty out of control, we had to try and flag someone down. It seemed as if nobody really knew what was happening.
Lane: Obviously this is their bread and butter. The lanes are really well maintained, and I love the variety of games they offer. The clubs were in great condition, and the TV's were a really nice touch. I like how they also had AD's on the game screen. Makes sense I guess.
Food: I was honestly shocked by how well the food was prepared and served. We ordered a bunch of different apps, and it was well worth it. I think they should reduce prices slightly since the price per hour on the lanes can be steep. Regardless, you have to try the different food items, hopefully if we come back we will get an entrée.
Pricing: This is where things can add up fast. Obviously there is a hourly charge. This varies depending on the day and time, with the weekend charges almost doubling the weekday. I understand there is a business and money is to be had, but man... $45 a hour, so if you do come, bring a group so you don't pay as much. Otherwise, I will be only going during the weekdays from now on. 

Overall: I think this place is great if you have the funds to come over and over again. It's nice to have a relaxing golf range that isn't all about pro's. I really enjoyed the food, atmosphere, and the friends we were with. I think we will only go during the day from now on, but this is personal preference. You do have to go at night though, the lights on the lanes are something really fun."}
{"text":"Customer service is THE single most important thing for any business and tonight our service was shit. We were at Bay 109 (8:30-9:30) There was a mistake with our check and we were charged for extra time. Our server was trying to rush us out of that space (I get it, they want their money) but she had to fix our check and I guess it took too long for her and she brought some guy over (manager?) who was rude. He asked \"You got everything figured out?!\" and I asked him what figured out? He said, \"I don't know but we need you guys out cause we have another group coming\" (as the other people sat) We asked for a box for our food that we ordered and they couldn't waste time so that all got thrown away. That guy was an assclown."}
{"text":"This is a very popular \"driving range\" that turns the fun into a game and dinner all in one experience.  Unfortunately, it is so packed that you will likely have to wait several hours to get a spot on the range and you will pay a pretty penny to do so after adding up all their miscellaneous fees, food, tax, and tip for a family of 4.  I would suggest separating the golfing and the eating/drinking into separate events instead of trying to combine the two at Top Golf."}
{"text":"If you have not joined Top Golf.....why not!

We went to the soft opening today and we could not have had a better time.  

Having been to the Houston location I was already familiar with the layout.  Imagine a high class, yet comfortably non-snobby, driving range with cabana like personal bays inside an enormous club/restaurant.  The food and cocktails are destination worthy on their own (you have to try the donut holes that come with injectable sauces.)  And everyone from age 5 to 85 can participate.  (I don't even play golf and yet I couldn't help but play a game....and I won!)  There are also pool tables and video games etc for those that prefer to wander around.  And I cannot speak highly enough of the service level; their staff is groomed to perfection.

Whether you want a family day, a night out with friends, or a team building event for work, you cannot help but have a fantastic experience."}
{"text":"So. Much. Fun. This is Cosmic bowling on steroids! Great business model, great idea. Wish I thought of it."}
{"text":"We visited topgolf for the first time this past sunday and it is such a great fun concept. There is no need to know how to play golf. If you can hit it there is a good chance to score. The staff is very friendly, helpful and attentive. The food was good. Drinks were good. The seating area was said to fit up to 10 but we only had 5 people and were cramped. If one person wasnt hitting then someone was always standing. The price is also very very high. We went there on a sunday at noon and the price was $75 an hour and thats excluding the food and drinks. We are locals and this place is great but I honestly cant see us attending much because it is un affordable."}
{"text":"This place was great.  Great service, fun atmosphere, and the food was incredible.  Marla at the front desk was especially helpful in her customer service.   I would recommend this place to locals and tourists.  The establishment was clean and isn't too far from the MGM Grand.  I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"The owners of these places struck it rich. This place is a gold mine. We went here for some day drinking fun and fun is exactly what we had. Two people in our group were actually golfers who go out religiously every weekend and the other two of us have never golfed (besides mini) in our lives. We all had a blast. Goodbye to the days of bowling for dates and group outings hello the new era of topgolf. You can bring your own clubs or just use theirs. No renting gross shoes or being stuck indoors. This is a great place to hang with friends, family or even go for date night. Food is good as well and drinks were on point. Staff was busy but attentive and prompt. No negative feedback from this top golfer!"}
{"text":"Great place to have fun and at the same time play some indoor golf. The food menu is extensive and has a lot of items for all ages. I've seen people come here and just eat instead of playing golf. :-P
The pricing is competitive and every penny of yours is worth it."}
{"text":"This location of TG is about a block off of the central strip in Las Vegas. It features three main levels, a forth floor for events, and a glass bottom pool. 

Pros: TG golf is a playground for avid golfers, but a fun hangout for those who are not. It offers large and heated suites for putting, with games and equipment provided. If not interested in golfing it offers spacious and multiple seating areas with big screens showing worldwide sports. There is also a menu with drinks, apps, and dinner options. 

Cons: while daytime slots are easy to come by, the wait for evening can be quite long. Additionally, do not expect this to be a serious range. The clubs are weak and the balls have chips. In them, which impact how they fly. Also, expect to pay a membership fee to play in addition to range fees."}
{"text":"Topgolf really isn't for me but truly an impressive entertainment hub. Golf, Food, Drinks and fun all under one roof. If you want to have a good time and hit some balls this place is for you. If you're decent at golf this place will more than likely bore you to death. If you're an experienced golfer bring a 5-6-7 PW you will be all set."}
{"text":"I am rating this place purely in the golfing because the food and drinks are bar options. It meets the standard. However, I don't understand why every time you go here they tell you it's a 2 hour wait. I have attempted to go here multiple times to see at least 10 bays open but a magical \"2 hour wait\" this is completely absurd. And none of the staff can answer why the bays are open. I've been to other Top Golfs and have never had this experience. Charlotte needs to get it together if I'm ever going to return to this location. Seems like a stupid ploy to get money from people at the bar. Once you actually get to golf the experience is fun. That's only if you'll sit around for 2 hours. I avisited at 4pm on a Friday, I'd hate to see what the wait was like during \"prime time\""}
{"text":"OMG SO like this place is bomb. Genius concept. It's like bowling mixed with Golf. Great food and drinks. I recommend taking the server's recommendation on most popular drinks. Also the sweet potato fries are great! 

I came here like 3 times in a row. Not expensive at all when you go with friends.
I wish PA had something like this. I would go all the times with friends."}
{"text":"Our first time to Topgolf was last night and we were given a 3.5 hour estimated wait time. Not a big deal since we anticipated it (Saturday night). Dinner came next at a nearby restaurant and as soon as we were done with our dinner, we got the text that our golfing bay was ready, ahead of schedule. Hooray! Had a ton of fun! Somehow our debit card was left behind and we got a super nice call from the manager letting us know that it was being kept safe. We returned again tonight to retrieve it, and decided to play some more golf. We had a 30-60 minute wait which ended up being 7 minutes. We invited a bunch of friends and ended up renting out 2 golfing bays. We had a super great time for what ended up being several hours, and a freakin awesome server, Jeremy! He was super personable and on top of our orders, despite them being so scattered (sorry!). Our food and drinks were on point and came in a super timely manner. Top notch customer service tonight. Definitely will be returning. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing. I spend countless hours here while I'm on a business trip and the service is amazing the facility is amazing and they have a onsite director of instruction who gives lessons. His name is Jesse Hughes and he told me that he gives lessons and I told him I was flying out soon but thank you. He offered to look at my swing (I was struggling lol) Then gave me a a short lesson no questions asked no offer of services. Fixed my swing in minutes. If this guy does this for you Tip him! His lessons are $115.00 an hour and will come back to visit him next time. Fun weekend thank you Top Golf and thank you Jesse!"}
{"text":"A little pricy since it's a tourist magnetic but great place to spend time with friends and family. Beautiful views and great customer service. The technology for this range is amazing compared to all of the other ranges I've been to in the city. Will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Top Golf is definitely a hot spot in Las Vegas. I recently went here with a large group. From the food to drinks to the game, it was all fun for everyone. I'm not even a golfer and I had fun too. 

Getting to Top Golf was super easy. The group I was with took the monorail, which dropped us off at the MGM and then we took a 10-minute? walk from the casino. 

For a Wednesday night,? it was rather busy. The backdrop of the Las Vegas strip while you are golfing is a nice addition too."}
{"text":"Aaaaamazing! This is 4 levels of fabulous.
Golf, food, sports and sports betting, gaming at bars, 2 pools and live music. 
This is going to be a place I come to often. Staff super friendly too!"}
{"text":"Unless you plan on golfing, I would avoid it here. We're locals and have been several times. This time we had to stay downstairs because we had a baby. No point in golfing without the view from upstairs. So we decided to stick around and have lunch. Unfortunately a big mistake. 

Service was friendly. Food on the other hand was overwhelmingly mediocre. Typically we're golfing and drinking so the food has been an afterthought. Everything was extremely overpriced, even given the location. 

Jalapeño Cornbread Muffins were oddly dry. Couldn't peel them off of the roof of my mouth. House-Marinated Steak Skewers were average. Where were all of the shishito peppers like in the pic?? So generous with all 4 peppers. They've created a great atmosphere there, but serving food like that will certainly make us think twice before venturing over again."}
{"text":"Had an awesome first time at AZ Top Golf. Big shoutout to Kat our server and Michelle her manager, who kept us very happy with food and drink while a swarm of different events were going on from Make a Wish In-progress to World Series Game 1. We had a minor glitch w one appetizer, but they did everything to make it right and then some! You can definitely trust the staff to take care of you. Would absolutely come back, and makes me wish Top Golf would come to the SF Bay Area!"}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun!!!

It is also one of the biggest entertainment bargains in the city.

Range prices vary a little based on the time of day but they are very reasonable.

Food and beverages are not only tasty but the prices are very reasonable and in line with most casual restaurants around town. the pickle fries are so addictive and we always get a flatbread to share, and draft beers are $4 -$6 bucks

The place is run by real pro's because everyone knows how to take care of you, from getting signed in or learning how to play a game or bringing your drinks promptly with a big smile.

You don't have to be a golfer to have a great time, and I recommend The top 2 levels for that unique driving range experience."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Got here and greeted promptly, was placed in a bay quickly, and the servers who took our orders were tentative!
I was expecting \"bar food\" but to my surprise the food was great! We had the Sunshine burger and tots. The burger was so yummy and the tots, not greasy, and they served it with some sauce that was tasty.
Great place for some fun!"}
{"text":"Wevreally have fun here.  Its a long wait, but its worth it.  Thry have grest food.  If you haven't been you missoling out!"}
{"text":"Such a fun place!! I am not an avid golfer but this place is awesome, especially with a group of people to golf, eat & drink. We came this Sunday at 10AM for brunch with 6 people & it wasn't crowded at all, service was good, beers were $3 ea, & we got the queso which was yummy. The only reason I didn't give 5 starts is it is a bit pricey per hour of golfing, it can get up to $45/hour depending on when you go. That's why I always go with a group so you can split it a few ways."}
{"text":"Extremely courteous staff. Clearly a result of excellent management. Delicious food and tasty beer available. Easy system to use for all ages. We had ages 3 through 30 and all had a great time. Came back the next day to enjoy a few more hours before heading back home to San Diego. 

A complaint I see often on here is the machine not scoring properly... 

If the machine does not score your hit properly you can \"move the ball\" to where it should have been. It only happened once to me and this was an easy fix.

This place gets an easy 5 stars from our group. We had so much fun here and we definitely plan on coming back when we visit Gilbert again!"}
{"text":"Such a fun time once we FINALLY got seated. They told us it would be a 1.5 hr wait and it was over 3 hours before we were given a booth. No one apologized, no one cared. We were never compensated for our lost time (which I generally don't look for but in this case they had wasted so much of our day and money running up a bar/food tab waiting that I figured they would do SOMETHING?) very frustrating experience, this location really needs to get their act together.


For reference- we arrived at 4:30pm on a Thursday."}
{"text":"SHORT REVIEW:
Here's the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. 

THE GOOD:  TopGolf has made the driving range a lot more fun.  Pounding ball after ball at your local municipal course drags, especially when your ball slices to the right or hooks to the left.  Here at TopGolf, all those worries are gone. You can enjoy a day or night at this range sipping on a few drinks, grubbing on some food, and watching the big game all at the same time.  

THE BAD:  There's not much that I would complain about.  But if I had to pick, then it would be the parking.  You can either walk here or valet.  Self-parking would be a great addition.  TopGolf is also missing a putting green. 

THE UGLY:  My golf game.  I am really bad at this.  But you know what they say...a bad day at golf is better than a good day at work. 


LONG REVIEW:
One thing about individual sports is finding a fun way to practice it.  Bowlers have Cosmic Bowling.  Pool players have the local bar.  Dart players have Cricket. But what about the people that enjoy golf? All they have is miniature golf and that really doesn't count.  Putting a red golf ball passed a waterfall, through the clowns teeth, and under a windmill for a hole in one just isn't fun anymore.  Well, those days are gone.  TopGolf has arrived and they aren't going anywhere anytime soon.  TopGolf Rocks!!

I had such a great time at TopGolf that I even texted a few friends and family to get their butts here as soon as possible.  TopGolf is all about fun and entertainment.  Don't come here expecting to hone your golf skills so you can one day make the PGA Tour.  You come here for the experience and fun with friends/family. What makes TopGolf so fun is the different games that you can play and track on their handy dandy computer.  Accuracy games?  Yes, they have it.  The closer you get to a pin, the more points.  Sweet!!  Team games?  They have that too.  And what about those \"grip it and rip it\" types that just enjoy tagging that little white golf ball as far as they can.  Well, TopGolf has that to a point (range is about 250 yards deep). TopGolf is perfect for groups, teambuilding, parties (not the Vegas Baby type parties), and just chillin' with friends & family.  

LIST OF OTHER THINGS THAT TOPGOLF HAS TO OFFER. 
-Driving range has 4 floors. The 1st and 2nd floor is for all ages. The 3rd and 4th floors are for adults.  

-Equipment is provided, but you can also bring your own.  The first two floors have decent graphite shafted cavity backs.  They provide a Driver, 3-Wood, Hybrid, 4 Iron, 6 Iron, 8 Iron, and PW.  Clubs are provided for men, women, kids, and lefties. On the 3rd and 4th Floors, the clubs are Callaway Big Bertha's.  

-Awesome Service:  A++ from the moment we arrived.  We had our own hostess that was very attentive and at least 3 different employees checked on us.  And when our game wasn't working properly, a tech was called and fixed it right away.  He also comped us 15 minutes. 

-You basically rent a space, which includes your own TV, couches, golf caddy, and even a couple of usb ports to charge your phone. 

-Food:  There's a lot on the menu to get your feastmode on.  The food is not just limited to fried bar food either.  Here's a tip...don't skip the Injectable Donut Holes.  

-Bar and Drinks:  You can order your drinks through your hostess or at one of their multiple bars armed with video poker machines.  They have beer pong too.  On a side note...I once won a beer pong tourney at the Excalibur back in the day.  Just saying.

-Huge TV's everywhere, including a couple of big screens at the end of the range.  

-Swimming Pool:  Yes, there's a pool here.   

-Price:  Cost is by the hour with the best rates during the day.  At first, I thought that TopGolf was on the pricey side. But then I came to my senses and realized what our money gave us back in return. 

OVERALL:  I had great time and can't wait to come back.  A golf range is where you go to practice your swing and improve your handicap.  TopGolf is for all skill levels looking to have good time playing a game that was never meant to be easy.

2016 Yelp Review #36"}
{"text":"First off this place is an amazing facility, and the concept of a computerized driving range with private table service food and beverage and a pool on site could be so awesome. In theory. Our golf computer went down twice (see the photo), resetting our scores both times to zero. They charge you $5 per player just to save your scores with your name?! We were without a playable computer for about 30 minutes total. Most of all though, the service was a TRAIN WRECK. We hardly ever saw our server, who was gone for 45 minutes at one point. We had items on our bill we didn't order, and the compensation for the computer problems never arrived. The manager then nickle and dimed us for 15 minute time charges for out problems, and it took nearly 45 minutes to settle the bill. I left extremely disappointed for something that could have been so awesome."}
{"text":"Second time going to a topgolf. So I am a bit biased in my experience. The first time I went was in virginia and that was top notch. It wasnt as big as this vegas one. We still had a ton of fun here as it is a really fun spot to go to with the family. Just be prepared to wait for a long time here because they dont have any reservations allowed at this location like others do. So its a bit of chaos with the lines and it was a bit dirty, tables were not really wiped down. We waited 30 mins plus and thankfully there is an area where we can chill to watch the big screen and some mini games to keep the blood flowing. When we finally got our lane, there was like 4-5 visible open lanes to our suprise given how long we waited. 

Food: we ordered some snacks and stay away from ordering fries. Typically fries is my go to inexpensive snack for the family but here....they charge you $6 for a smallll handful of gormet style fries. Big rip. Opt for the layer dip or the salt n vinager chips. Learn from our mistake.

Drinks: glad they had delicious bloody marys. That kept the grown ups happy.

Overall, we had fun and this topgolf has the flare and lines that matches vegas."}
{"text":"Love Topgolf Vegas overall but this is a very pricey venue and can sticker shock you if you play , eat, and drink for 2 hours. Alas though, it is VEGAS! It really helps to bring a local where 20% off awaits you and to play early where prices are much lower. The food here is pretty good with typical bar finger food . Burgers are ok , sea bass sliders are really good, wings typical bar fare, rock shrimp ok, flatbreads not bad, and the steak is very good. We have tried the BBq cabana meal when we had a group with us and I would avoid that selection and spend $100+ more bucks on the Cabana mixed grill! The Mixed grill was very good. Speciality cocktails are just ok here, with prices hitting $30 for 2. Buy a bucket of beer to save a few bucks . A sportsbook is actually located in this location but it is not always staffed. Great viewing areas for watching sports .  Lounges and a cool swimming pool are located on top floor as well. Its pretty dang cool. DJ's play all summer Fri-Sun. Great places to hold meetings for customers as well. Very friendly bartenders and servers. Friendly greeters too. There is even ping pong and cornhole to play. One huge tip !!  Play the video poker machines at the bar!  They spit out free drink tickets as you play!!  We played for over 2 hours and had a blast with bartenders last visit!! Fun place to bring a bigger group!! Cheers."}
{"text":"First time here and didn't know what to expect. It's located in the back of MGM but is not part of MGM Casino. They have multiple levels that groups of up to six can rent a section per hour. If you're having lots of fun you can extend your time in 15 minute increments. Its a driving range that has multiple targets that you can aim to get points. Each golf ball has a chip inside so it can detect how close you are to the target. The computer screen will let you know where the ball went if you lose track.The closer you are to the target the more points you receive. Everything is electronic, and the clubs are all provided. It's for all level of golfers. Each area that you rent comes with a couch and table so you can order food and drinks while waiting your turn. The earlier in the day you go the cheaper it is. As expected weekends are more than weekdays. Wait time for us was around 30 minutes. They also provide a shuttle to and from the MGM casino. If you go earlier in the day you can self park for free right in front but after a certain hour it is valet parking. If you're losing a lot of money on Vegas it's a good alternative to take a break from the casinos."}
{"text":"WE BE CLUB'N

... And I'm not talking about night clubs, I'm talking about golf CLUBS. 

If someone was to tell me 10 years ago that I'd be flying to Las Vegas for 30hrs to golf, I'd laugh at their face and go head to head with them on Jager shots. But here I am... picking up golf clubs and swinging at balls. 

Why. Was. This. So. Much. Fun.

We came here around 2pm, waited 30-45 minutes to get our area. We upgraded to Level 3 (21 and up only - for $10 more). The price was decent, $75 an hour. Each game is 20 balls per person and you can play as many games you want within the hour. The place is open until 3am - i heard night time they spin music but can you really see where your golf balls are hitting?! Stick to day time if you are in it for the game.

THE ATMOSPHERE.
Fancy! Nicest golf range I've seen. Mature crowd, people who ARE NOT twenty-one and sloppy with their liquor. Alot of people watching sports because they have a lounge area with cushioned seats as well as high tables with huge TV screens and a menu of (good) food. Three levels of golfing. Level 3 is the best with a bar upstairs too. There is a pool - reserved for private parties. When you get your reserved area for golfing you have your own private cushion seats and a server if you want to order food and drinks.

THE GOLFING.
There are plenty different golf clubs to choose and use. For newbies who have a hard time hitting the damn ball, pick up THE BIG DOG clubs (the fat one). We got in about 2 games (40 balls) within the hour. First few rounds took some adjusting but you find your rhythm and start smacking balls left and right. Golfing doesn't sound that fun BUT BELIEVE ME, THIS WAS SUPER FUN. Note: be sure to click on your name prior to going up because you might be hitting someone else's balls. I wish the screen would automatically change for us. 

THE FOOD.
We should have ate lunch here instead of on the strip. We ordered a side of fries and dessert called the ADULT DONUT HOLES. It cost $15 but well worth it and a shareable item. Two small containers filled with donuts and two injectors. The reason they are \"adult\" is because the cremes are infused with alcohol and you sure can taste the alcohol. The two creme flavors in the injectors were Raspberry Jelly and Bavarian Cream. 

So my future Vegas trips will consist of Food, Shows, Slots, and TOP GOLF.

JABA APPROVED. Until the next review..."}
{"text":"Okay, let me preface this review by saying you will enjoy this place depending on who you are and what you like and how much money you have. I, personally, HATED the entire experience. First, you have to wait a half an hour to get a \"Top Golf\" card if you do not have one already (it costs $$$ too). Second, you have to wait more than an hour to get into a booth (or whatever they're called). Then, once you are finally in the booth, you have to pay basically minute by minute to stay, all the while there is a constant barrage of servers and managers pressuring you to buy more crappy drinks and bar-food. All the while you are just hitting balls into a big open space? Why not just go to a driving range...? Idk, I don't get it.

You've got to be ready to drop about $200 if you're going to go here. And believe me when I tell you they WILL kick your butt out the minute you stop paying for time. We stopped playing, and had barely gathered our things before a manager came and asked us to leave for the next group. 

I understand why this place is popular. But if I'm going to spend an exorbitant amount of money on food and drinks, I'd rather go somewhere that serves excellent food and cocktails (that is not this place) without the constant pressure of wait and management staff. 

Never again."}
{"text":"So much fun... no experience needed

Great food and plenty to drink.  TV's for football watching"}
{"text":"I am always recommending this place for  everyone,,,, we always come here we have a lot of fun, playing golf   , billiards...  that is my favorite place"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I am very pleased to hear that they will have one opening soon in Cali where I live. Best idea ever! Hit balls, compete with friends, and bar service. $50 an hour. Go with a big group! Clubs etc are provided for you."}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times and liked it. Pricey but the wait was previously reasonable. Assuming a weeknight wouldn't be too packed, we decided to come on a Tuesday night. We picked level 2 because it was only an hour wait. 
We waited TWO AND A HALF hours. We waited so long, Bob at the bar asked us what we were waiting for so he could find out how much longer the wait would be. We got to play golf for less than 30 minutes because our family from out of town had show tickets at 10:30pm. We arrived at top golf around 6:30pm with plenty of time to spare before the show. We had to rush a few hits of golf so they could experience it, and had to practically run out. They were still late to their show. Bob at the bar tonight 3/28 was my saving grace. He got us drinks, helped me with food, and kept us entertained while we waited. Thank you Bob! 

We always mention Top Golf as a place to visit but probably won't be as eager any more. If the wait is going to be longer, please let the guest know so they can make other arrangements or notify them if any spots open up on a different level. 

There were plenty of reserved seats on levels 3 and 4. When we asked why the wait was so long they started talking about companies that were staying longer than expected.

If you're going to cater to companie$ that's fine, but don't screw over other paying customers because you didn't time it well."}
{"text":"Came here again with family this time and we had the best time.

We had little bit confusion about the booking online, but the manager took care of it with no problem!

We originally had our bay on regular high table since we brought my 91 years young mother in law, we requested to move to the sofa instead and our bay attendant helped us with no problems at all, that was great.

We ordered couple light food here since it was a bit early for lunch and we loved it. Nacho was delicious and my son had chicken tender with fruit was yummy.

The service is great as always here, thank you again Topgolf!"}
{"text":"This is my first Top Golf experience and I was blown away.  I am a Las Vegas local for part of the year.  

Easy entrance can be found just off of Koval, between Tropicana and Harmon.  The parking lot is huge and valet is there at specific times (when it is busy I would guess...it was not available when I showed up a noon on a Thursday). 

As a general patron, I was impressed by the size of this place, the four extensive floors, the big bars (two total!), the pretty pool, ample shade and hospitable staff.    As a local, without any charge to enter the facility, you could come on in, drink at the bar, people watch the golfers and even eat a meal.  The bartender informed us that we could even take a swim if we wanted.  We had lunch and enjoyed a really great meal!  All items were fresh, creative and tasty, especially the rock shrimp appetizer.  Food was about $10-15 an option and a beer set us back $7.50 a piece.  

There are air conditioned parts of the facility, but the place for the most part is outside, heavily covered with fans and misters about.  Even in 115 degree heat, I was surprised I did not feel hotter than I should, considering it was noon when I was there.  

As a golfer, I was impressed by their golf set up.  After lunch, we then paid to play for an hour, which for the two of us, was $30 a person, plus $5 for a little membership of sorts (this part is optional).  Rates vary based on time of day, floor level and maybe day of week (not certain).  First floor was more kid friendly, so it would be my rule to stay away (LOL!).  They were busy at noon on a Thursday, but there was no wait and we easily were able to eat, drink and play some golf.  

After you check in for your specific numbered spot at the front desk, a host will show you to your golf area.  You pay for your time after you play, not before when you get your spot.  Couches, bar/food server, Callaway club selections (for both men and women....although you can bring your own clubs as well).  The yardage and games are all controlled via a computer screen and their golf Top Golf technology.  Hit the ball and your yardage is recorded on the computer screen behind you.  It keeps your score as you play with a partner or a group.  The hour goes by quickly and it is easy to see how your tab could rise quickly...just kind of know this before you go.  

This place I thought was awesome though, as a patron and a golfer.  I was really impressed.  I was advised that this is their cream of the crop locations in the Top Golf family of facilities across the USA, because of four floors and pool, amongst other things.  To do with friends, a group or just my spouse, I would enjoy going back and look forward to doing so in the near future."}
{"text":"In a word \"excessive\". 

On a Thursday night and excited to come for the first time i was a bit overwhelmed when we pulled up. Valet was super backed up but not a bit deal, as i can be patient at times. Walked up to the counter and was told that it was an hour to hour and 15 minute wait. Got on the list and began to walk around the facility to check it all out and take in the view. Sure the facility is well setup with bars, tvs, and a few games, and what i enjoyed was plenty of seating on all floors. What i didnt like during my tour around was the fact that it was obvious that the place wasnt packed enough to justify a wait of an hour, or really a wait at all. I honestly feel as if it was a tactic to force you to order food & drinks and get a tab started. Once we finally got a spot to hit from the 1st floor, the machines were a bit slow on reading the balls, but it wasnt horrible. The games are entertaining and its nice that they provided clubs even though they were not the greatest (better than nothing). We played for an hour and change, had a pitcher of beer and a few drinks between the 3 of us and the tab came out to $210. Im sorry but i felt that was a bit ridiculous. I will not be going back for the sheer cost of the experience here. You cannot use the same excuse everyone does when things are over prices \"but its Vegas\"... who cares, as hitting balls at a traditional range is pennies compared to this madness. Its the new thing to do in Vegas, but i came, i hit, and im running...."}
{"text":"Came here after work today. Had a great time golfing. We obviously had some drinks that were very tasty. A few of our more tipsy friends got a ride home with the more sober people and when we called to make sure it was ok to leave the cars over night, we were informed that unless you have a flat tire or dead battery, you are not allowed to leave you car. This makes me think they encourage drunk driving. Be careful."}
{"text":"Top golf it self was a really fun time, but Desiree our server and was not attentive at all, she would walk away as we were still speaking to her. She made our first time experience miserable. Never checked on us and we had to walk to the bar to place drink orders. She made us feel as if we were an inconvenience for her. Of course once we closed out check she pretty much kicked us out."}
{"text":"We have family visiting and a gift card for Top Golf, so thought it would be a great time to go. We called during the day to get a reservation and they told us they would not be able to take a reservation, that it would be first come first serve. No problem.
We arrived around 7pm and were told that it would be a 2 hour wait to get into a bay. We hadn't eaten yet, so decided to get on the wait list and go eat. We drive down the road, find a place to eat and bing....15 minutes later....a text that our bay is ready. We have an option to get it in 15 minutes, 30 minutes or 1 hour. We select 30 minutes, abandon our dinner plans and head back. When we arrive, we are told it will be a 1 hour wait. (red face hangry emoji here). We are so pissed at this point that we all need a drink. We got reverse geo-fenced which is a genius marketing move, but makes for a poor guest experience.  
Long story short is that it did take an hour. There is just way to much friction to go here. It was so hot inside, so slow, text message game playing, and they don't care because they are making money hand over fist. I hate this place, if we have company that wants to go there in the future, they will be going solo. I'd rather be at Disneyland the first day of summer break than to every go back to Top Golf."}
{"text":"Was able to bypass the typical two hour stall rental requirement and have my resort concierge make a reservation even though it was only for one hour.   Excellent!    Service was great, prompt and since several people had never played Topgolf before, our hostess walked everyone through setting up an account and programming their names into the computer.  Very helpful.   

Our servers were prompt for the most part although keeping waters filled did seem to be a challenge.   One thing I liked very much about this particular Topgolf is the bank of multiple supermassive jumbotrons outside the net at the end of the driving range, so any sporting events etc that are on are going to be easily visible.  Pretty cool.  I ordered what basically amounts to a snack / charcuterie board for the booth and it was both sizable and quite good.  I've had food at Topgolf several times before, so wasn't really surprised, but I think everyone else was a little surprised that such a venue would have good eats.  

I do wish that I had booked a multi-hour reservation instead of extending once the first hour was up.  I think it would have cost less money in the long run, but live and learn.   

Excellent Topgolf experience!  Vegas Baby!!!"}
{"text":"A nice change to the usual Vegas scene. Everything about Top Golf has the luxurious grand feel that Vegas has to offer. Unlike the \"regular\" driving ranges I've been to, this one has shade, seats, alcohol, tv, golf balls with tracking device, just to name a few. Love how you get to relax with drinks and snacks and doughnuts you can inject with alcoholic goodness. The balls come out automatically with the wave of your golf club! There's targets you can aim for to compete with your friends. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were great, golfing was a blast, but I knocked off a few stars because the girl that set us up with our lane- Bailey, had an attitude more suited for the DMV, or maybe somewhere with no human interaction at all. We showed up all smiles and excitement for our first Top golf experience and she had us all pretty upset in under 5 minutes with her nasty attitude. I almost called the manager over after some of her completely inappropriate comments to my mom, plus the fact that she started our time without telling us and before our full party had arrived, but didn't want it to ruin our night. Once she was gone our waiter was great and we had tons of fun. Will go back, just not to that one."}
{"text":"So much fun!!! Not much is better then a great evening with friends having a few drinks and hitting some balls. Top Golf is clean, fun, service is great, prices are good. Awesome fun for all ages!"}
{"text":"Done.  Over it.  This place has ton of potential and I can see why people have given it 5 stars.  Drinks are well made and almost all of the food is really good.  But I've come here to play golf.  I'm still waiting.  After two visits to this place, I admit they were on busy Saturday nights, we have yet to actually get a lane.  

Both times we showed up knowing the wait was going to be long.  So we bellied up to the bar, ordered some food and got our names on the waiting list.  Both times we were told it was a 2.5 hour wait.  In speaking with the employee with signed up with, we were told it would probably be under 2 hours in actuality.  Well bot times we were 3.5 hours into our wait before we tossed in the towel.  

If you don't have hours just to sit around and wait, don't plan on playing any golf.  Whatever they tell you the wait it, add an hour.  Good Luck!"}
{"text":"This is a great hangout place with reasonable drinks prices and okay food. The environment is fun and there's always someone to talk too. The only reason I gave 3 stars is because the bartenders barely ever smile and I always feel super uncomfortable. I tip well, order drinks and came to relax and mingle. They are look so angry other then that you'll love it here, if you can get pass the bartenders frowning."}
{"text":"This is a must if you're j. The Phoenix/Scottsdale area. 

This place is a blast for any and all ages. Even if you're not into golf I guarantee you will have a blast. 

Think of a driving range/bar/dance club. 

Can't remember how many times I've been here but every time has been fantastic. Each group gets their own booth with very comfortable seating. Atmosphere is very relaxed. 

The service is very friendly and on top of it. 

It can get very busy in the evening. If that's the case you can grab a golf cart over to the casino and when your lane is ready they will call you."}
{"text":"Waiting for our golf bay, happy to sit by the bar area to wait but can't get wait staff to stop and take our order.  After 30 minutes and pleading with a Wait staffer that was standing around (who apologized and said he'd send someone right over) we gave up."}
{"text":"Always have great service. The facility is clean and their food menu is great. The wait can be 30 min or more on weekends but that's okay.. especially when you hang out and grab some drinks at the bar while waiting! Look forward to coming here with friends every so often and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Love the concept and great atmosphere. Showed up last week at 5pm and already had a 2- hour wait. Great bar and tv's to pass the time. Only complaint was our waiter could not handle the bay's he was responsible for. Waited awhile for food and drinks. One time we just went to the bar directly to get drinks. 

Cool concept though we will be back."}
{"text":"This place is not cheap. Very cool concept to play golf while getting together with friends. Everything is expensive here. Easily spent a few hundreds in 2 hours."}
{"text":"I have been to top golf now 3 times. The first two times the service was fantastic as I was with a large group for work. This past Saturday I went again with family - they said 20-30 min for the 3rd floor we ending up waiting almost an hour and a half!! The bay was supposed to be $75/hr and they charged us $90/hr! Had to wait another 30 min for a manager to clear it up. This place is awesome but the service needs improvement - disappointed but will be back to try again. It's still new!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out & fun game but their rule about no outside food & drinks (including my water bottle) is fu*%ing ridiculous & stupid."}
{"text":"I walked in Tuesday night after a long flight from LA. I sat at the bar hoping to watch the dodger game and have a cold beer and a burger. I was the only customer with in 5 seats. 5 bar tenders walked  by me time and time again. not even a hello , a few made eye contact but nothing more. A few guys walked in three seats down and got served a drink in less than 60 sec. I know it was nothing personal against me but that is not the point. I feel everybody in the place should greeted  me when I walked in,  yet not one single person at the bar did. I left after speaking to the manager and unfortunately I'm writing this review from another restaurant down the street. customer service and attitude are key to delivering a good experience. I will not hold it against them but they may need to revisit their customer service training .....thanks"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for fun, with or without kids. Great food, fast friendly service."}
{"text":"If you're in Nevada this place is a must. Extremely clean very organized and the food is worthy of a five-star restaurant.  We signed up for an hour of golf and ended up staying for three. Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Little pricey but still a lot of fun. The food is really good. Make reservations if you want level 2 or 3.  Staff is super nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"I was actually really impressed with topgolf. It really is quite a beautiful space to golf. It's a great place to come with friends and make fun of how horrible their swing is. 

Pros: Local discount, beautiful view, awesome food(reasonable price).

Cons: Loooong wait time(2-3 hours unless you reserve a pay with a minimum food and beverage tab) \"Server\" was really rude. I was a server for 4 years and she definitely needs to learn a thing or two about customer service. 

Overall I definitely want to come back but will request a different server if she is assigned to that bay."}
{"text":"What a luxury. It's like the concept of bowling mixed with the driving range. You're offered drinks and food through table service while you hit balls or sit with your buddies covered in the cool shade outside. Even the golf balls roll back up to you like bowling balls do at the alley. There's a scoreboard that tracks how far you've hit each ball if you manage to sink your ball into one of the colored targets in the green. Very fun and very cool. It was only $25/ hour and a bucket of bud light bottles was about $25 as well. Clubs are provided. Staff were attentive and friendly. I was worried about showing up in flip flops but it didn't matter at all. Didn't happen to try any of the food. One negative: The netting is an absolute eyesore to the desert landscape, but I guess you can't really escape that if you want to experience this unique driving range. Overall, a very fun and novel outdoor experience."}
{"text":"What a fantastic concept. I really enjoy bars/nightspots that have things to do. This is putt putt for grown ups but better!(and a lot more difficult)  Every player has to purchase a player card, then you can choose to buy bay time in one or split it evenly among the player cards. Each bay has a set of men's clubs and women's clubs, with pretty decent variety (driver, 3 wood, hybrid 3 wood, a couple irons, wedge). The computer system is very easy to navigate, just tap on your name and step up to take how ever many shots you want for each turn! We were on the second level, which definitely helped a few of our causes on achieving distance in one round of play. 
The only reason this review isn't a 5 is because the waiter service was a tad slow at times and we were there later in the night until closing, they weren't that busy. But great selection of mixed drinks/beer(bucket deals)/wines. I can't wait for the location to open in Ohio!"}
{"text":"I came here one Sunday night and I'm hooked! The golf is so much fun. It's 45$ per the hour during their night time. It's much better during the night than during their morning hours. During the night, the lights come on and the shooting range looks so pretty. I have heard that during Saturday nights the lines get pretty long. I was glad I went on a Sunday night. There is no real wait time ok Sunday, you can get a spot pretty quickly. 

The food was surprising good too! Please take a look my pictures. You will see the delicious spread of food they offer. However, I would suggest that you not order their chicken and waffle. Besides that one dish, everything else came out delicious. 

I look forward to spending more time here!"}
{"text":"This place is super fun! Its a driving range but 100% better with the digital features! Great for corporate events, party's or even a couple friends hanging out having a good time. The only negatives is that the drinks and food are pricey and if you go in the dead of summer (like my party did) its uncomfortably hot and no AC where we were since its outside. Other than that, it was a fun time!"}
{"text":"So fun! They have someone there to teach you how to swing! The food is awesome (and so are the beverages!) new to town with friends? Do this."}
{"text":"Coming from DC, the alexandria top golf was my favorite spot in the world until I got here. THE PLACE HAS TWO POOLS FOLKS! 
I know you don't usual think of golf when you're on a weekend in Vegas but do not brush off this gem. It's LIT"}
{"text":"BEST FIRST TIME EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE THANKS TO DAKOTA STORM! That's the man! Highly suggest if your going to try this place out ask for him! He goes above and beyond!"}
{"text":"Top Golf is one of my favorite spots to hang out! It's a fun environment and every time we've been there we have had good service all around. I always bring my family and friends that come visit to Top Golf! It's such a great concept!"}
{"text":"Yes this place is expensive but you get what you pay for and I love coming here.  I have been here over 20 times.  The staff here is always energetic and happy to say hello with a smile.  

?? Tyler and D.J. have always been great help when I need to make a booking for friends visiting town.  Saturday and Sundays sell out every single week now so it's important to make reservations 2-4 weeks prior for prime time slots.  

In my opinion it's worth paying extra for Level 3 and if you have a large party there is a private area on Level 4 you can rent out!  If you have 2-4 people I suggest 1 hour.  If you have 6-8 people 2 - 3 hours is great!

The food and drinks are amazing!  My personal favorite is the PB&J PORK BURGER.  It's so unique and tasty.  

Pricing does fluctuate based on the day and time so it's best to call the venue and ask for D.J. or Tyler to book your time slot!  Mention that Brian T. sent you!"}
{"text":"This place is a great time, been there twice now. Food is awesome, staff is friendly and prices are decent. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"At first I was very hesitant to go because I'm not really a golfer, but I'm glad I did because I didn't feel out of place. You kind'a just have your own space and it's very cozy and relaxing. They  have a very friendly staff. Also there's a little gaming area to keep everybody entertained while waiting to be seated. There's also a live band. The food is great but too pricey. Everyone who went enjoyed it and wanted to go back again."}
{"text":"Everything was good and fun up until when our hour of time was up!! They barged in to clean up and get us out so they could get their next customer/dollar sign seated ASAP. We couldn't even get up before they were bumping into us as we tried to escape the seating area. Just bummed that happened after all the fun we had, left a bad taste in my mouth. Felt like we were treated like just another number. They'll need to work on their customer service a bit and it's good to go."}
{"text":"Food, Drinks, SHADE, and Golf.  Such a great combo!  Fun place with friends or as a date night."}
{"text":"This place was extremely fun and great for kids. Although it can get VERY, VERY pricey the longer you stay there and the later in the day it is (up to $45 an hour per person). They also have a full menu to order from and even many vegetarian options! Their salsa is superb and I was hoppin my booty while noming on their tasty chips. If money isn't tight for you, then I would highly recommend this place... Just sayin"}
{"text":"First time at TopGolf. Previewed it online to see what to expect and see why everyone was talking about it. It actually looked pretty cool so I went to check it out with some of my buddies. Let's start with the good news and I'll end it with the bad:

Positives:

- The concept is pretty cool, it's kind of like going to a bowling alley. Instead of bowling alleys, they have \"bays\". Each bay can have up to 10 people but only 6 can be logged on to play. Another difference is, you don't take turns driving the ball, but instead, you have 20 balls \"per game\" and you can switch off between people by selecting your name on the screen at any time. You pay for bays on the hour so if you're a good and efficient hitter, you can get in more than one game. 

- Food and drinks are normal, nothing special. This place is on the strip so expect to pay above average

- Environment is great. There is uptempo music on floors 3&4 ($75.00 per hour on bays) and kid-friendly bays are on floors 1&2 ($60.00 per hour)

- The views on these bays are unbelievable. You can see the strip and it's beautiful. There are also 4 big screen TVs for you to watch sports

- Great place to hang out to drive balls

Cons:

- They DO NOT have a parking lot. They only have valet at the moment. If you want self-parking, you have to park at MGM. Supposedly there's a shuttle, but I took my chances and walked. It's right across the street and took me 5 minutes. 

- If you self-parked, it's a journey because you have to walk along Wet Republic and it's quite confusing if you miss the directions. 

- TopGolf has installed amazing technology for the range of your balls to be tracked. But if you do not hit inside the targets, you get a ZERO. It's ridiculous for you to hit a ball very far out and if it doesn't land on a target, you receive a goose egg. 

That's about it, I guess for the money I spend to hit balls, I'd rather go to a cheaper regular driving range and if I'm going to spend $60 per hour. I'd rather go to a golf course. That's why I gave this place 3 stars. Nothing special, but also not basic. 

I would recommend going here just to experience it though, quite a few celebrities already stopped by this place and it's not your typical driving range."}
{"text":"I booked this spot for my 11 of us and got to work with Alishia and Bo.  Alishia set us up and booked us for the event.  She was very helpful and the booking process couldn't have been easier.  

When we arrived, we were greeted by Bo who took care of us for the day.  He was amazing.  Friendly, informative, funny, and provided us with perfect service.  This can be very difficult with 11 inebriated guys on a bachelor party so I have to give him a hell of a lot of credit.  We were all very grateful for his help and wish him the best.

It was a fantastic experience, one which I will recommend highly."}
{"text":"I had never done topgolf before but have heard how popular it was so thought I'd do it for my birthday. I was pleasantly surprised to find out the wait was only 15 minutes when we got there. They had table shuffle board on the 2nd floor so we played that as we waited. FYI: topgolf does have their own parking lot and no cost! If you go from the mgm and take the shuttle be sure to go to the lobby to catch it. Do not follow signs for topgolf.  The staff was nice and explained how to play. The hour went so fast but we had a lot of fun. If you don't finish a game before the time runs out the score disappears so you can't get a picture."}
{"text":"Great and friendly staff! Bar and food while you wait for your bay to be ready and just an all around cool thing to do. You don't have to be good at golf (I'm not) to have fun! Great thing to do with families, friends, dates, anyone!!"}
{"text":"Celebrated a friends birthday and the atmosphere was great. Nice overall setting. I am not a golfer, but it was fun attempting to play while big screen TVs are ahead of you. The prices are reasonable for an outing, the drinks are ok, but a little overpriced. They do serve food as well, but I didn't try it this time. It is likely that I will return to play golf again."}
{"text":"Pretty good experience for a first time visit.  Lots of un for everyone (17 people from 30-65). The food was above average, fast and professional service from all employees.  Avalon was our personal server and one of the best I have ever been served by.  Will go back."}
{"text":"This place was neat!!  Something different.  To hit golf balls off a building was fun.  The scenery in background was beautiful.  The only thing I would recommend is to ask how to get there.  We walked and walked and followed signs until we found it.  Afterwards we found out there was a shuttle that takes you to it because it is behind the MGM. Also, I would make reservations.   If you are looking to do something different this is the place"}
{"text":"Pricey, but everyone should try it at least once. Food is pricey as well. Services was very good, employees are friendly."}
{"text":"Brutal experience. No one knows what the hell is going on here!!! Bearing in mind that we saw 8 open booths, we still had to wait 1.5 hours to get on. Fun time on the course and good facilities. Then disgusted to wait another 30 minutes to get our car. It's already been a long day. Don't go here!!!"}
{"text":"We had a blast here. Sort of unusual circumstance. Family gathering from all over the country after a death in the family. Well, we have all been together grieving since Tuesday and by Friday we decided we needed a fun thing to do...just needed to get out of the house. 

Got here around 9 and were brought to a bay on floor 1. Server came right away and he was very attentive. Golf was fun for our family members from ages 10-75. 

Food was good, beer was cold. It was fun. The only thing I would suggest was someone to explain the computer system. Luckily people in our party had been there before so they knew what to do. 

Even with our circumstances, it was a fun night. Fore!!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place. 
Great place when maybe you feel like you've done a lot of the same old thing in Vegas. We went for a 40th birthday and got a pool cabana with 8 people. Crowd pleaser across he board. 3 golfed and loved it, 5 pooled/ate yummy food and had cocktails. It was terrific. Raven was absolutely wonderful. Incredibly helpful/informative  and attentive without being over the top.  Would definitely return. Now if only the rest of the top golfs would add a pool..."}
{"text":"I have heard nothing but good things about TOPGOLF from friends and family.  So much we want to see what the hype is all about. I have been trying to call the Las Vegas location since 9am.  No one picks up the phone and I had to leave 2 messages.  (No call back). I just finally got a real live person who was not friendly and not very helpful with our inquiry.  We have been to this place ever... So of course we have lots of questions. Person who answered the phone did not seem to want to answer any questions...  And if a question was answered.... It was very short.  Very disappointed in my first time ever calling this place to get info on reservations.  I hope the service there.....  When or if we go is not like what we had on the phone."}
{"text":"This place is basically like a lucky strike but for golf!  It has a very modern design with all the glowing neon lights and futuristic technology.  I think we went in on a weekend during the day time and it was maybe about $60 for a pod of 10 people (fact check???).  You pay by the hour which was honestly enough time for 20 attempts for 5 people.. but this may also be because we were all beginners and just doing whatever.  The workers are very helpful here.. they meet you at the pod and go over all the safety rules and will teach you the basics of a golf swing if you ask them!  We definitely needed this considering we were all beginners and it was really helpful.  This place is like a lucky strike in that there are servers at each of the pods and a whole menu filled with bar foods (finger foods) and drinks (mostly alcoholic).  There are different levels, all of which have the driving range platform.. but I think it's basically by which spots are open.  As a beginner, I would've preferred to have a higher tier because my logic is that the ball would travel further?

Top Golf is essentially a sports bar.  Along with the main aspect of being a driving range, they have a separate room with GIANT multiscreen televisions displaying all the different sports games.  In this room, they have a bar, many couches with a heater lamp, couple shuffleboard tables, and a beanbag game (I forget the proper term for the game).  This is a fun place to visit if you're not 21 in Vegas, but honestly .. As a college student, most people just go to Vegas for the clubs.  I would really enjoy if they had a Top Golf in LA!"}
{"text":"This is the coolest driving range on the strip was worth a $45 to play here,the staff are friendly and they give some good advice for beginners and new commers they also provide the most high quality golf clubs as well so next time you're in Vegas I highly recommend Topgolf for a good time"}
{"text":"First time here was recommended by my co-worker. Wow very cool. Very entertaining place to have a party with some friends. I was surprised by the quality of food. Great service with lots of fun. Will be back."}
{"text":"So I told my boyfriend about this amazing heaven on earth place in Chicago called Topgolf.  Sadly, the closest one to Los Angeles is in Scottsdale, AZ. Of course, after telling him about it, the only right thing to do was drive there.

And it was awesome!

Due to the drive, we arrived kinda late, close to 8 pm.  I would suggest getting there early because it's THE happening spot. Even though there were a lot of people, the process was smooth.  There was valet, but my friend just dropped us off and she looked for parking. My bf and I checked in and were told it was a 2.5 hour wait.  It was ok because we just headed to the bar and I had the tater tots. 

I am quite obsessed with the tater tots.  You have to have the tater tots.

Anyway, although it was busy, the flow was fine.  We just went to the bar and had food and bevs. Also, the staff was ridiculously nice and accessible.  If you had a question, there was always someone around, whether the bar, the floor or the bay. Once we got a bay, they helped us get situated and bring out stuff to the bay.

Note: Topgolf on a Saturday night is more akin to a happening bar than a driving range-- people were in casual going out/bar-hopping clothes, compared to golf gear in Chicago.  Also, I think my friend who lives out there and I were the only ones who brought our own clubs.  No biggy.  I was there for the tots, beverages, and golf-- in that order.  It's Topgolf on a Saturday night.  It's more of a party.  Just letting you know this so that if you are a serious golfer and really want to practice your drive, you know what's up.  You can still practice, but don't get Type A-anal-retentive about the crowd.

Super fun place from novice to advanced golfers or people on dates or trying to get a date."}
{"text":"Outstanding time. The interactive golf is next level. I'm okay with standard golf but this was just so much better. Good beer. Good food. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I Network a lot across the Valley of The Sun and I recently discovered TopGolf in Gilbert AZ for Events. It is a Top Rate Venue when it comes to any Special Event, Meetings, or Weekly Networking gatherings. They handle party's of seven (7) or more with an amazing service staff and accommodations throughout the facility. You book your event, whether it is a Family Reunion, Bachelor(ette) Partys, Company Deals, really anything, then just show up. They have what I call OffShore Golfing but much much more. Conference rooms, Dancing, and the Food is amazing, served by a Five Star Staff! The service and presentation is very professional with very nice ambiance and their Digital Technology suits small or larger presentations. Book it and you will not be disappointed. The group who invited me meets weekly there and they work with Michael Miller who can book your Corporate or Special Event at TopGolf. Phone 480-878-6653 Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good food, good beer, and A LOT of fun. I do not golf at all, but I had an amazing time. Anyone can come and play and have a great experience. I definitely recommend coming here"}
{"text":"Typically pretty busy in the evenings at this location. Have been here several times now. We've had great food every time and great service 4/5 times. Some servers are more experienced than others. The smart ones take care of people who will tip well. Others take care of their friends. But overall great place to kill a few hours, eat a good meal and play so golf/games."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to a top golf. I'm in town for a work event and my entire team went to this top golf tonight. We were given a putting space up on the third floor. First I want to say how beautiful the view is. The mountains in the background are amazing especially from the third floor. We were there in the evening and also ordered food. The food is OK nothing gourmet. The service was good though the waitress is very prompt and polite. The golf game itself was a lot of fun and the set up of the course is really cool. As the sun goes down the view gets even better between the sunset and the way the course gets lit up combined with the view of the very colorfully lit casino in the background. I'm giving top golf in Phoenix Arizona four out of five stars because the views are amazing the game is fun but the food is just OK if the food was awesome I probably would've given it five stars honestly. Can't wait to go to top golf back at home and take my husband now that I know what a fun experience it is. I think this is more fun with a group then just one or two people would be."}
{"text":"I so want to like this place!  Being local and a golfer, the facility is really fantastic.  I'm even OK with the strip premium prices on everything.  What's not OK, is the service.  Last week went to their \"Movie at the Pool\" and while the movie was showing, there was no sound!  Asked the bartender what was going on with it and he said he didn't know.  And that was it!  Seriously? 
 Finished our drinks and left out of frustration.  

Went back this week for a corporate event.  Checked in at the Corporate Event desk and was told, \"I'm not sure, I think it's on the 3rd floor.\"  Mistakenly walked up to the 4th floor, asked again about the event and was only told we're \"on the wrong floor, check at the Corporate Event desk downstairs.\"  Instead went down to the 3rd floor, was told there were no events on that floor and finally an employee went downstairs with us to figure it out.  Finally found the event, nice food and decent drinks.  Goes to show once again it's SERVICE that makes and breaks a place a lot faster than prices, facilities, and food."}
{"text":"Great experience, I'm horrible at golf and so are the friends I went with, but it was fun. We never felt bad or embarrassed because of our skill or lack there of. The server was great as well as the food. Will be back again for sure. Btw no chipmunks were there!"}
{"text":"In February 2015 I decided to become a Platinum Member after going there a week before with one of my sons. I met with Eddie Gardner and he explained the contract which cost $250 a month plus tax. For that my family got to golf from Open to 5pm on weekdays and until noon on the weekends. Plus I got a $120 credit to golf anytime after those hours. I figured if I went with my family or clients once a week it would pay for itself. Also, there is a $125 start up fee. Below is the good and the bad about this place.

Good

1) Great food. They honestly have some of the best chefs working there. The food was always top notch.

2) Great bay host. These people were always fast and pleasant to deal with. 

3) Rhonda Carlton - She is a Platinum member host. Extremely fun and pleasant. Will do anything to make you happy.

4) It's fun..at least for the first few months.I think I went maybe a bit too much during the \"honeymoon\" period. Most people there are not serious golfers and just like to have a good time. 

Bad 

1) I was never explained by Eddie there's a $500 cancellation fee. Now, it is in the contract so shame on me for not reading that. But I feel that is something that should of been said up front. Think about it...why $500? They deactivate me as a member and that's it. How hard can it be? Since February I spent probably 3k here and now they want another $500? 

2) Don't sign up if you are left handed. I guess left handed clubs are limited there. I went a few times and couldn't golf because they didn't have any. And on other visits I had to wait to get them. It's great to pay $250 a month to watch others golf. This was frustrating.

3) Most Platinum events are lame. Some were nice but a Monday morning golf tournament? A event to fix up old bicycles? I'm all for charity and doing nice things but having this as the monthly activity? Really? 

4) As a Platinum Member I got 10% off of food. The problem is the food servers never remembered to take it off when I got the bill. And when I asked about it afterwards they said they couldn't take it off after the transaction was ran. Ok..I get it's only 10% but why even have this as a perk if they don't take it off? 

5) \"We will work on it\". After every complaint I had in regards to the clubs, the 10% or something else that is what was said. That's all fine and dandy but what about a small gift card for lunch or an appetizer? Perhaps additional golf time added? Nothing. Overall management just has POOR customer service and they all need to take a class on pleasing the customer. Eddie Gardner couldn't say \"Thank you\" or \"Have a nice day\" to save his life. Even when I inquired about canceling he didn't ask why and just said it will be $500 plus tax. 

My advice - if you are considering becoming a member and you are on the fence about signing up..hold off. Just pay for it each time you go.  After 3 months I couldn't even drag my kids there anymore. Also, I believe they need to be in business a few more years and get some higher quality people on the management staff. I'm sure after this review the marketing director will say \"Thanks for your review and we will make every attempt to make your experience better in the future\" or something like that."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Top Golf!

When we visited the parking lot was closed because of a convention, but we were able to park at MGM and walked down. The walk wasn't far and we were able to walk through the casino and near their pool area, so it was a good view. They also have signs all along the walk way to guide you to your destination (Top Golf)

My favorite thing about Top Golf is that you can come and enjoy their pools, their pool table, their giant tvs, their outdoor bars, their corn hole, their ping pong tables without playing golf. I also loved their delicious food and drink menu as well as an amazing view of the high roller (Linq).

This is a nice chill place with great food that is worth a try."}
{"text":"Very fun place to go to with family and friends. Food is great, as is the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Our 6 night stay in Vegas included a visit to Topgolf . My 4 boys ranging in ages of 5,6,12 & 17 had a blast ! They loved it so much that hubby added another hour . I enjoyed myself as well . Our server was very attentive , refilling our ice water . We didn't order anything from the menu because we had just had brunch but some items on the menu did sound appetizing . It can be pricey depending what time you go and there is a third floor or top floor that caters to a younger group . Families usually use the bays on the 1st and 2nd floor . We will definitely visit again . My only grip is a $5 membership fee per person and since we are a family of 6 that added an extra $30 to our bill . Just seemed unnecessary. But I'm still giving 5 stars . I do hope they continue the great service and welcoming faces."}
{"text":"This is undoubtedly my favorite place for social events whether you are going out for a date night, fun night with a small group of friends, or a corporate team build, Top Golf accommodates all.  Even if you have never played golf, Top Golf is a blast!  Think if it as a driving range with a lot of fun games built by technology.  They offer also a significant discount for locals on hourly rates, food, and souvenirs in the pro shop.

The food is quite good considering the fast paced environment; I would recommend the burgers and the pretzel plate was outstanding!  They have a full bar and waiter service directly to your golf bay.

Positives
1) All of the game options are fun and there is certainly something for everyone.  You can play games like \"Top Golf\" that reward points for hitting into any of the game targets or get challenging and play \"Top Chip\" where you are required to hit a specific colored target to score, land in another target and points are taken away.
2) Food menu is pretty expansive and includes appetizers and entrees.  Something for every taste on the menu.
3) Full bar and waiter service directly to your golf bay.  Just sit back and relax while your drinks and food are delivered to your comfortable seating area.  You can enjoy your meal and drinks while playing and watching your friends!
4) 21 & over only allowed on the 3rd floor if you want to avoid the younger participants.  The 3rd floor is more expensive than floors 1 & 2 however.
5) Hours of operation are extended compared to other Top Golf locations!  Rates vary by day of the week and time of day, just know Friday & Saturday after 5pm is the most expensive and in turn the most crowded so you may have to wait.  I recommend early in the day on weekends; get there right at opening and book a two hour block and enjoy lunch.
6) Significant discount for locals, I believe it was 20-25% on all food, hourly rates, and souvenirs.  Don't quote me on that but it was very generous!

Negatives 
1) Top Golf Las Vegas is the only Top Golf location where you CANNOT make a reservation unless you are booking a corporate event.  You cannot reserve bays even during non-peak times during the week.
2) As most things in Vegas are expensive; Top Golf Las Vegas is no different.  Hourly rates for bays are as high as $90/hour during peak.  You can put up to 6 players in a bay though; but if you do put 6 just know you will watch most of the action and only hit your 20 balls.  A group of 6 will take close to an hour to play any of the game options.  Optimal size of a group for a bay is 4!
3) Parking is extremely limited so take a free shuttle if you are staying at MGM or grab an Uber/Lyft or cab."}
{"text":"Love it!! 
From the time we walked in (with a reservation) to the time we hit the parking lot our service was fantastic! Drinks and food came quickly and weren't outrageously priced for Vegas. The concept and setup are friendly to everyone- from the dude in the next bay who took it way too seriously and brought his own clubs to a couple of people in our group who'd never swung a club, everyone had a good time.
As mentioned in a few other reviews, the food isn't that great (3stars tops on it's own) but the facility, staff and ambience is nothing but good times!

WHEN YOU GO- Go at night to get the big screen experience at the end of the range and also the light up targets. I also recommend the top tier if you can get it. FORE!!!"}
{"text":"Top Golf is a wonderful family experience.  It is designed for all levels of golf and players can be of mixed abilities.  It sure beats a bowling alley for a similar type of group activity and the food is more appealing. I would consider Top Golf for a company outing, celebration or family activity."}
{"text":"Terrible experience spent $400 and the manager with the pink hair pressured us to leave, didn't allow us to finish our food/drinks without anyone waiting behind us on a slow night. Will never go back and hope you never do either, it's a joke."}
{"text":"About 45 bucks a game staff is nice but the wait times are about a hour or more on the weekends! 
Thank you Trish S. For reaching out your staff is very friendly and although most of the games were full your staff kept my parties glasses full while we waited. Great place for large parties."}
{"text":"LOVED this place! Brilliant idea for something different to do in Vegas. Fabulous combination of bar, golf, games, good food & drink. Going back again today!"}
{"text":"Extremely rude staff, if you're a serious golfer go ahead and skip this one. The place is crowded, there's never enough room to sit at the bar and wait for your bay. Security and waitstaff were rude, management didn't seem to care. Do yourself a favor and wipe this off your list for golf spots in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Really fun place.  

Regarding the golf you pay by the hour and, honestly, an hour is enough.  I'm a golfer and I'd had enough after about 45 minutes.  The games are pretty fun (I'd recommend Top Shot for a group) and the waitstaff was very good.  It's a little confusing the first time you go but after a bit you'll get the hang of it. 

We ate dinner in the restaurant downstairs and the food actually surprised me in it's quality. Very tasty, fast, and reasonably priced.  

It's not something I'd even attempt to go to on a weekend night as I can imagine it's a cluster@%@# but during the week, it's a nice spot for group outing."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time visiting this place (or even hitting a golf ball) and I already feel like a pro! $5 for a lifetime membership card that tracks your score, and depending on what time of the day you arrive, $25-45 per hour for a bay that can have up to 6 players. We got a bay with a couch which was REALLY nice. Everyone working there was friendly and helpful when showing us how to play. The balls have GPS inside that tracks where you hit them, and you get points based off of which target it goes into and where on the target. There are different \"games\" you can play but we only played the one the attendant set us up on. We ordered some cheese fries and they were delicious. The price of the food is a little higher than what you get, but its pretty understandable considering where you are. I'm stuck between being glad I don't live closer because I would sink my money into this place every weekend, and sad because I really wish I could enjoy it more often than I can. I wish Tucson had something like this, but we suck and only have bowling!"}
{"text":"It's become a regular for every Vegas trip to come here. A fun environment for all and especially those who love sports.

Plenty of TVs to catch your games, small gambling area and a pool up top. I think what I enjoy most is that the drink vouchers come out of the machines every so often and they're pretty good here. I enjoy the bloody Mary's here every time. Food is good, and they have a good sized menu to select.

As far as the actual driving range it's tons of fun. For those who are regular golfers, practicing and hitting into actual pods for points sounds fun. For those who aren't, it's fun attempting to hit the ball.

Go in the morning for the best deals, and the middle or lower level. I'd definitely recommend a solid 2 hours if you have a party of 4 or more who want to play consistently."}
{"text":"I am not big on golf but I had a great time. Going back next week to take my daughter to play."}
{"text":"Told the wait was going to be a hour and ended up leaving after over two hours of waiting. Checked with the front twice and staff didnt seem to care. Sad that we ended up leaving after waiting so long. We were really dissapointed with our whole experience. :("}
{"text":"I've been to Topgolf about 3 times now. I love going it is so much fun. Just being able to go with your friends and play a game at a \"driving range\" is fun. I love finding an excuse to go.

Yes I am raving about this place and only give it 4 stars. It's cause service is slow. If you don't order drinks right away, don't expect to see your server or any drinks for 10 minutes. Considering that people are paying by the hour 10 minutes is 15% of your time (if you are there for an hour). I usually go in the middle of the day, so I don't think its too crowded eithere to where this can be warranted. 

You don't really notice that when its your turn to hit, but if you are sitting there waiting for your turn, its nice to have a drink in hand."}
{"text":"Nothing like what I expected. Now I know why they always appeared packed! Went for my wife's birthday dinner. Ordered and were seated in the bar until our spot was open. Super cool how you rent for the hour and can hit as many balls as you like in that time. An hour is a perfect amount of time for everyone to get their golfness out and feel a little sore the next day. I don't remember which hamburger I got but it was the one with the egg on it. It was awesome. Fries were great. I would have gotten my hamburger a little more rare next time. Loved it though."}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype and I can foresee multiple locations in our area. As a non golfer one I picked the clubs up I didn't want to put them down"}
{"text":"Was so stoked when I found out this place was coming to Charlotte. Even if you are not a golfer this place is where it's at for a fun time. As soon as I walked through the door I was like a kid at Disneyworld. 

I started the evening at the bar for a drink as we waited for the rest of our party to arrive.  I will say that this place is always packed so be prepared to wait before you are able to enter the bay. If they build the new location in north Charlotte, I think that will help with the wait times. My recommendation until that happens would be to get the VIP pass so you can make a reservation. Hey, I am not complaining about the wait tho when you can have a drink at a bar. They also serve food here which I have not tried yet but hear it is pretty good.  Maybe next visit I will try some food.

Once we got in the golf bay on the upper deck ( they have a few levels) let the games begin. So many different games to play and for all skill levels.  The net is not too deep at 215 feet and the targets are fairly large. The  scoring is done by micro chip balls when they land in targets and the closer to the flag in the middle the more points. Those are the basic rules but don't worry because a friendly staff member will set you up when you arrive to the bay. They will explain and answer any questions. I noticed some would bring their entire set of golf clubs but I find that is a little aggressive perhaps. Personally I think the clubs they provide in the stations for both men and women are decent. They are graphite shafts and I prefer stiff flex steel shafts so next visit I will probable bring a couple clubs of my own. 

In case you can't tell, this place is awesome and will be back. I have been twice now but will tell you up front it is a little pricey but worth it. Best bet is get a group and split the cost of the bay rental. It is like 45 bucks for a hour after 5 and 25 before noon. 35 I think from the hours of 12-5. Then you get food and drinks and that is an expensive outing. 

Going during the day at cheaper rate is more my speed anyways as it gets really loud at night with the music and crowd. Almost feels like a club. Also, come here for the fun and not necessarily to work on your golf game- go to the range for that."}
{"text":"Having yet ANOTHER great day with friends and receiving top notch service from the entire staff but we must give a special shout out to MAE!  Thank you for your amazing service!!!!"}
{"text":"What a cool spot! My family and I had a few hours to kill before our flight home, so I decided to bring them to Topgolf. My mom recently took up golf as a pastime, and I thought this would be the perfect place for her. We parked our rental in their huge (uncovered) parking lot and made our way up the stairs to the lobby area. The prices were clearly marked behind the front desk, which varied depending on the amount of time spent playing, the floor chosen, and the time of day. 

We were only there for an hour on the 2nd of 3 floors after 12pm, and our price was $45 vs $60+ for the 3rd floor (21+ only). We had a runner greet us and bring us to our bay, where she showed us how to register each of our players into the computer system. The seating area was heated and had a great view of the Strip.

In our short time at Topgolf, we all had a blast and were able to enjoy some of their shareable plates and have a few drinks while we were at it. Everything came out relatively quickly, giving us just enough time to return our rental car and head to the airport. 

Tip: Review your bill carefully! You may want to base the gratuity on the total for your food and drinks only, minus the price for the game and any registration fees.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like TopGolf! This was my first time experiencing the place and it was absolutely amazing! We went knowing it would be packed and we might have to wait but going on a Saturday night (7ish) is probably not the best idea if you want to play. The place was super packed, cars lined down the street, and a wait of 2 hours....I was somewhat discouraged but, like I said, I was expecting this. Since we were visiting out of town we left and it actually worked out to our benefit because I got a text offer of $10 off since we weren't able to play.  We went back the next morning and the place was empty and wonderful. The game is great for anyone, even for my first timer wife and friends. We were able to do our own make shift brunch with their kitchen open and serving anything on the menu. The air was a little cool and they turned on these heaters that were amazing! You stay warm even though your outdoors! The service could have been better, hence the 4 stars. Our waiter seemed apathetic about serving and wasn't really attentive, but then again I was there for the golf!"}
{"text":"First time at this location! There was an hour wait, but when I was walking around, it looked like there were a lot of open bays so I went to the front to ask and a bay just so happen to open up... :/ The server was helpful and brought our food out on time. 

We tried the marguerite flatbread, chicken flatbread, chicken wings, nachos, and tacos. They were all really good! Some of the flatbread was a bit burnt though. And the chicken wings were a bit dry but other than that, it was fairly good! 

The games were around the same. The higher bays are always nicer and I guess for the Vegas location, more expensive. And if you want to golf at night, it cost more as well. Everything in Vegas cost more! - and thats not just a saying."}
{"text":"Wow! I had so much fun! There are 4 levels. Prices vary from $60-$90 per hour depending on time and day of the week. I went on a Saturday so it was pretty packed.  I visited levels 2-4. Level 1 is geared more towards families. Level 2 has corn hole, bar and live music. Level 3 has a really nice pool and lounging area. Level 4 has a nice view, pool and bar. It makes sense that the higher you go the more expensive it is, but I do think that the higher price is warranted for the extra goodies at each level. We ended up on level 2 for golfing and in the middle. I recommend that you have groups of 6 since that is the max per bay so that if you had the $60 price then it would be $10 per person. The middle has the least amount of view obstruction and you seem to have more options for targets to hit. You do not need to dress in \"golf attire\" like some people think. I saw people walking in with just bikini's and others dressed like they were ready to play 18 holes. It is very casual. I was wearing a dress and flip flops. We ordered a bunch of food and drinks too. I really liked the sea bass sliders for $15. I stopped by for my birthday and I believe they should offer a free dessert on birthdays! The Alcohol infused donuts are a bit odd, but also delicious. It would be nice if you could reserve ahead of time online or have an idea of how packed it is before stopping by. Oh and make sure you ask for proper golf grip and hold on to your clubs. I saw a few down on the course."}
{"text":"Great experience. Found a coupon on Vegas.com and they honored it. The only thing I can say is that's it's tooo FAR to walk, it's NOT inside The MGM it's a whole different building to the back of MGM. We walked from the Mandalay Bay to the MGM and oh my gosh it was far. Again some people might be ok with that but it wasn't for us.

Lots of fun. Will definitely be back but we'll Uber , drive ourselves or use their shuttle next time."}
{"text":"It can get busy but it is so fun. I was pregnant last time we went and they made sure to give us a spot with a couch. It was greatly appreciated. :)"}
{"text":"Awesome time. I told to go here by a Chris k from the Scottsdale location and my family had a great time in a relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is pretty badass. Went Ina Saturday night with some buddies on a few day visit to the area. It was lovely like a club or jumping bar, complete with a Dj on the top driving level. You basically play like you would bowling- take turns and there's specific targets and challenges. There's clubs to use and you get your own little booth area which is chill.  They had corn hole out on the deck as well. Nice bonus. 

My only complaint was the service. There was four of us, and we got there at like 11-1130 and it was not that busy. We still waited about 15 minutes before our guy came by. Took another 10+ minutes to get a pitcher of beers (Summer shandy) and shots of Grand Marnier. First the guy splashed / spilled our shots as he put them down and made effort to clean it up or get another to compensate. Typically GM shots are not cheap, so that was a not cool. The Shandys were on special for $3, so one would figure that getting a pitcher, which is exactly 4 beers, would be a discount from that. But no, it was $13. Not a huge deal, but when the bill came and I noticed it and asked the guy, he responded with \"oh well yea that's the normal price for pitchers\". I asked then what's the point of getting a pitcher if it costs more? Why didn't you tell us that?\" He had no answer for that. I've been a bartender for 13 years, so that irks me that he basically didn't feel the need to inform us of that when he clearly knew.  He also was MIA half the time, despite there only being a couple of groups still playing. 
Other than that, we got a plate of steak nachos that were phenomenal. In all, two pitchers, 4 shots and the nachos cost $75. Not too bad. 
Fun time over all. Definitely a fun spot for a group, bday, etc. I suck at golf and still had fun blasting shots off the deck."}
{"text":"Went here to see Soul Asylum last night. Cool looking place.Went to bar on Third floor. The bartenders were so painfully slow. It could be that they didn't know where anything was,first time using the computer,had never had a crowd, Im not sure,it could be all of the above. As a bartender,it was painful to watch. Service at 2nd floor bar was a bit better. At least they looked like they were trying. I'm not sure why two vodka drinks were $22 at one bar and $17 and change at another. I'm 99% sure I was up sold without asking. I'm not a fan of that hustle. 

The facility was new and very nice. I like the set up for the show,we stood just a few feet from the stage.

All in all, I wouldn't come back on purpose"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for Top Golf based on my husbands experience at the Las Vegas location. Unfortunately, Top Golf Charlotte let me down. This location is 1) Disorganized (besides the fact the staff looks like they don't know what's going on, they verbally confirmed they didn't know what was going on) and 2) Unprofessional (it appears they have no training or expectations on the customer service level they expect out of their staff i.e. not attentive, wrong items brought to us, SLOW service, heard the concierge service argue with the booth host who should explain the rules once we got into the booth= Pathetic). Why spend your hard earned money here when you can go to another driving range? NOT WORTH IT."}
{"text":"They need to get their parking situation in order. Especially staff. Staff needs to be trained on letting guests know there is a shuttle provided that will pick them up 2 blocks away at the mgm. 

Staff member didnt advise us that they share a parking deck with mgm, and that they have a shuttle to pick us up. Instead we walked 2 blocked in a 107 degree weather with a baby. 

Top golf also failed to communicatw with one another. Security sent us to mgm and their staff inside said there is plenty of parking. 

Prices are higher here. 

Worst expwrience ever."}
{"text":"My friends and I always have a good time when we come since we're locals- our host DJ always sets us up. 
It's a nice low key spot if you want to have a few drinks and good food while working on your swing, I've heard the line can be some what of a wait (2+hrs) so if you have a group of 5 or more I'd suggest just everyone pitching in and getting the cabana area on the 3rd level. My favorite server would have to be Andi she was super sweet and always came to check up on us to see if we were OK. The BBQ platter is a must try and seasonal parfait is a great dessert item too! But the best dessert is the injectable cinnamon ball things, they can get messy but worth it. Security can be a little touchy but I guess they kind of have to be up tight since there's alcohol involved balls and metal clubs..."}
{"text":"This place is like mini-golfing on steroids! The great thing about top golf is that you don't even have to be a great golfer to enjoy this type of golfing! It's like playing darts with a golf club. Each time I've been here (whether it's 1pm or 6pm) it's been relatively packed, wait time can range from 5minutes to an hour and a half. The good thing is that there's a bar to kill time while you wait for your bay to open (they'll send you a text alert once your bays available). The food here is decent at best-stick with their sliders if you know what's best for you."}
{"text":"This was our 3rd or 4th visit for family birthday event. Great venue for a group of all ages. Good food with lots of interesting options for culinary curious/adventurous and plenty for the finicky foodies. Our server Heather was friendly and attentive. Manager Chris was helpful in coordinating a special request for our group. We appreciate the alternative entertainment like foosball, billiards, shuffleboard and video games for the younger members. Would like to see more cornhole to entertain those not in the golf bay.  We have been here before and absolutely will be back."}
{"text":"As I said in my tip. I'm kinda having my doubts. The place is beautiful, the staff are nice. But, I give it three stars for organizational skills. Meaning the web site and phone recorder says no reservations bullsh$&!!! But, when you get past it all, it's like a fine working clock works for some reason. Throughout the chaos and the mayhem things all fit together as one.

Thank god we ran into Beverly, she was a god send, she was very organized, friendly and most of all patent. It was nice getting an explanation from someone so gifted as her. 

Once you get through the queue nightmare it really is very nice. A beautiful dining / bar area. Very nice bartenders who sling a premium drink. After an hour away, which wasn't too long considering we were sitting at the bar and having drinks, we were texting to go to the concierge for our position on the course.
Once you get there I host it takes you to the course and explained everything to you so you know it backwards and forwards, and then explains the games. He did a great job. The games are great a lot of fun Lotta good fun competition and I recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"It's a cool place, but not worth visiting more than once. It's a pretty place and unique in its build. There's lively music and really cool lights, but it's too crowded - and that's something I don't like. There isn't any parking and you have to wait at least 1-3 hours for a bay that reaks like cigarette smoke. I got bored after a while too because I already knew I wouldn't make it into the farthest hole and win $1,000. LOL."}
{"text":"Chain golf experience located in Las Vegas right off the strip.

This place is very busy and you will likely have to wait for a golf bay. You give your phone number at the front and they call you when your bay is ready. 

There are several indoor and outdoor bars as well as a random pool on the second level. You can get food and drinks at the bar as well as your golf bay.

Prices to play are by the hour and one price for the bay, not by person. You don't have to pay until you are done and you have the option of extending your time on the computer screen in the bay.

Men's and women's clubs are provided in the bay. There are several targets to shoot for and points are awarded for the targets.

The experience is on the pricey side but it was super fun."}
{"text":"Love it! Definitely worth the money, such a fun concept and I've never even golfed before! Service was great in the Bay Area but really really slow in the restaurant/bar area. The host said that today was the first day in months where they weren't on a 3 hour wait so would probably make reservations if they accept them. Definitely returning with friends next time!"}
{"text":"Update:

After this review was posted, I was contacted by Top Golf to learn more about what happened during my son's birthday. After going over the details in depth, we were invited back for a redo of his party. Since it was at the end of the school year/beginning of summer, we had a super hard time getting everyone together. I finally contacted them back about getting it scheduled totally last minute on my part, but they made it happen. We went and they treated my son (and us) like a prince. We all had a fabulous time. 

Now, I have never once changed my star rating based on a second chance gifted to me. I feel like a lot of times these second chances are a bit contrived and not what the average person can expect. The reason I did this time is that I truly feel that the company went above and beyond because they want ALL guests to have a great experience and try to make it right when they don't. Also, most of the people we came into contact with had no idea that we were back by invitation from corporate. They were just treating us the way that they treat all guests, which is great. I would not hesitate to recommend anyone to check them out. They care about their customers and that's really all it takes.

Original review: 

I have such mixed feelings about this place. We have been here 3 different times. The first time we were here we had a really good time golfing, but a not so great experience with our server. He was intrusive and irritated when we told him that we would be golfing and then heading in to eat dinner at a table. It was a little uncomfortable, but we brushed it off.

Since we had such a great time golfing, my son wanted to celebrate his 7th birthday by going there with a couple of his friends. The kids had a wonderful time, but our waiter was atrocious. He was really inappropriate from the get go. We (the parents) ordered beers and he sat and remarked about each of our ages in relation to his own for an awkward amount of time. He also made odd comments, including a super offensive one about them being \"retardedly\" busy. He continually forgot orders, and I continually had to call him over to remind him and repeat myself over and over. This was so bad that I couldn't engage with son as much as I would like to. After the incident, I tried calling Top Golf to complain and Was put on hold for about 15 minutes only to be told to email them. I emailed them and got no response. 

We came here a third time just a few days after the party on my sons actual birthday for a quick hour of golfing in the morning. It was just my son, my husband, and I that day and it wasn't busy at all. Our waiter was amazing, which is really the only reason for the second star.

I really like playing at Top Golf, but the waiter situation is really off-putting. It was downright uncomfortable twice, which is not ok when you are spending at least a hundred bucks, if not more. The worst part is that the Top Golf management doesn't even care enough to respond to complaints. Oh"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It takes your traditional driving range to the next level by making a game out of it, using computer-chipped balls to keep score. It's really not unfairly-priced, either, when you factor in the fun! The easiest thing to equate the experience to is going bowling, except the facilities are way better than about 99% of the bowling alleys I've been to (and I've been to a lot of bowling alleys. Ha!).

We stopped in just to see what it was about, and figured we'd play for an hour. Instead, we stayed for THREE hours. The fact that it's also a full service sports bar/restaurant with decent food and TV's at every bay where you can control the games you want to watch, makes it an incredibly easy way to spend a few hours. Especially during the NFL season when NFL Sunday Ticket is nice to have at your disposal.

The golfing aspect is cool. I didn't bring my clubs on our trip, so it's nice that TopGolf offers their own assortment of clubs. They're color-coded for men's and women's and the provide great visual references for people unfamiliar with the ranges of clubs, etc. The touchscreen controls for adding time and increasing your card balance is a bit confusing, but it's still fun and the ease-of-use makes extending your play easy (perhaps TOO easy!). Luckily, the staff is incredibly helpful if you have questions on how to use the system. The only complaint some may have is that TopGolf doesn't allow you to swap the tee height, nor do they allow players to bring in their own drivers or hybrids. Apparently, this is to help keep the balls in play, as pre-rule, people spent more time trying to hit the ball out of the range than playing the actual game, itself, and the ability to get under the ball meant a lot of chasing beyond the nets. Once our waiter explained that, I basically stuck to the irons and their 3-hybrid the rest of the day. You ARE allowed to bring your own irons in, though, which is cool, but the clubs they provide are perfectly fine and don't take away from the enjoyment at all. I did find that I didn't get quite as much distance from their clubs as I'm used to, but after a few swings, I simply adjusted to the lack of distance. Also, once you link up your account on their site, you can see your game history, progress, etc. It's a pretty cool!

The food was good. Better than I expected, honestly. We just got a quesadilla, and I got the turkey avocado wrap. The quesadilla was pretty standard, but the wrap was good. Tons of avocado, which I loved! I also downed 3 Texas Mules, which were also good (sorry, no copper mugs here). I'd equate the food to something like Chili's, which is what it is. Perfectly suitable for a golfing/sports bar/drinking experience.

As alluded to briefly, the staff was excellent. Our server (more like all-in-one TopGolf concierge/waiter/pro) was attentive, quick to answer any questions we had and always made sure our waters were topped off, our drinks were replenished and continually checked in to make sure everything was good with our experience. 

If I ever find myself back in the Phoenix area, I'll most definitely return. Besides, it would be nice to use the lifetime membership card that they make you buy for $5 again. The one thing to note is that they have 60 bays to play from, but the lines got really long once 11-12 PM rolled around. We got there closer to opening and had no issue getting in, but I can imagine this place gets packed later in the day. Like a regular course, it's nice to get out there early! Although, we hear their nighttime experience is cool.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great place to come and have a good time!!!! Heard about this place a fewl the ago. Highly recommend it to anyone that loves to play golf and be competitive!! Great service and the food was amazing!! Nice vibe to Scottsdale Arizona! It was my brothers birthday and it was awesome. Our server Ian was perfect and provided great service!!! Please visit this place, I promise you'll have a great time at Top Golf!!!!"}
{"text":"What a BLAST.  This was my second time there and it was just as much fun.  You don't have to be a golfer to enjoy this experience.  Service is excellent food and drink were well above average and the golf games are a lot of fun.  Will be back many, many more times"}
{"text":"Best Friday afternoon work outing EVER. I was lucky enough to visit Topgolf on a Friday afternoon this week with some coworkers, and we had such a great time! 

The taco buffet we had for lunch was really tasty - I highly recommend this menu choice for others looking to have a dining experience with a larger group (we had around 25 people altogether). We had plenty of food (chicken and beef, soft taco shells, rice, beans, chips and salsa, non-alcoholic bevvies), and everything was really flavorful, which to me is impressive given that most people probably don't come to Topgolf solely to chow down. 

I can see why this place gets so crowded -- like previous reviewers have mentioned, it feels like going to a bowling alley, but... you're golfing (or attempting to, in my case!). It's a great atmosphere to come with a group for a special occasion. 

Every staff member we met was very friendly and helpful - very much appreciate this as we were all first-timers. 

Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Lots of fun. Very busy so plan to wait a bit on weekends but they have huge TVs to watch sports while you wait."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Topgolf... There are definitely many pros but there are cons as well.
I'll tell you both.
The parking situation is terrible. If I was not here for date with the Mr, once experiencing the ridiculous parking situation, I would just go elsewhere. BUT as Topgolf put a dent in my vibe, I did not want to ruin the vibe for my honey so I kept it together. The parking lot is under construction so there is NO parking there. You have an option of parking at the MGM, which is a 0.5 mile walk OR attempt utilizing the valet which will likely be full, as it was for us. A chance for valet being full is pretty high since they are only able to take about 10 cars and the only other option is 0.5 mile away. So, dressed for date night, I had to walk 0.5 miles in 100 degree weather AND pay for parking at MGM. As much as Topgolf charges, it's unacceptable. There is a shuttle running between Topgolf and MGM but there are no signs anything else letting you know where it is or that it's even available, so good luck finding it.
After having my soul irritated by the parking situation and walking from MGM, we came inside to be treated by very friendly staff. Straight from the door smiling faces were saying hello and directing us where to go. 
There are different levels with different pricing. Levels 1 &2  are $15 cheaper and cater more to families. Level 3 is 21+, has a bar, and better views. We opted for level 3 ($75/hr on a Monday). Each section has a leather sectional with some throw pillows and a table. Cool vibe. We ordered some food and drinks which were pretty good but I found to be a bit pricey. The Mr. ordered a wing app that came with 6 wings that carried a $13 price tag... 
I am not a golf player so this was a pretty new experience for me. There were several club options which were divided between men's (left) and women's (right) sections. After trying out a few clubs, i found the right one for me and actually scored some points! Who knew golf can be fun? Or may be golf + cocktails is fun? Either way, we had a blast! 
The concept of Topgolf is awesome. I just feel that at this price tag they should take better care of their customers, even with parking lot issues, it could have been better managed/organized."}
{"text":"Golf, Darts and Bowling all in one!

We went to Top Golf with some friends while we were attending Spring Training. We had a free day and decided to make a reservation and try it since last year, with no reservation, we could not get in because it was such a busy popular place. Our wives have never touched a golf club in their lives and were content to just have some Bloody Mary's and watch us play but we convinced them, with the assistance of our waitress, to just have fun and enjoy the day. They were both beaming with smiles and laughs a plenty with in the first ten minutes of playing.
It's like golf for obvious reasons, it's like darts because the targets have bulls eyes with an inner ring and outer rings and it's like bowling because you all take turns and compete individually or as teams.
Our waitress was amazing, after checking in, they text you which bay to report to and your waitress meets you there to get you checked in and give you a tutorial. She then takes your drink and food orders and then it becomes really fun. You rent the bay by the hour and you are prompted when your time is running out and you then have the option to play out your time or add more time. The girls who did not want to play at all then wanted to extend our time and before we knew it, we were there three hours.
For the three hours, adult beverages and food for four, we were into it for about $200 for the entire group.
There were people all around us of varying ages and abilities and they were all having a really good time. My wife was talking about how much fun she had all day and said she could not wait until Spring Training next year to do it again. They are building another facility over in Glendale, right on the other side of the freeway from the football stadium. We saw it under construction while driving back and forth to Spring Training games. So, I hope that relieves some of the popularity and will make it more receptive to walking in.
This is a great activity to do with your entire family!"}
{"text":"Great layout and concept. Just quite pricey. Come in groups to reduce costs per person. There's various games you can play."}
{"text":"I'm having a hard time rating  Topgolf in Las Vegas. The same time last year I hosted a group of clients and had a great time. This year on 7/1, took out the same clients, had a wonderful time again. They treated us well and our service was awesome. My brother-in-law was in town as well and I recommend Topgolf for a family outing and we went back on 7/6, great time again. Now here is the problem, my wife and I own a dance studio, we are in Las Vegas to compete at a National Dance Competition. We wanted to celebrate with our instructors on a successful week of competition. They all wanted to go TopGolf because they've been hearing great things about it and  it is connected to the MGM where we were staying. On 7/7 @ 9PM we had a reservation for seven or eight people. When we arrived our hostess/waitress wasn't very friendly, not rude but not what I experienced from other hostess on prior visits. She didn't explain anything to our instructors or how things worked with the games. Maybe we caught her on a off night, but whatever, we were there to have a good time. We ordered food and drinks, everything at the start is fine, but I notice our waitress ignoring our group as she walked by multiple times even when they raised their hands to get her attention. My instructors had to start moving plates/glasses and cleaning the table for themselves and trying to find something to wipe their hand on before they pick up a club when it was their turn to hit because there were no napkins on the table ( btw most of Topgolf's menu is finger foods) and she hadn't checked on our party in a very long time. The place wasn't particularly busy that night but still empty bottles, plates, and drinks weren't being cleared off our area. So when she walked by and didn't see our people call to her again, that was it. I pulled her aside and told her she sucked at waitressing and I wanted a new waitress. She of course didn't understand why, so I told her about her lack of service but I also wasn't in the mood to argue so I just I wanted another waitress and to see her manager. A new waitress came but no manager??? The service improved though. Ok good, back to having a good time... as long as my people were having fun, not getting the manger involved I would let pass. When it came to settle the bill, to my surprise the old waitress wanted close us out. Alright, maybe she started the process and the billing system needed her to close the ticket. On the bill I wrote the $100 gratuity goes to the new waitress that gave us great service. Immediately after she ran my ticket she had one of the other employees shut down our game without giving us warning. As far as our group's behavior, we were mild, fun loving, polite as they come. So it was the most bizarre scenario. I directly went and talked to George Kalianiotis the Team Lead and Tiffany Hietbrink the Hospitality Manager about the actions of their vengeful waitress. To both their credit they really tried to make the situation better. But the damage was done and ended our celebratory night at Topgolf on a sour note. By no means am I high roller but if you drop close to $1000 in couple hours you should get at least the same service that you would get from an IHOP. Tiffany and George both gave me their personal card, refunded me back $150 and promised to treat our party right the next time we're in town. I will hold them up to that promise and change my rating then to 5 stars which they deserve except for the action of a waitress having a off night.

{"text":"I'm not really into golf at all, but its a nice looking place . now if you put the address in google it will take you to the Hilton parking lot. But take the parking lot exit and you will find yourself in their parking lot of top golf. Now the drinks are cheap here real cheap if you come with groups. Shots , beer all good but I did not their food. The driving range is pretty cool, it has a nice view of talking stick so at night you get a light show. It's not to loud, they place nice pop music and over all the place looks pretty"}
{"text":"It saddens me to leave such a harsh review but here we go!

Ill start off with the good. The concept of top golf is awesome! Glowing golf driving range over drinks ... Who wouldn't want to go? 

Nevertheless, the staff was trained poorly. We were told it would be an hour wait (which was fine since it was a busy night). In the meantime we thought to grab a bite to eat and some drinks. We go to the bar upstairs, as directed, and were not acknowledged once by the bartender. I gave the benefit of the doubt being that it was a busy night. We go downstairs and before sitting, I ask the bartender if it's okay to order food at the bar as well. She gladly agreed. After 15 or so she comes to take our order but claims she is only taking our drinks order at this time. I politely decline as I stated originally that I'm here to order some food. She didn't seem too happy but it could've been due to the fact that the bar got busy in a matter of minutes. 

Now it's time for us to go to our bay. I ask the guy at concierge for clubs because I am left handed and they don't normally have left handed clubs out. He provides a smart a** comment saying \"have you really been here before?\" Ummm yes I have but again I'm left handed so I need some clubs suitable for me .. He didn't realize that's why I asked and seemed embarrassed after 

Finally it's time to golf! Our waitress upstairs was soo friendly. However they forgot to add the shots in our drink order. They brought over shots to stir in our drinks but She wasn't sure which shot had which so she  proceeded to smell the glass. A nose in a drink is not what i would prefer for a cocktail. I can't stress enough .. Top golf can be a great place for a fun night but I highly recommend more training for staff"}
{"text":"My wife brought me here for my birthday we where told it would be a 4 hour wait. Then as we tried to check in the people managing the line told other people to jump in front of me checking in. When we came back from waiting 3 hours we tried to order drinks and nobody at the bar would aknowledge us. I don't know if there's take this way all the time I guess it's because it's new but the staff did say it's been a minimum of a 2 hour wait since opening. I found it very poor service and management overall."}
{"text":"Great times with friends last night.  Wish it would have lasted longer.  Can't wait till next time."}
{"text":"Located adjacent to the MGM Grand on the Famous Las Vegas Strip! Holy Mackerel this place is a massive spectacle, that is the latest must do in Las Vegas! 4 levels for golf! 2 pools and more bars than can be counted. The food is fantastic, the staff helpful and friendly. As I said before this is a must do and must be seen to be believed! So go see and go believe! Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"I've been to TopGolf twice now and both times were a blast! They have a great setup with multiple floors to drive from. I'm not a big golfer, so I really enjoyed the aspect of an expanded hole with weighted points the closer you get to the center. I equate it to a combination between a driving range and darts. The food/drinks are also on point here and the staff is attentive/helpful. It's a great place to hold a party or get together with some friends.

To play, you need to purchase a $5 card, but it's for lifetime membership so it's a total steal! They also have numerous contests and prizes based on how well you score.

Take it from me: You don't have to love golf to love TopGolf!"}
{"text":"Not sure what their problem is but it's always hot inside, 82*. The first time I thought it was because it was over occupied due to a dust storm outside, but that's not the case. The service is pretty horrible also, probably because they have the same people covering tables inside covering the tables outside. And you would think paying what you do to drive some balls they could afford to replace the chewed up tees. I'm over it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! This was my first time here! Basically, you rent a \"tee area\" with comfortable seating and a table at an hourly rate (in 30 minute increments after the first hour), for up to 6 people, I think. Once your hour starts, you can play a variety of golf games, aiming for the scoring holes. Each hole is divided into different scoring values; closer to the center gets more points most of the time.
The food is good, the service is great! This can be a fun evening for your group."}
{"text":"After receiving an immediate response from Top Golf management, Trisha, I decided to give my experience one more try. Trisha offered my friends and I an opportunity to try top golf once more. We were able to go back to top golf on a Saturday night and another manager, Scott, made sure we were taken care of. We did not experience any additional technical issues while we were playing and the service was great. I am so glad I gave them another try, and I will be back for sure! Thank you Scott and Trisha."}
{"text":"This place is as advertised! When i first pulled in off the Exit, i was blown away by the size of the facility.  Inside they have a fully stocked bar with all the regular spirits and a variety of local beers on tap.  I went with their \"Tipsy Palmer\" (obviously a stiff Arnold Palmer), which was perfect in the heat.

I was there for a soft open, so they rolled out a few apps for us.  The \"Mushi\" was my favorite. It had shredded chicken, mixed with sticky rice, avocado, cheese, sour cream, cilantro, beans, Sriracha in a jalapeño tortilla  wrap.  I also tried the cocktail shrimp, which was very solid!

For dessert, they brought out \"Injectable Donut Holes\"...yes, that's as good as it sounds!  You pick between 3 flavors: chocolate, raspberry jelly and my favorite, Bavarian Cream.  This is a must try! 

Think of this place as one of the coolest bowling alleys you've been to....except for golf.  Perfect setup for 4-8 people (more if you double up cubes) to hit some balls, they have games you can play as a group, eat, drink, also plenty of Tv's for big sporting events.

My only concern for this place is that they will be to popular!"}
{"text":"It's hard not to love Top Golf. It's been a long time since I've been to Top Golf, but we recently returned with friends and had a nice afternoon. You don't have to love golf or even have ever held a club to enjoy yourself.

Top Golf only takes reservations for large parties so plan accordingly. We decided to go at 11:30 on a Sunday morning hoping to beat the crowds and it worked. To our surprise we found out that the pricing increases at noon so we saved money trying to beat the crowds. We also found out that there is a discount for locals. 

This is the Vegas location so everything is larger and better. There are two pools, multiple bars, a TV screen that covers a large wall, and games like shuffleboard.

Our host was great. She came by right away to get our drink orders. Then it was on to food and she continued to check in on us. As soon as we would finish food someone would come by to remove the dirty plate. Drinks were refilled quickly too. The service was very friendly and attentive.

The food and drink menu is large and offers something for everyone. All of the food I've had has been good too. On our recent visit we ordered the Deviled Egg Sampler, Sweet Crispy Shrimp, & Jumbo Pretzel Board. The deviled eggs were great, we loved the steak and bacon that topped the eggs. The shrimp was fine, but not exciting enough to order again. The pretzel board was awesome with a little bit of everything. There was cheese, meat, fruit, candied nuts, cheese sauce, and mustard all nested in the giant pretzel. Everything was delicious and it was good for sharing. We needed a sweet ending so we ordered the Injectable Donut Holes. They seemed like the only item that was truly good for sharing. The donuts were delicious and there were plenty of them. The sauces were great, but the injectors were prone to getting stuck and a little messy."}
{"text":"Wow, what an unbelievable place!  I wasn't sure how a place like this would work in Gilbert, but based on the crowds last night, I think they've found an itch that needed scratching out here in the East Valley!  We went with a few friends, and were greeted by some of the nicest people you'll find in Phoenix.  Laughing, dancing, getting everybody involved in the action from the get go.  We had a wait (which is actually part of the fun), so we headed over to the bar for a few drinks.

This place is loaded with TV's and may be my new hangout when football season comes back around!  Tons of beers on tap, great selection of cocktails, and a drink served in a glass golf bag that requires three people to order.  Watch the booze go in, people, you'll know why!

After a bit of a wait, we headed to the bay for some golf.  WOW!  Such a cool experience, and the non-golfers of the group had just as much fun as we did!  Music was pumping, we could watch TV right there, and they brought the food right to our bay so when you weren't hitting, you could chat, drink, and eat without skipping a beat.  The food was fantastic too!  Not something you'd expect to find, but it was top-notch fare at a darn good price (places like this can sometimes be spendy, but it was very reasonable for what you get).

Let's put it this way: if there's a place that gets my wife to play golf, and I can drink beer and watch football while doing it, I'm on board!  Go check it out!"}
{"text":"The idea behind Topgolf is awesome, but the execution is lacking. We came in on a Saturday night, so we were expecting a wait but when we were told 3 hours at 8pm I felt that that was a bit excessive. But I was super excited, so we decided to wait it out. We sat in the bar area on the main floor which was very crowded and lively-had a good vibe! It took a while for someone to come up to us, a few different waitresses kept asking if we had been helped yet and we said no still to not have anyone come actually take an order for about 10 minutes. Fortunately, we didn't mind because we were waiting for another couple to join us. In the meantime, we ordered drinks from the bar(got id'd which is fine....once) but then throughout the rest of the night we all had to show our ids about 3-4 more times to different people even though we clearly had drinks and had already been ID'd. But that was the least of my concerns throughout the night 
When our friends got there, they had just sat down, took off their coats and a waiter going by spilt old, eaten food all over our friend and his jacket. He barely received an apology and had to persuade someone who was the manager I'm guessing who finally came over to give him an appetizer on the house(in my opinion should have been offered right away). 
Our waitress was not very attentive and in the middle of my order pulled out her cellphone. I was blown away. Being in the restaurant business for a long time, I have never seen anyone do this at a table! And as soon as that happened, I knew that our order was going to be messed up(on top of being on her phone, she wasn't writing anything down). And big surprise, our orders came out all messed up. So needless to say, we were not happy. 
We had to send one plate back and by the time it came back out we were moving outside to start playing golf. I will say, once we got out there, our experience at Topgolf improved tenfold! We had a fantastic waitress and it was much warmer outside than it was inside. 
Overall, I really like the idea of Topgolf, but unfortunately most of our experience was ruined by some of the staff and how inattentive they were."}
{"text":"My husband and I went and we had a lot of fun. If you went with another couple or more I can see how it would be a blast. Well worth the money in our opinion and I think it will be on our list of things to do whenever in Vegas. It may have been a bit confusing on how to work the computer scoring at first but the people that work there are very willing to explain and help. It may seem a bit pricey but believe me it's worth it and more fun then losing your money in the casino."}
{"text":"So much fun! Went in with a few friends for my husbands birthday. We got drinks and the servers were pretty upbeat and checked in on us regularly to see if we needed anything! One of the gentlemen that sat us down explained everything to us since we were first timers and was very informative!

The view and atmosphere was so much fun! Had a total blast and I would definitely do it again! Friendly and efficient staff! The only thing was that we had about a 2 hour wait but it was worth it! Next time I'm thinking about checking in, in advance and then going and grabbing dinner while waiting for a table!"}
{"text":"We recently went here for my best friends 21st birthday and I must say it was not a traditional 21st. It was way more fun than that! We had an unbelievably good time there. The Pineapple Express is absolutely amazing, and it's and awesome drink for those who hate the taste of alcohol, aka me. The waitress and waiter were absolutely both amazing. They were so accommodating, sweet and lively! They made the day more special with a song dedicated to our birthday girl! Thank you guys so much. 

I might add though, some people and the front aren't as friendly as I would have liked, the girl at the front desk was kind of into getting me out of her face more than talking, and it's not because there was a wait, there wasn't one. BESIDES THAT, everything was fantastic, if you do plants come here, intend to spend some money, but that's what fun is for! It's so much fun hitting the golf balls, whether you're bad like me, or experienced. AND PLEASE TIP YOUR SERVERS 20%. :)  thanks!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience at Top Golf. Our server Dan Shafer was the man, helped us set everything up, was spot on with the drinks and didn't rush us at all. Highly recommend for work functions."}
{"text":"The experience of golfing off the edge was fantastic and fun but my disappointment comes mainly from the staff. Our waitress never returned so we ended up going to the bar to order a drink. Then the continued immaturity from the staff was ridiculous. Staff were chasing each other around the bathrooms/restaurant area flirting constantly. Then towards the end when we were leaving, they were goofing around behind the bar that ended up in a glass being broken. Did they handle that professionally? Nope. They started creating more of a scene than was necessary at all. One of the younger guys was d*cking around with the bartender very loudly saying, \"what the f*ck did you do that for, it's all your fault!\" In a joking and completely unprofessional way. All customers were looking at them by this time and instead of apologize for the interruption they continued to goof around and curse behind the bar. For the $50 an hour that they charge to golf, I'm shocked that there was no management or maturity among the staff. Extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"The pool and awesome bartender John Hogan are located on the 3rd floor. Food is more upscale than traditional Tops Golf locations! Try the Crispy Rock Shrimp, Crispy Sea Bass Sliders, and Grilled Steak Pitas"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fun experience with your coworkers, this is a pretty good choice. 

Our team building was worthwhile here, thanks to drinks and some hilarious drives. 

Service was good. No issues flagging down our waitress when we needed some more drinks. She was very helpful and cool. 

The food? I took away a star just for the dry, lackluster food. We had the Thai chicken satay skewers and chicken pot stickers as appetizers. For the main course, there was the pickle fried chicken, beef brisket, green chili mac and cheese, beans, house salad with rolls. 

All of it was pretty blasé. The clear winner of the night was the beef brisket. And if we're going to talk about winners, we might as well touch on the loser, which was the green chili mac and cheese. Holy crap. It was unnecessarily dry and had very little flavor. It certainly didn't taste like any sort of chili, green or otherwise.

Aside from that, the location is easy to get to off the freeway and it's a little pricey, but it's an awful lot of fun when your target lights up at night!"}
{"text":"I had a great time at Top Golf - I had no idea it was a game and not just a fancy driving range. 

Great for an afternoon outside"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect, but it was actually a lot of fun.  I will bring my own clubs next time, as I didn't like the graphite shafts on theirs.  The games were a lot of fun to play.  It was like playing the Tiger Woods Golf video game on the target shooting except in real life.
We went up to the 3rd floor to get a different view when taking our shots.  Will probably stay that high again next time.  Lots of food and drinks.  Very much like a party atmosphere.  I bet company parties would be a blast here.
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because we had quite a bit of trouble getting some of the balls to register after we hit them and to correct the score took a lot of time, which you don't have any to waste since you pay by the hour.  A couple of associates came by to try and help, but couldn't and only wasted more time.  The last one said he would get a manager, they he never came back.  Other than that it was awesome.
I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really great place however BEWARE OF YOUR BILL!!!!!.  While we waited we had coffee and a shot of Baileys.  Our son added a second shot and the bartender tried to charge me an extra 5.oo on the second shot.  T^hen our bill for the food and drinks we got in our booth was wrong as well and we ha to have the waitress correct it as well. ... Over all, we had a blast.  It is a great place to hang out with friends, just don't like being taken advantage of."}
{"text":"I have been anxiously waiting for TopGolf to open that I ended up going a few days before they officially opened. It's bowling meets golf. Since it was opening week, they were still working out kinks. Other than programming the right time of play everything was fine. We were on the very far right end which made it harder to target the bays that were to the left of me. The ones that were straight in front of me were really far. After our hour was up we ate food at our table and I felt like they were rushing us out. My only suggestion is that you pay per game. Golf isn't something you normally rush. And if people are eating and drinking in between than it's harder to enjoy the experience if there's a time limit. It's also a bit pricey if you go at night. The only good way to do TopGolf for cheaper is if you get more people to play. I believe the max is 6 per bay but you'll probably need 2 hours. Another complaint I have is they have a driver that you can use but you can't even use it because the tee doesn't adjust height at all. I wish they had the tees like they have at Leatherman that automatically tees the ball for you and you can adjust the height.

Came back again a month after opening and it seems they still don't have their kinks worked out. Some of the employees seem lost still. We were playing at our bay and a host asked if we were using it as we were swinging. Also, I told the guy when we first walked in that we had a $10 off coupon. Before we played noticed that they didn't apply it. Apparently you're supposed to wait in a different line if you have a coupon. Also we arrived with enough time to play before the rates went up but with the long waiting time we had to pay the higher hourly rate. There's nowhere to really wait unless you want to eat while you wait. The lobby is too full to wait in and the two pool tables were always in use. Luckily it wasn't busy in the dining area and the server graciously let us sit while we waited. It also would've been nice if the host that told us we had a long wait let us know that there's a place we could store our clubs. We noticed this room as we were looking for a place to wait and asked someone about it. Also, half of the parking lot was empty as it was reserved for valet parking. Cars were parked all along the driveway even though there were so many empty spots but you had to pay for those."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Topgolf. This is the coolest hangout in Vegas. The driving range is awesome. There are three (maybe four) levels, and there are different games you can play with your group. You'll have a server to bring you food and drinks at your request. Drinks are a little pricey, but food it pretty reasonably priced. Aside from the range, there are a few bars in this place. They even have two swimming pools. There's cornhole, shuffle board, and TONS of TV's and projectors. It's likely there will be a wait, so they've made sure there is plenty to keep yourself entertained while you wait. Make sure you sign up for a membership while you're there. It'll give you 20% off your visits. Attire is pretty much whatever you like. Casual is fine, or if you plan to hit the night life afterwards, there are plenty of people here in club attire. I highly recommend you check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Very expensive to play golf.  Getting card etc. lame. We went because you can't reserve and had wait time on a Sunday for hour and half. Lame. Hopefully can get in to play sooner next time."}
{"text":"Top golf is very fun, food was okay, service was slow but they were really busy so that was expected(opening weekend) One star is for the valet company they use! After a night of fun, valet retrieved my car. Right when we saw my car I, the owner of the car, my boyfriend and my dad all saw a dent in my driver side door that was not there. It was like it was opened on a pole or something. We notified valet and conveniently my car was parked right next to the owners \"brand new car with nothing wrong on it\". Owner said he would look at the video (on the 11th) and reach back out but the end of the day. After no update I finally reached out on the 14th for one. Said he would be sending a email, which he did and of course in it it was stated that after review of the video they didn't see anything. He also said he would call(never did). On the 16th I said that I would need to see the video because how do I know they are telling the truth without me seeing it? He asked what would be a good day and I told him.  He the asked if I was available for a call that day, I said yes. Guess what? No call. A few days later was told I can't see the video blah blah blah FIGURES. Then the owner said \"I don't mind helping a bit in good faith\".  Good faith lol. I don't even care at the point after countless promised phone calls, really no updates, and them just saying they didn't do anything but I can't see the video so how do I know?? I don't need someone \"helping me a bit in good faith\". I've just learned my lesson about valet."}
{"text":"Wow. Three weeks open and it's already at a 3 star. 

Well, this was my second time visiting-- first being for the YelpElite Evening on Media Night before it opened.

My experience this time was so-so.. it consisted of A LOT OF WAITING. 

Valet was set up at the convention center next door due to the MGM using it's lot for a large Miss USA tent. We had to take the shuttle there which was perfectly fine but situation was different on the way back. You can imagine the number of people waiting to leave at 11:30 PM on top of only 2 shuttles running (with one going to get gas for 20 minutes) paired with 100 degree night heat and valet retrieval that took forever. We could've walked faster to the valet.. and I could've parked at MGM self parking and gotten my own car faster.  

I do realize that we came (group of 6) on a Friday evening so it would be busy. We were ready to wait and had a plan to get food in the meantime. If you are planning on coming here, try and come on a weekday evening because prices steeply jump during peak times.. $75/hour on levels 1 and 2 while it's $90/hour on level 3. We initially wanted level 3 but were told that if after an hour passed and we didn't get a text then ask if we could be moved to 1 or 2 faster. Well I didn't get a text.. so I switched preference. I still didn't get a text but did get a phone call (because apparently I didn't receive the text) asking if I still wanted the Bay.. YES I wanted the bay!

In the meantime, we went to the bar seating area with leather couches next to the stage and ordered some drinks. We wanted food but apparently no servers go through that area and the bartender couldn't serve us food. This was weird because I saw everyone else eating around us and there were menus on the tables. After a round of drinks from the nice bartender who came around to our table and an hour, a server finally approached.. but right after we ordered we got aforementioned phone call.

Long story short-- the food is super good here. The best parts are the Rock Shrimp and mini sliders.. GET THE DONUTS for dessert! It was so fun to inject.. also it was appropriate for National Donut Day. One order is enough for 6 people to be satisfied. Also recommend getting all three flavors for variety.

Also, for your first time signing into their system to play you have to register each person which takes like a billion minutes per person (and won't properly accept your phone number) ANNNND you have to pay an obligated lifetime membership of $5. If you don't really give a crap about the games and aren't too serious about scores (you can see where your ball goes after you hit on TV and via color code).. then I say register 2-3 people and just rotate turns. It also seemed like my hour started counting down even though I was still entering names and had not started playing yet.

All in all, for several plates of food, an hour and a half of game play, and rounds of drinks it came out to about $50/person. It's not cheap but it's a good time if you've never gone to Top Golf or if you are an avid golfer. Definitely not your run of the mill driving range.

I'm still trying to figure out how the pools fit into all of these things... I still have yet to see someone use it."}
{"text":"\"Please sir, can I have some more?\" Food portions make me feel like an orphan. Great entertainment though. Whether you're trying way too hard & practicing for the next PGA tournament or you're not very good & enjoying more beer than you should like myself or play even as bad as the more recent tiger woods, you'll have a grand ol' time. I'll cherish my players card as I travel to Colorado & Texas to continuously suck at the game of golf."}
{"text":"This place was so fun for my kids!!! I will totally go back in my next visit. The food was just ok but the atmosphere blew me away. They even had an Xbox connect downstairs that the kids could play with while we waited for our table."}
{"text":"I've only been here with my 8 year old niece, but I love it!


Staff service is fast and friendly and always hovering! The golf games are tons of fun here too! 
The menu is has pages and pages of yummy foods to choose from as well. PLUS it's in the shade and has A/C in the units which is a score!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for 30 minutes waiting to be served while about 10 employees stood around watching the World Cup. There's no excuses for this kind of service here."}
{"text":"Had the best fun. We need one at home. Really. Great couples night out. We laughed drank and ate. Perfect grown folk hangout. Though kids would enjoy too!"}
{"text":"What a great way to spend the afternoon. The prices vary by the time of day. Less expensive in the morning and more expensive during the evening and late night hours. We had two kids age 5 and 10 with NO golf experience. The four adults have little to no golf experience also. We had a blast. We had a few beers and some delicious chicken wings. Would definitely come back. What a great experience. We were told it would be a 90 minute wait, but we only waited 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Top Golf is perfect for everyone! A golfer, beginner, adult, or kid. The price is good and the price depends on the time and floor. Note only people 21 and over can go on the 3rd floor! The 1st and 2nd floor is for all ages. If you have kids I recommend the 2nd floor, but if you're an adult I recommend the 2nd or 3rd floor. Our waiter was really kind and food was really good. It's perfect for lunch. Our bay had everything we needed. Heat lamps and heated chairs so if we're cold we turned them on and even though it's not really private they made it feel like it's private. There's also tv screens showing the scores you got a tv that can play whatever you want if the Top Golf app! Each bay lets 6 people play but friends that aren't playing can come to the bay and watch. This is also a perfect place for events. There was also different modes for games. I recommend the Top Golf game, it's there signature game. There's even bars, a sports book, a shop, and a pool! While I waited I played shuffleboard with a friend. Plus there's a tram to MGM Grand to Top Golf and back. The parking can also get crowded because it's additional parking to the MGM Grand convention center and Wet Republic."}
{"text":"Topgolf. Is. Spectacular.

I went to a soft opening last Friday and the venue completely exceeded my expectations. Las Vegas has nothing like this and it's going to be such an amazing addition on the strip.

Topgolf is spacious - 4 floors with everything imaginable! There's 5 different bars, 2 pools, live music, delicious food, and of course - golfing. A very unique type of golfing:

- You reserve a hitting bay which has a booth with plenty of seating (can lounge and order food/drinks here if you're not much of a golfer)
- Those who want to play hit golf balls on the hitting bay towards a large, open field with multiple targets
- You earn points depending on where your golf ball lands; various targets on the field, closer to the bullseye (flags) and the farther you hit in distance earns you more points
- A microchip is in every golf ball so the score is sent virtually to a screen located in your hitting bay

The top 2 floors are for 21+, however, the overall atmosphere of Topgolf is great for all ages. Kids, teens, and adults can all enjoy themselves at Topgolf! This would be an excellent choice for a family outing - and with the great bars, food, and live music, I definitely can see young adults enjoying a birthday or bachelor/bachelorette party here. Oh and of course, I know locals like myself will thoroughly enjoy Topgolf... Especially those who enjoy golfing and drinking! 

The service here is the cherry on top. All of the workers, servers, and bartenders were incredibly welcoming, friendly, and attentive during the soft opening. I can't wait for Topgolf to officially open. I was so impressed with everything about this place and have nothing but positive things to say. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We had a great time on Saturday for a friend's birthday. The views are amazing and we had so much fun. The atmosphere was great and I was surprised to see there was more than just golf. There's a pool, great food, great music, and even a magician. The magician showed us some incredible tricks while we waited for our table.  He somehow knew the card my friend was thinking of before she said it! He blew our minds. The drinks were really tasty and the server was very attentive to our table. The wings were delicious. I definitely can not wait to go back."}
{"text":"Had the BEST time at Topgolf yesterday!  The service, the facility, and the drinks are all top notch!  Even though I'm terrible at golf and lost miserably to my husband, I already want to go back!  Definitely recommend to anyone interested in having some athletic fun while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Service is SO AWFUL. First, we were told we could sit on the rooftop patio to be served while we waited TWO HOURS for our bay to be ready (apparently, this is a normal wait time. Beware, you will also stand in line to even sign up for a bay. That took us about 30 minutes). As we were sitting after ordering our drinks and food at the bar, four servers came to the patio and started shutting everything down and made us feel like we weren't supposed to be there. No one ever brought us napkins, plates, or even asked if we were ok. Later in the day when we got to play the game, a family who was playing next to our bay left before their game time that they paid for ended, so they asked us to finish their play time. While hitting balls, a server came over to that bay and shut the game off on us.  We told him the family that just left asked us to finish the time they paid for.  He rolled his eyes and shrugged his shoulders as he said, \"you aren't making me any money, so I don't care\" as he was shutting down the bay. A manager did come over to apologize and he added that time onto our bay, but at that point, we were already turned off from the place. The game itself is amazing, too bad their staff isn't up to par. (Get it?). Such a shame. Hope they can step their game up and do better."}
{"text":"It was a blast. A great way to spend some of your day. The staff could not have been nicer. This place is great for all ages & skill sets. The area is very relaxing with comfy couches for those not golfing or those waiting. I felt the food was reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"OMG I need this place in Tampa!!!

I was visiting Scottsdale and went there on a Friday night. This might be one of the coolest places I have ever been to! What a creative idea and I bet they make millions. 

This is definitely not your average driving range. It is two stories and is a bar. Each section is like a VIP area with couches, table and your own section to golf. 

I've never been to a place like this, only seen it on tv and I am highly impressed! 

First, the service was great and attentive. We received everything fast without any issues. I was drinking and not eating but my group ordered various things from burger to salad and everyone was satisfied. 

The range overlooks a beautiful view of the Talking Stick casino. The computer calculates how well you do so you can play for fun or actually compete. You have to pay to play. I believe $30 or more. I wasn't playing much but I hit a few times and not bad for a newby.

Overall this is a great fun spot that also has music and it's a great place to hang out with your friends! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars but we tried to go on opening night after calling and hearing there was no wait. Once we got there, the line for membership (which you need to play) was out the door, down the stairs and into the parking lot. That was incredibly annoying. Not only would we have to wait for membership but once we had membership we would have had to wait for an open bay, not a no wait situation.
We went back around lunch time during the week and it was great. We had a great time and will definitely be back now that we don't have to wait for membership. The food was very good and it was fun to golf in a casual setting."}
{"text":"What an amazing place this is. Everyone was super friendly, drinks were reasonably priced, they have games besides golf you can play. They had 2 pool tables and video games along with a lounge. The bar itself was big with lots of tv's. The place was busy but not crowded which was cool. The bartenders were friendly and were on top of making sure you had a drink. You can play different types of golf games and the rate depends on when you go (FYI - the rate almost doubles the later you go so try and get there in the morning)"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service by the manager. We will not be back. Disorganized and food was over priced. Alcohol was over priced"}
{"text":"Original post: So much fun here! We spent two hours as a family just seeing who could make the most points by hitting into the targets. There are plenty of games to choose from and the instructions are given to you so you know how to play them. We are not the best golfers but we had fun just trying to see what we could do and laughing when we didn't do so well! 

Updated post: Just came back to celebrate with family after my graduation and it was pretty dead. It was about 4:30/5 on a Monday evening and we were put on the bottom floor that was completely empty except for three other families and a group of employees that were golfing in the middle bay. We were put off to the side and directly in front of a very windy doorway. Even though there were TONS of open bays. Our ball dispenser quit working within 10 min of us starting to play. They tried to fix the dispenser for a while and then moved us to the bay next to us. They were very kind about moving us and compensated the time it took to get it all figured out."}
{"text":"The concept is a lot of fun. The wait for a stall was pretty ridiculous I was told 30-45 minutes and waited about an hour and 15 minutes. The servers were great, but there was a ridiculous amount of confusion when I explained that I had not paid for the soda my daughter got while we were waiting. Evidently adding it to the food tab was somewhat challenging??? The food options were mediocre and a little pricey. In fact the entire concept is pretty over priced. We paid 75.00 for an hour plus food came to about 150.00 total. This is more like bowling than golfing so if you are a serious golfer bring your own clubs and a glove. Overall it was fun to do, but I probably will not do it again."}
{"text":"Great time with family in town. Great food,excellent service and an awesome staff. Took care of us from beginning  to end.. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Everything was overpriced and mediocre tasting. Make sure you make reservations, otherwise end up waiting hours to get a bay. You are better off going to play mini golf, or going to an actual golf course. Service was below average from the staff. Our server at our bay semi yelled at us to give him all our cards, then must have seen the look on my face and changed his tone."}
{"text":"I love the idea behind Top Golf. This location is even more over the top than most because well ... Vegas. The view is gorgeous at night when all the lights on the strip are sparkling. 

Three stars because we had a long wait to get a bay and the prices are pretty steep unless you have a ton of people. Would I go again? Probably, but only when friends are visiting  :)"}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is very good. The venue and general concept is great. I have to take two stars off fir the service. Service was AWFUL. The bartenders don't even look up. They can't do more than one task at a time & still manage to forget the fruit garnish. This place could be a gold mine. The owners & mgrs need to look up & watch Rehab; Party @ the Hard Rock. It was a reality show a few years back. They knew how to run a place this size. Hope they get it together."}
{"text":"We did Topgolf our first night in Las Vegas. We had a 4 hour wait on a Saturday night for the 1st or 2nd level, but totally worth it! Great atmosphere! Everyone enjoyed their experience here!"}
{"text":"Tried this place after my sister told me about it. It was a pretty great place. A bit pricey depending on when you go and if you go with alone or just with another, but with enough people it's quite cheap and very reasonable. The only reason it's three stars is that the golf clubs that they provide have very wore out handles. We are not asking for a high line golf club or have the handles be replaces if there is a nix, but they were really wore and made it uncomfortavle to grip. Also, not all of the bays are a great location. The best is tight in the middle, we were placed on the edge and was easy to have the ball get caught in the net if it hooked without any chance to fall into one of the holes at all. We were also there for about an hour, so we didn't get any food or drinks so not sure if it was good or worth the price. Will need to revisit the place again in the future, hope they will have some in the LA area in the near future. I would still recommend this place for people to visit. I also need to visit this place at night because their range glows at night, or so I've been told."}
{"text":"This was my second time to Topgolf.  I'm a guy that really couldn't care less about golf, but Topgolf actually makes golf fun.  The food is very good and service has been great each time.  Get there early because they get busy fast."}
{"text":"On a sunny hot day like it was on Saturday  it was refreshing to have two wonderful Top Golf associates take care of us. Michelle and Desiree were extremely hospitable and attentive. They had great patience with a big group of sweaty drunk fellas. It's not easy and they did it with smiles. We will definitely request them next time we come back."}
{"text":"As an experience this is 5 stars, but I have a hard time giving 5 stars (so that's on me).

First tip is go ahead and get your $5.00 membership online before you go so you don't have to stand in the line to even do that.  There are other membership levels available as well.  Once you have your QR code you can go directly to the concierge and they will print your card.  Once you have your card you can take that to the desk and they will put you on the list for the next available bay.  You can pay a fee to jump the line, but if it's super busy it may not be worth it.  

Another tip is to make sure everyone has their own membership and card ready to go.  If you're trying to play off of one card you can, but it makes it difficult to keep up with scores if there are more than two or three people.  It is a game system so it isn't a typical driving range although I guess you could make it that if you wanted.  All the balls are gps chipped so that it will tell you if you scored points, distance etc...  It's really just a fun party atmosphere though.  If you're looking for a nice peaceful driving range experience this isn't for you.  Also if you have children that will be offended or emotionally disturbed by loud vulgar language and loud boorish behaviors by people drinking and partying then be advised you might be sitting next to that.  I'm sure staff wouldn't let it get too out of hand, but there you go;  it's several bars with a driving range. 

There are three levels and I'm not sure if it's every night, but the 3rd level area turns into a dance party at some point in the evenings and the range/games are lit up and adjust in time to the music.  Way cool.

Once they text you that your bay will be available they will escort you to it and get you set up with your server and show you how to set up for game play and how to extend time etc...  The hosts and servers are all very good and nice and accommodating.  They have full bar service and standard bar food.  It is expensive and you will spend more than you think you will so it may say $$$31-60 but you will pay $$$$ over $61 almost guaranteed.

Another tip is that there are price differences depending on when you go.  Sometimes you get there early for the lower price, but you don't get in before the rates go up, so be aware of that.

Every bay is equipped with lounge seating, tv display for the range and another tv that seems to be set to the same channel, but you might have the option to change it to another channel for your viewing pleasure...not sure, but probably.  It is loud, it is hot but it's a fun change of pace and I'm glad it's here!"}
{"text":"Wowww Coool Golf Funnn. I just wanted to say the atmosphere is wonderful after a hards days work or any time. I was welcomed by Tim at the welcome desk and he made sure it was painless and fast to be on your way to funnn Golffff. Thanks TopGolf. Another Stand out was my Beautiful server ~Brandy~. So, cool that she can easily explain how to maximize your time there using the computerized interface. Major Props Brandy from John."}
{"text":"Just left after spending an hour and a half online, in 90 degree weather, in the sun.., for our fathers day plans....well at that point a girl told us theres a 3 and a half hr wait to get a suite to golf....and u need a membership card..which i knew about the card and read up online about but I didnt know the spider web of lines that we were gonna have to endure for our fathers day visit...btw my party have been looking forward to comng to top golf ...theres was 3 or 4 different lines that u need to go thru for the \"card\". I was willing to wait for my family. But they didnt want too. We are very disappointed in the maze of lines that we had would if gone thru but to achieve wat other companys do so gracefully.  Top golf thumbs down.   Well go spend our money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"We had a blast during the Super Bowl!  I wasn't sure about going to a golf place to watch the Super Bowl but it couldn't have been any better!  I did hit a few balls too. The foot was amazing. I'd definitely want to go back again when it's not so busy."}
{"text":"So much fun and a great location with an awesome view of the talking stick resort and their lights at night.

Night price is $45 for an hour. You get your own personal bay. 1 hour was just enough time for my daughter and I to play a few games and eat dinner."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It has so much to offer for any party or just to go hang out. We came on a Wednesday afternoon in July, the super friendly hostesses welcomed us and we had a 20min wait for second level. We ordered drinks and that's the reason for 1 star  less: drinks are a rip off!!  
We explored the place and it's just a waw! The activities like bag throwing, ping pong and the 2 awesome pools from which you can watch the big screen next to it. Impressive. 
We got a golf boot center. The hostess was very nice, young but just great at her job there. She explained the computer and set us up. 
But we had to wait on a waitress to appear. Her service was terrible. Another star off . It was hot out and to get a drink at our boot was a mission. 
The game was so much fun but we left after an hour with a receipt of $47 for the game and about the same for few drinks and a fancy water.
I would totally go back but bring a bag with waters before I get dehydrated there.
Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"I love Top Golf and wrote a lengthy review for the Scottsdale location. Just the same idea over in Gilbert. We ended up meeting family here and had the MacDaddy burger which is the man n cheese burger. Wow it's really good and was reasonably priced. Yes TopGolf can be expensive during the peak hours but if you share with your friends then it's not too bad. Plus it's a blast if you bring your own irons to practice. Not much more to say so if you are looking for a fun time with your friends/family then add this to your list. As I mentioned in my Scottsdale review you don't even have to be into golf to enjoy TopGolf. Just bagged with your friends and whack the little white ball down the range!"}
{"text":"Well I've heard all the buzz about Topgolf for a while..finally had to see it for myself. Well I was impressed! Topgolf is like a high end bowling alley but for golf. Best way to describe it. 

You can rent a lane for up to 6 players for 30-60 mins. Everything is based on a card that cost $5 to register. I'm not thrilled about paying $5 for a card and that's why I left out a star. That fee as well as the overall cost is quite high in my opinion but if you split it with your friends then it's really not too bad. 

The overall layout of the facility is really cool. There are 3 levels of golf lanes. I really liked this location as the backdrop of the mountains and TSR is really amazing. Plus come during sunset and hopefully you can get a lane towards the end and watch an amazing AZ sunset from behind. 

Topgolf provides basic clubs here, but for a better challenge and better practice if you are really into golf is to bring your own. Just make sure you don't bring any drivers, woods, or even hybrids. They explained that in the past people were hitting over the net. I didn't think it was possible but if you were in the top level and were a good golfer you probably could hit it over. 

What makes Topgolf so fun are the mini games you and your friends can play. There is top score, or try for top shot which makes you try to hit the specific greens. The balls are tracked to your players card so you can get an accurate reading of your shots. 

They also provide service to the lanes, and your own TV which you can change the channel. Full bar, a few craft beers, and full menu. I didn't try any of the food but it looked like typical bar food. 

All in all I really enjoyed Toogolf. If you are a military vet or police/fire be sure to ask for the lifetime hero discount. 10% off. Also works if anyone in your party has it which is cool. I've already been to this location a few times as well as the Gilbert location. 

I think Topgolf is super fun. It's also fun for the non golfer in your group as well as women. My wife doesn't golf, but loved coming here to swing some clubs. You don't need to be into golf to enjoy Topgolf. Go try it for yourself and see."}

Aye bartenders keep doing your job right yall killing it"}
{"text":"Cool spot with good beer... however some of the staff is among the most unprofessional I've ever seen. My group was there till close and we were about to leave when a security guard told us to leave in which we respond, \"no problem.\" One minute passes and the same security guard comes back and tells us we need to leave immediately while we are on our way out. Meanwhile there are plenty of other guests still hanging out longer than we were. As we are walking out the door I happened to mention the rudeness in the security guards tone... not that it should matter, but he heard what I said. Next thing I know this security guard and a manager followed us out of the building while coming at me with the utmost inappropriate remarks and tried taking a picture of my license plate which I thought was shady. I work in the service industry and if I treated my guests like these two employees did to us let's just say I wouldn't have a job. Will not be returning until management can better assess their interests in their employees."}

And so was I...with my mango Margharita :) the menu has plenty of food options as well as drinks. A little pricey, but well worth it! Wish they had something like this close to home!"}
{"text":"I would actually give 3.5 stars to Topgolf. Here's the deal I like Topgolf. I have been to other locations in other states. Today I went with my father in law, sister in law and husband. It was a beautiful day. There was a 30-45 minute wait which wasn't bad at all and we were able to pass the time by quickly playing some pool downstairs. I don't know if we really even waited 30 minutes for our bay. We got a bay on the 2nd level. 2nd/ 3rd level is key! We ordered a bucket of corona lites and I ordered a margarita. We also ordered chips and guac. I will post a picture of the guac and salsa dishes. The appetizer is called chips and guac but underneath it also says you get salsa with it. When they brought it out, it was the tiniest guac dish I've seen and the salsa dish was much larger. My margarita was awful it was probably 98% margarita mix that was super sweet. Also it didn't have salt on the rim (on the menu it shows with salt on the rim). We were disappointed with the appetizer and I was disappointed in the margarita too. We ordered a gluten friendly buffalo chicken flatbread which was really good so the redeemed them. As always the golf portion is great and fun. Couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day."}
{"text":"I've been to Top Golf in Vegas a few times now that it has opened.  Every experience has been pretty awesome and yet so different at the same time.  

I have been to hit some balls and try their food and drinks and that was awesome. The cost can add up pretty quickly, but it still seems to be a great value for the overall experience. The staff from start to finish was amazing and very helpful.

Next, I went to see a concert.  Soul Asylum!!  Yes, this venue also hosts live concerts.  The concert section was nice and small so we were able to easily see and hear the band from a few feet away.  It was amazing.

Then this last weekend we went to a Motley Brew craft beer event that was hosted on the 4th floor of Top Golf.  (On a separate note, Motley Brew events are pretty amazing themselves!) We were able to check out the entire 4th floor and hit a few balls while sampling various craft beers at the many pouring stations throughout.  All the servers/hosts were top notch and friendly, especially Kaylee who was super awesome and was pouring a great IPA brew.

So even if you just want a fresh and cool place to go hang out in Vegas, Top Golf is a great choice.  Even without doing the golf part, just watching sports on the big screens and having a beverage or three.

If their is a negative, I would say it is the parking situation.  It can get pretty backed up since it is Valet only, not just before, but the line to pick up your car can take a little while.  But the Valet crew is very friendly too and they are hustling, so it is what it is."}
{"text":"Great time! Love the chicken and waffles! The fish bowl drinks get you absolutely tanked ! I have never been able to drive out of here always have to drink a fish bowl ! The clubs are nice. I love there balls.  There balls are Stuffed with a GPS. You know exactly where the balls go"}
{"text":"The concept of this place is a solid 5 stars... The cool bar atmosphere, the good food and drinks, all topped off with an idea that makes golf \"fun\" until two in the morning. 

The cost seems reasonable for all of the above, about $80/$90 an hour on average for 6 people. Parking is free.

The execution of it - that is where they struggle. Came on Sunday night and played for about 2.5 hours. Did a few different games,  which were really fun. Over the course of the night drinks took about 30+ minutes and food over an hour. It wouldn't have been so bad if we were warned about that, or kept up to date. I kept wishing I had snuck food/drinks in because I was starving. In the end the margarita were amazing and worth the wait, but just barley.

I'd be back, but only for the golf & margaritas... Skip the food."}
{"text":"We came on a Wednesday night around 8pm thinking it was going to be slower, but the place was crazy packed. So we were told the wait would be 2 hours wjich it turned out to be 1 1/2 hrs. During that time we ate somewhere else, so unfortunately we never tried any food. 

When we arrived back, we were escorted to our section where we then ordered drinks snd started hitting some balls. The atmosphere was so live and everyone enjoyed themselves."}
{"text":"Michelle from Boston AND Drew were our favorite!!! We left our phone at top golf and went to the casino and they brought it back to us plus they were super nice and accommodating! We will def be coming back just because of them!! We love them, we work in old town in the industry and they're customer service was beyond 5 star but that's the highest we can rate so 5 star plus plus plus!!!"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying they have only been open a week so the delay in time was expected. We waited in line for about 45 minutes and got checked in. The wait took about 2.5 hours. Once the \"hype\" dies down I'm sure it won't be like that all the time. 

There is a small seating area downstairs where you can eat with maybe 15-20 tables. They have pool tables too. However my table only ordered some fries, a burger, and wings and it took nearly an hour and a half just to get it. Again, they're new they just open but as someone who's worked as a server when you tell me your food runners/servers don't know the table numbers or where to take it that's disconcerting and not that hard to learn. Everything we ordered had issues my friend and daughter were missing items and I got something different than what I ordered. Overall, the eating experience was okay. 

When we finally got our bay we had an absolute blast. We will definitely be back for that and probably recommending reserving a spot before hand but since we were able to sit down and eat the wait didn't seem as long as it was."}
{"text":"Super sweet multi level driving range with a Vegas twist. If you have a family, with a group or solo. You will feel comfortable and welcomed. Lots of free parking. Super easy process. At the entrance there's a huge movie theatre style board with the prices listed. You rent a Bay and it's sectioned off with VIP club style cushion seating so it feels semi private. It comes complete with a set of golf clubs clearly marked for drivers, irons and wedges.  As you swing and wack your golf ball trying to make it into one of marked holes you can watch a game. At the far end is a huge screen. You can order food and the novelty drink holder is a golf bag with the golf club as your straw. Awesomeness! At the entrance there is a gift shop to the right. Then a huge area to sit in and watch more gigantic TV screens. There's shuffle board and a bunch of corn hole sets. A bar is located farther in the building but there are several bars. Even a section for live music, you can take lessons. Women you can take lessons in a relaxed environment specifically catered to women. Luv this. You can even get professionally fitted for clubs here. 

This is a great alternative to have Vegas fun if your aren't into the club scene. Awesome place to be day or evening. The crowd here is friendly and everyone is just enjoying themselves. Very casual. It's multi level so you can go to floors above the main floor. Ellen Degeneres even came to hit a few and had a great time at TopGolf. Out of all the driving ranges I've been to. This definitely is my Top Golf choice and another favorite thing to do in Vegas. Feeding my competitive side.

{"text":"It began as a disappointing experience but Andrew H. (the Marketing Team Lead) totally fixed the situation and went above and beyond to ensure we had a great time.

We showed up in the early evening on a Friday night and were told it would be a two hour wait. We were cool with that and had dinner at the sports bar inside. It ended up that the two hour way was totally off. We waiting another hour and were told it'd be at least another 30 minutes. By this time, we were ready to leave... and we did. However, Andrew saw us on the way out and asked if we enjoyed our experience. We told how how disappointed we were with our first ever Top Golf visit.

He apologized and invited us back the next night. We arrived and they were READY FOR US. A host took us to our spot, introduced us to our waitress, set up our game, and we were loving it all in no time. It was a fantastic experience. Any level of golfer (even someone who's never touched a club before) will love Top Golf. It's a genius concept and, with customer service like Andrew's, we can't wait to go back.

If only Los Angeles had a Top Golf!"}
{"text":"Had a blast at Top Golf last week.  Although a little pricey for the hour it is a great  place for some friendly competition!  

We were able to get in right  away on a busy Sunday  afternoon.  We had some issues with our monitor but were  able to get it reset to a little more than an hour which is great because they charge by the hour.  My only concern and my reason for the four stars is that no one knew how to fix  it or where to fix it.  It took the server several trips  to finally get the issue resolved.  

All in all Top Golf  was awesome.  Definitely going here  again hopefully with a group of friends  I can show off my skills to."}
{"text":"***Although topgolf is cool, this review is just for their food...***

Ordered a few items while we were golfing. Went with the house marinated steak sticks, pretzel board, backyard wings, buffalo wings. The meat on the pretzel board was amazing, can I get just an order of that?? Fruits were also pretty good. The steak sticks and wings were scrumptious too. I really loved their buffalo wings but a lot of people enjoyed the backyard wings more. Both great though.

Service was good for the most part."}
{"text":"Was overall disappointed with my first visit to the Scottsdale Top Golf location after having very positive experiences at the Gilbert location. We went with a group of 6 people and had a 10% off coupon. We presented the coupon to the front desk but decided not to request our bay until our entire group arrived to not start the time clock. We decided to share one bay rather than two bays because we were told the only two bays were on the first floor. The place was slammed on the Friday afternoon around lunch time. By the time our group arrived we went back to the front desk and were told that we would have to go to guest services to apply the coupon and pay, this would have been helpful to know the first time we went up because the line for guest services was over 30 people deep. We finally paid and waited another 10 minutes to be shown to the bay and were super frustrated to be shown to the first floor after already indicating we didn't want to be there. The staff member had misquoted the hourly rate for the bay and ran the wrong persons credit card for the difference so our first ten minutes in the bay was working to correct his error with no attempt to waive the misquoted rate. We got set up and our waitress arrived, service was decent, nothing special. I ordered a burger with bacon and fried egg, the bacon was super fatty and not crisp, I ended up pulling it off. I ordered a ranch with my meal but she forgot it so by the time she brought it out my tater tots were cold. From start to finish this was just a pretty bad experience, such a disappointment since I have really enjoyed going to Top Golf in the past. I had thought about going to Top Golf for my birthday next month with a group of friends but now I think I will have to find somewhere else to go."}
{"text":"10 stars for Top Golf! Great golf experience for newbie like myself! The food is amazing as well Make sure to order the Steak Pitas and the donuts! So yummy!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and it has been so much fun. It's always pretty busy but they have plenty for you to do while you are waiting. The food is delicious so if you are going to wait awhile defiantly eat. It is pricey I wish they charged per game instead of time limits, especially if you are going with guys who like to take practice swings."}
{"text":"Very fun and a great place to check out when you want to break up the routine of gambling and drinking. You get to be outdoors and do a little day drinking and playing. Not to mention it's a great view and the parking is free. Perfect activity for groups that want to drink and hang out."}
{"text":"The food is great. Service was good and the atmosphere is a great time with friends. You can tell they've put a lot of effort to ensure this place runs smoothly."}
{"text":"What an awesome place! We had a meeting here during CES and everyone loved it.  Too bad we couldn't experience the night lights, but that still doesn't take away the fun factor. 

The pricing is setup per hour, per bay (picture a bowling alley with nice seating).  Depending on what level you choose, and what day of the week, pricing varies.  Each bay can fit up to 6 people.  Since we came in the morning, we had brunch here as well.  Let me tell you, the food here is unbelievable, so good. 

We ordered the following:
7 Layer Dip
Kalbi Short Rib Tacos - comes with 3
Tater Tots
Breakfast Sandwiches
Margherita Pizza

Out of all of them, I would say the tacos and the sandwich were the best choices.  I've heard their dinner menu is just as good too. 

The clubs here are provided, both Men's and Women's.  If you are super competitive, you may also BYOC (bring your own clubs)."}
{"text":"So much fun... like a Dave n Busters for golf. You buy a card for $5 and go to your station to golf! It's fun at night because you can go to the bar and drink. The Orange Creamsicle drink is bomb and so are the buffalo chicken sliders! It's $45 a group per hour but cheaper during the day!"}
{"text":"Finally got to go back 
Had so much fun it wasn't busy but it was 1pm on a Thursday in March and cold outside- But not at Topgolf! The heated sofa is enough for me to go back on its own- I normally freeze and even while playing the heaters kept me warm - playing was super fun and easy and the food we got was all yummy - tried most all of the appetizers and sliders. Plus our server was right on top of it. Can't wait to go back again and again and again- 
Keep up the great fun Topgolf! See you soon"}
{"text":"Fun time but be ready for a long wait if it's busy.  The food is good but don't expect great service.  The golf was awesome and the food was better than I expected.  Great place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Fun place to kick back with family and/ or friends and have fun.  Experience in golf isn't a must.  Out of town guests seem to really enjoy this as a new experience"}
{"text":"FORE!!! Topgolf is an awesome adult playground!

They have different prices for different day/time periods. They take reservations, I am sure it gets packed on weekends. I came on a weekday and it was pretty empty and no wait.

They have a large private parking lot. They are connected to MGM, about a 10 minute walk from the casino. 

Service was nice and friendly. I liked how they warn you not to Happy Gilmore the balls into the field. 

Drinks are not to expensive. Food is typical bar grub. They have shuffleboard for non golfers on the second level.

If you are left handed, like me, you have to ask for separate clubs.

If you never played there before you have to pay $5 for the membership card. Pretty stupid in my opinion. 

Basically an entertaining version of the driving range with multiple levels. I played on the second level and thought it was a pretty cool view. You can see some of the strip. There are target holes in the hitting area for the games so you can collect points. It was fun for the first 5 minutes, then not so much. I am not a golfer so I was not to entertained. Awesome concept, just is not for me.

Avoid driving your cars in this area. If the balls sail over the net, they land on the street right in front."}
{"text":"Overall our experience with Topgolf was okay. We left with the distinct feeling they were overstaffed because there were employees everywhere but our interactions with the employees were ineffective. 

When we arrived there were three employees at the door greeting people. We walked in to two lines and a bar. We weren't sure if the people we were meeting had a bay reserved or not and we weren't aware that we need our own players cards to play. We awkwardly stood around for several minutes and not one of the staff members said anything to us. When our friends arrived they told us we had to get our own membership and we got to queue up in line to get a card. Then after getting the card we got to queue up again to get a bay. You have to provide your ID, email and phone number to purchase your $5 membership which seemed excessive to me to hit a couple golf balls.

While getting us set up at a bay the staff member told us we could split the cost. Great! Except then he said he would have to over charge the card since he couldn't split the cost to exactly half. I looked at the screen and pointed out the charge for half the $35 rental fee ($17.50). I wonder how often people are overcharged because of this.

After the initial set up we were finally able to play! I actually enjoying the driving range, not being a golf person I like that the machine kept score for me and the targets were fairly large. Our waitress only brought one set of silverware for our dinner and several napkins. Perhaps this was on purpose since only my salad needed a fork? However I have never been to a restaurant that only gave one person silverware. 

Our group of 4 got in two solid round of golfing and dinner and drinks in the one hour we were there. While discussing our experience on the way home I found out they charged my boyfriend $16 for my $12 margarita which was annoying but not worth turning around and going back to fix. I will say the margarita was small even for $12 and my salad wasn't very big considering it was supposed to be an entrée. 

Would I go back? Yes if someone invited me but I am in no rush to return. If I do go back it would probably be for beers and golf not for a full meal."}
{"text":"This is the lettuce that was put on my buffalo chicken sliders. I have no words for how disgusted I am. Great fun using the bays for hitting balls, but the food is awful and the service is sub par."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that makes a mundane Monday seem like a weekend.The concept is amazing and i love the bay areas.It's a great place to hang with your friends or even co-workers.Don't forget to get your membership its pretty simple.
This place gets really crowded so getting a bay can be a challenge,Food options are vast special mention to the appetizers.The one thing that gets to me is the service one literally has to Stalk the server to get refills and food to the table.

TopGolf is not just all about golf(but it kinda is).If you are not the i-like-to-swing-a-club type they also have other gaming options, or you could just sit,relax and watch the others having a gala time.
If you are in Scottsdale or plan to come here ever do check this place out.You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"In town for the annual family vacation and we decided to check out Top Golf. One word: fun! Everyone had a blast and enjoyed seeing how far they could hit the ball and how many points they could get. We will for sure be back next year."}
{"text":"Loved it!! Good food & well made drinks!! No need to golf in order to have a good time here!! 
Topgolf Las Vegas located behind MGM Grand casino is a 4 level indoor/outdoor establishment with an energetic vibe and ambiance that has a little something for everyone...golf, swim, eat, drink, gamble, beer pong, corn hole, live music, sports book betting, golf shop, and plenty of huge tv screens and comfy couches to lounge in and watch sports. They also offer private suites & golf bays for parties, company events, meetings and a VIP section for celebrities. 

If you gamble, they accept M Life players card on all the video poker machines! 

Whether you come alone or with a group of friends...you will have a great time!!"}
{"text":"I've never been to a Top Golf before, so I don't have much to compare it to but...
This place was completely understaffed. Especially it being a holiday. My sister and I arrived with our parents today and waited in line to get Top Golf cards, which you need to have. Understandable. Then we went to the dining area to get food drinks since it was an hour wait for the bay. No one came over to us for at least ten minutes, so my sister and I ordered drinks at the bar. While we waited for our drinks to be made we asked if we had a server because my family was very hungry and thirsty. We were told that we should have one but that they were swamped so the bartender said she would  come over to take our food order. We sat down and a few minutes later the waitress came over and took food orders. We forgot to ask for water for our parents, but usually that is just brought to the table. Since it wasn't, we went to the bar again and waited for waters. We continued to wait for our food and were finally offered comped chips and salsa for waiting, since the server said they came out right away. Our bay was finally ready, so we headed up and told the server to transfer our food bill to our bay. We get to out bay and go over all the precautions and sign the waivers with our cards. Our food finally arrives with no utensils and no dressing on the salad...and there are no balls. Oh, and the chips and salsa never came either. Fine. They move us to the next bay and we had to ask the server upstairs for silverware.  We did not care about the salad dressing by then. Finally we think we are about ready to start, and guess what.....the balls aren't coming out. The technician comes over to fix the ball situation and we are able to start hitting balls and we had a great time.   We are ready to leave and ask for the check and it comes out with chips and guacamole on the bill but we never even ordered the chips and guacamole. Was that supposed to be our comped chips and salsa that they were now charging us for? Overall, the golf experience was good, but the food or service was not."}
{"text":"Been coming here for four years....from the valley so this (was) good place to come for food, drinks, and some fun. Unfortunately the past three times I've visited Topgolf the system they've switched to has not texted me when my bay is ready. Which as has been the ultimate issue coming here. And plus the \"lifetime\" membership they use to give you only cost a dollar has now switched to $5.  But has far as getting in and trying to golf has been such a terrible experience that I've decide I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Only giving three stars to this place for the food and golfing. Coming from out of state I had heard many positive things about topgolf, unfortunately our service did not meet these standards. Our server, Adam D. Introduced himself, took our food order and was not seen again. After playing our one hour golf season for over 45 minutes our food finally arrived and we were rushed to finish eating. Understandable it was a busy night not once did Adam apologize for the wait or explain why our appetizers took over 30 minutes to come out. The golfing experience was fun and the food tasted great when we finally got it. Work on customer service and this place would be awesome."}
{"text":"Great place and a lot of fun! Would of been 5 stars but the service was terrible. First off my valid Texas I.D. was denied by the manager who was a complete dick. Second off its mid summer and over 90 degrees outside and it took over 20 min to get a pitcher of water and then another 15 for them to bring out glasses to go with the pitcher. Our waitress was gone the whole time.. The worst part is that all the employees were sitting around chatting while we were waiting. COMPLETELY UNPROFESSIONAL AND HORRIBLE SERVICE!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here and now I am super bummed.  I ended up walking out before we got to play. The concept and layout is amazing but the vibe/service is so off. 
We first went to the bar on the first floor to get a drink. The bar was empty yet we were ignored by the bartender until we finally went to the upstairs bar. It was also not busy and took over 10 minutes to get our drinks. After we signed up to rent a bay we decided we would order food while we waited the over or under hour that was estimated. We sat at a couch with a menu and watched servers walk by but not one asked us if we wanted to order. The waitresses seemed just walked around in pods. We were sitting there with menus in our hands trying to get someone's attention. It was not busy at all and completely over staffed yet not one person interacted with us. 15 minutes and our pod is ready!!! We were stoked! When we went to check into our bay we were ignored until we finally decided to leave. The whole time I was there I felt like was begging to spend money."}
{"text":"I was out here last summer visiting friends and thought this place was an absolute blast. A bit spendy, but to be expected when you're in Vegas. This place has a great vibe, friendly staff, and of course, it's good entertainment for a group. I will be returning this spring and making a stop at Top Golf for sure."}
{"text":"Girls at guest services were extremely rude. Sarah (with brown hair) and her friend (didn't catch her name) with blonde hair in a messy ponytail decided it was more important to gossip and finish their conversation than it was to help people waiting in line. Once they finally finished their irrelevant conversation they decided they better pay us the decency of taking our money. RUDE girls. Shouldn't be in guest services or employed by Topgolf for that matter. Not impressed. Hire some people with class, not some disrespectful teenage girls."}
{"text":"After a rocky start, this turned out to be a fun night. When we walked in to a room full of staff members and guests doing the wobble in a flash mob, I almost turned around and left. I am just not into that clubby, party time atmosphere. Our friends had arrived ahead of us and put our name down for a bay and when they told us it would be an hour and a half wait I was thinking that it was going to be a long night. We were pretty hungry so all 6 of us got a table (after some targeted hovering... they do not have a hostess). We ordered the nachos and cheeseburger sliders. Both were tasty but the portion sizes were way too small for the price. The nachos did not come in the usual pile but rather there were about 8 chips individually placed on the plate and topped with cheese. The other toppings like guacamole and sour cream dollops on the plate but since we had no utensils it was pretty hard to get any of those. I really wish I had taken a picture of it since it was the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. The sliders were ok but kind of bland. We also ordered a few rounds of drinks which were very slow in coming. The waitress was trying her best to keep up but it was so crowded and loud it was a loosing battle. The music was way too loud for conversation but at least we all liked the songs... a mix of latin pop and 80s hip hop.

When we eventually got up stairs things started to turn around. We had a \"VIP\" bay so we got comfortable couches (like the outdoor patio kind) to lounge on. That gave us more room to spread out and order more food and drinks. We got the wing trio. They were all really good but the wings with the Asian sauce were the best. The guy showed us how to use the computer system and how to play the game. Basically it is like skee ball where you are trying to get the ball into certain holes and the ones furthest to the back are worth more points. The computer keeps track of whose turn it is and the score just like at the bowling alley. I didn't do too great since I am not a golfer but it was still a lot of fun. I did like the fact that you pay by the hour and so you can have as many players as you want in the game. The girls in the group formed one team and took turns playing since we weren't as into the competition as the men. This whole thing was organized in honor of my friends birthday and he is a big golf fan so he just loved it. The holes are lit up with colored lights so we could see them even though it was dark but I do wish they had more lights on the \"course\" or else some way of tracking overall distance because sometimes someone would hit a ball really far and we lost sight of it and then they didn't get any points since it didn't go in one of the holes.

We ended up staying 2 hours so that was $90. And the food and drinks came out to probably around $150 plus tax and tip. So, its a pretty expensive night but definitely a different experience then just the regular sports bar. I would recommend it for a special occasion with a group. But I do wish they took reservations because the wait is ridiculous."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday night, and I have no idea how to golf but it was really fun! We all had a really good time, the food looked good we had only chips and dip but other then that we didn't get to try anything else on the menu. The prices are decent, we would have spent the same amount or probably more going to a club but this was more personal and something different! Highly recommend coming here if you are just looking for a good time with friends and a place to drink and hang out!"}
{"text":"I am so pissed off!  I came to the Vegas Golden Knights televised game viewing tonight.  The parking lot was full.  I asked a valet attendant where to park and he ignored me.  I saw a sign at Top Golf that said additional parking at the MGM GRAND.  I went and parked in the MGM garage thinking the parking would be validated due to the full parking lot.  I walked back to Top Golf and the door receptionist told me they do not validate parking!  WHY THE HELL DO THEY HAVE A SIGN THAT SAYS ADDITIONAL PARKING AT MGM?!!!!.  THE SIGN SHOULD SAY ADDITIONAL PAID PARKING!!!!   Then I go to the bar to get a drink.  Bartenders walk by just looking at me while I stand at the bar!  I ACTUALLY HAVE TO FRANTICALLY WAIVE MY HANDS AND ARMS IN MY DIRECTION TO GET THEM TO COME OVER TO ME!!!   I will never come back for and event here."}
{"text":"Why are they paying around 100 people a night to stand around and give dirty looks to the tables they're not helping. 

Decent food and fun atmosphere otherwise."}
{"text":"We spent a few hours here for a friends birthday (Christmas time) and the experience and atmosphere was great and lots of fun! There was a wait but that was expected for a holiday weekend. They allow you to wait at the upper or lower bar, order food, order drinks, and mingle with other guest. The ladies room is very clean. The staff was very nice considering who busy it was and how flustered some of them were. The only thing I didn't like was that you HAD to have your membership card with you or pay another $5 to receive a new card. Obviously it's another way to make money but it's frustrating. There should be a system that customers should be able to attend without physically having a card. Prices are great. Food was even better. Well worth the trip and will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"Kimberly and Leslie were so wonderful! My bracelet flew off whilst golfing and they were very helpful in retrieving it! 5 stars for the management team."}
{"text":"2nd one I've been to. Love the concept, and the staff is clearly well motivated. Always friendly and helpful. Clean and new looking facility. Food was good, only comment would be to be more clear about a (ridiculous) $5 up charge for woodford vs bulleit. That ticked me off but otherwise, great experience"}
{"text":"Well the idea is great for starters. It was our first time there and we had nothing but problems. First off you pay by the hour $75. The computer kept freezing so they gave us 30min of free game. We ordered some beer and food. The waitress came back with a $380 tab..it was wrong so it was changed to $330 because of their mistake. Then they charged is $550. Oh wait their bad again. So they went ahead and charged us $75 less. We went back to get our car out of valet. Well because top golf kept us at least an hr longer than needed the valet was shut down and we had to walk to the main MGM valet which is not close at all. The management was less than helpful and the experience was awful. We talked to employees that work their and a majority of them said they were putting in their 2 weeks because of how poorly it is ran. Will not go back."}
{"text":"You don't have to be a golf fan to have a great time here. This place was a ton of fun and a great change of pace in las vegas. Its a cool concept that makes the driving range/golf fun, its like playing a fully interactive video game. You can do the typical hit golf balls as far as you can, but they have several other challenges/games to play based on accuracy to range. The equipment here is super up to date and modern and the golf clubs they provide are more then adequate (you can bring your own if you want). The range/game system is easy to use and the staff do a great job explaining it. The staff here were all very good, well informed and attentive to the guests. service gets 5 stars in my book. Each bay/tee comes with table service to get drinks and food which I would recommend. You can have up to 6 people to share the space so its great hang out spot when you get tired of the clubs/bars/casinos and want some fresh air There are plenty of televisions to stay update on the sports going on and they have a lounging pools and music stage with live music from time to time. This place really changed my mind on golf/driving range and I would gladly go back as it was a ton of fun. One of the highlights my visit to las vegas"}
{"text":"This place is great and you don't have to be a golf pro to have fun. Ask for a bay on the second or third floor if you're not an experienced golfer. You pay by the hour regardless of how many people in your party, and even though it's more expensive to go at night, it's a lot more fun because they light up the holes as soon as Talking Stick turns their lights on at sunset.
However, I really would not recommend getting any food here. Both times I've ordered food (chicken tenders and chicken sandwich) I've gotten food poisoning..."}
{"text":"Cool concept. Topgolf combines the ease of play that putt-putt golf provides with a game-like atmosphere similar to bowling in a driving range setting. There are 3 levels which can fill up fast on the weekends, so getting there early is recommended.

We came here for a friend's birthday party and enjoyed the beautiful weather. There are different games that you can play, all centering around hitting your golf ball in a certain colored zone. This means that even though you might be a seasoned golfer, you won't necessarily gain points if you don't hit the ball in the exact area where the zones are. You can bring your own clubs, or they have ones at the range that you can use, separated by number/type and by what distance they can hit.

Prices here are by the hour, and are tiered by time (Morning, afternoon, evening). The morning times are the cheapest by the hour, with prices increasing as you approach evening. We got here around 9 A.M. when they open, and there was already a line out the door. 

In addition to the driving range, there are overhead TVs so you can watch professional golf while playing golf, an indoor lounge area, and tables where you can snack, imbibe, or have a full meal. The menu itself consists of bar/party type food such as fries, sandwiches, and some wonderfully delightful donut holes that you fill with your choice of 3 different flavors.

Service here was excellent, provided by our server Ashley. 

Overall it's a fun place if you're looking for a group activity that provides casual sport, food, and entertainment. Just be sure you know how to swing that golf club without injuring yourself, since I twisted my wrist while swinging and it's still a little sore a few days later!"}
{"text":"I went there with my 2 almost 3 year old, they had clubs for him! Our server Devon was awesome, wasn't pushy, took care of us the entire time. Great place for family fun"}
{"text":"After reading reviews I was a little worried.  But I still went because I love the idea of it.  It was amazing. Anyone who complains needs to grow up.  Yes there could be a long wait it is a popular place.  But while you are waiting there is a lot to see and do.  From cornhole to shuffle board and food and drinks you should never be bored.  We only had to wait 20 mins or so and it was great.  Went as a group of 4 had a great meal and a great time.  I hope one opens closer to Los Angeles soon!"}
{"text":"it was really fun and the wings were amazing. the nachos were really yum. they managed to keep it cool outside while golfing and even helped us get a little better"}
{"text":"We were in town for the weekend and my hubby and I decided to take a quick lesson at Top Golf.  Ryan Livermore was our guy and he was simply amazing!  We both learned so much in just an hour.   Ryan was super professional, super knowledgeable and made me feel extremely comfortable while learning a new sport. The facility is fantastic....pools, shuffleboard, bars, restaurant, and a great atmosphere for a fun round of golf games with your friends. Thanks Ryan for the lesson.  It was great meeting you!"}
{"text":"We visiting on Opening Night (June 9) and LOVED it!!!  I honestly don't know what I can possibly say that hasn't already been said so I will keep it short and to the point. This place ROCKS!  I'm not a golfer and still thoroughly enjoyed my time there. The food is excellent, they have a great drink menu and the atmosphere is fun and fabulous! 

We had the pleasure of dining on the second floor and then drinking/playing on the third floor and both of our BayHosts were outstanding (Vanessa on the 2nd fl and Kyle L on the 3rd fl). They were both incredibly friendly and attentive. They knew the menu, made perfect recommendations, and they're engaging personalities genuinely made the whole experience that much better. 

My husband and I had the Hummus appetizer, a burger, and chicken nachos and we loved it all. Everything was served hot and fresh and was seasoned perfectly. 

We also had an opportunity to spend some time at the rooftop bar and the bar staff was also fantastic! They were just as entertaining as they were friendly. I was DD for the night so I only nursed a couple of Sangrias for my entire time there, but my husband had a few diff beers and another drink. Next time, he will be DD so I can get one of their signature Golf Bag drinks!  Everyone was raving about them!

One thing that my husband and I consistently noticed and commented on a number of times is how much the employee truly seem to like their jobs and enjoy working there. As CRAZY busy as the place was and the demand that was put on the staff, everyone that we came into contact with embraced the madness and passed along their excitement to the customers. Kudos to Top Golf for bringing this fun establishment to Charlotte and for obviously going out of your way to make it a fun and pleasant work experience for your employees. 

BTW...I can't wait to go back to try the breakfast menu!"}
{"text":"So much fun! It's complicated to check in for some reason, but once you get situated, it's a good time. Food is good too."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I love the fact that with your group you have your own booth/area/table, but also you can socialize with the others next to you. The food was great, especially the carne asada nachos! Also tried the sea bass sliders which were pretty good, the chips were a little burnt though. 

I have never golfed this way -- and i loved it! Super technical with the golf balls being chipped and being able to keep score if you were to get the ball in to any of the various holes. 

The staff was very helpful and accommodating. The only thing was our server kept forgetting / mistaking our orders. She did comp the sliders that took an hour to come out though, which was nice.

 It was definitely a fun, social experience and I would for sure do this again."}
{"text":"So maybe you shouldn't tell people to park in the mgm and that you will validate parking. I called ahead of time as we had reservations for my brothers 30th birthday party. I called and asked how the parking works, the agent that helped me said that we should park in the mgm grand since they are next door and they would validate parking or give game credits. Upon arriving at parking lot, we find out that it wasn't very close to the location and then we show up and it looks like there is a parking lot attached to top golf, I went in and asked if they could validate parking and the front desk was very rude asking me who told us that. I told them that I had called and I wasn't sure the agents name and maybe the name is Isaac, they told me that they were going to take care of this. Some guy named Isaac shows up at our bay and confronts me saying that he heard someone said that I said he told me to park at mgm and they validate ( now this wasn't isaacs fault it was the front desk) but I told Isaac that his voice didn't match who I spoke to and I was sorry that they had him come up to talk to us. First off I work in hospitality and this is not how you treat guests. They did nothing to resolve the isssue of telling me to park at mgm when they have their own lot, it seems like this place is telling people to park there so they can increase revenue for the hotel that they are affiliated with. I've never been so disappointed with an entertainment place. We also had to wait 15 minutes for our bay, we had reservations and were there early. Then our server tried telling us that we only had 5 minutes left, we the had to tell her that we didn't start on time, which she should have known as she was there when it happened 


Only go here if you feel like wasting money and trying to show off, or if you like getting treated like a stray animal"}
{"text":"Love coming to topgolf. Great service, helpful staff, and lots of fun. They even have a free shuttle to Talking Stick Resort which helps when the wait is long. Trey (our shuttle driver) was exceptional and gave us the inside scoop on good deals going at topgolf and how to use the shuttle. Always a great time!"}
{"text":"Super fun, change of pace date night. It's also a fun day activity with the family! Love the music, food & atmosphere!!

Awesome service too!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible. No reservations, no way to talk to anyone but a call center. Waited to come down here with my wife an 6 month old planned it just right only to find out its a 2.5 hour wait and it was 10 mins according to the call center.... what a total bust. Who doesnt take reservations but is family friendly.... llame"}
{"text":"If you are looking for something somewhat unique, this is definitely the place to be. Their facility is really cool and modern. They have about 3 different levels, the higher the level the more you pay to play golf. Each level has a bar so you never have to wait long to order a drink. The food and drinks are average for the strip, but they might be a bit high for locals. Mix drinks start at $14 and bottle service at $500. This place is like nothing here in vegas. They have a small area for a live band and a pool!! And the view at night time is awesome! This is a great place for all ages specially adults! There are tons of Tvs to watch the games, you can play bags, JINYA and even place bets at the sport's book. This place hasn't been open for long so there are still some issues, but hopefully they can fix them soon!"}
{"text":"Very awesome! Waitress with black and teal hair was the best and definitely worth coming back to get great service!!!! Sorry I don't know her name"}
{"text":"Visited this location with my husband on February 7 Saturday night. He is a great golfer and figured it be a good place to check out. Everyone was so upbeat and friendly. If you don't golf no problem. It's still a blast. The staff was extremely informative and welcoming. We were on the first floor bottom level because that's what was available but I didn't feel like it was a bad thing at all. I know I heard from people the top is the best but it was still a great experience. We were in lane 20 something pretty centered and I wish I could remember my servers name because I'd request him again (red haired guy I believe) because I'm so picky especially with my tequila and he was extremely accommodating and also helped us navigate the games and letting us know of events coming up. So we are sure to be back!"}
{"text":"Alexandra, \"Alex\" was absolutely amazing! She took such good care of us. By far the BEST service we've had when coming! She was attentive and so friendly! Our food and drinks were great, but the service made the entire experience perfect!"}
{"text":"This place continues to go down hill with their level of service.  If go into detail but there isnt enough space in this forum.  It starts at thr concierge desk and continues once you get into the bay.  I'd offer suggestions for improvement but doubt anyone cares to hear it."}
{"text":"10 stars, super fun!! We have been maybe 5 times all for different events. Birthday parties, work meetings, family gathering, couples date night and everytime we have more fun. No complaints. The food it awesome too!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is soooo good here. I recommend the edamame and the Asian wings. Some of the waitresses are smoking hot and super friendly! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I went to TopGolf for the exclusive pre-opening VIP event and I was NOT disappointed. My review may be biased because I didn't spend a fortune playing, but the employees, the atmosphere, and the customer service was top notch. There are pools on 2 separate floors at TopGolf and there are lounging areas as well. It's a lot like bowling, where you can put in the members who are golfing, it keeps track of points, and whose turn it is next, etc. There were a few occasions where we had to ask for assistance because we had technical difficulties with the system not working. That put a cramp into things, but I'm sure they were still working out some kinks at the time of the event.

I was told that you could reserve a bank starting at $40/hr, but that's all the information she gave us. I wasn't able to discern if that was a weekday/lunch hour special price or if that is inclusive of the weekends. From the other reviews I am reading, it sounds like it is a lot more than $40/hr. I would call to confirm before you head down if you are on a budget to avoid any surprises.

Overall, this place is fun, exciting, and the service from the team as great as well."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are delicious. I would have given 5 stars if it weren't for the parking lot. There are not enough parking spaces and maneuvering through the parking lot was almost dangerous. 

Once inside you forget how much of a pain it was to park and enjoy multiple unique seating areas. Bars throughout and games scattered around to play just in case your waiting for your bay. 

Also, some of the bays have high top seating. If you playing for awhile I'd recommend the couch style seating... much more comfortable."}
{"text":"This was my first time at top golf and it was surprisingly fun! I don't know how to golf at all and I was terrible playing it here but I think it's just a good spot to hang out with friends. There's plenty of TV's, food, drinks, and games to play. The wait was a bit much since there are no reservations when we went on a weekend - we waited almost 2 hours to get a bay in the lower level but the time goes by fast getting drinks, playing shuffleboard, and watching people fall off the mechanical bull! It's always entertaining watching people ride it :) It's nice to be outside of all the casinos in Vegas and get some fresh air out in the open at top golf so I feel like it's a good daytime activity to get you prepared for a long night out. Food was normal American bar food - we had flatbreads, sliders, tater tots, 2 bottles of red wine, and some beer. I would recommend coming here if you have some free time in Vegas - it's a chill place to hang out especially if you had a large group."}
{"text":"I am the Vice President of Product Marketing for Plantronics. We were launching a new set of products that we wanted to announce to our partners and customers. We needed a venue were we could have a first-rate meeting, show the products to our customers, but also something that might be different than a hotel ballroom. One of our team had heard of Top Golf and suggested it.

I was a little bit nervous because it is a non-traditional venue. I thought it might be too noisy and too distracting. I was also worried that the mix of professional and social might be off-putting to some of our customers. I was wrong.

We used the meeting room on the main floor. The AV facilities were first rate. There are lots of monitors and great overhead audio. We selected round tables all facing in. One of our presenters uses a wheel chair so we didn't want people seated too deep. The catering was very good. It was markedly better than typical hotel catering and more cost effective. The view from the room onto the field was superb but the black out curtains made sure it wasn't a distraction during our presentations. We did run into a small issue with hallway noise that was quickly rectified when we spoke to staff. We also noted that they weren't ideally situated for large equipment pack-in, pack-out. If this is something you need to do, I would have a storage truck in the parking lot and move in and out from there.

Speaking of staff, it was the staff that made the day. Thomas and Amber stood out as two people who just knew \"how to make it right\". The exceeded my expectations, not just by providing incredible, thoughtful service, but by caring about the success of our event. It felt very genuine. I have done a lot of events in any time, and I cannot recall enjoying working with a team so much. Of course there were many people on their team that were also involved --- too many to mention by name, but each person wanted to go out of our way. What's more, they weren't just doing this for us. I watched how they worked with the regular guests.  They really seemed to care. In any place, that would be amazing, but in this environment, it was especially unexpected and helped make our customers feel very welcomed.

Everyone enjoyed the social events of golf and pool. Being able to order food off me u rather than from some banquet list really kept everyone happy. The cocktails were a little premium-priced for straight up entertainment, but less than at a hotel venue. 

We were so happy with our Product Launch. Our customers and partners loved it. The staff really made it work well. A different attitude from the staff and I am not sure this venue would have been as successful.

Roadside signage isn't ideal. Some people noted it was hard to find. The building is obvious once you know what you are looking for. It is a beautiful facility.

We will use this facility again and we will also look at other locations for similar events."}
{"text":"Excellent service an accommodating when they make a mistake. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"The fact that Topgolf is coming to Socal literally makes me jumping mile high. This is such a fun casual thing to do with all ages, friends & family! 

90% of my crew didn't know how to golf (including myself) but we had an awesome time playing, getting drinks and laughing our ass off! 

The drinks are reasonably priced and food isn't half bad given the venue. 

Level 3 has a pool with bar seats where you can get a nice little cocktail and still stay in the poor enjoying a view of people driving. Seriously absolutely love this activity. Definitely need more of these popping up everywhere. 

Pro tip: parking is free :)"}
{"text":"The golf part was seriously lots of fun- our family all had a great time playing, but we waited close to an hour (literally) for our burgers that had hard buns like they had been sitting under a warmer for a long time; they really were pretty bad and everyone in our group's stomachs aren't feeling that great right now as I write this; everyone is very disappointed with that part. I had to ask our waitress 3 times to check on our food, and the 3rd time went to go find her and her manager was with her; he said he would check on our order (but didn't even apologize). It would've been nice if she took the situation in mind and (like most places that make that kind of mistake) offered to remove at least one of the burgers off our check, but she didn't. However, I will say the appetizers were good. Guacamole was outstanding - I mean really good. Overall, we had a good time, but it was SUPER expensive. Plan to bring your Platinum card. (The bill for 2 appetizers, 4 burgers, 1 turkey wrap, a couple sodas, and 7 adult drinks came out to $180- and that wasn't including the $45/hr golf bay rental, and we were there for 2-1/2hrs. So $300  overall (for 5 people)-- yikes! Expensive night!"}
{"text":"Personally, I enjoyed coming here to hang out with my friends who were visiting but the service to rider food was extremely slow. Getting the attention of someone to help you was quite difficult too. Otherwise, if you don't mind a potential wait, and are interested in golf, this is a trendy spot to come to!"}
{"text":"Esposa and I are familiar with TopGolf, as we frequent the San Antonio, Texas, location.  We dame here on Memorial Day weekend with a large group of 15 people.  No wait.  Quickly got adjacent bays.  Staff are very friendly.  Service is prompt.  Drinks and food are very good.  Ample parking.  Overall, a great experience.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing service, fun games, and a lot of great food and drinks. I had a great time even though I have never played gold a day in my life. The server was always there when we needed her and was not too overbearing! I loved hanging out and playing golf while also enjoying a well made cocktail!"}
{"text":"We came, we saw, we Topped some golfs from the mezzanine.
My lovely bride and I stopped in for a quick visit: I used to play at all manner of golfs but she only ever did the windmill kind so we figured she could have a go at whacking the small ball in a low pressure environment while I tried to find my swing. The signing up part was irritating and slow and had to be re-done because the cashier managed to misspell my name while holding my credit card (I didn't make a huge scene but really, my name is right there on the card)
We were escorted to the second floor and given the nickel tour of the hitting bay including club selection and how to choose games. I had topped some golfs in Austin when visiting my sister and had it mostly figured out but life is better when I don't have to try to remember anything but stand up and hit the ball (BTW: I'm pretty sure that the fields are reversed there-to-here and am also pretty sure it would matter if we were keeping score which we weren't but still...) Since we were just goofing around the scores and targets and aiming didn't mean much, my best girl got to come with and had some fun plus I got range time, sort of.
Kinda spendy but it isn't like we're going to do this every night. We hit some golfs, we lit some lights. We smooched, we giggled! Yea us!"}
{"text":"I've been to Topgolf before, and have organized events to have people join before as well. I have always had fun and a great experience.

Today I carried in my clubs to join a friend for her birthday party and we all had a very positive experience. We all laughed, ate, had a few drinks, and shared a fun time together. While wrapping up our visit, it was my turn to finish up my round. 

I grabbed one of my clubs, placed my ball on the tee, and in my back swing, some guy dressed in a football jersey yelled at me and told me that I couldn't use a hybrid or a wood. To a bunch of amateurs who rarely golf, and most of us had never been, we were all left confused with the interaction.  Without staying around to answer questions or clarify, he angrily told us to not use our own clubs and then left.  I honestly thought he was from the bay next to us, then realized he was an employee. We were all left standing there, kind of shocked. 

Nobody had said not to use our own clubs. Nobody had explained woods, hybrids, etc. that may seem elementary, but to those of us who don't golf regularly, it came across extremely rude. 

Our waitress was very apologetic, and came over and apologized to me and the group. The manager came and expressed similar sentiments. It was such an odd, out of place interaction. 

Overall it was a great experience, but for someone who is representing such a great company and establishment who is out of uniform to come and belittle, criticize, and then not try to professionally address the situation, it was very shocking. I can only hope that they move forward without him."}
{"text":"Took my 10-year-old at 9 AM, and we had a great time even though we are not golfers at all! (The prior afternoon, the wait time was 4 hours!)  the venue was fine for kids, service was friendly and attentive, and it was fun to hit golf balls in a relaxed setting. We had drinks and a bite to eat; food was good. We will probably visit every time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Called in ahead of time. Number is for their \"corporate office\".  Asked how long the wait was, couldn't give me an estimate. Drive 30 minutes to the location and are told it's a three hour wait. Pathetic customer service, no apology, a bunch of excuses"}
{"text":"Yep, so we've been at Topgolf for about 30 minutes now and have already experienced the worst in customer service from the bartenders. No surprise, I suppose, after the reviews we've read about this place. It seems pretty hit or miss depending on the day, time, or initiative of the staff. The dude that appeared to be at our end of the bar decided for some reason that he would rather talk with a couple of other dudes than attend to anyone else that clearly needed service. 

I can say, however, that the two different young women we spoke to at the reservation counter were friendly and helpful. 

Alas, we haven't even golfed yet. Hopefully, things will turn around and I'll be able to update my review with a fun and satisfying experience.

So, I'm adding a star and was tempted to add another. Super fun, and our waitress at our golf bay was great. Very friendly and accommodating. Definitely check this place if you have the time and are looking for something different!  We ended up only having to wait 45 minutes for our 3rd level bay  ($60/hr) and folded for an hour which was plenty for two of us. We only got a flatbread to eat, but it was delicious. 

Check out TopGolf Vegas, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night with a large group and had a lot of fun! Go to Topgolf for a more chill Vegas experience. Was perfect for me as I flew in Friday night and wanted to have some fun but not blow all my energy on night 1.

Topgolf is a driving range with circles/goals at several points on the course. You can play and try to get your ball into the actual goals to accumulate points or simply hit balls for fun. We got bottle service which was just like at a club..the waiters came out with signs and drinks! There's also all sorts of mostly bar food available. During warmer months, there's a nice mini-pool and lounge. Highly recommend especially for golf lovers!"}
{"text":"Topgolf is like a playground for adults! So much fun, grab a pitcher of beer, and swing some clubs. I suck at the whole golf part, but who cares? It's more like bowling - nobody is good, and nobody cares. The food isn't great (stick to the basics) but the drinks are great.

I even saw a bloody mary bar that had all the fixins - I will be back to attack that bad boy on my next trip!

The $1.00 card replacement thing is stupid, especially in this age of computers. Why not make an electric wallet item? We will overlook that for now."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place, staff seems to be a little confused when super. Yay but cool place to hang out with friends and hang out. Some people should not be swinging a club for others safety but definitely humorous."}
{"text":"Decided to go check this place out for my Birthday with my Husband.  They recently opened this location in Charlotte so I expected it to be busy.  There was a fair amount of people there for a Tuesday afternoon.

If you don't already have a membership then you have to wait in line and purchase a membership card.  This cost $5 per person and they ask for some personal information.  You only have to do this for your first visit and credits for play are added to it. 

We tried to use a gift card that we had and their system wasn't working.  The manager was called over and he could tell we were getting frustrated because we got there 20 minutes before the hourly rate increases and check in was taking long.  He apologized and was very polite.  To fix the issue he credited us two hours of play when we were intending to play one and gave us the gift card back. 

This was a very nice thing he did to make us feel special for my birthday and first visit.  

Now onto the play.  The clubs are included but you can bring your own if you want. The technology is top notch and the games are fun even if you aren't a golfer.  Our food and drink server was very nice and efficient.  

We ordered Moscow Mules, the Mushi and the Buffalo Chicken flatbread.  My Husband and I really enjoyed the flatbread and Mules.  The Mushi was good but we probably wouldn't order it again.  All in all we had a great time.  You will drop some cash at this place but the atmosphere and service make it worth it...we will be back for active fun and special occasions."}
{"text":"I love this place I come here all the time, although at night it's $45 an hour to golf, it is so worth it! The food is delicious! I love the mushi! Top Golf has such a great environment and the staff is so nice!"}
{"text":"I liked it more than I thought I would, but in the end this place is just bowling for people who are too fancy to bowl.

The environment and games definitely are designed for the Scottsdale and Gilbert crowd of suburbanites with too much time and money on their hands.

Surprisingly, food and drink prices weren't ridiculous. And some of the grub was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Making this review as I'm waiting here with my group of friends. Came here 15 minutes before the rush, and we were texted our booth for golfing was ready, checked in with the people in the front and they quoted us couple minutes to clean a table. We waited an extra 40 minutes after that, I asked the lady again what had happened with our table and assuming they accidentally gave it to someone else, she lied and said we were waiting for other people to finish up although a table had already finished? 
Anyways, our experience was unpleasant and we are leaving."}
{"text":"Ummmmmm yeah!!!! So from what I know there are 2 Top Golfs in the city, one in Scottsdale and one in Gilbert. I never had a chance to make it out to the Scottsdale one, but if its like the one in Gilbert, I finally understand what all the hype is about! This place is so much fun, whether you like to golf or not! There are 3 stories full of bays to golf from that are set up for single players or large group of players. They have a bar/seating area inside if you don't want to play golf or if you have to wait for a bay, you have something else to do. They also have an outside bar/seating area on the 3rd floor. If the place is packed like it was the night we went, they open up their banquet hall so people have more room to sit and eat.

Food - They have a really decent menu! Lots to chose from. Pizza, burgers, wings, tacos, salads....... yummy! I had their nachos and their buffalo chicken sliders! The nachos are delicious, large chips layered in your choice of meat, cheese, bean puree, this chimichurri sauce.... it was delicious! The buffalo chicken sliders were also very tasty! Spicy wing sauce, served with lettuce, tomato and ranch.

Atmosphere - Very fun, laid back, good for dates, singles and families

Service - Great service! The night we went a pro football player rented out the entire 3rd floor for a Gopro special, so it was packed! Not only was there enough staff to take care of peoples golfing needs, there was enough to greet people when we entered, exited, for valet parking, servers, bar tenders, everyone was on the ball and all smiles!

Overall we had a great time!! Cant wait to go back!

Good side note - You do have to purchase a one time golf card for $5 when you first go, you pay by the hour for your games. Each game is about 20 swings per person. If its your first time a concierge will walk you to your bay and help set you up."}
{"text":"Happened to make a last minute trip out to Vegas last Sunday and noticed this place had just opened, being a semi avid golfer I decided to try it out.

The facility is pretty awesome, very clean and lots of technology, plenty of room to hangout and eat and drink or play beer pong/corn hole. We came around 2 on a monday and there was plenty of people but no wait so we got a bay on the 2nd floor for an hour. The host and our server helped us get set up and playing in no time and then took our orders for drinks.

The games are pretty cool, there's a series of targets to hit at and your ball is tracked and you're awarded points for where you hit, had a fun time competing with my buddy for the best score. Drink service was quick and despite all the bad reviews we never had a problem with the technology.

My only complaint is the clubs they provide are not a full set so it made it difficult if you're a regular golfer to hit certain lengths, next time I'll bring my own clubs, had them in the car but didn't grab them this time. 

Try it out, I'll be back"}
{"text":"2 stars for the tight atmosphere! But .. 
Place is pricey, 2 hours of wait and they could only put us on the bottom area ?! Yeah .. not worth my money"}
{"text":"Such a fun spot for a day or night out with friends. You can reserve spots ahead of time (sometime it's an additional fee of $50!) or just wait for an opening. 

Our group of 7 decided to wait around, especially because there was an area downstairs with cornhole, a pool table, shuffle board, and other games. It was really nice to offer this area for guests who have to wait. We also ordered some beer and appetizers too for a hefty price. 

Our bay was ready for our group and we all had a great time! We're not the best golfers, so it was fun to try to aim for the various targets. Our server was friendly and attentive as well. 

Prices are not cheap, but if you come with a group of people, it'll be more affordable to split the cost. Overall, I'd definitely recommend a visit here! I wish there were locations in California!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, terrible service. I came with four friends on a non-holiday, Monday night. We were told there was a 45 minute to 1 hour wait, which was fine (there is plenty to do while you wait). We bought two rounds of drinks and played corn hole to pass the time. 1 hour later, I checked with the front desk and was told there were still 5 groups ahead of us. The girl at the front then pulled me aside and said, \"to be honest, we're so backed up because our staff doesn't want to do anything tonight.\" 

Classy.

There were plenty of bays open so we decided to stick it out. After 2 hours of waiting I checked with the front desk once again. This time I was told there is only one group in front of us. 20 minutes later and our group had enough so we left. 

Only positive was that we Ubered and didn't have to deal with the horrid valet service mentioned in most of the reviews on here. 

Won't be returning to this location. Ever."}
{"text":"I wanted to come with a group of friends and decided to try to make a reservation...you can do that by contacting private events.  They were really nice in explaining all of the cost and details.  For Saturday, during the day, you can book a bay with can accommodate 8-10 people (only 6 can play at a time).  They charged $100 /hour (2 hrs is the limit) and then a F&B of $375.  This does not include service and gratuity.  If you wanted it in the evening, the hourly increases to $125 and the F&B is over $400.  This may sound like a lot, but is the best way to bypass the line to get in.  Apparently it is not unusual to wait 2-4 hrs to come here.  We came at 2:30pm, still somewhat hungover from the previous night.  We tried our best to order food and drinks (mostly beers and red bulls) and had a difficult time meeting our minimum during the 2 hours.  We ended up asking for a bag and took like 8-10 cans of beers and redbulls home with us.
So this is a somewhat pricey option to entertain yourself in Vegas during the day.  We did have fun so I can't complain too much about the price.  overall bill was $680 for 8 people for 2 hrs..."}
{"text":"Top Golf is the best. When the weather is not too hot, it's just unbeatable. Mt wide and I have been there in the middle of summer, though, and with the monsters it wasn't really that bad."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Love it.  Ac rocks.  Great teachers. Parking is not there but at the hotel so be aware.  It gets 4 stars only because of that. Everything else rocks"}
{"text":"We took a work outing here and it was the best experience. Top of the line entertainment option for larger parties!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I've been going to the one in Chicago for years. Just got my membership. Perfect fun for business, friends, and family outings."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times now and I love the experience!

There are four levels with multiple bars (and different themes; my favorite is the Riv Bar), two pools, games, TVs, and of course, golfing bays. It is a very fun environment and I encourage a tour of the facility before you indulge. There's a lot to take in!

I have been in bays on the second and third floors, always toward the center. The outdoor furniture, sectional and coffee table, is relatively comfortable. It's a little difficult to eat and there's not much room for a group to dine, but it's manageable. Clubs for men and women are provided with details for novices. If you're left-handed, they'll provide appropriate clubs upon request and place a tee on the other side of the green. Each bay is equipped with three screens, two for your game to keep track of everyone's plays and one with television. You also have a dedicated server for food and drink orders.

The bays have heating lamps for the colder months and they're very warm. As for the hotter times, I've seen comments stating that bays are air-conditioned, but I was there twice this summer and I don't think it exists (I guess it's probably there, but it's terrible). Also, we couldn't locate the temperature controls (nor were we told about them) and the misters do NOT help when it's in the triple digits. One particularly miserable visit was when it was over 100F and uncharacteristically humid at 11PM. We thought going in the evening would be easier, but it was almost unbearable. Pro tip: The bathrooms are heavily air-conditioned and the perfect place to cool off. Oh yeah, the pool closes at 9PM. Boo!

Prices vary a lot depending on floor, day, and time. Floors 1 & 2 is $30-75/hour and Floor 3 is $45-90/hour. Nevada locals receive 20% off bay rentals, so it's $24-60/hour and $36-75/hour. There's also a 10% discount for military, police, fire, and EMS personnel. The best time (based on price) to visit is Mon-Thurs, 9AM to 12PM. Note: It's six people per bay.

They offer valet (complimentary when I was there in July) and there is on-site parking, however, it's frequently unavailable due to events and conferences (you'll notice the large tent overwhelming the parking lot). Another option is parking at MGM Grand and catching the complimentary shuttle that runs every 15 minutes or walking over (approximately 5-7 minutes).

Food: The menu is constantly changing, paying particular attention to seasonal ingredients, so it's always exciting. However, I've had to say good-bye to some favorite eats (though there's a possibility of dishes returning with their respective seasons). My all-time favorite dish is the Burrata because it had the most delicious grilled bread and tomato jam (I'm hoping it'll make a comeback!!). I also like the 7-Layer Dip, Deviled Egg Sampler (the steak one is the best!), and Chicken Boursin Bacon Flatbread. The Heritage Turkey Meatballs on the Summer menu is fantastic as well. My family and I ordered the Texas-Style BBQ Platter ($110) and it was great. It had SO much food; I especially liked the hot links, brisket, and variety of pickles.

Cocktails: Their Frozen Mule and Summer Frosé are really fun drinks and perfect for the heat. I liked the Pineapple Punch (Captain Morgan, Malibu, pineapple juice, and Monin Ginger), too. The latter is available in their souvenir golf bag mugs with club straws (super cute), 30 or 60 ounces ($20/$35)."}
{"text":"We had our first experience at Top Golf last Friday and we loved it!! We'll definitely be going back soon! We were on the 1st floor and our waitress was Savannah - she was AMAZING and very attentive to our group all night long. I would give her 6 stars if I could! Thanks for such a fun night, looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"This used to be a good place but their business sense has gone down the drain. We went there to celebrate but since my kid has bad food allergy we took her food with us. They kicked us out for bringing outside food. The manager Terri had no empathy on how the kid was feeling, and she lost close to $200 business that we were bringing to this place due to a policy that that has no exceptions. They ruined our entire evening which we were looking forward to. We understand policy but each policy has exceptions and this business was not willing to take care of their customers but rather stick to a policy. With this attitude this place will close down soon .  We have lived with food allergy for almost 5 yrs and most places are understanding but this was horrible . Top it all she was bragging of having 5 kids.. sad a mom of 5 kids can't understand the feeling of a kid.  Topgolf should know how their customers are being treated."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! The balls that you hit have a chip in them that gives you a number of statics for example speed and distance. The food is great and the suites are comfortable. Highly recommend this place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We held an event on 12/18/14 and had Chelsey, Bambi and Ashley h. As our servers. These girls gave us the best service ever!!!!! They exceeded our expectations we will definitely be returning for future events!"}
{"text":"First time visiting top golf, and also first time golfing in my life! Didn't know what I was getting myself into but every employee was helpful and very nice. Taryn the bartender was awesome and really made me and my friends feel welcome. 

We ordered drinks, the turkey avocado wrap with tater tots, burger with fries and for dessert the donut holes that you fill with chocolate, Bavarian cream, and raspberry. Everything was really awesome! Avocado was very fresh and the donuts were out of this world! 

Top bays were definitely the best bet, will surely return for the service and fun times! 

5/5"}
{"text":"Great place to go and have a good time. Service is excellent food is great. Our server Hannah M was fantastic I highly recommend this for any gathering. Customer service is EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"Love this place! So much fun! I would say come before noon for the best prices! Lots of different games you can play that are fun. The food is delicious and the drinks are awesome! I would recommend this to anyone who hasn't gone here. So much fun!"}
{"text":"This place is so fun! They charge by the hour (similar to bowling) and up to 6 people can golf at one time. Up to 10 people can sit in a bay, but it's pretty crowded at that point. Just get two bays if you have more than 6 people.

The food is amazing!!!! Please go for the back yard wings, rock shrimp and the donut holes for dessert-- they will blow your mind!

I love how the first and second level are for all ages and the third and fourth level is for 21+. It makes it more of a party atmosphere!

This place is perfect to hang out with friends, a a date, with family and/friends. I love it and I'm so happy something like this is in Las Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"We have a blast every time we come here, from my nine year old son to my  50yr+ parents! Prices are reasonable and there's plenty to keep everyone entertained even while you're waiting for what at first seems too long for your bay. The wait has never been as long as they quote, but either way we're having a great time by the time it's our turn and it keeps on going. Friendly staff, good drinks, decent food, what more do you need?"}
{"text":"Well, we were greeted with this comment, \"You don't have any drivers in that bag, do you?\" Well, of course we did as it was advertised as a driving range! They confiscated the drivers and allowed us to use irons. We were absolutely astonished to see that the rates were $35.00 per hour , but figured it would be good to try it just once since we are from out of town. We tried to pay and then were asked if we would like a lifetime membership card. My husband said no because we knew we wouldn't be coming back there. The saleslady saId that it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. We asked what advantage the membership was and she said nothing, but it was HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. WE said that no we didn't want the lifetime membership card for $5 and so she said we could pay the $35.00 an hour for the range, but we could not hit our irons because one of us had to have the lifetime card. So, we asked if the card was required, she again said, no, that it was HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Are you seriously kidding me? You know, if the place was upfront and honest about telling us that it would cost $40.00 for the first time and $35.00 for any other times, we might have stayed...but when you lie and mislead the public, I will have no part of your establishment. So, no. I cannot give this place a good review because they lack integrity--pity, because it was a nice looking place."}
{"text":"We showed up last night to Top golf Scottsdale and it was an hour and a half wait.   No problem,  we get it BUT, We were told to buy a membership card and to come back tonight and with that card they would \"get us right in!!\" That's what she said!! We show up tonight and the guy says 2hrs!  We told him, but it's not on him,  i get it.  Don't have her name but, liar! Must make commission off all the phony cards you sell.  First time we had been and only because we had our kids in from out of town."}
{"text":"Best Too Golf we have been to! Service was friendly, food was fast, and the place is beautiful (and super clean). Five stars driven by the service piece, and the food quality. The staff that waited on us was just extremely pleasant. Every one of them, down to the food runners. It really made our experience."}
{"text":"This place is Uhhh-Mazing.   Who doesn't love to throw back a Few drinks while summing their inner Tiger Woods!!   Staff was exceptional and couldn't have been more professional and courteous to answer all questions and put on a demo for first timers.  

The food is quite delicious so don't be skeptical.  This is a great night out and you will have lots of fun. Don't feel like you need to be a Tour Pro to enjoy your night.  Keep in mind, \"Everyone sucks at golf, others just wear better gear\". Don't be discouraged and swing away."}
{"text":"This is my first time being in a place like this and my very first time playing golf. So by no means I consider myself an expert in this field. However, I will say that even if you are not an avid golfer you can still have a good time at this place - I know I did and the rest of my friends did as well. The atmosphere was great, it reminded me of a high end bowling alley (very similar concept). The facilities were phenomenal and the vies were on point. The only things that I'm not a big fan of is that is very expensive to play here, it cost us about $130 for an hour and a half of gameplay for six people. We only got a chance to play one game (20 balls each). That's not talking into account any food, drinks, nor tips!

Also, if you are planning to play in the fall and winter - bring a good coat! The heating systems that they have at this facility suck! We were freezing for the entire hour and a half that we're playing!"}
{"text":"What a genius concept! I remember being dragged to the range by my dad when I was 7 and hating it. If this was around in my youth could I have been a pro by now? Seriously, fun for everyone, experienced or not. The twinkle of the talking stick casino in the background adds to the ambiance. The boys competed for the far white and blue circles in the back, it was my moms and sisters first time holding a golf club so they aimed for close red and yellow circles (and were able to) and for a middle of the road (like me) I aimed for the green. We had such a great time we ended up staying 3 hours. I think we had a pretty awesome spot; bay 309 if anyone is interested. The drinks are strong and their food is consistent with dressed up bar food. I will definitely be keeping this in mind for group outing or random date night in the future."}
{"text":"Met family members there tonight for some fun. When. We arrived we were told that we would have to create a membership and that would cost us $5.00. Had fun but the service was slow, ordered fries and drinks that took forever to come out. There was also some glitches with setting up the memberships and neither my wife or I received our cards that you use to log in. We were charged $10 for the membership and when I asked about our cards I was told don't worry you can get new ones or we can look you up by your phone number. Also you will get an email with your number. I have not received a number and they can't pull my membership up by my phone number. Seems they need to fix the system or hire people that know how to set up a membership properly."}
{"text":"Amazing facility. Super fun. HOWEVER, the parking is WAAAAAY too small. Literally no where to park. This is a sign of how busy/successful they are but still seems like a major oversight and if not corrected be a huge problem for their ongoing business."}
{"text":"Cons: 
Scoring system can be glitchy.
Not enough parking
Expensive!! The pricing system (pay by the hour) is kind of a scam - the system is pretty slow and there's lots of wasted time. More importantly, when you try to extend the time, you have to add \"credits\" to your account and can only do so in certain increments. An hour and a half is $52 but you can't add that amount (have to add $75)!
Bathrooms have only one towel dispenser and waste baskets are consistently overflowing.
Food takes a long time to arrive and is luke warm.
No 5 irons
The \"nachos\" are basically a pizza

Pros:
Fun time for groups!
$3 tots are good and good value
Reasonable drink and food prices
$5 mandatory membership is reasonable"}
{"text":"Love the experience, service, and the food was tasty, although we only had the pretzel charcuterie board. My only complaint is that the space inside was boring and cold. Not at all what you'd expect for a Vegas establishment. It's like they designed a cool ceiling then forgot about the walls, floors, and space planning. Luckily the real fun is outside. I also wish they had a bigger shop. I have a lot of golf lovers in my life and although I don't buy many souvenirs, I would have here."}
{"text":"Cool hangout spot. Mediocre drinks and food. Just come here for kicks. Again....cool hangout spot for parties or 4 or more."}
{"text":"lotta fun. good service food was top notch."}
{"text":"It was a lot of fun, even for someone who doesn't like golf. We had about a 45 minute wait at around 8pm on a Saturday, which was to be expected, but the bar service was quick and watching the other people golf made the wait go by fast. It isn't just a driving range since they have electronic greens that are illuminated and you choose different game types from the computer at your table and try to hit the specific targets for points. You pay by the hour and there were four of us there for drinks and appetizers. We paid for two hours which went by pretty quickly. My suggestion is to pay for at least three hours for four or more people, especially if you will be ordering more food than we did. You also don't need your own clubs since they provide them there."}
{"text":"So much fun and experienced the best customer service! Everyone was so nice and the food and drinks were great. Will defiantly be back when I'm in town and have already recommended this place to several people who live in or visit the area frequently."}
{"text":"The golf should be what brings you here.   The food is terrible.  My hubby said he could find better food at a 7/11.  The pork belly chilaquiles had maybe  5 bits of pork.   Everything else was chips and salsa.   The sticky bun skillet was burned black... and they still served it!  We asked for a replacement and it was slightly less dry.  Oh! What they list online for food options is not what they serve.   The didn't even have the skillet cookie, even though it was on the menu.   They give you a $10 off coupon but make it darn near impossible to claim."}
{"text":"This is a great place for families or groups of people.  My kids loved this place and could have hit balls all night long.  We ordered apps and they were average.  The service was decent.  Golf is run on a timer and there were a couple of times we wanted to extend our time and found it difficult to track down waitstaff to help us.  I am giving it four stars because this is a very cool concept.  I wish we had these in MN."}
{"text":"I will admit the first time I was told I was going to Top Golf I wasn't very excited. I am not a golfer and don't usually enjoy sport themed evenings. I rejoiced when our birthday party of 12 called for a reservation and was told it was a 3 hour wait. 

The second time I was told I was going to Top Gold I knew I wasn't getting out of it. We were going for a corporate team builder and had about 25 people in our group. Once we arrived I was amazed at the size of the place and that it was packed full on a Tuesday night. There are 3 stories of bays (private couch areas that fit about 6 people). The bays come stocked with both male and female clubs and a screen similar to a bowling set up where you can enter in your names and select the games you want to play.

I will admit when I am wrong, I had a blast! The service was awesome, we had someone come over and explain how to play and we quickly ordered cocktails and got started. The server kept everyone on a separate tab which made paying the bill at the end of the night a breeze.

The food was not bad, we did buffet style fajitas with rice and beans. It wasn't the most flavorful but pretty decent for a buffet and the focus here isn't really on the food. 

I didn't score the highest but I had a fun time trying. Even if you are not a golf fan I would recommend this as a fun outing for large groups."}
{"text":"If you like any of the following things, then chances are you will like this place:
- Golf
- Fun
- Bars
- Food
- Competition
- Friendship
- Smiling
- High Fives
- Ranch

If you don't like any of those, then you might need to take a good long look at your life. Or you might be a vampire. Or dead.

Either way, this is basically a sports bar meets a three-story driving range, which, yes, is about as cool as it sounds. I don't even like playing golf and I had a good time. The food was pretty typical, but the drink selection was better than your average sports bar. My only real complaints would be not enough seating in the private golf areas and a little too long of a wait time in between server visits.

Again, worth checking out if you're looking for a fun, unique experience with a good group of friends."}
{"text":"TopGolf Vegas is top notch!

With any new concept, the developer(s) get to create how everything should look and work. The masterminds behind TopGolf nailed this. They have thought of every detail, and have created a world class entertainment concept and venue.

The technology is amazing. The golf balls are programmed so that they can be tracked back to the bay that they were originally hit from. The computers quickly capture and score where each ball stops. The targets are big, and hitting in the general direction will usually score some points. Setup and game play is pretty straight forward.

The food and drinks were fantastic. Our group shared two sampler platters. One had beef, chicken, and pork on skewers. The other was a sushi platter. Service was outstanding. The staff was prompt and constantly checked on us.

TopGolf locations are popping up all over the country. I'm excited that one is coming soon to Birmingham, Al. I  hope it is as good as the Vegas site."}
{"text":"This place is state of the art and fantastic! This coming from a girl who definitely doesn't golf and has only attempted the driving range once in her life. (That resulted in me being really sore for like 3 days.) My boyfriend works in the golf biz and we'd been watching the construction on this place like hawks for months. So glad it's finally open and so close to where we live!

We went during their soft opening last night. I know the first few days of a business being open can come with dealing with kinks, but all staff/service/amenities were completely up to par (GOLF PUNS!) and beyond. We were never left wanting for anything. Our gal came around plenty of times for food orders, drinks, refills and was awesome. She was also really knowledgeable about what they didn't quite have available on the menu, since they aren't 100% fully open to the public yet. A great touch. (Also? The bathrooms were PRISTINE.)

The food was pleasantly and surprisingly great. I had the nachos, which consisted of individual tortilla chips covered in \"drunken beans\" and topped with multiple cheeses (yes, queso dip is involved) and green and red jalapenos with servings of guac and pico for dipping. It was completely delicious. Boyfriend ordered the \"mushi\" (think mexican pin-wheel/sushi remix) that he said was outstanding and way more filling than it looked. I had two glasses of delicious and surprisingly strong strawberry/mint sangria that set us back $5 apiece. WHAT?

So, onto the actual reason of Topgolf: Golf games! Like I said, I don't participate but boyfriend and guys we were with loved it. It seemed glorious. You can either bring your clubs or used the standard ones they provide (for both men and ladies!) and choose between different games, i.e., hitting 5 balls in a row into each massive lit-up target on the range, hitting 1 ball into each target, distance competitions, etc. Each bay is fitted with a TV that follows your score and tracks your balls.

An aside: The view is freaking ridiculous. Camelback behind you, Talking Stick in front of you (which is all lit up in dancing neon lights now--I'm guessing they realized they have to make it look sweet with all the people staring right at the place while they hit balls.) All in all, this is such a fun place, and different than anything else available in the area for an afternoon/night out. Will it become super crowded/overrun with drunks during spring training? Absolutely! Will we totally enjoy ourselves during all other times of the year? Yes!"}
{"text":"Overall a really classy and affordable way to have fun in Vegas that isn't the same ole gambling and see a show experience. Get a group together, because depending on the day of the week, your price is per group, and when it is split it is really affordable! 

If you don't play golf don't fret (I sure as heck don't) - check out the adults bar and pool Lounge area on the 3rd floor! It's where I spent most of my time while the guys golfed. Great Loungers and cabanas by the pool, and the place wasn't crowded at all!

Our servers were great, with the exception of Bryce at the swim up bar. He got a little snooty when I asked if I could order drinks in the pool and have them charged to our table. OBVIOUSLY while I am in the pool in your swim up bar that you provide, I am not carrying cards or cash on me. It only makes sense to charge them to the table. He begrudgingly did it, but it came off as rude to me (and I have 8 years of service and bar tending experience). The rest of the staff was great, and so accommodating with our separate bar bills and confusing last names.

Lastly, the food we had was great! We ordered the rock shrimp, the edamame, and the donut holes. I would go back for all three - they were yum! I was rather surprised at the quality and effort they put into the food there.

I definitely see myself coming back here again. It's nice to have other things to do in Vegas but still have a great time - and from families to adult drinking groups this place is sure to please everyone."}
{"text":"Returned again after a long wait. Sat at the bar just to be ignored by the bartender. Gerry i think his name was. Sat there over 20 minutes before ordering a beer, finally got the beer 10 minutes after that. Maybe 6 people sitting at the bar. It was a tuesday night for christs sake. Not busy at all. Worst service ever. Will remember to drive an extra 20 minutes to go to gilbert. They know good service. Pathetic."}
{"text":"Good family entertainment and great customer services. Recommend anyone with or without kids. You can eat and drink great for groups. Beautiful facilities. Tons of fun."}
{"text":"Sorry, Top Golf. You're probably a victim of your own success. You're just too popular. I don't begrudge you for that, but you're refusal to take reservations translates into a waste of time when trying to patronize your establish. I can't recommend anyone wasting their time and their travel to be told about a 3-hour wait. Kudos on the concept. Zero stars on the experience."}
{"text":"When you arrive if you listen closely you can hear the sound of them printing money. I was fortunate to attend on a corporate reservation so I didn't have to wait and I didn't have to pay so that probably influences the review a bit. The food was excellent and loved the local beer choices. I had great company, met new friends and played the games pretty well using the Topgolf clubs. Service was fantastic. Next time I would bring my own clubs though."}
{"text":"Topgolf was an awesome experience! What a cool idea! I had never been to a driving range and I feel like this one really set the bar high..so maybe I won't go to a normal one...ever!
We stayed for an hour and a half, and ordered the Kalbi tacos (soooo delicious) and a few beers. The place is clean and feels brand new, the staff are very helpful and friendly, and the experience is totally awesome. I'd recommend coming during their \"off\" times (cheaper by $15-60 depending on what floor you get). There was a very minimal wait for the first floor so we opted for that.
The next time we come here (we will definitely be back) I would love to try it at night and on a higher level, but the difference in price at peak times really made it worth our while to opt for the cheaper level to get more time on the range.
We were told they're opening a Topgolf in LA too! Can't wait to visit that one too!"}
{"text":"Top Golf is a very modern \"bowling alley\" for golf. You are able to play target style games at a driving range. The big up side is having your own pit style dining directly at your tee with a waitress and TV entertainment. There are numerous bars and restaurants and places to hang out.  Even a pool if interested. We paid $60 per hour and got drinks and lots of food for two hours   We spent about $100 each with four people..  I recommend giving it a try.."}
{"text":"Such a fun place, the golf games & cocktails make for a fun evening out. They have something for everyone. Video games, pool tables, golf games, food & drinks. Always seems to be a wait to get in, so plan ahead."}
{"text":"I was staying at the MGM for a group event (Arbonne Global Training Conference) and had to change our team party venue last minute. My husband and I had eaten lunch at Top Golf (the seasonal Watermelon salad was super yummy and filling), we decided to just ask if there was anyway we could have an event there THAT NIGHT. Lauren Croner, the event Sales Manager, went above and beyond and made it happen! Not only that, the service was incredible, including have champagne and glasses ready to go. Worth every penny! You never know what you're going to get when in Vegas, but we were impressed with the venue, experience, and service. I highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Top Golf is meant for drinking only.  It is not meant to practice golf.  This place is a total joke.  YOU CANNOT HIT YOUR DRIVER, FAIRWAY WOODS OR HYBRIDS.  You can only use your irons.  I bought a Groupon and no where does it say irons only.  Call the driving range and they tell you NOTHING ABOUT IRONS ONLY.  I guess some genius didn't figure out that if you are on the top floor some balls will fly over the net at the end.  You can tell this place is poorly run, step inside and you would be hard pressed to find anyone to answer your questions.  I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU STAY AWAY FROM THIS JOKE OF A GOLF OUTLET.  If you want to drink and wait for your drink, go right ahead."}
{"text":"Great place for everyone to have a good time!
Love the music and it's cool no matter what age"}
{"text":"What a fantastic place.  Celebrated my son's 13th birthday here.  Food was out of this world!"}
{"text":"Whether you want to 'play' or are serious about working on your swing and ball control - TopGolf is your solution.  The evening experience is a melting pot of the cosmic bowling atmosphere, games similar to darts, but with golf clubs.  Erin and Shawn have touched on this side of TopGolf entertainment in their reviews.

The daylight hours are a great experience as well.  Remember the old saying about mullets - \"business on the top and party in the back\"?  Some are there to have fun, but If you're there to seriously work on your game you will have service better than you'd receive from TCP, Troon or others  The staff are outstanding ( I've had six different bay hosts/hostesses and recommend Valerie or Victoria).   I'm there to work on my game, so the games have little value to me; however, they come in handy for when you are working on placement.  

Now, here's the rub - the pricing is really reasonable for the group of 4 to 6 looking for a couple hours of entertainment.  It's not for the individual.  But wait!!!  They have memberships that you can sign up for that the monthly fee is roughly equal to playing for four hours on a pay as you go basis.  They're broken down into three types:

1. EARLY DRIVE - $80/month and you enjoy unlimited range time from 9am to noon, Monday through Friday.
2. LATE NIGHT DRIVE - $100/month and from 10pm to close, Sunday through Thursday, you can play unlimited.  Spend 2.5 hours during this timeframe without a membership would cost you $100 bucks; so, its great for good entertainment on evenings other than Friday and Saturday.
3. DAILY DRIVE - $150/month gets you the unlimited play during the middle of the day to early evening, plus a bonus of $200 in credits towards other time slots.

You won't realize just how reasonable these memberships are until you go and experience TopGolf for yourself.  Whether you are young or old you'll have a great experience!"}
{"text":"For what topgolf is I never would have expected the food to be as good as it was. Beyond impressed. Their Bloody Mary was delicious, oh and the golf aspect is really fun. My husband is the golfer. I went just to wack balls haha. It was great and the price is perfect."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Top Golf. The staff was friendly & accommodating. It's a     fun place to go and hangout with a group of friends. We will surely be back for another round."}
{"text":"Not for golfers, would be great entertainment for the \"Bachelorette Parties\"  but not for anyone who actually plays. Decent drink prices but given a couple weeks most of the staff will be unemployed 
Tried to give Top Golf another chance on 6/19 the valet was an #EpicFail so I didn't waste my time staying."}
{"text":"5 stars on concept alone! Excited this came to Scottsdale! Was so excited to go! A good friend birthday was finally an excuse. Sad she had to come down early to put her name in and then was bumped. ( No calling ahead to reserve) Good thing she is super laid back. Weird they didn't comp anything for her. There is a huge bar when you enter which help aid the wait and then bumping her out of wait list. Back drop ( have a photo shoot if like) to feel like you are a celeb! Ha! Reminded me of bowling but so much cooler. Pay $5 to get membership card. Then rent bay ( think lane if you were bowling) by the hour. Good music, misters and the servers bring you drinks. A few times got a tab before a drink which was odd. Had to also visit the bar if you are super thirsty...I am no golfer but can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great place to hit a few balls. The place is filled with interesting and gorgeous women, they have great food, they offer beer buckets, and you can hit a few balls....what else is there to want???! Everyone on the staff was helpful and it was genuinely refreshing to just get out of the casinos and try something else. It's a bit hot out at 110 + but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome experience from top to bottom. This place is made for the first time golfer to the experienced pro. Brand new facility that has the feel of a lounge with drinks, music, lounge seating and great service. Dragged my wife here and now she wants to come back tomorrow. Food is good, drinks are great and atmosphere is awesome."}
{"text":"Top golf Vegas was amazing!! We played at night and then came back the next day for more! We sat by the pool and had drinks and food at the bar! Beautiful design great drinks and food"}
{"text":"Great place for an outing. It has TopGolf and a great bar/restaurant. It was great to be able to order while playing Topgolf and eat between turns. Great food, great fun. Thoroughly enjoyable. Will definitely return soon!"}
{"text":"This place has rapidly gone down. Wait times of up-to 2 hours with priority for some platinum holders. The service hits a new low with missed orders and delays. Incidentally they also dropped water on my friends mom and had the audacity to laugh. I don't recommend this place to anyone.."}
{"text":"Best #Beer #Fun #TopGolf
Great place for parties, family outings or hanging with friends!!"}
{"text":"What an awesome addition to the already long list of things to do in Vegas! We were here for a work trip and it beats having a boring sit-down company dinner. Great way to hang out, play some friendly (and competitive!) rounds of golf, drink and eat.

There are three levels here and the third level has a swimming pool. The entire floor was booked for a private event so I haven't seen it myself, but how dope does that sound? Also, our hostess informed us that it can get very busy with a 4-hr wait here, but luckily, we were seated right away.

It's set at an hourly rate and each person gets a membership card. There are golf clubs for both men and women and a list of games to choose from. Each golf ball has a microchip that can record where it lands to accurately track the score.   I found that cool af. We had a few issues getting the game set up and some problems with the player rotation, but Lela was sure to get it resolved as soon as possible.

Food was also good! Our favorites were the rock shrimp and the sliders. I would recommend checking this place out if you wanted to do something different in LV."}
{"text":"So much fun! Wish there was a Topgolf in So Cal. Well run, good food, and amazing facilities."}
{"text":"I gotta admit, Its nice having somewhere fun to go to on those nights when you just don't wanna do the same old bar scene anymore. You can only play big buck hunter so many times before you want to smash the screen in with that plastic gun. I'll get you one day you big buck....ahem...but I digress....The golfing games are very fun and even those who have never golfed in their lives would be welcomed here. Great spot to just hang out for a few hours and hvae some drinks with friends while making a fool out of yourself. You can either really impress your friends or completely leave them in stitches all based off your golf swing. Keep that in mind fellas if you are bringing a girl you want to impress. Drinks are strong, food is good, atmosphere is nice. Lost a star because of long long lines and a little bit of incompetence encountered with concierge, but besides that cool spot."}
{"text":"You call you check the website. You drive long and far to go to top golf and they post outside private event and you can't golf but you can stand at the bar. Meanwhile the whole third floor doesn't have a single person. They only rented first and second floor. Not surprised they don't have good reviews. Great waste of time"}
{"text":"I've been to Top Golf a few times now and every time I'm a little more disappointed. The food was super overpriced and very very mediocre. $48 for an hour is a bit much. Overall I'd say just avoid it."}
{"text":"We were greeted with top notch professionalism smiling face and general kindness from  Kinya. The staff was very knowledgeable, friendly and answered all and any questions asked. John the manager took time to tell my 10 year old son about the game and he personally went to get him child size clubs. Meressa our server was super friendly attentive and food arrived in less than 15 minutes. Great vibe, super clean and overall positive fun atmosphere ! Trick is arrive early or if you have a group of 9 make a reservation. We will be coming back for sure ! Was a great way to spend our family Sunday Funday! We will be back for sure !!!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good at best, the facilities are pretty high-tech and the restrooms are actually CLEAN!! Thats pretty rare in a place that busy. It was swarming when I came with hubby and the inlaws. We did wait a while, which was frustrating since they seem to have an entire empty floor at the top (but I guess its a \"VIP\" only). Drinks were good. Bartenders know what they're doing there. Came out fast. Our server... Ana (one n... we had a talk about that.. lol!!). The reason why I would return. She's so funny. I wish all employees were so happy. It seems that most just don't want to be there. Overall I do recommend it. Good food, great drinks, awesome service."}
{"text":"Fun place to go while in Vegas!   We were tired of the same old thing while in Vegas, so we decided to check this place out and had a blast!  It made a 'golfing range' a little more interesting because of the different games you could play!  There are chips inside each ball and when you hit it  and lands, the chip sends it ls location back to the computer and \"scores\" that ball!  Really neat!  The place is a little pricey and you have to purchase a one time membership.  We would return, but probably with a larger group to help lower the cost!"}
{"text":"Wow. I have always heard this place was amazing. But I had no idea it would be as incredible as this. What a fun place. Drinks and food are plentiful and standard. But the golf facility is amazing. The range is amazing. The format for a group is really interactive and fun. This is the perfect spot for a group of friends, bachelor/ette party, family. Tons of fun. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a ton of fun, even if you don't know how to golf!  Check it out, I doubt you'll be disappointed!  Go on weekend nights for a party atmosphere or during the daytime for a chill vibe."}
{"text":"Such a great time! Whether it's a work function or out with friends to let loose- you won't be disappointed! Amazing!"}
{"text":"I am writing another review on Top Golf due to my choice to go back and try it again. My first experience was not a good one. I received a reply from someone at TopGolf apologizing for their poor performance during my first visit. After 7 months I decided to give them another shot. I now feel they deserve 5 stars. We arrived and signed up for a 1 hour tee time. There was about an hour and a half wait but we killed time playing the shuffleboard and other free games they have in the dining area. After about the stated wait time they called us and brought us to our golf station. The attendant really took his time to make sure we were  told how the whole thing worked ,TVs, variety of games , scoring , etc. We had food arrive right before they called us to our station and the staff was very helpful in transferring all of it from the table to our station. The golf itself was lots of fun and the whole Fam enjoyed it, both my son and his mom had never hit golf balls before and they loved the experience. The food was very good as well , get the pretzel appetizer, very good Thanks for improving on your operation and I'm glad I decided to return and give you another chance. We will be back"}
{"text":"Food is still top notch!  Fun environment for my visiting family and the kids. Lexi, our server was very helpful and had an excellent personality!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday evening with my boyfriend and two friends. Haven't been to top golf before so I was pretty excited. We purchase 1 hour for $60. First of all, when you get to your hitting bay, they make each person in your party sign up on the computer. 

THEY START YOUR TIME RIGHT WHEN YOU BEGIN TO SIGN UP.

First of all, it takes FOREVER. The computer was saying error for some reason and in total it took almost 15 minutes for all of us to register before even starting to play yet.

We ask someone about it and they said it shouldn't start until you hit your first ball. 
But it did. And they didn't do anything about it. We asked different people too. Wtf? That's extra time that we could have to play. 

So then. We're playing for a bit. I order a Guinness  and my friend ordered a Heineken from one employee that came over. TWENTY minutes later a different person comes over and says oh you guys ordered a Guinness and Heineken right? We say yes. 10 minutes later, a different girl comes back and says so you guys ordered a Guinness  and Heineken? And we were like yeah but never mind now our time is up cancel our order. 

What the f?? 

So now our time is up and I'm sitting here super upset. We've been waiting for our check for the longest time. Then, this girl finally comes over and says, \"oh are you guys done? Let me bring your check.\" 

TWENTY MINUTES LATER;

a DIFFERENT girl comes over and says hey is everything okay? And I'm like no nothing is okay. I've had a horrible time here. Then a new group of people come over to our hitting bay because they're playing there. And we're sitting down chillin waiting for our check. Then we get kicked out and have to go stand. Why accept a new group to the hitting bay if we didn't even get to pay yet? We have been waiting for SO long. 

So on top of how mad we already are we are even more furious that we can't even get a check and leave.

DO NOT COME HERE. Go to a different golf range."}
{"text":"Pleased to be nearby such a fun place to get away enjoy great food, entertainment, and meet new friends!"}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate a friends birthday. I have never been, but I hear a lot of people talk about this place so I was pretty excited to finally experience it! 

We came on a Saturday and it was extremely busy, which is I guess the norm for this place. Top golf is basically a bowling alley for the golfer in you. They have what they call \"bays\" or \"lanes\" compared to bowling lingo. It's 3 stories and each story has a bar and a row of bays along the edge. Each golf ball has a little chip in it, which is how they can keep score within your group. They serve all kinds of bar food and drinks and yes kids are allowed to come here, I was under the impression that it was adults only but no I noticed a lot of children and babies, I wouldn't bring my children here on a weekend night why?  so many drunks!

We had a 3 hour wait for a bay, so we decided to chill at the bar/lounge on the 3rd floor. We ordered cheese fries, bacon cheeseburger, calamari, and guacamole and chips. I wasn't very impressed with the food at all! The guacamole was definitely the instant packet guacamole either that or they over did a certain spice on our order. Cheese fries lacked a lot of flavor, and don't even get me started on the bacon cheeseburger that came with no cheese. The food takes FOREVER to arrive that honestly you're so hungry you can't complain on how much flavor it lacks. I ordered a Moscow mule and it was quite delicious so thumbs up for that! 

By the time we got into our bay I was exhausted! I was ready to go home! Our server for our bay was pretty nice, but extremely slow. It took 20min for an order of water to arrive. 

All in all its a pretty cool concept, but in my opinion it is little too over hyped. I would definitely only visit during weekdays not a weekend NEVER AGAIN.  Unless I make reservations ahead of time. Service was ok, extremely slow. I mean if you know your business is extremely busy on certain nights I would think they would at least be fully staffed and prepared to accommodate all of their guests. The food  was not good at all for the price I was expecting something better."}
{"text":"Had a great time here for a friends birthday. Plenty of golf games for all skills types. Plenty drink options and plenty of food options. It is a little pricey but would definitely be back with friends."}
{"text":"Had a great time with my husband and step son CJ! Played two rounds in 90 minutes. Won the second round!
Nachos and a pitcher of beer was just enough! I highly recommend for anyone!"}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night after playing at the Casino down the road hoping the wait wouldn't be too long. Rookie move... Unfortunately, the wait time was approximately 3 hours, and was 170 minutes more than we were willing to wait. The price per Bay is cheap with multiple players, the food and drinks were reasonably priced, the facility was nice, the environment was lively, and the staff was friendly. Just need to plan accordingly and expect to wait for a while next time I come during the weekend."}
{"text":"Fun place. Ur their attempt to have an and here is terrible! Can't hear the person sitting next to me. Topgolf is fun when you can enjoy the people you are with.    
Service is great though"}
{"text":"We went with a group of 12 on a Tuesday morning.

We had the best time! Ample parking, modern and tons of seating and space.

You get a card, clubs and a brief rundown of the rules. The bar menu and snacks kept everyone happy too.

There are also cornhole, a giant jenga set and fooseball too.

Definitely a good place to bring out of town guests or clients."}
{"text":"Confession- My brother and roommate said \"See ya, Liz. We're going to TopGolf!\" To which I replied. \"I love that place! That's the restaurant with golf right?\" To which they laughed and said \"Um more like golf with a restaurant.\" 

Anyway- this place is pretty cool. I don't think there's really anything else like it in AZ but I feel like this place is so ridiculously popular now (any place that can convince my brother to leave the couch says it all) that a second location has got to be in the works, right? 

Also, the food is pretty damn good! I was expecting it to be subpar just because you know how cool places like this don't really need good food. Just like a super model doesn't need to be smart, it doesn't matter. They've already got things going for them. But their food was super good! I had the nachos and they were tasty! Good for you, Topgolf, you're a smart super model or...eh whatever, you get what I mean. 

My only complaint is that the service in the restaurant/bar isn't that great. It's a lot of young servers, which I don't mind, but they need some more training. For example, when I inquired about my drink after everyone had already been served there's don't say \"Oh yeah, I forgot. It's been sitting on the bar this whole time, let me get it.\" Um...cool thanks, I'm sure it's nice and watered down, just how I like it. Haha. Or when we said we wanted to order some starters don't say \"Did you want to order them now?\" when we're staring at you. No, actually next week please. Thanks for clarifying. Come on! Ha but that's me being nit-picky and I'm coming from a place of love in that this place is too cool to be dragged down but silly servers. Then again, I am the dipshit that remarked \"Topgolf! I love that restaurant!\" lol so I guess the silly servers are in good company with a silly customer! Haha"}
{"text":"We had an absolute blast here. There were 6 of us and it was one of the highlights of our trip to Arizona! The men are avid golfers and enjoyed it. Us women are not frequent golfers and had just as much fun. Conceptually, this place has it all...personal bays for your group, different activities or competitions for the golfing part, and super yummy food. We had great service and everyone was very friendly. I thought the prices were really good! I really wish Michigan had this!!"}
{"text":"This is such a cool idea! The place is huge and has gigantic tv screens and bars, a pool, games to play while you wait, food, etc. They have a floor that's adults only.
You can't make reservations and when we first got there they told us it would be a 2 hour wait. We decided that we should maybe go eat and then come back but when we asked again they said we were next. Not sure how that worked out but it did!
We had around 12-13 people with us and I'm not sure what the biggest space is but we couldn't all fit in the booth we got so some of us had to stand or sit in the outer area. The game also only lets you put in 6 names at a time so we just ended up taking turns on anybody's name. It made it harder to keep score. 
I want to say that it's really hard if you've never swung a golf club before. I had 3 people teaching me how to stand and swing and it still felt super awkward. 

Overall though it's a nice place to hang out and the food isn't bad either."}
{"text":"My cousins invited me to go here to have a little fun before school starts next Monday. We arrived here around 11 PM but didn't actually get to play until around 12 ish. So be prepared to wait about an hour or two, but it didn't seem like it took too long because the venue was really welcoming. It was a nice place to just sit around, chill, catch up with others, and watch people golf. 

Our golfing area was on the first floor and farthest left, so we didn't really get much of a view as we were mostly facing away from the strip. 
It was my first time playing golf and I sucked at it, but it didn't even matter! It was fun anyways. Even my little nieces and nephews had a great time playing golf (they're under 10 years). So this is definitely the place for any age with experience or no experience.  

The place gives a relaxing/chill vibe, and the golfing range looked pretty. The service here was great, they were always attending to us and refilling beer/ providing water. The food was good, a little small on the portions and kinda pricey, but it's the quality you're paying for. 

Golfing isn't really my forte, but if I were invited to come here again I wouldn't say no!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my husband and another couple. The process of getting our $5 golf cards was easy and fairly quick for a Friday late afternoon. We requested a bay on a higher level and only had to wait about 10 min. Love that they give military/veteran discounts. The beer could have been colder . We ordered the chicken and waffles , it looks small bit was pretty filling."}
{"text":"Always love visiting this place in Las Vegas. The food is cheaper than the hotels (great food), the ambiance is awesome, golf is fun. Great family environment!!!!"}
{"text":"So our night started off pretty unfortunate. We got quoted 2 hours to golf so we played corn hole and ordered drinks and food while we waited. Our golf bay was ready before our food so we asked to talk to management to see what the issue was. Gregory showed up and catered to our every need. We felt that he cared about us and did everything in his power to turn around our experience which we appreciated so gratefully. The only reason we stayed was because of him and we ended up having a phenomenal night because of him! Thanks Gregory!"}
{"text":"It's always a fun place to hangout with friends and have great time. Overall fantastic but took one star because of the amenities that they can maintain little better like the billiards for instance."}
{"text":"Place is amazing. People call it bowling for golf I'd say that is an accurate representation. They have everything food, drinks, a full bar while you wait for your tee box. The range itself is all digital it tracks your shots down to the exact yardage. It's sort of like Dave N Busters in terms of playing as you insert your card and it tracks your play as you pay by the hour. Definetely a great date or group spot. It is expensive but I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"Our waitress (unfortunately I don't remember her name -- she was a really pretty Caucasian blonde Women with a really nice body LOL) was really sweet and attentive. We missed one of our plate and she brought it up to us for free at the end which was really sweet of her she didn't have to. She ensure that we had a really good time and explained really well how the process worked since it was her first time. This was so much fun me and my friends definitely enjoyed it and I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Great hangout spot! Or a date. I actually invited some of my friends to come here on my birthday once.
I love the concept of top golf, it's a fun twist for people who don't know how to golf, and you can play against your friends! It is pretty pricey though. I think it costed me like 40$ to play. And the food is pricey as well. Whatever though, I didn't mind, I searched up the price beforehand so I knew what I was getting into. I believe you can be a monthly member too, I don't live anywhere close to this area so I didn't buy it. 

The staff was really helpful because we came with a large group on a Saturday night and it was packed! The staff was really helpful in finding us two booths that were right next to each other because we didn't want to separate the big group. Finally they were able to work it out and our whole group was able to sit together! 

I had a wonderful experience at top golf with all my friends, it's really fun even if you don't know how to golf."}
{"text":"Service really downhill. After two most recent visits won't be coming back. I have been visiting Top Golf since it opened, it's where I take out of town guests to. I've never had a bad experience at the Scottsdale location. I've been to Gilbert 3 times in the past 6 months and it's insulting. Let's start with walking in the door. A pseudo security guard instructs you that each person needs to have a membership card. Since when? I've gone to Top Golf in Scottsdale with out of town guests, and we've used our existing membership cards. Then you sign up for the bay list (expected wait), then head to bar to order food/drinks. The bar/wait staff is usually good. The disconnect is the front desk/concierge staff. They text you when your bay is ready - maybe 45 minutes on a weekend night. Then they make you stand there another 20 minutes as they try to find someone to take you to the bay- meanwhile your food is getting cold. Also, don't even think about trying to coordinate the wait staff bringing your food/drinks to your bay because the front desk won't give you your bay number to give to the waiter. okay a few more go arounds to this nonsense- wait it gets better - you get the bay number, give it to the wait staff. The 'escort' to bring you to the bay escorts you to the elevator, opens the door, pushes a button and doesn't get in with you. No, you and your guests are looking at each other like WTF? Then you get out onthe third door and the escort is waiting for you at the end of a corridor. Then you get to your bay, and yes, your food and drink has beaten you to it. Oh, and the front desk staff doesnt know how to prioritize or greet/handle guests, at best it's a bunch of high schoolers who just want to be chatting with each other. Okay, back to the bay, now you start to golf - well, not all the holes were lighting up, we're pretty sure some holes were malfunctioning. And then the guests at the bay next to ours brought a dog to the bay next to us. Now, I won't even go down this rabbit hole of why a dog shouldn't be at a golf range, restaurant, and on top of it a third floor. So if you want to pay $45 for an hour of malfunctioning golf lights, another $25 minimum per person to eat, and then put up with the nonsense of the security guard, front desk staff, mystery elevator ride, then by all means come. One final note- again the restaurant/bar staff were all great. I suppose it's because they have to be adults to serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Speaking as an avid golfer I know this review will not apply to everybody. I understand now that Tiger Woods is no longer relevant, and the golf industry is hurting and needs places like this to attract more people because it appeals to a broad audience. I got my grandfather a $25 gift certificate and it did not even cover one hour worth of driving balls! Be prepared to pay an extra five dollars per person for some kind of one time membership. You cannot hit woods, irons only, there was an old lady at the door making sure you did not bring them in the door. For a newly constructed multimillion dollar facility that appeals to golfers this is unacceptable! I was expecting for $25 an hour for all of our shots yardage to be tracked this is not the case. You have to hit the ball in the target for it to tell you how far  you hit it. Lame! from what I saw $25 an hour was the cheapest rate that you could play that is during the day I think it almost doubles at night. Some of the golf balls were so beat up I'm sure they did not fly as far as they should have which is unacceptable for what you are paying! I can go to PGA superstore to hit golf balls there for as long as I want and it tracks the yardage on every shot hit for free! But I guess if you're going there as a social occasion with friends then it's not a bad place to hang out, did not try the food or drinks so I cannot comment on that. I don't think that I will be returning here to practice, considering you can buy a bucket of balls at your local driving range for five dollars and have lunch and a beer on top of that and he still won't spend as much money. If they changed a few of these things and actually catered to actual golfers when they came in, it would be a pretty cool place."}
{"text":"Went here for a work event where we had over 50 people, they were very accommodating, very friendly, and everywhere we needed them to be! Top golf is always s fun place to just have a great time at!"}
{"text":"Fun but kinda pricey at $45/hr to hit balls.  Great idea for something different to do. Drinks had no alcohol in them.  Bartender came around asking how they were & we told her about them & she didn't offer to correct them."}
{"text":"What an amazing place!  Golf, food, drinks, concerts and a pool.  Everything in one place.  We had an amazing time.  My 7 year old daughter who had ever golfed before now thinks she's a pro since the game is friendly to all!   We'll be back to play again soon!"}
{"text":"What a great time at an amazing venue!  Great views.  Great service and super fun game!"}
{"text":"Want to wait 5+ hours for over priced food, drinks and golf? THIS IS THE SPOT! Was here for a bachelor party and they did NOTHING to try to accomadte us. Worst service ever !!!!"}
{"text":"Fun fun fun!! Sort of pricey, but there were so many options! Our friends decided on the third level so it was a little more expensive.  The price per hour is for you renting a \"bay\". In the bay, you can have 6x people max. Also, if you are a first timer, they will charge you $5 to start a new membership with them.

Come at night because the golfing range will light up. So pretty but it's also more expensive at night than in the morning/afternoon. 

If you suck at golf, this will be a place to showcase your nonexistent skills. I definitely made a fool outta myself in front of the ppl next to us. They all seemed to know how to golf."}
{"text":"I had an ok time here but I think it's a little over rated. The food was overpriced and was mediocre at best. The drinks are expensive too. I think it's better to come here with a group of friends rather then a couple."}
{"text":"Went with a group of about 12 people. Let's just say that we ate and drank way more than we actually \"played\". LOL. Our bill was over $900! Our group definitely had a blast!"}
{"text":"This is everything I could want for a fun group outing!  They have it all! Drinks, food, large screen TVs everywhere for those into sports, a swimming pool and as long as you're not on the first floor you get some pretty spectacular views of the strip. I highly recommend choosing the third floor if you are over 21 (as it is 21 + only). The views are better and it has a more poppin vibe than the first floor. I have never been to the 2nd so I can't speak for that one but for me third floor is where it's at. The bays for the golf are rented by the hr, not by person or game, so if you have a group of friends and split the price of the Bay it is not too pricey at all. It is cheaper during the day and cheaper on certain days of the week. I have only been at night and I think I will only go at night simply because I love the views and the vibe but if frugality is what you were after, go Monday early afternoon. The employees are very attentive and do a great job of explaining how it works if it is your first time. You get a server too so you can order food and drinks and they bring it to your bay! So it's basically like being at a bar but much much better!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Murray Head - One Night in Bangkok)

Topgolf, Occidental setting
But Scottsdale does know what the city is getting
The creme de la cream of the golf world
In a game with everything but Tiger Woods

Time flies - doesn't seem a minute
Since the Arizona Casino spa is just across from it
All changed, don't you know that when you
Play at this level there's no ordinary venue
It's Tempe, or Chandler, or Gilbert
Or
Or this place!

One night at Topgolf and the world's your oyster
The bars are open but their drinks aren't free


Top Golf ... what is the rave about!?

Needless to say this place is pretty awesome.  I'm not much of a golfer but I can see the fun in coming here to wack the hell out of a golf balls while pounding down a few drinks.  

The place itself is huge; 3 floors of fun and a central bar inside.  The crowd and staff is lively and service seems on key. Though I'm sure they have seen and dealt with the worst; dealing with drunk golfers - ishh!  I came here for a birthday party and didn't seem like any of our orders missed a beat.  I ordered a beer and a some chicken tacos and had a taste of the Mushi, a burrito like appetizer stuffed with beans, rice, cilantro, cheese, and chicken.  It's shaped like a sushi thus I gather the name Mushi. My thought, well mushy indeed it was since it felt it was just a bunch of \"mushy\" ingredients stuffed together in a roll; I appreciate stepping outside the box, but please stay shut Pandora's Box!  My chicken tacos however were awesome! Crispy taco shell stuffed with smoked chicken and atop with a slaw.  Smoky it was while the shell and the slaw provided a textural crunch to every bite.  Perfect to go along with my beer.  It has some heat along, but the cabbage slaw helped calm it down.  Overall, a darn good bite for a fun golf place! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love Topgolf a lot to enjoy a nice night out with friends! Even though I'm the worst at golf, it's always an enjoyable time to hang out with friends, maybe enjoy a nice night outside, drink some alcohol, and hit some golf balls. The music is good and always lively! 

It's today's new \"bowling alley\" and I'm so glad they have one in Gilbert now! Can't wait to go to that one and see if it's the same thing as this scottsdale location. 

They have two bars, one large bar downstairs and one smaller bar upstairs where the booth/range things are! The downstairs bar is pretty cool to chill with friends while waiting for your table! The bar upstairs is not really needed once you actually get your booth cause the waiter/waitress can take care of your drinks from there!

The food is actually not bad here too! There are a lot of snacks and foods that are easily shareable with more than 6 people! It's gets kinda pricey though so be careful not to over-order at first! 

Overall I LOVE Topgolf, and I'll always end up here every so often!

Tips:
1) Go at night! It's wayyyy cooler, and you get to see the neon lights and stuff!
2) If you're going on Friday or Saturday at night, MAKE A RESERVATION ONLINE! It's so easy! Or else you'll have to wait for at least an hour
3) Get the cheese fries, it's probably the best snack food to get there
4) If you're celebrating a birthday or something, call in advance! They can help you set up your booth and stuff if you have balloons, cake, etc 
5) The bathrooms are clean here, go ahead and go poop! Hahaha this is always a problem for me cause I hate nasty bathrooms"}
{"text":"This is a great location for business meetings or a family / date night out. Great staff, solid service and food."}
{"text":"We rented out a bay and cabana for a work group and had a blast! I wish we had one in Seattle!  Even non golfers had a great time!

The games are super fun and the food is shockingly good especially the sushi and the shrimp appetizer.  Drinks were pricey but good.  

I definitely recommend reserving in advance if you have a group though they will charge a special service fee.  Also, it was a bit weird at the end when they recommended we separately tip the other staff e.g. bussers -- would prefer it all be included in the service charge/gratuity.

Also, they have a pool you can hang out in while waiting for your bay to be available!"}
{"text":"In general I think this was a genius concept. It combines the ability to practice a leisure sport without having to be good at it (this would definitely be me), while eating food, enjoying beverages and having a good time with friends. The food is no 5 star restaurant, but it's not bad! Recommend the giant pretzel charcuterie.  
There can be a wait here because it has been so popular, especially on a nice weekend day.  Don't let chilly weather keep you away either - every slot has a heater that you can set to your liking! Kept me warm enough on a 45-50 degree evening that I didn't need to wear my coat."}
{"text":"We had a Hyundai media dinner for media and tuners during Sema, 2017. The venue is well displayed, with good lighting, comfortable seating, and good array of clubs to use for enjoyment. They had set up a bbq style buffet, and it was surprisingly good!!! The kilbasa, pulled pork, salads, even desserts were amazing!  Wow. 

The servers were very very sweet & attentive and were very professional & detailed in their help. We were greeted right away by someone when we walked through, and were shown where our party was without any hassle. Overall, very very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Took my husband there for Father's Day.  We had more fun!  We had five people in a bay and ordered appetizers to eat while we played.  The food was very good - we had the wings (three favors), nachos, queso dip and a donut holes.  The wings were excellent, the nachos were different - they weren't traditional but they were good.  The queso was very good - had a beer flavor which I liked.  Service was very good.  I would go again and my husband loved it"}
{"text":"I went to TopGolf yesterday for my boyfriend's birthday. We got there around 5:30. We had to get in line to get our one time membership card. After that we had to go to the concierge desk to set up our time to play. The wait was around an hour and 15 minutes. Parking was full but we lucked out and got one fairly close to the facility. The concept is really cool. The main thing that stood out to me is all the other activities people can do to entertain themselves while waiting. That made the wait time bearable. The actual game was so much fun!! $45/hour isn't too bad when you're splitting it with a group of friendz. I can't wait for the Gilbert location to open since it's right down the street from me!!"}
{"text":"Incredible concept that should attract the next generation of golfers and just plain fun for all.

Unfortunately they are so busy the food and beverage area is horrendous. Understaffed, took 20 minutes for a drink, another 10 minutes for my wife's drink that we ordered same time as mine. Onion dip could be great with seasoning, vinegar chips have no vinegar flavor. Flatbread was awsome.

Feel bad for the service staff being put in that situation"}
{"text":"The guy at the bar was a POS he was a total dick. he was white and pretty built.  he was scum of the earth. I asked for a jack and Coke not an attitude. probably the rudest bartender I've ever dealt with, and I'm used to dealing with sassy men. I thought bartenders are supposed to be social or at least somewhat nice to their customers. This guy looked like he hated his job.... actually he probably hates all of humanity too the way he was acting.  I wish I got his name.  Whatever at the end of the day I'm not the one wearing that plaid vest."}
{"text":"Great time great food... fun thing to do in Vegas even if you aren't a golfer.  I will be going to the one in Denver next !  Top Golf rocks !!!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place was awesome!!! Such a great idea! A little pricey, but you are in Vegas, what do you expect! Such a great experience. My only negative would have to be finding the exit door.  We got lost trying to find our way out."}
{"text":"Topgolf is definitely worth the experience whether you are a golfer or you have never been golfing a day in your life. I had never been to something quite like this place before, however I enjoyed it. It was very lively and very self explanatory. The staff was friendly as well as helpful. If you go to Topgolf though I wouldn't order the food unless your starving. The food was subpar. We got the bbq sliders,wing trio, salsa and chips ( which we got guacamole with and Queso) the queso was oily and the chips were the kind you receive at the movie theater. The wings on the other hand weren't bad just wasn't crazy about the sauces. Other than the food just being okay, we had a great time. Playing golf in it's self with your friends and family especially when some aren't the greatest was enjoyable. Next time I honestly just won't order the food next time and just get drinks."}
{"text":"I was there this last Saturday. We showed up from out of town and wanted to take some clients. There was a two and a half hour wait! We purchased the VIP pass and Georgi got us right to the front of the line-- she was very kind and accommodating. Food was good, service was great, and golf was addicting! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Ashley C!   You are such a wonderful representative of your company!  Thank you for making our Kentucky Derby experience so much fun!"}
{"text":"Wonderful environment, food is subpar. I am newly vegan but they had some options for me which I was surprised by (also the only reason I gave a star). 

Customer service at this place has been a billion times better the very first time I came here but I went last night and it was absolutely horrendous. I was excited to bring my girl here and have a good time because I us so much fun the first time and now I will never return here again. Nor will I recommend it to anyone else. 

We were completely ignored from the time we agreed to wait 2 hrs for a space at the initial entrance all the way through to the end when my waiter didn't realize that I had already been a member and she double charged me for a top golf card (even after I showed her My card) our food was cold and sloppy (unfortunately I had been waiting until we got there to eat so I was pretty hungry)  

Prior to getting our golf space, me and my girlfriend waited at (non-busy) bar for about 20 solid minutes, then we sat in front of the very large TVs in the seating and dining area for 45 mins until I was fed up and asked one of the workers how to get service here (like it was some code you needed to know in order to get service) once I asked, it then took and additional 30 minutes to be helped. 

Once we were finally waited on (because I literally stopped one of the waiters and ASKED if me and my girlfriend could eat) she said \"are you ready to order now?, because if you're not then give me about 10-15 minutes to come and see you guys\" 

Luckily we'd been waiting a long time so we had our orders ready (Thank God) once our orders came, we were called to our golf spot. 
So of course we had to have our food brought up to the third floor. That service alone was $75. I didn't mind paying out a good amount of money because it was date night and there is no monetary limit when I'm treating my woman but that (on top of the $121.00 for golfing for a total of about $200) was probably one of the wasteful ways to spend my money. 


10/13/16 

Since my last visit to Top Golf I must say their mistake was fully recovered by the staff with tremendous hospitality. Our experience was phenomenal this time and we fully enjoyed ourselves. And a special thanks to  their management team for responding to us with such humility and respect. Thank you!"}
{"text":"So awesome! lots of fun!!! Great fun, excellent active date spot, etc....Have fun!"}
{"text":"Madi and Ricardo were wonderful! I'm not
Sure how old these 2 are ??? But they are two of the best servers I have ever had ! They took care of our group and when we had a spill it was cleaned up without most of the group knowing.  They were efficient, kind, and fun.   The food was good and the golf was super fun!"}
{"text":"Been to topgolf a few times, came tonight for a birthday party. Great service from our server Dakota! He was very attentive which is awesome for such a large and busy place. Thanks for great service! The food was pretty good too, nachos were pretty different but tasty."}
{"text":"Great place to bring family and friends. There is plenty to do for all ages. I love coming here and working on my much help needed golf stroke. A little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Super fun! There's one in Denver near where I live but we enjoyed this massive complex on a recent trip to Las Vegas. There is much more to do here than just the golfing feature. 

The golfing is the main event though to be sure. Best to come at night as the field is lit and the targets glow in different colors. There are various games you can program into you own screen. 

For those who don't know your golf balls have some magical GPS chip or something and log where they land so there's no confusion as to who scored what. Really cool. The games are a blast and this is a fun place to come with friends."}
{"text":"This place is a really fun time, even for those not so fond of golf.  All the equipment is provided and there are multiple games offered through a touch screen at each bay.  The atmosphere is pretty laid back and no one is there to judge anyone's golfing ability.  They had a wonderful beer special when we went on a Friday night, but I am not certain if it occurs every Friday night.  This place is great for someone like me because it combines two things I really enjoy, socializing and golf.  I would give this place five stars, but the price to play during primetime hours is quite expensive (although you may be able to divide it up amongst a group) and it gets very crowded and the wait to get a hitting bay can be well over an hour."}
{"text":"What a great concept. Why don't they have one of these in San Diego? Or are we? Hopefully it happens because this place is so much fun. For the avid golfer or for someone trying to find something fun to do. Top Golf is the ticket. 
Three stories high with three levels and in each story level you can hit golf balls on a driving range with targets you can aim at through out. Full bar. Other games are there to play like corn hole, billiards, darts among others. They even have a swimming pool to use for the warmer days. For Vegas, that is perfect.
Worried that you didn't bring your clubs. No worries. They have a full set for men and women to use and at no charge. Lefty? No problem. They have left handed sets to use as well. You can however bring your own clubs. Which is also nice. What you pay for is your time in your hitting area. Buying time allows you to hit unlimited golf balls which dispense out of a machine one at a time.
So while you hit golf balls. You can eat and drink. Reminds me a lot like a bowling alley. Your just hitting golf balls instead of trying to hit bowling pins.
My wife who isn't a golf fan or even joined me hitting golf balls. She enjoyed drinking a cocktail, watching a big screen TV and it was cold outside but had an outdoor heater to keep her warm. While I hit golf ball after golf ball. Perfect.
Overall, a fun experience. I was able to practice a game I love while my wife was contently hanging out. Definitely a more relaxed atmosphere than your regular golfing range. A good way to bring in new players. Less intimidating as well as a cheap way to get introduced to the game of golf. I highly recommend coming and checking out Top Golf. An inexpensive time for family and friends. This place is a winner."}
{"text":"Seriously soooo much fun! This establishment is GORGEOUS. When you're looking out from your box it doesn't even look real. This is just a cool place to experience whether you're into golfing or not. Employees are friendly and having a great time themselves along with you. There's even a huge pool on the 2nd deck for hot days. Oversized TV screens with sports on, drinks, music is going. Amazing spot, a must visit!!"}
{"text":"Why in the world had I not heard of this place before?  What a great idea!
You walk right up and someone is there to greet you before you even get in the door.  We get directed inside and are explained the different options for fun.

We chose the one hour deal, with four $5 memberships.  We get going with our little competition and are having a blast.  There are different targets to accumulate points.  Very user friendly.  Plus, we get service from a \"waiter/waitress,\" for lack of a better word.  The choice of golf clubs wasn't the greatest, but it did the job.

We had a great time for less than 100 bucks split four ways.  Plus, it is just across the way from the casino.  Good time for all.  I am returning when back in the area and am bringing friends!"}
{"text":"Taylor is a 5 STAR employee / Team member. We, my 12 year old son and I, were in last night for some TopGolf fun. Understandably there were a bunch of large events on the schedule and the wait time was 3 hours.
We arrived at 5:50 and the bulk the large groups arrived at 7:00. Taylor worked with me and allowed us the option to play for an hour before they arrived. It was a perfect solution.
Taylor is a movie star beautiful with leading lady charisma. She will own Top Golf before too long, if that is what she wants to do. 
The entire staff is on point and very well trained. The food is great and the views are wonderful. With a group of friends or the wife and kids, Top Golf is a cant miss destination. This trip was perfect thanks to Taylor!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and register for the $5 lifetime membership beforehand.  Depending on what time you go, it may save you some waiting time.
https://myaccount.topgolf.com/choose_site
Select the \"Riverwalk\" location and fill out the information.  Type in $0 if you just want the $5 membership when you reach the page for additional add-ons.  When everything is completed, you will receive 2 emails.  One of which will have a code that they will scan to make your card.  

We went on a Saturday night and it took us 2 hours to get a bay.  They will text you so keep a close eye on your phone.  It would also be a good idea to carpool if you are going at a peak time...although I'm sure this will not be a problem once the novelty has worn off.  

Overall it was a fun experience but it would be nice if the entire process was more organized or at least better displayed to avoid confusion. The drinks were meh but I guess that's pretty typical of a sports bar.  Its a great place to go if you want a change from Old Town Scottsdale.  And, as I mentioned to my single girlfriend, its an awesome place to meet men!  ;)"}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the first time last night. Sat in the bar area.
Our server was Mo, she was professional, knowledgeable & attentive. Pleasant staff which also included two young men who delivered our food & bussed the surrounding tables. 
We started with the 24 count wings. Offered up to three flavors. Did the Asian Sesame, BBQ & Hot. These wings are quality size. Superb. Seem to have a light batter on them, generously sauced & cooked to perfection! Crispy & tasty. Our favorite was the Hot, Asian were really good too!
Tried the Mushi, Top Golfs signature dish & well known for this delight. It's like a burrito and sushi united into one! Really unique and a must have here!
Kids meal ( burger) comes with a ton of fries, well worth the $6. 
Recommend if you get a salad to try the Champagne Vinaigrette. 
The flatbread, highly suggest! Thin, savory dough shaped into a large rectangal with the classic toppings added. Cut into 8 slices of mouthwatering pieces.
Had the Pepperoni & Sausage, next time I plan to try the Prosciutto, Artichoke & Olive!
Fabulous Food, Stellar Service & A Fantastic Fun Atmosphere..
Not surprised that this place is always packed.
Note: the music was still louder than our liking...have seen other reviews with the same complaint. Please turn it down a notch!!"}
{"text":"Was typically busy on a Sunday night but we got checked in quickly and put on a waitlist. Went to the bar and had beverages and eats, got our booth earlier than expected then played for an hour or so. Always a great experience usually the more the merrier because is easier to divy up the tab."}
{"text":"So. Much. Fun. Doesn't matter if you're old young or in between, I believe this is safe, affordable fun for all ages. 

Went here for my dad's birthday, went with mom dad husband and myself. We arrived on a non holiday weekend, noon Saturday, and it was kinda busy, our wait was about half an hour, so we decided to eat first. After we ordered, don't remember how long that was, we got our text saying that our bay was ready and that we could also eat at the bay. Yay!

Went to the bay, our appetizers were there: macaroni egg rolls and wings. Eggrolls of Mac n cheese was such a neat idea and the green chili in it made it really good and not too heavy as you'd think fried mac n cheese would be! Wings were fine, nothing stellar. We also got burgers. Those were fine, got Mac daddy and sunrise. Mac daddy seemed a bit much as far as being heavy, or maybe I had had my fill of Mac n cheese..anyway, we concluded that when we come back we'd just order snacks / appetizers and not burgers. Might try other stuff? Tots were good!

Golfing! So fun. It's kinda like bowling where you take your turn and watch others take theirs, but unless one of your is a real golf guru, it's pretty funny to watch your group. Not as easy as it looks and I definitely have more respect for golfers now =p
Anyway, 4 people, 2 hours, 60$, not bad! Plus there's a lounge (I didn't go to) and food if you wanted to kill more time there. 

At least try it once! It's fun!"}
{"text":"Located on the backside of the MGM, TopGolf is the best! Truly enjoyed every second of the experience. Went on a Saturday night and wasn't able to get up on the higher bays (too long of a wait) but for sure its something you have to do in Vegas.

Even if you are not an avid golfer its a fun competitive game."}
{"text":"Congratulations on turning us away before we even got started. Pulled into valet parking and was told they were \"full\". No sign stating full and plenty of spot available. Then the valet guys wouldn't clear the lane so we had to back out of the valet to get out with no help. I guess TopGolf is doing so well they have no interest in good service or consideration."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised tonight.

My buddy has a Platinum membership and I will say that after seeing how Top Golf treated us as Platinum members and their guests, that is definitely the only way to go.

First they drove us in a limo up to the 3rd floor... at least they might as well had. They were extremely welcoming from the moment we walked in. I did lack direction when I first showed up. I was a newbie and the Top Golf veterans had already started. Luckily my buddy came and got me and showed me what to do.

We went to our place in the Platinum area and our server Ryan was rad. Super helpful. Management also made sure to stop by often to check on us and make sure we were doing well.

The food and drinks were brought out promptly and were delicious. They just have it all figured out.

The games were fun. I love to golf and I love hitting up the range but this was a whole new experience. Super fun. Not Star Wars role play fun but still... very entertaining.

I'll be recommending this place to everyone. Touché Top Golf."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and servers are awesome! Love it here! The view is divine! The top balcony with the bar is so neatly designed. Plenty of seating if  go on a busy Sunday brunch. You can sit and wait and have a drink At the bar. The drink menu is a variety of wines, beers, mixed drinks I was not disappointed. Being that top golf is outside maybe bring a light jacket or sweater depending on the Arizona weather. The food was pretty delicious and comes out pretty quickly. It mainly consist of the typical bar foods, sandwiches, burgers, salads. If you get to go At night the course lights up with a variety of colors. We went during the day and it was just as fun!"}
{"text":"We have been to top golf Vegas 4 times we love the venue and always have fun.  The menu seemed better than last time we came.  My only complaint is that when you call there phone # listed on website there is not a live person to ask questions.  We went on a weds. Night and was closed for private party. Then I tried to call to see if they would be open to public on Friday night and I never got a call back.   Finally I emailed the group sales and got an email back."}
{"text":"Ok so at first I was like ooooh this is SO nice!!! But the rude and ignorant employees that made me give this a 3 star. I feel like top golf definitely need to re- train some of their employees. CAUSE FIRST OF ALL when I went to the gift shop the guy was a bit rude and was basically on his phone the whole time and second of all it was my friend's birthday so we ordered her a cake AS A SURPRISE. So the server (not the host) brought it directly to her and my other friend was livid, LIKE IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE A SURPRISE AND THE LEAST THEY COULD HAVE DONE WAS PUT A CANDLE ON IT. Total facepalm. Other than that, this was very nice and a good concempt. A lot of group fun. If only some of their employees were trained better..."}
{"text":"The wait wasn't too bad, about 30 minutes.  Food was prompt, drinks were cold, no complaints other than beer is way too expensive :)"}
{"text":"Ok I will start with I am not a golfer however I did want to check this place out so I came here for a business function. Our meeting took place downstairs. It is a great networking environment. It is very relaxing. The couches are comfortable and the atmosphere is relaxing. I ordered the wedge salad with shrimp which was excellent!"}
{"text":"Fun concept but very expensive, if you just want to hit a bucket of balls is your thing go elsewhere. The place is run a lot like a bowling alley which it essentially is.  Fancy Scottsdale drinks, some decent beer options but too many Budweiser (Four Peaks) products.  Food is mostly appetizer driven and burgers and sandwiches.  Nice but like everything else a little on the pricey side.  The system is hard to understand and there aren't clear instructions when you arrive,"}
{"text":"Amazing! I'm not a golfer, but I ended up loving it. I went with my family who loves golf and we planned on staying an hour since I don't golf. Over 6 hours later and we left only because we had a far drive. This place has it all down right. The food is amazing. I didn't expect it to be so good. The brisket tacos and chorizo sliders are my favorite.  Good quality food and so many unique items. I highly recommend this place for people of all ages. My teens loved it. The bays are nice and roomy.  There was 7 of us and each bay can have up to 10 people. You must try it. We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Awesome - super fun place to go. Very clean, and very new everything. Staff is usually pretty friendly and helpful. Menu always has good food. Very pricey - bring a group to split up your hourly cost! Very fun."}
{"text":"Visited this place last Saturday night for a friend's birthday party. Parking is a problem. At the entrance the staff was informative and helpful to get us on the path to golfing. After paying for the $5 membership we were put in a three hour wait list. (Get your membership online ahead of time or you'll kill 30 mins waiting in line.

To kill some of the time we sat on the third level at the outdoor restaurant /bar area.  Service here was abysmal; but the food was impressive and unexpectedly delicious.  Our waiter admittedly told us tonight was his last shift when we called the manager on duty over.  My girlfriend ordered brisket nachos an hour and a half ago and they never showed up. The manager on duty was careless and asked me \"You know this is a popular time, right?\".  He did comp us the nachos but was very unprofessional and cold. We saw him visiting other unhappy tables around us, so this wasn't an isolated incident. 

The outdoor fans did have misters attached to them and were blowing when we initially sat down which made it bearable. Just before we ordered the misters were turned off and when asked why, the staff told us it was for \"safety reasons\".  Pro tip: Wear appropriate clothes for the warm atmosphere.

Three hours later our bay was ready. As soon as we got there the touchscreen control panel was broken.  We spend 30 minutes idle while the maintenance crew fixed it. It continued to be buggy throughout the night. 

When we finally got to swing the clubs it turned out to be a fun night especially after they comped us an hour. Overall, I'd return but it would be during off-peak hours."}
{"text":"Was not overly impressed on Saturday ...really like the concept and everything...but the security staff and the excessive wait times ruined all the good it had going for it...don't look at the security cross eyed...they are a bunch of overzealous egotists who will not hesitate to 86 you whether or not you have been drinking...and if you question them at all they call the cops...even cops told us they were in the wrong...but then we got threatened to be permanently 86d..they just were not worth the hassle...oh and by the way the Mgr was even to chicken to come out and chat with the cops at their request...also when checking in was told less the 2hrs wait....that turned into 3 in a hurry...would better with a reservation system ...prepaid or not...just like if you wanted to play a round of golf"}
{"text":"Wow! Topgolf is a great place to hang out with friends! Make sure you get here early so you can get a lane to golf! The first time I came to Topgolf was a few weeks ago on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm, and the wait to golf was around 4 hours. Although I didn't end up golfing the first time around, it was still fun because topgolf has an area for shuffleboard, bean bag toss, ping pong, and great places to just lounge! 

Learning from my mistake, my friends and I came again at 11am on a Saturday and the wait was only 1-2 hours. We only ended up waiting around an hour. The price was $60/hour, with $5 membership fee for first time top golf players.

Besides playing golf, we ordered some drinks and food to share. My friends and I ordered sweet potato fries, nachos, burgers with tator tots, sliders, and korean beef tacos.  The food was delicious, but on the slightly pricer side, $15-20 per order."}
{"text":"Came here for a holiday party so I can't tell if this was business as usual. The staff are friendly, food was good. Gameplay is interesting but I'm not a golfer so my input is only on the experience as a whole. Very nice facility, clean too!"}
{"text":"So much potential but totally lacking in execution! The experience starts with there being nowhere near enough parking so you either have to stalk people leaving for 20 minutes to snag a spot or pay for valet. When you get inside, the service at counters to sign up and in the bar is terribly slow. Also, they don't seem willing to help arrange groups play together even when there are booths open side by side. Oh well, at least it's overpriced!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. It's a trek to get to but they do have shuttle service near the lobby. Came here twice in 2 days and both times was a blast. They have different levels where you can golf. It's a driving range but they have targets and you can score points and play against each other. Each golf unit I guess I would call it comes with couches and tables where you can order food and drinks. 

I think the best value is the second floor. It has a great view but you don't have to pay the upgrade fee for the third and fourth floors.  The third floor has a pool but no one really uses it. They also have a TV screen at every station and large gigantic screens at the end of the driving range playing every sports game on ESPN. 

The computers are meant to be fast and there should not be a long lag. If there is waive your server down and they will fix it for you plus comp you some time. The best way to play is just have a person hit five balls at a time. That way you don't waste too much time as an hour goes by really fast. 

If it's your first time there you have to pay for a 5 dollar membership. It's a one time fee though. I highly recommend top golf as its a fun activity in a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yo! You MUST believe the hype. Top Golf is dope! I would highly recommend this experience to anyone and everyone, especially for groups of at least six. The best way to describe this place is a driving range - Vegas style! Neon lights, club music, drinks, the glitz, the glam, but all very masculine too!

Our party of 7 arrived at 11pm with an assumption it was going to be expensive, so our plan was to just tour the place in order to be able to say \"yeah, we've been there.\" To our delight, the price of $60 per hour was not that bad after-all (initially we thought it was $60 per person!). $60 divided by 7 of us on Level 2 - take our money now!

After checking in at the desk, our party was escorted to the bay by a staff member who ended up giving us an overview of the games available and terms to which we all agreed upon (like the net is not a hammock, but there for safety). He was thorough, funny, patient, and just all around awesome! We were ready to get our 1-hour game on. 

The line-up is limited to 6 players with a complete entry of your first & last name and email, so our 7th member just shared a few rounds from each of us (unfortunately his name could not be inputted). In total, each participant gets 20 rounds. Therefore, it was recommended each person took turns after hitting 5 balls to get through all 20 in an hour.

For all of you expert mini-golfers, this experience will make you consider moving your golfing skills to the range. Boy, did I feel like a bad ash! Hehe. After a few warm-ups with the driver, an improvement in my form, and a beer, I was able to connect and hit the sweet spot more than several times. What a natural high. So much fun!

After an hour of golf, we proceeded to give the rest of the place a tour. Levels 3 & 4 had an awesome view of the range, a 2-level swimming pool with a swim-up bar, super XL movie screen, plenty of hip lounge areas, and more fun activities like corn hole and a shuffleboard table.

If you're local, just show your resident ID for a 20% discount; or if you're military it's a 10% discount on the Top Golf fee. Sweet! Our party was able to take advantage of both discounts.

Whatever happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas?! Nah. This spot is too much fun to keep a secret. Tell all your friends and book your reservation now. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"When I tell y'all I had a BALL at Topgolf, that's an understatement!! We went on a Friday night for a friend's birthday gathering and our experience was EXCELLENT!! We had to wait in line but that's to be expected for such a new spot with an innovative concept. It's worth the wait! After reserving two bays for a group of  11 guests and there was a 45 minute wait. We went upstairs and ordered drinks while sitting in the patio area. There was a DJ playing pretty good music and the drinks were reasonably priced so it made the time go by faster than expected. We made plans to order a meal before playing but our bays became available and we decided to hold off. Our waiter, Jeffrey, was AWESOME!! He explained everything to us and helped us get set up. He took our orders and made EXCELLENT recommendations for food choices. I ordered the backyard wings with fries and they were SUPERB! I can't say that I haven't considered going back just so I could order those wings to go. I like my wings extra crispy and would recommended asking them to be cooked a little longer but they were so yummy! The golfing experience wasn't as frustrating as I'd imagined because I was actually hitting the ball and scoring some points! I would tell everyone to try TopGolf!!! It's worth the wait and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":".Topgolf is great fun, at top price. Your paying too dollar for everything you get so you expect the best. Parking is free in their lot, but seems limited if it gets busy. They have 3 levels and a private deck and pool. Since we were there at night the pools were closed. I didn't see a huge difference in the 3rd and private deck. Also they pushed the 3rd deck is only 21 and over. From what I saw there were definitely kids wandering around the 3rd and 4th floors. 

So we ordered a pitcher, which was expensive, after doing the math if we had just ordered beers we might have saved a couple of bucks. Then we ordered fries for 7 bucks. Which were the size of McDonald's medium fries, which was really small. We also got no plate so we mcguivered a way to dollop ketchup

The experience at topgolf is fun, hit as many balls as you want, they charge you on time not the balls hit. 

Overall it's something fun to do if you like to golf, think upscale driving range, beers, and a great time. 

The staff were great and very hospitable. They explained the game to us and the hostesses upstairs were really attentive."}
{"text":"Rating 2 stars after coming here 2 times before. This was my third time coming here and couldn't believe we waited to be seated in a booth on a Saturday night when 2 floors had more than half of their booths open!!! There is a crazy long wait and all these booths open with staff walking around everywhere!!! They told us we had to wait because they reserved some seating but we were paying customers... Willing to pay the price to have a good time! They told us the first two times coming that they didn't do reservations and that it was first come first serve. Well we are here now on a Saturday and it's dead at the booths and we are waiting. Not coming back!! And I'm a local and active duty military. No love..."}
{"text":"So much fun with a great group of friends and you've got to go on Sundays and try their Bloody Marys"}
{"text":"Despite the wait time and slow-ish service, this place is a lot of fun. Food is pretty decent and not overtly expensive. The wings were juicy and flavorful. Definitely rubbed or brined overnight. The GOAT sandwich was good. Service was slow in the beginning. We were upstairs in the outdoor seating area and waited about 20 minutes with no wait staff.  We eventually gave our order to the bartenders at the outdoor bar. Food came out quick after that. Splitting the bill wasn't a big deal which was good. 

We got there around 12:30 and was told the wait was 2.5 hours. There were 5 of us total so wr got drinks and food in thr meantime. They had giant bucket beerpong and other games scattered throughout the building, like foosball, pool tables, shuffleboard, etc... around the 2 hr mark i went to check up on our time and they said they could get us a bay. Service was great from there on forward. It was most of our first time playing the top golf games and it was a lot of fun. It wasnt expensive, time went by quick. Definitely a great way to spend a beautiful saturday."}
{"text":"This place is great. Lots of food and great place to eat. Typical golfing in a driving range. But overall it's fun. Dirties everywhere. It's Scottsdale so I wouldn't expect anything other then. Waitresses are great. Warm, friendly and accommodating. Drinks aren't too bad pricewise and food was reasonable too. $35 for a hat kept me from buying one. But they got to make the money somewhere."}
{"text":"I didn't realize it was opening week. Came here prime time, Saturday night at 730pm. Line was out the door and it was about 25 minutes, and it was just to get a membership card. The line died down a lot later, but I had to wait because I needed the membership card so I could go to concierge in order to put my name in for a bay. There's a hostess in front that answers your questions as you wait. At the time, it was an hour-1.5 hour wait, which was fine. We decided to hit up the restaurant while we wait. 

The server got our drink order and wanted to take our credit cards to open a tab but she was gone for about 15 min, and no credit cards and no drinks, evidently the computers went down, which is also fine. it happens, especially opening day. But because of the delay, when the drinks and food finally came, our bay was ready, which they let you know via text. So we told our server, which they will take the food and bring it to your bay. The idea is pretty good, but the execution needed work. In addition to our food being moved around, my friend ordered a steak sandwich well done, but it came with a stick that said well done but it was very very pink, like medium rare, so he sent it back, and it was made again and it was rarer than the first! So the manager came and apologized and remade the sandwich again, and it was finally well done, and they comped his meal. So, in my opinion, it's opening week, busy as heck, I understand it's probably like Hell's Kitchen inside, and the manager resolved the situation. So I couldn't give a full five stars on my review.

Entertainment wise - the place was great! After getting our bay, a hostess goes over the options, answers questions, and how to operate everything. There can be up to six people playing in a bay and no experience necessary. You just hit the ball and the closer to the target and further the target, the more points you score. I haven't been to a driving range in over 5 years, and after a few practice swings, you get the hang of it. It's just like bowling but it's golf! You have 20 balls to score higher than your friends. Afterwards, we played some pool, shuffleboard and xbox games. Great fun and I totally recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"went for husband's bday. reserved bay. everything great. end another party was lined up to take our place. they waited impatiently and were not ushered to wait elsewhere. instead of upping our time, we left. there were more bays available too. after trying to speak to someone about it, we left feeling like they could care less. this is a fun place and customer service is great with bartenders, hostesses, and waitstaff. just didn't reflect at all what we felt we received from management today."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to visit in Vegas. The service is amazing and the view is incredible."}
{"text":"Always a fun time here at top golf ..the only thing I do have to say negatively is there is always a long wait the few times we have gone.. But they do have a few things you can do while you wait.. You can either enjoy drinks at the bar or go down stairs to play pool or play wii.. But we always have fun while we are here and the food they offer aren't bad.."}
{"text":"Lots of fun for people of all ages. The food is good, and the prices are pretty decent. Will visit here every time our family is in town."}
{"text":"Seriously had a blast here.- nice get away with family in town.  Great apps and a nice bucket of beer price. Not bad in additions to some practice to my swing:) . Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Great rates and easy to get a bay in the morning.  Staff is efficient and friendly.  I really enjoy this place with my family."}
{"text":"Hard to grade on a first visit. Honestly I saw a third of what they have to offer. The golfing is fun. The service pretty swift and they even hauled out left handed clubs for us. The beer selection is good , wine could use some improvement but maybe it's just not the environment. I'd have to try the bar to know for sure. $5 membership not bad. Some $40 an hour for a golf bay lol expensive but that's golf right? Keeps the riff-raff out. I'd go again."}
{"text":"Spent 2 hours for party of 3 adults and 2 kids. Well worth the fun time spent here. Went at 3:45 perfect for daylight and the beginning of night time lights."}
{"text":"Always a great time here, whether you are a golfer or have never swung a club in your life! It's a very casual environment that is approachable for any skill set. Not to mention that there are also some great bar seats, lounge seating and even other activities to keep you busy if you don't want to get a hitting bay (can be pricey during peak hours, but don't forget to ask for the locals discount on bay rentals if you have a Vegas ID!). They have corn-hole setup right in front of the big screen in the atrium, they have cabanas and a small pool with cocktail servers on one of the upper levels, and gaming at the bars on each floor!

The food is also unexpectedly incredible! I am a big fam of the grilled edamame that has a nice citrus flavor to it and their sea bass sliders are one of my favorites that I order every visit! Not affordable enough to come here regularly but a great spot for a special celebration or get together with friends- having lots of people helps spread the bay rental cost out as well!"}
{"text":"We called ahead today Sunday 6/20 and they receptionist informed first come first served.  I asked if there was any way to make reservations and she said no.  I callled back and then I asked if there was way to make res they said yes...This place needs training...we showed up and waited for 15 min in car before valet took our car.  We get inside and the staff is missing. No one but few managers around and they informed us 30 staff members called out sick on Fathers day....Strike out Top Golf...we went bowling!!!"}
{"text":"This was my 5th visit to the Top Golf in Charlotte and each time the service is worse than the time before. I'll admit, yes, the concept is genius and me and my group always have a great time with the golfing portion of the day, however aside from the physical swinging of the golf club the rest of the experience is needing serious improvement. The service is among the worst I've experienced. On this particular visit, my group of 8 had to wait for a bay (completely understandable on a Saturday afternoon) so we decided to grab a late lunch at the bar and have some drinks. It took about 20 mins for a waitress to even approach our table and then another 25-30 mins for us to receive our drinks. We then had to chase down another waitress to place a food order, since ours was sitting at the bar completely disinterested in the needs of the customers. After about an hour of waiting, half the table received their food then the other half of the table received their orders about 30 minutes later. Within a two and half hour waiting period, our \"waitress\" came to our table to refill drinks/ check on our food/ check on the table as a whole about 2 times. Quite honestly, I was surprised by the lack of service. The wait staff seemed incredibly young and they all just crowded around the bar talking, right behind our table (literally bumping into our table several times because the staff was horsing around and being rowdy), for the entire 2 and a half hours. The service wasn't commendable once we were at our bay, but anything was an improvement from the disaster that was our dining/ drinking experience in their \"bar/restaurant\". While my group may be back to play golf, I can guarantee you we will not be returning to the bar/restaurant. Save your time and your money and eat before you go!"}
{"text":"Fun place to check out in Las Vegas, and not far from the Strip.  Go for the beautiful Strip views alone!!  

I have wanted to try Topgolf for a while now, and tried to go in KC one weekend only to find a 3 hour wait.  Figured it must be because it was a Holiday weekend evening, but I've come to find out that there must always be a wait time while at Topgolf.  5 of us went to the Vegas location on a weekday early afternoon.  First thing that stood out: FREE PARKING!!  I hope this continues, but we were prepared to paid since Topgolf is right next to MGM Hotel (and maybe owned by?!) and MGM now charges parking (BOOOO).  But there was a nice little parking lot with free parking.  I also noticed that they have shuttle service to and from MGM, so that was nice.  

Inside- WOW.  It's a great mix of party atmosphere, relaxation, food, and entertainment.  We learned there was an hour and a half wait, and since we had nothing else to do we figured we would wait it out.  We went in to their lounge area where they had huge screens showing several sporting events and news.  From the lounge there is a bar, and the tables and couches (lounge feel) had menus on them.  However, even after sitting there for an hour, we never had a waiter/waitress come up to us to order.  For awhile we didn't even see wait staff, but after a while we saw them at other tables.  Not sure if it was because we already had drinks from the bar, but it was odd that no one checked in on us.  I loved this area though because they had some games off to the side (such as bags) to keep people occupied. 

When your bay is ready, Topgolf texts you which is a nice features.  Payment isn't by person, but rather than bay, and up to 6 players can play at a given time.  Our bay was on the third level, which is more expensive, but still reasonable.  Wow, the view.  Can't say enough about it!  You can pay by the hour, and all money is collected at the end by a server who is assigned to your bay.  So if you decide to only do an hour but then are having so much fun you want to stay longer, you can. 

There are at least 10 different games you can choose from.  We went with the most popular one, which is basically hitting the ball wherever and hoping it gets you some points.  We then switched over to a rookie level game where it tells you which color of hole to hit at.  

We had a few problems with our bay. First, we would have balls that wouldn't be counted for points when clearly they went in to the hole.  I guess with all the balls being electronically equipped, we can't expect them to work all the time, so no biggie.  However, after the first game, somehow the computer lost one of our players and suddenly we had some guy we had never heard of playing on our screen.  It took several minutes to waive down our waitress to see how it could be fixed--she couldn't even fix it, so we just ended up playing with the name still there.  I had asked her to credit us 5 minutes since it had taken some of our time to try and fix this glitch, to which she agreed.  However, at the end, she told me she forgot to give us the extra time so instead subtracted our playing fee ($5 per person for a \"lifetime membership\") for a total of only $10--but this was still a happy result. 

Pros: View, a place where you can get food and drinks (draft beers run about $7-$9), huge screens on the range so you can watch games while hitting golf balls, and a fun atmosphere to do something different. 

Cons: Price is reasonable if you have 6 players--if it's only 2 people, it kind of sucks.  The glitch in the computer was annoying.

Definitely pay attention to what time you start.  I forgot to look, so had no idea if we truly got an hour or not.  Overall, fun hour to spend at a untypical golf range!"}
{"text":"Dude this place is aweeeeeesome. I've been here a few times already because friends/work/club industry always have comped golf here. I really like the system because it is very organized.

You pay per hour for golfing and it's organized on a screen, we've had 6-13 players each time, it's so fun! You just wave your club over the laser and the ball comes out, and you swing away. The points are then recorded and it shows you how far you have hit.

The food and drinks are great! I recommend the largest white sangria! It is enough for about 4-5 people to drink! It also comes in a cute souvineer cup that lights up with golf club straws! I have only had the chicken fingers which were 5/5, the wings 5/5, and the fish sliders (they sucked like 2/5) everything was priced perfectly and the service was great. Definitely my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Service is sooooo slow. 40 mins for a drink. 30 mins to get a check. Everything else is good. Just don't expect anything good from the service side."}
{"text":"4 gals had a few hours to kill between hotel check out and flight back to Reno.  Since we had golfers in the group we figured that Topgolf would be a great place to kill some time.  Unfortunately the golfers were not into hitting balls.   Bummer it looked like fun eventhough I'm the worst golfer in the world.  Each putting station had a box of clubs, an automatic golf ball dispenser with lounge seating.  The balls are shot into a large area with targets that light up at night.  

There was plenty of thing to do in the other areas:
Several bars.
Sofas in front of mega-sized TV showing nothing but golf. 
Tables for dinning.
Swimming pools.
Private meeting rooms.  

We opted to hangout on the sofas and watch golf.   I just got an iced tea but there was a full bar.  Snacks were ordered: buffalo shrimp -- tender shrimp with a spicy sauce was the group favorite.  2nd favorite was the onion dip with home-made chips (not enough chips).  The pork sliders missed the mark and were dry.  

I'd love to go back at night and hit some balls."}
{"text":"I have been here on a few different locations in each time I've had a blast golfing game is very fun and engaging and compared to the Scottsdale top golf I barely had to wait in line to play... The service was really good to the servers kept making sure our drinks were full and exact.  Besides the golf I like playing the adult size Jango and the adult size beer pong with buckets and a dodgeball"}
{"text":"Top Golf

Ever since I heard about this place I've wanted to check it out. What a great concept this is and loving the game as I do it was a must to stop here and a nice break from the casino environment. Prices were a bit high, $60 an hour but if there was a group of people the cost could be broken up.  The location was close to the strip, right behind the MGM and easy to get to. There was a swimming pool here and you could make sports bets too!

My first impression was how clean it was and enthusiastic the staff was. We got there midafternoon and it was pretty busy but what place isn't busy in Las Vegas on a Friday afternoon! There were 3 levels of bays where you could hit balls into a fairway with a view of the strip. Apparently at night everything is lit up with music blaring....sounds like so much fun I can't wait to come back and try it out.

We opted to hang out in the bar area where the Ryder Cup was airing on the largest TV and order appetizers. The spicy shrimp was really good as well as potato chips served with onion dip in small mason jars. Pulled pork sliders were also ordered but not too impressive."}
{"text":"Topgolf is a GREAT place to hang out at any given time... I'm not a golfer (at all) but I always have a great time at topgolf. The drinks are a bit expensive but what do you expect? The best part about topgolf is how amazing the food is!! Try the chicken and waffles, nachos, bring a crowd, enjoy a drink, and have lots of fun with your family and friends!! This place is much better than going out on a very busy Friday... But the wait here is just as long - it took 1 1/2 hours on a Friday and pretty much takes at least 30 minutes every time I come (no matter what time or day it is)!"}
{"text":"We came here for my husbands birthday on a Friday June 17 and it was one of the best experiences we have had! Never has it been bad, but they went above and beyond to make a great experience! 
I was worried because we couldn't make a reservation we had about 11 people in our party so we had to have 2 bays, so we went super early to put our name on a wait.. There wasn't one when we got there so we went and had a snack in the bar, nachos were great! I just kept checking in with the front and they kept me updated on what I needed to do to get our bays together! 
We got up in our bays at the time we expected with everyone together and our server Brian came right over introduced himself and got us all waters and other drinks started! 
As the night went on he took really good care of us and it did get a little warm and I noticed one of the fans wasn't spinning on our side of the bays so I had asked a lady named Michelle if there was anything we could do right away she called maintenance for us and they did the best they could for the fan to be in the middle of each bay and not just on one! She was super nice and made sure there wasn't anything else we needed! 
We absolutely love Top Golf, the people, the food, and the fun! :)"}
{"text":"I called the Las Vegas location, they told me there was no wait. When I arrived to the location no more than 30 minutes after calling they told me there was a 2 hour wait and they told me no one called to check in. They also said that if you call, you automatically get forwarded to the corporate headquarters and that they have no real idea how long the wait really is. After waiting 3 hours for a booth they told me I was not allowed to have any drinks because I was \"too intoxicated\". I am writing this review from my booth. The service was terrible. I waited 30+ minutes for food which was served cold. Every employee I have interacted with was incredibly rude and frankly disrespectful. I have been to several Top Golfs and this is by far the worst. I know being located in Las Vegas calls for extra precaution but the employees were TERRIBLE. I asked for the gentleman's name who refused me service and I was told 5 completely different aliases. I was also denied services for simple requests such as a glass of water or simple condiments. In general this was by far the worst Top Golf experience I have ever had and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time with my friends from out of town at Topgolf. We went to the upper level floor on a Wednesday at midday. The drinks were great, the service was out of this world, and the golfing was so much fun. It is a great mix of high-tech golf with a fun atmosphere. It definitely is very busy even for a Wednesday afternoon. But we were checked on consistently and just had a lot of fun with no glitches or hold-ups."}
{"text":"I always have a good time coming here. Came here yesterday for a friends birthday. Service was friendly and up beat. The venue is a lot bigger than you anticipate and it has a great view of the Linq and a few other casinos on the strip. If you're not into clubbing but still want to get out for a night, if definitely suggest giving this place a shot"}
{"text":"Man I got fuktup here tonight!
Veggie burger was great!
So were the many beers, double shots of Patron tequila and the Bloody Marys I had!
So much fun!
Def will return again!"}
{"text":"Just a disappointment. No self parking. Local Las Vegan arrived at 10am on a Sunday and waited 90 minutes for a golf bay. I tried to make a reservation ahead of time but didn't want to commit the $250 minimum in food/drink.  Waited and waited to valet. Waited to check in. Waited and waited for a golf bay. Ordered a Stella while I waited and they were out of Stella. Out of Sam Adams too.  So we ordered two Cokes and the bar tender left the bar.  Had to reorder from a different bartender. While waiting for our bay I asked why there were open bays.  Were they reserved?  Nope.  They just didn't have the staff to service the stations. So we left. Disappointed. 
This place operates like a nightclub w/ golf."}
{"text":"Very. Very. Bad management. Spent hundreds of dollars at this location to be treated poorly by a \"manager\". Definitely will not be coming back"}
{"text":"I love this place! The view makes for perfect pictures. The food here is excellent so plan on eating if you come. Now if my golf game could just improve..."}
{"text":"Waited 3.5 hours paying $6 a beer. Yea. Only to be told we'd have to wait another hour or more. All the while, larger parties came and went...Topgolfing away. Not sure what we did to piss that little punk B off behind the counter, but their whole seating system is F-Ed. Not to mention, ONE waitress trying to take care of the entire 3rd floor bar. 30 minutes to get a bucket of beer. Probably closer to 45. The whole place is a huge joke. If you're looking to drink $6 beers with some of the largest douche bags in the city, go put that name on the waiting list and enjoy the scenery. DO NOT go here."}
{"text":"Think driving range on steroids! This place is amazing and such a great time for all ages. Whether you're having a party with friends or a night out with the family, this place is great. The food is sneaky good, the atmosphere is excellent, staff is friendly, and that's before you even get into the golf. Whether you're a PGA pro or have never swung a club, you can have a great time here. They have multiple games and a ton of options for all skill levels. I took private lessons and highly recommend them. If in Charlotte, request Billy Belair, he's an insanely good golfer and even better instructor"}
{"text":"This was my first Topgolf experience and I will be returning! I am not a golfer but I love playing games and I love beer lol this is great for a family activity or a group of friends! We came on a Friday night and there was a mix of people - families, dates, groups of friends, etc. 

The guy who helped us at the front desk Paul was awesome and super helpful with setting us up since we'd never been before, and getting us into a bay area.

The lobby area is a little hectic with people waiting for bays... I didn't get a drink out here, but my friends did mention service was not as good in the lobby. But once you're in your area, your group has it's own space to sit/stand/hang out, and a server for drinks/food. Our server was helpful, checking back on us periodically! 

We had a group of 6 people which I think is a good number to have in the bay playing at one time we played the normal/classic game. We played for 2 hours which at prime time (later in the evening) is $45/hour (they have variable pricing based on the time of day), which is why it's great to have a larger group to split the costs. In addition to the price of the bay, each player has to get a \"membership card\" which is a one-time $5 fee. This will track all of your stats which is the best part of playing if you're competitive like me!"}
{"text":"I am in town for the weekend from Raleigh for Scarowinds. I wanted to have a beer and food afterwards and we do not have a TopGolf in Raleigh nor have ever been to one. I arrived at 1:20 am on 10/29 and they close at 2am. I didn't know how playing worked and thought maybe I could buy a small bucket of balls and enjoy myself for at least 30 minutes. 

When I arrived the greeters were very nice at the concierge/ reception counter and were very helping and directed me to the membership counter. A quick glance at the screen and I realized that this is not how TopGolf works and I don't have enough time to sign up and play. I then headed straight to the bar and took a seat. We were greeted fairly promptly. I asked for a food menu and the bartender told me that the kitchen was closed. I then asked what time does the kitchen close and he said 1:30. I then looked at my cell phone(world wide time clock) and it said it was 1:25am on the dot. He then called for backup to get someone else to tell us we couldn't eat basically. I was annoyed as I looked across the bar and saw people devouring their food that was delivered as I sat. Another bar tender then took over in assisting us and gave us menus and basically hovered over us and really putting on the pressure to order ASAP. We order the nachos and they were delicious but our bartender never asked us how was our meal, they never gave me side plates or napkins. Another individual who was taking out trash saw us eating and in concern asked if we needed napkins or anything else.

Basically, if you are going to advertise that you close at 2am then your employees should treat your customers like paying guest until 2am. Not like we are imposing on the servers or bartenders because all they are focused on is cleaning and closing everything down. Customer service completely was not their focus, which wasn't a good first impression at all."}
{"text":"Showed up with a bachelor group around 7 pm Saturday night, and after being told there was a 2 1/2 hour wait, ended up leaving. $50 a person, per hour? Could've played a real round with a cart for less than that."}
{"text":"My first time golfing ever and it happened to be here! I had the best first timer experience. 

I love that it's not too pricey or expensive. Really affordable. Hourly price varies.

The food here is really good.

Their alcohol beverages are tasty.

I would definitely recommend their watermelon margarita. Also their wings and cheese fries."}
{"text":"They dont come at four stars because the waitress was a spectator . She stood by and watched . As certain groups acted like fools and . Threw a club in my play area . Not cool!"}
{"text":"Once we got to actually play, things got better. The game is fun and we had better access to service. The start of the experience wasn't so great. At the inside bar where you wait for your game, we waited 10 minutes for a server and 20 minutes for our drinks, which finally came after 3 visits to ask for them and a manager swing by. In the end we had fun, just expect service inside to be subpar and much better outside."}
{"text":"Super fun atmosphere for families, groups of friends or parties! The waitstaff is very friendly and make it a great experience. We went on a Thursday night and it wasn't very crowded at all. We will definitely bring friends with us to split the cost of a bay next time but we still had fun just my husband and I :) it could be a cool couples date night spot!"}
{"text":"Great place to go if you are looking for a good time.  Because its so new there is sometimes a very long wait.  (I suggest not trying to go on a Friday or Saturday night).  The drinks are a little pricy so plan ahead.  Food is amazing.  I have nothing bad to say there.  Enjoy yourselves and come and hit a few balls.  You will be happy you did."}
{"text":"Its bowling style golf!!! Everyone gets 5 swings and rotates while the score is tracked by RFID tags in the ball on the screen! 

What a fun place to go with friends! It was a fun and exciting  atmosphere.  I was really nervous  to go, as I am a real beginner, but I ended up doing pretty good! You don't have to bring your clubs, they provide them -for free! 
Also, you rent the bay by the hour, not by the person, so after everyone has a top golf member card ($6), it's a pretty cheap evening. They also give military discounts!
The food and service was great! Interesting options. We opted for the Mexican sushi wraps- mushi - and it was awesome!  

We went early on a Saturday morning and there were still plenty of bays open, but lots of people crowding to get in. I cannot wait to come back at night and see it all lit up! And maybe enjoy some beers. 

Kid friendly! they have kid sized clubs or a \"club house\" with shuffle board and video games."}
{"text":"Play golf while u rock out to Live music. The place is filled with all these cozy nook's. It also has old golf carts that you can sit in and hang out or make out in. The bar or several bars are awesome. the place has several floors were you can pretty much find something fun and exciting to do on every level. We went here for an after party and it was the best time of our trip.  Total late night fun for adults"}
{"text":"We had so much fun at top golf. The kids loved it and I enjoyed swinging away. The place is pretty much a bowling alley for golf. Games, food and golf. This is our first time here but we will be coming back. Food tasted good and service is good."}
{"text":"This place is badass! The mini games make smacking some golf balls a lot more fun and competitive. Only downside is that it is expensive. Oh well, you gotta pay to play I guess."}
{"text":"I always have a great time here, but when we come to play  and see MANY open bays (12 just on main level ), but told it's 1hr 45 min wait, it was very disappointing. I don't get it, not worth waiting for especially after driving 35 min to get here. I understand if it was busy but it clearly had a lot of spaces.
Not sure I will make the drive for future. Bummed"}
{"text":"This time made the second time we have gone and the second time the server messed up out tickets.  We clearly stated at the beginning we wanted seperate tickets. She was writing it down on a little coaster, so there was not a reason it woould be messed up like it was.  I was charged for stuff I did not order.  Once we told exactly what went on each ticket and she \"fixed\" it. It still was not right.  I had an extra bloody mary on my ticket, but just paid for it anyway.  I still put a $10.00 tip on the receipt.  Go to two days later and there is the charge I signed taken out of my bank, but also another $15.00 charge taken out of my bank account.  Although the food was really good, when something like this happens it totally takes away from the experience you had!!  Now my family will never go back and I can guarantee I will tell everyone I talk with not to go as well."}
{"text":"I like it.  I like it a lot.  Came her with some friends, and had a great time.  Very fun environment and great concept.

What could use some improvement.  Service is slow. It was a slow process getting a players card.  There was only a few people in front of us when we got there and it took about 20 minutes to buy our $5 players card.  Then when we got to our station it took a while for us to get our drinks.  It did not seem overly busy and they seem to have plenty of staff so they could use some improvement here.  

Food was not great, but wasn't really expecting that much.  Just your typical bar food.  Overall, I enjoyed myself and will come back."}
{"text":"So first thing, definitely book your bay online and in advance in order to avoid a wait! We came on Sunday and since my husband booked online we only had to wait about 15 minutes. It was pretty cool because we waited at the bar and got drinks and then we received a text message to let us know what bay we needed to go to.

When we got to the bay, an employee set us up and gave us a quick tutorial. Be advised if it's your first time you will be charged a one time $5 membership fee in order to play. The best part of this experience was that the bays were heated including the seats! 

The food was also really good! The pizza had way too much oregano but the portions were big and the prices weren't bad at all! I think my favorite food that we ordered was the queso--so good!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this new spot in Charlotte, with the expectation that I would receive the same experience I received in Tampa. The wait time/crowd was to be expected for a Friday afternoon, but what wasn't expected was the following:
1. Cashier who took my payment entered the amount of cash I gave to her and neglected to give me the proper change.
2. Waited 15mins after receiving our bay to be greeted by a server
3. Once our food was received, there was hair in one of the wraps we ordered and debris in our water glass
4. We had to wait another 30mins for the crew to switch out before we were able to get any refills (mind you it is almost 100 degrees outside)

Maybe they need to hire more competent employees or maybe they haven't been able to adjust with the amount of business they are receiving. Hopefully it will get better."}
{"text":"I had such a great experience when I came for Mike Love's show.  I wish I could of got the names of the servers that took my order but the guy server looked Asian and was about 5'0\" in height , thin and was of a darker complexion and the girl looked Caucasian long red hair and was also about 5'0\" if you see this thank you so much for your attentiveness. I had ordered some French fries and I waited like 45 min and I thought maybe they were just really busy so I didn't mind  I was too excited to see Mike Love anyway so the girl comes up to me and asks if I ever got my fries and I said no and says she will go a check on them then 30 seconds later the guy comes up to me and asks if I got my fries and I said no so he went and checked on them and came right back with my order and apologized for the wait , he kept filling my water glass and talking about reggae music with me and the girl came back and told me the fries were on the House Who ever you are you guys rock ! And I'm not just saying cause I got free fries lol highly recommend this place !"}
{"text":"Great concept and really fun experience, but what we were super impressed with was the customer service.  The wait time for our bay was relatively quick for a Saturday afternoon and since it was our first time, everyone was very helpful in explaining how it all worked.  Apparently, something went awry in the kitchen after we ordered and there was a delay with our pitcher of beer and some of our food.  Our waitress was very nice and apologetic and even got her manager to comp the missing food as well as give us some extra playing time - even with no complaining on our part.  I know people complain about the food quality but it really wasn't that bad.  You'll have a great time with great service here!"}
{"text":"Yup. Gotta try it out. Too much fun even if you don't play golf. Bring your friends hang out have a drink. Prices very fair. Apps are excellent."}
{"text":"Definitely a fun thing to do in the area especially if you have kids. The wait is pretty ridiculous but you can make reservations. We came on a Saturday in the early evening with a party of 12. The first and second level are less expensive than the third level. The third level is for adults and require all participants to be over 21. We wanted to visit the first or second level given the price range and because we had underage individuals. We added our name to the wait-list and were given a 1-2 hour wait-time. Thankfully, they had another section on the second level that has cornhole, TVs, food and drinks, as well as plenty of comfy seating. We waited there for about 30 minutes and were then called for our reservations. I'm guessing most people don't like the wait-time and eventually bounce.

The actual experience was a lot of fun. The staff was great, super informative. The food was delicious. I got the Chicken, avocado, and jalapeno ranch flatbread for $14 which pretty damn good. Definitely, not spicy that's for sure. We also got the 7-layer dip and the inject-able donut holes both of which were fantastic but honestly how can you go wrong.  

I would recommend it but I would highly suggest looking at the prices and discounts. We used a military discount which made the price seem much more reasonable. I know they do offer a discount for Las Vegas residents as well. 

I mean I'd even go just to sit at the second level, order drinks and food, lounge on the comfy seating and watch the big screen."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service from management! Our machine wasn't working in the beginning and it took them a while to figure it out. They comped the one hour we paid for and let us stay and play as long as we wanted. We were there for 4 hours. We just paid for our food and drinks! Our server in our bay was attentive and friendly. The server near the bar on the first level (while we were waiting) sucked but that was just her an no reflection on the place. Everyone we came into contact was helpful and friendly. LOVE this concept, super fun place! We'll be back for sure! Most of the food we had was great and the place was very clean! Btw- the only reason it didn't get 5 stars from me was the tee was too short to use the wood. We asked and they only had one size.
Food we tried: Salumi flatbread, excellent. Pulled pork sliders, great. Steak pita, not good - too chewy and dry and flavor was a miss. Tator tots, great. Burger, great. Donut holes, okay but wouldn't get them again - not sweet enough."}
{"text":"We came for my wife's birthday. We're having a blast, and Brad (the manager on duty) has been awesome. Our server has been great too!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Top Golf and we are from Orange County.  We came on a busy Wednesday and it was the start of a huge rainstorm! At first our 3 girls ages 7, 8, and 10 were amused at the beautiful lightening! But then the lightening became the biggest rainstorm we had ever experienced! The rain was blowing on us, sand was getting into our eyes and food, and the girls became scared and wanted to leave asap! Michelle, the team shift leader, was so amazing with us and the girls! She credited our stay at Top Golf and invited us to come back the next night so we could have a better experience.  We came back the next night, she greeted us with a big smile and took care of us.  We had the absolute best time, the night was beautiful and we would definitely highly recommend anyone to come here for a fun and different golf experience. Thank you again Michelle for the fantastic customer service!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy spending family time here. They have good food & great service. You don't have to be good at golf to have a fun time."}
{"text":"We have been 3 times since Top Golf has opened. It has gotten me to love the sport and we have had a blast. The food is fantastic and the drinks are good too. All three times we have been we knew there would be a significant wait time so we planned ahead and decided to do dinner. We have yet to be disappointed. Even with a three hour wait at one point we ended up golfing until close. It is such a neat facility and they have done a great job building an experience. Our waiter, Sean Switzer has been great both times we have had him and always try to sit in his section if we see him at the bar. This place is a blast, I highly recommend it for a date night as long as you are prepared for the long wait! If you are looking for something quick this is not the place!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times to golf during the weekend's corporate events and birthday parties however this was the first time I've ever been for a game party on Sunday.

I came as a guest as my buddy had a bay reserved for the duration of the football game a.k.a. Washington Redskins-Cardinals game. This is a deal if you have a couple of people who don't have top golf carts or just coming for the first time and you want to bring them along as a guest. 

Given that we showed up at 11 AM we ordered some Mimosa's (a carafe) along with brunch items ranging from French toast & 3 burgers with fries & some tater tot's... did I say Mimosa's?

Food looks good but lacks that \"over the top\" or signature flavor to it. You can't get anything done differently to your food (add some garlic or mix something from another food item that you like and combine it. The cooks just don't deviate so it is what it is (so says the server)!. The only choice is how you want your burger cooked. 

We had a pretty good view inside to be able to look at the other games as they were going on but one of the downsides is that you don't get to really hear the sound of the football games while playing... you have to go inside the bar area for that. 

The group I was with for the most part was cool but not many were golfers so watching them hit the ball was comical. We all spent more time watching the game and talking. 

Lots of options for doing a game party but something to consider if your looking for something different from the norm (standard bar).  I think you can get it up to eight people but make sure the group you're doing it with is ready to have fun, spend some coin and know what to expect with the food. 3.5 but giving the benefit of this experience"}
{"text":"It was an okay experience. Liked that the balls has gps embedded. The venue itself was like a cleaner sleeker driving range with monitors. We got situated all the way across from the pool. Only saw a few people using it.  The costs can add up quick as this feels like they are nickel and diming. We stayed for an hour in the 3rd floor. $60 + $5 membership fee per player. Got 3 drinks. Total was roughly $100.  The bay allows for up to 6 players, so you can minimize cost that way, but that just means less golf time per player."}
{"text":"Perfect place for night time activities. They certainly know how to make golfing fun now. It is a huge and colorful course."}
{"text":"It's a good thing San Diego doesn't have a Topgolf because I'd spend every weekend there and spend a ton of money. 

There are three tiers that you can hit from. The top tier is the priciest so we opted for the middle tier. We did a 60min sesh and it was a great choice - not too short and not too long. There are 6-7 targets out on the driving range and you can play all sorts of games that require you to hit the targets. 

The golf clubs are Callaway XRs so you aren't using some beat up garbage brand. Of course you can bring your own too. They have men's, ladies, and lefty clubs available. 

The driving range is roughly 220 yards long, so if you are a crusher (like yours truly) you won't be able to see how your ball would have gone if not for the fence. But of course if you reach the net, you get a solid point score. My only complaint was the system seemed to lag at times, which sort of interrupts you when you're bombing shots at targets. 

You have a dedicated waitress that is always nearby to take your order and they offer plenty of drinks and food choices. Pricing isn't too shabby, but it's Vegas so don't expect anything cheap. 

I took my wife with me and despite not much of an interest in golf she had a blast swinging the ladies clubs they had and sipping her margarita. 

If you're in Vegas and you've never been to a Topgolf, don't hesitate to go. If you're on a bachelor party, it should be a no-brainer. GO."}
{"text":"I went here the other night on 7/14/17 with my work as a company outing, I was a little bit questionable about if I'd have a good time since I don't golf but it was so much fun! The venue is amazing very clean and cool on the bays! The staff was so so nice and very helpful and always checked if we need anything else I never not had a drink they were on top of it! The food was amazing we ordered all the platters and the drinks were super good even the mixed drinks you could definitely tell they put the right amount of alcohol. The golfing was fun even though I suck at it and was drunk it was so much fun lol. Not sure how much this place runs but our bill was at least 1300. So probably pricey but definitely worth every cent! I recommend this to everyone!"}
{"text":"Imagine bowling and darts combined with golf. They serve food in here and it's golf driving range combined.  The food was delicious and I have a lot of fun with my mates. Recommended for hanging out / shooting the crap"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so much.

The Good: it's a really great view of the strip and the driving range is unique.... for Vegas. They have a lot of TV's. These types of ranges are not a new concept and the hype isn't real. Wow, I can't even be nice when describing the good about it. 

The Bad: only 6 people can be listed as players- otherwise you have to double up. The parking sucks. It's a super small lot, with an overflow in MGM. Womp womp. The prices are pretty high- which I get, but it's definitely not something I'd be willing to shell out on the reg. We weren't even a big group, a party of 9, and the space they gave us was small. Not everyone was able to sit down. Most of us had to stand outside of the space, behind the couches. 


The Long Winded Version: 

Upon arriving, we were trying to figure out where our group was. After walking around a bit, I asked the women at the private events if there were any reservations for 8 PM for a birthday party. The woman assisting us was less than pleasant. She was actually pretty freaking rude. She was really no help at all, dismissing us for every single party that had checked in for 8/8:15. Sorry lady- I've never been to TopGolf before. Next time, I will walk around 3 giant floors to figure out what's going on instead of seeking any kind of help from an employee. 

When we got our stall on the driving range, I ordered a Bullitt Old Fashioned off of their signature drink menu and just asked for a little ice. I got a glass with alcohol and no garnishes. I had to send it back twice- the first time he brought it back without an orange or cherry. The second time with an orange and no cherry. The third time, he managed to come back with both. How do you not know how to make a drink on your suggested list of mixed drinks? It's not like it was anything extravagant or out of the ordinary... So wtf?

They have a decent selection of clubs. It's cool because there are multiple floors. There are a lot of bars and the waiters come to your table while you golf. Exiting the designated Top Golf parking lot sucks on a Friday night. 

I've seen the Vegas local foodie IG's posts about this place and it seemed awesome, but unfortunately, we didn't get that. I'm much more content going to a $10/100 ball driving range with a 6 pack and receiving basic, well executed customer service vs a fancy place where they can't get their ish together."}
{"text":"I love this place! I am not much of a golfer but this driving range has soooo much more to offer. It is a great place to go with friends and just have a great time. The energy is awesome and the view is wonderful.

This place is a definite to do in Vegas."}
{"text":"Visiting from Southern California and the atmosphere and service was phenomenon! Specifically our waitress Amanda B from Chicago she was on her A game. From getting our drink orders from 11 people to checking up on us. It was  a great experience outside of California where people are actually polite and down to earth.  She was fantastic and made everyone comfortable and beyond."}
{"text":"A very enjoyable twist on the driving range concept.   The various games you can select were fun for all skill levels.    The clubs that are provided are much higher quality than those you can borrow or rent at the typical driving range.     The food was excellent if a bit pricy, but it was higher end than you'd expect at a driving range... way more than the standard hot dog, hot pretzel and burger.    Definitely explore the extensive menu and try some items, you won't be disappointed.     Have your meal here  - No need to stop for lunch dinner on the way.   The coffee was good as well.    Servers were helpful and attentive.    So why not 5 stars?    It is a bit pricy to beat balls here, even at the least expensive times it $30 per hour... that seems about 25 percent higher than it should be even for Vegas....    all in all a fun time for everyone"}
{"text":"I took my husband here for his birthday. It's a huge place with a lot to explore. We went to just hit some balls and have a snack. It was nice you don't need to be a good golfer to have some fun. The attendant walked us through the process since it was our first time. The addition of competing with the targets is fun and the hour booked time went by fast. I probably could have done two hours. With just two of us we got through three games. I imagine with a larger group two hours would be a must.

With the local discount the golfing itself was pretty affordable but the food and drink prices were steep which was the main reason for me giving it only 3 stars. We will go back but maybe just golf, no food and just one or two beers."}
{"text":"OK so we were just there an hour ago. First of all after waiting an hour to get in we find that we have been overcharged. Another 15 minutes goes by and finally a girl takes all my credit card info and writes it on a receipt. Then I am informed I will get my money back in a week!! Next stop, the bay we have reserved. It has lost the reservation since it took so long downstairs. Attendant fixes problem and apologies for problems. The assure us they will correct problem and I will get my money back right away. They offer of free appetizers. Then the bill comes. Again, overcharged
 This place could be great. It is staffed by complete idiots. I will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My friends and I opted do something other than the ordinary day club and night club scene so we decided to visit Topgolf. We had a great time and would definitely come here again ! Love the atmosphere here, the music , and how it is overall a great place to check out and hang out. I am so glad Vegas has opened this place!  No need to dress up and you can come casual. The people in the front will not stop you for wearing a hat or tennis shoes or sandals. A variety of different golf clubs are available and they also had left handed golf clubs for me! Now why not the full 5 stars? The food was just alright and I wish Topgolf offered more food options."}
{"text":"It's a no for me bro. Went for my friends bday and sat ate the bar and was treated like shit. Bartenders seem to hate there job and once we got sat our server was so rude. All of our tabs were messed up due to the fact the the server refuse to give is an itemized copy. It was a disaster and I just won't be back. I was pre warned but I wanted to try it out for myself I should have listened to others."}
{"text":"Such a fun and friendly place. I am not a golfer in anyway shape or form I had a blast! Great food and drinks! Definitely a good time! You kind of have to go in a bigger group to make it cost effective though. Regardless, great fun atmosphere and fun golfing games to play! I would definitely revisit!"}
{"text":"We are no strangers to Topgolf. We regularly bring our friends, from near and far, here for a good time. The great thing is you don't have to be good at golf to have a good time! (The full bar helps too). A big shout-out to the team leader, Michelle Padula, for always being SO helpful and fun to be around! I always ask if she's in because I know we're in good hands when shes around."}
{"text":"I had heard about top golf and was ecstatic when I was in Phoenix to find one literally within a mile of the casino where I was staying.  This place is a such a cool concept and I wish there was one closer to me back home.  It's almost like a sheek bowling alley type feel, but outdoors with a fancy driving range with large targets.  They have heat lamps and comfy seating and casual bar type food and lots of drink options.  You can set up different competitions and the clubs are provided and score is kept digitally and shows up on a screen above.  The only major drawback is the place is a bit pricy.  At the end of the day it's a driving range and you are rotating turns and will probably spend $50-75 if you get a couple drinks and food and play 2 hours like we did.  Still the night was very enjoyable, and I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I tried to go to Topgolf last Saturday, and walked out when I found out my group would have to wait 3+ hours to get a bay. We returned this morning at 11, and got assigned to bay 204. This was my first time at Topgolf, and I was pleasantly surprised at how relaxed and fun it was! The lobby felt claustrophobic (it's small and it seems like there are about 300 people in there at all times), but our bay and the surrounding areas were not crowded at all. We ordered beer and food, and the food was very mediocre. It tasted like bowling alley/bar food. Nothing special. At least the prices weren't egregious.

As a non-golfer, I thought Topgolf was really fun and a great activity to do with a group of friends. The hourly fee seems steep for a single person or a couple, but splitting it between 6 people made it very affordable! I would recommend eating beforehand or after and just getting drinks while playing, since the food was very \"bleh.\" Overall, I had a very fun time and am excited to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm not golfer but this place is amazing.  They have a great driving range, great view and plenty of drinks flowing.  This place is basically a party with a driving range."}
{"text":"I went here completely skeptical. I know what put put is.. and I do not accept golf. The onyl reason I went was because out friend hosted his birthday here.
Needless to say.. IM HOOKED. 

This placce was a lot of fun, it made golf entertaining for everyone and it has a nice lively feel. Modern music, lights, good food and drinks. Great atmosphere. Love it!"}
{"text":"ONLY WORTH GOING ONCE! Management take note!  

I went to school for Hotel and Restaurant Management. There is a ton of things that need to be fixed. I was very disappointed. 

I would rate this two different categories. 
First, the service was awful! This company needs to have more employees in the restaurant area. We waited 30 to find an area \"tables\" where they serve you. If you are not in this area forget about getting a drink or food. Then we waited about 20 more minutes to place our orders. OUR FOOD CAME BEFORE OUR DRIKS, huge fail! We sent my friends order back two times. They need to have more than two computers to place orders. Have you though about servers having iPads to place the orders from? All employees who serve and or run food orders need to know the menu. Our food runner did not know what ingredients were in what my friend ordered.  They need to have cocktail takers who walk the whole area of the restaurant. We had several food runners ask us, Did you order...?  How are your orders printed out? No table numbers to what is ordered? They need to go back to training their service staff stat! 

Second category, food/atmosphere. 

The food and atmosphere is great. The tacos were to die for!! Way to go to the chef!
Once you get to your bay the service is good. 

I would go once to experience this. Not eager to go again. You would think they have various locations that they would have things down by now!"}
{"text":"Awesome fun.   The whole family had a great time.    Great experience,  even for non golfers."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! Even if you stink at golf or have never golfed a day in your life you'll have a great time. The food is delicious everything we tried was yummy. We ordered the golf bag sangria and ginger drinks both were refreshing and huge. Our waitress was a sweetheart, she was friendly, patient and gave great recommendations. We went early on Saturday morning and the wait was over an hour. The great thing about Topgolf is that there are plenty of places to wait until your bay is ready. Do yourself a favor and don't go with more than 6 people. Waiting for bays right next to each other must take forever.   The pools are really nice. From what I could tell they are just open for anyone to hang out in. 

Tip- If you are staying on the strip you can walk to Top Golf through the MGM. We learned this the hard way. :-("}
{"text":"I came here for a work team building event and we had a great time! Not the sportiest group but everyone enjoyed themselves. The staff was amazing and made sure we had everything we needed and explained how to play a game that would be good for everyone. The food was also really good and reasonably priced. We went the the outdoor bar on the third floor after and it was a good place to have a drink on a nice day! Plus ours came in a cool golf cup with a golf straw! Top Golf is a fun place for everyone, whether you're great at golf or have never swung a club. I'd definitely go back with my friends!"}
{"text":"If you've ever driven by this super dope TopGolf location I sincerely apologize about your car windshield.  I don't even know where that wicked slice came from.  Usually I'm crushing them straight down the fairway.  Maybe the nets should be like 100ft higher.  If it makes you feel any better I got second place.  

Honestly, one of the best times I've had swinging the sticks.  The service was fantastic and they even put up with our drunken hooliganism.  Let us not forget that view by the way.  Even if the bright lights of Vegas aren't your thing they'll at least have the game on for you and plenty of food and alcohol to distract you."}
{"text":"I don't know that alot of folks are aware that they have a pool area with cabanas that can be rented that offer a nice view of the golf bays, but I'm glad that I researched online and found out.  The cabana reservation we had, for a group of 10, only cost a $250 spend minimum on food and beverage, which we were able to meet that very easily.  The pool itself it about 3\"6 deep throughout, so don't worry if you can swim, you can walk around with no problem.  The wait staff were very friendly and accommodating, we ordered a bunch of different foods and everything was great: Chicken Nachos, Steak Nachos, Steak on a Stick, BBQ Wings, Hot Wings, and more.  My drink of choice was the Patron Margarita-short and it was very nice on the tequila to filler ratio.  We didn't play the golf bays on this visit, but my friends and I agreed we would definitely visit here again."}
{"text":"Dear Top Golf,

Get it together. I've been to your glorified range 5 times since you've opened and every time I go I get untrained employees and terrible tasting drinks. The bay's aren't even climate controlled so why I keep coming here (as opposed to my usual Taylormade) is beyond me. For one reason or another I end up here with friends and every time I walk out I always tell myself it wasn't worth it. 

This last time was the kicker though. I went in to reserve not one, BUT TWO birthday parties and was very specific about the time at date of the first when I walked up to the counter (Wed 10pm).The guy said for the amount of people I had at the time and date of the party the owners bay would be a 550 FBM plus the hourly 90 per hour. Perfect let's book! I said that's sounds great can I take a quick peak and if it's all good I'll book it now. From the time I walked upstairs to the time I walked back downstairs the second man there proceeds to quote me 1250 FBM!! When the first guy comes back I repeat to both of them what I was told and the first guy then says that I he misspoke about the price it was actually 650 and that I misunderstood him and he was actually just mentioning that the was the lowest they would ever go for that bay, but that price didn't apply to my day and time. Huh? This guy just totally lied to my face, because why? Because this guy was his boss or something? When I called him out and asked him why he would quote someone the 'lowest they would ever go on that bay' when I was VERY clear as to the date and time from the get go he began to get confrontational with me. Mind you I was being very professional the entire time. He pulled the book out he showed me earlier and then begins to tell me that the 650 price was for a REGULAR BAY and points to the number. HUUUUH!! NOW ITS A REGULAR BAY. The funny part was that right after that I pointed to the header on that price on his sheet and it said 'Owners Box'. I want to mention that this whole time the man who I believed was his supervisor was sitting behind him nodding his head and rolling his eyes. What kind of place is this? I was floored. At this point I politely thanked them for their time and told them that my friends and I would have to find another venue.

I would like to mention at this point that the money was not the issue here. If they had quoted me the 1250 from the get go and I didn't feel like I was getting taken because perhaps their sales people are on commission than I would've booked not one, but both parties there. Not to mention my friends and I are exceptional tippers. Top Golf had an excellent reputation coming to Vegas and still many people are interested in coming and spending time here, not to mention many of my friends are avid golfers, so I thought it would be a good venue. But this is getting ridiculous. You are not a nightclub. We have those here. Very good ones. Please stop treating customers like idiots. Standardize your pricing and make it easier to understand so the people don't feel like they're being taken advantage of and train your staff. People pay good money to come here and enjoy themselves they don't need to get taken advantage of in the process. It's a pity because I had really been looking forward to your opening for quite sometime before you came to Vegas, but now I just roll my eyes when someone tells me they want to come here."}
{"text":"What fun Too Golf was! I got lucky coming in on a Friday night around 7:00 and having a wait of under 30 minutes. Say goodbye to the bowling alley. This is the new hangout. Here's what there is to know....
- You have to get a membership when you come. It is its own separate line. $5.00
- The drinks are Very tasty. I had a strawberry number. The food was better than average for an establishment like this. I got wings. I was disappointed that they served me only 3 flats in my order -_-
- You need not be a golfer to be here. It's not a serious environment. There are people who obviously play golf on a regular basis. They come in with their clubs. It's a judgment free zone.
- $45/hr after 5:00."}
{"text":"So this place is a nice place to hang out as an adult and getting away from the stress of Casinos and gambling. But be warn, is a bit pricey. I took my two boys with a nephew for an hour of play at 1pm on a Tuesday and spent about $200. $45 an hour plus $5 for first time membership= $50 per person.  Anyways, good luck and hope you found this useful."}
{"text":"I visited Top Golf Gilbert, AZ location on September 30th, 2017. We made a reservation event ahead of time for our friends bachelor party. There were 8 of us gents and we had a corner booth to the far left, facing the range, on the same level as the bar. Azia was our server that day and she was excellent. We had also received catered food for our event which included brisket, cowboy baked beans, macroni and cheese, sweet rolls, and salad with two dressings. Sodas and waters were also included in this package. The food was very good. Not over the top but it was just what a couple of guys at the range were looking for in a meal. We watched college football and spent 3 hours in our booth. Aside from the main event bill, Azia was able to give those of us who wanted to drink some adult beverages all separate tabs, which was very helpful. I had several different draft beers, their selection was a great mix of domestics, imports, and even featured some craft brews such as Four Peaks Kilt Lifter(the brewery is located there in Tempe which is where we went after Top Golf). I live in Las Vegas, NV and work on the Strip but I have yet to go to our Top Golf location. After my visit to Top Golf in Gilbert, Azia's fantastic service and participation with our group, I will definitely recommend this location to friends and family who habe not been yet."}
{"text":"Really good time! 5 people, 1.5 hours of golf, 2 buckets of beer, and one appetizer and the bill came out to ~$250. Not bad at all for a unique experience! And our waitress lady was friendly. We had a great time!"}
{"text":"So fun! My family (of 9) came here last weekend and we had the best time. 4 guys who don't golf, 3 girls who don't golf, and a 3 year old- we ALL had fun!! Don't be deterred if you have never golfed... its fun no matter what! The food is actually reasonably priced and they have fun drinks! The only food item we didn't love was the queso. We were here for 2.5 hours of golf and we spent around $400 total. Not a lot considering the dinner, drinks, and entertainment! So worth it! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Awful service. Awful wait. Awful prices. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. If the franchise as a whole operates so poorly, I can't imagine how it remains a viable business or why anyone would visit. The servers and bartenders spent more time standing and chatting than I did."}
{"text":"As a previous restaurant manager..I appreciate amazing service it's very hard now a days to get good 100% service..Our server *KAT*made our stay at TopGolf so amazing we all can't wait to go back I highly recommend her as a server.....now let's get to the food recommendations....for appetizers.cheese fries are a must order..wings are always amazing here.The nacho taste amazing but not big enough for a group but for a couple 2,its a good starter I just wish there was more they're small size but bomb a bigger guy or bigger girl would be disappointed but when they taste them they will love them lol....I ordered chicken waffles sandwich sooo good the chicken cooked to perfection not too crispy not too soft just right I would definitely order that again also ordered The Mac daddy burger which is a mac N cheese style burger if you love macNcheese you'll love this burger very good and filling. When you golf I recommend the second floor in the middle cause it's not to high not to low just right and the bar is right behind you too ....all around service from the moment you walk up everyone is very professional very helpfully if you need anything or have any questions anyone will help you NOT brush you off or be rude so I will definitely be back and recommend TopGolf to everyone I know this will be a weekly stop for me and my friends  cause of the amazing service and good food thank you TopGolf .If you see my other reviews it's very hard for me to give a 5 stars and i am very picky on food because I was a restaurant manager so I know how the kitchen and food and services and bar should be and you guys are top quality all around ...thank you server KAT ...because of you we will be back weekend and we will be requesting you as our server ever time if your there ....."}
{"text":"So much fun. You get your own bay with a great service. We were on the first level and I am sure the other levels were spectacular, but it was great for our family experience. It is not actually in the MGM, it is it's own facility with its own parking which would have been helpful to know."}
{"text":"Not only was this place dead, but my 3 cousins and I was denied buying a drink because my license was vertical. This problem is I'm 22. I have legally been of age to drink in all 50 states for the last 2 years but because it was vertical I was not able to get a drink. So my group and I left. Such a stupid rule"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on NYE and was beyond impressed! Purchased 2 joining bays that included open bar until midnight, champagne toast  and unlimited golfing for $99/pp, we had a group of 11. The service was impeccable! At one point we didn't even have to order another round and our server had already brought the drinks to our table. Food was excellent and the golfing was a lot of fun especially with the different games you can play. The best part of the night was the view of the strip. Being a local, going to the strip for NYE is a gamble. Top Golf was a perfect way to ring in the new year!"}
{"text":"It's a nice chill place. The music was eh....they were playing some mellow music, but it is a Sunday I guess. Gave it 4 stars because it is pricy and wasn't impress with the music. The music was good as we were walking in and then I don't know what they were playing after that."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential, until management steps in to help \"solve\" problems. If the app can \"sometimes take up to 24 hours to load money on the card\", you should probably state that IN THE APP! We preloaded our account through the app, then transferred it to our game for credit. Twenty minutes into the game, the screen froze and we had to call the manager, Casey, over. Instead of apologizing for the screen crashing, we were blamed for using the app and not going down to the person in the lobby to load money. Then he so graciously gave us 15 minutes free, but we had to buy 30 more minutes!?! We paid for an additional hour, had 40 minutes remaining, and now we have to pay AGAIN for those 40 minutes!?!? This place seems great until you start talking to the managers. Extremely disappointed in the way this place is run. Casey...just terrible..."}
{"text":"Love coming to Top Golf!  When we make a trip to Vegas, Top Golf is always on our list of things to do for a couple hours.  Great place to watch sports, hit some golf balls and have some great bar food!"}
{"text":"Eye-opening experience. Beautiful facility. Food was okay. Staff up front was not the most friendly. The games were fun but are not perfect. Not all shots register correctly. But it is fun nonetheless. I did not like that they do not take reservations. And when we arrived we were told that there were no bays available. After walking through on the way to the bathroom it appeared that MANY were available. I am not sure what their strategy is on booking bays (holding some for bigger groups or making smaller groups sit around and order drinks while waiting) but it smelled fishy."}
{"text":"I don't golf at all but my girlfriend wanted to come so I decided to try it out!  It was actually a lot of fun!  You play 20 ball games each....and unlimited games for the hours you choose to play.  We did an hour and got in about 3 1/2 20 round games!  There are different choices for games but we chose Top Golf.  You aim for targets and get points based on where you land!  Food and drinks were also amazing!  You get a bay (just like a bowling lane) and can order food and drinks right there!  Super fun and I recommend it whether you play golf or not!"}
{"text":"We live 35-40 minutes out and we called before we left. The person on the phone told us it would be an hour wait. We drove all the way here just to be told that it would actually be a 3-4 hour wait with 60 people on the waiting list. This is the third time this has happened to us and the fourth time this has happened to our friend. This is absolutely ridiculous terrible customer service. We asked the person at the desk why we were told 1 hour when it was actually 3-4 and she told us that the main desk doesn't even have a number that you can call, only the main office does. The main office does not even know the actual waiting times. We are mostly angry because the main office was just the corporate office that has no real connection to what is going on. Terrible, terrible customer service. I understand that we could have made reservations, but this was a last minute decision and we called in advance. Plus even if we did, we would have to pay a fee just to reserve a bay. And the fee doesn't goes towards the cost, it is purely a fee for reserving the actual bay and from what we were told at the desk it would have been a $50 reservation fee."}
{"text":"Great Sunday morning before celebrating Friendsgiving. The course is great for a Non-golfer like myself or experienced golfers like my friends. Food is excellent and my husband said the Bloody Mary is the best he has ever had."}
{"text":"This place really fun, but the staff is a hit or miss.

I have been here a few times and can make a fair review that there needs to be more staff and more training for the weekends.

The precious time I came we waited approx. 15 minutes for an attendant to help with the system. We also met our waiter and were served some time later but the orders were incomplete.

This was about three months ago and not much has changed.

We arrived on a Friday and were okay with waiting for a \"lane\" for about an hour. We enjoyed drinks and the ambiance and decided to order. When our lane was ready we asked the waiter when our food would be available and if we could transfer to the Bay Area downstairs. He kindly went to check.

No food order.

Instead of apologizing he said we must have orders from someone else. I explained that was false because I asked about a specific dish and he said it was spicy. He asked if that was okay. Instead of admitting his error he simply said, \"there is no food for you.\" Instead of offering a suggestion to fix the error we were left trying to figure it out. 

Going to the Bay was a bit better... Once we found the waiter. She was great and apologized for the error. But we still waited for dinner for another hour.  Poor waitress left to clean it up. 

I love the ambiance of this place, but please don't come here hungry. I am sorely disappointed in the service, especially when I was expecting and okay with spending some money on food and drinks."}
{"text":"What the hell is going on with Topgolf? First you cut the rubber tees off, then no woods or hybrids, now you can't hit your own irons on two levels? I can't believe that they didn't figure this out before. Huge disappointment! I used to love going to this place, but now it's more like putt putt entertainment. A good thing gone bad by just a few golfers. Use your microchip technology and eliminate the golfers who are launching over the net!"}
{"text":"Had a really good time here for a friends birthday, can be pretty pricey for 35$+per hour, but it's more of a bar type atmosphere and the food was okay, especially when the menu is only bar foods. The drinks were pretty good, and the atmosphere was amazing. Definitely recommend going here to see celebrities and to have a good time"}
{"text":"My only real complaint I have with top golf is I always feel rushed to play. I would like to see the experience more like a game of bowling...meaning that you pay for a full game, rather than the hour. When you are playing with 4 people, it's almost impossible to finish a traditional game...Especially if you plan to chat or drink something."}
{"text":"If I could choose one word to describe this place it would be chaos. Having lived in Atlanta and frequenting the locations there often, the Charlotte location still has a little of kinks to iron out. 

If you plan to go on a weekend evening, and don't want to reserve a bay, you're better off putting your name on the list and going to grab a sit down dinner somewhere else to cover your 3 hour wait. My girlfriend actually went back first thing Sunday morning and there was still an extended wait. Maybe the people that never got in Saturday night camped out ?

Bartenders were hardworking and efficient"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I had such high hopes for this establishment,  but it failed my expectations.   To begin,  the NFL food specials is only on Thursday nights?!?  So, football is only played on Thursday nights?  No!!  So, why deny football fans, football night specials?  My second issue is the service sucks!  We came in on Monday evening and the place wasn't that busy and it still took our waiter 20 minutes to take our drink order.  The food was okay, but not worth the price.  Overall,  I don't see myself returning until this place service and menu updates."}
{"text":"I am not sure how to rate this location.  The first part of the visit was not the best but we ended on a happier note.  I was visiting TopGolf for a friend's birthday.  We started off in the bar for brunch.  The food at TopGolf was amazing!  I had the Crab Cake Benedict with house potatoes.  Very delicious and full of flavor.  Thank you for the right amount of Hollandaise sauce.  Granted, we had 11 people in our group but the service was not great.  Most of the party had ordered at the same time with one latecomer.  The Bartender tried her best to come back and refill our drinks but the bar got busy.  We had a couple orders that had to be sent back and those orders took another 40 minutes to have corrected.  One of the orders only requested toast.  We tried to talk to the Manager about the lack of service and the missing orders, but he gave us attitude.  He didn't try to fix the situation and we had to wait for the missing food.  I recommend if you are going to have a bar with a restaurant, you need to have the staff to handle morning brunch.  The Bartenders cannot wait tables and handle the drink order rush.  

Once outside, we were treated to a wonderful golf experience.  You will have purchase a $5 dollar golf license and this never expires.  On the bay you can play by the hour : $25 per hour open until Noon, $35 per hour Noon-5 and $45 per hour 5:00 until close.  Once everyone has swiped their card into the computer, you can play.  We had the best server on the bay.  Our server constantly came by to make sure that we had drinks and he even helped us with some group photos.  I can't remember his name but he was awesome!

TopGolf is definitely an experience.  I am not a golfer but I would come back for another round.  I like the setup of the bays and the various golf clubs they have for men and women.    For being an outside venue, it was the best chilled place in a 100 degree weather.  If you have your own clubs, bring them.  But leave the drivers at home."}
{"text":"Awesome time and great food. Although I came here in October, I have been here during the summer and they have powerful fans to cool their guests down. The chips with queso is awesome as is all of their chicken wing varieties. The tater tots are great, too. Prices are decent and they have a nice bar inside that serves practically all popular alcoholic beverages. Staff is very friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"If you mixed golf, bowling, and darts together, you would have topgolf!  I went early on a Sunday morning with some friends, it didn't take long before the whole place was filled and packed. So get there early!  The food was good and so was the service. They even give you everything you need to play, so no need to bring your clubs. I also like how you don't have to be a good golfer to play or have fun here. There is so many games you can play, from rookie to advanced."}
{"text":"The golfing was great and the atmosphere was great and fun and we will definitely be back for that. This review is specifically for one of the staff members. I was with a group of 6 (3 guys and 3 girls) and we were all sitting at the bar waiting for a bay to become available. The 3 guys had their drink orders taken and delivered within about 5 minutes. Another 15 minutes passed and the other 3 of us girls still hadn't even placed our order. So we asked the guys in our party if they knew we were all together and the bartender heard us and ran over and started yelling at us saying we were rude and impatient and that they were busy and just because we are pretty girls doesn't mean the world should be handed to us... I was shocked and didn't even know what to say and all the other customers at the bar were staring and laughing. It was SO embarrassing. So then he's asks \"ok fine I'm here now, what do you want?\" My friend orders a Bloody Mary and her charge was about $8 and change. Then about 20 minutes later a new (and nicer) bartender came around and she ordered a second Bloody Mary and her charge was $6 and change, so we asked and he said that's the normal charge so why was she overcharged for the first one? It wasn't worth asking to save us from an argument and more embarrassment. Unfortunately we did not get his name but he is a bald man, looks maybe Philippino, but I can't be sure. If you see this guy when you're there, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"We had a work event at Top Golf today and we had an amazing time. The staff were friendly and extremely accommodating. The food was delicious and well prepared and the golfing was great fun. I would highly recommend this facility to everyone that I know. Melissa in event planning was amazing and she made our event go off without a hitch. We will definitely be coming back for future work events"}
{"text":"Topgolf blew all my expectations out of the water. It's a sight to behold, with 4 floors of gorgeousness. There's plenty of outdoor and indoor seating, multiple bars, cornhole, a pool, and private golf bays with a spectacular view of the Strip. To do Topgolf right, come with a group of friends to lessen the sting on your wallet. Six people can golf per bay, but spectators are welcome in the bay at no additional cost. It was $75 an hour for our bay on the third floor. We ended up staying for two hours. 

GOOD TO KNOW: 1) Smoking is only allowed on the 4th floor. 2) Reservations are wise - a friend in our group was wise enough to take care of this, otherwise the wait would have been a 2 hour wait on a Thursday evening for a golf bay on the third floor! 3) No self-parking is available. 4) There's an ATM on the first floor outside. 

My group started on the bar at the fourth floor for some grub. Our bartenders, Lindsay and another young woman whose name escapes me (she was a vegetarian with a colorful half-sleeve), were amazing! Lindsay was hilarious and took care of us. When my husband's meal came 15 minutes after mine, a manager comped us a round of beers. All in all pretty awesome customer service.

GRILLED PORTABELLA ($12): I switched out the vinegar chips for tater tots, which were awesome with the dipping sauce provided. The apples and arugula on the burger broke up the richness of the brie and the portabella mushroom. This burger was A-OK. I'll probably try the flatbread next time. 3/5

MUSHI ($14): My husband got this upon recommendation of our bartender. He loved it and presentation was on point. It's a burrito sliced up and presented like sushi. Super cool. 5/5 

I opted out of the actual golfing part, but hanging out in the bay watching everyone golf and knocking back some drinks was the highlight of my visit. Everyone in my group loved Topgolf. We cannot wait to come back!

{"text":"Wow!  I didn't know this place existed!  Stopped by on our trip to Vegas. If I had more time we would have certainly played for an hour or so with our friends.  Spent two days in Vegas Playing golf. A lot of my friends do not golf - this would be a way to inspire them. Apparently you can play games trying to hit the targets with your friends. Even if you don't golf - you can try to and enjoy the pool, beer and appetizers. Wish there was one in San Francisco - I'd throw a birthday party for 20 people for my hubby. This is right up his alley!  Very impressed!  Wish I thought of
This idea. Prices range $30 to $75 per
Hour to enjoy the venue and amenities."}
{"text":"We were visiting the area and found this Top Golf. We have a Top Golf back home and figured it would be a fun few hours to kill.

First thing we noticed is that the prices are DOUBLE what they are compared to back home (Tampa, FL). $60 an hour for a bay?? When we first pulled up we saw the parking lot was 1/4 full, so we assumed there wouldn't be a wait. Wrong. When I checked in with the girl at the counter she let us know there would be a 30-45 minute wait. She then asked what level we wanted. The 1-2 level was cheapest ($90 an hour for the 3-4 level). I told her the 1st level was fine. I was then informed the 1st level was closed for maintenance, so it wasn't available. I then said the 2nd level was fine.

First thing that was aggravating was that we were told it was a 30-45 minute wait, but there were at least 10 bays that were open on the 2nd floor. We went to the bar where there were 2 bartenders were working. We waited almost 10 minutes before we were served. Drinks are pricy ($12 for a Bloody Mary), but being in Vegas we assumed it would be a higher price than back home.

Be warned the bay's are not air conditioned. There was a nice breeze when we went so it was bearable. The waitress who serves us was a little snobbish when she first came to serve us. I asked  if they did pitchers of bloody Mary's (they serve such a thing back home) and I was greeted worth a scoff and an eye roll followed by \"Oh sweety.... We don't have such a thing\". First off I'm not your sweety. I also don't appreciate the scoff and eye roll. Totally unnecessary. It made everyone in my party stop ordering drinks all together due to the lack of professionalism. 

All in all I don't know if we we'd ever be back to this Top Golf next time we're in town. The prices, wait time, and lack of professionalism was enough to make us look for a driving range in the area where we can get a bucket of balls for $1"}
{"text":"Why the five stars- Angus. He chatted up our group and provided us with some pretty good recommendations on everything! Golfing tips, food (those sea bass sliders- amazing)! So delicious. 
Short falls: The tacos though, well those missed the mark. My mimosa was pure OJ (no, not that one) and warm. At 6pm they were out of mojitos- yes, out of. Go figure.
Angus provided our group with a wonderful experience and atmosphere.  Showed us around and informed us of other times and future 'happenings' at TopGolf.  This town is awash in the many stereotypes, one being all the outdoor golf courses (those have no relief from the sun).  Now LV has TopGolf! The group of us who enjoyed TopGolf are all locals (transplants) and we are in the making of gathering more friends and coming back with a larger group. Only because, Angus had a vast knowledge of the entire venue. Cerrin our waitress was attentive and quite the bubbly personality! Now, let me rate the attire of the staff- please change those shorts. Outdoor cooling misters would've appreciated, if they had some:)   Please make sure and locate Angus when you visit his TopGolf location (just think of the one who wears those velvet outfits from AC/DC)!"}
{"text":"Glorified driving range....

I gave this two stars only because I understand when people are in town you gotta take them out but YIKES this place is a RIP OFF. Food is good but then you see the bill and at night they charge you 50 to reserve or plan on waiting 2 hours NOT at the bar because it's packed and NOT downstairs playing pool or shuffleboard because that's also packed"}
{"text":"This is my third time at topgolf . During the cooler evenings in az they have heat lamps at every golf bay . Evenings are very busy so have patience . We have tried the food and it's been very good . Crowd is both after work groups and family's . They seem to control the idiot factor ( over serving , club throwing ) as much as possible . We will be back . Weekday mornings and afternoons are the perfect time for a less hectic visit ."}
{"text":"Usually this Top Golf is a great experience, however, today we waited 3 hours to get a bay; after being told it was an hour and a half to 2 hour wait. We were not offered any coupons or apologies for the inconvenience, and management was extremely rude and inconsiderate. I will not be returning here and will be telling others to take their business elsewhere."}
{"text":"My 8 year old son and I had a great time.  We are both rookies but it didn't matter. The service was great and the food was good. We will make this our regular outing."}
{"text":"Me and my friends went here and had a ton of fun. Great atmosphere, especially at night. I recommend this place for all skill levels."}
{"text":"Great fun for all types of people. Even if you have never golfed before you can still have a great time and are bound to make some eventually. All kinds of games for those that are talented in the sport and those like me who have very limited skills. 

We stayed until after the sunset and they light up the holes.  There is a great view of the mountains from the upper deck and the misters keep the temperature doable even in the summer. 

I came for a worth event and they had a nice assortment of foods. The staff are all very friendly and helpful.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I really want to write a 4-star review because this place was awesome, but we had a really strange experience that hindered our visit.  First off, the facility is beautiful, brand new and provides for a very unique activity in the heart of Vegas (wish we had one closer to home).  Pricey, but hey, what can you expect when in Vegas? We ordered a large sangria, and it was very tart (not in a good way) and very weak, but it did come in a cool little light up golf bag. 

Now onto the, eh... strange part... I left my husband at the bay with the attendant to get the game set up while I went to the restroom.  I came back shortly thereafter to my husband, the attendant and a very strange waitress.  She babbled something to me, grabbed my husbands arm to show me some glitter on it and walked away...weird. It wasn't until we got settled that I asked my husband what that was all about.  He said that she seemed out of it (not making any assumptions, but possibly drunk?), had come to take our order, saw our shopping bag from Lush on the table, STUCK HER HAND IN OUR BAG, touched my bath bomb (which was covered in glitter), then proceeded to wipe it on my husbands arm.   I'm not a genius, but I think anyone with a brain would realize how grossly inappropriate this is, especially to reach into a customers shopping bag and grab what was in it!  Needless to say, it didn't sit well with me, unfortunate considering this happened on the first day of my birthday vacation.  

Kicking myself for misplacing the receipt, which I saved on purpose to keep the waitresses name."}
{"text":"Interesting entertainment venue.. Pricey. Valet was disorganized...at best... and the reception area 'lost' our name in their system so a 15 minute wait time became an hour- they have some bugs to work out."}
{"text":"What a state of the art facility with awesome technology incorporated in their equipment. When I want a great relaxing day I hit up topgolf then go accroes to street to San Tan Salon and Spa located inside the Double Tree. Their massage therapist Jessica is superior within her craft!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were very excited to try out Topgolf and it did not disappoint. It was a unique experience and lots of fun even though it was just the two of us. It would be amazing if you had a larger group to go but still wonderful if there are a couple of you. It can get a bit pricey around the peak times but the food and alcohol are adequately priced so there's no complaints there. Although it doesn't help your golf game when you've wagered a bunch of money on football and have to watch your team get destroyed on the gigantic screens in the distance haha. We ordered the Jumbo Pretzel Board and the Asian Sesame Wings. I would have both again but I would for sure recommend the Jumbo Pretzel Board. Looking forward to the next Topgolf experience."}
{"text":"We arrived at Topgolf at 11 am on a rainy Saturday. The place was busy, and they were on an hour wait. There was plenty to do while we waited - pool, eating and drinking, walking around the place, and more. The hour passed quickly, and we were soon taken to our bay. We were checked in by a helpful employee who explained the concept, and quickly got to playing. Our group of 4 played for 1.5 hours (which was the right amount of time), and we had a great time.

Some things to know:
-Wear anything - flip flops, heels, sneakers, etc.
-Bring your own clubs or use theirs (for free)
-Great way to spend time as a group of friends, couple, or family (if a family go earlier in the day as this place becomes a party scene as it gets later in the day)
-You can eat and drink here - they have a variety of food though I've heard the food is just average
-They have clean restrooms
-Pricing is by the hour by the bay (up to 6 people per bay).
-Prices escalate as the day goes on - I believe $25 an hour per bay until the noon, then $35 from noon to 4pm, and then $45 the rest of the day"}
{"text":"I'm not even an avid golfer - or golfer at all. In fact, even put put frustrates me. However, I LOVED playing here. We had a very long wait to play, so we decided to eat while we waited. Surprisingly, the food was EXCELLENT. It took quite some time to get our food, but we were there during their busiest time - Saturday night. The food and drinks ARE pricey, but everything is delicious. Overall, great food, great fun, great time. Smaller children would have a TOUGH time waiting, but it's an excellent outing for young adults and up. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had an amazing time!  Great fun for all of our party.  Even with my lack of golf skills I still had an excellent time.  The food was terrific too!"}
{"text":"Lots of fun. From the employees in general to the atmosphere this place is completely perfect for a fun Saturday. We were visiting from Orange County (build one in the OC) and came here in a group on Valentines Day. We waited about 30 minutes and hung out in the bar prior. The drinks were good and well priced in my opinion. It can get a little pricey at night, when we went, but its all worth it in my opinion!"}
{"text":"What a fun experience this is! I arrived reasonable early about 10am, and I signed up for 30 minutes since it was my first visit and I wanted to see how it all worked. It was just myself and my wife, I was the only one hitting balls, while my wife used the the free wi-fi. Our hitting station have a 5 seat high top or I could have request a sofa seating about the same number, we have our own TV with the college football on and a screen for everyone to see the hitter scores and distances. I had a great time the 30 minute flew by, I will be back with friends for some friendly competition! The food & drink were reasonable prices but prices per hour do go up the later in the day you visit, but if you are splitting it 3-4 ways it's not bad, depending on how much beer you drink!"}
{"text":"Ahh Top Golf, you are an enigma to me.....some of my experience was an over the top 5 star review and some of it wasn't worth a 1 and probably more deservedly needs a call to the health department.
Many people have complained about the check-in....it's a little ludicrous, but a little research will save you time (Pro tip: get your membership ahead of time and reserve your bay early). 
The one BIG plus...for this place being such a madhouse, none of the employees were rude or pushy.
The game itself was great. Staff explained options and it was just fun. This the 5 star part. I'm not a golfer, but it's kind of like a high-end bowling alley...but golf. The food was good too.
Now the zero.....
Bathrooms!!! Top Golf needs more or they need to keep them monitored. It's just unacceptable to have the ladies room closed especially when you're on a 5-hour wait. The men's room was open but it such a sorry state the health department would have closed them down. I usually don't' advertise when I puke, but that great BBQ Grilled Cheese I had eaten an hour before came right up because of the nausea inducing men's room. 
Besides the checkin and the bathrooms this was a pretty fun night, but I would wait until the new factor wears off before returning."}
{"text":"Not a fan.  Contrived, with terrible rental clubs (of course with top golf brand) and low flight balls.  Had to buy a glove because of course they couldn't provide one.  They charge to become a member, charge for gloves, charge for the bay, charge for the food, charge for the drinks, charge for the air to breathe.  

Scoring system is a joke.  The targets are like drains so everything tunnels to them, especially the ugliest struck shots.  Only thing that was good was the service.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time over the weekend and had a BLAST. I wish they had these in CA. First of all, I am horrible. But it's such a relaxed atmosphere. Our server was so nice and attentive. We ordered drinks and chips and queso. The queso was amazing, salsa and quac not so much.  I had the mac and cheese burger which was huge and amazing. My boyfriend had wings and our friend got sliders which were great. I would definitely come back all the time if they were in CA."}
{"text":"Super fun place to go with the family. Food and cocktails were top notch. Felt like we were in Vegas except for the gambling. Just be prepared to pay for it all, pricey place. Still give it 5 stars because we had so much fun."}
{"text":"Always a great time. This place is for anyone that wants to chill with friends and hit (or try and hit) some golf balls and have some fun. Can get pretty loud, they always have music blaring. Causal/energetic ambiance. TVs for sports at every bay."}
{"text":"From a team event perspective this is one of the best options out there if you have a group of 12+ and can take over a couple of bays. Solid food, good craft beer selection and solid vibe."}
{"text":"This place looks amazing, great facilities...but that will never make up for the absolute worst service I have experienced in Arizona.  
We were told our wait for a golf spot was 30 minutes.  So we went to the bar to have a drink.  We sat at a dirty table that never got bussed for over an hour while we waited for our golf lane that was only supposed to be a 30 minute wait.  Not only that, but no one took our order for 20 minutes, then only served us one drink and we never saw them again.  It took us going to get a front desk staffer to find our waiter to close out our bar tab.  We were so frustrated that we ended up asking for a refund and leaving."}
{"text":"Topgolf was a great place to go to while in Vegas. It's got big tv screens, very nice swimming pools on two different floors with swim up bar, live music, food & a few bars on each floor. It's definitely a group outing place. Good for families with kids. I definitely would go back again! Wish they had a Topgolf in Los Angeles!! Awesome place for sure!"}
{"text":"Top golf is always a fun, laid back option for entertainment with friends or family. Top Golf is just a big range and you take turns hitting golf balls in the attempt to get your ball into large holes. Hitting the golf balls into farther holes gets you more points. You get a lane kind of like bowling and you get charged by the hour for the use of the lane and individual membership cards (which are a one-time $5 charge and can be used at any Top Golf). It was quite chilly in Vegas and my group was placed in the last lane. The last lane only had one overhead heater while the other lanes had 2 heaters to keep warm. So we were cold and uncomfortable in our lane. My friends and I ordered food and just relaxed and played our round. I ordered the pulled pork sliders which came with tater tots. I wasn't impressed by the food. I ate the tater tots and didn't really enjoy the pulled pork sliders. The bbq sauce used for the sliders was too sweet."}
{"text":"Order the breakfast sandwich (high ratings from my son).  

Busy place and we waited about 10min for a bay (which isn't bad at all).  Game room is pretty nice while waiting (for said bay). TV screens across the green are a nice touch.  Only difference here is their games don't have the 15th hole challenge (like in Denver)."}
{"text":"Great service, good food. Amazing staff who does not give you a hard time and just want you to have fun. This is the place to be from the young kids to the older crowd who want to enjoy a nice drink and have some fun. I come here every year when I'm on vacation and always leave with a smile"}
{"text":"Geno, Phillipa and Bailey are AMAZING! Such a great experience here! From walking up to Geno in MGM he was very personable and even said when we're back from Top Golf to come see him so he can recommend places for our Honeymoon. We then get into the Shuttle and Phillipa was nothing but AMAZING! She held a conversation with us the whole ride. Very sweet! I wish I met more people like her! Now Bailey our host on the first floor. She is super sweet too! Came up to us with a smile and has helped us the whole time. All three I think should get a raise!! They are all amazing! I will be back because of them!"}
{"text":"If you've been to other locations...you will be disappointed. Service is very subpar. Pay twice as much for less than half the service you get at other locations. Been going to Top Golf in AZ since 2014. My kids love the place. We couldn't wait to try out the Vegas location that is supposed to be bigger and better. Definitely bigger, but not better. If you want to charge double, service needs to step it up. One can only hope this is a one off...

Update: Went the other night with some friends and we sat down at a table in the bar area. Sat for 20 minutes and no one acknowledged. Walked by table multiple times clearing other tables that had since departed. Got up and left!"}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly and great here. Stopped in for the weekend and kids of course wanted to play. Tried night golf for the first time and boys had a blast. Food is great here and service is always top notch. Great time and family friendly."}
{"text":"This place is cool.

I came here recently for the first time with a buddy of mine to check the place out.  He had been there before and I hadn't swung a club in years.  Needless to say, I dusted off my clubs and we were off.

(Quick tip: you are not allowed to bring in your drivers but you can check them at the desk if you forget to leave them at home.  They have clubs you can use there)

After checking in, we headed over to our bay and checked out the digs.  The bays are pretty cool in that they have places to secure your clubs and comfy sofas to relax on.  We looked at the available games and started working through them.  There are several styles of games you can play based on the different targets that are out on the range.  It can definitely test you and force you to work on your accuracy.

We had a couple of beers and played for a couple of hours.  I have not had the food yet but I have heard that it is pretty good.  For now, I am satisfied, I had fun, and I am excited to come again in the future."}
{"text":"Fun place to go for a corporate event or with a group of friends. Definitely pricey (food, drinks and the golf). Food is okay but not why you go...you go for the fun atmosphere and ability to hang out with friends. Wait can be long, depending on timing. Staff is often around to order drinks or food from or help with the scoring machine. Bring your own clubs if your a serious golfer."}
{"text":"Well I don't like giving bad reviews but this is an exception.  I love Top Golf and always have fun when I go.  The restaurant however is a different story.  Tonight 6 of us went to the restaurant and for the most part it was ok for the other people in our group, food was good and there were no complaints.  I however cannot say the same.  I told the waiter I wanted the fried chicken sandwich with no cilantro coleslaw on it.  I'm sure he heard me because he nodded his head and said \"No coleslaw\" and I said yes.  Low and behold it was delivered with the coleslaw.  I should have sucked it up and ate it, but I HATE COLESLAW!  Waiter apologized and took it back and promptly forgot about me.  I waited 40 minutes to get my sandwich with no coleslaw on it.  When it arrived I declined to take it.  Everyone else was done eating, and I was a bit upset about it and had lost my appetite by then.  Luckily I grabbed the Tator tots of the original plate to tie me over.  Only problem...they were very cold.  Manager stopped by and apologized I accepted his apology and he said that he would take care of it for us.  Cool!  Well that didn't happen.  We got the check and lo and behold they charged us for the chicken sandwich.  I told the waiter I was not going to pay for something I didn't eat.  He took it off the bill then.  Not acceptable."}
{"text":"This place is INCREDIBLE!!  Disclaimer: I've never done this before... holy smokes people from getting signed up to getting to our bay, the bay host service... everything has been EXCELLENTLY SUPERB!!! It's a mission from where we live, but I promise I'll use any excuse to come back. Also the food and drinks are ON POINT!!! Thank you Topgolf for a fantastic experience"}
{"text":"I paid for a 1-hour individual lesson. I am basically a newbie with a little par 3 experience. Within an hour Ryan had my swing dramatically improved. Well worth the money - and excellent facilities. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Gameplay is fun but horribly disorganized facility.

Bartenders are slow. We could have had 2 drinks before they even took our order.

No reservations taken unless you pay 50 dollars to skip queue, which we only found out late. 

Half the bays were open yet we were made to wait 2 and a half hours, after which we left.

Drinks were good, once we got them, food was decent except for the chips, which were disgusting. Like Doritos without flavoring.

Music was awful.

Typical Scottsdale douche baggery, except with no sense of business and lame customer service.

Prices are also on the high end making the experience even worse."}
{"text":"Tried to order flatbread but was out of the bread. Food was subpar at the best. Had to ask for shot on the side for my Bloody Mary...tasted like all tomato juice. After waiting in my tab I noticed how uncleanly the staff was. The bartender had her foot propped up on the ice bin. Another bartender and two waitresses was observed eating out of the garnish bin...after bartender ate the cherry he picked up he then licked his finger and continued to make drinks and picking up garnish with the same hand he licked!!!!"}
{"text":"I learned about Top Golf because they are building one in my area which is scheduled to open on September 3rd. So, when I found out there was a Top Golf in Vegas I was excited to try it out. I'm an avid golfer and the people with me golf sometimes. Although, that does not really matter here, because the whole idea is to just have a fun time. Almost everybody around us was either not regular golfers or never swung a club in their life; and everybody was having so much fun.
The staff was friendly and helpful. My only complaint was it was hard to hear the woman at the main check-in counter, partly because her voice was not that strong, but also because the accoustics in the main entrance/check-in counter are not that good. It was to noisy, which made it hard to hear.
The gentleman who explained the games and how things worked did a pretty good job. He went kind of fast, but the system was intuitive enough where we were able to work ourselves through it while we were playing.
The clubs kind of suck, but what do you expect for a place like this? For someone who does'nt normally golf, they are fine, for someone who plays even a few times a year you're better off bringing your own clubs.
My only real complaint about the golfing was the rubber tee. It was fine for all the clubs except the driver, since it was only about less than 1/2\" tall. It makes hitting the driver very difficult, even for a decent golfer.
Anyway, overall a very good experience and I can't wait until the Top Golf near me opens."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. For the first time in my life I did not leave a tip. From the moment I got there Alexis acted like being there was a bother to her. As I walked up - her face looking perturbed - she asked if we had a reservation for the bay. She didn't realize that a staff member was following behind us. Thirty minutes later we saw her again and she advised she had an event that she was setting up for and that she wasn't supposed to have anyone in our section and apologized for the delay in coming to us. We let her know it was no problem and no need to apologize. From that point on we saw her sporadically. Everyone in our group had to ask for drinks and items multiple times. She constantly cut and rolled her eyes, never picked up plates, never refilled drinks, and every request seemed to be a nuisance to her. I asked for to go boxes twice and 40 minutes later we had not received the Togo boxes. . . We let her know a third time that we still had not gotten them and her response \"I'm grabbing them (pointed in a general direction) I had other stuff I was doing.\" Then proceeds to reach in the drawer DIRECTLY behind us and grab to go boxes. Ridiculous. TopGolf is usually a great experience. But this week Alexis ruined the experience."}
{"text":"Clean, organized, great customer service.

We arrived at 8pm on a Wednesday night May 17, 2017. We only had to wait 10 minutes. 

We can with 2 other friends, we all came prepared with our TopGolf Member Cards to speed things up.

It was $45 an hour and you get 10% with military discount.

Earlier in the day it's only $25 per hour and per bay. It's not per person. You can have up to 6 people per bay. 

We only played for an hour, but we had a good time and everyone was really friendly."}
{"text":"We called to see if we needed reservations for a group of 8 and the person on the phone said we needed to get in touch with an event coordinator. They were not helpful over the phone at all. 

On a Thursday, we did expect to have to wait or even not get in line at all.

We went to get register for two bays, the person asked if we had a reservation. We said no, we called and they said we cannot get a reservations for a group less than 12. 

They said that's a unique situation. Not having a reservation for a group of 8. They even called their manager out to clarify that we didn't have reservations for a group of 8. They politely told us the wait was too long and we wouldn't be able to get on the waiting list or play tonight.

They gave us $10 off for next time we come it. 
Poor customer service, not professional and just straight up rude."}
{"text":"You don't have to be super good at golf. You just need to be able to hit a ball, land it on the scoring net and have fun. This place is perfect for a group event since they can take up to 6 people per spot. I guess one down side is that you have to wait so long on the weekends but it will go by fast if you hang out in the main bar area and they will text you when it's your turn. They have a huge tv screen at the bar so you can watch sports games too!"}
{"text":"Cost friendly, super fun and great for dates or groups! Recommend getting the 3rd level!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Top Golf location. Timber was my server this time and she was amazing! Food came out on time and she was so pleasant to be around and catering to mine and my family's needs"}
{"text":"I came for my birthday. Their  was a mix-up with credits on my membership account but was able to still let us play the bay .Overall it was a good experience.

Surprisingly it was packed on a Wednesday night like really packed.
There was a 2 1/2 hour wait for a bay but we had planned on eating anyways so that wasn't an issue. The food and drink menu is varied and everyone was able to order to their liking. I will not I ordered a corona-rita and my waitress said they didn't have one which is weird.

Pros: Menu, music,staff, bay reservation alert via text
Cons: Parking- I don't understand why more parking wasn't planned. 
The process for getting your physical membership card in one line then getting in another to reserve a bay; process was not smooth and definitely needs to be improved especially when busy. 

Tips: Definitely carpool or Uber if possible. go with the intention to eat so the possible 2-hour wait doesn't seem so shocking"}
{"text":"Always a good time here. We went around 5:30pm on a Saturday and did not have to wait for a booth. Booth was clean and staff was very friendly. The booth had a little mister that shot out a cool mist every so often so that was nice for the Vegas heat. It was a little on the pricey side (but I have to remember it was a Saturday evening in Vegas). I would recommend this Top Golf."}
{"text":"Food was good typical bar fare (3.5 stars is about right) . I don't like the fact that you can't bring your own clubs here. Heard you can at some of the other locations. I'll try another location next time."}
{"text":"Had an unpleasant experience at Top Golf and it was my first time.   Our friends had a $200 credit so we were going to be there a few hours having fun or so we thought.  We were not even there 45 mins, the server cut our friend off after two shots, while we were allowed to continue to purchase the $20 drinks.  It killed our whole vibe.  I will say the food is good, drinks are ok but the service all around sucks!  

The servers are a bunch of girls and guys all stuck on themselves and flirting with each other all day!  While at the top level bar we witnessed our bartender taking selfies in between making drinks! 

Would I go back?  Probably not.  Vegas is supposed to be about service, which is not what I experienced at Top Golf."}
{"text":"When to top golf for the first time a few months ago with my husband and our friend who is a Vegas native. The golf was fun and the games were a blast. But my main issues have to deal with the customer service that we received.

Side note: our bartender that we dealt with in the second level was fantastic and the only reason why I didn't give one star. He was a blast, and was very attentive to us. 

Getting back to the poor customer service on the Bay Area. The lady that took our order seemed to care less about our table but FAR MORE ATTENTIVE  to the group of young men behind us, and seemed to be flirting too. Which I would not mind if she ever brought us our drinks. We had to ask another waitress who was walking by to grab her and have her bring us our drinks. Finally they came, and they were delicious (hats off to the bartender!). After our game time expired we were still waiting for our check, and then another 10 minutes goes by and no sight of our waitress. We grab another waitress( who was amazingly sweet) to grab her or our check. She couldn't find her and just brought us our check for us! She was great and the bartenders! 

Needless to say, not impressed, see no need to return, AND WE LOVE GOLF!"}
{"text":"So I got here and I ordered 6 shots. First 3 were liquor and the next 3 where ordered chilled.... chilled means with ice. Do not order chilled shots. It means watered down...."}
{"text":"We always have a great time here and after visiting the Edison NJ location, we were so glad that we would finally get a Topgolf near our new home. We have so much fun with the different games because none of us can play golf if our lives depended on it. The drinks are good, the food is good. The only thing I would say is that with the set up of their service, I would order and eat inside or outside. The people that serve inside at the bar get ripped off in tips when people transfer their tab outside. I don't think that is fair since we did the majority of our ordering, eating inside. Once you get outside, make sure they give you silverware. I don't know why but they never seem to remember to give us silverware."}
{"text":"EXPENSIVE - LONG WAIT - POOR PARKING
$90/hr and a 2 hour wait!!!
Mandatory $5 surcharge that they dont tell you about until you get to your lane.
$5 soda cups.
Fun atmosphere

First of all this place is NOT for locals and NOT for golfers. It's a nightclub tourist trap that happens to have a drive range attached. Locals and people who actually want to golf - go to a local municipal range for $8 all day. That being said...

PARKING:
Parking was horrendous. You have to valet and traffic was backed up out on Koval. Fights among motorists on Koval Ln. No self parking. Sat in valet for 15 mins before they took my car. When I tried to leave it was a 30 minute wait to get my car out of valet! Your best bet would be to Uber to MGM Grand or Hard Rock Café and walk over.

PRICES:
The prices are a complete rip off. $90 for 1 hour and then its a 2-3 hour wait to get a lane. Then when you get to your lane they hit you with this $5/day surchage bullsheet that there is no mention of at the check in counter. So in addition to the rates there is another $5 fee. Food is priced reasonably but drinks are outrageous. Soda cups are $5.

WAIT TIMES:
Just ridiculous. Massive bottleneck of people as soon as you enter. Upon checking in at the main counter I was told the wait for a range was 1.5hrs. We waited 2 hrs before we got a lane. They text you that a lane is avail and you have to wait in line yet again at the main counter.

STAFF:
Very friendly employees but lack of communication between employees. Waitresses all smokin' hot 21 year old females with extremely short skirts (they didn't get their jobs due to experience or college education, trust me). Guys...expect to hand over some big tips.

This place is definitely fun, awesome atmosphere and all that. But it's just way too overpriced and the wait times and parking are just insane."}
{"text":"First time going to Top Golf, but I am very glad our group decided to come here to celebrate a couple friend's birthdays. When we initially arrived on a Saturday night at around 9:30pm, we expected it to be super busy with a long wait, but we were wrong. We only waited 15 minutes for our Level 3 bay. The whole experience was top-notch! It felt like being at a lounge/club-like atmosphere along with a high-tech driving range where the balls are tracked via RFID so it can precisely score where you hit the color target areas. Our hostess and other employees were very friendly and attentive. The drinks were alright and the best food item we ordered were the \"adult\" donut holes. I highly recommend that dessert especially going in the evening after having dinner. I will definitely be back to Top Golf next time I'm in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"3 stories of golf bays and girl's serving drinks and food in Capri pants... breathtaking mountain views in the background and a patio upstairs with more games and fun. Foose ball, grown up bar version of jenga, video games as well. Night time is more like a club atmosphere. Days see more serious ( read real) golfers. And there is nothing like watching a hottie in heels try to golf after shaking her hips to rap music. Led alone do well at it. Great for groups looking for fun."}
{"text":"Visited this location from out of town (Texas) where I have visited the Dallas, Las Colinas, and Austin locations. Every experience I have at the Dallas location is awful (service could NOT be worse). This location had friendly service but they don't allow you to use tees. REALLY? They claim it's because some people have hit the ball over the 300 ft netted wall. So now everyone else is forced to shoot from one of your 3 remaining clubs that don't require a tee? We played from the bottom floor which basically meant we couldn't aim for anything other than the three holes directly in front of us. For the amount you pay to play here to basically hit a wedge, 8, or 6 iron, I'm sorry this fucking blew. We had planned on coming tomorrow too but not anymore. We'll take our 300+ dollars of business to the casino instead, since the few people who are that awful at hitting a driver ruined it for everyone else."}
{"text":"Service was top notch. Everyone from the first person who greeted and filled us in on how things work, to our food server. 
Food was surprisingly excellent too.  We ordered the taco party platter plus some wings. Was good amount for 5 hungry guys.  Everyones favorite seemed to be between the bulgogi and carnitas tacos.
As far as the golf, I am no pro and i thought it was super fun.  Prices are reasonable.  If you want to have a relax fun time with some food and drinks, this place is the spot. Would def. go again."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! My husband typically entertains clients there when in town and said it would be fun for us to go as a family with the kiddos. He was right! Our boys had a blast, we had a blast, the food is delicious, and the service is exceptional by each and every employee. Everywhere you turn someone's greeting you with a smile, asking if we would like something and returning with drinks and food in a flash. Will surely come back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Nice bar inside. Make sure you have plenty of people to share your pad. That way you rotate playing games and get your money's worth. We had 3 people and only 2 played. It gets old lol....and tiring."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place. If you have a group of friends and  don't mind spending a fairly high amount for food, drinks and some round robin golf, then you gotta try this place. 

With over thirty family and friends in town for the big game, (UH vs UNLV), we wanted to do some kind of outing that we all could enjoy and still allow for everyone to spend time visiting. 

Cousin mark set it up. Our reservation was for 10pm. Not sure if that's the last time or not, but after two and half hours of fun, we where walking out to an almost empty place. 

Upon arriving, there was a live band playing, there are two levels, we where on top. The room reserved was quite large with an enclosed glass surround, long table for eating, a center bar with two tee's. There where couches and smaller tables for sitting and socializing offering a place to set your drink. 

Once the food and drinks had been ordered, we took turns practicing our swing, trying to get that connection that would send that little white ball sailing through the air and land just right in the colorful holes out on the range. I never made it and gave up. It was too much fun watching the others connect!

There are large screen TV's for staying up with all things sports, a private bathroom in the suite and two very attentive servers, keeping the food and drinks flowing! It's a great place to enjoy good company. Definitely should be on the to do list."}
{"text":"I've been to this top golf lacrion a few times and this trip we had timber. She was amazing so friendly. Not only was her service amazing but she made our experience memorable with her outgoing personality. Well definitely be back"}
{"text":"Fun place to come to with friends. I went in and they weren't very good at explaining everything to it was a bit confusing at first. The explanation could've been better but overall had a great time"}
{"text":"Ordered 6 items and only got 3 and after like )have an hour of finishing the 3 items(food) we got we told the server that we are missing 3 more items and the she said \"what were they again?\" so from that we knew they didn't make the remaining 3 items yet and if we were going to wait for them to make those items, it would be another 30 more minutes or more, it was my first time and unfortunately i'm never coming back again"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome! We had a great time here although it's a little embarrassing when you're not a golfer and are sitting next to a bay of golfers.but who cares right? Great place for all ages. You have to pay$5 for a registration card which I find odd, but it's supposed to be lifetime so I guess it's fine. Then you pay per hour. Make sure you tell them if you're not ready to start your time or else valuable $$$ will be wasted! You get your own private bay with a tv and either high chairs or couches to accommodate your group. Food and drinks is a la carte so your night of posh driving range can add up really quickly. The games they offer are fun but I still don't know how it tracks my specific ball when I hit it in the range. Technology is amazing! Everything we ordered was delicious although they ran out of a lot of food. No chicken and waffles, no crab cakes and no calamari. Bummer since I wanted to try all 3! The sign says Purell is located everywhere but I didn't see any and considering I'm a germaphobe, I would suggest having one at every bay. Lastly, they are pet friendly! You're forced to be on the first floor unless you're a service dog and then you can be anywhere. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great service! If only I knew how to play golf properly, I would look less of an idiot....Nice venue! Great staff! Reasonable food and beverage prices...."}
{"text":"Such a great place to hang out with friends, have some drinks and hit some balls. Impeccable service, amazing venue and great energy is what you always get when you come here. The good is great also! The cabana platters are delicious. Would definitely recommend Top Golf to visitors as well as locals."}
{"text":"This place is great!! No matter if you golf or not you will have fun! Kids are welcome; We took our 12 year old daughter!"}
{"text":"I went to TopGolf on Saturday with my husband, parents, and a friend from out of town. While the gameplay was fun, the customer service was absolutely pitiful. The check-in process was extremely confusing and the staff was not helpful. I would make sure to give any newcomer a thorough explanation of the check-in process before visiting in hopes they don't have the same experience I did. 

With 3 of us playing being new, we were a little unsure where we needed to go first. We went to the front desk and they told us we needed to get in line for Guest Services. We went across the lobby and waited in line for Guest Services. We were finally helped by two separate cashiers, but since we were all playing in the same bay, we moved to one cashier. They asked if we wanted our own player cards, and not knowing, we asked what they recommended. They said we can all play on one player card and since we'd have to pay for extras, we decided just to use the one player card. We didn't even know what the player cards did. 

We walked back over to the front desk where we were given clubs and taken to our bay. While the employee was getting us set up, he told us we'd all have to play under the same name with only one player card. We, of course, did not want to do this. It's like bowling with only one player on the screen - no one does that! So we had to go back inside to get player cards.

I went to the front desk and told them I'd just been there, but I was told I needed a player card. The employee said I needed to go to Guest Services, where the line had tripled in length since we were just there. I said, \"Wait, seriously? We have to wait in that line even though we were just here??\" She just said, \"Yep.\" No apology. No sympathy for the pregnant woman (me) having to stand in line for the next 10+ minutes after already waiting in line for 5 minutes earlier. There were about 5 employees at the front desk standing around doing nothing. 

The cashiers in guest services were also not apologetic about the situation and couldn't seem to care any less about all the inconvenience we encountered to try to play. I was visibly upset and no one apologized.

The staff seemed extremely under-trained and under-experienced, and I will not rush to bring my business back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a team event or to go with a group of friends. We had no wait during lunch on a weekday or at 11:30 on a Sunday. The most popular game is a lot of fun and great for people who don't play golf. It's easy for those who don't hit the ball well to still get a decent amount of points making it to the targets. The food is also pretty good. The G.O.A.T and the injectable donut holes were my favorite menu items. The mac and cheese spring rolls, chicken and waffle sliders, buffalo chicken flatbread, and mushi were also very good. We enjoyed the Bloody Mary and Citrus Cabana as well. This is definitely a place worth checking out. We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"April fools or not, their cocktails are as WEAK as charmin but love the customer service and all around concept. Just stop cutting corners."}
{"text":"So happy Vegas had one. Great experience and friendly staff. Our server Amy was very attentive and nice. Will definitely come back next time we are in Vegas; it's a great way to hang out with friends, have fun, and get a little fresh air."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit to Topgolf, The first visit I left without eating or playing. We had a 2.5 hour wait time, so we decided to eat while waiting. We sat in the restaurant for 36 minutes without anyone coming over or even being acknowledged, so we left. Because of the hype I decided to give it another shot. This time we arrived earlier and the wait time was only 1.5 hours. Again we tried the restaurant, and was greeted after about 10 minutes after we sat down (self seating)The wait time for the bay was shorter than expected (40 minuets) we had to transfer our food to our bay. I truly enjoyed this visit, food was good, cocktails even better. My 6 year old really enjoyed himself and we plan on returning this weekend.  I would recommend as a good spot for kids but also a good date spot."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, amazing bars and golf and fun and games.  This is where I want to be when the world ends."}
{"text":"Why don't we have one of these in San Diego?!  I came here with some friends when I was in town and I'll admit that I was skeptical at first. I'm not a golfer AT ALL but, I had a really great time! The nice thing is that you don't have to be good at golfing to do well here. I was the least experienced golfer in my group and I didn't even get last place. If you can hit your ball into 1 of the 11 targets (ranging from 20 to 240 yards), you'll get points, which will automatically show up on a screen at your table so you don't have to keep track manually. The concept is a lot like bowling, but it's a driving range. It might seem a little expensive, but it really isn't if everyone playing chips in. 

Another great feature this place has to offer is the bar. More than likely, there will be a wait to play golf because this place is so popular but, you can go hang out in the bar and eat/drink while you wait. It's no different than going to any other bar just to hang out. The atmosphere is really fun and energetic (all of the employees are always dancing and being goofy) so I would probably hang out there even if there wasn't a wait to play golf. Before you know it, it'll be your turn to hit some balls and the fun will continue!"}
{"text":"TopGolf Vegas is perfect must check out spot if you like Sports, Golf, Drinking, Plenty of TV's and only at this location you have a sports book, video poker at the full bar and rooftop swimming pool. They also stage for live bands and trendy comfortable sitting areas. It's great for groups because the pricing is typical Vegas! Definitely caters to golfing enthusiasts and sports fans. 

$8 for beers is not bad for Vegas but $60 for an hour is kinda pricey for the first and second levels during the afternoon. I have not hit golf balls for longest time so I was shanking balls. My experience would be better if they had staff to improve your swing."}
{"text":"Staff was rude at the bay. Rushed us out by taking our drinks before we were finished. Wouldnt finish letting us hit the balls dispensed during our hour. Very disappointed in the service. Doesnt compare to other Top Golf facilities. Oh and there are no stadium lights to see your ball after dark and no pro tracer either."}
{"text":"The only reasons I give this place a 4 Star is the price and if you have a party of 6 or less when making a reservation, they will charge you an arm and a leg in food and booze. I was particularly not too happy with the sales person Lucy who wouldn't give my group a little break when a few people couldn't make it. When we got there, one of the managers gladly took a good amount off the bill for us to help. It really restored faith in this place! Still, to swing some clubs around for a short time, you better bring your wallet! Make sure and call to check prices before you come so you know what you're in for. Now as far as this place and how much fun it is... it's a lot of fun! If you really like golf, you should do this for 3 hours if you have 4 or more people with you. I am very impressed with this place when it comes down to it with the music and vibe. Thanks and I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It's great to go with family and friends to have a fun time! We usually go here on Sunday funday, to let loose and have a good time. They have good food and drinks, the wings are some of the best I've had, and they also have good chicken fingers. The service is great and the staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Cool facility.  Impossible to get in.  We were told 3 hour wait.  We are going on hour 4.   We haven't touched a ball.  They keep saying that there is two people in front of us and now there are 4 people in front of us.  How is that possible? Super disappointed so far."}
{"text":"We tried to book a corporate event at their faculty.  We have 15 people going which requires two booths at 75 per hour each. We asked that they they be next to each other, they said yes but they would have to double the price to a total of $300 per hour for two booths. I asked why and they simply replied, that's our policy.  I asked about food and they told me for 15 people they have a $800 minimum. The total for a two hour event for 15 people reached $1,600 dollars.  This is insulting to me and my group. I will never give them one dollar and I play a lot of golf and was very excited to use their facility. 

I would recommend that locals avoid this awful business. Thank you for listening to my rant."}
{"text":"Great music,  good food. .. awesome customer service. .. fair prices. .. definitively a good hang out,  especially for groups.  I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Chandler (like the city) was excellent. Great waiter!!  Much better than his brother, according to him.  Had a great time"}
{"text":"I have always wanted to go to the golf course and hit some rounds. My friends and I decided to check out Top Golf while in Vegas and boy was it an adventure. As a newbie to golf I definitely struggled with picking the right club and hitting the ball but it was fun and cheap. We went before noon so it was $30/hr for the bay. Each player gets 20 balls. We took turns but you could hit them all at once if you prefer. You pick your club and wave it over the sensor and a ball is kicked out to you. Then the swinging begins. If you are like me then you will spend lots of time swinging and missing the ball. You aim at the various targets and the closer inward the higher the points. The balls contain sensors and the points are automatically computed. You are given the option to extend your time during your remaining 15 mins. We declined but only because we had other places we wanted to check out. We all agreed that we would definitely do it again and that we had fun. 

Seating area: The bays are separated with short sectionals and a table. You can order food and drinks and they are brought to you. Each bay has a separate tv, separate clubs for both men and women, and score tracker. 

There are also seats at the bar. 

1st and 2nd level are for adults and kids. Levels 3 and 4 are adult only 21+ and includes a pool. Levels 1 & 2: $30 before noon, $45 after noon, and $60 for the evening time slots. Levels 3 & 4: $45 before noon, $60 after noon, and I cannot recall the evening price. 

New players must get a membership for $5 but it last for a lifetime. We chose the top shot game since we are rookies. We didn't get any alcoholic drinks although they offered a nice selection. Instead we opted for fountain drinks. Drinks before noon make me sluggish and kills my productive. 

We encountered a minor issue when my friend could not locate her coin purse. Luckily she had left it in the car. The staff deserves MAJOR KUDOS. The staff that provides the drinks searched for us very thoroughly. The guy in charge of security assisted as well as the manager. I think his name was Das. Everyone went into search mode. Our bay neighbors also assisted with searching. It was great news to find out that it was not missing just misplaced but in a safe place. So the good news is if an issue does arise here they will definitely go above and beyond to take care of you and help anyway they can."}
{"text":"This place is HUGE. The staff here are welcoming and are everywhereeeeeee. Doors were opened and orders taken quickly. We really wanted 3rd floor, but we had a minor with us so we settled for 2nd. The facility is technology friendly. 

After choosing a club (female and male differ), you wave it over the sensor and a ball pops out. Across the course you have colored hole markers, marking score as you make it into them. I couldn't believe the advanced tech. TV screens informed you of where exactly the ball went into. Trust me, keeping track of that tiny thing is hard. No, the ball cars have no points if you hit the poor suckers. 

Ok....fyi. I SUCKED. Not just kinda sucked, but was insanely horrible. I scored like 10 while everyone got over 20. My only comment on this place would be to wish they had someone show you how to swing a club in order for me to actually hit the ball rather than spending half my time swining air. It was nice to see others sucking just as bad, so I didnt feel too terrible. 

I'm definitely coming back! Local discount for Nevada residents! Check online before coming."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love to come to Topgolf anytime we visit Charlotte. He is an avid golfer.. I have been golfing less than 10 times in my life. We both always have a blast. 

Topgolf is basically a driving range with certain targets to aim for. The golf balls have gps, so a computer in your bay tracks where you land. There are several options of games to play that you select on said computer. There are several clubs to chose from in each bay. The bays also have heaters that do a good job of keeping the seating area warm when it is cold out. Each bay also has a table, chairs, and a server for drinks and food.

While visiting this morning we ordered a few mimosas and beers, and our server was quick in bringing them out. We definitely want to try one of the \"Golfbag\" drinks if we're ever back in the evening.

It can be pricey but the prices increase later in the day, so you can plan a visit early in the day to save money. We went around 10 a.m. this morning and it was still decently busy. It was $25/bay/hour until noon. You can have up to 6 people in a bay, so you can come with friends to make it more affordable.

Overall, a very fun experience for any group. We will continue to visit!"}
{"text":"As a local, i thought this place started so great and promising! With their hundreds of staff members, nobody answered our call on 4/11/2018. So we went there, there was a 2 hour wait time. Sitting at the bar area was terrible. Really, customer service and the long queue is an issue. The website does not really help. Hope this business lasts. =("}
{"text":"I'm not a Golfer...so I had no real interest in going to TopGolf...but I had some friends in town and wanted to show them a good time and chat some, plus her husband loves golf.

Well we went to TopGolf and had the best time ever.  It's just like bowling as far as scoring, but with golf balls.  The place is absolutely amazing, it looks great, the employees were very fun and friendly, and the food was delicious and not over priced.   After a few swings I got the hang of it and did pretty well...I didn't win but I look forward to returning and working on my golf skills...  really great family friendly place, great place to hang out with friends...something different in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! Opening on June 9th, 2017 this will be the Charlotte area's new \"Go To Place.\"

The concept is simple, and brilliant. You come in, get a membership card (lifetime card costs $5) which you will use to pay for everything. You rent a bay and enjoy unlimited golf with your coworkers, friends or family while being waited on by friendly and fun staff members. The pricing model is simple - see my photos for current pricing at the time of the review. You pay for the bay, which can be split among members of your party if you wish. The bay is yours with unlimited balls for the duration you have it, and it includes your own two sets of clubs.

On the right (see photos) you will see clubs with Carolina Blue (GO HEELS!) inlay, those are women's flex. Those on the left are men's flex. They do not include gloves, so I suggest bringing your own as we did. You can also opt to bring your own clubs if you prefer. 

Once at your bay, you set up your team (similar to the process at a bowling alley.) You can have up to 6 people per bay, and your bay has it's own private seating area and table, plus a dedicated TV you can control.

Each bay has a large outdoor heater, as well as a fan to help you stay comfortable. There are waiters who go around to get your food & drink orders. The food and drinks were fantastic! We tried everything from:
* Jumbo shrimp with homemade cocktail sauce (not too spicy) with grated ginger & avocado
* Mushi - Mexican sushi with a touch of Sriracha
* Smoked Prime Rib
* Charred broccolini
* Deliciously soft roles and soft whipped butter (who doesn't love good bread & butter)?
* Chopped Greek-style salad with pecans
* Mini loaded potato wedges with ranch on the side
* Fresh seared scallops
* Donut holes with injectible fillings (raspberry jelly, chocolate, and Bavarian - don't be afraid to mix them up!)

I learned the hard way the donut injectors have caps that need screwed off. Take them off or you'll make a mess like I did! My favorite was mixing the rasberry with the creme. YUM!

The drink prices were reasonable and modest, and they have something for everyone. Should you have to wait for a bay (even though they have THREE levels of bays), you can grab a seat or a table at any level. (Again, see photos.)

There is abundant space to rent for meetings, conferences, weddings, banquets, birthdays, bachelor parties, etc. They can cater for whatever you need. They are also VERY sensitive to food allergies and unique dietary needs. Their cheeses were all pasteurized (for any fellow preggos out there), and they can accommodate allergies.

The overall vibe was friendly, fun and lighthearted. Great music flowed throughout, and at night when the targets are really glowing, the lights put on a show of sorts as they dance to the music.

When you're ready to golf, you simply grab your club, approach the mat and wave your ball over the large red dot in the top right of the target map (in front of your map). You'll know it worked because a green light will flash from the dispenser letting you know your micro-chipped ball is on its way. You can do this with your hand, or any club... The chip allows the system to keep your score and know which ball was yours. If you don't get it in a target, your score for that ball is 0. The further the target and closer to the center, the higher the score. Each \"game\" includes 20 balls. You get unlimited balls/games for the time you have the booth rented. 

This was so much fun, and we can't wait to go back. It's conveniently located off 485 with ample parking. It's family friendly, could work for a work mixer, or as a quasi night-scene for drinks, dancing, food, and of course, golf."}
{"text":"Food, drinks, golf and REPEAT!!! I came here for a birthday gathering. I love how they did this place. Its so fun and it's great to bring friends and family, Especially a group of us. Great atmosphere and great service. Down stairs they have pool, and games on the tv. We had a blast!"}
{"text":"The staff was great and friendly. Very attentive to your needs when you are golfing and looking for a drink. A fun time for all, even if you  are not a golfer. Me and my husband enjoyed 3 hours of great atmosphere, music, drinks and food. There are 2 pools on the top floors for everyone 21 & over. They have a family friendly floor with games for all to play Bathrooms were big, clean with lockers. If you go before noon it is only $30 for an hour (plus one time membership fee of $5 per person). We were on the 3rd floor and paid $75/ hr but it was well worth the fun. Each bay has a small L shaped couch with a table and lots of misters everywhere. Vegas is hot and they clearly got climate control down to perfection. We will be going back soon. Great time!"}
{"text":"Been there three times and had a great time.  Food was surprisingly good, expected cheap bar food and it was actually really good.  Service was average and the drinks are a bit spendy but overall a great time.  Please do not bring babies and toddlers to this place as there is no childcare and no place for little ones to run around. The last time we had to listen to a 3 year old cry and scream for an hour because there was nothing for him to do..."}
{"text":"This was a very great place and affordable! It's a good place when to bring a lot of people too. Wess our guest service rep was great!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Fun for the whole family. Even if your not a golfer it still has its perks. We love to come here! Thanks for all the fun top golf! Food and drinks are also amazing."}
{"text":"Fun place to go! Definitely a pain waiting to get your initial member card...very loud in lobby and with the high popularity it's a mad house, especially on Saturday's. Once you get your card it's much smoother. The wait staff are great, at least ours was. Food is aight, I'd pass on it since it's expensive enough as it is to just play. It's much better when you split the cost per hour with friends. Hour is fun, two hours is plenty, especially if you suck at golf and bend your wrist (ouch). 

I will definitely be bringing more out of town guests to play golf, it's a cool place to go!"}
{"text":"The Las Vegas location is an excellent experience. For a place like top golf it's the staff that will make or break your evening. The waitstaff is attentive and management wants to make sure you had the experience you were hoping for. After a night that didn't end well for my group Carrie from the management team took the time to reach out and make it right. I appreciate the dedication to customer service and the desire to develop repeat business."}
{"text":"My hubby and I came here for date night.  Disclaimer...we both have not touched golf clubs in the last decade probably but we still had fun.  It's a pricey place, but you come in expecting as much.  We enjoyed the game concept of it versus going to a golfing range, even though technically this is a glorified golfing range.  They provide the clubs and the balls.  The balls are tracked so you know where they land and depending on the game...they equate to a certain amount of points.  For locals or military, they have a discount...so don't forget to mention that to your server.  Or if you go earlier before noon...they also offer discounts.  We picked the tier 1 since we wanted minimal wait time, and less witnesses to our subpar golf skills.  Next time, I'd try the upper levels since they offer a better for view.  I would eat dinner before I get here, the food was mediocre at best.  We got the pork skewers as a snack...and they were as dry as jerky.  Probably best with a group of 4 if your only going for an hour, any additional people and you won't get to hit too many balls."}
{"text":"I took friends here that were visiting from out of state who love  to golf on Oct 10th 2014. We went to rent out two golfing stations and there was some type of glitch in the computer system. We had a rock star in training who was waiting on us and was having some issue with the computer. We were patiently waiting for at least 20 minutes to have the issue solved. I am not sure what happened however the manager Cory came over fixed the problem and comped both stations for free for the inconvenience. Now that's what I call great customer service. Thanks Top Golf, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Apparently they are very busy even on a Tuesday night, I tried to call multiple times but the automatic recording kept on telling me that all staff members are busy, so I was kept on hold. Finally got fed up and had to email them to ask my question. I work as a ER nurse at a hospital a few miles away from Topgolf, and a few patients told me about it so I decided we would give it a try for my boyfriends birthday. One patient had told me that they do not allow you to bring in a birthday cake, unless you spend the extra money and plan an event. I figured this wasn't true.....since every restaurant, amusement park, bowling alley ect. I've ever been to lets you bring in birthday cakes.  The Topgolf website says no outside food or drinks, which I think it completely appropriate EXCEPT FOR BIRTHDAY CAKE/CUPCAKES! I received an email from Topgolfs Senior Events Coordinator Lauren Colvin, confirming that you are not allowed to bring birthday cakes ( I did not email her, what a coincidence the person that responded to my email is the person who books the events). I then called Topgolf again a few days later, and the lady who answered the phone said you can bring in your own birthday cake, if you pay the extra money to plan an event. I'm not sure if anyone has looked at the prices for events but they are expensive......and do not include alcohol. I sent out an Evite over a month ago, informing our friends and family that we are planning on going to TopGolf as walk-in guest and celebrating my boyfriends birthday. Last count there will be over thirty people, who are planning on eating, drinking, and playing golf. So now the dilemma is do I changed the party to somewhere more accommodating for birthdays entirely? Or go there and golf for an hour and then hold the celebration elsewhere where they allow you to actually personalize the birthday experience? This might not bother other people like it does me, but I do believe it is important fact to know before planning on celebrating your birthday at Topgolf."}
{"text":"Super disappointed with my experience here. Servers and food were great- quoted two hours - waited over 3, open bays... lip service on why. Just disappointing when you travel to experience something and it falls far below expectations."}
{"text":"Golfing and food what is there not to love about this place. This is definitely a great place to come and hang out with a group of friends.  The food was your typical like bar food but we had no complaints with the wings and flat bread pizza.  Its just a perfect spot for a Friday night out."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on Saturday night (3/10/18) with 8 other folks and had a blast.  Here are my quick thoughts on a few things about Top Golf..................

- Be prepared to wait!  2.5 hour wait on a Saturday afternoon (4pm).  Finally got into our bay at about 6:45 or so.  They do text you before your bay is ready, so if you want to go somewhere else and come back, you can.  We just chilled upstairs and played Jenga and chilled the whole time.  The wait is fine if you are with a group, but would be a deal breaker (for me at least) if it was just you and another person on a date or something.  2.5 hours is a LONG TIME to wait for something.

- Incredible service!  Everyone from the bartenders to the front desk, to the managers on duty, to the person assigned to your bay.  Everyone was friendly, helpful and overall in a good mood!

- Food was decent.  We got some chips/salsa/guacamole and some pretzel bites and they were all tasty.  Reasonably priced, too.  I got a Pepsi and it came with free refills all night.

- The Golf.  That's the reason you came here, right?  The golfing part of it was fun.  You can play a slew of different \"games\" and the computer does the scoring for you.  Purchase a membership card for a one time fee of $5.00.  Otherwise, it doesn't keep score or track your progress.

-  Sensors on the balls seemed a bit \"off\".  We played a game of \"Top Drive\" and my one buddy was crushing the shit out of the ball into the intended targets, but it was not registering.  Meanwhile, I can't drive worth a damn, and was hitting maybe 140 yards, and was getting credit for scoring points.  Something was up.  Still fun, but not an accurate scoring system to tell us who actually won.

- If possible, get a bay on the 2nd or 3rd floor.  We got ours on the first floor all the way down at the end (Bay 102) which was a little whack.  All the scoring targets were at an angle, and since you were on the bottom floor, it was hard to judge and sometimes even see the actual target you were aiming at.  It would be much, much better up top looking down.

- Price.  $50.00 an hour on weekends after 5pm.  Seems a bit steep, but when you divide it by your party, it comes out very reasonable.  There were 5 of us that split the cost so for almost 2.5 hours, plus membership, it was only like $30.00 each.  I felt that was very reasonable for the amount of fun we had.  Go during the week and you can get it as low as $25.00 an hour.

Overall, I had a great time.  The wait to get a bay and the sensors (occasionally) were my only complaints.  Good times...so much so, I am coming back sometime this week with my other friends that are coming out for Spring Training.  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"The wait was long. They told us 1.5 hrs. But was more like 2.75 hrs. Bar staff was nice, hence the 3 stars"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place, I went here for a date night. Be prepared to wait. My friend and I decided not to golf and just visit the restaurant instead. The place was packed! However I stood at the bar and within the five minutes I stood there two bar tenders offered to get me something. So the bar staff seems to have it together as far as customer service. I didn't sit at the bar because within that five minutes a table came open. However the table was dirty and it took about ten minutes to get it cleaned off. (You have to sit yourself and flag someone down to clean the table) After placing my order for food and drinks it did not take long to arrive. Food and drinks were as expected pretty good but can't say the best I ever had. For it to be a place that just opened the staff overall doesn't seem to be to friendly. Also along with the bar they have a restaurant, pool tables and the golf section. They also have a lounge downstairs which is where the pool tables are. They do offer valet parking. Also you will notice police presence both inside and out which mean they have some sort of security in place. Prices are also reasonable. So if you can deal with all the people not a bad place to grab a drink and a bit even if you don't golf!"}
{"text":"They definitely have system and booking issues but overall a good time. We paid a reservation fee but couldn't extend after being told we could, then got moved, but they made it right."}
{"text":"If you like hanging out at a bar this is better! The golf is a blast and the prices are reasonable. The food is very good but the service is a bit slow so the food is a bit cold. Still a great time to spend with friends and family!"}
{"text":"Lots of fun for everyone- both Golfers and spectators. Huge movie Screens all over the place to view sports. Nicely thought out layout-from restrooms to sitting rooms, bars, swimming pool area and music that was playing-stimulating all senses. Great menu and drink selections and food was visually appealing and tasty! Service was great. Giovanni was outstanding and pleasant-checking on us at appropriate times. 
The golf menu was a little confusing. It needs to define that the rates are based on 6 players / per hour. 
We will definitely recommend to friends and will be back."}
{"text":"I have to let you know right away that I'm not a golfer and have never swung a club except for miniature golf.  While visiting Las Vegas, my friend Brian suggested we go to Top Golf because he had heard of it and wanted to try it because he is the golfer.  
This place is located on Koval Lane, behind the MGM Grand.  If you park in the MGM garage, you will have a very long to golf.  This place has it's own parking lot and valet service.  When you enter, the staff that greets you is very friendly and helpful. The membership fee is only $5 and we signed up for an hour.  Since it was during the afternoon, it cost us $60, but night time will cost $75.  
Each bay is set up with couches, tables so that you can enjoy a drink and/or food while hitting balls. The staff will help you if needed to set up the computer screen so that you compete with others in your party.  Each ball is chipped so that when you hit the ball, the screen will show how far you hit it and will tally your score. Lots of fun for the competitive golfers!!
We didn't try the food as we had just eaten lunch about an hour earlier so I can't comment yet on that, but I did enjoy myself a lot.  It was a fun way to renew friendly competition among old friends.  
To get in the easiest, I would say go during the week and in the afternoon as there were many open bays around us.  I'm guessing if I were a golfer, this rating would be 4 or 5 stars."}
{"text":"Came here for a bday! Lexi, Josh(in the bar) and Anthony have been soo amazing! The food was great we miss the crab cakes, however the 26$ bottle of prosecco is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Had a great visit to this location.  We are platinum members in Colorado and stopped by here.  Our host Michelle was very kind and efficient to get us to a bay and playing.  She was very friendly and knowledgable!  Our server Betsy was fantastic also!  Great to talk with, suggested great beers for us to try and very attentive!  Then of course the place and games are a blast!  Food left a bit to be desired, but with Michelle and Betsy you couldn't do better!"}
{"text":"First time at Top Golf.  Went for a work event.  Had a blast.  We had two stations reserved and food and drinks catered.  The chicken skewers were awesome!

Even with it being over 110 degrees outside, the misters and fans helped keep it somewhat cool."}
{"text":"Top golf is a fun experience for all skill levels and ages. Really enjoyed our time there. We bought two hours of play and could have kept going. The food was tasty and the service was prompt. I love the experience we all had."}
{"text":"My husband and I were on vacation and came here with friends who live in the area. Such a FUN place!!! This was our first time at any top golf. It was a little confusing when we first got there. There was a greeter who told us to go to the desk to sign up for a membership (5$) but told us only one person was allowed up there at a time. I went up there and told them we were going to get some food first and they told us to just come back after we had food. The food was really good!!! 3 of us had the chicken and waffle sliders! YUMMMMM! We had a craft of mimosas too! Great way to start the morning! Once we got to our bay, we had a server there right away asking us if we wanted drinks. The games were so fun! We had a blast!!"}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun to go to with a group of 6 people. I went for my friend's birthday and she had a party of 12. The line outside to purchase a $5 membership card (needed to play) was super long. Due to the cold weather, one would think the management here would come up with a more effective way to get the line moving. After getting the membership we went to the bar area and got the Pineapple punch golf bag drink ($16). We were told that we couldn't order the drink individually and that there had to be two ppl available to drink it. I think this is just some sort of gimmick to make people think that the drink is very large or very strong. The drink was neither. It was an average sized drink and pretty watered down. And I wasn't impressed by the taste. But you get to take the nice golf bag cup home that lights up... So that's a plus. I also ordered the Kentucky Caramel coffee which is Jim Beam, Kahlúa, caramel sauce, coffee, with whipped cream and 2 donut holes on top. It was underwhelming, but drinkable. The donut holes are really good though.

We went to our bay (which they put both halves of our party side by side b/c there is a 6 person max per bay). The game was super fun even though I wasn't good at it and if you don't have 6 people in your party... I will say that the price is kind of high especially at night. 

I ordered the chili with a side of french fries. The chili was a little bit on the greasy side but it had good flavor. The cornbread that was given on top of the chili had jalapeños and cheese in it, so it had good potential but the only issue was that it wasn't fully cooked. The fries were a disappointment. I would suggest eating before you come to top golf to avoid disappointment. But it was an overall good time."}
{"text":"Minus the long lines to get in we had a great time and would highly recommend.  Just don't get the chicken and waffles.  Frozen chicken as in like the kind you serve to your kids out of the freezer.  Too bad since it was almost $10.  We will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times and always have a good time. Kassey was a great server and played along with our shenanigans. I will say I end up spending more than I want, but you  can't argue with having a good time."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! They've taken a driving range and turned it into a game that anyone with any skill level can play! It's a little pricey at night but hey, it's a destination place with high tech gadgetry so what do you expect?

Personal tip - go early in the day (before noon) and the bay rates are half price. Of course you loose the \"glow bowling\" lighting effects on the range but you still get the fun of the game."}
{"text":"A very entertaining place to get your golf swing on. It's a lot of fun even if you don't play regularly or seriously. It is a must-stop place every time I come to Arizona. Staff is awesome and encouraging. They also don't push you to buy more, or upgrade, or seek lessons. That's something any consumer can appreciate. You need to be careful about avoiding peak hours - not only do they get VERY busy, but the price to play can jump up a lot. It's $25 per hour in the mornings, but $50 per hour in the evenings. I think I'll stick to my morning golf routine :)"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 3 because of how Pricey it is with everything that went wrong. 
We checked in and the wait was understandable.
However we got walked to our area and it still wasn't clean. The people hadn't even left yet.
Then after the nice host walked us through our safety instructions. 
We were 4 shots into it and the computer froze! Wtf
It's no wonder this place is so pricey. It takes forever for every step. 
Cool as shit place and nice employees but zero communication between them to make guest feel it's worth $60 bucks an hour!! 
Top golf better get \"on top\" of things fast. 
Vegas local"}
{"text":"Great for all ages (kids or adults).  Great for golfers or non-golfers.  A fun spot to go with a group of people on a night out.  I have been to Topgolf on numerous occasions and always have a fun time.  On the weekends there tends to be a wait, but it is well worth the wait.  They have a really fun menu to that is served while you play."}
{"text":"Vegas generally sucks for service. This is a clear exception of this phenomenon. I love this place- I don't even like golf and I want to celebrate every birthday of the rest of my life here. Angelica, Andrea, and and Andie were all starssssss. Thank you guys- good sh*t, will be back next year!"}
{"text":"One can literally spend an entire day at Top Golf and not know where the day went. This place has everything you can ask for in an entertainment establishment. Great music, good food, full-service bar, big-screen TVs with sports playing on every TV, a swimming pool and golf! This place is a guy's paradise, but can be easily enjoyed by women. This is like a bowling alley on anabolic steroids! 
We came on a Sunday evening for a friend's birthday and put our name in to hit some golf balls. Took about 30 mins to find us a table. During our wait, we decided to take a dip in their pool and order drinks poolside! So dope!
Once you get your table, you get a server who'll bring you drinks and food.They have a variety of games for everyone to enjoy once your at your table. I recommend the \"scramble. 
If i had to pick nits, it would be the pricing. It's about $75/hour and you'll have so much fun, it's easy to forget about the time. Our party of eight rang up a $400 tab, but everyone was able to hit some balls and get a full belly and nice buzz. This would be the perfect place to host a fantasy football draft or just spend football sundays. In fact, it's a perfect place to arch any major sporting event. We'll definitely recommend Top Golf to our friends and undoubtedly return to hit some balls! FOOOOUR Stars!!"}
{"text":"Great place to take the kids or a nice night out with friends. .. Service is great and so friendly. . We were on the second floor. Our section had its own couch and table... Will definitely be back.. They also play great music, but extremely loud inside. It's hard to have a conversation in the bar area."}
{"text":"In Phoenix with my brothers. One of them had back surgery the day prior. We wanted to get out of the hotel and find something to do and being guys who love golfing it was a no brainer. First time at top golf. Signed in, asked for a bay with a couch so my brother who had surgery could be comfortable while we played. Alex came over set everything up for us, was very patient, friendly and was always around when we need him. He even kept the ice packs my brother needed for his back in a freezer and switched them out as needed. We started with one hour and we were hooked immediately. Before we knew it we had been there for 3.5 hours. The environment, the food and beer were all great. They have found a way to make a driving range fun not just for golfers but for anyone! From now on I am going to be planning more vacations in cities with top golf!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here for dinner, I end up waiting literally 20+ minutes for a waiter/waitress to come over so I can order food. They're all just standing around chatting with each other. Worst. Service. Ever. I'm appalled by how bad it is here."}
{"text":"There is a recurring theme with the service at Topgolf, in that there seems to be a lot of waiting for it. We, like many others, were given a 2 and a half hour wait for a bay to play. No problem, we will just hit the restaurant. 

It took the waitress 15 minutes to acknowledge us, another 15 to get the drinks (minus what we had ordered from the bar a that took 10 minutes on top of that!). 40 minutes to get a beer. 

They need real change to the personnel and work flow if they will be successful beyond the first visit hype around the grand opening. 

And the wings were gross and undercooked, but no one even asked us how they were. 

Good luck, hope your experience is better than mine!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience, very nice choice to spend an evening. We tried just 1 st level, but next night it's going to be some upper 2/3...."}
{"text":"This is definitely on my \"wish we had in STL\" list. Came here to start a guys golf weekend though a little pricier than I expected ($90/hr after 7 pm on Fri), this is Vegas. On a Friday night this place was hopping. We had to wait about 40 minutes for a bay but that was easily passed with watching hockey, dining on chicken wings and drinking beer! The food was actually very good. Although the price was a little on the high-end for pub food. I would recommend the chicken wings. We also tried the crispy rock shrimp which was crispy with an Asian flare. Actually pretty good. 

This place is huge. I predict around 100 bays on different floors. Top floors are more expensive. You rent the bay by the hour similar to a bowling alley. We initially decided to bring our own golf clubs but quickly discovered that the mats were best utilized with topgolf provided clubs. 

There are multiple different games you can play. In essence the goal is to hit each target in order to gain the most points.  You don't need to know how to play golf to have a good time or do well.

Rumor has it that they are opening a top golf in St Louis. I cannot wait for it to open up!  You will likely find me and my friends there on any given night."}
{"text":"25 minuets to check in and a $5 individual card that each person must buy?? We did have fun as a family and that the only reason I didn't give it 1 star. Beers on tap upstairs and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Went there today and there was no parking. Sign in the lot said go to MGM. Sorry Topgolf I am not paying for parking. Really enjoyed myself last time, but as a local, I refuse to play for parking. Good luck convincing the locals to make MGM richer."}
{"text":"Sunday night 930pm, Memorial holiday weekend, 108+ stalls, all taken. Damn!! I love Topgolf's concept, the first time I tried Topgolf was in Virginia in 2010! Loved it!! Vegas is different though.

Fast forward to this past long weekend in Vegas. I had no time to play a full round of 18 with my Vegas buddy, so I decided to take my golf clubs anyways to check out Topgolf Vegas (just opened last week). 1st floor is the cheapest rate, as you go higher, the rates per hour goes up. They have 4 floors but the 4th floor has a pool and is only  used for private groups and parties. You also wait longer as you go higher up the floor. We waited about 30 minutes, Sunday night for the 1st floor. 

I love the concept but it's NOT cheap and will put a nice dent in your wallet. However, if you go with a party of 10 versus a party of 2, you can split the cost amongst your friends. They charge you by the time you spend in the stall. Our bill for my buddy and I with alcohol and 1.5 hours of play was about $140. Ouch. I highly recommend you go with a bigger group. 

As a golfer, you don't really need your own golf clubs (my buddy and I brought our own clubs). Clubs are free to use there for each stall. Waiter service...our waitress Alexis from the Bronx was amazinggggg! She was super attentive and stopped by and chatted with us and her other stalls tons of times. She was well versed in the Topgolf games and recommended what she liked and knew how to run those darn computers for us! A+ Alexis...if you or a Topgolf manager reads this kudos to you! 

Liked the concept, didn't like the wait times (even with stalls open). Pretty expensive unless you bring a bigger group to split the cost. Thanks to Alexis and the two Asian girls from LA in stall 103 Sunday night for entertaining us this past Sunday night! Great times in Vegas! :))"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday definitely wasn't disappointed nice family friendly fun for the whole family we all had a blast skyrocketing balls off of the second floor top golf Las Vegas. The beer that I had was not to help see you it was not too strong it was perfect the Ennis and gone OK aged beer. I also have the opportunity to enjoy a pork belly burger it had peanut butter and jelly on it but interesting combination I will definitely be coming back for more ."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch when my parents came into town and it was the perfect place! Friendly staff there to welcome us and explain how it all worked. The food was delicious and the driving range was super fun with all the games. I had never golfed before so this was a great introduction. Hey had an awesome Bloody Mary bar and wide selection of other drinks. We had the breakfast sliders and eggs Benedict, along with the sweet potato tater tots and hash. It was all delicious and the perfect fun atmosphere for us all to have a great time and catch up."}
{"text":"Great concept and it was fun but it could have been more fun if any of the games had been explained to us and if the touch screen had worked properly. We will still return, hope the touch screen works properly (bay host said it was finicky) and ask our bay host about the different games."}
{"text":"Disappointing. We have come here several times and whatever wait they quote you, add 30-45 minutes on and that is when you will get a bay.

Service in the bar was spotty, one guest at our table got his chicken sandwich right away while the rest of the table waited 20 minutes for their food. Drinks would arrive in waves because \"no one could find our table\" in the bar and server would have to bring them. They also ran out of bloody mary mix at 3 pm on a Saturday.  

Bays are dirty and are not cleaned, other than the tables, in between guests.

They also allow valet service to take up 1/3rd of their lot so if you come past 6 pm on the weekend, be prepared to pay $5 to park"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Topgolf, for a friend's 21st birthday. We didn't make a reservation, but as it was a Tuesday night they weren't very busy and got us a spot right away. There were eight of us and we all went in one space. Only six can golf at once but there was plenty of room for all of us and we all took turns golfing anyway. 

I'm not a good golfer but I had an awesome time anyway! The automatic ball dispenser is just so easy, and there are so many holes to hit that even I, with my lack of hand-eye coordination, was able to score enough points to feel accomplished. 

The staff was wonderful and helpful. They really made my friend feel special for her birthday and were incredibly accommodating and friendly. 

We also got a lot of food and drinks. I was less impressed with the food than I thought I'd be. The prosciutto-artichoke flatbread was amazing though! The nachos were alright, and pretty small for sharing. The drinks were a little inconsistent but still good. 

Overall, I had an awesome first time here. The staff really elevated the experience and the view is incredible! When it gets dark the holes light up and the Talking Stick Resort glows in the background. I would absolutely come back, great for any occasion!"}
{"text":"After we ordered it took 45 minutes to get our food.  Never had an establishment take my card first before I ordered my food.  Wait staff got tables mixed up.  I understand they just opened so I will go back in a couple months.  I would have to assume their staff will be on point."}
{"text":"I love this top golf. My company got to experience the platinum experience tonight! Brad, Abby and Ross made this an exceptional experience. We are a luxury car dealership in north Phoenix and we were discussing tonight how it's worth passing the other location to come out here. The environment for company meetings, holiday parties and celebrations just makes sense in Gilbert. It's the right type of busy to be fun but doesn't feel like there's too many people here. My team had a blast tonight and you made me look like a hero for getting this booked in my bosses eyes. If you're considering Membership I highly recommend Gilbert."}
{"text":"Don't order red wine!!! They don't keep the wine well so lots of it are spoiled. I ordered 5 glasses, 3 of which had to be sent back because of spoilage. 

Speaking of spoil...the waitress dropped her tray of drinks on my bf. The manager did give him a new TG t-shirt to wear out. 

Other than the 2 issues, the experience was good. Nice facility, very crowded, very hot."}
{"text":"To any Veteran stay away from this place at all costs!! They don't support us in any way whatsoever!! To them we're to \"intimidating\". Go to the one in Scottsdale if you'd like an enjoyable time. These managers should be ashamed of themselves!!!"}
{"text":"Our second TopGolf facility we've visited. The other one being in Las Vegas. This was the first time I decided to take my clubs to TopGolf and not use their Callaway clubs at each bay. Well, be prepared to have your golf bag inspected by a staff member. You cannot take your driver, fairway woods, or hybrid irons into their facility. Only irons & wedges. I was shocked to find a 30-45 minute wait on a Thursday around 1pm! After all, it was Christmas/Winter break for all the kiddos. The backdrop isn't as pretty as the TopGolf Vegas with the Linq Ferris Wheel in and the Vegas Casino buildings on the strip in the background, or the swimming pools like Vegas but remember, you're in Arizona!!! Other than that, the same quality, service, food, and style can be appreciated here. From what we were told, Gilbert's TopGolf location is a little less crowded and busy than their sister facility in Scottsdale. I guess if you're going during their busy times, Gilbert would be preferred. Other than that, not much to dislike. The kids, novice players, moms, high schoolers, first timers, etc. should all like TopGolf! My 14-yr old son tried it for the 1st time and absolutely LOVED it! I think he's now hooked on golf, and I only took him here to try it out. Now if they could just open one up in San Diego, that would be great!"}
{"text":"Topgolf is a a cool activity destination to hit up with a small group that enjoys golf.  I have been to Topgolf a couple of times now and enjoyed myself, but I just can't see the value in paying $45/hour for this activity especially when you add in overpriced food and drinks.  And you also need to pay $5 per person to \"sign up\" on your initial visit to Topgolf.

The machines are slow to switch between players and even slower at providing you with your next golf ball to hit... so even if you are hitting balls non-stop (which no one would or could do), you still would not be able to hit more than maybe 120 balls in an hour.  And most groups are going to waste additional time eating, talking, drinking, and just not focusing on hitting balls as fast as possible.  

When your time is up, then you are asked to move out of that area within minutes, regardless of whether you still are finishing up your food and drink.  Mind you, this last visit happened to be on a Tuesday and we experienced this again.

With the prices of the food and drink, it's a fairly expensive \"meal\" where you get to hit a few golf balls. 

I will most likely visit this or other locations again periodically, but the true enjoyment of going to Topgolf is in socializing with the people in your group.

***3 STARS***"}
{"text":"I went into top golf tonight with a few of my friends. After we got to our bay, we all ordered drinks. Our server, Claire, told us we each had to provide a debit or credit card to hold our tab. A couple of my friends asked if they could just immediately pay cash since they were unsure about giving her a card. She told us that they could not do that and that it was policy to hold a card for each person ordering. A little bit later, she came back and set a stack of cards on the table, not verifying with everyone who's card was who's. All of my friends got their cards back, but mine was not in the stack. I asked her later when she brought my tab if she could give me my card back, and she immediately replied that she already gave me my card. I told her mine was not in the stack and she did not give me mine. She instantly copped and attitude with me and told me once she puts the cards on the table it isn't her responsibility anymore. Then later tried to say that she specifically handed all our cards to us and remembers handing my card to me. After my friends chimed in and told her that she didn't hand anyone's card to them and that mine was not in the pile, she said she would go check and have a manager come by. The manager also tried to divert the blame from the situation and said that the server checked her stuff and doesn't have my card so it probably blew away. Even though everyone else immediately picked up their cards after they were brought to the table. Really what most likely happened is she dropped my card off at another table since she wasn't verifying names on the cards. The manager then didn't comp my bill or take any money off from our golfing, so I had to have one of my friends pay my portion. I then had to cancel my card and pay for a new one to be sent to my house. I cannot believe how unprofessionally this situation was dealt with. If they are going to have a policy like this, they should have a more effective system."}
{"text":"Top golf here tonight was a horrible  experience !!!! I will never come back again! First of all we ordered food my chicken was raw and when I asked about it they kind of shrugged it off like \"oops that sucks \" then our game kept constantly glitching so they made us move tables then at that table it continued to glitch . We had the glitch reset multiple times after the 4th glitch ( when we were an intense game btw) we asked for a manager for the second time that night ... she decided to sit there and wait for the glitch to happen again and once it did same dang attitude of \" oops that sucks \" this whole place had a whatever kind of attitude .... she paid for my raw chicken although no sorta about that and gave us 1 hour free golf butttt we paid for 2 hours and all 2 hours that system glitched . So overall this place has a crappy dosent care attitude : we don't care u had raw chicken we don't care u had a crappy 3 hours of glitched golf ... hello salmonella poisoning! #placesucksgolfballs"}
{"text":"Writing this review strictly as a non-golfer- never held a club in my life and came here to check it out to see how is/isn't family friendly this place is and to grab a drink. 
 First- you don't have to like golf to love this venue. It's absolutely beautiful, multiple bars, pools, tons of seating and places to lounge. You can spend an evening there just people watching and enjoying the views. 
 I parked myself at the bar on the fourth level and enjoyed the breeze and surroundings. 
 Drink and food prices are consistent with any other gastropub, and considering you are practically mid strip- not bad at all. 
 No, there's no parking. Either Uber/Lyft it or valet, it's not that serious. 
 Now as far as being family friendly- I won't be bringing kids by anytime soon, even though there are spots kids are allowed. The crowd is largely mid 20-early 30 and atmosphere is pretty testosterone charged, and abundance of silicone enhanced view is not all that PG 13. 
 If you are a large party with a few kids sprinkled in, you'll be fine, however. 
 I definitely recommend this spot as a cool new hangout, golfer or not."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best places to chill in vegas besides your typical hotel pool. We went to this place because a friend recommended we watch the game here and it was one of the best decisions we made. Came here on a Tuesday afternoon and the customer service was on point, the food was great, the pool was great, and the overall experience was amazing. Everyone was helpful and professional and very attentive to the patrons. I love the fact that I did not see one employee on their phone and they cater to their customers. Wish they open a top golf in Los Angeles with the same high standards as this one. We will be returning on our next visit to vegas."}
{"text":"Had my 3rd visit in last 3 months as a part of a group event this time.  The previous  2 times were for work related functions but not a formal event.

Each time it is the same thing... the kiosks at each bay are excruciatingly slow  and often make errors.  Then, you stand there waiting for the 0 to change to the correct score and the \"meter\" keeps running.

Top Golf is like being in a cab in a busy city with lots of lights that are red.

The seating is awkward - unless you get one of the couch bays.  The rectangular tables might be better served if they were turned 90 degrees.

As to the food, it's average pub food.  The wings which we ordered each of the first 2 visits, came out mushy and just seemed undercooked.

The brisket - which was served at the event - was the fattiest brisket I have ever had.  

And to boot, the place is really expensive when you add everything up.

On a positive, good beer selection, and the wait staff is mostly friendly.  The folks at the front desk area could use a lesson in warmth."}
{"text":"A word of advice. If you are going to put old bald headed men in a golf cart to threaten people like the idiot Joel, then you all should probably make sure they know the law. My husband and I came for an event and parking was packed. We pulled up along the west wall (don't be upset that we thought outside the box) that had no signs stating no parking, no painted no parking zones labeled, or red lines. Joel pulled up and told us we could not park there. My husband stated there were no notices advising that it was a no parking zone (again businesses that know how to do business have this). Joel then proceeds to say he didn't need to have signs and there are parking spots with lines and he would have us towed with one quick phone call. 

First off you can't tow a vehicle that is not in a red zone and if you have no notices saying it is a no park zone. Even with notices vehicles have 24 hours to move (this is the warning stuck to the vehicle by the business or third party towing company). So while Joel thought he was threatening us all he did was make himself look stupid. Tell him to read LVMC 11.24.010 through 030

If Top Golf doesn't want vehicles to park in certain areas then it would be smart to post notices and not have old bald men riding around attempting to threaten people. I know Top Golf will probably not care about how we were treated by Joel. After all we were just one of the many people that were there right? Our money and our patronage doesn't matter right? I will never refer Top Golf to people I know or my hotel guest that ask me where to go. Get your ducks in a row first before sending out \"security\" to speak on things they don't know. Take some time to train your team especially Joel."}
{"text":"Was really quite surprised by this place.  I attended a company team building event here and had a much better time than I expected.  

In typical Las Vegas fashion, this place is pricey but not outrageous.   The venue is laid out well with plenty do do for everyone.  Shuffleboard, cornhole, drinking, trash talk golfing, waitresses that are easy on the eyes, and just an all around good time.  

The view of MGM is awesome.  The glass walked pool is very cool.  The entire complex just has a great vibe.    Highly recommend this place for just a good time."}
{"text":"In the last couple months I've made my back to Top Golf a few times. Best time of the year to visit would be Spring and Fall. Summer is still a great time to visit if you don't mind the heat. I suggest night golfing if you want to avoid the sun. There's 3 levels of golf, a pool area during the day, and gaming. The main floor has two huge TV's. We loved it for a place to go watch sports and lounge. It's can be a friendly spot for families as well! This venue is a great spot-unfortunately, the service isn't what I hoped. Otherwise, i would give Top Golf a 5 Star review."}
{"text":"Excellent. Here for some drinks and team building. Mainly drinks.  Then Hank showed up.   We was already drunk.  Instantly started hitting on every woman he saw.  The he yelled, \"check this out!  I'm going to see how many golfballs I can shove in my mouth!\"  It was 7.  He shoved 7golfballs in his big mouth."}
{"text":"Five stars for this place. As golfers we love to hit as many courses as we can when we travel. This was a quick turn around but we found time to come here. 
The staff is friendly. Very helpful in explaining the levels and prices. We checked in and had some time to wait before we could start so we went to eat breakfast. We had checked their Web site amd Yelp in advance and the chiliquilles looked great and they were. They were full of flavor and the salsa was spicy just how I like it. The pork was scarce but it was enough protien with the egg. We shared and it was enough for two with a delicious fresh bowl of fruit on the side. The Bloody Mary was fabulous and I do know my Bloody Mary drinks. 
Golf was fun. It is a good way to test your accuracy. We had a treat time and next time we will spend more time there. 
The bathrooms were super clean, always a plus. 

We will be back in June and hope to bring some family and friends."}
{"text":"What I like:

1. A covered place to tee off. Bi-level.
2. Full selection of clubs for men and ladies if you don't have your own.
3. Club like vibe with other games besides golf like cornhole.
4. Live music! Inside the bar area.
5. The gamification aspect makes it way more interesting than just swinging around a club.

What I dislike:

1. Really mediocre bar food. I'm a foodie so it's hard to impress me. Did enjoy the lobster roll.
2. Restrooms are hard to find. Like where are the signs?!?!
3. The heat makes the computer system 'jam up'. It could take forever to finish a game. Super annoying! Like get a blast of cool air on that CPU, m-kay?

I hear we are getting a Top Golf in my area (Indianapolis) soon. Perfect for date night!"}
{"text":"WATCH YOUR BELONGINGS! BAD EXPERIENCE WITH STAFF WALKING OFF WITH OUR STUFF! We had a bday party for a friend. Staff was great helping us get set up.  We gave our friend a golf putter as a gift that he had set by the table.  This was a limited edition piece that definitely stood out from what Topgolf has.  It suddenly went missing, after looking everywhere we asked to see a manager.  When he came over we told him since we were in a corner it wasn't as if someone had walked by and taken it; there had only been staff where it had been placed.  The manager became very defensive saying we shouldn't be blaming his staff and he would look at the security camera.  A few minutes later a staff member came over with the putter saying it was in Lost and Found.  Really? So they took it from us and put it in Lost and Found and didn't make sure it wasn't someone's? Very unlikely story.  Also the manager never came back to apologize or anything.  On top of it while we were looking for the putter the wait staff cleared our drinks that we weren't finished with so we had to purchase more."}
{"text":"Such an amazing place to go and have a great time with family and friends! The past two times my family and I have come here we have ran into Michelle and she is always such a great help when we are getting to our bay! She always insures that we are all set up and ready to have a good time!"}
{"text":"TopGolf is a great place for a social gathering with your friends, family, or coworkers. 

The concept of TopGolf is pretty cool and definitely fun for all level golfers. You get points for the different shots that you make and you compete against the people with you. I don't even go to the driving range too often and it was still very entertaining. 

There are 3 floors that you can play on. We were on the first floor and while you play, there is music and tv's that keep you entertained while you are waiting for your turn.

I went with some guys from my office and we played for 2 hours. We all had a great time and competed against each other for bragging rights. It's a great place to relax, hit some golf balls, drink some beer, and eat some good food.

We ordered the chips and guacamole, the flatbread pizza, the buffalo chicken rolls, and the chicken quesadillas. Overall the food was very good. Not to mention they have a good beer selection on tap and bottles.

They also have pool tables and shuffle board inside if you want to hang out and drink after your game is over. 

Unfortunately I am only visiting Scottsdale, so I won't be able to return for a bit, but if I'm back in town, I will definitely come back.

If you're looking for a place to hang out and have fun with friends or have a birthday party/ celebratory get together, TopGolf is a great place for that."}
{"text":"This was Pretty cool idea by the best-man of a groom to be. We headed out here for a pre-wedding-castration-male-bonding experience and were not let down. With the dry desert heat that dried to beat down our manhood, we were well equipped with the never-ending adult beverages that quenched our thirsts as we struck golf balls into the air. Staff was respectable, funny and always  there to make sure we were properly serviced. This is a well maintained establishment that I will be surely returning to. Kudos to the brilliant management. Cheers!"}
{"text":"So, I don't play golf but you don't really need to know how to if you come to TopGolf. It would help, though, if someone in your party knows how to play so you can get pointers.  We came here on a Sunday at 10:00am and got a 2nd floor bay for our party of four.  My boyfriend knows how to play golf and so do our friends, so I got a mini-tutorial on how to swing the clubs enough to enjoy myself.  
This is a unique entertainment venue with four floors of hitting bays that are climate-controlled so you won't sweat to death in the summer time.  There seemed to be a bar everywhere we looked, plus two swimming pools, and an area where you can watch sports on huge screens.  Our bay had two comfortable couches to sit upon as well as our own TV screen and another one that kept track of our golf game.  The staff was very friendly and very attentive the entire time.  We had a glitch with our game at the start where it wasn't registering one of the players' scores so an IT guy came and fixed it and we were comped for the time that was lost.  The food was enjoyable, too, with shared orders of tater tots and the Injectable Donut Holes (of course).  I also had the Ketel One Mule and it was a really good Mule.  The others in our party had more food, but I can't speak to their dishes other than the fact that they ate them all up.  
I was definitely wowed by this place and I can't wait to bring my dad, who is also a golf player.  Even though you may not play golf, you can still come here to hang out, have a drink and a bite, watch some games on the screens, and just chill."}
{"text":"Man oh man this place was fun even though I sucked!  Came here for my friends birthday and it was amazing.  We got there and they said it will be a 30 minute wait... It was more like a 5 minute wait.  We sat at the bar for a little bit and the bartenders were attentive and fun to talk to.  

We were booth 205 and played a basic game.  Its basically darts but playing golf.  Each of the targets (holes) have different point values and you usually swing 5 times then the other player goes.  It does get expensive here so happy hour is probably the best time to go.  We were at $75 an hour when we went and it can get even more expensive.  Our waitress brought my friend these cake balls that you shoot frosting in and holy shit they were amazing.  The drinks were strong and the gold was fun.  There is shuffle board, and corn hole as well.  I heard there is a pool on the 3rd floor and there are huge TVs around the area. 

I'd recommend going here with at least a group of 4 to offset the cost a bit especially if its not durning happy hour.  Be careful of drunk people with golf clubs, and don't fall into the net... :)"}
{"text":"Always wanted to go to topgolf in Arizona for a long time now. Now they just opened one here in Las Vegas. Place really is a good hangout and grabbing a couple drinks kind of place. I went on a Sunday night which was still busy.

The price to play that night was about $60/Hour plus for first time members it's $5/per person. It's broken into about four levels. We played in the first floor Becuase it was only a 10 minute wait. While the rest of the levels was a long wait, or costed about $15 more for 3rd and 4th level. 

Didn't get to try their menu at this time maybe next time when I come back I will. Would definetly bring a group of friends and stay longer than one hour. Becuase it's just wasn't enough playing time. Check this place out and have fun golfing !"}
{"text":"First timer, staff was awesome to work with. Wait staff was perfect.  Family had a great time golfing. Food was really good too. Was nervous that it would be bar food at 9am when we went, pleasantly surprised with the breakfast selection available. Kids had French toast and fruit. Food was excellent. Definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome for the golf portion. The games are fun, and it's a great thing to do with friends who do golf, and those who don't too! However I've been here numerous times now and have had consistently HORRIBLE bar service. Literally we sat at a bar with a group of five for over 20 minutes without so much as an acknowledgement! I had to walk to the other side of the bar to ask for someone to come over, and we still waited over five more minutes for anyone to come over to us. 

Weekends are busy so you might encounter a wait, which is fine. But the hosts don't communicate to you how much time that wait may be. They just simply say \"ok, we will text you when it's ready\". No confirmation that they have the correct phone number and no estimated wait time. Being in customer service for so long, I was very disappointed in this. Communication is key!! 

Bay service is very hit or miss. Food is actually pretty good, I've tried a few things and have always enjoyed it. I've had Mike C. as a bay host twice now, and he has been the best! 

Tournaments are extremely unorganized. It goes back to the communication thing though, apparently their system went down, but they didn't communicate that to anyone, so instead everyone just sat waiting for almost an hour. It ended up being almost 6 hours, which was far longer than anyone expected. They were busy, so maybe the staff just wasn't prepared, but the service was horrible in the bays we were assigned during the tournament. I actually sat in a bay for 45 minutes and not once did a server come to offer drinks or anything, so I ended up just opening a tab at the bar and walking to get my drinks for the rest of the time we were there. 

Overall I think there is a lot of room for improvement. Especially since it is an established business with numerous locations, I think I had higher expectations for them! Hopefully they will work the kinks out, because it really is a fun place to go. It's nice to have something different as an option for entertainment."}
{"text":"Very fun to do it was my first time golfing went with some friends, had good food and drink selection that was reasonably priced for being on the strip. It was fun!"}
{"text":"Went here for a work event and came away impressed. We had 3-4 bays since we were entertaining both employees and customers. They kept the drinks and appetizers flowing pretty well, and there were a few employees helping us non-golfers not look like total fools when whacking the ball (or trying to). 

I admit it took me a few swings not just to get the hang of it, but also to understand what I was aiming for. Maybe I missed the super-obvious instructions but they would benefit from some larger flat-screens or just signage?

And the heaters seemed to only have two settings - Surface of the Sun & Off. Maybe dial that in a bit? 

But I'd definitely host another work event or birthday party here. Definitely concur with the reviews that say Top Golf is to golf as Lucky Strike is to bowling."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends and play golf. Amazing music, food and drinks. Will recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Top Tee 

This place is brand new and it shows.  They literally kiss your \"you-know-what\" with valet parking, greeters who open the door and a personal valet who tends to your every need.  I enjoyed my visit but be advised that their system is not yet set up to recognize your account by phone number which means you need to bring your plastic club card upon checking in."}
{"text":"At first I could have gave this place 5 stars just from the initial WOW factor, it is certainly cool, fun and the facility is well designed and nice and all that but my review dropped rapidly with slow initial service. I went with a group of people from work on a bit of a \"Team Building\" exercise and so we had a booth rented out for the night and so certainly we wanted service and to have a good time and that means we were there to spend some money which of course is the reason they built this place. Now please know I am super forgiving to slow service at a small place that's packed, understaffed and when people are visible trying and efficient but that is not the case here, this place has tons of staff, they are just slow AF. I mean like actually slooooow, like they move really slow, I saw maybe 2 staff out of about 50 that had the body language, speed and attitude of professional high volume F&B people. At the main bar they had 3 bartenders and one was great, the other 2 would barley qualify to be cashiers at Taco Bell. Another example is when we ordered our 2nd round of apps the person brought them out, we had to move the empty baskets on to our seats, she unloaded her tray and started to walk away and I said (nicely) \"oh hey let me hand these too you\" the response from her was just a shrug and the slowest movement possible, in and of itself not a huge deal but just a total miss for a place that was obviously highly planed to be a high volume place offering a fun vibe. Honestly I could give the place 4 stars because overall we had a good experience but they did so well in conceiving and build this place to then staff it with C-Team talent I just could not give 4 stars much less 5. If anyone from this company reads this review I'm telling you you obviously know you have a gold mine and even with everything I said here there was a line out the door for the place but instead of staying longer and spending even more money (and for our group money was no object) we decided just to go elsewhere because the service was so lame, oh yeah and the scotch options were weak, basically a cool place but could really use some high-end options and then guess what, you would make even more money!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for some fun with friends. Friendly customer service however it can get a little busy throughout the day. Locals don't forget to inquire about the local discount!"}
{"text":"Do you like golf? No, well do you like food, sports, or joking around? If so, you are in for a treat! I am bad at golf, but I still had a blast. 

Top golf has many different locations. The Vegas location is brand new and all automatic. They have air conditioned playing \"bays\" like a bowling lane with different games. You use a golf club (they're provided) to swing in front of a button and viola! A ball appears. The games are all different, however the premise is, you want to hit the ball far or into one of the circular sensors. Whoever has the most points wins! You also have a waiter or waitress who can bring you drinks or food. You rent the bay by the hour, so the more people, the cheaper. The lower decks are cheaper and it's cheaper to go in the AM verses the PM. As well as being cheaper during the week compared to the weekend.

Some locations offer kid camps, lessons, etc.  The Vegas location has an awesome lounge/bar area with a huge TV screen for watching games. The food was also surprisingly good. Although pricey when all is said and done, it's a very good time. 

I would not hesitate to play there anytime I had a chance. Don't let being an inexperienced golfer turn you away, most people I witnessed playing were just as bad as me :)"}
{"text":"The experience started out great with Pete N. walking us to our bay and helping us get set up. He was very friendly and knowledgeable about all of the games available. Service was okay, nothing spectacular but just right. And then it came to the end of our time, we decided to not add more as we had other plans. We still had five minutes left and a large group was walked up to our bay and the employee stated loudly \"they have 307 and 308.\" This created a very awkward experience for all involved as we still had time on our game as well as food and drink to finish. The group then just stood there and hovered over us waiting for us to finish. There were at least 8 bays around us empty that were next to each other that they could've been sat at. Our server started to rush us by trying to clear plates that still had food on them and then told us \"there's a reservation waiting for this bay\" like we were unaware. Very uncomfortable and unprofessional situation that was completely avoidable."}
{"text":"Just wanted share that I emailed about the hero's discount and I was really disappointed that some of our CLT's heroes are excluded.  While I agree with giving a discount to everyone who serves the community this does not extend to Nurse Teachers or Doctors who are also heroes in our community and I would hope you would change your policy to add those who also sacrifice so much of themselves to serve the CLT area."}
{"text":"Fun concept.  Not for serious golfers.  You will notice most people look as if they have never swung a golf club before.  Real golfers will get bored after an hour.  Then it is just an overpriced driving range."}
{"text":"Although the price is not the cheapest, the food and service is incredible. Even if you're not good at golf it's a spectacular time and everyone has a blast. 

And the price, although high, it's amazing. 

Recommend."}
{"text":"If I could make sweet sweet love to a location, it would be Topgolf. Combine a cosmic bowling atmosphere with a driving range, and a bar, and what do you have? An erection."}
{"text":"Completely rude staff. I've been there a couple of times before and didn't mind it for friends that liked to have a little fun. The next time I went they told me I'm banned from every location forever for trying to hit a ball over the fence. That's a joke! I get excited when I hit the ball further then 20 feet. My family was here from North Dakota and excited to go check it out. Instead they made me feel like some criminal since I supposedly made my golf ball over the fence. Wouldn't even allow me to sit there while my family to had a good time. I will never recommend any friends or family to go there."}
{"text":"You want to have some fun??? Bowling has tired you out?? Then you need to try top Golf.  This is a fun place to be... I am pretty sure all locations are similar, but I have only been to the one at Talking Sticks out in Scottsdale.  Full bar, good food options and fun - low key golf driving.  This is like darts with golf balls. All ages can play, it is more about fun than accuracy.  We sucked, but we had a good time. They bring food and drinks to your 'lane'.  Good times. Would be great for a date night."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here but wanted to wait a little so it could not me such a madhouse since it just opened. It's crazy big. 1st and 2nd floor is for families and kids with a big area to watch sports and sit down in the middle. I saw a sportsbook but was closed. It be pretty cool to make a sports bet and just sit in the middle area with the big tvs and watch the games. More to do than a sportsbook in a casino. Everyone there was real nice and the drinks weren't too pricy. The 3rd and 4th floor is for 21 and up and the music is louder and also has a pool, pool bar, and cabanas. I'm not even sure if the casino pools have a pool bar from the ones I've been to. We played for almost 2 hours and time does fly when your having fun. We ordered some bass sliders with tots and they were real good. Games are easy to figure out. Only reason I did NOT give 5 stars is their valet area. They really need to figure all that out. I waited about 15 min for my car and people trying to get in were causing traffic on koval since it was backed up. They need the actual thru lane to be a thru lane if people need to get dropped off. Saw a few accidents almost happen. Wouldn't be good. Inside top golf though... It's awesome. I'll be there again next week! Might park at the Mgm though."}
{"text":"Went to TopGolf for a work off-site and this place is unreal! Had SUCH a great time!

The only downside is the parking lot. Seriously, parking is a nightmare! There's SO much space out there in the desert, you'd think they'd be able to buy some property to put in a larger parking lot.

Check this place out, but either get there early, or pay the $6 valet fee - it's worth it when it's a million+ degrees out, 'cause you're gonna be walking!

ProTip - you get a free dessert if it's your birthday! Oh, and make sure you have a reservation!"}
{"text":"This place is a blast!

Good times with friends and family. 

It does get really busy so be ready to deal with that. I have only gone at night time around 7-11 PM and its a good time. Waiters and waitresses were really nice but seemed a bit overworked. 

Be careful because it is too easy to spend a lot of $$ here."}
{"text":"Driving Range + with a little mix of bowling + Full Bar/Restaurant = Topgolf. 

This place place is awesome! Perfect for a corporate team bonding event, or if you just want to unwind over happy hour with some golfing buddies. It's also family-friendly as well.

I must preface this review by saying - I am NOT a golfer. Sure, I've taken a few swings here and there. And I can play a pretty mean game of putt-putt/min-golf, but driving ranges aren't really my jam. That being said, me and my novice crew all had a blast swinging and drinking away while soaking up the glorious Arizona sunset.

Food and drinks were surprisingly top-notch. Our hungry crew noshed on an assortment of small bites, including: queso + chips, pot stickers/dipping sauce; bruschetta; and other gourmet goodies. And i must admit, the drinks weren't too shabby either. I had a few Old Fashioned cocktails and they were well-balanced and strong (perhaps that is why my golf game kept getting better?).
: )

All in all, Topgolf was a great way to finish off our day in Scottsdale. I'd come back here in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Walked in, provided our info and was told it would be a 5 minute wait. An hour later everyone in our party was wondering what's up. Checked in with the front counter, and was told it's a 2 hour wait. Da fuq, how do you confuse 5 minutes and 2 hours?! Well, there's an hour of my life I'll never get back."}
{"text":"Overall it was very fun, however the \"negatives\" we experienced during our time here ended up outweighing the \"positive\". We came on a Saturday night, so expectedly there was a wait. Thankfully we found a little area on the bottom floor away from the bar and DJ (because it was SO LOUD we couldn't even hear each other talk...). Didn't realize we not only had to pay to play, but had to pay JUST TO BE THERE (i.e.- required memberships). Once our entire group got set up, a random name appeared on our list so we deleted it and tried reswiping the membership card of who's name didn't show. The card wasn't set up properly. In order to get things straightened out, it took almost 10 minutes that actually counted AGAINST our paid time... time was never reset. Once we got started, it was very fun. Time went by quick but that happens when it's fun! But then once our time was over, a random guy swooped in within SECONDS of our time expiring to kick us out -- \"do you want to add time? Once I close this out, the booth won't be yours anymore\" ... so we told him we'll close out, he told us to have a good night and we left. Once we were outside, we realized we never actually paid anyone. We went back in and found a manager who acted grateful, until they told us to wait and ushered us into the loud bar area. We seriously had to wait 15 minutes to close our check out and didn't even get an apology from the manager. Nothing. Overall very disappointed with the customer service on all levels. 9-9-17 @ 10pm"}
{"text":"First class establishment. I am not a golfer in the least, and was lucky to drive the ball 100 yards, but there were two targets right there. Heck, I might have gotten decent at aiming straight playing here. 

The drink selection and food are on point, and the service was excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed myself here. I'll definitely be back now that I have that membership."}
{"text":"While the staff is friendly and the food selection looks great, the wait time for service is ridiculous. It's been 30 minutes since we've been seated and no one has taken our order yet or gotten us set up.

Update: staff was very friendly and understanding, and apoplectic. They quickly rectified the situation and took full responsibility. There was a second issue of the waitress not communicating. I had told her I was ordering for everyone in the group and she went to ask for orders from everyone else without telling them I had already ordered for everyone. In the end, the management took responsibility and apologized. Overall, great staff who learns quickly. Fun environment for sure! I would come back"}
{"text":"I really like this place but what a mess. We spent more than 20 mins trying to register and the computer screen wasnt working. They tried to use that time towards our one hour of play time. We had to get manager to fix the time after we complained and asked twice. 

 We bought 2 hours and you are busy! You pay by  the hour but the second your time is up they want you to take food and drinks out of yout bay to another spot. It was not full and there were more 20 bays in our area empty but they were forcing us out of the bay. And making a big deal about it.  Its unfair to not let us finish the stuff we ordered which is already pretty pricey."}
{"text":"I was in last week, just watching my husband play and our service was excellent. I'm sure she is probably one of the best you have. I remember her name because we share the name! It is Michelle. Very sweet and nice lady. She kept us entertained."}
{"text":"Wait time: 45 minutes for a party of 6 on a Wednesday night at 4:30pm. We waited in the lounge and enjoyed drinks and the big screen tv. Not all the bays were full so not sure why the long wait. Maybe it was a staffing issue. 

Concept: As none of us are golfers, we chose to all hit 20 balls each in 5 ball intervals. This took over an hour and we did 2 hours. 

Food: tasty! We ordered the fried shrimp, steak kabobs, marguerita flatbread, tacos, and injectable donuts. 

Service: attentive but weird that we had about 5 different waiters taking care of us in a two hour period. 

Cost: $60 for golf, $200 for food and beers. 

Parking: free parking in their own lot. I screwed up and parked in the MGM self parking and walked forever. Don't do that!

This was fun and a great outing to do with coworkers in a group of 6 as the couch barely fit us all. Would do this again if we ever need some type of group activity."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The first time was a lot of fun with my friends. Our bay attendant was very friendly, and our food and drinks came quickly! The second time I was here was with my family, and it was a bit of a nightmare. We paid for our bay and were told an hour wait. We waited about an hour and fifteen minutes before checking to see how much longer since we never got our text telling us it was time. Turns out we were never put in the queue despite the payment hitting my credit card nearly instantly. They offered to put us at the front of the line for the mix up, but it would be another 30 minutes. We asked for a refund and left because we were so frustrated."}
{"text":"Our 15 min wait turned into an hour before we asked the desk. Said it was a \"system error\" a conventional way of saying they missed us. They were able to walk us right out to a bay though after that."}
{"text":"It's a very fun place to be in vegas if you are out w your friends in summer.  Swimming, golfing, watching sports, eating, and drinking... you dont need to be a golfer to play golf at topgolf, so you can relax and do some swings.  I wore bikinis to the club and it was fun going back and forth swimming golfing."}
{"text":"Usually this place is great, fun times with family and friends, enjoyable golf and food. This time not so much. We made a reservation several hours in advance for a golf bay with a couch and when we got there they had set us up in the only bay completely cast in the sun. We kindly asked to be moved to one of the many adjacent open bays with couches only to be talked back to and given terrible attitude by our waitress Elizabeth. Eventually we were moved to a bay with a high top table in the shade but were continually given sass and attitude by Elizabeth. I recommend Topgolf hire people who are kind and nice."}
{"text":"I've worked at TopGolf in Scottsdale, so naturally when coming to Vegas I wanted to introduce it to all of my friends. This location is definitely next level, so impressive. Our bay hostess was Corinn and she was amazing! Our experience was totally enhanced by her. She totally gets it, and we bonded over our TopGolf experiences of the past. She was attentive, down to earth and helpful. Made the whole day better! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great fun for the whole family, even the non golfer!  Good food, drink and service. Service terrific by all especially Kim, Michelle, Karissa our server and Chloe. Floor manager Michelle even found us to say good-bye. We are out of twiners but already planned our next visit there.  We were there on a Friday night and did not have long waits for table and spot for golfing."}
{"text":"\"Obviously, you're not a golfer\"

That line from The Big Lebowski echoed in my head as we drove to Topgolf, where I was sure my lack of golfing skills would be made apparent for the whole world to see. on the contrary, it turned into one of the most fun group outtings I've ever had thanks to laid-back atmosphere, a top-notch facility and plenty of liquor. 

Our group reserved two sections on the second deck. Walking to our location, I was already impressed by the vastness of the facility, with multiple levels of folks driving their balls off into the horizon and a massive bar inside where people caroused and watched sports. Our section consisted of some comfy furniture, driving greens with a cool laser-operated ball feeder and some handy electronic scoreboards. My game didn't improve much, but I had a blast and our friendly servers kept the green beer (it was St. Patrick's Day) and tasty apps flowing. 

This mixture of low key athleticism, socializing and drinking make Topgolf a perfect spot for a date, a group outting or a solo meditation getaway. I just hope they eventually open a branch in my neck of the woods!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday at noon and had a blast!

Five adults, three who are regular golfers. I was the only one to bring personal clubs, but the clubs provided by TG were just fine.  I did have my driver in my small travel bag (I was unaware of the 'no personal woods rule'), but the bay attendant politely informed me we couldn't use it. No big whoop.   Place was very busy when we arrived, but we only had a 20-min wait for a bay.  Once at the bay, we quickly figured out the computer scheme, and the attendant helped, too.  Never had to ask twice for refills of food and drink.  The best part was everyone in our group had fun with the various golf games!  Our 2hr session was over before we knew it!  We'll return soon!

Cheers!

{"text":"Horrible experience here. I called several times leading up to out get together and I was told there was no way to make a reservation - I had 14 people in my party. This was suppose to be a SURPRISE get together for my boyfriends 35th birthday. He LOVES topgolf- one of the friends in the party agreed to get there at 345 to put our name in. She had never been to topgolf before and no one explained to her the process. She put our name down and requested two bays around 345 and she was quoted 30 minutes. This was perfect because every one was arriving around 4. We waited until 455 to be sat. UNREAL. We went up to the counter several times to check on the status of our group and the girl kept telling us ten more minutes. Absolutely unacceptable - just be honest and quote and hour and 15. We had dinner reservations at 730 25 minutes away and didn't start golfing until 500. When we were sat, we were told to quickly start so that we could receive the $35 an hour rate instead of the $45. Super unpleasant experience. DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU HAVE A LARGE GROUP. It was a nightmare."}
{"text":"We held our annual teacher and staff appreciation banquet at Top Golf (Gilbert) on Saturday, May 13 from 11am-2pm. I was blown away by the hospitality that we received. I was literally greeted on the stairs, walking in, by one of the employees who offered to help me carry the box I was holding. The room was set up exactly how we talked about and looked better than I had envisioned. Melissa Marvel was great to work with from booking the event to the very last minute of our event. Camria was so friendly and checked to see if I needed anything about every 1/2 hour.  The staff was attentive and went out of their way to make sure everyone had a great time. Thank you for making this a wonderful day for my hard working and deserving teachers and staff. Super impressed and very grateful :)"}
{"text":"I would like to update my last 5 star review with another 5 star review! 

We have come here many times since I wrote my initial review and I continue to love it 100%. We have the best time every time we come whether it's with friends from out of town to watch the sunset and grab a drink, to golf, or on industry nights. We were here last night for another industry night and had a great time. 

It's the perfect place. Sit in a cozy, comfy bay, hit balls, eat delicious food, hang with friends, listen to music and relax. There's heaters in each bay so we were warm, toasty and happy. Had great service all night. The place seems really organized and well run. It's like being at a restaurant with a really great patio and you can play the whole time! 

And the food is good too. We tried some different items last night- ordered the crispy rock shrimp which were Amazing. That sauce omg. Also had wings which had a really good flavor. Also ordered the Mushi- only Bc I saw it on another table and immediately had heart eyes. But it was a waste. It's basically a burrrito (filled with mostly rice) cut into 6ths and plated well. None of us liked it and felt like it was worthless. Tasted like a bland burrito/ no sauce from El Pollo Loco. Luckily I dipped it in the sauce from the wings and the shrimp and it was better. But still a waste. Anyway I won't let this stupid burrito affect my love for Top Golf. 

We will be back soon! ESP Bc my husband won the raffle for two free hours of play. See you soon Top Golf."}
{"text":"Well I am very torn with this review because on one hand I absolutely love playing top golf! I have been to both this Gilbert location and the Scottsdale location many times. My problems is with the service at the Top Golf Gilbert. After letting it go a couple times it must be brought to managements attention that the bay hostesses are extremely rude, never friendly, do not say Hi, cant answer questions, and she literally rolled her eyes last night when I asked how long of a wait it was."}
{"text":"Aside from the entertainment from watching work people get really riled up about golf, I didn't think our work event at Top Golf was that great. The food choices for vegetarians were pretty limited and the spread we had for the group wasn't very good. It was also hard to get ahold of a server to get drinks. I did have some fun hitting the ball a few times but since I'm not a club head, I got bored pretty easily and there isn't much else to do here."}
{"text":"It's my first time trying this golf thing. My husband told me how to stand and hit the ball, but that didn't work so well. I got the hang of it towards the end and even had the high score at the end. This place is fun with night golf as well, we did the afternoon and it was really fun with service and lunch from the top golf team. Definitely will be coming back here."}
{"text":"I went to TopGolf yesterday as part of a Team Building event where I work.  It was okay.  I do not normally golf.  Despite that, it was fun enough to shoot a few balls.  I am not a good golfer though."}
{"text":"This was so much fun! Much more than I anticipated. I am not a golfer by any stretch of the imagination and I was a bit wary going in. Fortunately, my bf gave me some pointers and I managed to do well enough to not feel humiliated! 

There are people of all skill levels here just having fun. You rent the bays by the hour and can have up to six people in your group. They supply the clubs, the balls, everything! You can order food and drinks in there as well. If you really don't want to golf there are lots of other things to do. They have billiards, shuffleboard tables, and a giant bar if you just want to sit and have a drink and watch everyone play. This is definitely a spot where anyone can hang out and enjoy themselves."}
{"text":"Topgolf is the place to have fun while hanging out with friends.  Upon arrival on a Saturday night, cars were parked on the side street.  I was fortunate to find a space there when a car pulled out.  After walking around to the front of the building, I saw there was a very long line of patrons waiting to get in.  A staff member who came around to answer questions of the patrons in line mentioned the line was to get a membership card, which is needed to participate.  If you already had a card, you could go ahead and get your name on the waiting list for a pod.  There were three registers open but it was taking a really long time to get individuals registered.  After getting to the front of the line (via friends in our party), our pre-reserved pod was ready.  It happened to be the one right in front of the lobby area.  No big deal as the music was so loud, nothing in the lobby got our attention.  The place was wild.  

There was one staff member, let's call her a guide, who came around to show us how to operate the computer, etc.  She said our waitress would be along shortly.  After a long while, I grabbed her to get the waitress and send her to our table.  Our table should have had six chairs but the pod people next to us took three of them for their party.  I had to convince the guide to get our chairs.  She couldn't do it and had to grab a manager.  He came by and got us three chairs from somewhere.  

Did I mention the music was really loud?  You had to yell at each other to conversate.  We finally got drinks and food.  The food is pretty good and the prices are reasonable.  I thought the price for the play time ($45/hour for the pod) was high but I don't know much about paying to play golf.  It was a lot of fun but I could have done without the really loud music.  Maybe it's not as loud on the higher levels. 

They also have a bar/restaurant area, and a DJ was upstairs playing in front of the dance floor.  If you want to hang out on a weekend night, this is a great place.  If you are serious about hitting golf balls, you definitely want to visit on a weeknight.  It's a great place for kids any day but the weekends are a bit much for the young ones."}
{"text":"Traveled to Arizona for this. We really enjoyed it. The place was clean and really nice. They had a screen with my name on it when we arrived at our bay which I thought was really neat. The customer service was great. Everyone was very attentive and kind. I ordered mango habanero wings and they were AMAZING! I love buffalo wild wings but these wings were on a whole new level!!! Overall an awesome experience & we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Whether you come to play golf, just hang at the bar for a drink and watch the game, or just to eat you can do that here. Don't think you have to come just to play golf. Playing the actual game is really fun (and not just because I'm actually pretty good) but it's just the whole experience especially with the right group of people. There is usually a pretty long wait time so now that you can make reservations online that would be your best bet. But they do charge for the most popular days/ night like Friday & Saturday's, but it's pretty busy during the week as well. The service has been pretty good with not too many complaints. And the food is delicious! I've tried just about everything and my favs are the signature nachos and the grilled backyard wings, the chicken sandwich is also on point! And yes I've been here just to eat before lol. The drinks are good as well but the golfbags could be a little stronger even though you need two people to even order it."}
{"text":"Came here with the family for the first time. It was fun, kind of like a bowling alley but with a driving range. All in all my family and i enjoyed it. Its a great experience."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to a Topgolf facility. We were greeted before entering, and given clear instructions. Every staff person from the membership counter, concierge, and host were extremely friendly and accommodating. We played for 2 1/2 hours and ate fantastic food and drank ice cold beverages. Our waitress was attentive and efficient.  I highly recommend this laid back, fun, relaxing place to all golfers from beginner to pro."}
{"text":"I heard about top golf but never tried since I do not play golf. Top golf isn't boring at all it's like a pool party, club, bowling and golf all together. I said bowling because of the team work and fun. We got a table upstairs had champagne vodka, sea food, pulled pork and sandwiches and deserts it was all yummy. 
They have pool on the roof and tv. Something I never experienced while playing golf.
Totally do it again"}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is awesome! I have been here twice so far and have had a blast every time. It's a little on the expensive side, especially if you order food and drinks...expect to spend at least $70-$100. If you're coming to play just one round of golf with a few people, it's relatively inexpensive but who can come here and not drink? It makes it all the more fun, especially when the servers come right to your bay. haha. 

The golf bays are really comfortable complete with patio couches and tables and heaters in the winter. I recommend getting a bay on the third level if possible...the view is better."}
{"text":"What a great fun place to go to !  The line to obtain a membership was a little long but it moved rather quickly.  I ate downstairs and the service was exceptional.  Our server was attentive and made sure my guest and I were taken care of.  There are poo tables and corn hole (I believe that's the name) and other little areas to just kick back and enjoy the social setting and of course there is the golfing areas as well.  I ordered the Mushi and a bottle of pinot grigio.  The wine was $29 and the mushi was a reasonable price as well. I would suggest going with a group of family/friends or date night! Definitely a go to!!!"}
{"text":"I was thrilled to attend the VIP opening party and have a chance to play at the new Charlotte facility. I am a major fan of TopGolf (having played in other cities), so there are no words for me to explain my excitement for now being in my city. If you're looking for a fun, outdoor activity with friends, this is a great choice. It's great for all weather because you're mostly inside. There is A/C if it's hot out and heat if it's cold. Don't worry about being a good golfer - there are lots of games to choose from. You don't need to hit the ball far to win; just be consistent. 

They also have great food and drinks, so it makes for an awesome brunch, lunch, or dinner. Absolutely in love with this place!"}
{"text":"Fun place for family or friends. Open all hours. Rates go up the later in the day it gets. The top floor is the most fun imo. Have to try the mushi! It's amazing! Fun sports bar area too while waiting for golf. Great Bloody Mary bar on Sunday mornings."}
{"text":"Went after work on Friday with coworkers. ...this is my 3rd time.  Golf is really fun but the service horrible.. .again.  management said it was a new server.. ..the last time they were under staffed.  Check your final tab. ..drinks we did not order showed up on our bill.  This happened twice before too.  Food is average at best.  And we couldn't order 2 buckets of beer to start because \"per AZ law\" we needed 6 in our group and we only had 5.  Please don't quote AZ law before I even sit down!  Of course she was no where to be found for drink orders after that.  My advice. ...pay with cash as you go.. ..or try Gilbert location."}
{"text":"Went here for a bachelor party. The entire place is really amazing, it's the ideal man cave. 

With large TVs, booze, food and golf you can spend n entire day here. 

Only issue was it was a bit over crowded and the staff was a little unorganized."}
{"text":"Update: went again to find out 3.5 hr wait on a Thursday night. They should have wait time on app and website. The parking lot is terrible. 

It's a good place but had issues with first experience. Card didn't work after we loaded money to it. Fan behind us stopped working. The app is not up for Charlotte yet, bummer. Long wait to buy membership card which is required to hit. Take your own clubs if you are a serious golfer. Theirs have very flexible graphite shafts. Wish I brought mine. Food was good. We had fun. Hope they get the kinks worked out."}
{"text":"Not a golfer but I think it's pretty cool to have a pro teach you for free while having a good time. He was so nice and patient with me... I was hitting like a pro."}
{"text":"A little overpriced & Slow food service, but the staff is nice and it is a fun place to go on a weekend with friends."}
{"text":"I came here last night with my family. Super fun place and not as expensive as I thought. We payed $50 and got to play for an hour. You do pay $5 per person to get a membership card but I consider that not to be that bad. I will say playing golf is harder than it looks. Takes a few minutes to even get comfortable with the swing. This place is definitely a fun little thing to do in the night if you want to hang. Good atmosphere and insanely good food in my opinion."}
{"text":"Wow, This place is FUN!! I had no idea... Girls trip none of us are golfers, but we are competitive...we started off one the 1st floor game/tv area where we ordered food, I wish we had eaten there but not a big deal... when we got our golf bay we had 1 hr which is why I wish we ate 1st!! our host quickly showed us how things work...And we were off!! It was incredibly fun the food was  really good, the view of the strip was cool... if you want a good time I recommend checking Topgolf out!!"}
{"text":"Having been to Topgolf at this location over the last few years and had a great time I was initially very disappointed with our visit.  We were told our wait with no reservation would be 45 minutes which wasn't bad but when that turned into an hour n a half we were more than a little disappointed. Each time we went to the front desk we were told only 10 more minutes by the same customer service rep. Finally after the hour and a half we called it quits. I asked to speak to a manager and was referred to the end of the counter where having explained the entire experience I was told she wasn't the manager after all but that our bay was ready.  Our group of 6 was done and just wanted to leave. I again asked for a manager and was introduced to Janelle Reynosa. She was amazing to say the least. I just wanted to speak with her about how the breakdown occurred and that she should be aware of it. Our group was not looking for compensation of any kind and nobody was going away angry just sad we didn't get to have fun with our family at top golf. Janelle was honest about having a special event going on ( which the front desk should have mentioned upon our arrival) she apologized for the confusion and extended wait time (which we would have completely understood had we been advised since we didn't have a prior  reservation).  At any rate she offered 2 hours of complimentary play at a later date of our choosing which was a wonderful gesture.  Top golf is lucky to have employees such as Ms Reynoso she really turned a bad experience into something very positive."}
{"text":"At the Vegas one.  Waited 25 minutes for a leftie club.  Finally had to go break up the group of 5 staff members just chatting to see if we could get help.  The bartender, Adam S at the Birdie Bar is super friendly. Thank goodness.  Staff just sitting around talking.  Very little working. The Manager should walk the floor. I asked to speak to the Manager but no one came.  Overall awful experience.  They should send the trainers and staff schedulers from Scottsdale to help them.  Photo attached of Staff not working."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and am glad I did! I don't normally play golf but was still able to play and enjoy the experience. The game is simple, hit the ball, aim for the targets or back wall, repeat. Before or after a game you can hang out at the bar to watch some sports with some good food. 

The thing that topped off the whole experience was the staff. We had maybe four or five people help us through out the night and each one of them was extremely friendly and professional. Multiple times they went above and beyond with out us even asking. They helped keep the party going and made sure we enjoyed the evening taking care of our every need. Usually before we even knew we needed it! 

I would definitely go again, but the price can add up if you're not careful. Even though more people can help cut the cost a little, I think having 3-4 people is ideal as you get more play time."}
{"text":"We have been to this location before and had a wonderful experience but this time it was sub par.

The lady who walked us to our bay was not friendly. The manner in which she explained our options to pay for the $52 hour and a half were not very clear (apparently you can't just pay the $52 at the bay, you can only pay in assigned increments... so we would have had to pay $60 and then had an $8 credit on our club cards?). It was very confusing and the employee did not understand why we were struggling with the concept. There turned out to be an easy solution, but we had to pretty much drag it out of the person explaining the process to us.

Our server was super slow with waters and drinks. He seemed annoyed we only wanted the one pitcher of beer. When the ball dispenser broke he was in no hurry to find someone from maintenance to help fix it. When we walked out by him he didn't smile, wave, or even acknowledge us.

Our ball dispenser broke twice and we had to wait for maintenance to fix it both times. One time they did credit us with an additional 15 minutes.

Multiple times there were balls that hit targets but no points were registered. These were not identified as practice balls so they should have been working properly.

I have never had ANY of these sorts of issues with my other Top Golf visits (this and the Gilbert location) so I am not sure what was going on but we were not impressed."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our time here.  Be ready for a pretty big line on Saturdays.  It's a popular place because everyone can do it.  I mean, who can't swing a club, drink beer and eat good food?

We got a spot downstairs on the ground floor and it was really exciting.  The guy who set us up helped us through all the options and even gave us a half an hour of time as we waited for the rest of our party to arrive.  

It's a wait to finally join in the fun but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I need to tell you about my Topgolf experience. The greatest server of my whole life, Chloe Johnson, was my bay hostess this past Friday night. She took care of my many drink orders, catered to my request of having a \"trough\" to eat my food out of, and bantered back and forth with me mercilessly with comedic genius. She absolutely made my evening spectacular and I have already found myself back here again the very next day! If there was such a thing as sever of the year award, this girl would be the absolute most deserving of it... Standing ovation! Topgolf, you have a gem on your hands... Give this girl a raise!"}
{"text":"I use to love going here with my friends, and enjoy the food, and the great games they had, and also going to the top floor and just be there to talk to my friends and enjoy the entertainment they had. Now I guess they are starting this new thing where you have to be 21 and older to go to the high floor which I thought was odd, and the guy who checked me clearly didn't know how to check the age limit and gave my friend who was clearly under age a pass to go, and then me I couldn't because I was 20. My friends and I were confused, and that made me just want to leave, I felt uncomfortable. Hopefully this new thing doesn't stick around because I didn't like it. I thought Topgolf was a great family friendly place. Now it just felt like you couldn't do certain things because of your age."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to TooGolf for the first time April 7th-It was so much fun. 
Even if you don't golf,you could go hang out and play corn hole, and other games the bar had.
Theres a long wait time to golf, but if you really don't care about what level your on, go with level 1, the more popular bay's is 2 -4. The bay's are timed so plan to wait about 2hrs, on a weekend.
We had dinner and drinks while we waited, so it worked out perfect.
We were able to play with four people in an hour, and that was more than enough time
Food was good and drinks were good not over priced at all.
I definitely will return next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"This might be the best thing ever invented!  I like golf, I'm certainly no professional.  I can hit it, but not always well.  I also like cocktails, I certainly am a professional.  I can hit them, and always very well.  Did you see what I did there?

Combining the two...my mind was blown.  We went on Sunday 11/13/16 with my mom and her boyfriend, who are scratch golfers (retired people always run the course, ugh) and then me, my BF and his daughter and her BF (both 19 years old).  So there were experts, intermediates, and beginners.  

ALL of us had an excellent time!  It was so much more fun than I expected.  The experience is worth having.  Even if you suck at golf, it will be fun.

You rent a bay, get your table and server and they take care of getting you cocktails and food, and you just...golf.  We aimed for the targets, some of us hit them, some of us hit the side nets, it didn't matter.  It's a great atmosphere to bring people together.  My boss and the rest of the district managers for my company did this in Houston, it's a great team-building venue.  Which can help certain families as well LOL

Drinks were good, I was enjoying Moscow Mules, but everyone was getting freebie Michelob Ultra's (not the 19 year olds, they were our DD's) and we all loved the food...had the edamame, the crispy rock shrimp and the wings...kids got two sunset burgers which looked delish.

We will MOST DEFINITELY be back.  I hear that they are opening a SD location sometime not too far away...I can't wait.  It was seriously so much fun for everyone of all ages, I'd say 18 year olds to 80 year olds would have fun. We  spanned 19 to 67 and a good time was had by all. 

And, my golf game may have improved...maybe.  Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"This place is a ton of fun, but it could get expensive fast.

Holiday weekends are $110/hour of golf and bottle service starts at $250/bottle.

This place could get dangerous after a few drinks in - I've seen players accidentally throw their clubs and I've seen close calls of spectators wandering inside the red line.

They even have optional cabana areas if you wanted to dive into the pool instead of golfing.

They need to fix the parking problem, cars were backed up into the main street blocking traffic.

Good thing we UBER'd there. I'm coming here on every one of my Vegas trips."}
{"text":"What a great night.  I brought a group to Las Vegas from Seattle for a group outing on the 20th.  The faculty was great, drinks were well made and the food was good.  It was a fun way to bring people together that were golfers and those who were not. 

There was also a magician there (Chris I think) who was outstanding.  He did a few tricks for our group that left everyone talking about it.  If you see him make sure to ask to see the trick where the card goes to his pocket. Amazing."}
{"text":"Not quite sure how to rate this. Met a friend of mine here to just check it out and see what the big deal was. As an avid golfer and someone who works in the golf industry, I was curious to see what all the hype was about. 

First off, it wasn't too busy out front for valet on a Friday night at 5pm but I can see how it could be a crazy mess. There were a lot of open bays as well for the golf part, so it wasn't too crowded at this time. Plenty of staff people around, most just patiently waiting for someone to show up. 

I would have to agree with another reviewer, this is probably someplace to go to kill and hour or two and drop a couple hundred bucks. Not sure its more than that, or some kind of lifechanging experience. From a golfer standpoint, I'd rather go to any other driving range and hit a $8 bucket of balls. The holes in the middle are quite large, and with the synthetic grass or carpet, your ball is bound to bounce into one somewhere. On the positive side, they do have Callaway XR irons and woods to play with.

Overall my impression was, not worth what they charge. I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. It was the perfect place to relax after the reception dinner before my friends wedding. Trey really took care of us!! Love you guys."}
{"text":"Best Topgolf experience yet. This place is huge and has so much to do while waiting to get your bay. The pools in the middle of each levels are awesome! We will have to check that out next time in town."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I are locals and I work on the strip as many locals do. My mom who is 60 came in town to visit so we thought Top golf would be fun for all of us. 
We went on a Tuesday around 4pm and stayed for one hour. We were greeted quickly and shown to our bay within about 3minutes. From there we had a host explain the system and all the cool features our bay had. It was a bit chilly outside but there were heaters which made it comfortable. We ordered waters until we could decide what we wanted to munch on they have a great selection of treats. We each took our turns and had a great time playing but I will say we are golf challenged lol I ordered tater tots and some hot tea which arrived promptly. When our time was up the waitress asked if we would like to extend our time and we opted out due to other plans we had made. 
A few hours passed and I realized I forgot my purse which I thought just had my ID and a few other things. We are home when I start rubbing my hands together and find that my engagement ring isnt on my finger. I remembered that after my first few swings i took off my rings and put them in my purse because they were pinching my skin when i would swing the club. When I remembered that happened I called Top golf immediately and spoke to a few different individuals all of them said that nothing was turned in to lost and found.
When we went inside to speak with guest services they directed me to a manager and then we went to look at the bay we were at and nothing. Then she introduced me to the head of security Zach and he explained that he would check surveillance and get back to us. I felt hopeless because in all honesty theres not a lot of time to go looking through surveillance for some ladies purse. We waited in the parking lot and Zach got back to us within 15-20minutes. 
I appreciate the staff not only for there customer service the first time we went in to play but also  when i retuned full of anxiety and nerves they were all so helpful and did everything they could to help me retrieve my belongings and especially my new engagement ring. There are not a lot of businesses on the strip in Vegas that would take the time to do what they did."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on Presidents Day weekend. Holidays (we should have expected) are definitely extremely crowded. We had to wait 2.5 hours to get called to our bay. When we got here, the staff were all kind and helpful, but the people in the bay right next to us were incredibly rude. They screamed at the top of their lungs OBNOXIOUSLY anytime we tried to swing. This went on for the first half hour we were there. We addressed this with our waitress and she brought a manager over promptly. They were kind enough to apologize for the issue and honor a discount on our bill along with waiving our membership fees. We understand that you can't prevent a group of customers from being a-holes and felt that the staff did their best to make best out of a bad situation for us. So a big thank you to our waitress, Imani and the manager, Scott, for helping us out. 5 stars for service, but 4 just for the incredibly long wait times :( if I could give a 4.5 i definitely would! Definitely a must try in Vegas. Also, food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Worst place I have ever been to. Security was non stop lurking and it felt like we had no privacy. Also we told them that this was our first time playing golf and they just left. We had to figure out how to do/work everything by ourself not only that but one of the waiters were scoping out how long we were going to be staying."}
{"text":"I don't know what anyone would have to complain about... This place is awesome! 

The top two floors are 21 and over and have small pools on them. The bottom two floors have no age limit and have fun games out to play. 

They don't take reservations, so you have to wait about an hour for your golf bay. Not to worry, there's so much to do to pass the time, it goes by quickly. All four floors have their own bars, large TV screens everywhere, and either a live band or a DJ. 
The bay's hold up to 10 people, but only 6 people per bay can actually play golf. For $5 you get a lifetime membership card. But then you pay by the hour which is a different price depending on the time of day and the day of the week. 

The uniforms for the staff are really cute plaid shorts, so they are easily recognizable. The security wears red polo shirts. Our bay server, April, found my cell phone and turned it into Buck, who was happy to return it me, when I unlocked it to prove it was mine! Thank you, thank you, thank you! We'll be back every single time we have visitors in from out of town! This is our new go-to place for celebrations!"}
{"text":"I went to a birthday party here a while back.  Great service, and delicious food.  I am not a golfer, but it was still a very fun experience.  It's something you should at least try once."}
{"text":"I signed up online for lifetime member and when got there to start off with hey I'm prepared for this cool new thing, grand opening 2 days ago, they said that doesn't apply for this location. LIKE WHAT.
The workers get you into the bay area, ask if want drinks and gave snobbish chuckles because we don't want alcohol. I get it, it's Vegas, but you don't have to always drink to have fun _it_h.
 It took forever to figure out the screen because workers don't either know themselves or again because we order a water, orange juice, and ice tea. 
All they did was say safety hazards like don't go over the ledge being we are on 3rd floor, like Duh... 

Over-all I like golf so the potential of this place is awesome but service sucked and just felt like a scam. Pay $90/Hour, after waiting 2half hours for a opening. Only to get left in this area figuring out how it all works, meanwhile time is going. More like 30min to hit. I can't even imagine the headache if did have alcohol.


Tip I can give is before you get into stall area, watch others and learn about the screen to switch between players and what games can play because seriously it's simple but if you are new to it, it's confusing. We were taking turns 3 balls or so then switch players VS thinking had to hit 20balls then switch. 
Haha I don't know-  good luck. . Aloha"}
{"text":"I have never actually felt the need to write a yelp review until today. This was my first time at top golf and it was a great time. While we waited to golf we sat in the bar and were waited on by Matt Snyder. He was clearly extremely busy and still managed to provide us with outstanding service as well as great food and drink suggestions. He gave us a great experience and made the wait painless. I would highly recommend this place for a good time."}
{"text":"I come here at least once on every trip to Phoenix and now my lifetime membership card never leaves my wallet.

wait is usually an hour, which means baseball on the xbox kinect downstairs, a few racks of pool, or a beer at the main level bar.

I've taken people who have never golfed more than miniature and they loved it. the scoring, the microchip balls, the gorgeous views, drinks and food (both top notch, usually places like this skimp on the food and drinks since you are effectively trapped for a few hours).

I don't know how anyone can not love this place.

Few tips: if you are with new golfers, aim for an hour and a half to two max. once arms get tired it can get a little messy. also, people love to rent this place out (or a large portion of it), so check ahead of time and go during a time/day during the weekend that is not a charity event or company party."}
{"text":"Came to Topgolf for the first time for a recruitment event.  We had a great time!  From the golfing competition (apparently once someone initiates this part of the game, you get NEGATIVE points for getting your ball in the wrong hole, thanks for telling me guys), to the tasty margaritas, this was a great experience and a very cool alternative to a normal recruitment dinner.  The only thing - I wasn't much of a fan of the food.  We had some standard Mexican fare (tacos, etc.), but after having cheap legitimate Mexican taco-truck food for years, I wasn't too impressed.  I'll have to try the sushi or some other dish next time."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Wish we had one in our state!! Certainly a fun place to hang with family and friends!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time doing top golf, and I had a blast. The golfing part was a ton of fun and the facility is very nice. There low point for me was the food. It wasn't terrible, I was just hoping it would be great. I had the meatball sandwich sliders, mushi, and a beer. The food was just ok. Overall I will def be back, just with lower expectations for the food. Service was good..."}
{"text":"Top Golf = Top Fun!!! We went here on vacation on a day that was kinda chilly for Arizona temperatures & it was so much fun.  We brought a 13 yr old, she has never touched a club in her life, 10 yr old, 8 yr old along with grandparents.  My kids had so much fun & my 13 yr old niece said \"we need one in Minnesota!\" So much fun if your young or old. Great social atmosphere. I highly recommend to all age groups."}
{"text":"To recycle a joke from Pineapple Express (and remove the profanity), TopGolf is like if a driving range and a skeeball game had a kid, and then in a different part of the country a bowling alley and a Dave and Busters had a kid, and then THOSE kids grew up, met, and had a kid - BAM! - Topgolf! Time for another episode of Pros and Cons!

Pro: Options for everyone - there are difficult and easy golf games, all built around on the GPS tracked golf balls and large targets in the ground on the range grass and based on accuracy, distance, direction, etc.  They have clubs of all sizes ready to go, along with shuffleboard, pool, some TVs with sports or Xbox Kinects...

Con: Not that great for kids - a little dangerous if they're on the driving range deck - I can't remember if this one has minigolf (some TopGolfs do)

Pro: Servers take orders for food and drink and bring the food right to your station - pub and sports bar type options, plenty of adult beverages that can even come in pitchers, and super-American options like loaded nachos, Chicken and Waffle sandwiches, and injectable donuts.

Con: Had to go through a pretty extensive sign-up process for a guest pass - took 10-15 minutes - just seems like it's a marketing info grab and they could do without it.

Pro: One of the best times I've had, just a very creative combination of a number of awesome things

Con: Super big missed opportunity? When the cart zips around to collect the balls, all the computers should just say \"HIT THE CART!\" for a few minutes - everyone is thinking it already, and it seems like the GPS could track if you did it or not - just put a couple nets on the cart like sails on a pirate ship.  It would be an epic community event and would look super cool like a mix of \"NYPD! Hit the chopper\" from The Other Guys and the archers from the last battle in Braveheart.

Overall, stellar idea and decent execution"}
{"text":"Service inside the restaurant is awful. Had to bus my own table and it took 45 mins for drinks to end up on the table. The golf is of course fun but you're better off not eating here or waiting to get drinks till you're in a bay."}
{"text":"Came to Topgolf for their March Madness event in 2017.  After searching for a good \"watch party\" in Vegas, I heard of Topgolf, and we decided to try it out.  The set up was pretty great.  It was $50 (plus outrageous ticketmaster service fees) which included 6 beers, a taco platter, and a very large T-shirt.  It was the usual Vegas crew of Mr. Booth, Bloewen, Buxton, and myself.  

Our waitress was great.  Even though she was constantly very confused and fostered a couple awkward conversations, she was very nice, attentive, and provided great service during our time there.  

I do have to say that the tacos were great, but it was very odd that they did not have any tortilla chips.  Buxton couldn't understand why no tortilla chips were offered.  We were told that they have a seven layer dip, but didn't understand how that is eaten without tortilla chips.  Buxton said he would have assumed that it is just eaten with a spoon.

We did have a great time at Topgolf, and I will happily return next year for the March Madness event.  There were quite a few golfers teeing off, but our four-some did not partake.  It seemed a bit overpriced for the driving range, but I guess you are paying for a nice atmosphere.

Thanks for having the MM party, and I hope you guys repeat the same promotion next year!

My only \"compliant\" is that for a few hours the bathroom did not have any soap.  Although this didn't bother Mr. Booth (he doesn't use soap), I found it odd.  I told management and they said they were working on it.  However, it seemed to take hours after they were notified.  I guess the soap store was closed for the day...."}
{"text":"Great place. Fun place for a bachelor party. 
Golf is fun and food and drinks are awesome. Military discount."}
{"text":"Came for brunch. Sunrise burger was on point and the Bloody Mary was also good. Great concept as well as good food."}
{"text":"Arrived here and it took an hour to get seated after they told us a 20 minute wait. We received our text to be seated, but our bay was occupied when we arrived and the table needed to be bused. Another 10 mins later, we finally got seated. Another 15 minutes until an overwhelmed server came to take our orders. Queue another 30 minute wait for our drinks. Food finally came, which was on par with a chuckie cheese, not good, and twice as expensive. This whole time I was asked repeatedly for my ID, membership cards, and credit card, which was seriously annoying after the 10th time. I will stick to my local driving ranges, and advise anyone thinking about going here to lower there expectations dramatically."}
{"text":"Dakota Storm was the man!!!  Very friendly and personable.  Seemed to really care about his job which is exceedingly rare in the service industry!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here with 7 of my friends for a bachelor party.  We got the 3rd floor cabanas with private driving range within close proximity to the pool  Ashley was awesome at helping me plan this all out and our time slot of 3pm - 6pm was perfect, as we had an awesome view of the LINQ ferris wheel and most of the strip from the driving range.  

Food and bottle service/drink prices are actually very reasonable by Vegas standards and our servers (Jasmin and another gal) were awesome to work with.  

Definitely a great place to go to for a huge crowd and I highly recommend the 3rd floor cabana/driving range, as it had a great crowd and a lively mix of people, mostly under 40 (which did surprise me a bit...maybe we came there at a good day?).

All in all, I had a great experience and highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The golf and venue for entertainment is absolutely 5 stars! Great concept and fun to hit balls for any level of player. The food is typical bar food and not the greatest which is the only reason I dropped them down to a 4 star.

I'll definitely be a regular here and do some events for my company here as well."}
{"text":"The scoring is automatic but not accurate. Didn't have much confidence in the assessment of my golf shot but it probably got it right 60% of the time. Not sure about the bar service because I didn't ask for that. Also, the ball release mechanism is a little frustrating since it requires a few waves of the club before it responds. I think 21st century technology can be better."}
{"text":"Finally made it. Food & drink ok but great concept & entertainment venue. Recommended"}
{"text":"I had called three times to make a reservation and no one was able to help me due to their lack of knowledge! Totally ruined my idea for my birthday night. Don't waste your time trying to make a reservation! This place is full of clueless people. One star was given because no star option wasn't available."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of topgolf! I've been coming to this location multiple times over the past year and Everytime I always have a blast with friends. The food is surprisingly good! Don't expect a 5 star restaurant but definitely better than your typical bar food. This is a great place to come for big or small groups to have a great time enjoying food, drinks and golf!"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times now and have had a good time each time.  For a sporting & entertainment venue, the food is surprisingly good!  I've eaten here 2 times now and have been pleasantly surprised by the dishes.  It's not cheap, but fair for being basically on the strip.  Parking is free, and if you are a local, you get 20% off your time (so about $60 for peak times in the evening on the 2nd bay).  If you come in the evening, it can get quite busy.  Both times I've had between 1.5-2 hour waits, but you can leave your name and they will call / text you when it's your turn.  Note if it's your first time to Top Golf, they charge you a $5 membership fee to be in their system.  Each bay allows up to 6 players and 10 people."}
{"text":"Wildly expensive but also wildly fun, Topgolf is kind of addictive! I've come here twice in the last month- once with a group of co-workers for a team building activity and once on a date.

The food on both of my visits was unfortunately not great though. 

The first time I came I ordered the shrimp cocktail and it was honestly disgusting. The shrimp itself was fine but seasoned with (I think) paprika which wasn't a good combination IMO. I choked it down but not enthusiastically. It was served on wonton crisp-like chips with uncooked onion, jalapeno pepper and funky tasting cocktail sauce. I did not enjoy it AT ALL. I dumped all the toppings off and ate the chips by themselves and only because I was starving.

The second time I ordered a quesadilla and it was also noooo bueno. The cheese wasn't fully melted and tasted kind of like a kraft single melted between two tortillas. The peppers on the quesadilla were cold and uncooked.

The guacamole served with the quesadilla was bland and mediocre.

The only thing I enjoyed was the cookie & marshmallow fluff dessert my date and I ordered. It was yummy.

The price for an hour of golf varies depending on what time you come. In the morning it's $25, from 12-5 is $35, and after 5 it's $45 per hour. I came after 5pm both times I visited Topgolf. For a group of five coworkers, $45 is a bargain. BUT for an intimate date with two people, it's a pretty steep price to pay. I think on future visits I will eat before I come and only get drinks & dessert here and I'll likely come in the afternoon rather than the evening.

One thing I have to give them credit for is that they make a major effort to keep you cool in the summer heat. They have numerous huge fans (with misters attached)  blasting every which-way and you definitely will NOT get hot here. Love that!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night and had a great time. We were explained the process, all the staff was super nice, and it was a great setup. Great for all experience levels. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Great place for team building! Had a good time networking with colleagues! Food was decent. Tried their pickled fried chicken, beef brisket, salad and mac and cheese. Only gripe was the sangria was too light. The coach who trained us did a great job teaching the ropes and you could tell he was passionate about the sport. Overall, highly recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"If your gay don't come here the bartenders are so unfriendly. They judge here and make you feel like your worth nothing. Ashely is the worst she doesn't like Hispanics or gays. This place is horrible when it comes to service. Odds are coming back are slim. Sad that people still judge you for being a certain race or simply being you."}
{"text":"If you've ever wanted to go to a driving range but feel like you're in a video game than this place is for you! 

Three levels of driving range with bars on every level so you can have a party no matter where you are. Pool tables foosball tables and tons of TVs everywhere you look!

This place really has it all... A true adult playground."}
{"text":"I will start by saying I cannot golf, unless we can count Goofy golf or Tiger Woods video game from back in the day... The prices are by hour per Bay, regardless of the amount of players in each Bay. The prices increase at each point of the day, morning, afternoon and evening. Anyhow this place has a fresh concept that can make even a non golfer like myself get excited to take a swing. The various game mode have just the right amount of competitiveness that makes the games friendly and social. I even believe there was a team mode. 

Top Golf has several bar areas and an area for live music or DJ. Plus if the kids want to roam, there are other areas for to enjoy, pool tables, etc. The service is very good too, given the amount of bays and people that tend to occupy the place. 

As for the food and drinks, they are both better than expected for a place like this. I would have thought Chucky Cheese but was surprised that is was so much better than I had anticipated. The cheese queso was so good that my son who hates cheese was eating it. Also the donut holes you fill with a trio of sauces were delicious, plus they support the children's hospital. The mixed drinks have good options and are strong. 

All and all a good place for adults to hang out or for the family."}
{"text":"This is the 6th or 7th time we have been to the venue. We love the concept but after waiting 2 hours and finally getting to our bay the service always seems questionable.  I had to search around for my server tonight to find out who they even were. Once they were found she told she me \" I was serving drinks\" no intro no apology just \"what do you want?\"

The beer they brought me was flat and she didn't check back till the end of our round when my friend had already went upstairs to get me a new one. We were never offered waters and paid $50 in an uber to get there. Never again!"}
{"text":"We went to topgolf 9/20/12 for a birthday. There were 12 of us... 
To start when we got to Topgolf we were told to stand in one line. We waited in that line for aprox. 20 mins before getting to the counter. At the counter they were having difficulties with the computer and it took another 20-30 mins to check all of us in. During the check in process I asked a friend of mine to go check on bays for us at the concierge desk.  She was told at the concierge that we could not check in without having everyone's players cards present. (Prior to going to the venue I had purchased to 2 VIP passes so that we could prevent the waits and be moved to the front of the line for bays.) Once we had everyone's players card the concierge then let us check in for bays. They told us that if we wanted the 2nd or 3rd floor that it would still be about an hour or two wait for us even with the VIP passes. So we opted to take the first available. They put us on the first floor in bay 102 and 103. Someone from Topgolf brought us to our bays and showed us how to use the computers. That was extremely helpful... but then we noticed that there were only 5 and 6 clubs in each of the bays. I went up to the front desk and asked that they brought us more clubs and was told someone would be down there right away. That NEVER happened. I went back up to the front desk and requested clubs again and still no one came. The golf itself was fun, but we would not return to this venue. If we want to hit balls, we will go to a regular driving range and save on the headache of the crowd, the lack of organization and be able to use multiple clubs."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here, i golf more then the average golfer and will only go with people that know what they are doing. However Topgolf is for everyone, doesn't matter who I go with it is always a blast for all levels."}
{"text":"Great spot for people who love golf and socializing. Decent food and drinks. Great for big groups of people. Will be back."}
{"text":"So much fun! Try the 3rd level. There's a pool, games, and food, along with driving! Service is consistent, friendly, and efficient-Thanks, Tabatha!!"}
{"text":"So difficult to just check in and get a table.should be easier. Bad set up just to play. So difficult."}
{"text":"I came here during March Madness to play golf and watch basketball (morning). The ambience during March Madness was priceless. I wanted to golf on the upper level (more $ for upper bays). It was booked out until 1pm for a private event. I was told to come back at noon to reserve a spot (which we did). We decided to lounge at the pool until a bay on 3rd floor was ready. We were told 30 min to hour wait at most (one of the first to reserve upper bays). The pool area is insane here. We had fun just lounging in pool watching basketball on the giant TV. The pool staff was down to earth and professional. The bar by pool was awesome. We didn't get a text for our bay until 2 1/2 hrs later. Good thing we were enjoying the pool and basketball. We decided not to golf at that point. The service at the golf reservation left a lot to be desired. 30 minutes and 2 1/2 hours is a big difference when we were one of the first people to reserve. Outside of the upper bay reservation, we had a fun time. The facility here is very cool. There is a shuttle at MGM for drop off and pick up. Guest can walk but it's best to use shuttle service IMO. TopGolf is a fun place to visit while in Vegas. I been to other TopGolf venues, this one is on a different level. The customer service from our bay experience knock this rating down."}
{"text":"Really cool place to hang out with friends. Especially if you're looking for something new and refreshing.  The only con is there is always a really long wait on the weekends, but they have a cool game room with pool tables and other things that makes it better. They have a large bar- quick service. The wine list could use a few more options. 

Once you get to your lane, there are tables where you can order drinks and food. I really likes the Nachos that's loaded with jalapeños chicken and black olives, MAC burger is a must. Their signature mushi roll I think it was called was mediocre, very dry.. Wouldn't recommend it. Our server was very nice and attentive. Over all it was a good experience and nice environment!"}
{"text":"Woo Topgolf!  Finally got to see what everyone was talking about and took my office... yes, I'm the most senior person in the office now, for an outing.

Staff was super-friendly and this was before the Christmas/Holiday season so there were a bunch of businesses doing their holiday parties here the night we chose to go.  It was Wednesday afternoon.... we were coming from Uptown so I-77 traffic during rush hour was horrible, but upon arriving, it was like coming up from an oasis.... I was probably just happy to get out of the car by then.

It was cold, but the bay we were assigned (like all the bays) have heaters that were on timers... the server showed us how to use them (**important tip**) and we were good for the rest of our stay... I even had to shed some layers after we did a little \"speed\" round of hitting.

Menu was pretty extensive and our server kept checking on drinks and food.  I ended up getting the spinach salad (added chicken) and also order appetizers for the booth.  Chips and beer cheese were solid and the wings, though messy, were great as well.

Staff also gave us a run through of how the set-up works and safety about where to stand... I can see where it can get a little crazy with larger parties, but it was a fun outing and I was just happy I could hit the ball."}
{"text":"Great set up. Fun concept. Staff are friendly and helpful. Good for gathering. Not for real golf. On the $$$ side."}
{"text":"Had a great time.  Think bowling except- golf range.  We played upstairs and it was great.  Food was good and drinks.  Seemed temp controlled so vegas heat wasn't a problem.  Plus there's a pool to get in if want to cool down. Recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"I have never swung a golf club in my life but this place was recommend by my brother, so my husband and I checked it out. Walked right in and were seated in little section shortly after. They have a menu and servers constantly checking on you. Even though we had never golfed, we had a blast. You definitely don't need to be a pro to really enjoy this place. Wish we had one closer to home."}
{"text":"If I could rate zero stars I would ! Terrible experience! Came out for a bachelor weekend. Although, we did not make a reservation we were told it would be a 3-4 hour wait. We decided to wait. We arrived at 3pm & still at our table at 8pm, with no bay to golf. We finally decided to leave after being told it would be an additional hour. Spoke to the manager Abigail, and she provided us no assistance. We even asked if they could accommodate for a different day, and they too provided no help. I like the venue, but TERRIBLE customer service!!! Such a shame, since we definitely had high hopes for this place !!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Topgolf, and this was one of the better spaces I'd seen at a Topgolf in a while. I'm very much on the casual side of the golfing spectrum, but it's always a good time to drink some beers and hit golf balls far away. This served as our day activity during a bachelor party weekend, along with watching the evening college football games on the many TVs they had around. They had a lot of the games on, and it was just a marvel to be able to watch so many games during the downtime of not blasting golf balls into the colored targets. 

I would say that the important difference between Topgolf and a regular driving range is that Topgolf stresses precision and accuracy more than sheer distance, which is pretty cool. The technology behind the Topgolf system is pretty impressive, and even if you don't particularly enjoy golf, there's a lot of stuff for you to do. Make sure to get a reservation in advance for weekends. Also, know that it is a bit on the expensive side, and with food and drink, the tab can really add up.

I think the only thing that was sub-par was the service, and it was definitely sub-par. We were constantly asking for drinks, and they got our food orders wrong 3 or 4 times, sending us things we didn't order, and forgetting things we did order. It also just didn't seem like they were trying very hard, and we didn't seem to have a dedicated server, so there was just a lot of confusion. The food was decent, although just a little higher quality than a typical gastropub. 

The facility is top-notch and modern, and it's just a really cool place to hang out and hit some golf balls, but the service has to improve. I'd recommend it if you haven't been before, or if you reaaallly like golf, but for the super casual golfer, it might be worth it to explore other options."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends had a great time. I would recommend this for an evening out."}
{"text":"We were so highly disappointed. We met Tyler the Hospitality Sales Manager on Saturday and explained how we wanted to treat our friends to a round of golf., We explained that Sunday was a work day and our friends had a long drive back to California..  We agreed to pay the $100 an hour instead of $60 to avoid the 1 1/2 wait.. He also agreed he would wave the $250 food & beverage min.  We showed up and was told we would have to wait a 1/2 hour which we agreed to. At 8 pm we had another guy come over with the worst customer service and tell us he will make it $120 an hour and $150 min food and beverage because they are so busy the have people willing to spend $500. With customer service like that and Tyler no where to be found we were appalled at this behavior, we left. Pretty sad that they are all about the money and not at all about their customers.  They are taking adult fun and treating it like a Vegas night club, making you stand in line and /or buy your way in. Gorgeous place, horrible attitudes."}
{"text":"Super friendly and helpful staff.  The whole place is such a great idea and our whole group (of 12) had an amazing time and everyone else around us seemed to be loving it too!

Never felt like I was waiting on the staff for anything, drinks came out quickly and time seemed to fly by while we were there.

I would say it would be nice to have a cut off time for kids so adults can be adults but all in all a super fun time...just wish they had one here in Seattle because I would go with friends and clients all the time!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Made me want to learn how to play golf.  Attentive service and solid menu! I come here all the time and it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"This is such a great place for golfers and non golfers. I saw people coming in with their own clubs, but that was not me. I was here to have fun and to enjoy the food. I know they often have wait times but we went on Labor Day at 6:00 P.M. and were immediately shown to a table. They showed us how to use the system and within minutes Austin was taking our drink order. Drinks and appys were served quickly. The presentation on all of the food is awesome.  We ordered the bacon Mac and cheese spring rolls, the buffalo chicken sliders, quesadillas, and a sunrise burger. Everything was so scrumptious! Many items on the menu are perfect for sharing. One would have to work hard to not have a good time here. At night the music gets turned up a bit and the targets flash to the beat. Perfect for families, although probably not little ones."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of golf nor have I ever played. Put-put has been my golf experience. I truly enjoyed Topgolf! The experience they create from the time you walk in until you leave is so personable. We were escorted every step of the way and our server, Deven, was attentive without being overbearing. There are so many different golf games to choose from and for all experience levels. We played level three to be away from kids. The only thing I would recommend is if they could put privacy screens between each lounge area it would make the experience less of a community event. I would defiantly go again!"}
{"text":"This is the best driving range that I've been too. It is like if a driving range was made like a bowling alley. There is a full bar and they also have food. All of this can be enjoyed at the lounge/bar or it can be delivered to your bay. They have many different play modes for the driving range itself. If you don't feel like golfing or if you are waiting for a spot to open up, there is corn hole or you can just relax at the lounge and watch some sports."}
{"text":"My daughter is one of a few Black female golfers on collegiate level. I thought we would experience racism and disrespect from this place. Thank God I was wrong. We REALLY had a fantastic time. My daughter was very happy with the customer service and the top quality personalities working at Topgolf. I was impressed. Topgolf made my daughter's birthday weekend THAT MUCH BETTER. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I have been to a few Top Golfs and this one is the best!! 

We went on a Saturday so knew it would be busy. We put our name in for a 45 minute wait for the second floor. While we waited, we sat in an awesome open area with tons of sports on. We also got food and drinks pretty quickly while sitting. They also have fun games to play while you wait. 

When we did get our spot, we enjoyed 2 hours of golf and more drinks. The staff was friendly and attentive. The golf was a blast and this is a great activity for anyone, including young families!

They also have a bar area to hang while you wait. Overall, great experience and will be back!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this zero stars for service and customer satisfaction I would. You wait forever for a table, no one help you, it takes 30 mins to get WATERS and the staff act like they are pissed off 24/7. We ordered food, bar drinks and waters and the food came before the drinks....that's how long it took. Pathetic service. We love golf but will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Love this!!!! Brady was our guy and did a fantastic job explaing things to this first timer...I will soooo be back!!!!"}
{"text":"SO MUCH FUN!!   Went with two other couples and having heard the place was typically busy, we went early-6:00 and planned on putting our name in for a bay and then have dinner while we waited.  This worked our perfectly.   We ordered our food and very shortly after we were done eating, we got the text that our bay was ready.  Note that each player needs to buy a $5 dollar players card which is good forever and is how the game play works.  You load the card with money and swipe it in at your booth.  Make sure what line you are in when you enter so you don't end up standing in a line that you didn't need to be in, they have kiosks for the cards.

So, for the food, surprisingly it was really good.  Between the group, we had a pretty good mix of plates on the table and everyone was really happy with their order.  I had the basic cheeseburger- but there was a cobb salad, club sandwich and a few other dishes- all the main dishes ran about $10 ish.  

The wait staff was on top of all our needs the entire time and let me tell you the place was packed!

Game time- we were in a bay on the second floor and had a couch, there are some bays that have tall tables but I think either would be comfortable for a group.  They did have heaters that you control in your bay if needed-we did not. 

 There are several games you can choose to play, all varying around lighted/colored circles out in the range.  You pay per hour and we played two hours.  The price varies depending on the time of day, for us it was $45 per hour for the bay.  Again, outside the waitstaff was always in the ready and drinks, deserts etc  were delivered quickly and with a smile.  It was so pleasant- good job to TopGolf for training and customer service!! 

Before I sign off- one quick tip- order the  injectable donut holes- yep, creme, raspberry and chocolate- fun and yum!"}
{"text":"This ain't yer old-school driving range. Remember back then?  You pay a few bucks, get a bucket of balls and head out to the line with all the other duffers.  You bang your bucket of balls out on the range, trying your best to hit the kid in the cart collecting the balls.  You never really know where your ball went, watching the 50 balls flying out there at the same time could get confusing.

Driving range, meet the 21st century.  It's all computerized.  There are actual targets that score your shots for you.  There's a bar.  There is food.  You are in the shade and on either side of you is a flat-panel playing whatever game is on at the moment.  Can practicing get any better?

You purchase a membership card that allows you to register when you play and track your shots.  There are clubs for all sorts of shots, men, women, left or right available.  Food/drink servers coming by with a menu.  You pay by the hour and as long as you keep swinging, the computer-machine keeps spitting out balls and tracking your performance for you.  Don't worry about it.  Get thirsty? Full drink menu.  Hungry?  Great appetizers.  I tried the Chicken wings three ways, BBQ, Buffalo and Asian Sesame.  Comes with dipping sauce and veggies.  Wings were crispy and tasty.  Next, we had the Chips with Guac and Nacho Cheese Sauce.  Chips were out of a bag, but they kept us supplied.  The Nacho sauce was okay, the Guac was fresh and delicious, the salsa plain and boring.

We golfed for a couple of hours and had a blast.  The building is three levels, all brick and glass, there are free video games if you are waiting for a spot,  and the restrooms are clean.  I'm not a golfer, but I would say Topgolf rocks."}
{"text":"We had SUCH a great time at this top golf location! I haven't been to top golf in years (I used to go to the one in VA) and my friends have recently gone to the one in phoenix; but, this was all our first time at this location and first time at one with a pool - and it was a blast! I contacted Top Golf ahead of time to make a reservation - they don't take plain reservations, but if you're going to book a premium bay with a food&beverage minimum, they will. Our cab driver on the way there made us nervous by telling us that package is a rip off and we should just cancel and wait for a bay, but we were SO glad we did it! 

I spoke with Mike to book our bay ahead of time and he was honest about all of the prices and didn't try to sell me the most expensive option. The only confusing part was that when I called back to book, he asked me what he had quoted me and when we checked in, the lady asked me what I had been quoted - which leads me to believe, they tell different people different prices.

Overall, we had 8 people and one pool bay was plenty. The pool was on one side and the golf targets on the other. We had a $450 food and beverage minimum to meet, but that was pretty easy with 8 of us getting plenty of food and drinks for the four hours we were there. We were committed for 2 hours to the bay and paid extra for every hour after that. Our waitress was wonderful - we had already gone into the third hour and were approaching the fourth and she came to the pool where I was and advised me that no one had hit any golf balls in close to an hour, so to avoid continuing to get charged, we should just move over to the pool area and we could still order food and drinks there if we wanted.

The food was great! We tried the edamame, onion dip, mushi, fries, wings, margherita flatbread, garlic flatbread, and the injectable donut holes. We LOVED the mushi and the donut holes - we got multiples of those dishes throughout our time there.

The drinks were wonderful too - with the money we had to spend, it was a blast getting pitchers of beers, trying different cocktails, and ordering shots.

We had such a blast and I would definitely recommend it if you're celebrating something special or want to guarantee that bay by the pool!"}
{"text":"In town for spring training and my sister and brother in law wanted to bring me here!  I've golfed once and have hit balls a few times.  It was awesome Because you're not worried about running out of balls.  Trey and Riley came around and gave us all a round for our money. All sports games were playing on TV while we waiting for our tee off... Food was good, service was good, level of fun was great!  Good beers on tap! Would definitely recommend to anyone in town looking for fun!"}
{"text":"I hesitated coming here because I thought it would be overly expensive and that I would need to be an experienced player. I was intimidated for no reason! This place is so much fun and great for groups. You can stay here for hours. Really impressed on how easy and comfortable everything was and they have local discounts! The place is clean, free parking (at least in the daytime), food is great and beautiful, comfortable decor. You can have a business meeting or a birthday party here. You don't even have to play golf - You can come for cocktails! I took my first swing of golf here and now I have a whole new respect for the sport. It's definitely tough but it's fun to learn here. Very sad I took so long to come I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Unsatisfying experience? Trying to have great time enjoying my boyfriends birthday and they suggested they would rather not serve us! I was a little loud I will admit, but I was totally coherent and our server was under the influence of other substances.  We decided to leave and asked another co-worker of Austin's if he was under the influence of illegal substances. The co-worker totally threw Austin under the bus and agreed that he was under the influence. I highly recommend another venue if you are looking for a great night."}
{"text":"The most fun environment with over the top customer service and attention to detail.  Well with the fair pricing and the Baller Status that follows!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night for their VIP deal on craft beer night.  What a rip off.  We paid $60 to get in.  We were treated to communal hitting bay where we had to take turns with everyone else (can't keep a game going with your buds due to other people in the line), cold plate that never got replenished (only had few pieces of cold cut on each pile with grape and 3 cheeses) and the beers were served in a small Dixie cup thing that only got filled half way.  If you go, don't fall into the trap of 'VIP' because you and about couple hundred 'VIP' will be stuck in the same place."}
{"text":"This is a fun and casual place, but certainly not a place to go work on your game.  The balls will not fly correctly (lacks yardage) and the AstroTurf will have you practicing ill advised shots.  However, it is a casual atmosphere with food and beverages and an opportunity to shoot the sh!t with your buds.  The wait time on the weekend (Spring Training?) were over an hour so be sure plan ahead."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to kill some time on the strip or just to escape the strip. The guys can play golf and our women can relax in the sun and sip on drinks. Or vice versa. 

The facility is brand new, very well built and very professional. 

Staff are nice and professional and they are on it. You never get thirsty that's for sure

As for the game it's good.  You can just bang the balls to the back or place some games with precision. A little mix for all levels of players

I definitely recommend this to anyone in the area"}
{"text":"This was our first time to this Top Golf. It was SO much fun! The atmosphere was fantastic & the customer service was superb! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place....tons of fun.  Pretty disappointed that no woods or drivers are allowed.  I'm hoping they get that problem corrected at some point.  Otherwise, thisis a fun place to play."}
{"text":"Absolutely love coming here! It's a great night out for groups. There's normally a bit of a wait depending on when you go and what time. I have found it to be crowded in Friday's and Saturdays between 7-9. The wait can be anywhere from 30-90 minutes. There are 3 floors; I love being on the 3rd floor, it has the best view with the Talking Stick Resort in the background. There are multiple games you can choose from and it's a great way to have a little friendly competition. 

The food here is really good and a lot to choose from. The crab cake and pulled pork sliders are my favorite. The best dessert which we always get is the injectable donuts. It comes with like 10-12 mini donuts and you can choose the chocolate, raspberry, or Bavarian cream to fill with. The drinks here also good and a variety to choose from. 

The service here is good but it does get super busy so they do their best to be attentive but don't expect fast service at those times. 

Prices might seem a little high but it's worth it and it's being split amongst however many are playing since it's a rate per bay. Also if you extend time and choose not to play; they put the credit on your Topgolf card so you can use it next time."}
{"text":"This place is fun! Pricey, but fun.  We took some friends from out of town here and they loved it.  Being on the 2nd or 3rd floor tiers are more fun because you have a better view of the range and the likelihood of making it into one of the targets is easier. :) They have clubs for kids, as well.  The food is good and the service is really great.  Friendly staff always ready to help out and be at your service.  I'd definitely go again, but when my pockets are a little more full."}
{"text":"Why isn't there a Topgolf near where I live? This place is incredible! We arrived at 11:30 on Sunday morning and there was already a 45 minute wait. We sipped drinks at the bar while waiting for a bay to over up.

We were set up at one of the lower level bays. We paid $35 for one hour of \"golf\" and ordered additional food and drinks with our server. We played a simple game where we could earn points by hitting any of the targets. I like the automated ball dispenser. Wave a club and like magic, a ball comes out!

Since we had a tight timeline, we had to leave after just one hour. I would've loved to stay longer or to come at night."}
{"text":"At long last TopGolf CLT!

Me & James flew into town on Friday and made a beeline to TopGolf to meet up with Ben & Dora. A great weather day and the staff was enthusiastic about getting everyone checked in and in a bay.

It wasn't long after we arrived that we were enjoying some great cold beverages, appetizers and swinging away!

Our server Toni took care of us and made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. The food quality is good and the prices are a bit on the high side but it's worth it.

I've been to the TopGolf Alexandria, Va, the 1st one and also the one in Sterling, Va.
This one is a little different in that it does;'t have the surround sofas at the bays. All but a couple have the high top tables which are really better if your eating.

Is you like golf and being outside with your friends, you'll like this place."}
{"text":"From the drive in to the drive out, I had a pleasant and enjoyable time. Finding this location which is on Koval and Harmon was easy and just so you know, you enter on Koval side. There was more than enough parking when the three of us went to experience the new place in town. There are three levels of enjoyment all with their own bar on it (happy dance). The second level actually has big, i mean gigantic screen tvs and games to keep you busy while you wait for your time to be called. I highly recommend the third level as it was more of a view and if you have kids, the first level would be more ideal as it is on the ground and there are holes near the hitting area. 

Prices aren't as crazy as one might think. There are different prices for different times of day and different levels. You pay by the hour and it doesn't matter if you're going solo or with a group of 8. The prices are what it is. If there are more than 3 people in your group I highly suggest going for at least 2 hours so everyone can get the full enjoyment. My group of 3 had two rounds of fun. You can either free range hit or they have various games you could play. 

Service from the entrance to the exit was on point as well. All the employees were high spirited and more than helpful about anything we needed or needed to know. 

Food and drinks were up there too. Me and my sister in law ordered a sangria and a margarita. We even got them in their golf bag cups which you can keep and who wouldn't want this cute souvenir especially since it light's up! And contrary to the over pour of liquor that most Strip venues tend to do, our drinks were perfect. We ordered their nacho stack with carne asada and their yellowtail sashimi with avocado ice cream. Yes, you read that right. AVOCADO.ICE.CREAM. i know you're mind is spinning right? Believe it or not, it was worth indulging in. The ice cream paired with the sashimi and thick ponzu sauce was SO GOOD, I was tempted to order another round of it. But I had a mountain of nachos I needed to finish (and didn't) first. 

This is definitely a place to come and experience either as a group, family affair or even for date night. I mean any girl who is up for looking goofy and/or being competitive is a keeper right?"}
{"text":"I'm a pretty active person and love trying and playing sports. So, from time to time, I like to come here and humble myself with the reality that golf is still something I suck at. After slicing and shanking away, I usually get in a comfort zone and start to hit fairly far and accurate-making myself feel better. If I can't do that, I'll just look around at the hundreds of people there that are struggling even worse than me-and that'll make me feel better instead.

The food and drinks here are really good, a bit more elevated than your standard sports bar type food. Some cocktails are a bit pricey, but, the more you drink the less you care about your crappy golf swing so you tend to go with it regardless. Atmosphere is fun, always neat to come with friends. If you are good at golf, bring your friends here and revel in the fact that you are superior to them.

Sometimes, the popularity of the place is a bit overwhelming so it gets a bit crazy. Going in the AM is both cheaper and less chaotic. I do sometimes get scared when a lane of children is next to me. Between the fear that their swing is so bad that I'll get hit and their erratic approach/follow-through that causes me to worry their about to tumble over the edge, it can be a be unnerving."}
{"text":"This place is great, a driving range on steroids! It has 4 levels, tons of game options, bring your own clubs or use theirs, and room for 10 people in each bay (but only 6 can golf at a time). Typical strip drink prices, and the prices to rent each bay go up depending on what level you choose. Obviously cheaper earlier in the day. Great place to hang out with friends for fun instead of your usual bowling alley or bar. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a party in one of the second level bays, such a neat experience ! I would definitely recommend coming here. We had children with our party , and they had clubs his size so that he was able to play too. The service was great, everyone was helping and working hard to keep our party going. Great for families or date nights !"}
{"text":"While the Phoenix Open was getting rained out, this was a convenient location to go and hit a few golf balls.  I had a great time.  I had a bloody Mary, that was fantastic, to get the day started.  

You should visit their website for details, but they charge by the hour.  And depending on the time of day, the price per hour increases as the day progresses.  We went in the morning at the $25 an hour rate.  

There are a variety of different games one can play.  

The food was surprisingly good.

My only issue with this place is the lack of \"scalable\" fun.  How about small kids?  I know a gang of pre schoolers would love to play golf there, but they probably would never get a ball in a target.  Docking TG a star for that ."}
{"text":"Maybe I should come here at night, get a tee up on a top floor and be on a date but this just wasn't a great time for me. I don't like the fact you can't make a time reservation without money commitment. The hour plus wait to start playing just wasn't worth it. I did like their beer selection and their appetizers were decent (but nothing I would order again). We had the fried pickles, queso with guacamole chips, flatbreads (steak and buffalo) and ice cream cookie. The best app was the buffalo flatbread, the rest were anticlimactic. The service was good but I just felt bored with the golf concept. At the end of the day you are still golfing so if you don't love golfing (I actually do like it) this might not be a fun time for you. It reminded me of bowling where it's continual waiting and confusion on who's turn it is. Next time I think I will just sneak a 6 pack into the driving range and save myself the time and wait!"}
{"text":"Way over priced!! Rude employees!! Not worth the value. So complicated to get started."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and it's been a good experience.  It is a touch overpriced food wise but what do you expect really!!  The wait lines are always long
On weekends and to reserve online you have to pay a extra fee which to me is stupid.  But it's fun, clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"We decided to do away with just dining out on Valentine's day and try something different. Topgolf it was and we really enjoyed the experience - golf games, drinks, food and some good old fashion fun. I'm not much of a golfer but really enjoyed my time. Will definitely be back to a TG near you."}
{"text":"For years i heard of Top golf in Atlanta where my sister resides, finally one was built here in Charlotte probably going on about two years now and  just now visiting, i know sad. Well i didn't get the full experience i went here with a friend to sit at the bar for drinks only, but while i was there we walked around and looked at all of the action that was going on and taking place. Their was a lot of wanna be professional golfers and some that was there for strictly fun.My food was pretty good i ordered an appetizer nothing major.Will be doing an update review once i go and actually play golf and get that experience here. Until then i enjoyed my time here and my food."}
