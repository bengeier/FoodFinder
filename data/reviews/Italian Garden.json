{"text":"While I do agree with Sean H about the great ranch (and breaded mushrooms), I will say that this is the first and likely the last time I'll get take out from Italian Garden. The crust on our pizza tasted and looked under cooked. I had to put it back in the oven once we got it home - not only because it was cold (we live 8-10 minutes away) but because the crust is just really more like dough. We waited about 10 minutes for our pick up to be ready after hearing the associate say \"we just got the first delivery order of the night\" around 6:45."}
{"text":"Everything I have tried at Italian Garden has been great!  I had lunch and dinner there many times!  Their lunch specials are great for the price!  The wraps are my favorite by far.  Another thing that is always nice at restaurants is great staff!  Chris, Rose and the gang are always very courteous and quick to help!"}
{"text":"Order take out once a week and it's always great! Friendly staff and great pizza. Locally owned and operated with a menu that includes burgers and sandwiches that are all awesome! Best ranch dressing on the planet!"}
