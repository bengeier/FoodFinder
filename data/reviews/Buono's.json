{"text":"I actually started this review four months ago but decided not to post it because I was afraid I was being unnecessarily harsh. However, I told the story to someone recently and the first thing they asked was if I posted it on Yelp because it's pretty bad. So since my unfinished saved review was staring me in the face as I logged in today, I figured I'd just do it.   I could just sum up my whole review now and say don't waste your time because all this place gave me was horrible service, high prices, and generic food, but I figure I should give more evidence to back it up. I recently moved back to town and was excited to see an Italian restaurant right around the corner from my new home so I wanted to try it out ASAP.   When you walk in the door it is very unclear what you are supposed to do. No one greets you, no one seats you, nothing. There are menus on the tables and a sign that says \"ORDER HERE\" at the counter. We sat down for a minute to look at the menu but no one came over to help us so we figured we had to go up to the counter to order. We were helped by an older gentleman. I'm not sure if he was the owner. Based on the conversation he was having with another customer (who was clearly  more important than we were) I think he was.   I ordered the gnocchi and my health conscious friend ordered a turkey sub. We have a serious lack of Italian restaurants here in Chandler so it is very hard to find gnocchi. Because of this, I order it whenever I have the chance. I was so excited to see it on the menu I immediately discarded my plan of ordering pizza. I've had gnocchi dozens of times in my life, both good and bad. This stuff was awful. It wasn't even edible. I never complain about food, I just eat it. I couldn't do it this time. I brought it back up to the counter and politely asked for something else. The older gentleman rudely asked why and when I explained and he said \"that's how it's supposed to be.\" He agreed to make me some basic spaghetti when he realized I wasn't going to just take it back to my table and stare at it.   In the meantime my friend ate her turkey sub. It wasn't very good, either. Very expensive for three pieces of turkey, but I guess you shouldn't have high hopes when you order turkey at a pizza place.  While I was waiting for my replacement spaghetti I watched her eat the entire sub. It didn't take long. I also watched the older gentleman who was \"helping\" us proceed to leave the restaurant, get into his vehicle (parked right up front in a handicapped parking spot), and drive away. My friend jokingly said \"hah, you're never getting your spaghetti now.\" She was right.  I went up to the counter about ten minutes later to inquire about my food and the girl that was now in charge had no idea what I was talking about. She didn't offer to make me the spaghetti herself, she didn't apologize, nothing. I paid for our drinks and the overpriced turkey sub (which she tried to overcharge me for as well!) and we left very unhappy. I enjoyed a wonderful meal across the parking lot at Taco Bell instead that night."}
{"text":"Okay, I gotta say, I love this style of pizza. It's inexpensive, fresh, and I love the crust, just like NY style. Much better than Streets of New York! Their pizza is over seasoned and greasy, and much more expensive.   If you want a down to earth neighborhood pizza place this is it. And I can't say enough about the owner Dave! He's a colorful guy straight from New York with lots of yankee info. (used to work the stadium)   So go see Dave and get a slice and a beer. Just tell em Susan sent ya! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Horrible pizza trying to pass it off as Buonos. The original in Mesa. This place fails. Don't know what they're doing back there but it doesn't taste like Buonos AT ALL."}
{"text":"Recently tried takeout from this spot to see what all the rave was about. Must say I dont really get the hype. Very plain NY style pizza. Im not a huge NY pizza fan but in comparison to some of my fave places this pizza was just too bland for my liking. Also, we tried the mushrooms and zucchini and they tasted like cardboard. I am all about quality food and they havent really pegged this aspect in my opinion. I think the cheese was overall the best part. If you are in this neighborhood, Grimaldis is right across the street and offers the best pizza around - Wood Grilled! I may take another shot at a later date to try their calzones but not a big fan of their pizza.   Very similar atmosphere to Barros but better pizza then they offer on the Chicago side."}
{"text":"To those of us from back east, anything \"authentic\" is to be revered.  We view our former homes as \"the motherland\" and are constantly trying to find pieces of it in our new, adopted locale.  So my family is always trying to find authentic foods of any ethnicity.  One of the most important is pizza.  So today I walked into Buono's.  I dared to ask Dave, the owner, if it was really authentic and he asked me, in his thick NYC accent, what part I was from (people often mistake me for a New Yorker).  When I told him \"Boston\" he said he'd serve me anyway.  I got everything I wanted at Buono's today.  I got truly authentic pizza that was absolutely incredible.  I got the kind of charm from Dave that makes me long for the coast, the kind that people unfortunate enough to be from elsewhere foolishly mistake for rudeness.  I got a half hour of New York in Chandler, AZ.  I basked in my moment, being at home in the motherland.  I ate with relish.  I savored the banter.  I made a friend.  Dave told me to come 'round with the family.  I can't wait to introduce them."}
{"text":"Continues to impress every time. As a Mainer, I hate the Yankees but Buonos makes up for them. If you really want to hav fun, go in wearing Red Sox/Patriots shirt. Great food and fun place and very reasonable"}
{"text":"The positive reviews have as much to do with the charming big fat New Yorker behind the desk as it does with the pizza. I'm being honest about that. Upon first glance, this place looks like another Arizona strip mall wannabe joint. However, when you walk in, you feel like you are in New York. A rather large man missing teeth who looks like he is in the wintess protection program with a thick New York accent and refreshingly New York attitude approached me. When you see that, you wanna love this place! Unfortunately, the pizza doesn't match. I would give it 3.5 stars.   The pizza is very good but there are better NY style pizza places in Chandler let alone the valley. Jimmy and Joes in Chandler (Ray and McClintock) is clearly better. Rays pizza is also more flavorful. The problem with the pizza is that it is missing that oomph. It lacks flavor.  It does taste a little generic. The cheese is nothing special. The crust was adequate but not noteworthy, it tastes pretty doughy.  The nice thing is this place is cheap. 2 slices and a drink for $5 is a steal. Also, this isn't a sit down place. Even the owner wants you to know that. He handed me a menu and said most people call in advance and pick it up (even though the place is brand new). They have tables but they only had one person serving. The impression I gathered is they want this to be a carryout place although technically they have tables"}
{"text":"I'm not from NY and don't claim that this is authentic NY pizza as I wouldn't know, but this is delicious.  What more can I say.  For me it is a tie with Venezia's for the pizza, but Venezia's has better tasting Pepsi so it gets the nod.  But then again Buono's has much more seating.  I'll keep going to both."}
{"text":"I got take out here on the recommendation of a friend.  When I called it was a teenage boy taking my order and he wasn't overly helpful though he was polite enough.  When I arrived it was the same boy giving me my large pizza and wings.  Not overly friendly in person either.  I did not see the owner who I was told to make a point of saying hello to.  I thought the pizza was good.  I loved how thin and really greasy it was.  My son thought the pepperoni tasted like \"vinegar\".  My husband and son both enjoyed the hot wings.  Buono's is to far of a drive from my house for takeout and they don't deliver.  I will have to stick with NYPD Pizza.  (One mile away or I can get delivery!!)"}
{"text":"I'm actually a little shocked at these reviews. Ive had their pizza twice and it's super generic and bland. The ingredients are of poor quality and it's extremely greasy.   With that aside I will say it is GOOD pizza, but I don't think it deserves this high reviews. Try NYPD if you want authentic New York Style pizza with a bit more flavor."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a $5 lunch special... 2 slices and soda. Goth Sausage on one, and mushroom on the other. I had a pie they just pulled from the oven... it was better than the average pie. It is thin crust, which is my preference. I will go back."}
{"text":"I will be honest I'm a pizza snob I grew up on the east coast.  I wouldn't drive all the way across town to eat here like I would for joes ny pizza in scottsdale.  But there is nothing to complain about with this place.  Its good pizza. If you like east coast style pizza this is a must try. I'm looking forward to trying it again because I was extremely hungry when I tried it and you know sometimes when your hungry food tastes better than normal.  But give it a try and let me know what you think.  I'm a little shocked that their rating isnt higher for this place"}
{"text":"My first visit to Buono's I walked up to the door sporting my Red Sox hat (purchased on Yawkey Way in the heart of Chowdah Nation) and stopped dead in my tracks at the huge Yankees logo on the door.  A couple people looked up from behind the counter.  I gave a huge shrug and threw my hands in the air as if to say \"WTF!\"    A tall gentleman behind the counter laughed and beckoned me in.  He informed me that they could help Boston fans as well and that if I just kept right on walking there was another door on the other side that I could leave through.  This was Dave.  We have since chatted a bit about baseball, the abomination that is the new stadium in New York, pizza, people from the east coast, etc.  I have had pizza from here twice now.  Once I picked up a couple pies to share at the office, yesterday the family and I went for dinner and shared a couple pies.  We actually had enough to have it for lunch today.  Great NY style pizza.  We will be going back to try the subs (grinders for Chowdah nation).  Dave is a good sport and takes merciless ribbing pretty well.  When we arrived last night the Yankees had just gotten spanked at Fenway for the second time in a row.  My daughter wanted to walk in singing \"Sweet Caroline\".  So we did.  Walked in to the crowded restaurant surrounded by NY memorabilia belting out \"Sweet Caroline.\"  (If you're not familiar with Fenway, it's a recent and odd tradition during the 8th inning, more on that here: http://www.bostonspastime.com/sweetcaroline.html)  We certainly got a lot of looks from the patrons and a big laugh from Dave.  I met another Red Sox fan (from Fall Rivuh) that enjoys Buono's pizza to much to stay away.  Buono's pizza compares with Grimaldi's but they are cheaper and more down to earth.  So we'll see you for a pie at Buono's from now on.  We miss the NY style pizza and that great east coast attitude."}
