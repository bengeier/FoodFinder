{"text":"I went to this restaurant about a month ago because my husband was looking for a good seafood place near Hudson.  The reviews were good so we were excited to try it. We went to dine in.   First impression: since it is part of a fish market as well it smelled like a fish market as we entered. ..PLUS a smell of old frying oil.  A terrible mix.   I should have listened to my nose and left.  Still, we ordered some food.  They were all VERY mediocre at best. I really feel like all the previous reviews were written by the owner's friends or family.   Shrimp poboy was like $11.00 and had 5 or 6 pieces of med.  Shrimp in it.  It came with some small amount of Cole slaw that was meh and not cold and some hush puppies that were not tasty.   Very very disappointed.  If you want to believe the positive reviews then go ahead and waste your money.  Who knows you may like mediocre food."}
{"text":"Brother in law told me of this place, he's always looking for new places to get a bite, so we thought we'd try this place out. Know first, that this is a seafood market, an amazing one with extremely fresh fish that rivals any in the area. We sat at the little make shift dining area and ordered. The one thing that other members of my group complained about was how long it took to get the food. But hey, it's fresh and prepared right then, there's even a disclaimer saying that it may take a bit. However, they all quickly piped down when the food came to the table, it was amazing! My wife and I have traveled all up and down the east coast, California, and even Ireland, and the seafood here would give any of those joints a run for their money. Amazing little gem tucked away in Twinsburg. They even offer cooking classes! Took some lobster bisque home with me from the market, best I've ever had. Will definitely be going back to this joint!"}
{"text":"This is definitely not a dinner venue.  I can see it possibly being a lunch stop.  I would recommend that Bay Lobsters section off the eat in are from the market as the smell and atmosphere are not restaurant quality at all.  And being served on paper plates and using plastic forks and knives is something to be desired.   I have been here twice for dinner and tried the fish basket and lobster roll.  I enjoyed the fish basket, but the lobster roll really was not something to write home about and it was pricey at $15.  Overall, I think the prices are too high and probably that way to pay for the many coupons customers use from what I can see.  I also don't like the dress code the employees have as I not comfortable having my food cooked by someone who does no look the part.  That's all I'll say about that.  I have purchased from Bay Lobsters in the past and enjoyed their fish at home.  But as a diner, not."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped here to eat lunch last weekend. Having never been here, we went based on reviews. We were not disappointed! The food was great! The staff was friendly, and the cafe filled up while we were there. I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"They opened one in Wooster....  http://www.yelp.com/biz/baylobsters-cafe-and-fish-market-wooster-2"}
{"text":"I was in area for business and found this awesome place on Yelp.  What a treat - fresh fish, veggies, cooked perfect with right spices.   John and Cindy were so kind and gracious - loved the whole experience!"}
{"text":"Awesome.  My grandfather was in the fish business his entire life in the Youngstown area.  We would always get fish from him and once he stopped we have not been able to find a good place for fish.  Look no further as this is the place we have been looking for.  A great addition to the area!"}
{"text":"Best place in the area to buy fresh seafood. Awesome selection and super friendly people really make you want to shop there. the staff is very knowledgeable and willing to answer any questions you have. I buy a lot of seafood so there repeat customer program is great, $10.00 off next purchase when you accumulate $100.00 spent (easier to do than you think). Give them a look."}
{"text":"Alright, Yelp!  I've been working in Twinsburg for so long that I thought I knew about all the lunch places around here.  Never would have noticed this place if not for Yelp.    I had the crab cake sandwich to go for $8.99, and was very pleased.  You get 2 sides, and there are about 10 to choose from, which is great.  I had the cole slaw (very good) and the green beans (ordinary).  I got my crab cake with lettuce, tomato, and remoulade on a wheat bun.  The crab cake itself was good, but maybe a little mushy.  The wheat bun was better than expected.    I called my order in at the peak of the lunch rush, and they had it ready when I got there.  I will definitely come back some time and try the lobster roll."}
{"text":"Excellent family owned store that gets fresh seafood two to three times a week! The Smoked Salmon Wrapped Scallops and Lobster Rolls are great.  Also has frozen seafood and fresh lobster.  Smoked Salmon Bisque is also a hit!  Glad to have them in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"The lobsters here are good, but have a tough shell. I have found out about this through a Mom's friend who went shopping here. The food here looks good. I like the display of the lobster with the tee shirt, very cute!!!"}
{"text":"I have family that live in the Twinsburg area and I was recently visiting them when stumbled across this place on yelp, so I gave it a try.  I was starving for lunch while my cousins were getting their nails done a couple of doors down from this place so I walked down a few doors and saw that they served lunch here.    I ordered the lobster roll with two sides (hush puppies and a small salad).  The lobster roll was delicious.  I've been to Maine and eaten lobster rolls there and even out of food trucks in DC and the lobster rolls here measured up to the ones that you can get there.  They're a little bit smaller than the regular lobster rolls you get but the ratio of lobster to roll is perfect.  There's a little bit of celery in the mixture as well to give it a little crunch as well.  The girl at the counter who helped us was extremely friendly and even let me try the lobster mixture before I ordered my sandwich to see if I liked it or not.  The hush puppies were freshly made and yummy.  I even picked out a soup from their frozen section and they warmed it up for me and brought it to my table.  There are a couple of tables to sit at and the owner/manager even came around and checked on us and the other people dining in to see how we were doing.  The selection of sea food and already prepared foods looked interesting as well.  Overall: delicious lobster rolls + yummy sides + warm, friendly staff = I wish they were closer to me so I could go there more."}
{"text":"First time visitor to this establishment. The staff was very helpful and our clam bake was great with some oysters on the side. I will go back."}
{"text":"I'm gonna keep this simple, no bull.  Been around the world 3 times, lived in too many places I've lost count (on the coast off the coast)...have never tasted fish and chips of this caliber ANYWHERE!!! Not kidding!!!  All of their stuff is awesome, just go and get ANYTHING and you will enjoy.  Thanks Captain John...you the man!!!"}
{"text":"Lent Review  Some recent additions to this Route 91 fixture... they now have cafe seating and an expanded menu of sandwiches and meals... they now smoke fish!  It may just be for a limited time but so far everything that we have tried that they smoke has  been a hit.  My mom and husband love the smoked scallop soup... and today we picked up some Salmon wrapped Scallops that have been smoked... AMAZING!!!  They get shipment direct from Boston several times a week and post the selection to their facebook page along with recipes and articles on the sustainable fish they carry.  They just expanded their lobster tank foot print and have been putting together clam bakes for YEARS... always astounded by the volume of parties they handle all summer long.  Call ahead if there is something you really want when they post the new selection and send out the e-mail letter... the yearly Copper River Salmon used to be the hottest ticket of the year... but this smoking may just over take that!  If you are ordering meals to go over the phone double check everything before you leave... they get super busy and we've had mix ups with sides and sauces... they always straighten it out... but something to watch out for."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this cafe for a while., We were in the area so stopped in and had the grouper lunch special.  Pro's:  at least a 1/2 lb serving with 2 sides.  Con's:  ordered it grilled and it was overcooked and dried out.  Sides (fries, and okra) were ok, probably frozen.  Very disappointed with the grouper; you'd think a seafood place would know how to grill fish!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!  I often pass by the plaza where BayLobsters Market is located, and decided to stop here today after a friend told me about their lobster roll. The staff was very friendly and attentive as soon as I walked in the door, which is always a plus.  The roll was $13.99 which included two sides. I chose the hush puppies and coleslaw.  While I was waiting for my order I browsed the seafood selection, and asked a staff member about the quality of the frozen breaded calamari. She stated that it's one of their top sellers and immediately offered to have the cook fry a few pieces for me to sample. I was honestly shocked and accepted the offer. The calamari was good, so I ended up buying a bag.   I will definitely be back, next time I'll probably try the bacon wrapped scallops.  I also meant to take a pic of my dinner, but I ate it too fast!  lol!"}
{"text":"Anyone know why they closed?! So disappointed.  Was a great place to buy seafood locally and avoid grocery store fish."}
{"text":"Lobster rolls are excellent!!  Good fish selection.  Friendly staff. Nice free rewards program. ($200 = $10 off)  Reccomended."}
{"text":"I ate at this venue for the first time for dinner.  I was very disappointed.  I ordered the fish and chips.  My fish was not cooked through all the way in the center and had little flavor.  The cole slaw also had no flavor.  The chips, however, were very good.  I read reviews online after I came home and it made me think I didn't eat at the same place!  Not what I expected as I'd heard that the fish market sold very high quality fish."}
{"text":"Looking for sushi grade fish. Only two items, sea scallop and Ahi tuna. Prices are high too. I guess Ohio is not the best place to look for sushi grade fish! At least they had some, most places have none."}
{"text":"They are primarily a fish market but they also offer a small menu of ocean hot foods. I ordered the deep fried oysters ($7.99) which came with two sides. The oysters were very good and I would return for them again. The lady who took my order was also quite friendly. This is a take-out with no tables to sit and eat."}
{"text":"Bogus....sign says new hours till 7:30. It is 6:49 pm and they are closed.  This place may have good food, they may have the worst food ever, but I just wasted 20 minutes driving here to spend and now I will never know because they are closed.   If they monitor yelp maybe they can update their hours so others aren't disappointed."}
{"text":"I think that I can fairly say that this is the best seafood in Ohio. Came in with the wife and had the steamed lobster, cod fish and chips, monkfish and scallop soup, and half a dozen shrimp cocktail and fresh oysters. Yeah ok we ate a lot but they had so much fresh seafood on display that you can't really just pick one thing. The fish and chips was amazing. Perfect breading and such great taste in the cod. The lobster was great, best that we've had in Ohio. Almost tasted like it came directly out of the ocean. They even make their own soda. We tried the Orange which was great. The staff was super friendly and let us try all of the soups before we made a decision. It's a very casual place with small tables next to the market displays. We even joined their rewards program to get $10 back for every $300 spent. Even though we don't live here, we'll find a way to come back."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for lunch yesterday after reading Yelp! reviews on it.  Bay Lobsters is about 45 minutes from my place in Niles, but for good food, I'm willing to drive it.  The staff here were super-friendly, from the young lady who took my order, to the gentleman who cooked it and brought it to me.  I decided to go with a sandwich I'd been dying to try...the lobster roll.  Being in NE Ohio, there aren't many places that serve a lobster roll, so I had to go for it.  It comes served on your choice of white or wheat New England style roll.  The lobster is a generous portion of chopped claw and knuckle meat mixed with a bit of finely chopped celery.  The only other thing on the roll is lettuce.  Plain and simple.  It was outstanding!  Every 4 or 5 bites, I'd sprinkle a few drops of Tabasco Sauce on it just for little kick, but it didn't really need it.  The lobster roll comes with your choice of 2 sides.  I chose tater tots and their delicious hush puppies.  This place also has live lobsters, and a nice selection of fresh and frozen seafood, as well as soups and spices.  I didn't pay attention to it at the time, but I noticed from the pics on Yelp! that they carry frozen crawfish tails.  I am definitely picking some of those up next time I am here.  Although Philly Cheesesteaks are still my #1, the lobster roll is quickly becoming my new sandwich obsession.  I will be back here to order it again.  Soon."}
{"text":"Love this place. Staff is having fun and it shows in outstanding customer service. Great selection of fresh seafood as well as an expanded menu of prepared foods."}
{"text":"This place is authentic! I love seafood but it is hard to find unless you live near the coast or pay insane amounts. Found this place on a business trip and thought I would take a chance. Glad I did!  Lobster roll is great!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Twinsburg for over 20 years. I have been aware of Bay Lobsters for a long time but I was hesitant to try a fish market in land locked Twinsburg, but I decided to give it a shot based on good Yelp reviews, and I was in the mood for a lobster roll.   I was greeted upon entering. I ordered a lobster roll lunch with hush puppies and green beans. Mind you, my first lobster roll experience was in Bar Harbor so the bar was set pretty high. It was excellent. It could have been from any of the numerous New England establishments I have tried. The hush puppies were also excellent with great flavor and cooked perfectly. I also have no complaints regarding the service. My food was made fresh and my wait time could not have been more than 5 minutes. It was late afternoon between lunch and dinner but there was another diner just ahead of me.   If you are a seafood lover or just want to try an authentic lobster roll, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yelp does it again.  I never would have stopped in for lunch had I not found it on Yelp.  I probably would have stopped in to purchase lobsters, you know, that one time every 10 years I buy lobsters, but I wouldn't stop into a strip mall and grab lunch at a fish market.  Well, I did have a vacation day from work and treated myself to a me day.  And in my book, an awesome lunch is required.  If it's fried, that's even better.  So Bay Lobsters had a fried perch lunch with coleslaw, hush puppies, and fries.  Yea, everything, in one meal, for $10.  It was like a day on Lake Erie or a trip to Florida, because I didn't expect to find fresh fried fish in Twinsburg.  I probably would ask to step into the kitchen and help them make the slaw, since it was just ok, the rest of the meal was perfect.    They've also go a rewards program, so if you're buying to cook at home or eating there, you get credit towards more!  Free fish, baby!"}
{"text":"Very pleasant staff, the food is well prepared, and the price is right. They have a long list of fresh fish, any of which can be ordered fried or broiled. I had fish 'n' chips. The fish t was coated in crumbs rather than a batter, which is what I would have preferred.  However my personal preference doesn't take away from the fact that the fish itself was fresh and properly fried. I took home \"chowda\" and lobster mac 'n' cheese both of which which were very tasty.  I will definitely go back, just won't get the fried fish next time."}
