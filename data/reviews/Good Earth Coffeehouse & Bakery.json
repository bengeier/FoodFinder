{"text":"Open 24 hours with great WiFi HALLELUJAH! friendly staff and a great place to get some work done with big windows all around you."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start. I love the layout, really cool furniture and lots of natural lighting. BUT the service :( Oooh the service. I will start off by saying there is one girl there that always has a smile on her face and makes my coffee perfectly every time. But whenever she is not there I have left there with...well really shitty coffee and service. One time when asked for a half sweet mocha it felt like they doubled the sweetness instead...how does that work?! That same order she handed me the drink and then oops she forgot to put the espresso in...are you serious. The night time staff do not seem to be very educated either. Both times I've been there past 9 they have messed up my order :(. I really really wanted this to be my go to spot, but until the service gets better it definitely won't be. The only reason it's getting an extra star is for the one worker there that always makes my day! Keep her around :)"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly, coffee is good and it's an AMAZING spot to study all day at (free wifi and lots of tables with lots of windows around = natural light). At night they turn their really cool  lights on and it creates a really calming atmosphere! Thanks Good Earth for putting up for me in the majority of May! I passed my exam and I owe you one!"}
{"text":"Located in the deep SE this Good Earth is often packed with a variety of clientele as there's great seating to accommodate meetings, those working remotely (great wifi!) and friends meeting up, it's also across the street from the SE Hospital. There's a variety of seating and great lighting as it's in the corner spot for the businesses in the strip and has large glass windows on three sides.   It's easy to grab a treat, coffee and then connect to wifi before settling in for the long haul. If I have a meeting at Good Earth I often arrive early to get work done and then stay long after the meeting is done, what can I say? It's a great cozy coffee shop in the south!"}
{"text":"Great little cafe to sit and relax in with a coffee. It's got amazing large windows that let in tons of light, makes it feel really 'homey'. I can't believe I haven't stopped here before. They've got a really nice large patio too."}
{"text":"Good Earth in the Seton Community of the far SE quadrant of Calgary is a great place for meeting clients.  This is my second meeting at this location and the coffee was great and the snacks delicious.   The cafe is newer, the staff are happy, the seating is comfortable, the washrooms are clean, and it is located just off of Deerfoot Trail, which makes it accessible from anywhere in the City.  There were several other consultants meeting with clients so clearly this place works for that.   Thanks again Good Earth!  ~ Shane Keller"}
