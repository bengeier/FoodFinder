{"text":"Best food ever, better then desert house and better then shawarma palace best donate in town I think, family owned and best service always looking to get your order the way you want it 5/5"}
{"text":"Yep, this is the real deal. Had beef donair, and it had a nice home made taste. Portions were generous and price was good. Inside is also clean and spacious so no need to take away."}
{"text":"I don't typically care enough about the places I eat to post online reviews but I had to say something about Deagla. These guys are in my opinion the best donair/shawarma shop in town, and this is not a title I bestow lightly.
-Food is fantastic, everything is made in house including the recently added Samosas, sooo good. They will make what you order exactly like you want it and the selection of toppings and sauces is the best I've seen.
-The business is ran by a mother and son, they are the nicest people and provide killer service. I actually feel good about going here every time I do.
-Prices are as good or better than any other donair/shawarma shop.

Keep up the great work guys!!!"}
{"text":"This family run place has excellent kebabs and shawarmas. They have a good selection of salads and sides, but getting some of the mixed shawarma on the homemade bread cannot be missed!"}
{"text":"Went to This restaurant for the first time today! It is defiantly a hidden gem. The owners were so friendly and welcoming. The atmosphere is warm and the restaurant is clean. We ordered donairs, everything looked so fresh and homemade. Beautiful salads, fresh hummus, taboulie, baklava. The portions were very generous and the taste, incredible! I have found a new favourite donair shop, honestly prob the best donair I have ever had. I grew up in the N.e so there are lots of shops around and I have tried most. It's right across from Desert pita, check it out. Will be back!!!"}
