{"text":"Food in this place is unbelievable ... I am a bit puzzled as to whether this restaurant will survive at this location, as it always seems to be so quiet and empty. I have gone three times so far, ate something different each time and just loved the food. I wish more people would try it out and it would pick up because it would be a better atmosphere to be in a great crowded restaurant."}
{"text":"This place blew me away!!! The place was quiet so I didn't know what to expect but was instantly greated by friendly staff, soothing music and a beautiful table. The food was best I have ever had while out for supper. I had the bacon wrapped ostrich steak... Simply amazing! I wouldn't hesitate to try everything on their menu eventually base on that meal alone. Enjoy everyone!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a Saturday night with a trio of friends.  

First off, the decor has not change an iota from when this was Jam Cafe...not a big deal, but I think it could have done with some freshening up on the decor side.

We were seated without fuss, the place was nearly empty.  We were offered our choice of spots to sit and we chose the back room of the restaurant.

Our server was friendly enough, but he sounded a bit pretentious with what can only be described as some sort of weird snotty accent...anyway, I digress.  

We had had a glass of wine at our friends' home before walking over to the restaurant and were pleasantly surprised to see that they had the same bottle on offer on their wine list - YAY!!! However, our joy was short lived once we were informed that they were out of that particular wine...actually they were out of all their wines with the exception of 2 bottles.  We chose one of the remaining vintages and then ordered our food.

Two of us had the smoked bacon wrapped ostrich filet, while the other folks in our party ordered the Muskoka BBQ'd steak and the Duckling comfit risotto.   We also ordered the Boar Sausage and Grilled Calamari appetizers.

Fast forward to our empty wine glasses, appetizers have been served and devoured (they were DELICIOUS) and we are patiently awaiting our mains.  Our bottle of wine is empty and we request another, at which point, we are told that they've sent someone to the LCBO to pick up a bottle for us, since they're now out of that wine too.  

Luckily, by the time our entrees arrive, the server has returned from the LCBO with our wine bottle in hand. The new bottle's vintage is 2 years older than the one we just consumed and it hasn't really had time to breathe, but who cares at this point.  We've been sitting with empty glasses for a good 10 minutes. Not a crime I realize, but still not really great.

The one saving grace?  The entrees were incredible!  The risotto was creamy and full of flavour, the steak cooked perfectly, and the smoked bacon wrapped ostrich is something I plan on having again.

We ordered dessert, an apple pie served with Asiago cheese and a slice of chocolate cake...with 4 forks, please.

The apple pie was very sweet and it came with a sliver of Swiss cheese (guess they were out of Asiago as well), but the chocolate cake was divine...sadly it was a bit too sweet for my taste, but everyone else loved it.

In short, I would return to this place, but I cannot give it higher than 3 stars because the service was average at best and they ran out of wine and cheese!   This of course could all be due to the venue's being newly opened and the fact that the Cabbagetown Festival was happening that weekend...they may not have anticipated the higher volume of traffic.  

Bottom line, if they work out the kinks, this place could have some real staying power because the food is top notch!"}
