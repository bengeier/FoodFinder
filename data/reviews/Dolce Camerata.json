{"text":"I'm here right now. On a late Wednesday night this makes a good study spot for the university student cramming for exams, too lazy to travel downtown to a late night cafe. It's not bright enough to pore over handwritten notes, but decent enough for laptop work. 

Dimly lit and mediocre internet radio music aside, the servers are friendly, polite and will let you work in peace. I had the mango crepe and a blueberry cheesecake -- both were surprisingly good! They have a pretty decent menu, with tons of coffee options. The Cinammon Dolce was pretty nice, but not sweet enough for me. 

Overall, good cafe/bar. Will come again. My minor gripe is how distracting the various coloured lasers zipping across the cafe are. Kinda makes a guy want to stop studying and start dicking around on Yelp, you know?"}
{"text":"Great place to drink coffee. The patio is a nice place to sit and talk with friends. The breakfast menu is not bad either, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is somewhat okay, but it seems it's too dark. It could be a bit confusing to decide whether this is a cafe or a place without the light. The drinks are average, once again, they are slow at serving the customers."}
{"text":"This is my second time going to this place.  And I am convinced the staff or server I have is racist towards anyone who is not Asian or white.  The first time I came here my desert took 30 minutes to come . I figured it was just bad service . Second time  I came here with my daughter we ordered and my food never came.  On check out they wanted to charge us.  I was so upset and they try to apologize with fake smiles.  Stay away from this place if you are non white or Asian."}
{"text":"Interior is nice... food 50-50 ... I love crepes but their crepes are not much to brag about, also quite expensive for such a quality.. coffee absolutely terrible.. taste like burnt,especially espressos.."}
{"text":"Convenient location but their Americano is horrible. It was too water down as if it was brew coffee.
The patio is nice to sit when weather is nice!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday evening for dessert at Dolce Camerata and this place was... well... deserted.  We thought this was good, since we got seats right away. 

It's not often that I'm at Centerpoint Mall, but I have seen Dolce Camerata full while the mall is open. They offer a mix of paninis, salads and korean food for lunch and dinner, plus an all-day breakfast menu - but only till 5pm... huh?? 

We had:
- mango cheesecake
it was really the only good thing we had, but it wasn't made in-house
- plain crepe with sugar
it was over cooked, maybe they need more training on this.
- waffle with vanilla ice cream, strawberries and bananas
it was okay, the waffle batter lacked flavour so it was good we had the ice cream and fruits

Service was quick, but it was pretty empty. While I was paying at the counter, I was wondering why my friend had picked up our plates - she said there was a sign somewhere to clear our own table and bring it to the counter... double huh??

Dolce Camerata is okay, but I've had better dessert at Pickle Barrel. Don't think I'd go back.

Pros:  There's tons of parking especially when the mall is closed,.  Live music on Friday and Saturday evening - tonight was a saxophonist."}
{"text":"It was my second time in that coffee shop, It was decent and around average in the first time and I was waiting for a friend the second time I visited there. It took me a while to order something, I understand why a business requires anyone in their restaurant to order first but shouldnt the waitress let us know and then be mad to that extent?? 
She started yelling and said that she knows me and Im always going there and not order anything. This was very rude and very stupid. I have never seen that women before and It was my second time in the coffee shop. im pretty sure i havent been in the area for more than a year. Im sorry that I forgot to order immediately but i was still right there, she could be polite and remind me and of course I will order. 
that was very disappointing and stupid."}
{"text":"Came here for the Korean ice shaved dessert! I got the mango and the original red bean. I've tried better locations but this one in particular is decently good. They do however have a variety of other desserts and drinks which I haven't tried so I'll have to return to try those out."}
{"text":"I discovered this little hidden gem just this weekend.  Was with my sister and had their coffee and Americano respectively.  They also have a patio but we didn't go outside as there were people smoking.

It's located in Centerpoint Mall right beside No Frills Supermarket, a good place to relax and chill.

Coffee is self-serve after you pay, and it's organic according to the label.

Both regular coffee and the Americano are delicious, staff very friendly, told me they are open until 11pm Monday to Saturday, and Sundays until 10pm.

The only thing I don't like as much is the d√©cor (except the hanging lights).  So I am only giving it 4 stars.

Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"In a neighbourhood where halfway-decent wifi coffee shops are as rare as a lion walking furless through a field of kimchee, Dolce Camerata earns my vote. I'm not saying it's got great coffee or food, but for this neck of the woods, it's fabulous. 

Service is very friendly, and the low noise level is good for working or reading."}
{"text":"Came in for one of the all-day breakfast specials posted on the board at the entrance, along with the $1 coffee add-on for any of said breakfast specials.  I chose the Veggie Breakfast (toast, 2 eggs, sliced cucumber and tomato, potato wedges, and chick peas).  The coffee is self-serve carafe dispensed, organic, fair trade coffee.  The price posted on the board is $6.95 so with the coffee, should have been charged $8.98, but the bill (which you pay up front at the register where you place your order) was charged as $9.99.  Um ok so let's call that your self-imposed tip and leave it there.

I wasn't given a choice of bread for the toast, which came as whole wheat.  The eggs come in one of three choices of style - scrambled, sunny side up or over easy.  I took them sunny side up and they were nicely cooked.  The tomato slices were a bit thin and the cucumber slices a bit small in diameter.  The wedges are the typical, seasoned potato slices you get at most fast-food places that don't cook their own.  The chick peas are a pickled style presentation, which I'm figuring could be due to the fact that the menu has some Korean offerings.  My palette was fine with those so overall, not a bad meal.  The coffee (choice of regular or decaf) was good and the milk/cream/napkins/sugar/etc. all well-stocked, so that's a plus, and since you get it yourself, there's no wait time which, for me, is a plus, although those who like full service with their restaurant meals are out of luck.  The service for the food was slow, so it's probably a better policy for the coffee at this restaurant.

I'm under the impression there should be free Wi-Fi, but once my breakfast was served I didn't get any further attention from the staff, and frankly, after already feeling a bit dejected about the overcharged bill, I didn't have the heart to go up and ask.  I came to relax in the nicest coffee spot that Centerpoint Mall has to offer so I chose to nurse my coffee a bit longer and save the self-advocacy for every other part of the day where it's far more necessary.

Since it is the nicest coffee spot in the mall, and because the food and coffee were decent (especially if I had been charged the advertised price), I give it the 3 stars.  I like the soft light and comfy benches and most of the decor (although the tables across the fireplace at the back take a lot away from the overall impression) so I may come back if I'm prepared to point out any future price discrepancies and ask for a Wi-Fi password."}
{"text":"neat looking place, service is decent. didn't order to much food so will go again to try the food."}
{"text":"The food doesn't taste very fresh or hot, the place is small, service is slow but friendly. 
I tried the all day breakfast (coffee is $1 extra) for the portion and price, it's better to go up the street on yonge to eggsmart or whimpy's diner or something else.... Won't recommend it here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Came for the coffee and free wifi ($2 for coffee and $1 for each refill). You have to ask them for the wifi password. Very convenient location with ample parking and usually not hard to get a seat and table. I got hungry so I ordered a dessert crepe for about $10 which was pretty good. Cheap beers too!"}
{"text":"I came here for dessert one day.

I had a mango smoothie and my girlfriend had coffee.

The coffee tasted good as well as the mango smoothie.  However, the taste of mango was really weak and the yogurt flavor was much more stronger.

On a side note, I was watching a worker make a crepe.  The person trying to make the crepe really struggled and resulted in an uneven shape with holes in them.  Rolling the crepes hid their shape but I would recommend getting crepes elsewhere."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try after a very unsatisfying dinner at nearby Sariwon (I'll post that review soon).  The space was dimly lit with technicolor disco ball working over time casting Christmas colour dots on the walls.  Add that to the issue with ill-managed thermostat (way too hot!) and Asian elevator music, I would have walked right back out had my family not been there with me.  This is not the kind of place where I would normally feel compelled to hang out in but since we were with two little girls who desperately wanted their chocolate cake fix, I obliged.  

The server was the saving grace as he was attentive, cordial and very helpful with decision making.  We ordered a few lattes and regular coffees and our server actually french-pressed our coffee at our table side, instead of serving stale coffee from a pot.  This was definitely a plus.  Their cakes are supplied by Dufflet which were fine (we sampled chocolate fudge slices and a carrot cake slice along with another mini-cake) and the waffle with ice cream was decent as well.  5 adults and 2 kids each with dessert and drinks, the bill came to a very moderate $55 and some change which is super reasonable.  Can't complain about that.

What really threw me off about this place was the atmosphere and other patrons.  It felt like I was in a time warp and was back in 1985 in a cafe in Seoul somewhere.  Other tables were occupied by a group of older Korean ladies gossiping away in Korean and another table occupied by a younger crowd who had issues keeping their conversation at a decent decibel.  It's really too bad because with the type of service and value we received, I really wanted to like this place.  Alas, the technicolor disco ball and the noisy Korean conversations will probably keep me from returning here, even if I were ever back in this sleepy mall."}
{"text":"Food tastes great, but waited 30 min for an omelette. Ask how long the wait time is before ordering."}
{"text":"2.5

Pros:
Lots of breakfast items to choose from
Friendly service

Cons:
Food is so so at best

I've spotted this place several times in the past.  We had to drop by No Frills on a  Saturday morning and decided to finally give it a try.  The place has a very laid back and friendly atmosphere.  There's also a good amount of seating.  It's really more a cafe with breakfast items if you ask me.

This place has a lot of breakfast dishes to choose from.  The menu has all of them pictured too which is nice.  It's also run by Koreans so there are some Korean desserts available as well.  I ordered the DC breakfast special and my GF got the French toast breakfast.  There were only two ladies working at the time so it did take a little bit for the food to arrive.  I can imagine if it were super busy, the wait could of been longer.

The food here is pretty average and nothing to write home about.  If you've ever been to the little food court at Finch station, you will know exactly what I'm talking about here.  There's a place that does a $5.50 breakfast special that's the exact kind of taste you will find here.  It's just more pricey here.  I was a little disappointed by the amount of home fries I got.  The picture on the menu showed a decent amount and I got just 4.  They were the best part of the meal which made me all the more sad.

The service is what I liked the best.  The two ladies working were both very friendly.  We ordered a glass of milk for our little one and they inquired if it was for her or not.  They put the milk in the plastic cup reserved for iced coffee drinks with a straw to make it easier and more enjoyable for her.

Dolce Camerata is a not bad option for a breakfast if your in the area.  The food isn't the best but if you're into the friendly atmosphere, it's a decent try."}
{"text":"I had the fruit crepe & asked for them without whipped cream since I'm lactose intolerant. The crepe was mediocre & I couldn't even see any chocolate sauce inside so I asked for more on top. The chocolate sauce didn't even taste like chocolate. Not sure I would want to eat here again. It's too bad because the cafe itself looks fine. It's clean, well kept with a small outdoor patio too. I noticed though that many seats were empty and after their meal people were just sitting around for a long time. A large group was already finished eating when we'd come in and were still there after we left almost an hour later.So seat turn over isn't fast."}
{"text":"Dolce Camerata is a few of the nicer places at Centerpoint Mall to chill. 

Drinking Americano from a mug listening to Classical/Spa like music on their patio is quite relaxing.  

Dufflets pastries is available if you want some sweet.  DC also has freshly made crepes or sandwiches too.... Even my favourite Banana Nutella. 

Barista is polite....asked me if I need milk for my Americano ($1.79)....with my answer being no, filled the hot water up to the top.. not to my liking!

Free WiFi just ask for the password!

Excellent hours opens from 7:30 am to 11 pm"}
{"text":"Dolce Camerato - a sweet room or may refer to sweet music.  Since it's a cafe with sweets, let's go with the former.

I'm not that big on sweets so it only makes sense to go there for breakfast - I know, doesn't make sense but just go with me on this ... OK?  Thanks.

Since I no longer go to Pickle Barrel for breakfast in central Yonge and Steeles, I've been looking for a breakfast spot.  I would like to say that I found my spot but overall, it's A-OK at best.

We ordered a few items, a breakfast combo with eggs/bacon/sausage and toast, a western sandwich, and a latte.  Also added the coffee to each of the meal for another $1.

The coffee is your standard drip coffee from a me-too brand.  Weak and not worth going for a second cup.  The latte was better but nothing to rave about.

The breakfast was ok - the sausage needed a bit more time on the griddle.  The western sandwich could use a bit more something to keep it moist or maybe the omelette was a bit dry from over cooking.

Though it was not my kind of breakfast, it seemed to be OK with other diners as there was a steady flow of people.

For those who want to find this place, it's at the mall entrance that is sandwiched between the No Frills and Congee Queen.  Since it is at the Centrepoint Mall, there is plenty of parking.

During fairer weather, it might be a good place to hang out and people watch with a drink or a dessert as I spied a little patio.  Maybe I'll give it another go at another time.

Cheers."}
