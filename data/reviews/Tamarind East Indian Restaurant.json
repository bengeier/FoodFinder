{"text":"OMG, I love this place! The food is cooked very well, not too oily or greasy and the service is fabulous - Just wish there was more seating...oh and I like the decor as well..."}
{"text":"Excellent place to dine in...Great ambience and good service. I was there on a Sunday evening. The place was fully crowded. We got seated immediately. After a long wait someone asked \" are you ready to order..?\" Where is the menu boss... Our  appetizers got served..wow the best kababs in town. . But the chicken samosa was pathetic. . I just ate the outer layer.. Main course :  Curries have real flavour and taste. Nana bread cooked to perfect..Briyani was a disaster. .. never ever try that..  But overall deserves a big round of applause. .."}
{"text":"Oh Tikka Masala how I love thee. Your spicy attitude and smoky undertones are like a party in my mouth! The butter chicken is heavenly and their samosas are deliciously authentic.  You know you have had really good Indian food when you end up in a sleepy trance exactly one hour later. You will find good food here and perhaps some sweet slumber later on.  Great atmosphere and decor, lends itself nicely for a date night or birthday celebrations. Take out available and delivery via JustEat.ca.  Good find for is NW folk who need some yummy eats."}
{"text":"Interior of the restaurant is very nice, customer service is friendly, prices are average for indian (12-15/entree)  Butter Chicken - yummm! as always.  Lamb Vindaloo - spicy but delicious. Always one of my must-haves.   Sweet & sour eggplant - I wondered about the name too, sounded like sugary Chinese food but it is actually a great dish made with a ginger and coconut sauce. It was the same one Kent V. ordered and will probably one of my future regular orders.   All the wonderful food, and they disappointed me with the naan. It tasted delicious. Just when I order naan, I order LOTS of naan. We ordered 3 orders at $1.95 each, and we got 3 medium sized pieces :( Yes I almost cried when I opened up the take-out bag and saw the limited amount of naan. All 3 orders were equivalent of 1 or 1.5 orders at another restaurant. They crushed my most important part of the meal by having ridiculously overpriced naan.   I debated 3 stars, but others may not care about swimming in naan like I do, so I'll give it 4, and see how it goes next time."}
{"text":"Something is missing in spices. Food taste different then the last time we dined in. Service was fabulous though. 3.5 star if I had option."}
{"text":"This is our fourth time here and we have always enjoyed the meal.   For being in a residential neighbourhood, the food is fairly authentic.  The pomegranate martini is especially tasty.  Recommended for anyone looking for good local Indian food."}
{"text":"This is my favourite indian restaurant in Calgary.  I have been multiple times and the food and service have always been great.    I normally order the butter chicken with coconut rice and garlic naan bread.  The butter chicken has some sweetness which is exactly how I like it.  The samosas are some of the best I have had but they are a bit spicy.    It is a small restaurant but the decor is very nice and modern.  I normally go for dinner on weekends and though the restaurant gets busy, I have never had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"The ambiance and decor of this restaurant is one of the loveliest in Calgary. We ordered a variety of dishes and each one was unique in its flavours and freshness. The kebabs were delicious and had just the right hint of spices and herbs. We also ordered the paneer and garlic naan, which were both delicious. And the mango lassi is just to die for! The service was prompt and helpful, with efficient staff. I would definitely say that this is a great place to have in the NW, so glad to have found it right in our own backyard! Recommend to anyone that enjoys good food period."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to rate this restaurant 2 stars, the food has always been fresh and lots of flavour, and consistent, as well as good service. But this it the second time we ordered take out and found a long black hair in our food, we will not go back here again."}
{"text":"Worst service possible!   Great food but outweighed by the terrible service.     Showed up, there was a line so we spoke to the male seating tables. He said it will be ten minutes and never took our name.  15 minutes later he then said it will be about 10-20 minutes.  Other patrons came in and he took their names.  We asked him and he said well you didn't give me your name even though we checked in twice.  He then said another ten minutes. All in all we stood there for 30 minutes and he denied it and tried to add our name to his list behind other patrons.    Good luck!"}
{"text":"We went to Tamarind for my husband's birthday as we both were craving good Indian food. Well, I have to say that it's a hidden gem in the NW corner of the city. The décor is nice and modern and will surely come under the fine dining category. The prices are not too bad as compared to other Indian restaurants in the town. The servers were warm and friendly. I had Paneer Tikka- yummy, Samosa- not so good, Veggie tikki- Awesome, Papdi chaat- yummy. In the maincourse I had tried Eggplant bharta- awesome, Paneer lababdar- Really good, Biryani- Not the authentic one but still very good. Lachha parathas were nice and yummy too. So, all in all I had a great experience there and cannot wait to go there again. I highly recommend the place."}
{"text":"We've eaten in the restaurant 3 times, but we usually get the takeout. This is a solid Indian restaurant I've recommended to many folks.  All of the following are good... Popodum, Vegetable pakora (fave) Tandoori chicken, spicy chicken tikka, butter chicken (although not the 'best' I've had), Shahi paneer, Lamb korma (fave), coconut rice (fave) naan...  The food is very flavourful, better than most Indian I've had. Unfortunately one of my faves is no longer on the menu - Kheer, or Indian rice pudding. Damn! It's purely delicious comfort food.  Remember to order less than you think you'll need because it's very filling - especially if you are using the naan or rice to soak up the sauces.  The veggie pakoras are great next day snacks as we discovered on a recent road trip.  Food: 9/10 Service: 8/10 Atmosphere: 7/10  Question:  Why is Indian food so filling? An hour after I eat I feel like I will slip into a food coma."}
{"text":"I've become a regular at this place. Being an Indian who knows and loves food that is saying a lot! Most restaurants try to pass off anything as Indian food by throwing on a bucketload of spices. Tamarind is the exception. The food is flavorful, with the right amount of heat. The kebabs and tandoori items are excellent, probably the best in town. So are the various chicken dishes. Lamb tends to be a bit of a hit and miss though."}
{"text":"My friends and I have had dinner here on numerous occasions and always enjoyed ourselves. The food is always fresh and delicious!  The naan tastes and looks like it is homemade and very fresh.   I love that we never feel rushed here. The atmosphere is relaxing (nice music) they do not rush you through your meal.  The waiter overheard that we were celebrating a birthday and brought a specialty cocktail as a surprise!  How sweet is that?"}
{"text":"I have eaten here multiple times. The atmosphere is classy and the staff are friendly. The butter chicken and aloo gobi are my favorites! Wifey likes the Tammarnd rice but my fav is the peas pulao. If you're in the area, I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. We've been ordering from them for a couple of years now. Food is always delicious and service is always very friendly. We've never eaten in the restaurant (always takeout) but the ambiance is really nice. Casual yet refined.  The beef samosas are my favourite. Outstanding."}
{"text":"Placed a large group order for pickup six hours in advance...arrived at the Restaurant six hours later for pickup and they had lost my order.  I complained to the Manager/Owner and he said it wasn't his problem and said I should've called before coming to pick it up...will never go here."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! !! Great service very friendly!! The Coconut chicken and Chicken chow me in is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Decent food, good ambiance, Below average service.   Place is too far from the city and a long drive from downtown."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Indian restaurant in the city. I usually prefer dark meat but the chicken breast they use in their chicken dishes are amazingly tender. The prawn malai curry is also a must have when I go."}
{"text":"I really love eating Indian food and for what it's worth, the food here was decent which is why I have 2 stars instead of 1. The customer service was HORRIBLE. Very inexperienced / undertrained people working here. I would highly recommend the manager/owner to hire and train new people who actually LIKE customer service. The people working seem like they absolutely hate their jobs. Will not be returning to this restaurant for these reasons."}
{"text":"Service is really poor here.I tried Avocado Chicken and really not something you go to an Indian restaurant  to eat.i also tried Butter chicken also but was not happy either.i will not recommend  anyone to go waste your money."}
{"text":"Tonight was the first time we ate at Tamarind in about 18 months, prior to tonight we have enjoyed the food many, many times, but that is until tonight. This is not the same food that kept us coming back previously, and certainly NOT authentic Indian food. Ordered a vindaloo and butter chicken, it wasn't even remotely close in taste or texture. Both the butter chicken and vindaloo were a grossly overly  tomato concoction, neither \"dish\" came close, butter chicken wasn't the creamy delight and vindaloo was terrible and not even the least bit spicy. I have personally enjoyed Indian food all over Canada (Vancouver, Calgary and Toronto), in London UK, and right in Mumbai India, so I think I have the pallet to know good food from bad, and unfortunately this really wasn't good at all.   We really enjoyed Tamarind in the past, but either the chief has left the building or different ownership has changed the menu altogether. Very disappointing. If you want authentic Indian in Calgary go to Mango Shiva or Glory of India downtown."}
{"text":"We have eaten a few times here and the service has been good with excellent food.  After tonight however we feel the staff need some hospitality 101 training.  We were seated after a short wait - my wife tried to order a Kingfisher beer but the waiter said it was not available and suggested a Tiger which she agreed to. I ordered a Coors and the waiter went to fetch.  He came back a little later and now said  Tiger was out too - they had just restocked and it was all warm. Now disappointed, my wife opted for no beer.  Just after waiter left - behind us we noticed that a table received three Tiger beers. The same table that was seated and ordered drinks after us.   As we were waiting to give our order, a table was being cleared next to us. A napkin with utensils was left on the table from the previous guests with the fork was on top. Instead of taking everything away (the smart thing in case fork was used) the staff just tucked it back into the napkin and put down a new plate. That is a H&S no no.  Food arrived - we ordered a platter for two and two other dishes medium spiced. They were all very tasty but the dishes were NOT medium - they were only mild.  Finally - icing on the cake on hospitality disasters - when we got the bill - the Tiger was on it. Really? You screw up finding my wife a beer - a good restaurant would of given her a free one and apologized for messing up. But no. And then you charge for something we didn't order.  So no - we're not going back. Food is good but I think we\"ll take our business elsewhere.  This restaurant needs hospitality work and now has questionable food safety standards."}
{"text":"My buddy and I ate here on Saturday night.  It's wise to book a reservation as it does seem to fill up around 6PM.  The woman I spoke to on the phone for reservations was friendly and upbeat, and the server who may have been the same woman served well.   We ordered the following dishes: Spiced Beef Samosas $4.99 - These samosas were decent, cut in half when served.  Coconut Chicken $13.95 - Great tasting sauce and moist chicken pieces, my fave.   Beef Vindaloo $13.95 - Cube beef pieces in a tangy sauce.   Coconut Rice $3.95  - Good tasting rice, a bit bias as I am a fan of coconut.  Garlic Naan $2.50 - Good tasting soft bread that was lightly buttered with garlic.  I found the dishes to be pricey, with a smaller quantity than I would have liked, however the quality of the dish is important, so I would return to Tamarind in order to try some more dishes."}
{"text":"Great food. Servers were nice and cordial and did a great job of making us feel welcome. Food is a fusion of Indo Chinese"}
{"text":"Best take out we've had for Indian food in years. The pakoras were fantastic and all the curries flavorful and fresh tasting.  Looking forward to ordering some different dishes here again soon."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the city.  The pakora trio is a great way to start and you really can't go wrong with any curry you pick on the menu. They are all flavourful and delicious. Try the tamarind rice it's incomparable. I will drive all the way across the city to have this curry. Only suggestion would be to check on the bathrooms a bit more as they need some servicing."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and both times were amazing.  the perfect blend of spices for each dish.  we had butter chicken, rogen josh, and some pakoras.  the garlic naan bread is cooked properly so it feels gooey but a perfect mix with the sauces as dips.  I recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Places like Tamarind make me want to move to Canada - just for the food. The décor was so impressive, modern fixtures and calming Buddha statues. Spinach tikki - OH MY GOD! Simply the best appetizer I have ever had. Their chef is a genius, to be able to expertly marry the flavors of spinach, goat cheese and fry it to perfection - it was crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside. Even the pairing with their chutneys and coleslaw (yeah, who would think a spinach patty could go well with coleslaw!) worked so well. We also ordered their Chowmein noodles; we had low expectations for that with Tamarind being a North Indian place, but even that blew us away. The noodles were a perfect blend of indo-Chinese with lots of vegetables. I also ordered the malai kofta and garlic naan, which were much better than what I get in the USA. The owner and waitress were both very friendly, they talked to us about our trip, helped us find local places and also packed our left overs for us. That kind of service is unheard of in the US. The prices were very reasonable for a full service restaurant, in US you would eat in foil or Styrofoam for these prices. I wish I stayed in Calgary so I could come back here again and again."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING!  We brought our in-laws for dinner here!  We were lucky to come at the right time as this place was full!  The staff were excellent!  Never had to wait for anything and the food was probably the best I have had in a long time!  We will definitely be back!  YUM!"}
{"text":"Pretty delicious place! Better than what I've tasted in Toronto! The lamb dishes are amazing.. the butter chicken sauce is not quite comparable to Bricklane's Indian cuisine in the UK  however, but still delicious."}
{"text":"The service and the food are awesome here. Dishes are tailored to your spiciness. My favourites are Aloo Gobi and Prawn Malai Curry with a side of count rice. And don't forget the nan. This is a place were you can close your eyes and enjoy all the flavours."}
{"text":"In a word, wow!  We were seated right away and the service was stellar right from the get go.  We ordered a combo platter called the Pikor Trio, and all three items were delicious, but back to the service for now.  Our hostess also doubled as our waitress, so she immediately knew we needed service and got to us quickly.  We got our drink orders right away.  Our appetizer came in about ten minutes, which is rather quick judging by the standard of my experience.  Another ten minutes and our main course was out.  I had the prawn malai, and it was fantastic.  My fiancee had dahl, which she said was good for dahl.   I'd have cleaned my plate if it wasn't so filling.  This may have been a function of the amount of naan we got.  We asked for four orders of naan between the two of us, because we are accustomed to relatively small portions at Green Chili, another nice Indian place.  The portions at Tamarind are so generous that we thought they had accidentally brought us eight, and their naan is to die for!  The decor was breathtaking.  There was impressive brick work on the walls, chandeliers with patterned metal shades, a giant Buddha and high ceilings.  It's typical of what you might find at a far more expensive place.  So with this raving review, why did I only give four stars?  Well because I couldn't wait to get out of there, and neither could my fiancee.  They had some sort of problem with their heat system and the entire time we were there we couldn't take our jackets off.  I will update and give them five stars if we go back and their heat works.  To be fair it worked a little, just not at peak efficiency for some reason.   It was cold but not bitter."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, well dressed staff and low lighting. Good idea for a date night change. I took take out though so most of my review is based on the food itself. The food wasn't particularly spicy but was ok. I did order butter chicken and goat vindaloo and I think both were a 4/5. I got the bread basket because I love the naan bread. It's was kind of pricey I thought at 8 bucks or so,  but I had to order it because it didn't come with rice. I thought it was kind of a cheap blow to not have it come with rice, it should be priced into the meal I think. That is the only reason it's a three star for me, because it wasn't slot of meat in the food, and having to pay for the rice. (Raj palace throws in a small bowl) Ultimately, it's worth a try, but I think the atmosphere is what you should go for. Good place to bring your date if you are tired of the same old same old."}
{"text":"Review #5 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012.  Food: 4/5 Atmosphere: 5/5 Service: 3.5/5 Overall experience: 4/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  I don't really like Indian food and I rarely go out to eat it, but Tamarind changed my mind completely. It was the most delicious and flavourful Indian food I have ever had.  Tamarind is an upscale Indian restaurant with a sophisticated decor like Mango Shiva. You wouldn't have known this was an Indian restaurant until you take a whiff of the beautiful curry spices wafting in the air. It is fairly small and although I went on a Sunday night, the restaurant was full by 6pm-7pm.  Our server was pretty good. He asked us if we wanted drinks right when we sat down and took our order in a timely manner. My friends and I ordered a variety of dishes to share and I appreciated how he read back our order to make sure it was correct. The food came out all at once in about 15-20 minutes. I'm not sure if I can say the same if it was during dinner rush.  Their menu is nothing you haven't seen before at an Indian restaurant. Curries are around $10-$15 which is fairly cheap compared to other Indian restaurants in Calgary. On the other hand, the dishes are a smaller portion, but if you order 1 dish per person and share amongst yourselves you will guaranteed be full.  Overall, the food was amazing! The Indian flavours of the curry were mild so nothing was overly spicy; but it was still seasoned very well. I noticed that the curries we got were fairly thick which I prefer since I can easily sop it up with my naan bread or meld into my rice.  My friends and I ordered the:  - \"Sweet and Sour Eggplant\" ($10.95), with roasted Eggplant, Tamarind ginger and coconut curry. This is the restaurant's specialty dish. The eggplant was super tender, wasn't too oily, and the flavours were blended together well. Would recommend for a vegetarian dish.  - \"Butter Chicken\" ($12.95) and \"Chicken Tikka Masala\" ($12.95). The chicken pieces were extremely moist and tender which almost never happens whenever I get a chicken dish. It was like eating a cube of butter. The tikka masala had a thick curry with large chicken chunks and bell peppers. The butter chicken was the highlight of the meal with a killer creamy sauce. It wasn't too heavy and tasted amazing with the coconut rice. Although both chicken dishes were good I highly recommend the butter chicken.  - \"Palak Saag Lamb\" ($ 11.95) with creamy spinach and marinated lamb. Wasn't as good as the other dishes.   For sides we got:   - Garlic Naan ($2.50). We got two orders which gives each person 1.5 ample pieces. The bread was soft, chewy, and lightly buttered with garlic.   - You MUST GET the \"Coconut Rice\" ($3.95) with the curries! It is the best coconut rice I've ever had. You can really taste the coconut flavour and the addition of shredded coconut was what knocked it out of the ballpark.   We finished our meal off with their \"Gulab Jaman\" ($3.95) dessert which is a spongy cake mound sopped in sugar syrup and served with vanilla ice cream. A guilty yet pleasurable way to end a meal! Perfect to share since it comes with two small rounds.  Coming from someone who doesn't like Indian food, I highly recommend Tamarind. I loved every single bite of my meal and I would definitely come back to try their other curries."}
{"text":"A friend of mine referred this restaurant to us - she said that she had the best birthday meal here recently. I am so glad she told us about it as I am not sure we would have found it soon enough! (tucked into the end of a strip mall) Family owned and derived from authentic East Indian recipes.  We arrived here on a Friday night at 6pm and got a seat no problem. Let me tell you though, a half hour makes the difference as it was packed by 630pm. The restaurant is beautifully decorated; dark wood, interesting modern lighting and comfortable seating. It also has a variety of edgy music playing. Supposedly, they switch it up and do play Indian music at times which I believe I would have loved. Tonight was a mixed Pitbull CD!  I would say in the evenings anyways, the crowd is arguably adult.  The room was quite chilly upon entry so the extra bodies that came to dine were most welcome!  That aside, the service was great as was the FOOD!  We ordered the chicken tikka masla as well as the butter chicken (extra spicy). We also ordered the OH-SO-GOOD garlic naan bread and the irresistible coconut rice. My hubby had a beer and I tried the hot chai tea which takes extra time as it is made from scratch. The tea was honestly just OK. The mains were quite good and we could not eat all of it so the portions to me, were decent. The butter chicken was sweet and luscious. How do they get the chicken cubed up so perfectly square? Extra green chiles were brought out to me so I could kick up the heat factor even more. The tikka was not quite as saucy for sopping up with the naan bread but I enjoyed the onion and peppers that were mixed into the dish. I did not find anything spicy but I am a fire breather. They will adjust seasoning for you, you just have to ask. I wished there were more shrimp dishes and maybe a nice hot tea (other than chai) but did not see any on the menu. We had to skip dessert but there are some sweet offerings!  All this was $46 before tip. I was pleasantly surprised to see the bill as it was a lot of food!"}
{"text":"Snowy Calgary evening, looking for some spicy comfort food in a place that was not too noisy. Tried the local pub, much too busy. So we walked over to the Tamarind. Looked a bit dark from the side, but my daughter having been there at lunch pointed me in the right direction.  Very contemporary inside. Lovely decor and friendly staff. We were seated quickly and our drinks arrived in short order. The menu looks traditional indian but the presentation is not. Very elegant samozas sliced for sharing. The eggplant was superb in a very flavorful tomato sauce. The beef kabob, spicy with cumin, delicious. Garlic nan bread was so good. And we had THE desert.... Yummy. I was full and enjoyed all the flavours.    Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"agree with the review below that stated the time issue with pick-up orders. My friend had ordered and found the same issue (time delay of 20 mins.). But the food was fantastic - amritsari macchi were tender flaky morsels of fish with a crispy reddish exterior. The mint sauce really accentuated the spices. The butter chicken, lamb korma, and palak paneer were each delicious, good cuts of meat or in the case of paneer, cubes of cheese (and didn't taste all same - like Green Chili). Creamy sauces were mopped up airy naan and soaked in rice (both plain and tamarind rice - the tamarind rice was studded with peas that still tasted sweet. My friend told she has ordered several times - and its only great if the mom is cooking in the kitchen. When she's not cooking - all the food taste the same. Personally, I don't mind waiting for food as long as it tastes as good as it did. Worth the wait. This is high quality food at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"After a long time I was truly happy with an Indian Restaurent. Everything was just great. First impression walking into the place was just great. Ambient, elegantly decorated with buddha and modern designs. Lighting is just perfect. Service was great.  We were asked few times if we needed anything and never let our glasses get to less than 1/3 of water.  Every dishes we ordered were delicious and on point. We had Butter chicken which actually was so creamy, little sweet and chicken were moist. Their malai Prawns had very nice aroma, it was creamy delicious. Our favorite on the table was sweet and sour Eggplant. It was just perfect as I imagined from the description. Perfect balance of taste. It had enough sauce to eat with naan or rice. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Tastes fantastic but service is not the best.  Next time I think I'd just go for their take out.  Delicious though. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find. The food was wonderful and the prices very reasonable. The wonderful Alana (not sure of the spelling..sorry) made the evening even better. I would not hesitate to recommend or return."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favourite places for Indian food because the food is great and the place is relatively close to my place in the NW but the last time I visited, the service was so horrible that I will definitely have to find a new regular Indian place.   The previous time we visited, we had a lovely server (I'm sorry, I really can't remember her name because I am so horrible with names) who recommended some dishes we've never tried before. One of the dishes were tilapia, which we LOVED. Remembering how good it was, we called in to order some food for pick up.   When I called, I spoke to a guy who was downright rude and condescending. I asked if they have a fish dish with tilapia as I couldn't remember the name of the dish and he talked to me as if I was stupid and said there was no such fish on the menu. I thought perhaps I just mixed up the names, so I asked him to recommend a different dish and went to pick up.   As I was waiting for the food when I got to the restaurant, I checked the menu to see what the dish I had last time was. The menu clearly said tilapia!!! When I mentioned it to the hostess, the guy stormed over and argued with me, saying that the menu was outdated and that he does all the orders for the inventory, and that he hasn't ordered tilapia for months because it's too expensive.   I understand that customers make mistakes. And I understand that your menu is outdated. Yes I understand that you are the manager or assistant manager or whatever high horse you are riding on, but talking down to a customer and arguing that they are wrong is clearly not the right way to run a customer service oriented job and business. He made me feel stupid and not welcomed at all, when I was there to pick up 60$ of take out food as I regularly do.   I used to frequent this place and take many of my friends there, but I haven't visited since my last unpleasant pick up order and do not plan to again. So, if anyone has a recommendation for a great Indian restaurant, this girl right here is looking for a new fav place."}
{"text":"I let the owner know I was dissatisfied with the time to get my food and he tell me \"then don't come back.\"  I scheduled a pick up for food at Tamarind Indian Restaurant in Panorama Hills. I called at 4:10 and told them I would pick up at 5:15. That seemed like lots of time to me to make four dishes and some naan bread.  We got there exactly at 5:15. We were heading to my mom's house so my wife and infant child sat in the car. I thought \"great, perfect timing.\" I meet the owner and tell him that I'm waiting for pickup. As he takes my credit card to pay, he and I talk cordially about how I like the food and how I've referred a lot of friends there. He says the food will come out right soon. Soon to me is less than 5 minutes.  So I waited and waited. My wife and child are sitting in the car as I wait. Nothing happens, other people get their food. It's now 5:37 and I'm pissed off.  So I approach the owner and tell him that I ordered at 4:10 for pickup at 5:15. My wife and kid are sitting in the car waiting and I don't see my meal nearly 25 mins later. I said everything very respectfully so I didn't expect him be get defensive. He did: 1.) He tries to correct me \"it's only 5:35.\" That's still 20 mins late. 2.) He says that I ordered for pick up at 5:30. I tell him no, I know exactly when I said I would be here. 3.) He tells me that they care more for the quality of food. I say that as his customer, I'm looking for the whole customer experiance. That includes whether they can serve me on time.  At this point, he says \"well, don't come back.\" I'm taken aback by this comment. I say, \"are you serious?\" He repeats, \"Yeah, if you don't like it, don't come back.\""}
{"text":"Found my way into this place because it was close to where we picked up our engagement photos and I've quite pleased to have found this place indeed!  A worthy note from my discriminating Indian palate - this seems to be heavily westernized and not overly authentic (my favorite) but it's still darn tasty.   You'll see other reviews that talk about it being \"the only Indian food I've ever liked\" and I think that's because it's inspired food creations for the most part that appeal to the western masses. The crowd we dined with kind of helps reinforce my point.   The food here is not cheap - but on par with many of the NW places you'll find good Indian food at so I wouldn't say that's a problem.  The menu if heavily meat focused (again - it's westernized over authentic) and I found the veggie options to be very basic with nothing to excitingly different that would really set them apart that way.  The creativity was in the meat dishes for sure.   We ordered a pakora trio (not my favorite authentic appitizer) but what we got was very good.  One was full of cheese, another was made of spinach and the 3rd was a bit more traditional.   It was presented in a style I would consider french or Italian  - Indian food doesn't seem to be known for it's presentation!  Naan was delicious.   My dahl was wonderful - even though it was \"just\" dahl.   Service was excellent even though I don't think anyone there was very experienced servers,  I think they picked the best of the newbies in this regard and everyone tried really hard.   I love the decor - they did a fabulous job in this area.   Over all I would go back here - it's a bit far and out of the way from me though which is a bit sad but I'll find my way back there.   Review 15 of 30 in Yelp's 30 Day Challenge - half way there!"}
{"text":"This place looks great inside and the food is just as amazing. Genuine owners who truly want to serve genuine beautifully made dishes.   Peek in the kitchen and their spice rack!"}
{"text":"Great place for Indian food! Highly recommended. The service is also amazing.   We had the Zesty Martini to start. It was pretty good. The ginger and pineapple together were an odd combination  For dinner we had the butter chicken, beef korma, and mattar paneer. All was so tasty. Especially the Korma. The beef was so tender.  The butter chicken had a bit of a tomato taste though which was different.   Get the garlic naan bread!!!!! Soon good!"}
{"text":"Night out to catch up with a friend and we'd already left a place for being smoky and having too-tall uncomfortable chairs.  We were hangry and neither of us know the area well.  But...Yelp pulled off another win!  The Aloo Tikki to start: pillowy potato splodges of deliciousness, covered with art-deco streaks of chutney and sauce.  Appealing to the eye and tongue!  The Chicken Korma dish on the menu wasn't available but they subbed a tasty one in and both the Beef Rogan Josh and Pudine Wala Paneer were perfectly balanced spice creations and heartily satisfying.    Rice and Naan are like the triangles or maracas to an orchestra - they can either compliment beautifully or stand out and wreck the entire arrangement.  Here, they were the perfect addition.  I can't remember the name of my cocktail but I know it had ginger beer, rum and a variety of other delights.  It was a sensory vacation.  Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, had an endearing pride of the establishment and was (if this matters to you) handsome with piercing blue eyes (wink).  The portions were enough that we took some home.  I am only taking one star off because I am used to paying less for Indian food where I live.  But, honestly I will gladly return here for the quality of food & presentation and look forward to trying more dishes."}
{"text":"I've never been a big fan of Indian Cuisine since I've tried it a couple of years ago, but my wife and friends have always loved it.  We decided to give Tamarind a try when it first opened up.    Wow!  What a different from the other Indian Restaurants I've tried.  We've been here a few times now and so far everything we've ordered was very yummy.  The service is excellent and the prices are reasonable.    This is our favourite place for Indian Cuisine."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and the people are so awesome. We got here very late on a Sunday night, right before closing and despite this they seated seated us without any hesitation. We easily spent an hour and a half here and not once did we feel rushed. Paneer malai tandoori, malai kofta, paneer butter, lacha paratha, and naan. All excellent and very authentic. This place really made a great end end to our trip."}
{"text":"very good homemade tasting north indian.  The pakoras, butter chicken and naans are up there with the best.  The fusion dishes are quite interesting"}
{"text":"Living in the suburbs, it is often difficult to find a really good  restaurant. We typically don't get much beyond chain restaurants so when Tamarind opened a number of years ago we were thrilled to finally have a truly great restaurant in the area serving amazing food. Unfortunately something has happened lately (new management/owners) and some of our go to staples aren't nearly as good as they once were. Most recently we ordered the Sweet and Sour Eggplant and it was decidedly different, noticeably less flavour and not nearly as creamy as it used to be. The garlic naan was essentially the same but the coconut rice was also lacking. The Butter Chicken was still pretty good but I did not think it was \"amazing\" as we had almost always previously described it. Very disappointed :("}
{"text":"A really great Indian restaurant...best in the city \"Hands Down\"!  We've tried them all, and i would definitely say i've never been disappointed here.   I believe it's a family run restaurant with really authentic tasting food.  We ordered a number of different dishes, including their sampler platter so we had an opportunity to try a bit of everything.  My wife and i always seem to order too much, but it all looks so good....we've enjoyed everything so far....no disappointments!    It's safe to say it's good for the whole family... our kids can be quite picky when it comes to different flavours and foods...but they loved it!  From all the flavours of Naan bread to their meals, they had no complaints.   Our servers have always been super friendly and made some good recommendations that our kids loved.  This is our go to place and a super convenient location!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Ordered take out, they forgot to pack the rice. When I drove back to ask for the missing item they didn't even bother to apologize.   Food was Okey. I ordered butter chicken, and chicken biryani. The quality is way worse than what you can get in Raj Place or taste of india. I will never go back."}
{"text":"It's my new favourite Indian food restaurant, I love the food and the atmosphere, the service is good but I gave it only 4 stars because we had to wait too long for the food to come. I recommend the vegetable samosa and butter chicken, the nan is great too. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Found this spot when we where going for sushi next door and as I'm a lover of Indian cusine had to come back and try it.  Well, tried and I have to say one of the best Indian restaurants I've found.  The service is spot on and very friendly.  The decor is also very appealing and comfortable.  The menu is easy to read and understand with many chioices.  The food comes out hot and the flavors are amazing, the naan is fresh and just perfect to compliment the butter chicken.  I have been here many times and even on my birthday and they surprised me with an appitizer that I had never tried and may not have if they had not introduced me to it.  I can't remember the dish at the moment but I 've never had a bad meal here, great authentic Indian food.  You have to try thier mango lassie it's thick and creamy and goes so well with the spice of the food.  If your looking for good Indian food and great atmoshphere then this is the place."}
{"text":"This is a top notch Indian restaurant.  Paneer is made in house and has a wonderful texture and taste.  Their food is plated wonderfully, so that it looks like art.  Also the flavors of the food are well balanced.  Have been to the restaurant many times as a local, and never have been disappointed with the food or service.   I was not feeling well when I ordered take out, so the server kept brining me water.  Now that is going above and beyond the normal service standards!  This is a restaurant that I personally recommend to those that love Indian food."}
{"text":"The decor is very nice. I have been here multiple times and I have yet to have a bad meal.   Portions encourages sharing. Easily accommodates larger parties."}
{"text":"Felt like butter chicken but didn't want to drive too far so decided to check out Tamarind.  We ordered our usual EI course consisting of popodum, onion bahji, butter chicken, chicken korma, curry veg & rice.    Even though we had it to go a few things about the restaurant.  Its in a new strip mall and offers decent parking.  The interior is quite nice and tastefully decorated which would be appropriate for anything from a dinner with the kids to date night.  The person who took my order and served me when picking up was very friendly and seemed to care about providing good service.    Now back to the food!  The popodums themselves were good but nothing special (how can you make a deep fried cracker special??) but the chutneys served with it were fantastic.  In particular the papaya was very refreshing.  The bahji were nicely spiced and were fresh, good bite sized lumps of oniony goodness.  The butter chicken and chicken korma were both well prepared with enough spice to give a kick but not over powering.  The curry veg had a good selection of different vegetables and also freshly prepared.  A nice surprise is they offered coconut rice.  While not as strong as thai coconut rice it was still very good."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner as a last minute decision, and absolutely loved it! I've only visited a handful of East Indian restaurants to date, and this establishment is the best one so far. The food was delicious and staff very friendly. Our server was mindful and personable, making us feel very welcomed. I highly recommend their coconut curry!"}
{"text":"Grabbed take out for lunch here the other day and was pleasantly surprised with how fresh the food was, how great it tasted and it wasn't oily or greasy at all.   We ordered the Aloo Gobi, Sweet and Sour Eggplant, Tamarind Rice and Roti - came to $32.29 including taxes and they provided some plates and cutlery to go.   My favorite Indian place in Calgary so far has been Moti Mahal, but we're moving to Panorama and are so thrilled that Tamarind is right down the street. It's definitely going to be our go to Indian place now. I love that they have several different dishes and not just the same old items everyone else has.   I also highly recommend the sweet and sour eggplant! It's eggplant pieces cooked in a tamarind tomato saucey curry. So delicious :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! It has an amazing selection of plates to choose from and everything I've tried has fresh and bright flavors. (nothing out of a jar). I've tried a lot of Indian restaurants in Calgary and this place is a gem. I suggest their beef naan, butter chicken (request it spicy), paneer in cashew sauce and dahl. If you eat in they have a nicely decorated location that is clean and hip. The staff has always been friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"We visited this place from Bay Area (hub of Indian food in USA). We viait s Banff and Jasper and on way back went to this place for dinner.   Decorum is great. Quick to get place around 8.30pm. Hospitality is really good.  We ordered chicken Naan, roti and Prawns Malai curry. It's good enough to share for 2 people. Amazing flavors. Authentic Indian spices and fresh fish. Would recommend this hidden gem to people."}
{"text":"Hands down the best tasting Indian restaurant in our area would have been 5 stars if the meat portions in the dishes where better then couple chunks that they give you, pretty stingy! You always have to call skip the dishes for delivery thinking I might just have to get skip the dishes to bring me namskar for now on."}
{"text":"So after some nagging on my husbands part, we ventured out for some Indian cuisine.  He loves the stuff, I unfortunately don't.  Tamarind is in our neck of the woods and we headed out with the kids in tow and gave it a go on a Tuesday.  The space itself is lovely but quite small but considering the location, it is more catered to people who live in Panorama Hills.  The menu is extensive and there is A LOT  to choose from.  We started with a beef and veg samosa appetizer.  My husband couldn't get enough, but me and the kids found them way too spicy.  For Indian, I guess that's to be expected.   We proceeded to order our mains: butter chicken for the kids, mild of course, beef korma for myself, and hubby had the Kadhai Jhinga (spicy shrimp).  The verdict:  I thought the butter chicken was extremely rich and overly sweet tasting, so I didn't enjoy it and my little one didn't like it at all.  The beef korma was excellent but I wish there was a few more beef chunks in it, there was too much sauce and not enough beef.  If I enjoyed extreme spice, I think I would have enjoyed the shrimp more.  My husband loved it but I felt it was so spicy that you couldn't even taste the shrimp.  The best part of the meal for me was the coconut rice, garlic naan and the mango lassi.  I felt that $3.00 for 3 pieces of bread was extreme but it was delicious and I could have eaten that for dinner alone!  The mango lassi was a nice refreshing drink to cleanse the pallet after the fire.  All in all a nice restaurant but I don't think that I would go again strictly for the fact that I don't like east Indian cuisine but I am sure they got a regular client out of my husband!  A solid 3.5 stars for the quick service, and delicious naan!"}
