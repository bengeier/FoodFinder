{"text":"Where do I begin? Custom poutine has never looked so good. I opted for a regular sized poutine of the vegetarian variety, with tomatoes, roasted red pepper, goat cheese, sour cream and of course gravy. It was a little soupier than I had anticipated, but I can only blame myself for choosing so many sauces/cheeses. I just couldn't pass any of those up nor do I regret my decision. My boyfriend got a large poutine, which was basically enough to feed a family of four. And he topped his with gravy, sauteed onions, mushrooms and chicken. We were unable to finish his so we packed it up and enjoyed the rest later that night. And it was delicious! I should also note that the service at this location was impeccable, my boyfriend forgot to check off which gravy he wanted, he left that box blank, so when they brought us our dishes they also brought a soup bowl full of gravy for him, just in case, without us even asking. I just thought that was really intuitive and great customer service! All in all, I will definitely go back to this location next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"GREAT POUTINE! 
I'm a tourist so take that as it is but... this was the best poutine I've ever had! The curds were squeaky, the gravy rich and flavourful and the fries had a firmness that is often lost when compared to poutines I've had in the past. You get a surprising amount of cheese and fries for $7 and I can only imagine what you get with the large ($9). My dining buddy opted for The Montrealer ($12/$15) with smoked meat, mushrooms, grated cheese gravy and fries and topped off with a battered deep fried pickle. I stole half!
Yes it's a heart attack on a plate but would you rather go any other way?
As for me, I'm going back today for seconds."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I've been met with great service and delicious food. On both occasions the food came out promptly and The Poutineville and The Montrealer are hearty feasts all by their lonesome. 
All of the employees I've dealt with in my visits have been lovely and Costa who served me last time was great and it made the whole experience even better.

I'll definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Let me start this by saying if you're not ordering crushed potatoes, you're a mouth-breathing slob and you should ether yourself. For a restaurant so close to The Brunswick House, this place is surprisingly tasteful. The staff is really nice and helpful, would definitely recommend to anyone who doesn't want to wait in a 10 person line at Smoke's"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! As a first time visitor to Montreal, I was told to try the poutine. My friends and I checked this place and and were blown away. 

First of all, awesome name. We couldn't stop singing \"bring it on down to Poutineville!\" Like Justin Timberlake on SNL.

We loved the creative poutine varieties, and we each got a different one and tried each other's. It was hard to pick a favorite. FYI-the large is ENORMOUS. Even the small size is huge! Definitely share! Or don't... whatever makes you happy! :)

Our server was kind, but I wasn't blown away by the service we received. The vibe was very casual. Great for groups!"}
{"text":"Très bon et différent de la poutine commune grâce à tous les choix!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Quick and friendly. Decor left something to be desired, but is quickly forgotten once the plate has arrived. I tried the poutine with mashed fries, cheese grains and philly steak. The meat was excellent as were the fries. A tip that I would recommend is order extra cheese as it was a little on the skimpy side for the cheese, but meat and sauce was fine. A must try in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Quick delivery but not really good food, I've tried the poutine steak Philly, the breaded pickles and the Burger piquante and everything was average and quite expensive."}
{"text":"Ambience: 2/5
One of my coworkers recommended me this poutine joint and I finally found time to try it out. The ambience of the place kind of threw me off. It was quite dark inside. 

Food: 2/5
I ordered their special with braised beef. The beef was pretty good but it was cold and not mixed in with the fries or gravy. It took me a while to work everything in to get mixed which inadvertently cools the entire poutine. The fries were super crunchy but I also found a few that looked suspicious (mouldy-ish). 

Service: 3/5
The waiter did her job but I felt as if she was a little pushy. 

Overall: 2/5
Overall it was a pretty big disappointment for me especially when it was about $15 for just a poutine. I've had ones in Montreal for less but was much better. I will probably come back and give it another try with another item just because it might have been an off day for them."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Poutine here! 

Loved the fact that they had both pre-determined poutine concoctions or you could make it yourself and choose your toppings.  

Staff were really nice and helpful.  

Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Good poutine! I like that you can customize your order and get the best of everything. Their chicken paninis are also amazing!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Both locations in Montreal have really friendly staff and really fast service. Plus it's nice that you can choose your poutine exactly how you want it every time. The julienne fries are really delicious - highly recommended. Not only is the poutine amazing here, but I've tried a few other things on the menu and everything was really good - the BLT and the Club sandwiches. Yum!"}
{"text":"Bon mais prix élevé pour une Poutine.  Par contre, grosse portion et plusieurs sélections de Poutine."}
{"text":"Simplement, WOW. C'est rare qu'on peut manger une bonne poutine à une place aussi bien que ça. Ca ne resemble en rien au autre restaurant à poutine. 

Le service était impeccable et j'ai vraiment apprécié le menu des bières en bouteille et en fut. Bonne poutine et bon prix!"}
{"text":"You usually get the same poutine, however my Philly steak here was mind blowing and phenomenal.  Staff were super friendly, and I enjoyed chatting with them.
Their poutine is a little different then the usual, especially about the was fries are.
I absolutely recommend this place and would %100 go back.
Thanks for the best poutine in my life"}
{"text":"The best thing about poutines from Poutineville is there hand crushed potatoes. So crunchy. This is what truly distinguishes them from other poutine places like la Banquise. The texture of their potatoes are amazing. In regards to their flavours, it depends on what you get. I've had, for example, a tomato based poutine dish, and it ended up with an overwhelming pasta like flavour. Too much. On the other hand, I loved their cabane a sucre poutine during poutine week and I wish it would become a permanent part of their menu!  They also have the option of building your own poutine, though this can get s bit expensive. Must try along with la Banquise!"}
{"text":"We were on a poutine tasting tour on 4/19/2015. Part two.  We shared a poutine with smoked meat and cheese. The gravy here was much better in flavor and quality than the first location. The potatoes were crushed and held the flavors better. The smoked meat was good and better too. The cheese was melted onto the poutine instead of in cheese curd form. Overall this was the better poutine because of the quality of ingredients, flavors, and the gravy, smoked meat, and cheese were layered into the poutine so that all the potatoes had flavor, not just the top. We had a hot tea and a red ale to wash down the good stuff. The portion was good for sharing."}
{"text":"Ah Poutineville, ce restaurant récent qui a ouvert il n'y pas si longtemps. Qu'est qui a de plus que les autres restaurant de poutine? C'est simple, tu fais ta propre poutine custom. C'est-à-dire que lorsque tu commandes, tu coche sur une feuille les sortes de frites ( leur spécialité patate écrasée), les viandes, les légumes, le fromage et la sauce( j'aime bien la sauce au vin rouge). Il y a aussi pour les dur à cuire la fameuse `la crise cardiaque` ( 5 livres de frites et de garniture) . Je dirai qu'elle est meilleur que la banquise. De plus, les fois j'y suis allé ce n'était pas rempli à craquer."}
{"text":"Best place to lose my poutine virginity."}
{"text":"I got the poutine with chicken and bacon and mozzarella cheese. The meat is a bit dry. Gravy is not salty! They also don't put a lot of gravy so to me it's a plus. I didn't like the potatoes much since I thought it'd be crispier but it got a bit soggy even tho I took a bite right at the moment the waitress served it to me - and I ordered the house special. 

Awesome service tho :) very nice and friendly! 

If I crave for poutine and be in town, will definitely visit!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic, very glad we came to Montreal. We wanted authentic Poutine, we came to the right place.
We didn't know what kind of Poutine to order there was such a great selection.
We went with the house special, Braised beef, mozzarella, cheese curds & red wine gravy. 
A bit skeptical of the red wine gravy, we asked for a sample. Right away, sir! 
We tried the gravy & it was delicious! 
The braised beef was spectacular, fries were steaming hot & gravy equally hot.
Waitstaff was very pleasant & very accommodating. It was very well priced.

We highly recommend Poutineville!"}
{"text":"This place has great poutine with lots of options and cheap beer specials. The service is really friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Tout le monde m'en parlait, me jurait que c'était LA meilleur poutine de Montreal. C'est peut-être justement parce qu'on m'a trop vanté les mérites de cet endroit que j'ai été assez déçue.

Ici pas de carte, mais une feuille où on doit cocher les ingrédients qu'on souhaite ajouter à ses frites ou patates écrasées. J'ai voulu réaliser une poutine semblable à celle que j'avais mangée à la Banquise et j'ai vite changé d'avis lorsque j'ai vu que j'arrivais à plus de 15$ (pour 10$ à la Banquise).

J'ai donc fait simple, une poutine de patates écrasées classique pour 13$ hors tips. C'était bon, mais pas transcendant. Le personnel est serviable mais le cadre est froid et peu éclairé (même si je ne pense pas que Poutineville se veut être un endroit romantique aux lumières tamisées ^^)."}
{"text":"Definitely the best poutine in Toronto.  It is much better than Smoke's which I am very happy about.  I had the crushed potatoes instead of regular fries which turned out to be surprisingly delicious.  The gravy is also very good and the cheese curds were very fresh.

This is the best poutine you will get without going to Montreal."}
{"text":"Being La Poutine Week, we decided to celebrate with, well, poutine. We went on a Tuesday and encountered a full house. I ordered a vegetarian poutine and my friend customized one for herself. Being tasty, both sufficiently fulfilled our poutine cravings. But the servings being intimidating in size, we had to doggy bag most of it. Albeit the atmosphere being a bit loud, it was overall a fun and friendly experience.

If I were to suggest one area requiring improvement, it'd be that I felt the restaurant is a bit understaffed. Because everyone was so busy servicing the many tables, it was difficult to waive down staff, several orders got mixed up between tables and the food was slow to arrive. I think adding one or two more people per shift would probably make a world of difference to improve this."}
{"text":"Had the regular poutine with crushed fries, poutine gravy and cheese curds. It was delicious and portions were big. The only problem was the gravy was lukewarm."}
{"text":"5 star poutine!   Came in with a work friend craving some carbs and boy did we get them.   Our waitor was kind and helped us pick The Poutineville from the menu.  He said to always trust when a restaurant puts their  own name on a menu item and boy was he right.   We were almost embarrased when the plate came out since it was so big and there was plenty of steam coming off the gravy.  
The first couple bites were to die for.  The braised beef is so soft and tendor and works so well with the poutine.  They didn't skimp on the cheese curds like some places i've been to.   There is that poutine coma that hits you pretty hard 15 minutes after finishing - expect to receive that for sure.  I shared it but still left really stuffed.   I did notice that they had pogos on the menu.   Perhaps next time I'll go that route just for fun."}
{"text":"Food was good, but the service was awful. 
A friend and I had decided to stop by to sample the all you can eat options available on Tuesdays after 5pm.  When we walked in, we were seated quickly, but had to wait for someone to come and tend to us. When our waitress arrived, she didn't even mention the all you can eat option, but we ordered that anyway. For the first order, each person can choose two of the five poutine variations offered, then the subsequent orders consist of just one poutine each (this was not explained either, but we heard it from a waitress at another table).
When more people started coming in, we were ignored almost completely. Our waitress came to see how we were doing probably every 20 minutes, and each time she would would speak in a clipped way that made her sound annoyed. She only refilled our glasses once when we asked for more water. Another staff member however, did come by more regularly to clear our plates and top off our glasses.
A bill for the all you can eat option came to about $20, including taxes and a very undeserved tip (had I carried smaller bills, the tip would have been less). Overall, overpriced for the quality, which was good, but definitely nothing to write home about. The staff were either overworked or just didn't care about customer satisfaction, and the restaurant got extremely cramped very quickly - my friend had to move the table over to even squeeze out of her seat since the tables were so tightly packed together. I know of other poutineries that not only have better food at better prices, but also much better staff. This isn't a place I would go back to anytime soon."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a co-worker after realizing the restaurant I wanted to try wasn't open. This was the first poutine I have every eaten in my entire life, and it's safe to say that it tasted pretty good. 

However, the service was under par. After waiting for our food, we realized that both of our orders was wrong. My co-workers meal was missing the beef, while my order was completely different. I then had to wait for the correct meal to arrive. The people next to us had a similar issue. That being said, the server did treat us to a free dessert, which was thoughtful. 

Overall, the poutine was pretty good! I love that the gravy is vegetarian, and the fries were super crunchy. But I'm not sure if I will be coming here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Best poutine ever! The ambience is very warm and hip. The place even has a lovely outdoor patio if you feel like dining al fresco.  They have a great menu selection that includes other dishes aside from poutine. You can even customize your poutine . They have a wonderful wine and cocktails selection as well.  Best of all the service is phenomenal. From the moment we walked in and throughout our dinner, the servers and even the owner checked in on us, and they did it in a sincere way.
If you are looking for a place to bring a big group for a celebration, well look nowhere else!  The food and staff will not disappoint you.  Make sure you check out this new place!!"}
{"text":"Great food, lots of veraities of putine so anyone will find something  they like. The portions are big & our waiter was very nice. Combine that with the vibrant neighborhood the place is in & it's a great choice"}
{"text":"Service was outstanding.  Very gracious staff both times that I visited, which were well into the 0300 hour.  The \"Montrealeur\" (sp?) was outstanding, even the latter half I save for breakfast later in the morning."}
{"text":"Un cadre agréable pour prendre une Poutine classic ou bien s'en faire une sur-mesure grâce à leur très grand choix d'ingrédients. Un régal:)"}
{"text":"Came on a Monday afternoon- not very busy as compared to La Banquise 2 days before at about the same time in the afteroon.  This place is 'fancier' than La Banquise- more of a 'Moxie\" vibe rather than a \"Perkins' vibe.

We decided on a 'make your own' poutine option.  The house fries (ecrases) was a nice change to regular fries- The had nice potato flavour, maintained their crispiness towards the end and also maintained their heat- one has to appreciate hot fries at the end of the plate. We had their meat sauce option- very meaty- reminded us of a non-tomato based meat sauce.  Cheese curds weren't overly abundant, but there was enough to satisfy- the good thing- we mixed in mozarella which made everything deliciously stringy.  The curds were half melted which was also a nice change to cold curds coated with sauce.  Actually the temperature of the whole plate was rather pleasantly hot rather than just warm- who really wants warm poutine when piping hot is an option.  We ordered the small size to share- which was decent- the poutine was tasty enought that had we ordered the larger size, we probably would've finished it.  $13.50- not as well priced as LaBanquise, but it wasn't the same thing.


Oh yes, very good burgers- the garlic aioli made the difference between OK and GREAT.


Would need to go back and order some different things ... it was that good."}
{"text":"Coming back for those deep fried dill pickles :) and the super friendly owners who are so much fun !!"}
{"text":"I came here during lunch and it was not too busy. The service and food were both very good. Our server was very attentive, friendly, had a cool accent, and also said that we \"were his favourite customers so far.\" The poutine is customizable and unique, and are also large portions. The owner of the restaurant also came and chatted with us and is very friendly. 

Overall, the environment and food here is amazing and I will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"We were a large group of 8 and we showed up without a reservation, expecting to wait for a long time. The restaurant was quite full but we were able to be seated in less than 10 minutes. Not only were they graciously accommodating of our large party but our waitress was also really nice. It was everybody's first poutine experience and it was an extremely satisfying one. The fire-breather poutine was on point."}
{"text":"The poutine here is aaaaaaaAMAZINGGGGG! I came here on a Friday and it seemed very busy, and most of the tables were full. Despite that, I was served fairly quick and the waitress was super nice. Just thinking about this place makes my taste buds water. I will definitely be coming back for more. :)"}
{"text":"If you're a poutine virgin you have to try this place first and maybe Yelp about it later when you're done washing down the sweet taste of gravy with an iced cold beer, you can phone a friend and say, ¨Damn!¨. 

Make your own poutine so you can't go wrong! Variety of fries, cheese and sauce, oh my! Pogo's in my belly."}
{"text":"Quand t'aimes pas la poutine comme elle doit l'être, tu vas chez Poutineville. Les patates ne gouttent rien, le fromage ne goutte rien, la sauce de style St-Hubert ne va pas avec la poutine.

Et en plus, ça fait 3 styles de poutine que je mange là et les ingrédients qu'ils ajoutent à leur poutine sont ben trop cuit. Le poulet était dur comme du carton. Les ailes de poulets, bof, Costco en fait des meilleures. 

Poutineville sert plusieurs version de sa poutine car justement sa poutine de base ne goutte rien. Donc peut importe la version que tu mange, tu ne goutte pas les patates, ni le fromage. Donc ça donne quoi manger une poutine comme ça? Ça doit être parce que t'aime pas la vraie poutine. ;-)

Pour moi, une vraie poutine c'est fait avec une patate ferme, dense, un peu sucrée, bien cuite, bien dorée, pas moelleuse, avec du vrai bon fromage en grain squick squick, du gravy à poutine, pas de la sauce BBQ pour le poulet. 

Une excellente poutine c'est tellement facile à faire, y'en a partout au Québec dans plusieurs casse-croutes. Je trouve inacceptable de voir un restaurant qui se spécialise en poutine ne pas avoir une fondation de qualité."}
{"text":"Pros: Delicious food, reasonable prices, great service
Cons: Nothing!

Had to try poutine while in Montreal, and we picked the best place to do it! This place was amazing. All of the food was delicious and plentiful. The service was very friendly and very helpful (and bilingual!). We had the house special Poutineville, wings, quesadilla, and pulled pork sandwich. Everything was great - we couldn't finish  it all and basically had to roll out of the restaurant. We easily found street parking nearby. Would highly recommend this place and will definitely return here if we are ever in the area."}
{"text":"I'm new to Montreal, only been living here about a month and a half, and this was the second poutine place I've been to, so my knowledge isn't too versed in this type of thing. But I thought this place was super delicious, they have great food with plenty of options, tasty drinks and great service. I'm definitely going to bring anyone who comes to visit me to Poutineville for their first poutine!"}
{"text":"Great poutine (even by Montreal standards), a casual atmosphere, and a simple menu for customizing your poutine! Really enjoyed it every time I've been."}
{"text":"We are from NY and were told we needed to try poutine and smoked meat. First, having had disco fries, the only real difference between traditional poutine and disco fries is cheese curds vs melted American cheese. We went for the traditional poutine there and it was definitely good but you can also order it as you wanted which is probably very interesting.  We had the smoked meat deli sandwiches and they were outstanding! Luckily we got there around 6pm because by 7pm there was a line forming out of the door. My husband ordered 911 wings and while tasty they did not have a ton of heat but the flavor was very good. 

If you find yourself in Montreal and want a smoked meat sandwich and poutine this place will satisfy you."}
{"text":"Not a bad poutine place. Cut fries are beautifully crisp and sets this place apart from other joints. Cheese curds are good but the gravy could be better to make the poutine outstsnding. Gravy still had clumps in it and not hot enough over the dish. Great big portions for sharing!"}
{"text":"Définitivement l'endroit par excellence pour manger de la poutine!  Des poutines pour tout les gouts et même une carte pour personnaliser la sienne de A à Z (même jusqu'a son nom! ce qui peut être assez rigolo!) Rien n'est laissé au hasard, on peut réellement y trouver sa poutine toute désignée! 
Seul petit point plus négatif, surtout pour ceux avec de petits appétits, les portions sont assez grosses! Mais on peut toujours ramener ce qu'on a pas mangé sur le coup pour plus tard ;P
Sinon, je recommande cet endroit à n'importe qui aurait envie d'une bonne poutine! :)"}
{"text":"The Montrealer poutine was delicious!
The gravy is absolutely tasty, the fried pickle on top of the smoked meat makes it even more delicious!

Just a quick note about the service: we were there on a Thursday night and the place wasn't very busy... but three waiters were still rushing to take our plates away(even while we were still eating). I did not understand why such a rush."}
{"text":"Last night in Montreal and had to try this place poutine and it was great! I had the traditional and it was delicious. The mix of ingredients sounds nasty, but put a piece in your mouth and it is delicious. Recommend their poutine if you're in Montreal."}
{"text":"Loved their burger even more than the poutine. The poutine was skimpy with the cheese... service was very sub par. But this is a place with decent poutine at a very accessible location. And what everyone says about the lighting and heating/air conditioning is true-there is none."}
{"text":"Je n'ai pas apprécié la nourriture. Selon moi puisque la poutine est leur plat qui les décrit elle devrait être absolument fabuleuse mais ça a été un échec. J'y suis allé pour mon anniversaire et j'ai été vraiment déçu. Mais le service est excellent!! :)"}
{"text":"When in Montreal....you go to the place with a name that promises nothing but poutine. 
And then you leave blissfully stuffed and happy that the promise was fulfilled. 
First off, the service is fantastic! Our waitress was attentive, friendly, and patient - with the build-your-own-poutine menu, we needed some guidance. She even brought us a sample of their signature smashed potatoes (écrassées) to taste before ordering. 

After much deliberation, le boy and I decided to split a grande (it truly is!) Classique, which includes cheese curds, braised beef, the aforementioned potatoes, and a red-wine gravy/sauce. Seriously, one of the most satisfying simple dishes I've ever had! And definitely as far as poutine goes, the flavors were balanced and not too salty, which is what usually happens to other poutines that I've had. 

In a futile effort to balance out the meal with something light, we also shared the grande warm goat-cheese and eggplant salad. Turns out they know how to make delicious \"healthy\" fare here too!

Miraculously, I still had room for dessert and got the brownie cheesecake. It felt a bit like an afterthought (tasted like grocery-store variety), but I can't fault them too much for it - it's doubtful that many people have any room for dessert after a meal at Poutineville. 

After I leave Montreal, this meal is one that I'll be trying to replicate back home unsuccessfully, I fear."}
{"text":"I try to go to this place at least once a trip when I am in Montreal. The twice fried potatoes make the poutine! You can get exactly what you want on them and I highly recommend the spicy sauce. I have brought friends here who have never had poutine and it made them instant converts."}
{"text":"My new spot for Poutine in Montreal. I used to try places in old Montreal and didn't realize how much better this place is than the others. I tried the house special. Excellent portions and very well made. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Very good poutine. My favorite is the braised beef with squished potatoes and goat cheese. You can choose your fries, toppings, cheese, etc. The sweet potatoes are very good.
This place is great, and it's open late! Their chicken sandwich is also very tasty if you're looking for a healthier option."}
{"text":"Crushed potatoes!  Where have you been all my life?!

This place is delicious.  The staff are helpful.  Just come!"}
{"text":"Ça va me faire valoir des lapidations, mais je tiens à le dire : c'est clairement la meilleure poutine à Montréal. Et je me tanne jamais des patates écrasées, de la faire gratiner, de la manger à des heures quand même acceptables... Et le meilleur, oui, le meilleur, c'est que t'as même pas besoin d'être en état d'ébriété pour l'apprécier!

OUI OUI. Cette poutine m'a gagnée à tout jamais. 

Le petit plus, c'est s'inventer un nom à chaque fois. Présentement, je suis une copine de super-héros à chaque fois que j'y vais. Entre Vicki Vale et Mary-Jane Watson, mon choix n'arrête pas de changer!"}
{"text":"I really don't like poutine. The combination of fries, gravy and cheese just doesn't work for me. Though I LOVE THIS PLACE! The available choices, quality, staff and atmosphere is pretty awesome! I'd eat poutine anytime here! I also suggest the onion rings as an appetizer. mmmmm!"}
{"text":"C'est mon endroit favori lorsque j'ai passé envie de poutine. Jamais déçu. Personnel très attentionné, ambiance chaleureuse surtout en hiver."}
{"text":"Les poutines sont absolument excellentes !!! 
Je recommande de gouter avec les patate douce, c'est sublime !! 
Jamais déçu, et les serveurs sont fort sympathiques ! =)"}
{"text":"This was our second time here. Unfortunately this time we arrived at 10:40 PM and they refused to seat us since they closed at 11 PM. The host said that they stop seating 15 minutes before they close and just shrugged his shoulders when I pointed out that it was 20 minutes until they closed when we arrived. The food was good the first time, but the service was bad. It seemed like kind of a conveyer belt where you were expected to sit down, order, eat, pay, and leave. Definitely not fine dining. But it was good and we wanted to go again tonight, but I guess the kids decided they wanted to go home early."}
{"text":"My first time trying this place. I ordered takeout. Large size regular style poutine with braised beef. It was really Good! The menu was quite diverse as you can build your own flavour of poutine. Different cheeses, vegetables, meats, and gravy."}
{"text":"j'adore leurs poutines que l'on peux personaliser, c'est un concept génial! De plus, le service à la clientel est vraiment sympathique :)"}
{"text":"Une heure entre la commande et l'arrivée des plats! Pour de la poutine. Vous épluchez les patates à mesure?"}
{"text":"Je ne m'attendais pas à grand chose... Bonne surprise. Le staff est sympathique, et les variétés de poutine surprenantes et alléchantes. J'ai adoré la \"Poutineville\", au buf braisé. Miam."}
{"text":"Excellent menu, food and service. Terrific local ownership. Will be back!  The poutine gravy is remarkable, and trying specialty fries next time."}
{"text":"J'aime vraiment la Poutine avec les patates écrasées. Elle est délicieuse. Le service est impeccable! Ce que j'aime énormément c'est que l'on puisse sois-même créer sa propre Poutine ! Même pas obligée de respecter une carte ! Et sincèrement il faut être un très très gros mangeur pour avaler une grande Poutine. Généralement la Poutine régulière est suffisante pour un mangeur moyen !"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. This is why:

1. VEGETARIAN GRAVY IS THE DEFAULT. They only have one gravy that is not vegetarian. They also offer a number of gluten-free gravies - although I do not know how well they protect against cross-contamination, so I would be sure to ask about that if you have Celiac disease. Sorry vegans but I can't remember if there are vegan cheeses available. Will ask next time and update my review accordingly.  

2. Their poutines are DELICIOUS. So, so tasty. And you craft your own dish, from fries to gravy to toppings. WIN! 

3. Great energy: awesome staff, chill vibe, great music choices. If you ask nicely, they will play any song you request - with accompanying music video.  

4. Bounty of alcoholic beverages available. Poutine accompanied by bourbon on the rocks? Why not! 

Never change, Poutineville.*


*Unless you do not offer vegan cheese and a separate prep area and tools for gluten-free diners. If this the case, you should change a little."}
{"text":"We were here a few weeks ago.  Came today, September 4 and it is closed!  For good!  So upset as I had the best poutine here, and now there is no where else to go!"}
{"text":"Poutine is pretty much everywhere in montreal...

We recently moved to Rosemont area recently and took a break from unpacking, so naturally we walked around the neighborhood to get something to eat, and this place is just around the corner...

They have signature fries called ecrasé in their poutine, which consists of unpeeled wedges which are boiled then crushed then fried, it gives the fries more surface area to develop a crust. It's quite nice.

There are quite a few choices, the standard varieties are there, like bacon, pizza and galvaude... and you get a little score menu where you can make your own, and you can check off what you want like in a sushi resto.

My friend had the godfather poutine  which tasted like pizza, and I made my own with bacon, cheddar, cold slaw and red wine sauce, it was nice, it had some tanginess of the cold slaw with salty bacon (real bacon, thick cut pieces), and sharp cheddar to tie it all together.

The poutine are about 12$ each, a bit on the pricier side, but it's good and the portions are huge. We also order a sample appetizer which had chicken wings, fried pickles, onion rings and fried cheese sticks, served with salsa and spicy mayo.

Yummy, I definitely think it's better than la banquise, and the place always seems to be full when we pass by.

On the menu there is this poutine called the heart attack!!! it's served in a huge frying pan, and it costs 50$!!! for 10-12 pounds of fries!!!"}
{"text":"Great place! The best poutine I have tried! We first tried Poutineville in Montreal and loved it! As soon as my husband and I found out they were opening in Toronto we went crazy about it."}
{"text":"Ma toute première poutine ! Le service était top et la poutine que j'ai composée moi même était délicieuse  ! Bonne entrée en matière"}
{"text":"Poutineville - the name sums it up. We stopped here early on a Thursday afternoon for lunch on our way to Casa Loma. I ordered the Poutineville and my husband had the Hawgs Town. The crushed potatoes on my poutine were fantastic, although I wish either the meat or the red wine gravy had just a smidge more seasoning (but still, it's poutine - you really can't go wrong). My husband ate his entire dish, and the BBQ gravy on the Hawgs Town was delicious. Service was good, although our meals were a little slow coming out of the kitchen considering there were only two other tables occupied at the time we visited. I would definitely make a return trip here, but unfortunately, I live out of the country."}
{"text":"First time here in July 2015...it was for take-out. Was recommended by the server that their classic poutine was potatoes, cheese curds, gravy, and braised beef. It was incredible. It was the best tasting poutine I have ever had.

Portion was huge...impossible to finish. My wife and I shared and I still had a whole meal's worth of leftovers for the following day.

try this place...you will not be disappointed if you are looking for poutine and pub!"}
{"text":"Really great location that you get seated and served very quickly. The food is always delicious and so much to choose from! Tip: in summer, their patio is the place to be."}
{"text":"Best place for poutine ever! You can mix and match yours ingredients. There are traditional and more fancy choices. Always good! And plates are generous. Love it"}
{"text":"We opted to go here because the line up for Labanquise was pretty long. This line up was a lot less. Did a build your own poutine. I got pulled pork in mine and my husband did a handful of meats. I liked that you can do many cheeses for the same price and there's a lot of gravy options as well as selected cut fries options. For toppings there are so many choices of veggies and meats and sides. We both did classic fries and gravy but they are known for their crushed fries. Overall it was good it can get a bit pricy with the build your own. I also didn't like that mine was swimming in gravy (like beating swimming) and the fries were limited. Because of that my first choice is still labanquise."}
{"text":"Je me suis composé une poutine avec les fameuses patates écrasées et c'était merveilleux!! Service courtois et rapide. La décoration laisse à désirer, mais c'est tellement bon qu'on oublie rapidement! J'en veux encore!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat a good poutine in town. The best thing about it is that, unlike other restaurants where you feel heavy after eating poutine, this restaurant's poutine makes you feel good instead ;)  Definitely will be going again."}
{"text":"Super bonne poutine! Mais pourquoi tant de choix! La classique fait mon bonheur! Si vous prenez autre chose que de la poutine, les prix sont un peu cher..."}
{"text":"Went there at 4am and they were open. Huzzah! There are a ton of options so I asked the waitress what was good and she said the \"poutineville poutine\" so I ordered that. The large is WAY larger than a small and only a few bucks more so it's a better deal.  We did takeout and it was one of the best poutines I've ever had!"}
{"text":"L'ambiance était agréable (le devant du resto était grand ouvert, c'était plaisant!), ma poutine était délicieuse, le service était bon et le martini au banana split était divin! De loin l'un de meilleurs drinks que j'ai pris dans ma vie de jeune adulte. :) Les desserts du jours semblaient ordinaires, alors je n'en ai pas pris. Il y a eu un oubli d'un ingrédient dans la poutine à mon copain, mais au nombre d'ingrédients qu'il a demandé, c'est compréhensible et à part ça, le service était bien alors ça ne nous a pas dérangé du tout. C'est certain que j'y retourne si l'occasion se présente. :)"}
{"text":"Horrendous. Not sure if I can call what I ate food or not. It's definitely poutine gone crazy but the quality of the fries is average, so is all the condiments. The service was OK but the space, music was tacky. Priced at $15-20 depending on how far you go, its still just not worth it. Most of it went to the trash."}
{"text":"Les frites était excellente, le fromage aussi. Le seul problème était la sauce, qui était à mon goût trop épaisse et qui ressemble à beaucoup de sauce en poudre qu'utilise beaucoup d'autre restaurant et casse croûte. Le décor est assez sombre et un peu vieux."}
{"text":"It's a very nice place, good service, they have a very interesting menu of poutine served with different meats or cheeses. If you've never been there and you generally like a poutine then you really should give it a try. Just a little advise, go for the small portion/size it's really filling and well you know, it's fries in gravy so enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Take their specialty : the PoutineVille one.
Best in town.
Don't get fancy and try anything else because all the rest is below. Don't try to make it yourself. Just enjoy a well done work."}
{"text":"Je ne comprends pas comment une place qui s'appelle Poutineville peut faire de la si mauvaise poutine... Déception totale."}
{"text":"Arguably the best poutine around town! The staff were lovely and the food was delicious! I've also tried the Poutineville down in Montréal before and I'm glad to say that they've managed to maintain their standards. A little tip for the cheese lovers out there is that you can pick 4 of the cheeses (with no extra charge) at the same time when you create your own poutine! Yum :D"}
{"text":"Finally got to go for a build-your-own poutine.   I was impressed with the customer service starting on the phone and then at the restaurant.  Our server was very informative and patient especially once she knew it was our first visit.  We were given samples of their 'smashed potatoes' and the menu was fully explained. She made sure to serve us in both official languages which was both wonderful and refreshing! We were a group of 9 and she served all of us well.  The food was good and portions very generous. I would be pleased to recommend this restaurant to everyone looking for a good poutine."}
{"text":"Ordered their go-to poutine of braised beef and wine sauce, and left very satisfied. The portion for large is huge - easily shareable between 2 people and the service fast and friendly. I like that you can also custom order your poutine with a myriad of options. A bit on the pricey side at about $16CAD for a large poutine."}
{"text":"Bf and I went here just over a month ago, I was pretty shocked to walk in and see that it had a nice seating area and even a small bar at the front. 

I'd say the prices are reasonable for the amount of food your given. We both couldn't finish our servings. The crushed fries are my fav!"}
{"text":"Not a bit fan of poutine but loved the customization aspect of the meal and the servers were cool. Will definitely come back to try and different combo!"}
{"text":"Poutine was really good. We had chicken and mozzarella something very simple yet very delicious. Only complaint was service wasn't that great. We had no attention when we walked in. So we went for takeout instead. Even when we were waiting to be served for takeout it took them forever. When they took the sheet of paper with the toppings you want in the poutine, no smiles nor friendly conversation. They just took my order rudely. There's so many more poutineries around the area with similar quality and better service so might not be returning unless I'm in the area and is desperately craving for poutine."}
{"text":"Having lived in Montreal for over 2 years, I just recently went to Poutineville and it was definitely a place that I will make regular future visits to. I like to keep my poutines \"classic\", so I just ordered the regular cheese curds and poutine gravy, but I did order the smashed fries. The smashed fries are better than they sound. It is almost as if someone made fries...smashed them...and then fried them again. They are perfectly crunchy on the outside and make the meal everything you could ask for. For dessert, I had the choco choux, which was a chocolate cake with raspberries and ENTIRE cream puffs inside. I've never seen anything like it. 

I love the fact that you can either pick something from the menu or you can build your own poutine. There is a selection of about five different gravies, few different kinds of cheese, tons of meats and vegetables. You can choose if you want a small or large portion which is convenient. Be careful though, with enough toppings you may end up paying way more than you planned. For those who are feeling a bit crazy (or have a large party), they offer a giant poutine which consists of 15 pounds of fries and more toppings than one could possibly eat. I had the privledge to see one in person just as I was leaving and the restaurant started to clap at its arrival.  

The staff was polite and attentive. Will definitely be going back. Definitely one of the best poutine places in Montreal.

(Note that they don't accept AMEX!)"}
{"text":"Loved this place! The service was friendly and the food was amazing. My husband and I did the build your own and got the crushed potatoes. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Place à aller quand vous voulez une poutine qui sort de l'ordinaire. Essayez les patates écrasées et la sauce au vin rouge."}
{"text":"My ultimate favorite place to eat.   I absolutely love poutines...I've been here a few times, it has always been a positive experience.  It offers more than poutines, other foods that are awesome as well.  The staff is friendly, atmosphere is relaxing, good place to unwind after a long day.  Service is quick with no pushy waitstaff bothering you while you enjoy your meal.  It's a place I go to enjoy conversation with friends and family.  I always look forward to walking in the doors and receiving a hello and a smile from the staff."}
{"text":"I had the perfect meal here.

Poutineville has a make-your-own poutine menu, which is what we went for.  My girlfriend ordered a traditional poutine, but I got a little fancy and ordered sweet potato fries, fresh curds, and braised beef with traditional sauce.  This is the best combination!  Their sweet potato fries were perfect - not soggy, not dry - and they went perfectly with the gravy and curds.  The braised beef was great on top of it all.  It was exactly what I wanted.

They also have a good beer selection and the service was quick."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious poutine. I decided to try the crush potatoes instead of the traditional fries and it was fantastic. I also opted for all of the cheeses on offer as it was no extra to have a mix. WOW. The best poutine I have had in Montreal yet. You must try it! 

Oh - and the service was brilliant too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the service was fantastic, the food was amazing, and the brisket was better than in my native state of texas ::ducks::. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I love poutine but have high expectations. It wasn't bad, I would say it was enjoyable. However, it was not a particularly memorable experience. It was not the Montreal-style poutine I hoped for.

The service was not great. I expect much more from a brand new restaurant. I had to ask for the water, and we didn't get cutlery. We also barely got a smile. 

Worst of all the cheese curds were so cold they never warmed up enough to get that perfect level of slightly melted you want in a poutine. There wasn't a single string of cheese (I  didn't get the added mozzarella, just the curds). 

The gravy was nice and the crushed potatoes were a unique and tasty touch. I'd go back if I had to but I was overall a little disappointed. I think it just depends on your standards and expectations. If you want a fun poutine with pick your own toppings it's great. If you want a perfect, classic, Montreal-style poutine, this isn't the place I wanted it to be."}
{"text":"We went here for our inaugural poutine experience. Did not disappoint! Great food. Great atmosphere. Great for a nice night out."}
{"text":"This place was great.  We were in Montreal for one night and this hit the spot.  Great service, awesome dessert and even better food.  We both made our own Poutine, which made for a great experience.  The beers on tap were tasty.  The regular size was more than enough.  I would not hesitate to return the next time I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"For a long time like everybody i used to think \"la banquise\" was the best Poutine spot
Until i went at poutineville

They have the most delicioud ones with out a doubt

I loved the 3 Pepper sauce 
I Just need them to make delivery now Ahaha"}
{"text":"Service and food were great. It's a build your own poutine and they have other great menu items. We spoke with the owner, he's nice and friendly. Definitely recommend coming and checking out poutine if you are a tourist."}
{"text":"We weren't sure if we wanted to eat Poutine at Poutineville or seek other places (for instance, Patati Patata). Anyway we decided Poutineville and were not disappointed. The moment we arrived we were greeted by three people, one was the owner. The waiter was informative, pleasant, and welcoming. He suggested few variations of potines and we were not disappointed. I have to warn you though that Poutine is a heavy meal If you have high metabolism you will love experimenting with the variations,  else choose wisely.

We ordered 2 Potine Sampler (I love this because of variation of texture and easy to finish), Montrealer (many textures of cheese and flavors), Steak Filet Mignon (only to the brave heart: very filling yet tasty), Rocky (was not sure if we could handle), and Hat trick (hearty meal when eaten in small quantities). We were a party of 5 and we all felt more than satisfied, yet plagued with guilt afterward. So, be careful with your choices and the size of plates. What they call small is very large portion.

The seating was pretty good and the ambiance inviting. Like most small joints in Montreal, this is a family-owned restaurant, and you immediately feel   welcomed and connected to the people who work there."}
{"text":"Love the hand-crushed potatoes (order them instead of the normal fries). I had the special poutineville house poutine. It was awesome with red wine gravy! You can also choose to mix and match what you wanna put in your poutine. Very easy to customise to your taste and preference! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a place to have nice poutine."}
{"text":"I love love love love love poutine.  Poutineville has great poutine!  Poutineville offers all the fixin's you would want with their order system being a checkmark card; pick the fry type, gravy type, cheese and extra toppings.  It's a simple effective system that allows you to be creative.  Nevertheless, I always go with the classic. They have squish squish (squeaky cheese) & classic poutine sauce.  The fries are average, and I find they sometimes overdo it on the gravy, but I mean, that is coming from a nitpicky person.  It really is decent and they have deep fried pickles on the menu that, to my personal experience, are the best in the city, so that's a HUGE benefit. Check them out and don't hesitate to order the deepfried pickles to go with your poutine."}
{"text":"I have to say, I did not have high expectations after walking into this restaurant. The moment I entered I was hit with an awful smell - something I had smelled before but couldn't put my finger on. I almost had to leave when I realized that it was the same smell I had encountered in a tranny bar once (don't ask!). I would describe it as two-thirds pee and one-third cigarettes. Gross.

My fiancé had eaten there before and assured me it was good. He didn't seem to smell it, and the place looked pretty clean and I was starving so we ordered. I was very, very surprised when I had my goat cheese and veggie poutine. It was really good! The crushed potatoes are awesome! 

Besides the smell, the only other downside is the clientele that this place attracts. We were seated next to a table of about 15 kids (who couldn't have been older than 14 or 15) who were super loud and obnoxious. One girl in particular had a high-pitched nasal-y voice that made me want to punch her in the face. But that isn't the restaurant's fault I guess. 

The other downside- I didn't find the portions particularly filling. I wasn't very satisfied when I left, but maybe I only felt that way because it was so good and I wanted more!

Long story short, I have a feeling I'll keep coming back here- but for take-out instead."}
{"text":"Good fast service, interesting twist on regular food. My first time to eat this dis. iIt was quite amazing. portions too big, but all seemed fresh and tasty. Staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Very nice and friendly poutine place. 
This is the place to go if u crave poutine. The concept is amazing, unique and the food simply delicious."}
{"text":"This a very simple theme- not haute cuisine but some of the best Poutine I have had. Friendly service and a great choice of menu items. They have set offerings but you can also \"build you own\" from a list of options. Portions are generous so only get the large if you are extremely hungry. The cream ale from St-Ambroise is excellent."}
{"text":"Belle variété de Poutine. Mes amis ont même essayé la plus grosse dans laquelle il y a tout post-entraînement et n'ont pas été capable de la finir. J'aime avoir le choix de types de frites, de sauce et d'ingrédients, ça change de la traditionnelle poutine. Les patates douces sont excellentes en poutine!"}
{"text":"Very delicious food. good experience in this restaurant. 5 star rating.I will be back!"}
{"text":"There was nobody more excited yet apprehensive at yesterday's grand opening of Poutineville in Toronto's Annex than the Urban Foodie.  As a lover of poutine, I was delighted to hear back in April from Michael Fresco that there would be another entrant into the Toronto poutine scene.  But, would Poutineville live up to the hype?  

Poutineville was promising an upscale sit down establishment where you could have a drink and choose from a variety of specialty poutines such as the Filet Mignon (fresh crispy home fries topped with cubed, tender AAA filet mignon, sauteed mushrooms, caramalized onions, fresh cheese curds with a hint of blue cheese and home made pepper sauce).  But what if you were feeling creative and adventurous?  You could customize your own poutine from the type of potatoes and cheeses right down to the meats, vegetables and sauces!  Throw in the infamous Heart Attack poutine (a $100 poutine weighing over 15lbs) and you have elements of a poutine joint that Toronto has never seen.  A winning formula in my mind... 

But that's why I was feeling so apprehensive even leading up  to my first bite at Poutineville.  I really wanted this place to fulfill my expectations... my poutine dreams if you will.  So how was it?

In the evening, Poutineville was dimly lit with Edlison bulb lights throughout... how romantic I thought :).  The interiors had exposed wood and brick giving the ambiance a cool industrial look.  It seemed like the white counter top bar with under-lighting was well stocked.  Speakers were scattered throughout the place pumping out top 40s music while TV screens played the accompanying music videos.  I'm sure this place is going to be a favourite amongst the after clubbing crowd... it is open until 4am from Thursday to Saturday after all.

So how is the poutine?  Below is an image of the create your own poutine menu.  You can check whatever you wish and any box with a number beside it represents an add-on dollar value to the base price.

While tempting, I opted to order the Shepherd's Pie poutine and the namesake poutine, the Poutineville.

Shepherd's Pie ($12) - Hand crushed potatoes* with fresh cheese curds, minced beef, corn, peas topped with their home made poutine sauce and melted mozzarella cheese

The Shepherd's Pie poutine was delicious!  I liked how there were 2 types of cheese.  You have your traditional squeaky cheese curds scattered throughout the mess of poutine and on top you have a baked mozzarella cheese canopy.  The cheese canopy had crispy broil marked parts as well as areas of melted, gooey goodness!  Because it was baked, the temperature of the dish was warm throughout.  Also, the poutine actually tasted like a Shepherd's pie with familiar ingredients such as minced beef, corn, and peas.  The peas made the poutine extra fragrant and is an ingredient that really distinguishes the dish. *What I didn't realize until after I left was that the Shepherd's pie poutine was served with regular cut fries instead of the hand crushed potato variety as per the description.  Perhaps they ran out of hand crushed potatoes?  Opening day kinks?  I thought the hand cut fries worked well in the dish but a little notice would have been appreciated.  


Poutineville ($12) - A house specialty of hand crushed potatoes* with fresh cheese curds and mozzarella topped with their slow 8 hour home cooked braised beef and wine sauce

I usually resist the temptation to get braised beef in restaurants because it often isn't done well and this frequently results in dry, tough meat.  Poutine with braised beef typically would not be the exception had it not been the namesake dish of the restaurant.  I mean, I had to order it, it's their specialty!  To my surprise, the braised beef was moist, tender and flavourful, perhaps they really did slow cook it for 8 hours...  It was tasty but it was a bit on the cold side.  It's probably because the beef is cooked separately from everything else and sits at room temperature while waiting to be part of a greater whole.  It wouldn't be a problem if the wine sauce was piping hot and covered the entire poutine but that was a miss on both parts... I'm just going to give them the benefit of the doubt and attribute this to opening night jitters.  The wine sauce wasn't too acidic like I feared and instead it made for a full-bodied sauce.  The cheese curds were squeaky which is a must for a great poutine.  Unfortunately, the hand crushed potatoes were substituted for regular fries without my knowledge as well.

Overall, I still had a great time at Poutineville.  I'm sure they will will work out their kinks and become one of the elite poutine places in Toronto - I have faith!  I'll give them another chance to serve me the hand crushed potatoes I've heard so much about.  I'll also definitely go back to eat a Montrealer... smoked meat poutine topped with a fried pickle!  Ironically, the Montrealer comes with the regular cut variety..."}
{"text":"Best poutine I've had in Canada (we tried 3 places, it's rich stuff). We weren't too hungry so we split the sampler and got cheese sandwiches. 

The sweet potato poutine with pepper gravy was incredible. Cheese sandwiches were nice- crispy and gooey. 

We sat in front by the open window. Probably a little warm partially in the sun that afternoon, so you might ask for something else if you've been walking around for a while. Seating was a little crowded, but a pleasant place to stop"}
{"text":"Great poutines! Trust me, I've been eating them all my life and I only eat them here or at La Banquise."}
{"text":"I have to say that this poutine although its not the best it is above average.

The sauce is just thick and delicious, I like that they don't put to much of it and it doesn't become a soup like some other poutines. They also use a lots of cheese which I like.

Now the option of making your own poutine is pretty cool, although be careful because it can get really expensive quick. The only down side is the fries are frozen fries which really prevents me from putting their poutine on top. To me its a bummer, it would be so much better with real potatoes, but hey its still worth the shot at least once."}
{"text":"Want some great poutine? GO HERE. My boyfriend and I were on the hunt for some poutine and came across this joint. I mean, with a name like Poutineville - it's gotta be good, right? We ordered a regular size of the house poutine and the fire breather. Both were AMAZING. I was craving something spicy so the fire breather hit the spot. I have a pretty high tolerance for spicy foods so I didn't think it was really that spicy. It was more of a moderate, enjoyable level of spicy rather than a melt-your-face-off spicy. The waiter thought I was crazy and praised my ability to finish it off without a sip of water, but in all honesty, it wasn't that bad.

The house poutine was delicious - the meat melts in your mouth and has a great flavor to it. The potatoes in both were perfectly fried and bite-sized. If you're a fan of spicy things then I would definitely get the fire breather. It comes with 3 wings on top and I don't know what kind of sauce they use, but it was AMAZING. It tasted like a slightly spicy BBQ sauce. I would definitely come back for that one. Our waiter was laid back and joked around a lot - overall a really good experience."}
{"text":"Sadly I was unable to have poutine on my last trip in mid January, but I made it my mission to have this before leaving on Sunday. Me and my hostel buddy came here, although the trek was long and the wait. Our server made things better than anticipated. We literally ordered and the food arrived 3 mins later. I ordered a poutine with house special cut fries, classic gravy, poulet (chicken) mushrooms, green peppers, mozzarella and cheese curls. My only regret with this meal is that I ordered the regular size xD this was amazing poutine, better than when I had my 1st one 5 years ago. The meal left me wanting more and boy was the poutine fresh. Well worth the wait and I highly recommend trying this place. Lol we need a poutine spot in nyc"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was good. Would go again.

I got the poutine with crushed fries, tomatoes, onions and eggplant on the side. 

I was told to get the regular size because the large too big."}
{"text":"Went at noon on a Sunday with one friend. We didn't have to wait at all. Service was pretty good. There was only one waitress serving everyone so we did have to catch her attention every now and then, but the poutine was worth it!

As someone who doesn't eat meat, I loved being able to design my own poutine."}
{"text":"Bon mais parfois un peu cher pour ce que c'est. L'option de pouvoir choisir ce qu'on met dans la poutine est chouette mais ça fait grimper la note ridiculement vite."}
{"text":"Beat. Poutine. Ever.

I've been in search for the best poutine in Toronto and I think I might've found the place that offers it. Not only is the ability to customize and create your own poutine great, but the selection of ingredients available to you is also wonderful. But asides from having the ability to customize your own poutine, the food is simply tasty. The fries are crispy, the cheese curds melt into glorious strings (which I find to be very rare at other restaurants), and most importantly the gravy is seasoned just right (not too salty and not too oily). 

If you've been looking for the best poutine, I highly suggest you come to this place. Seriously, you haven't had good poutine until you've had it here."}
{"text":"Poutineville est un bon restaurant. Le fait de pouvoir choisir exactement ce qu'on veux mettre dans notre poutine est vraiment appréciable! Personnellement j'ai préféré à la banquise! Déjà l'endroit est plus calme, ce qui est pas négligeable pour manger quand même! Le prix est peut être plus cher, mais c'est aussi parce que j'ai mis plusieurs ingrédients dans ma poutine. A choisir si je dois retourner manger une poutine, je choisirais Poutineville"}
{"text":"Excellent way to get your wife to eat poutine.  

Despite the name, this place was noticeably more upscale in flavor (and decor?) than your typical poutine joint.  While I'm all about the greasy stuff, the poutine here has what i could only describe as more grown up.... potatoes instead of fries, braised meats, wine sauce instead of gravy."}
{"text":"After strolling in the park nearby, three of us felt hungry and decided to try this restaurant. After trying the apple maps and getting lost in the street, we asked the friendly pedestrians for the directions, just like the good old days and found in no time . The restaurant has great ambience . The menu has the options to choose from regular or large sizes. This place is ideal for the  people who likes their poutine different from others. They give you a paper and pencil that you had to tick the options from them. One  has lot of options to choose from the type of fries , the cheese curds, the gravy , the meat, the veggies. Don't worry if you forgot to tick one , the waitress make sure that you do your homework well. The lady who served was very nice with her welcoming smile and made sure our food comes to the table on time . The poutine was great . The washrooms were neat and tidy. They had good wine cellar and other varieties of beers and cocktails too."}
{"text":"We usually pick up and not eat in the restaurant, so we can't comment much on the service. Nice and tasty pountine."}
{"text":"im in love with this place! you can choose to create/build your own poutine, or go with the ones off the menu. either way, they were all delicious. i prefer their house crushed potatoes over their hand cut fries. the red wine base is also a must try. service is also great. both times i went there the workers were super friendly."}
{"text":"The Montrealer: in itself worth a drive up from the States.

Foiled by long lines and -20C temperatures at La Banquise, popped around Parc La Fontaine to Poutineville to satisfy our saturated fat craving.  Seated promptly and ordered a selection including poutines with braised beef (the house original), smoked meat (the Montrealer), and filet mignon/blue cheese.

Uniquely, Poutineville's fries are instead crispy golden crushed potatoes (not quite cubed home fries), which to be honest, are probably an improvement on straight or crinkle-cut (a la Shake Shack) potatoes in that they carry toppings more efficiently.

About toppings, the Montrealer's smoked meat (didn't know that was a Montreal *thing*) really took top honors when combined with savory gravy and the crunch of potatoes.  While also good, the smoked meat's flavors cast large shadows over the slightly more sophisticated flavors in the wine-braised beef as well as the tender filet morsels.  But to hell with sophistication; get the smoked meat!

On the down side, cheese curds melted quickly between the hot confines of potatoes and gravy.  None of the characteristic cheesy squeak notable of the freshest cheeses in Wisconsin, etc. 

I'm sure these guys would make a killing in the US, even in New York City."}
{"text":"First, if you don't know what Poutine is, check out this link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poutine

Second, forget everything you've read and be prepared for an experience that truly makes this dish superb.  Besides the traditional fries, gravy and cheese, there are so many ways to customize your Poutine experience at Poutineville that even the staunchest critic will become a fan.  Simply stated, the food and service were outstanding.  We had a delicious dinner and Georgia was the perfect server.  Even the beer selection was quite good and also reasonably priced.  I upgraded to filet mignon with bacon - does it really get any better than that?"}
{"text":"Best poutine ever! Had \"The Hangover\". You can actually create your own there. Going to try that next time."}
{"text":"Sadly I really don't rate this place and that really disappoints me. 

I went for the all you can eat on Tuesday which is $15 with my boyfriend. Now I don't know if it was just because it was all you can eat so they lower their standards or if this place is just a bit naff. I fear the latter. 

The chips were under cooked and the near was full of oil. Our waitress contrary to other reviews, didn't seem to leave us alone, she was back and forth asking if everything was okay but she was really fake about it. 

$15 may be good for all you can eat poutine (a choice of their five signatures) but if I was paying full whack and got that standard I'd be seriously peeved. 

Save yourself the dolla and go elsewhere I say!"}
{"text":"Excellentes les poutines! La Poutineville est servie avec des quartiers de patates et non des frites et juste assez de sauce pour qu'elles n'y trempent pas. La portion \"normale\" est déjà très importante pour un adulte, je ne recommande pas la version \"large\" sauf si vous la consommé à deux!

Je n'y suis passé que les vendredis soirs, et à chaque fois le restaurant est bondé et il y a une file d'attente; donc à planifier en conséquence. Les places sont très étroites et le décor minimal, sans être style cafétéria."}
{"text":"Although I am a resident of Poutineville, aka Montreal, I honestly don't eat poutine very often. Perhaps once every six months. I mean, I like to keep my belly rolls down to a minimum of three. Anyways, this place recently made a \"Best Eats\" list so a few friends and I decided to see if its rating was legit. I have to say, I was pretty excited about the fact that you get to check off not only the kind of potatoes you want, but also what kind of cheese, meat, veggies, and sauce you want. And, you get to use a big fat pencil to do the ticking. As a result, I was delighted, and I swear that pencil is now NOT sitting on my desk at home. After a wee think, I decided on my own special poutine, which I must admit, was not very adventurous. However, I did get to witness a friend order cut up Pogo's on his, so I momentarily lived vicariously through him (see line about keeping my belly rolls to a min. of 3).

The poutine was great, the service was super, and in six months when it's time for me to get my poutine fix, I may just avoid the Plateau's poutine hot spot (we all know where I mean) and return to the coolest poutine place in the land - Poutineville!"}
{"text":"Yum!

I loved ordering my custom poutine on the little form. It came out promptly and it was delicious. The cheese curds had that telltale squeak, the gravy was rich, and the fries were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I also opted to get bacon and jalapenos, which just brought the whole thing to another level.

The staff are sweet and friendly, which makes the dining experience even nicer."}
{"text":"After seeing great reviews I decided this was a must do while in Montreal. 
So happy I did. 
Servings were huge. 
I am not a poutine lover but taste was good.
Service was little bit slow."}
{"text":"Had to try the Canadian staple poutine, potatoes, cheese curds, and mushroom gravy.
tastes like mashed potatoes and gravy and a hint of cheese.
Server was extremely friendly and even removed an item that wasnt what we thought.
Chocolate cake is extremely rich and delicious.
Generous servings, would go back to Poutineville again when we go back to Toronto!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better service. Steven was an excellent and extremely informative server.  Not only was he very helpful with menu questions but he was even more knowledgeable about the city of Toronto.  Even gave my fiance and I a private tour of the surrounding area."}
{"text":"Les frites goûtais comme si elles étaient vieilles, sauce trop épaisse , bâtonnets au fromage vraiment décevant (un genre de cheezwhiz à l'intérieur ) cheeseburger goûtais rien et la viande était sèche . Quand on a parler du cheeseburger au serveur , il nous a répondu que lui l'aimais"}
{"text":"Very solid. This is easily one of the most authentic poutine I've tried outside of the province of Quebec [I'm originally from Montreal]. The chicken wings are pretty good too."}
{"text":"I never thought Poutine could be appetizing.  I tried La Banquise previously and wasn't too impressed with the poutine.  Then, I ran into someone who recommended Poutineville and said, \"it's the place locals still love.\"  And she was right!  The food was delicious and the create your own poutine style was fun.  I prefer poutine when I get to choose what's in it."}
{"text":"Delicious steak filet mignon poutine with perfect house-made semi-crunchy smashed potatoes (ecrase de pomme de terre).

Unfortunately when I tried to make my own poutine plate by checking away all my favorite ingredients on the list, it ended up tasting like puke. Warm/melted brie is disgusting."}
{"text":"I went to check them out today for the first time with high expectations.

Unfortunately I ordered the \"shoestring\" fries which are frozen McCain's fries.

When I asked the waiter if they were frozen, he \"went to check\" and then confirmed that they were. If all you serve is poutine, none of your potato options should be frozen. (And the menu did not indicate that they were frozen either.)

Two stars because my partner enjoyed his crushed fries. 

But when I asked if the fries were frozen, and then said that the meal was entirely inedible the waiter did nothing but meekly apologize. No alternate food was given. No discount to the check. Didn't even comp the coke.

They could have solved the problem and had me leave happy by giving me 4$ worth of poutine with another fry type, especially since frozen never should have even been a possibility, but instead they did nothing and have a customer that will not only never return, but will tell her friends not to bother either.

That's a lesson in not only what to put on your menu, but also how to treat your customers."}
{"text":"Having lived down the street from Poutineville for more than a year, my wife and I finally decided to go in. Being fans of poutine we couldn't understand what took us so long to pay them a visit.

Poutineville is the Field of Dreams of Poutine. Essentially, if you build it, they will make it. You can either choose from one of there many preset poutine formats (I didn't even see the General Tao poutine, until I was leaving, but it will be my next order) or you can build your own, which is what my wife and I did. I went with the 3 pepper gravy, goat's cheese, fromage en grain, minced beef, mushrooms, and matchstick fries.

The waitress we had was super nice and explained to us how it works to build your very own poutine. The service was super quick and very friendly.

I now need to find 10 friends to come back to the restaurant with me so we can order the 5 pound poutine."}
{"text":"Got the house special, it the hand mashed potatoes were cooked well...crispy on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside. But the brisket was dry and in my opinion, too much cheese. The gravy and red wine sauce was delicious good. Everything about the place was just average."}
{"text":"Went here because I'm sometimes a sucker for things touristy.  With that being said, the poutine here was okay, average.  Lots of variety in toppings but the fries should be crispier not soggy and sad.  The gravy should make my mouth say wow not meh. So I'm giving it a 3 star rating because For a place that's called Poutineville- I expect a great experience and came away with a so-so taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"This place is awesome on so many levels.
I'm not a poutine specialist, but for me the food tasted really good. You have a huge selection of \"toppings\" you can put on your potatoes. Portion sizes are generous for sure. There are premade options as well if you don't know what to get. There's even some $100 poutine dish that could probably feed 50 people! No kidding! My friend eats quite a lot of pouitine in different places and he also said the food's really good!

Service is excellent! We went with a group of 8 people. No problems making reservations, being seated, or getting our meals. The owner,Kosta, actually came and talked to us, and even gave us a special dish on the house. There was always someone around taking care of our orders. In the end we even got our deserts for free. That's exactly the kind of service I hope to receive at any place I go to.

Atmosphere is quite nice. I was expecting a fast food place when I heard of poutine. Couldn't be farther from truth. Music is good, even though a bit loud to my taste. 

I'd definitely go back again, and probably visit their Montreal locations."}
{"text":"My first time here. I was so excited to give it a try since I heard so much about it. It was around 4am (place was open until 5am) and place was about half full. We sat at a table and waited for over 30 minutes, with our glasses of water... I decided to wave to a waitress and told her no one came to take our order yet. She sent another waitress and after order was placed we got our food within 5 minutes. We were both intrigued by the Poutine-pizza, since there is no pictures in the menu, we had imagined that it was a pizza with a Poutine on top of it. And the staff seemed so overwhelmed that we didn't even bother asking when placing the order, since we were just too excited to finally be able to order some food. Poutine showed up, but no pizza. It seems like the \"Poutine-pizza\" is juste served in a flat plate instead of a regular bowl. They had their specialty \"patates écrasées\" (squished potatoes) in both of our dish. Mine was the BBQ version and I liked it. My friend had the \"all-dressed\" and je found it had no particular taste or excitement to it at all.

In a nutshell: Overall, the premises were clean, food served hot, staff overwhelmed and not on the ball but polite, I might be back to try their regular poutines before I make up my mind about his place!"}
{"text":"On a recent visit to Montreal, a friend and I were on a mission for three things; decent coffee, a smoked meat sandwich and of course poutine. On recommendations and internet reviews we headed for Poutineville. Although there were extensive options of poutine toppings we went with the traditional cheese curds and gravy, opting for the specialty potatoes. 
It was delicious. The perfect ratio of cheese to gravy to potatoes. The cheese was soft in some areas and warm and a little rubbery in others,  just the way I like it. The gravy was generous but didn't make the potato soggy. The service was efficient and friendly. Would return and try something more adventurous and get the fries instead of potatoes for comparison."}
{"text":"The first time I tried poutineville, I admit I had high expectations because of all the hype I had heard.  My poutine was fine, not amazing, and the service was mediocre.  There were several factors at play, namely the fact that I had gone with the \"make your own\" option and got really excited about toppings without really thinking things through, and that the people sitting at the table next to us were the clients from hell and I think the wait staff started avoiding our area to avoid those customers.  Totally understandable, they went on and on and on with questions, then had comments about EVERYTHING once the food arrive, then gabbed for so long their poutines were cold and they had to ask to have them heated up for them.  They had other requests that I'm forgetting the details of, but suffice to say they made the waitstaff's lives pretty miserable.

I've been back since, and what a difference!  The staff are super attentive, and I really thought out my combinations of toppings and wow!  So good!  I will definitely be back!  I love being able to pick exactly what I want, right down to the type of fries (I love the smashed fries) and the gravy (every once in awhile I get a hankering for pepper gravy).  

So the next time I'm at Poutineville, if I find myself sitting next to a particularly demanding customers, I'm just going to get up and walk over to the bar to have a chat with the waiter or waitress, and not let a couple of difficult people ruin my SUPER DELICIOUS CUSTOM POUTINE!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Tasty build your own poutine! Second time I've come here. The staff are friendly. Bilingual speaking spot like most of Montreal. You can't go wrong but I'd suggest trying the smoked meat and pulled pork  -they are the way to go. Also try  the house special smashed potatoes; they are so damn good."}
{"text":"We loved it so much, we went back twice during our long weekend trip here. The owner is very nice, the poutine is excellent, and they have great beer on tap. Will definitely be coming back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"The Poutineville poutine is by far the best poutine I've ever tried. The only downside of Poutineville is that they put very little cheese on their poutines."}
{"text":"Excellent. Better than Banquise in my opinion. Go for the classic poutine (always) or give the pogo poutine a try."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place, great drink specials and super staff. Any issues I've had have always been dealt with, with no questions asked, I'm a regular here!"}
{"text":"I went to this place last night and I can the food is de-li-cious! I had the Filet Mignon poutine which was very tasty.

Although the service needs a bit of an improvement. We had to wait for quite a while to get the food and our drinks."}
{"text":"Good poutine. The gravy was well seasoned though a bit heavy on the corn starch or whatever thickening agent they use. We ordered two diff dishes but they tasted very similar. Might have just been the same gravy. I liked that we can choose our toppings. The portions are huge, even for regular. I still ate majority of it, and hated myself afterward. 

I don't know why people love poutine so much though. Fries topped with gravy, meats and cheeses would always be good but that's all it is. I can't compare this with any other poutine I've had as I've never had another. The service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"L'endroit est bien situé sur la rue ontario, accessible via l'autobus Ontario ou l'autobus papineau. Je m'attendais a un genre de comptoir/cantine , mais c'est une belle façade rouge et de vraies tables qui nous attendent au Poutineville. Un bar complet et du service au tables complètent l'expérience. Le serveur était super gentil et drôle, et nous a accomodé avec gentillesse lorsque nous avons ajouté une table pour pouvoir recevoir des amis qui sont arrivés plus tard. 

Apéro : une pinte de cheval blanc super froide contrastant avec la chaleur et l'humidit é de la journée, ça a vraiment fait du bien. Le menu varié a tenté plusieurs de mes compatriotes pendant que moi j'ai choisi les ingrédients a la carte : frites écrasés (la spécialité maison), fromage cheddar, boeuf haché, piments verts et oignons caramélisés. délicieux !

Le prix est un peu élevé pour une poutine, mais la fraîcheur des ingrédients et le service impeccable en ont valu le coup."}
{"text":"Usually I'm used to small, cramped, dirty poutine joints but Pountineville was a surprisingly spacious and comfortable restaurant.  The food itself is great and the portions are huge.  Though there are many poutine options on the menu already, you can also make your own custom poutine.  There are a variety of options for vegan/gluten free/vegetarian and even a wine gravy?! I was super excited to try it.

Unfortunately for my party, the waitress forgot part of our order for a pretty long time on a late afternoon time (restaurant was 1/3 full only).  I understand mistakes are made but she rarely came back to check up on us or looked our way at all.  This takes away from the experience slightly, but the food itself was still amazing."}
{"text":"I've been to this place on numerous occasions and have always had good customer service. I stick to the house special with the braised beef and it's delicious. I've done take-out a few times and I never had to wait more than 10 minutes for my food; even had the chance to chat with the owner of the place who seems like a really cool guy. The regular portion size is more enough for the average person,  go one up from that and you'll have left overs for sure. Overall great poutine, good customer service, and great ambiance with ample seating if you plan on dining in."}
{"text":"Ok, as a Stateside Southern boy from Georgia, I had never heard of poutine before visiting Montreal for the first time last week. I remember one of my colleagues described it this way, \"Ok, dude, they take french fries and smother them in gravy...\"  I didn't bother listening the rest of the list of things piled up on this little (or big, as the case may be) mound of heaven.  He had me at \"gravy\".  Three days later, we managed to tear ourselves away from the conference to find Poutineville, which was reported to be the best place to indulge. I'm pleased to report it was. I opted for the crushed potatoes  (for my stateside bretheren, that's fried home fries crushed and fried a second time), mozzarella, bacon, olives, and that beautiful brown poutine gravy goodness. 

Long story short, I ate them with relish and spent the afternoon wallowing in a bittersweet mix of pleasure and regret. Don't think, just go and try for yourself. Remembering the experience while writing this report makes me want to take a nap, so if you'll excuse me....Zzzzzzzzzz."}
{"text":"Have been here twice and both times I really liked the meal.  Tried to come here on a Saturday night and the line was way out the door.  

Slightly out of the way place for a tourist, but way better experience that in downtown.  The area around it looks like it would be fun to explore in the Summer too!"}
{"text":"We got there right before a huge rush and was seated right away. The atmosphere is really nice but is a little bit loud. I love their build your own pouting option, and the sangria is very delicious"}
{"text":"Poutine poutine
It's quebec cuisine
Crushed potatoes, cheese & gravy
Eating it you can't be lazy!

Poutineville makes it the best
Custom order, then you rest 
Very filling, veggies, meat
With a price that can't be beat!"}
{"text":"OMG SO MUCH CARBS! But so delicious and saucy at the same time. The staff are pretty easy going about customizing your order and the portion-to-price is very reasonable. The fries are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside - just the way it should be :)"}
{"text":"Delicious. Everything. Got the original and the steak with mushroom. Both were outstanding. Service was a little slow but worth the wait. And friendly! What a welcome meal on our first trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Crushed potato style poutine was delicious and crunchy, unfortunately the same doesn't go for the bacon on it.
Initially had to wait for someone to seat us  because they were too busy talking to each other, and there were so many empty tables so no reason to keep us waiting."}
{"text":"My poutine daydreams turned into reality thanks to Poutineville. The atmosphere is a welcoming mixture of fancy and casual with the dark decor and dim lighting. 

Most of the dishes look like slop, if we're being honest, but slop has never tasted so darn good. They give you a menu with some of their options and also a sheet with a checklist that allows you to come up with your own creation. I ordered the Farmer's something or another which is crispy potatoes topped with cheese curds, chicken, bacon, potatoes, and I subbed the poutine sauce for peppered sauce that the server recommended for a less gravy-like option. Everyone at my table ordered something different and everyone loved every last bite. The small size is more than enough for one person! 

My eyes are watering remembering how perfectly executed this sophisticated junk-food experience was. Next time I'll create my own just because I realized that pogo = corndog and I can only imagine what poutine masterpiece I can create knowing this."}
{"text":"The yelp hype didn't lie. My friend and I went here and the line was LONG! 

We ordered the farmers delight  to share which was about $15 for a large. It came with chicken bacon tomatoes fresh cheese curds and gravy. To be honest, we were expecting more flavour. It was kind of bland and had a strange after taste. 

The service however was friendly and fast. No small talk and straight to the business (which is excellent when you're starving). 

Overall would I order the same dish again or recommend it? Nope 

Would I come here again to try something else? Definitely. All this hype must be for a reason!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in Montreal so how can you  not have a poutine while you are here

The poutine was delicious.  The fries were not soggy but crispy and soft on the inside.  The gravy was light in the texture but very flavorful and the cheese was fresh.   Wash it down with a great local beer like Cheval Blanc and you have a great combo 

Service was a little slow considering there was nobody else in the restaurant but other than that would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"It was very good, but one of our poutines came out wrong. The building has a modern setup and design, very well done with a small outdoor seating area. The staff were great, helpful and happy. They have a \"build your own\" poutine option, which looks fun, but can get pricey quickly. We got the house poutine which was great. The red-wine gravy was fresh and unique, and the shredded beef was perfectly cooked, not dried out. We also got the Philly cheese-steak poutine which wasn't as good. Looking back at the menu, I realized they forgot to put cheese curds and the gravy on it, which would have changed everything!! All we got was the nacho cheese on it, which was overbearing - mixing it with cheese curds and gravy would have balanced it out. I didn't realize it at the restaurant, only just noticed it by re-reading their menu on the website."}
{"text":"Really great place. The waiters were on point and the food as awesome. 

You can make your poutine!!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes dreams do come true.... It doesnt get any better than full on poutine customization and no one does it better."}
{"text":"Sadly this place is just a tourist trap with mediocre food. If you're looking to try a good poutine, there are many amazing places in Montreal but unfortunately this isn't one of them. We heard bad reviews but had to give this place a chance since it's always packed.

The two different poutines we tried were not good - the fries were similar to frozen store bought McCain fries, definitely not freshly cut and made in house from fresh potatoes. We also ordered mozzarella sticks, which turned out to be filled with Cheese Whiz (gooey orange synthetic stuff) instead of mozzarella. 

If you want a real good greasy poutine and meal, you're better off going to a diner like Belle Pro or Lafleur!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  And so good for you (not)!  Real authentic poutine in a Montreal neighbourhood. Was perfect. Delicious poutine and a perfect setting."}
{"text":"We made a pitstop in Montreal and came across Poutineville. I got to say, I dig this place. You get to customize your poutine but I went with the house poutine. Yummy!! My girlfriend got the veggie burger and she liked it a lot. I can see Guy Fieri from diners drive-ins and dives doing a segment on here. It's got that cool vibe with great food. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Poutineville was one of my stops in search of good food during my short and sweet trip to Toronto.  Personally for me, in order to get a real sense of a good traditional poutine, there was no way I would not hesitate to have this popular dish in the Motherland of Poutine which I would like to call Canada even though it is the de facto dish of choice in Montreal.  What sets Poutineville apart from others in the GTA is the fact that you can make your own custom poutine.  I ordered a poutine with crushed potatoes, original gravy, cheese curds and the braised beef everyone talks about.  The portions were good enough to last the whole day or two.  Despite the neighbourhood it is located in, Poutineville makes a good sit down restaurant, especially for a date.  They also have an AYCE menu with 5 poutine options.  Parking is a hit or miss unless you are taking Uber or public transit.  The server was friendly and made the experience something to remember.  I will be back next time I adventure north of the border.  I will be having my poutine with a glass of wine bundled up in a warm jacket."}
{"text":"Before my wife and I even left America and came to Montreal we looked online to see what types of dishes we had to try.  Poutine was front in center as a Canadian staple that we would have to try.  What did we do, straight to Yelp of course, there is no better way to find what you're looking for.  

When we came across Poutineville we knew we had a gem.  The number of review done and the photos posted on Yelp sold the restaurant to us.  We entered the small but modern restaurant and sat down eager to try our first taste of a Canadian classic.  We ordered two to ensure we got the full effect of the poutine experience.  The first was the farmers delight.  A classic poutine with golden French fires, poutine sauce and cheese curds. However, the addition of grilled chicken, succulent bacon and fresh tomato put it over the top.  Having only heard the stories of squeaky curds I was happy to learn that they were not myths but truths.  The other we ordered was a little bit of a different take.  A sweet potato fry, with pepper gravy and cheese curds.  The sweet potato fries are obvious and delicious.  The pepper greave was simply amazing.  A nice dark gravy with a silky smooth texture and nice peppery back drop on the sauce.  The cheese curds were the same as our other and were just as good.
Overall, Poutineville is everything that you might assume by the name.  With dozens of possibilities there is sure to be something for everyone. If any of their pre-picked poutine orders don't suit you, they have the option to custom make your own.  Without a doubt, you cannot come to Montreal and not get poutine. So why not go to Poutineville."}
{"text":"This was my first poutine experience and it did not disappoint. This place has a great vibe with friendly wait staff. There's a variety of poutine options as well as the option to design your own. We ordered the poutineville house special and the large was enough to split between 2 people and still have some left over. Our waiter recommended the home fries instead of traditional fries and they were delicious. The cheese curds were squeaky as they should be. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We were a little wary initially since this is starting to look like a chain. But fear not, the poutine is delicious! We had a traditional and a house special, both were amazing. Portions are large and prices are reasonable. No wait when we went on Sunday night."}
{"text":"Excellentes frites. Choix de sauces variées. On choisit ce qu'on met dans notre Poutine ou on choisit une de leur menu. On aime le choix d'ingrédients disponibles, mais le prix est élevé pour une Poutine. 
 
Je préfère la banquise."}
{"text":"Un classique du Canada.La vraie poutine c'est du fromage en grain et non fondu!!C'est bon et ça tiens bien au corps.J'en ai pris une petite et j'ai eu du mal à la finir.A essayer au moins une fois."}
{"text":"First time here will so be back next time in Montreal so many choices to pick from very reasonable in price"}
{"text":"I love poutine so I'm always happy to hear of a great poutine place.  We tried this a few months back and we were blown away!  We have come back many times after that, always for take out though so this review does not include in-restaurant service and experience.  So far I've always ended up ordering the \"create your own poutine\" a feature that I love.  The crushed fries are phenomenal, the toppings abundant and the cheese and gravy delicious.  It is some of the most flavourful and yummy I have  had. 
The wait time for it has varied from time to time, sometimes faster than others. The staff taking our order has also varied, the first we went everyone was super nice, welcoming and friendly, the last 2 times no so much (therefore the 4 stars).  Will definitely keep going back.  :)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

Came again to create my own poutine and wasn't as blown away this time.
There were at maximum 10 people inside when our group came in and I feel that some aspects of the restaurant could be improved. It is super dark inside and I am not sure why the ambiance is like this, though I noticed that there are a lot of light fixtures overhead. Service is friendly which is awesome. However our group of 10 put in our orders and we were told that they would send our orders to the kitchen in two batches \"to not overwhelm the kitchen.\" I don't know why the kitchen can't order 10 orders of poutine. There are just variations of one another. And making 10 poutines one after another is better than sending 5 out at a time with a 10 minute interval in between, to avoid one group is almost done eating while the other half is still waiting for their poutine--this is what happened to us. Also we found random pieces of ingredients from each other's poutines mixed into ours (I had a red pepper, my friend got a mushroom, etc.)...so if you happen to have an allergy, be wary eating in groups. 

18% added gratuity for groups, which I think is quite steep for what it is. 

The food quality itself is good. As mentioned before, the regular size is quite big and filling which is awesome. Love having the different cheeses altogether. And crushed potatoes are still the way to go."}
{"text":"First time Poutine eater, first time in Canada. Call this part of a series - \"A Southerner   Abroad - North of the North\"

So, after settling an argument with my fiancee (I TOLD her it was poo-teen NOT poo-tyne) on the name of the dish, I settled on Poutineville as our first chance to try this regional specialty.

Why Poutineville? Several reasons: (1) my Canadian Yelp friends thought highly of it, and they know more about poutine than me; (2) it is only a short walk from the Royal Ontario Museum, which was the highlight of our Toronto trip; (3) the original location is in Montreal, so, even if this place offers unconventional variations on poutine, they obviously have a pedigree.

Poutineville is on a side street off the main drag where the ROM is. It looked pretty humble from the outside, but had a well-appointed dining room. We were greeted promptly by a friendly guy who seemed to be someone of authority - owner, GM, shift manager, something. We were seated and brought menus. I ordered the pizza pountine because everyone on here enjoyed it so much, while my fiancee got the traditional poutine, so we could say we had something closer to the \"original recipe\" before we started experimenting with the crispy.

The food was brought out quickly. It was pretty good! It was only the second-weirdest thing I ate on this trip, easily bested by the bizarre concoction down south known as \"Cincinnati Chili\" (get this - it's spaghetti noodles covered with the wateriest chiili you've ever tasted plus onions, beans, and piles of shredded cheddar).

Anyway, the pizza poutine was very tasty, as was the traditional poutine. Frankly, the cheese curds, something I'd never had before, started getting to me as I dug in, but ultimately I ate everything off my plate that wasn't potatoes - there were simply too many to eat them all.

The bathrooms are down the stairs, so a little bit tricky for some folks to get down there to use the head. The atmosphere was the sort of hip thing I'd expect from downtown Toronto - loud music videos from the 80s - present playing. I did see one where a woman was topless and uncensored, which was shocking to my Puritanical sensibilities - at least that I was seeing this at a family restaurant.

Bottom-line: Poutineville is a creative twist on this bit of Quebecois soul food - I would definitely return if I was in the area, as this place is good for a poutine-newbie as well as someone who grew up eating the stuff but wants a new take. That said, if/when I find myself back in the GTA, or in Francophone Canada, I would like to try some different poutine places also."}
{"text":"This restaurant single-handedly made up for twenty years of hating poutine with a passion. Out with the mushy fries in rehydrated brown sauce and the suspiciously chewy cheese, in with choice ingredients: crunchy potatoes, caramelized onions, beef fillet, blue cheese, and home made gravy. Another happy accident! Thank you Poutineville!"}
{"text":"With a name like \"Poutineville\" and also the fact that it's a chain, I was a little worried that the poutine would be very generic and gimmicky--this wasn't the case. You have the choice of creating your own poutine or choosing one of their specialities. We went with ordering the specialties, the pulled pork poutine, because I'd imagine the cost could get a little out of control when ordering your own. It was exactly what I expected and more. The combination of flavors was like a party in your mouth. The addition of brie is genius. The only downfall was service wasn't so good. When I have to glance around for my server multiple times during a meal, that's when my rating goes down."}
{"text":"3 stars all the way. We went in a group of 4 tonight and though it was okay, definitely nothing special.

The $15 Ayce after 5 on Tuesdays seemed like a good deal. You get to choose from 5 options and they give you taster sized portions. The problem is, the five options are blah. The spicy one is cool cuz it comes with a chicken wing fried on top but 2/5 options don't even offer cheese curds. I mean come on.

I think the best part of dinner were the fried pickles.

The worst part of it was definitely the obnoxious screaming loud dance based top 40 hits. 

We came here because we were suggested to go here in Sherbrooke quebec. However right when we were about to go, all the locals said the poutine there was mediocre and it's more of a bar-ish atmosphere than about the food and took us to a local spot. Probably should've gotten the hint then!"}
{"text":"My class was about to graduate so we went down the street to Poutineville to celebrate. They offered free beer to me because I called to make a reservation for a large group (I don't drink beer so I got a nutella pizza dessert instead, yum!)

They give you a menu where you check the boxes off for your choices, and for the amount of people we were, the food came quite fast. Service was excellent, food was amazing, everything went very well. It's a little pricey but you get a lot of poutine."}
{"text":"Great spin on poutine. Basically you can take the original poutine and put your own spin on it. Fast service, overpriced wine. Food was hot, tasty, and original! Not a must see if a tourist, but great if you want to try something different"}
{"text":"I went to try the general tao poutine (it was for the poutine week so i don't know if they will always do that) the poutine i ate is the one with couple of chicken nugget with a  bit of tao gravy. 

It was good but i'm a still a fan of the good old poutine and Benny BBQ is the best restaurant for a poutine, the bad news is that there's only in Longueuil, but i think if you're near jacque-cartier bridge it's just at the second exit (curé poirier ) you just have to passed under the overpass, and it's just at the first street at your right (ste-foy street).



J'ai été essayer la poutine général Tao (faite spécialement pour la semaine de la poutine je ne sais pas si il vont continuer à en faire après). La  poutine que j'ai mangée étaient celle avec quelque croquette de poulet et un peu de sauce général tao.


C'était bon, mais je suis toujours un fan de la bonne vielle poutine et le restaurant Benny  BBQ est le meilleur en fait de poutine. LA mauvaise chose est que vous pouvez trouver ce restaurant seulement à Longueuil, mais si vous êtes près du pont Jacques Cartier c'est seulement la 2 ème sortie en sortant du pont  vous passez en dessous du viaduc avant la lumière et c'est juste au coins de la rue Ste-Foy à votre droite (derrière le Esso)."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed our experience here. We went in the afternoon when it wasn't very busy and received our food within 10 minutes of ordering. Philly Steak poutine was incredible. We also ordered The Godfather which was good, but probably wouldn't order it again. Loved our first real poutine experience!"}
{"text":"This place was good. Was it fantastically amazing? Probably not. We walked in and was casually greeted and told to sit anywhere with a table for two. Welcoming was minimal. No drink orders were even taken. We walked in at 5pm and there were just two other tables. 

Our table ordered the Godfather and burger with brie cheese. The burger was pretty good. The brie cheese was definitely an amazing touch. Melt in your mouth brie with extra mayo on the side. The patty itself was pretty thick. 

The poutine itself was also good. Tons and tons of cheese. The cheese curds did melt a lot though. I though real cheese curds didn't melt so easily or at all? I could be wrong. The eggplant was marinated and \"roasted\" but it tasted really sour and soggy. Overall, the poutine was a bit more sour than my liking and tastes like sour pizza toppings. 

Overall experience was \"meh\". Very minimal service. No smiles."}
{"text":"Was very excited to go to their Tuesday night $15 buffet. Though they have gluten free, vegan, and vegetarian gravy, their toppings are pre-mixed and was not suitable for me to eat as a vegetarian. I was disappointed and thought it was questionable for a poutine place to have things pre mixed. 

Food: I got their large poutine with thick cut fries, onions, green peppers, and mushrooms. I was pretty full and ate the rest of a friend's dish (I can eat a lot). 

Service/ambiance: the servers were friendly but confusing. We were seated at the back and I could barely see what I was eating, I had to use my cell phone light to get a closer look. 

Overall: I'd come here again for their regular poutine. I'm disappointed that their ayce is not as gf/veg/vegan friendly as their gravy."}
{"text":"I tried the house special. It is good. but I think I prefer regular fries to their special ones...the special ones are way too crispy and I could not really feel that I was eating fries or potatoes."}
{"text":"Poutine with Filet Mignon. #winning!"}
{"text":"For a poutine restaurant, this is pretty much as good as it gets. Humongous portions with reasonable prices, amazing flavor combinations and tons of delicious cheeeeeeeeeeeeese. When you feel like you need to be a real quebecois, come here and fill yourself with delicious poutine."}
{"text":"Poutine is...well...poutine. Potatoes, cheese curds, and gravy. They have a massive selection to choose from to create your own. Wife had the \"Zeus\", and I had the house special. Overall, they were good. Place is cramped, and we went on a Saturday, which made it a little more cramped. We would eat here again, mainly because we can get just about any variety of poutine we can think of."}
{"text":"Meilleure poutine de la ville. 
Tres peu d'attente. Service rapide. Portion copieuse et pas trop grasse (rare pour une poutine)"}
{"text":"Best Poutine a Montréal ! La poutine avec les frites écrasés est vraiment incroyable ! 
Honnêtement, c'est rare que je peu dire qu'une poutine ce démarque, mais à cette endroit elle est vraiment extra ! Bref, vous devez vraiment essayer ce petit spot !"}
{"text":"Lemme start with this: I love Poutineville. The location on Ontario gave me my first poutine AND my first meal after I got engaged, so it has a special place in my heart. That being said, I was pretty disappointed the one time I went to this location. It was a colder evening, and we walked in the rain after getting a bit turned around, so we were looking forward to good hot plates of food. Sadly, that isn't what we got. 

After some waiting and confusion because of the language barrier, we were seated. The restaurant was busy at the time so we were patient, and the server was patient with us. He was kind enough and I thought we communicated alright. But much to our dismay, after we placed our orders, the food arrived cold. Like, my cheese curds didn't even BEGIN to melt kind of cold. I'm not sure how this is happened, since the gent next to me had super stringy melty cheese. I jokingly say it's because we couldn't speak French and we messed something up while ordering, but I digress. It was still tasty, but would have been better hot, of course.

It was sad for us since, as stated, my fiancee and I LOVE the location on Ontario. This one is MUCH closer to my fiancee's apartment so we were excited, but after this incident, we took the metro out and made the walk to Ontario instead. I'd like to give this spot a try again in the future, hopefully with better results."}
{"text":"A girlfriend brought me here for my first Quebec poutine experience. She sold it as her second favorite poutine place. 

My game plan was simple: go the traditional route. Since I was planning on tackling the plate by myself, I ordered the regular size. I built my custom poutine with regular fries, gravy and curds, but added grilled onions for a slight deviation. We checked ahead of time to make sure there was a vegetarian gravy, and to my delight, we discovered that all the sauces were vegetarian, except for the meat sauce. 

My plate arrives and I go to town. (I'm not good dating material) I figured the gravy would sog up my fries and I didn't want to give it a chance to do so. The gravy was tasty, but I wished the fries were cooked longer to hold up better to the gravy. The most satisfying thing about the whole dish was the squeaky cheese curds. I looked up from my empty plate to discover that my two dainty dates were unable to finish their equally sized dishes. Oh well, I win."}
{"text":"From N.Y. and was told to try poutine and smoked meat in Montreal. Had the smoked meat sandwich with poutine as the side. They were awesome. Glad i had both here. The beer was great and the service was also really good. Our server was a gentleman whose name I forgot (sorry guy) but was great to us. He also brought me a shot on the house. I had the 911 wing as well. The sauce is delicious but no where near spicy. I would highly recommend this place. PS. for those who don't know, poutine is the Canadian version of disco fries."}
{"text":"Poutineville is a great place for someone who has never experience poutine before as they are pretty much standard and are good quality. There are multiple locations across Montreal. There is a large range of seating and a very large menu. My only compliant is that I feel it is a bit over priced for some items and the portion size."}
{"text":"Not much to say but amazing poutine, reasonable portion for price. Very customizable, lots of variety of items to add to your poutine. It's very popular so expect a wait before getting seats. 
Warning about the large size option for the poutine... its a LOT of food, even if you manage to finish it in 1 meal you will probably feel gross."}
{"text":"A relaxed atmosphere especially on a sunny afternoon and is a great place to come after drinks. The staff are very welcoming and attentive at most times but the can be come a bit distracted when it gets busy. The food is very good comfort food with large portions that you can definitely share. With my group we tried the Montrealer and the House Special as well as a create your own option using a special paper menu they give you. The drinks are reasonably priced and they have a good selection of sangria to chose from. Parking in the area can be tricky to come by so I would recommend grabbing a bus which lets you out close by. As of May 2018 it's $3.25 for adults and $2.25 for those over six for the bus fair."}
{"text":"Very good poutine!  Ordered the Poutineville and Montrealer.  

The crispy edges of the crushed potatoes with the Poutineville created a pleasant texture while still being a hearty foundation to the Cheese curds, mozzarella, braised beef and wine sauce.

The Montrealer had the traditional fries along with Smoked meat, mushrooms, swiss cheese, poutine sauce, au gratin and topped with a batter fried pickle.  Appropriately named, you taste Montreal on a plate.

Spoke to one of the Owners who was very nice and passionate about his food and Customers.  I advised him that Poutineville would do very well in Toronto."}
{"text":"Es increíblemente deliciosa , he probado muchas en Canada en varias partes de aquí y pienso q es de las mejores. Recomiendo al 100% asistir aquí. Todas las personas que visitan Montreal visitan este lugar para comer Poutine."}
{"text":"Had a great time here! We had two custom poutines and they were absolutely delicious!
One had steak meat on it and the meat was amazingly cooked which made the poutine so much better. Just the right proportion of fries, gravy and cheese which toppings that made my mouth water!!

Next time I'm on montreal, definitely visiting this place again!"}
{"text":"Poutine poutine poutine...can I get a woohoo for poutine?  I've tried poutine in Vancouver before and I didn't see what the hype was all about but the poutine at this place is AMAZING!

I highly recommend the original.  Damn the beef in it is sooo good that I'd snuggle with it! I tried the sweet potato poutine too which sounds kind of weird, but it was pretty good and wasn't weird at all.  And they open late...hooray for an after drinking snack."}
{"text":"It would be sacreligious to visit Montreal without getting some poutine. I've had a few poutine experiences throughout Canada and even visited some wannabe places in the States. They are typically hole in the walls, but what would you expect when ordering fries topped with gravy and cheese?

I was pleasantly surprised to find that Poutineville was a pretty nice restaurant. And even more pleasantly surprised to discover that they let you make your own poutine. You get to pick the fries, type of sauce, toppings, etc. This place should be renamed Poutine Heaven! Speaking of heaven they also serve fried pickles here, which is every pregnant woman's dream. 

I was happy that our waiter spoke English so he could help me navigate this new poutine world. I chose sweet potato fries, red wine sauce, a variety of vegetable toppings and even some bacon.  It was absolutely delicious! The red wine sauce was a bit gravyish for my taste, but guess that's to be expected since poutine is typically topped with gravy sauce.

One of my dining companions mentioned she was never able to finish the massive \"small\" order of poutine, but have to admit I did a good job finishing mine thanks to the future linebacker currently living my stomach."}
{"text":"i thoroughly enjoyed my food, good poutine, good gravy, chewy fresh curds. We ordered this via justeat so i can't comment on the location or service, but based on the food i would return and would definitely consider dropping by in person. fresh chewy curds are delish, definitely one of the better poutines in the city, wasn't the absolute best i've ever had but it was definitely good an worth your money."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just me but I could barely get through my poutine. Maybe i'm just not a huge fan but I did not think it was good at all. I was very surprised after seeing so many highly rated reviews but maybe it's just me."}
{"text":"YOO this place has the BEST poutine everrr i cried 300 times while eating my poutine 
our server was really nice and the place is very nice looking 
can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Poutine since I heard about it on American TV (Modern Family). Finally I go to visit my cousin in Montreal and she brings my other cousin and I here. This was by far was the most decadent thing I've had in my lifetime.
We have a Poutine place here in Boston, but I'm telling you right now, it does poutine a disservice.
The staff was great. They let my other cousin, who had never heard of poutine, taste the curds.
I had the Steak Philly. Sweet Baby Jesus it was fantastic. The 3 of us had 3 different versions of poutine and it was amaze-balls.
I have to visit Montreal again (unless you guys ship, PLEASE) just to get poutine. 
For my first time eating genuine poutine... the next place will be hard to live up to.

Its 8 for the Small and 10 for the large... if you choose a regular poutine. More for the signature dishes. And if you are Making your own, it gets a little pricey after the free stuff, but worth it. The size of the small... you can eat it at least 3x's if you're not greedy. If you're me, then 2x's."}
{"text":"I went there very late in the evening on Saturday and still there were people in this restaurant. Restaurants around parc close much earlier and it is a big plus for this one. I liked the fact that the basic gravy is vegan (tried to convince them to tell me the recepie but wasn't successful ). They offer vegan cheese which is shredded over the potatoes (l liked cubes, apparently it is more expensive). Hand-crushed house style potato for fries is my favorite. Their poutine is the best vegan poutine I've tried so far. Will definitely go there again. The staff were friendly and respectful."}
{"text":"Atmosphère décontractée, personnels super sympathique et accueillant, malgré l'heure de fermeture nous ont reçue malgré tout... Bonne présentation , original, choix abondant de garnitures à poutine ou autre, bon,environement propre, agréable et advenent... Je vous conseil à découvrir,  pour moi , belle découverte et le mayonnaise à l'ail avec les frites hummm vraiment bon  (^_^)
amis présent avec moi très satisfait, a retourner pour sûr  ^-^/"}
{"text":"If you're new to poutine its easy:  fried potatoes, cheese curds, gravy.  Been around the block before?  Then go ahead and craft your own.  Poutineville has over 40 ingredients allowing you to come up with endless combinations for your very own custom poutine.

This was my first visit here to Poutineville and many years have passed since I've been to Montreal.  I didn't want to keep it simple and ordered the Poutinville- which is hand crushed potatoes, cheese curds and very melty mozzarella with braised beef in a red wine gravy.  Sounds Michelin right?  It tastes even better than it sounds.  

There are other options on the menu but when in Quebec do as the Québécois and get a poutine.  Any of them.  You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"IN SHORT:  4.25/5
Good valued delicious variety of poutine in Montreal that opens late (till midnight to 5 a.m) that also has good sandwiches.

FOOD:  4.25/5
Multiple permutations of poutine offered along with selections of burgers and sandwiches.
POUTINE SAMPLER ($11) - Although the menu says poutine with wine sauce, it appears to be the poutine that I know from everywhere else, tasty and not boozy.  The second part of the sampler is the sweet potato version. The sweetness imparts a very different experience.  Delicious.
GYRO SANDWICH ($9+2) - Slices of gyro meat in two slices of grain bread with lettuce.  It comes with a side of red cabbage and an upgraded house side salad with tomatoes, cucumber, lettuce, graded cheese and a salty, briny, pickled vegetable.  The gyro meat is good and the strong acidity of the salad countered the richness of poutine. Otherwise, dressing on the side may be better for a palate less tolerant of lots of vinegar. 

AMBIANCE / SERVICE:  3/5
Although it's a tight space with intruding onversation from neighboring table, the furniture is comfortable and the window view of the passers by of the street is nice.  Service is good.

LOCATION / PARKING:  3.5/5
Parking is metered city street

WHEELCHAIR ACCESS:  3/5

{"text":"It's fantastic poutine, tons of choice, at a good price, in a great atmosphere, with friendly staff, and drinks. Really, what's not to like ?"}
{"text":"This was my second time ever trying Poutine and I'm glad I tried it from here. I had the regular poutine with smoked meat and it was delicious, the small portion was good and the meat was so tender and tasty, the cheese curds squeeked when you chew them, and the potatoes were really good too. The halfpitcher of sangria is huge and the wine they use is not weak. Their prices seem fair too. The minus one star was because they forgot the bacon on my burger."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by poutine. They have a nice variety of choices. The House Special poutine was my favorite. The service was good and plenty of room for our party of six."}
{"text":"It was our first time trying poutine and the food was pretty good. It tastef exactly like was it is but the poutine sauce wsd good. The place was packed but the service was still good. I got the Farmers Market and my husband got the Fire Breather. I think poutine is just not my thing."}
{"text":"Franchement pour une première cette Poutine la jvai en parler pendant longtemp. La formule a faire soit même est géniale on rajoute se qu on veut comme on veut c'est parfait ambiance parfaite serveur sympas que demande le peuple franchement n'hésitez pas allez y c'est vraiment bon"}
{"text":"This place is good!
My boyfriend ordered the house special with the red-wine and beef. It was unique, a little bitter from the wine, if you like that.
I custom-made a poutine. After tasting mine, I think a good combination would have been sweet potato + cheese curds + bacon + onions.
Service was fast and friendly at 2 am on a touristy Friday."}
{"text":"Lecker! Gerichte schnell serviert und preiswert (eine reguläre Portion macht satt). Es gibt vegetarische und vegane Optionen (alle Soßen bis auf die mit Fleisch ). Die Poutine können auch selbst zusammen gestellt werden. Und dazu kommt das ganze aus der Region"}
{"text":"This place has very good poutines and one of the specialities of this place is that you can completely customize your poutine. We ordered the mignonne poutine which was very good. The only problem with it was that some of the mignonnes were raw on one side. When I told it to the waiter, he didn't say anything and he did not apologize for it. I didn't like the way he behaved."}
{"text":"We tried this place twice while we were in town and it was wonderful each time. The service is hit or miss on attentiveness, but always friendly, but the food is consistently good, whether you get poutine or anything else."}
{"text":"En voyage à Montréal, je suis passé le dernier soir par Poutineville, après avoir testé La Banquise. Les deux sont très bien, mais le gros avantage de Poutineville est de pouvoir faire sa propre \"création\". 
Lorsqu'on s'assoit à table, on a toute la liste des ingrédients, il suffit de cocher ce que l'on souhaite intégrer, et quelques minutes plus tard ... TADA !

Une poutine énorme, garnie plus que nécessaire et surtout délicieuse ! Les pommes de terre étaient très bonnes, la sauce aussi, même si j'aurais finalement dû opter pour la sauce au poivre qui est à tomber ! 

L'ambiance du restaurant est beaucoup plus simpliste qu'à la banquise, mais fait aussi beaucoup moins \"usine à touriste\", bref, je vous recommande vivement !"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of being served by the owner of the establishment, so of course, the service was great/charming.  The Bacon Cheeseburger was really good; you could fully taste all of it's distinct ingredients. Freshville.  $2 upgrade to the poutine is a safe bet, and MUST do.  Their poutine is really good.  Not as savory as LaBanquise, but the hot fries, beefy gravy and cheese curds marry to each other, and form a nice, sticky little cluster of salty, fatty whatchu-need-ness, and why-you-came-ness.  Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Okay. I will tell you a few things. 

First, I really wanted to like this place. 
Second, I dropped by with 9 friends and acquaintances a few weeks after it opened... and perhaps they were still working out kinks. Still, not really an excuse for what happened.

We arrived on Tuesday, their AYCE day because come on: It is AYCE poutine! YOU HAVE to try THAT experience at least ONCE in your life. 

We were hungry and excited as we waited for a few late comers to our party before ordering and here is where things starting going downhill. 

First, we are given menus as we wait for our friends and we read through those dish descriptions like Oprah on a pie and I am telling you some of the poutines on that menu sounded delicious! 

Except... the options offered for the AYCE  are not those but obviously simpler, cheaper, counterparts not listed online. The truth is, you can't help feeling that you are being the victim of a Bait and Switch. For you see, on their site, there is only one poutine menu on display. Second, a little poster there advertises \"All you can eat -- From 5 signature poutines!\" However, no one takes the opportunity to define what \"Signature poutines\" are until you are there at the restaurant and about to order AYCE. 

\"Alright,\" we said, as our new options... still looked, uh, good, so we order them only to discover the portions are VERY SMALL. 

Look, I get the venue does not want customers wasting food however here it seems more as a topping/money saving strategy as each serving is mostly French fries. 

Also, they serve them in rounds so you can literally be there for 25 minutes and get three maybe four small servings. How do I know that?
Well, I am glad you let me put such question in your mind. 

We began ordering at around 9:30pm and as we were going to order another round, the waitress announces the kitchen is closing and they would not be taking any more orders. I check my phone, it was 9:55pm! Soon thereafter she casually dropped the bill. 

I find it silly that on their site they state the AYCE \"starts\" at 5:00pm but they never tell you when they close, and strategic choice it seems. Heck, even here on Yelp it states their closing time to be 11:00pm on Tuesdays. 

If I had to guess, I think the reason they were closing was because the restaurant was somewhat empty and the person in charge did not want to pay the extra overhead. 

I asked the server, \"Why she did not tell us they were closing early for if they had we would not have gotten the AYCE.\" She had no answer. 
That was annoying. 
I requested to speak with the manager. 

He comes out and he really does not seem to know what to do or seems a little bit baffled about our issue. Personally, I do not think he wanted to do anything but to have us pay and leave.

It is bad when you have to remind a venue that such practice is not appreciated and should not be done to 10 of their brand new customers. 

He then asked, \"What is that you want?\" which I found a bit annoying since what I wanted was to go eat ACYE poutine with my friends and not manage his resolution skills. But since he asked, I suggested that at least he could reduce the bill. He then asked \"By how much?\" Although at Smoke's poutinerie, most dinner-sized  servings --the Chili Cheese Bacon Poutine, for example, cash in at $8.99, I suggested at minimum of $10 per head. Which considering the limited selection, tiny servings of poutine, the fact they were closing without warning after just 25 minutes, the expectation for us to pay full price unless I had to bring it up to the manager and the manager's aloof attitude, I think monetarily speaking, the venue got more than a fair deal. 

Then as we are paying the new bill and getting ready to leave the manager says something akin to \"We are new to the neighborhood, remember to give us a good-word-of-mouth.\" 

Sigh. Maybe he was jesting and trying to defuse a bit of tension? I am not sure, but his tone was not so much joking as it was mildly demanding. As if he had done us a solid by not charging us full price and was now cashing in on the favor. 
Either way, he managed to rub the rest of my party the wrong way. 

Now, I can't tell you what my companions said to their friends but I can tell you that I have not gone back."}
{"text":"The customized poutines are amazing!  Service was prompt, friendly and seating was comfortable.  Their classic poutine is also vegetarian so that really opens up the possibilities!  Not going to lie, even thinking about going back to this place gets me excited.  Make sure you try adding an egg on your poutine, its weird, but it works!"}
{"text":"We came here right before dinner time. The place was not crowded. 

If you like to create your own poutine, this place is definitely worth checking out. They let you create your own poutine. Pick the type of fries, the sauce, & toppings. 

We did not create our own poutine. We got the La Poutinville & the Rocky. La Poutinville is poutin with beef, mozzarella, & wine sauce. The Rocky is poutine with steak, onion, & cheddar cheese. We like the Rocky better than the La Poutinville. The Rocky is very cheesy, just like the Philly Cheesesteak. 

Excellent service! Friendly & attentive waiter! 

Generous portion! 

Definitely worth stopping by!"}
{"text":"Peut etre la meilleure place de poutine en ville... Surtout sans ligne d'attente contrairement a la banquise......

Formule où l'on peut choisir ses ingrédients tels que les frites ècrasées entre autre."}
{"text":"Came here today for their 1 year anniversary $1 deal. I was unimpressed that the portion sizes were relatively small. I felt that they could've been less greedy since its mainly potatoes after all and that barely costs anything.
In terms of the poutine, it was less greasy than most others but then again, it was also less delicious. Fries were a little on the soft side, gravy was just mediocre, and the cheese curds weren't exactly melting (perhaps because the overall dish wasn't too hot). 

Service was pretty good but eh, probably won't be coming back. More a fan of Smoke's."}
{"text":"Frankly, this is more of the \"let's go have a weird poutine\" place than a \"let's go have a good poutine\" place. If you feel like experimenting, why not. But if you feel like having a delicious simple poutine, you'll probably end up underwhelmed like me. 

The Good
+1 for the giant poutine. Neat idea;
+1 one star for having lots and lots of weird poutine options for poutine affectionados like me -- sliced pogo?! Why didn't i think of this before;
+1 for having a simpler menu for novices;
+1 providing free samples of their \"patates ecrasees\" (tried them - not for me).

The Bad
-2 for the terribly slow service at 2PM on a Friday afternoon (10min to get somebody at the table - there was 10 people in the restaurant, and then 20min more for the poutine)
-1 for the quite tasteless regular gravy (911 had a little kick, and was much better, but nothing to write home about)
-1 for the luke-warm patates, and not having so much cheese."}
{"text":"As a native New Yorker and American, I'm entirely new to poutine scene, but this was a grand intro. Poutineville transforms a could be simple experience into something whimsical. Choose a creation from the menu or create your own. 

Layers of house cut fries, smothered in vegetarian gravy, soft and beautiful cheese curds and as many toppings as you'd like. Being my first foray into this magical world of poutine, I played it safe and only added on tomatoes and sautéed onions, and it was delicious! For the more seasoned poutine venturers, the recommended 'house special' style of potato bits seems to be the hit. 

Also quite nice, a decent selection of local drafts on tap. If ever I'm in the Montreal area again, I'll definitely have to stop by."}
{"text":"Dire qu'il y a quelques année, je détestais la poutine, jusqu'à temps que je découvre les poutines avec autre chose que du fromage en grain et de la sauce brune qui donne ben soif! Ah et aussi que je découvre qu'avec du Ketchup, la poutine est 1000 fois meilleure.

Ceci étant dit, j'ai essayé poutineville pour la première fois. Plusieurs poutine étaient dans le menu, mais que fût ma surprise quand je pouvais créer ma PROPRE POUTINE! Et tse ce n'était pas trop cher. En plus, plusieurs choix de sauces. Si vous êtes végé, il y a même de la sauce  qui n'est pas fait à base de viande! Bref, il y en a pour tous les goûts et pas quelques choix plates...non non! Il y a aussi plusieurs autres choix, mais ça reste de la bouffe de gros! 

Ambiance de resto, on ne va pas là pour prendre pleins de verre, par contre j'étais contente de voir qu'ils offraient de la bière en fût. Je sais qu'ils offrent de Unibroue..je ne me souviens pas par contre ce qu'ils offrent d'autre. Bref, une bonne cheval blanc, ça va très bien avec une poutine! 

Le service était un peu lent, mais sans plus! La serveuse était très très gentille! Bref, bien-sûre que j'y retourne, et chapeau à leur patates maisons, elle sont délicieuses! Je sais qu'ils offrent une journée de poutine à volonté...à suivre!"}
{"text":"Meh... I've had better.  Not particularly spectacular, the place is usually packed in the evening."}
{"text":"First time eating poutine, I'm glad I tried this place. I had the classic Poutine, which was pretty awesome. The ambience was very lively and their backyard seating was perfect for the summertime. They had too many options on the menu (which is never a bad thing!) and the variety of artery clogging poutine concoctions seemed too attractive not to try, but unfortunately I could only have one. This place is a must if you're nearby. 
Would not recommend to people who are health nuts and don't want heavy stuff, because it's basically potato fries + gravy + cheese curds. \m/"}
{"text":"Okay so the wine sauce is delicious! I really enjoyed this place a lot. I like how you have the choice to choose what type of potato you want, traditional fries, sweet potato fries, or their famous smashed potatoes (like breakfast potatoes). I was torn between their sweet potato fries and smashed potatoes. But all 5 of us at the table ended up ordering smashed! 

It was really nice that as a vegan I still had a pretty good selection of sauces to choose from since about 4 out of 6 were unintentionally (or not) vegan.

There were also a bunch of toppings you can add on and cheeses besides the curds that you get to choose from. Of course I got the vegan daiya cheese.. which is kind of boring, but not their fault. Hey at least the wine sauce was delicious!"}
{"text":"I was taken to Poutineville for a surprise dinner date with the boyfriend.  Before even stepping into the restaurant I was so excited because poutine is one of my favourite foods. We walked in with reservations and were seated right away.  The ambience of the restaurant is very lively with tvs and upbeat music.  They had a bar upfront where they make the drinks and serve take-out.  Once we were seated, we were greeted by a gentleman, by the name of Kris, I believe his name was.  He explained to us how everything worked at Poutineville.  We were to choose one potato, as many cheeses as you'd like (four which are conplimentary), any toppings we would like (vegetables and meats) and a gravy.  Each topping and meat has a different price point.  We had a Buytopia coupon which included 1 alcoholic beverage, 1 appetizer, 1 poutine, and 1 dessert each!  We decided on beers to start.  For our apps, we decided on Onion Rings and Chicken Wings.  For dessert we went with their Moomoo Cheesecake and Dulce De Leche Cheesecake.  The cheesecakes are both to die for, and I kid you not, the Dulce De Leche Cheesecake is probably one of my favourite cakes, now that I have tasted it how delicious it was.  The poutines were very delicious and portion sizes of all their dishes are definitely shareable.  We had plenty of left overs to take home with us and both of us were so full by the time we finished half our poutines.  Make sure you walk in starved and check Poutineville out.  Have fun with customizing your own poutine, your own way!"}
{"text":"My first visit to Poutineville was quite a disappointment in the service area, but the poutine is great and the service has definitely improved. Love the decor. Good atmosphere. Fun for meeting up with friends!"}
{"text":"Saturday

I came here for the first time for my birthday and had a great experience. It was not very busy which I didn't mind. My party seemed to enjoy their poutine, but I was the only one that actually ate everything (Large)! I customized my base poutine with chicken, bacon, mushrooms, sauteed onions, swiss cheese and roasted red peppers. It was excellent. It can get very pricey if you keep adding toppings. The free slice of chocolate cake for my birthday was generous in size. Lastly, the waitress was very kind. Although she kept asking me if I wanted to buy more drinks, it wasn't too bothersome. I'm glad she saved me from embarrassment not singing the birthday song. I wish I had tipped extra on top of the group gratuity. Thank you Ashley and Poutineville!"}
{"text":"I have visited a Montreal location and here's the deal: this place is better. The restaurant is bigger and less crowded (in a good way) but the food is the same. The one and only thing I liked better about the Montreal location is that the smashed potatoes are bite-sized. Get the red wine gravy - so. good."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, I swear!
I'm a huge advocate of too much cheese and so much gravy you can slurp it with a spoon ...
However this place did not hit the spot :( 

MOSQUITO to drink 
- sounded like a good concept, my two favorite.  Moscato wine and mojito. Nope. Just no.

 Montrealer 
- only reason why this place got 2 stars. It was filled over the top with cheesy goodness, meat galore, and great tasting gravy!

Farmer's delight
- the last time I'm gonna try to be 'healthier'. The tomato made it taste fishy and weird . The gravy was not the same as the Montrealer...kind of smelt like the farm (I guess the name is as suggested  woops!) 

COMBO platter
- onion rings were great, huge and crispy
- mozzarella sticks were bland tasting..outside shell was bland
- deep fried pickles were frozen then microwaved or something. One was still frozen.. told the waiter and he took it away....threw out the evidence and POOF! Silence. It was like nothing ever happened. 
- it came with a spicy ranch sauce and a salsa that I swear came right from Tostito 

Anywho, still in search of 2/3 of my deep fried pickle if anyone finds it.

Will I come back or nah. 
The answer is: or nah."}
{"text":"Scared to try poutine, but being tourists and hearing so much about it, we dove on in. We had heard so much about Poutineville from my boyfriend's extensive research on Montreal, we just had to go there! It absolutely did not disappoint!!! Walked in to a cool, hip little spot, as the normal patrons seemed to be college age or mid 20s, and we were waited on by a very helpful, courteous, and patient waitress. We don't know French or poutine, so this was incredibly helpful. Great that we found the English side of the menu too. We got the sampler dish of poutine: regular potato \"chunks\" with gravy and cheese curds and then sweet potato fries with a pepper sauce and cheese curds. Absolutely delicious, and made us a believer in this Montreal delicacy that we continued to explore over the ensuing weekend. Definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Si je devais choisir un dernier repas avant de mourir se serait une Poutine de Poutine ville Biensure !
Pourquoi ?! Pouvoir concevoir sa propre Poutine et se faire appeler \"Hulk\" \"Oron Man \" etc ca n'a pas de prix.
Vous pouvez mettre tout ce que vous souhaitez dedans. On commence par le chois des patates. Vous voulez l'incontournable ? Les patates écrasé crousti fondant comme j'aime les appelé. Ensuite le fromage vous pouvez rester classique avec le fromage en grain ou bien choisir une montagne. J'opte surtout pour le fromage Nachos fondus. Miam miam. On choisit les légumes. La viande avec un choix large. A tester : steak phily, viande fumé. Vous pouvez même mettre les 2 ! Et enfin la sauce. Encore une fois vous pouvez rester traditionnelle ou vous laisser tenter par l'incroyable sauce au vin. Et la touche finale ?! La crème sure bien entendu !
Sur ce maintenant que je vous ai mis l'eau à la bouche plus qu'à goûter !"}
{"text":"Since it was my first time having poutine, I can't speak to how it compares. But Poutineville's biggest plus was their \"build-your-own-poutine\" feature. As someone who keeps mostly veggie but other times pesceterian, I liked being able to build myself a delicious meatless poutine with sautéed onions, black olives, and mushrooms. Good local brews on tap too. This place is hopping so I felt like I was rushed out after I finished my meal, which I why I'm deducting a star."}
{"text":"Love the poutine. It's a huge portion they serve you. I ended up sharing the poutine with my husband. You can pick and choose any toppings you want all for roughly $9 dollars. Of course, there are additional items that costs $1 more. But it's worth it! 

We got the bacon (it was a bit too crunchy) and all I can taste after is the bacon. Wished I would had got the sausages instead! 

The cheese and gravy was just the right amount. I'm not sure how much calories I have consumed, but it was well worth it! 

The space was a bit too tight for my liking. I felt really really cramped in there. There was a party of 8 beside us and that wasn't very pleasant. 

Would love to come back here when I'm visiting Montreal again! Wish Toronto have something like this!"}
{"text":"Ah, okay Poutine, hate to say it given the hype, but I've had better at most fast food joints in Montreal.  I had the regular Poutine with braised beef, but found it to be watery and the cheese curds weren't melted.  Had to ask 2x for the check and it took forever. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Went in for a late bite (3:30am) the waitress was soooo polite and attentive which surprised us, given the fact that around that time is difficult to serve people for obvious reasons.

The poutine is so good that I can compare it with the ones from Montreal. 

You can build your own poutine by selecting the toppings that you want.


Amazing place would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Really great service and awesome
Poutine. You really Can't go wrong with picking all your toppings. I decided to make my own take on a Mexican poutine WHY NOT?  I added black olives, ground beef, guac and sour cream. There's 3 styles of fries you can choose from I took the smashed potatoes because they were different and I like different lol.The waitress Mary S was super friendly and even let us try different type of fries which was pretty cool. I would definitely go back the poutines are huge and delicious a must try."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, the flavors were great but my poutine which was the montrealer had so many burnt fries that the whole thing tasted like it was burnt. The service is fantastic and we came around 4pm so it was empty and it got busy pretty quick. We got the fried mars bar and it was to die for!! My husband had the poutine with the wine sauce and it was good. This place was good, I recommend it for a great Canadian experience. Maybe I was unlucky and got a bad batch but I still had a great time here."}
{"text":"Si vous aimez la poutine, ou voulez goûter à différents types de poutines, cette place est faite pour vous!
Large choix de poutines, porc effiloché, épicée, etc etc..
Vous pouvez faire votre mélange vous même, en choisissant le style de patates (possibilité de les prendre même pilées! c'est à dire en purée), la garniture, la sauce, le fromage!
Alcool disponible et très abordable
Service ok, on était 6 et on a quand meme attendu assez longtemps nos poutines.. D'ailleurs, la 6e personne a attendu encore plus longtemps, on a commencé à manger sans elle.. :(
Mais bon, à part ça, à essayer à tout prix!"}
{"text":"Soliid Poutine - proper portions
Had the house special with braised beef(?) - great flavour - overall cool place"}
{"text":"A nice sit down restaurant to catch the games in over classic and customizable poutine. We ordered the house special consisting of mozzarella cheese curds, braised beef and red wine gravy and crushed potatoes. Crushed potatoes over hand cut fries any day, a better crunch under all that sauce."}
{"text":"We came in for the best poutine in Montreal and we were not disappointed!! I got a pizza poutine and I was very satisfied. The server was attentive and very friendly. Would recommend and would visit again!"}
{"text":"We were in Old Montreal and didn't have a car. Rented 'Bixi' bikes and rode up to Poutineville for lunch. Was great!! Our first poutine and was all we expected. Did not disappoint!! We split a 'regular'/small one and it was just right for lunch for two. Did a very classic/traditional version w/the addition of swiss: smashed potatoes, pulled pork, cheese curds, swiss cheese and classic 'poutine gravy'. Combo was The Bomb. Good service."}
{"text":"Good solid food, cold beer.  Staff was on top of our needs. Had a great time in a PM on Wednesday afternoon, we just came the day before from Australia and this food and drink hit the spot."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, it's one that I go to almost every time I'm in Montreal. Everything is delicious, the service is great and the atmosphere is  cool."}
{"text":"La chic poutine! Portions généreuses, choix intéressant. La Poutine (avec un grand A) sauce au vin rouge est très bien. Le service est courtois. 

Il y a souvent une bonne file d'attente pour les commandes à emporter, prévoyez le coup!"}
{"text":"Ahh poutineville! My favourite spot in Montreal to get a poutine. Most people would argue that La Banquise is better, but I would have to disagree. I find La Banquise burns their fries and they don't have much flavour, as opposed to Poutineville which actually gives you a selection on the type of fries you want with your poutine and doesn't over cook them. I always go with the \"mashed\" fries. It's like they're fried, mashed and then refried. It sounds weird but they are the best fries I have ever had with a poutine. They also have a variety of sauces to choose from along with a good selection of cheeses, vegetables and meat toppings. Want more than 1 type of cheese on your poutine? No problem! You could always tell if a poutine cheese is good due to the fact that it squeaks when chewing it. Luckily, these guys serve up super squeaky cheese so you know it's the real deal. 

What I love about this place is that they're not stingy with their toppings, they will pack it on! I usually have to unbuckle my pants halfway through."}
{"text":"Had better poutine in Toronto. Not a bad place for the price."}
{"text":"I had to try a New-style Poutine just to see what its like. 
My sister and I headed to Poutineville we came on a weekday on an off- hour like 3 pm and were greeted by the waitress, seat where you would like.
  
The Decor was cool brick walls with some pop art. 

The Menus were simple. We ordered the Montrealais its a Smoked Meat Poutine it came out with 2 side salads for us, I thought not only were they delicious salads but she brought us out 2 because we were sharing the Poutine, Nice Plus!

  The Poutine was Mashed Fries, I had to try them cause who hasn't had regular cut or shoestring before??! They were surprisingly different. It was a little bit more like a Baked Potato Poutine. The Gravy and mushrooms were delicious I'm pretty sure it was made from scratch. The Cheese was Swiss and I'm not a fan of Swiss but this cheese on this Poutine made it work perfectly it was heaven.
   It was topped with a fried Pickle wedge. It was nicely seasoned and the pickle inside is a bit warm its a neat sensation if you never had a fried pickle before try it!

   I do agree that there is not a lot of Smoked Meat in it, it could use more, and they could be more generous with the kinds of Fries offered aka Stingy.
 
 Overall a great experience , a great waitress very friendly Bilingual. 

The Poutine was Delicious made a Great meal, and know Poutineville Set the bar High for my next Poutine Experience."}
{"text":"Loved the poutine! Brought me back to my junior high days. There were so many combinations of poutine available. The gravy and the cheese curds were perfect. Had the Mexican and the traditional poutine. The only thing that wasn't that good was the sangria."}
{"text":"I had the food delivered so my review is strictly on the food and not the restaurant/staff experience.

I had high expectations for Poutineville after looking at the menu online.  I like that they have a lot of pre-made choices, a make your own menu and plenty of side items.  You could get really creative if you wanted and there is something for everyone.

I ordered the \"Mexican Poutine\" and given what goes into it I expected a ton of flavor.  Unfortunately the flavor fell flat with my order.  Overall the poutine was okay.  The potatoes, gravy and cheese curds were good, which is good because that is what a poutine is all about anyway.  The guacamole, corn and even jalapeno mixture was bland and the sour cream couldn't save it.   I ended up adding hot sauce to give it more flavor.

I also had an order of the fried pickles which came with a really good spicy mayo for dipping.  Really good to snack on!

As for the price I am indifferent.  The large poutine portion is fair.  However for the type of food it seemed a little expensive (excluding 3rd party delivery fee) and added up quickly for 2 people (poutine/drink x2 and a shared side)

If I am ever around a Poutineville and wanting poutine I'll give it another shot; but this experience was a little bit of a letdown."}
{"text":"If you want poutine, they offer what you want. Lots of choice of how you want your poutine including build your own. Also serves alcohol, service was quick as well."}
{"text":"So for some inexplicable reason this place is closed from 3-5....ridiculous. Of course I got there at 3:15, there's tons of people sitting in the restaurant, but they refuse to seat me. The man was extremely rude about it too. Will not be back and will definitely not be bringing my tour groups here."}
{"text":"Great price and great poutine! How can you go wrong with this stuff? This place is a great place to try when you're in Montreal and haven't tried poutine before!"}
{"text":"If you don't like this place or had a problem with any of the food you should A. Kill yourself B. Question if you are human C. leave Canada and go back to the south.....  It's a good as it gets people. This day I was with 3 others and none of them had a single complaint. It was a mid day affair and they had some gaming tournament going on with all the gross college kids who probably chose not to shower and loved drinking the local brews. I'm not sure if it's the neighborhood, the city ( i do love the 6 ) more than most, or maybe it's just the country? Whatever it is, this is part of it all... My only concern is all the \"I'm with her\" bleeding heart liberals who mentioned they were moving to Canada if Trump got elected, might find out about places like this and ruin it all. I would like to remind all of them starting with Lena Dunham or whatever that broads name was, that you are still here and said you would leave!?!!?!? 

So yeah, either stay in your gross city like Allston or wherever it is that \"I'm with her\" types live, but stay away from the 6, either way I don't care just don't mess with my \"I just met a girl named poutine\" love..............."}
{"text":"Holy....COW this place has great poutine. I think it's the best poutine I've had so far. I suggest making your own poutine than getting the premade ones. Apparently the premades aren't as special. When you make your own you can choose between different kinds of potatoes, cheese, vegetables and sauce. Pretty. Awesome. So I shared my poutine with a friend because I wasn't sure on the size (I regret this because I ended up wanting to finish the whole thing) and we decided on ecrasee potatoes which is like crinkled mashed potato pieces, two cheeses: mozarella and swiss, and two vegetables : olives and mushrooms, as well as a trois poivres sauce. WOW. I had this as a late night snack and man was it a great snack. 

Service was superb too. Very friendly and warm. So that's a bonus point. I suggest coming here to try their poutine. I will come back for more....that;s for sure."}
{"text":"It's a place.

A place with poutine.

Lots of poutine.

Get creative and assemble your own.

Pro-tip: Add gyros & jalapenos to the standard set-up for extra tastiness."}
{"text":"I don't think I've eaten at places good enough or bad enough for reviews until the past few months or year haha but now I have an arsenal of places to write about! 

Gonna start with one of my favourites because why not? Poutineville was a pain in the butt for me to get to because I worked in Mississauga at the time and as a seasoned commuter, I knew I had to literally fly out the door at 330pm to make it to spadina station for the 7pm reservation with some friends. 

Poutineville was oh, so worth it though. There are always people who complain about every choice in life that they had too much to choose from, and so they couldn't make up their minds. Not I. No way. I embrace choices. I like making decisions based on what I know I will enjoy or not enjoy; food decisions make me even happier! 

With the various options available, I knew I would be trying the stuff that I hadn't had in a while, in addition to things I can get easily as well. First off, choose the type of fries. A type for every mood you're feeling is available. I think that right there sealed the deal right off the bat. Then toppings! Things like pogo and red wine reduction stuff? coleslaw and corn and omg there was just everything I wanted. Those topping combinations could've gone on forever! I don't remember all the things I put on, but zucchini, red peppers, green peppers, chhhheeeeeeesssseeeee; I couldn't stop. Then there was the option to double bake it so your cheese could be an amazing ooey gooey masterpiece when you dig into it. Yup. 

The table across from me got the Heart attack. Aptly named, it was massive and disgusting in the best way possible haha. 

All I can say is, the atmosphere there is great, the music is bearable if you don't mind top 40, but the best part is the service. Theyre quick and very friendly and as knowledgeable as they can be, depending on how long they've been working there. 

I have decided to give this place my business whenever I'm downtown and craving the perfect snack containing everything I want in the moment. Hint hint... Maybe you'll like it too!"}
{"text":"This PoutineVille location replaces what used to be Bofinger. It opened this Tuesday Oct 25th to the public.  My boyfriend and I raved about the work they did to turn it around. We always loved the make your own poutine concept from the PoutineVille chains. This location is especially well decorated. The ambiance is cozy and the restaurant is really inviting. The overhead lights are very nice and all the TV's are angled in a way that isn't distracting unlike other locations. If you were there to watch a sports game you would have a good time as well.

They have a really good menu selection; it's not just poutine. I feel like it would be great for a party because they have lots of different options for different tastes. They revamped how the bar section is set-up with a strong focus on taps and a full bar. 

We had a chance to talk to two of the co-owners who are seasoned restaurateurs. They were approachable and talked about this new location with passion and vision. 

We made a poutine with nacho cheese and ground beef. It arrived fast and it was delicious. I loved how even though it came in a plate/bowl thing the sauce reached the bottom. Many times, poutines have sauce only on the top and so when that's done, you only have fries left. 

The service was great, especially for the first night. The staff was super nice.

I would really recommend trying it out even if you've already visited another PoutineVille."}
{"text":"Good Poutine place, you can customize it to your liking and the portions are big. I got one to share and we were both full."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful place. Our waitress was so friendly and helpful. She gave my husband and I lots of tips about what to do in Montreal. She also brought us our potions with the crushed potatoes instead of the regular(the speciality O'Neal that we ordered had the regular fries). The ambience was very nice. 
We tried the Brazilian coffee and the Irish coffee. Both were really good. The Brazilian coffee was a lot stronger (definitely a generous amount of alcohol). 
We got the Firebreather. That came with a spicy sauce, peppers and three 911 chicken wings. The wings were absolutely fantastic. The gravy was really tasty. I loved that they had crushed fries. Absolutely great."}
{"text":"After eagerly waiting for months for this restaurant to open, me and my bf finally got to go tonight. We decided to do the \"all you can eat Poutine on Tuesdays for $15\". The atmosphere is very nice, exposed brick inside, quiet little patio in the back... the food is absolutely delicious. We tried all the choices of Poutine we could and had 2 pitcher of Steam Whistle no complaints these, HOWEVER.... the service was absolutely attrocious. We arrived at 7:30, were seated quickly on the patio in the back by the hostes... then the server (Cecilia) took 5 mins before greating us, and it only got worse from there. She came by only 3 times in the first hour, failed to check on us after the food arrived which took like 30 mins to arrive (were talking about poutine here people). We even spoke to the manager about the service and he kept making excuses instead of recognizing the problem and try to resolve it. Hr came by a coiple times afterwars trying to make up... it was nice of him but too litle too late...To note though, another server (Chris) tried to improve our experience by taking away dirty dishes, filling our glasses and taking an order, even though we were not his table (he was serving other tables on the patio) which made our experience much better (thanks Chris). Because the food was so good, we will give this place another try (not having that Cecilia server again), but if the service doesn't improve...we will most likely not come back. Food =  Service =  Give yourself A LOT of extra time when you go..."}
{"text":"We went here for an early lunch on vacation with our seven year old son. The waitress went out of her way to make sure we had a good time. She even brought me a note that asked if she could give him a popsicle after lunch, thereby avoiding his disappointment if I had said no. The food was good but the service was wonderful!"}
{"text":"So today I was in the mood for some Poutine and red wine (don't knock it till you try it!). 

Poutineville in the Annex gave me exactly what I was looking for. I had the \"Poutinville Special\" - which was AMAZING! It was Poutine composed of crushed fries (house special) with their signature red wine gravy (not too salty - just right), gooey cheese curds and mozzarella, along with braised beef that's been cooked for 12 hours ... And you can tell because it melts in your mouth. And seriously .. Try it with a full bodied glass of Cabernet Sauvignon .. It's the perfect combo! 

Great service at Poutinville (thanks Chris) .. They even allow you to build your own Poutine .. Definitely gonna check this place out again."}
{"text":"A Montréal il y a deux places pour la poutine, \"La Banquise\" et POUTINEVILLE.

J'aime vraiment leur concept de la poutine sur mesure, en gros on a une feuille avec les ingrédients et on coche ce qu'on veut dedans (les prix sont indiqués juste à coté) . Par contre il faut faire attention car ça monte vite au niveau du prix.

J'ai testé à la patate douce, écrasé et normal, les frites sont géniales. La garniture pareil surtout quand vous vous faites un spécial qui pique beaucoup *-* c'est bon.

Jamais déçu, je conseil vraiment d'y allez faire un tour =)."}
{"text":"I want to say at the top: ALL OF THEIR SAUCES *EXCEPT* WINE are GLUTEN-FREE. 
(It made made me hesitate...) 
So now that I've gotten that out of the way:
This was my first Poutine.
I'm now a superfan. 
Poutine Plus Moderne: build your own with what's on the list OR get pre-designed if you are feeling indecisive. Terrific wine with generous pours. Service with humor and wit in French, English or Frenglish. 

It's kind of pricey, I guess, but the food is plenty for a couple of meals. If you get a large, it's good for lunches most of the week. Honestly, the quality is so good, I didn't balk at it. I can't wait to go back.

Why aren't you there yet?"}
{"text":"Great spot in Montreal to grab a quality poutine! I ordered a traditional poutine with their house special fries topped with hot dogs and my boyfriend ordered the house speciality, the braised beef with red wine sauce poutine - both were amazing. The fries were crispy and the gravy and cheese both really tasty without being overly salty. Service was friendly and quick - beware of long line ups though. We came around 6:30pm and were seated right away...only to look out to a line up out the door not long after we were seated. Would definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"Had never tried poutine, but a hotel employee recommended this place, so some friends and I gave it a try last night. I had the Rocky, which was Philly cheesesteak, nacho cheese, and onions. It was good, but not life-changing, but the service was good and the beers were cheap. If I had to do it over again, I might stick with the classic poutine."}
{"text":"First time having pouting so nothing to compare it too. It as really good!  We ordered the sirloin and the montrealer. Both were really good. Even the standard is a decent portion. Really good and I will go back next time I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"Visited this summer. Best poutine in Ontario that I've had. Makes sense since Poutineville is from Quebec. They not only have normal poutine made with regular fries, but these \"hand crushed mashed fried potato\" style fries that are incredible.

Recommend: house special

Beats Poutinis in my view."}
{"text":"Delicious poutine!! You can customize your own or order from their standard menu. Ordered a house salad and a large poutine with house-made potatoes and cheese curds for 2 people. Proportions are just right in my opinion - not too filling and doesn't leave you hungry for more (in a good way). There are multiple locations throughout Quebec. This one in Montreal has a casual and comfortable setting. Staff took a while to seat us and take our order, but very friendly!"}
{"text":"So I spontaneously wound up here with a few guys right after playing ultimate frisbee at a nearby park in subzero temperatures, and wanted some filling comfort food with beer. We got just what we wished for! This place has beer in pitchers and among many poutine dishes there was one dish called Criss de Cardiaque, which is basically 15 lbs of poutine. You get to chose the type of fries for the poutine, and we went for the home fries,  which turned out to be a kind of mashed potato fries with lots of cheese and gravy and extra toppings like onion, bacon, sausage, mushrooms, green pepers, and maybe a few things I forgot to mention. Lots of goodness for just 7 people, but sure enough we finished it all and got some cheese and strawberry cake too!  Brilliant place! The service was fine, and we had fun!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I stopped by for the house special poutine!  Their hand crushed potatoes were unique and had a lot of crispy surface area.  Their combination cheese curds and mozzarella cheese tasted nice and fresh and was topped with a healthy portion of tender beef with sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and hope to try more from their menu!"}
{"text":"Poutineville! We used to have one in Toronto but not sure what happened to it :(. Anyways, I agree that their Montreal branches are even better in taste.

I ordered the smoked meat poutine with all four cheeses and it was heavenly. Always get the house crushed potatos, they are the absolute best creation ever. Also tried their braised beef before and it was also too good. Chewy curds, drizzled with layers of gravy (I like my poutines heavy on the gravy), and no complaints on the smoked meat. I dont think I can ever try their normal fries after having their crushed potatos.

Staff was courteous and even pointed us to our next stop."}
{"text":"I stopped in shortly after they opened with high expectations. A bar that focuses on poutine? It's like a dream come true or so I thought.

The concept is great. You can pick a pre-planned poutine or you can build your own. Mostly craft beers on the menu.

This place disappointed on every level. The poutine was average at best and I certainly expected something a little more sophisticated than New York Fries grade poutine but at a higher price.

The service was painfully slow. Our waiter came by several times to ask if everything was OK but when you wait 45 minutes for food, it only serves as a painful reminder that they are slow. It wasn't super busy and I'm really not sure how poutine, even custom-topped, could take more than a few minutes to assemble.

There's also no clear place to park. There is little to no on-street parking but there are spaces in an alley next to the restaurant/bar that may or may not be for use by their patrons. I hate having to park somewhere when I have this sinking feeling of returning to a missing car."}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night. Found the place is a bit quiet compared to the other places in the area. We were sat in the patio in the back which I found nice and quiet and away from the chaos of the street. This place allows you to make your own poutine where you can choose just about everything from the type of fries, cheese, gravy, and everything in between. If that doesn't really appeal to you, they offer different variations where you don't have to pick and choose your items.

Overall I enjoyed the food and atmosphere of the place. It's not something that blew my mind but I would definitely recommend it and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Nice food, great serice. I recommend everyone to try their signature crushed potatoes! It's devilishly good! I also tried the sweet potatoes but they are too soft, not crunchy at all.. sauces are great, their gravy is delicious. Gonna come back again for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Je ne suis pas un fan de la poutine mais en accompagnant des visiteurs californiens qui n'y avaient jamais goûter, je me suis forcéun peu. Et malgré mon manque d'enthousiasme pour la poutine, je dois avouer que j'ai bien aimé. L'ambiance est conviviale, le service est efficace et j'ai préféré leur poutine (grâce à la sauce) à celle de La Banquise (ou du reste on aurait dû faire la file)."}
{"text":"Je remercie mon amie lilia qui m'a fait découvrir cet endroit , g adore l'ambiance l'accueil et surtout la Poutine , j'y reviendrais dès mon retour à Montréal"}
{"text":"Great fun place. Good service friendly and helpful. Been there twice yummy poutines of course but the ribs and burgers were juicy yummy as well. Do yourself a favor and always say yes to the coleslaw it is the best I've had anywhere and I don't usually like coleslaw."}
{"text":"Le service étais lent (15 minutes avant d'avoir un simple verre d'eau). Nous n'avons pas reçus de menu, mais une simple feuille en papier pour \"customize\" notre poutine. (À croire qu'il y a juste ça qu'ils servent) enfin bref, a la fin dans notre poutine il y avais des ingrédients que nous n'avons jamais demander et des ingrédients en trop."}
{"text":"Poutine rookie from Tennessee. Read ya'll s reviews and decided to try it. The staff was great making me feel right at home. They explained the process and the daily specials. 
I tried the home fries, cheese curds, tomato, onion, mushrooms and slow cooked roast. Wow was it good. Glad I got the smaller size. That and a diet coke in a bottle was still at 20$ CA. 
Great warm meal on a cold Montreal night and great staff to boot."}
{"text":"The poutine was exactly what you'd hope!  But even better is the amazing amount of ways you cane make your own. Sandwiches and burgers were awesome too! Come to the USA!"}
{"text":"The second we got to Montreal we knew the first thing we needed to do was eat poutine. Poutineville turned out to be the perfect choice for our first one of the trip.

This place gives you the option of ordering one of several specialty poutines on the menu or building your own with any combination of potatoes, meats, cheeses, vegetables, and sauces. I chose the latter and took the standard poutine (french fries, gravy, cheese curds) and mixed it up a bit by ordering their house specialty crushed potatoes in place of fries, and adding onions and montreal smoked meat. The result was AMAZING. 

While the service was a little lacking and the inside of the restaurant a little too hot it was definitely worth it to get my hands on this excellent poutine. I highly recommend to anyone looking to sample this signature French Canadian dish!"}
{"text":"Likes: poutine, service
Dislikes : location

Food:
The poutine here has great portions! I had the house special, with some braised beef on top of the original poutine, and it was amazing. I am so glad that we went to this one. The poutine was very authentic!

Service:
The server we had spoke perfect English and French, so we really appreciated his flexibility. The food came out fast, with everything we needed. 

Location:
We were taking transit throughout our trip and found this place to be out of the way from downtown Montreal. Thus, it wasn't as accessible after hanging out at the touristy spots and took awhile to get here. Boo.

Verdict:
Great place. I see why a lot of Québécois people recommend this restaurant as the place to be for poutine. I suggest that people check this out!"}
{"text":"All these years of ordering poutine. Tried MY FIRST REAL POUTINE here! Wow! Onions, peppers, smoked meat, cheese - lots of cheese. Yum! They have a build your own poutine menu where you get several choices of sauce, meat, cheese, and vegetables. You can get everything from a Pogo corndog to fried onions on your poutine.

The service was excellent - the owner really friendly despite my lack of french; he was quite patient and understanding."}
{"text":"Fried pickles are my favorite there. The batter is crispy and flavorful (could use a pinch more salt) but I hate it when you bite into it, the whole pickle comes out. That's how you determine a good fried pickle and onion ring (onion and pickle stays in place when bitten). The burgers are nothing special. I like the idea you can create your own poutine but it gets a little pricy for the poutine if you put too much stuff on it. I enjoy the crushed potatoes because its different from what other poutine places have to offer. Their choices in poutine sauces taste similar. The sauce is the most important part of the poutine and I feel like the sauces are lacking. The volcano one tastes like the original with pepper flakes. But overall, it's okay. Not my favorite poutine place and rarely come here."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant de Poutine approuvé par 4 français. La qualité est au rendez vous et le prix est tout à fait acceptable face à la qualité du produit offert. De plus, le fait de pouvoir manger sur place ou à emporter est vraiment pratique, surtout lorsqu'on a pas finit notre repas et qu'on veut récupérer le repas en tant que doggy bag.
Enfin l'ambiance dans le restaurant est agréable, le serveur est très gentil et le décor est tout à fait appréciable !"}
{"text":"Alright people... For those of you unfamiliar with poutine this place is a spectacular arena to get educated on the subject. 
French Canadians have taken fries to the next level... They dump a ridiculous amount of unrelated food on top of a heaping pile of fries. And voila! Poutine!!!
The classic is what peeps in the north east USA would refer to as Disco Fries... Cheese Curds and gravy on fries.
On this visit I had \"The Montrealer\" which is what Canadians call smoked meat, which is essentially pastrami, with Swiss cheese mushrooms and gravy, with a fried pickle. Like a Ruben sandwich all poutine'd up. 
I'd recommend getting the regular portion.. The large size may cause your arteries some trouble."}
{"text":"I'm somewhat of a poutine amateur but this poutine was effing outstanding. The braised beef house special in wine sauce was stupendous. I'm glad I walked in sub-zero temperatures to get there. Sweet French Jesus, it was delicious."}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal and not eating poutine is like visiting NYC and not enjoying a slice of pizza.  Or going to Philadelphia and not getting a Philly cheesesteak.  Or going to Denver and not seeking out a Denver omelette.  Okay, the last one is a stretch, no one makes it a point to eat a boring omelette while in Denver (and it's not even really a thing in Denver anyway).

The only problem is which poutinerie to choose!  Luckily (or not?), our options were a bit narrowed as we were looking for a vegetarian gravy.

Fortunately, Poutineville was close to our Inn as well as on the way home from our day of wandering around the city.  The interior was nicer and livelier than I expected.  Judging by the website and the sushi style menu for ordering poutine, I expected Poutineville to be a fast casual kind of joint but it was full service and they had beer.

You can order a set dish or order off the sushi style check off menu (with several options for fries, sauce, cheese, meats, and veggies).  Our friendly server even put Xs through anything containing meat to aid in our dining decision.  Not wanting to stray too far from the classic (you know, so I could go home and bitch about how we can't get poutine as authentic or life changing as I enjoyed in Montreal) I opted for the house potatoes (smashed and fried), traditional gravy (in Montreal they call it barbecue sauce!), traditional cheese curds, and onions and mushrooms (adding my own flair).

When our server brought out our selections, it was like Christmas. \"Poutine for Carly!  And poutine for David!\" she said as she sat our plates in front of us.

We then proceeded to eat like we were in prison, hardly slowing down to take a breath.    \"How is this not, like, a thing at home?\" Dave asks me as he begins polishing off the leftovers on my plate.  \"If there were a food truck with this, people would LOSE THEIR MINDS.\"  Poutineville doesn't skimp on the salty, thin, brown gravy and the smashed and fried house potatoes managed to maintain their crispiness to the end.  So good.

Unfortunately, probably not so good for you and we felt the gut bomb later on.  We had lofty hopes to eat poutine twice on our trip but only made it once (probably a good thing).

Still, when in Montreal, a must eat."}
{"text":"Cool little place, amazing food, got the braised beef poutine. Staff was friendly, it was slow and raining outside so she was around whenever I needed something. All around nice place."}
{"text":"Super service et excellentes poutines ! 
Lors du passage à Montréal d'un couple d'amis américains, je me décide à leur fait goûter une spécialité bien québecoise. Quel succès ! 

Chez Poutineville, on customize sont plat: on choisit le type de pommes de terres (les maisons sont délicieuses), la sauce, les fromages, les viandes et les légumes. On peut l'avoir gratinée...
En tout cas, mieux vaut arriver avec une grosse faim car les portions sont généreuses. 
Le restaurant propose aussi des poutines-spécialités avec des recettes déjà bien établies pour les moins imaginatifs ou aventureux, ainsi que plusieurs recettes classiques type burgers ou salade ceasar.

Le staff était également aux petits soins et nous a très bien conseillé ! 

Bref, un super endroit que je vous recommande vivement lorsque vous en quête d'une soirée bien québécoise :)"}
{"text":"YES! I'm so glad Poutineville finally made it's way to Toronto! My experience in Toronto was MUCH better than when I went to Montreal.. it's probably because in Montreal  I tried to be all healthy and ordered sweet potato fries and they were mushy and underwhelming. Who was I trying to kid? If I'm ordering a poutine, I might as well go all the way and have real fries.. ANYWAY, here  I got a custom poutine with gravy, mushrooms, corn and vegan cheese. The fries were perfectly crisp, and piping hot, just the way I like em. I don't know why I thought corn in poutine would be a good idea, but it really didn't add much to it. They used Daiya vegan cheese which kinda clumped up when it cooled which I wasn't a big fan of. I'm definitely just going to skip the cheese all together next time.. But the mushrooms and the gravy were ON POINT. Did you know that their original poutine gravy is vegan? Yeah, amazing right?! The gravy was really rich in flavour and had the perfect consistency; not too runny, not too thick. 

It's still hard for me to justify paying $15 for potatoes and gravy, but it seems like all foods are costing an arm and a leg in downtown Toronto these days.. 

This spot is also VERY spacious. I was so shocked when I walked in! It's a great place to chill, grab a drink, watch the game, and enjoy some kickass poutine :)"}
{"text":"Even though the portions are sizeable, the prices are still a little steep for poutine. The gravy is flavourful, but the fries just aren't that great. The fries were just a little soggy and didn't have much of a crunch, and I LIVE for that crispy outer layer of a french fry. I tried the vegan cheese and it was much better than I expected! It melted uniformly and tasted very much like real cheese. If you're one to love customizing your meals, this will be perfect for you because you can create your own poutine, choosing the type of fries, sauces, cheese, and additional toppings. Overall the flavour was great- if only the fries were crispier, Poutineville would've knocked it out of the park."}
{"text":"I'd like to say I use to love going to this place. I'd go with friends every friday night almost. The main reason being that a couple of waiters there were extremely friendly and attentive. Now the place sucks because those people are no longer working there. Kills the atmosphere in my opinion. Never going back."}
{"text":"So good. So so so so good. So many options and the ingredients are spot on. The staff was wonderful and very informative and enthusiastic! The restaurant's interior was very chic- probably the fanciest poutine experience I've had! Their cocktails and such are very expensive though- that's the only thing keeping this from being five full stars."}
{"text":"I will caveat this by first saying that I do not enjoy poutine -- at all.  With that said, I think Poutineville was particularly underwhelming.  The fries were soggy, and braised beef (while plentiful) was extremely salty.  Even the poutine-lovers in my group did not enjoy this meal.

Worst of all, the chicken wing appetizer came out severely undercooked.  Not just a little undercooked... rather, the center of the drumettes were cold and completely raw."}
{"text":"Costa- the owner on Ontario St- is the George Clooney of Poutine!   Such a passion for the pout this guys has.  His Poutine powers will solve any Poutine problems you have.  Georgia is the Poutine goddess always there with a smile and a good pout to boot!   Create your own Poutine dream come true- it might cost a few bucks more than La Bunkquise but it's WAYYYY better and the staff is not cranked on meth curd.   Poutineville is the romantic comedy of Poutine, the action adventure of Poutine!  Pout some deep fried drama into your life- go to Poutineville - and try the breaded pickles~"}
{"text":"Was a cool place. Fries could be better. Fresh ingredients. Ability to make your own unique poutine. I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I love this place. You can customize your poutine and they have the widest choice of toppings I know of. Good place for groups."}
{"text":"We had the Poutineville (house special) and the Farmer's Delight. Both were very good. The house special was more flavorful than the farmer's delight. We had the regular size which were nice sized portions. You can share one if you're not that hungry. Overall very yummy and great relaxed vibe. Good service also."}
{"text":"OMG it so  yummy and gooey I was full for the next 2 days.

Make sure you choose the option \"crushed potato\" basically it's done by hand but it ensures the fries are kept crisp even under layers of gravy. 

Well worth the effort to Bus there.

I had Pogo+bacon+ smoke meat + zucchini +goat cheese+milk curds+gravy.   

We got there around 2:30 PM so no crowds."}
{"text":"Just love this place the food and service is always good. This is my 5th time going there and it has never disappointed me."}
{"text":"La meilleure Poutine de l'île. Le concept de faire sa propre poutine est excellent! Un peu cher, mais toujours bon. C'est à essayer!"}
{"text":"Located in what seems to be a quieter part of town, we were greeted warmly and shown right to a table.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive.

Along with standard fries, they offer their poutine with crispy smashed potatoes which were crispier than the fries and delicious.  We enjoyed the House special which included the smashed potatoes, cheese curds and mozzarella, braised beef and red wine gravy; it was  decadent and tasty.  The Hat Trick included fries with bacon, hot dogs, minced beef, cheese curds and poutine gravy.  It was also good, although I wish the bacon had been crispy as it would have added a nice texture contrast to the dish.  

The regular size is definitely enough for 1 person, as poutine is quite a hearty dish. Good choice for poutine whether you choose one of their concoctions or make your own."}
{"text":"Ohhh this place has changed since I came here about 1-2 years ago.  The service was lacklustre and the food has changed for the worse.  I came here for the coveted mashed up fries with pogo as the prime topping for Poutine. Instead, I got a measly 1 pogo stick cut up in five pieces with smoked meat that seemed like it was just frozen and microwaved.  I don't know what happened to this joint especially since I've raved about it for years to those visiting Montreal.  It wasn't busy and the service was whatever - not once did our waitress come by to see if things were alright nor were water filled once.  To put a rotten cherry on top (demanded tip) demanding tip for just bringing food to my table is ridiculous.

Sorry yelpers; we may need to return to la banquise or just stick to la belle province.

This place is now in my AVOID list."}
{"text":"I visited Montréal on a weekend getaway a few months ago.  I enjoyed the sightseeing (it's an absolutely awesome city to just wander around in during the day and night), but the highlight of my trip was the poutine at this place.

I've had poutine several times before (in both Toronto and Vancouver), but French Canadians do it best.  I had the large poutine with bacon, chicken, tomato, smoked meat, corn, and cheese curds.  The portions are generous, cheese is so fresh, and gravy is delicious.  I washed it all down with a St. Ambroise Cream Ale, which was one of the smoothest beers that's ever graced my taste buds (it's a shame they don't ship it to the States).  

Just a great experience overall.  I'll be returning the next time I visit Montréal."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for business for just a few days and am so glad I stopped here. I liked the build your own option. The portions we're huge, tasty and the service quick as well as extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Pretty good but it all depends on your creations! Fun times and I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"First time having poutine and it was delicious! We had the Philly poutine which I guess is the most American one, but we really enjoyed it. A petit was big enough for my wife and I to share. The server was amazing as well, super friendly!"}
{"text":"very tasty food here! It is really easy to go overboard with the make-your-own poutine menu. I definitely overindulged! Make sure that you are really hungry when you visit, you will be stuffed! 

I didn't have a problem because I am an old person and eat dinner super early but there was a wicked long line out the door after I got there. I do believe that they take reservations"}
{"text":"They've got a lot of options for poutine, pre-set and build your own. Proportions are great - you'll have enough to take home some too! I came here because my american brother in law wanted poutine. Although there are restaurants with GOOD poutine as one of their dishes, this place allowed us to really sink our teeth into the world of poutine. Solid place."}
{"text":"Le concept est simple; tu crées ta poutine selon ton envie du moment. Ils ont des sauces originales, tout plein de fromages (vous avez déjà mis du brie dans votre poutine? Un must!), un petit choix de patates (on s'entend qu'à ce niveau là c'est dur d'aller plus loin que patates normales ou patates douces, mas ils ont réussi à trouver des petites twists le fun du genre patates écrasées), des viandes et plein de légumes. Ils ont aussi d'autres classiques du fast food et des desserts (qui ont l'air décadents) mais quand tu vas au Poutineville, de un c'est pour manger de la poutine, pas un burger ou une salade (bel effort, mais personne va croire quelqu'un qui dit avoir été au Poutineville pour manger santé), et de deux je vois pas comment tu peux avoir faim pour un dessert après. Mais peut-être que je me trompe et que ces plats là valent la peine, faudrait que j'essaie... mais je pense pas que je serais capable de résister à une bonne poutine. Petite selection de bières sympa, ça ferme tard; Mention spéciale à leur frites de patates douces, elles me hantent encore depuis ma dernière visite. Dans le genre, c'est parfait."}
{"text":"Semi overrated.... friends ordered large platters around $15. A $20 order and would give you left overs for tomorrow. Didnt seem like they had as many toping offers as rumour has it. First time for me there so ordered $11 sampler.. should have been $5 it was small and just plane poutine. The cheese wasnt even melted as the gravy wasnt hot enough. Their crushed fries are the good and sweet potatoes. Small glasses of water with super slow and unorganized waiters.ambience was basic and blah. Something to try once and order the full big meal and decide yourself if its worth it. Im not going back."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. Tried the namesake, the steak, and the mushroom baked one, all very good. Yes we ate all 3 but we were hungry. The portions are big so bring your appetite. The waiter we had was awesome didn't catch his name but was very helpful with suggestions. Best poutine I've had in Canada."}
{"text":"Very good service, good food.
Really recommended place especially for lunch.
Wide selection of foods too.
But it is a bit noise because it on the streets but otherwise excellent."}
{"text":"The BF and I ended up here after a night of karaoke and drinking. A LOT of soju. Needless to say, we needed some greasy sustenance.

We ordered fried pickles and the classic poutine with smashed potatoes.

The fried pickles were awesomely crispy and served with a tasty aioli. As for the poutine, I really liked the copious amounts of cheese, crispy potatoes, and yummy gravy. YUM!

Our server was awesome and suggested a great $5 drink special for me to try. I wish I could remember the name but it was a grapefruit vodka concoction which was delish.

Will return sober to re-evaluate but I enjoyed my time here!!"}
{"text":"Poutineville is hands-down my favourite poutine place in Montreal! However, make sure you are ordering POUTINE and not something else (you wouldn't go eat vegetables at an bbq restaurant). 

This being said, I highly recommend their build your own poutine option and even more highly recommend their smashed potatoes - they are so crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, even when covered with gravy. Also, make sure you stick with the cheese curds and do not change it to any other kinds of cheeses (poutine isn't poutine without the curds).

I usually build mine with smashed potatoes, regular gravy and cheese and top up with two vegetables and one protein (I find hot-dog sausages particularly good in poutine - they are normal processed hotdog sausages). Oh and I always make sure to add onions!"}
{"text":"WOW NO WORDS!!! This place was great!!!! People that worked here were super helpful and friendly. 
We started off with a kids meal- grilled cheese and fries ($3.75- ONLY) and they were very generous with portion. My kid loves it. We also had their beers- SOOOOO FRESH and crisp. Awesomeness. 
Then we ordered POUTINE of course. I got regular fries with cheese curds and gravy topped with guac. It was very good. Next time id skip the guac. 

Hubby got chopped fries with cheese curds and gravy topped with hot dog. He said very good. I don't eat pork. This was a great meal haha. Fries. Yum. 

Photo below!!! That's my mouth ha!"}
{"text":"La poutine y est bonne, mais pas extraordinaire. On peut créer sa poutine sur mesure, ce que je ne recommande pas particulièrement. Quand on a une grosse envie de poutine, c'est l'fun d'en manger une bonne, et non pas d'expérimenter. En tout cas moi j'ai été déçue par la mienne!

Ce que je recommande, toutefois : les patates écrasées au lieu des frites, c'est plus croquant et c'est vraiment vraiment bon! 

Attendez-vous à rouler en sortant de là, mais ça on s'y attend en allant manger une bonne pout'!"}
{"text":"First time at Poutineville and went to the Rue Ontario East location. WOW! Really cool atmosphere, had a bar vibe but appropriate for my young teenagers. Staff were attentive, friendly and although busy, took the time to answer questions without being rushed. OK the poutine. Choices were amazing and stayed true to poutine. Choices of how you want your fries cut, different kinds of cheese,  meat, gravy etc. Portions are generous, and you can even choose regular or large topping servings whether you order a regular or large poutine. I had a regular size poutine with julienne cut fries, extra cheese curds, bacon and gravy plus a regular Cole slaw on the side. I could only finish half. FYI the coleslaw is an unknown treat! We would definitely go again, and are waiting for when they come to Toronto!"}
{"text":"My first time visiting Montreal and I just had to try poutine. I decided to order the \"Montrealer\". I added my own twist by substituting the home fries with hand crushed potatoes (for extra crunch!), the swiss with brie, and got the poutine gravy on the side. My boyfriend decided to order the \"Hat Trick\". Our waiter was extremely helpful and accommodating. However, the service was rather slow, it was quite hard to get the wait staff's attention.

While I thoroughly enjoyed my order, my boyfriend not so much, he said his plate was too salty. I would definitely recommend getting the poutine gravy on the side so that you can control how saturated and salty you want your potatoes. I would also recommend sharing since its quite a lot of potatoes."}
{"text":"came here with a friend on a very non-busy Saturday afternoon. it took HALF AN HOUR to get our food after we ordered. ridiculous."}
{"text":"C'est ma deuxième visite au Poutineville Beaubien + une visite à celui sur Ontario. L'intérieur est sur deux étages. J'adore le concept de créer sa poutine personnalisée en variant patates, sauces, fromages et accompagnements. Il faut faire attention aux extras afin de ne pas faire monter la facture! Les patates écrasées maison sont excellentes et ils ont des sauces qui sont végétariennes et sans gluten. Il y a aussi certains mélanges préétablis qui sont plus économiques que lorsque commandés à la carte. Malgré que la nourriture soit excellente, le service était moyen lors d'un dimanche soir moyennement achalandé. Le restaurant est ouvert assez tard, donc c'est une bonne idée pour une fringale de fin de soirée. Je ne crois pas que ce soit le meilleur endroit pour faire découvrir la poutine à quelqu'un qui n'est pas familier mais, pour les habitués, ça permet vraiment de faire changement."}
{"text":"Great poutine.  I took my wife here because she loves poutine and she wanted to have the authentic Quebec version. I was not a fan of poutine until this place!  Great atmosphere, great food, decent price and the service was awesome. We'll be coming here next time we're in the Montreal area and visiting the Toronto location too.

Go for the braised beef!!!"}
{"text":"The poutine was ok not the best though, I found the sauce to be boring and the service was rude, it seemed that the servers had more important things to do like talk about their personal lives rather than take care of the costumers."}
{"text":"If you want real deal poutine, this is your spot.  The menu lists poutine creations you can just order straight from like at a pizza restaurant, or like a pizza restaurant, you can create your own toppings for your poutine.  They also have an all-you-can-eat poutine night on Tuesdays with certain poutine varieties.  We really like the poutine and in fact came back three times.  Get a mix with the crispy fries for sure.  The \"Poutineville\" is excellent.  Someone said they didn't like the red wine gravy here but I have no idea how they could say that because that sauce is rich and terrific.  The place is a little bit of a dive (but definitely not dirty or grungy), but more in a locals way, and it seems like it would be a real college student favorite.  They have shots, all kinds of cocktails (but college type cocktails, not artisan mixed, you know what I mean), but you can also get an ok glass of wine or beer or sodas.  They play current music too so it has that young vibe but older people were just as welcome and at home here.  Very casual, very local, good efficient service.  They do take out also.  We are fans!"}
{"text":"I had such a good time here. I came in the early evening on a Saturday and was greeted promptly. My waitress was so kind, bringing over water and even continuing to bring over water after my meal was done and I was just sitting chatting with a friend. I ordered the classic poutine and WOW. This dish is so well balanced . The crispness of the potatoes with that soft and tender meat! The waitress told me they slow cook for a day or so and I totally believe it. Everything about this place was divine. I wish I had time to come back on my trip but I will definitely be coming back here the next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Turned my wife who never liked poutine into a believer.  Thank you Poutineville."}
{"text":"Wow! 
J'aime le concept. J'aime les choix des poutines suggéré au menu. 
Tout le monde y trouve sa poutine (ses sorte de frites, sa sauce, etc.) 
Service: un peu long, mais rien de dramatique
Prix: acceptable."}
{"text":"Classique poutineville. Vraiment la meilleure poutine du Québec sans hésiter. On mange bien. Je regrette le choix des bières qui pourraient provenir de microbrasseries. Rajouter des ingrédients rends la poutine un peu cher, mais ça vaut la peine."}
{"text":"Meilleure Poutine du monde. Super service"}
{"text":"Way to dress up an otherwise pedestrian dish.  Sure, poutine is a Canadian cultural classic, but when I grew up, french fries with gravy was my high school lunch meal--sure, without cheese curds mixed in but even with the curds, it is nothing more than simple.  But Poutineville uses this \"base\" as a platform for a real meal!

I was surprised to see an offering for All You Can Eat.  Poutine?  AYCE?  Why?  After looking at the $15 poutine meals, I figured for my first time that a sampling was in order, hence the AYCE for the same $15.  There are 5 choices 1) Classic (why bother), 2) Braised beef, 3) Smoked Meat, 4) Rocky (Philly steak with nacho cheese and cartelized onions), and the smoking' hot variation whose name I can't recall.

You start by ordering two bowls, and then follow up one at a time.  I started with the 2 and the 4.  The Braised beef was immediately one of my faves, and the Rocky was equally enjoyable, but the con quesa cheese made it a bit unusual and delivered a bit of heat to the throat.

My follow-up was the 3, which made sense to have Montreal Smoked meat on a Quebec style poutine.  Of course I skipped the carb loading of the 1, and the hellfire of the 5.  

I only got through 3 dishes. AYCE involving french fries takes you to overkill way too fast.  Too many carbs, but a bit more of the rich gravy would have prompted me to finish the last of the fries.  This is more difficult than AYCE sushi, since you don't feel a sense of accomplishment with a measly 3 bowls.  But I left enjoyably stuffed, and pleased at the variety I had a chance to sample.

I can't eat this every week, or even every month without it ruining my svelte physique.  But I will be back!"}
{"text":"You know... I put off going here entirely too long. The name alone should have spoken to my romantic side years ago. 

I tried 2 different poutines that were very different from one another. 2 thumbs up! I'll be returning next time I find myself in a deep depression and in the need of a comforting fat induced coma. Sure they have vegetarian burgers and a warm goat cheese salad, but what for?"}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Montreal, I ate virtually nothing but poutine for four days!  Poutineville was by far my favorite (I went THREE times!).  I usually went for a late lunch around 2PM and was seated promptly each time.  The wait staff were always friendly and courteous.  When ordering, you fill out a card with dozens of options for types of potato, chesse, sauces, vegetables, and meats.  With the multitude of choices you could probably eat there every day of the year and not have the same poutine twice.  My favorite was their \"911\" gravy (which wasn't too hot) with pulled pork.  You have the option of ordering \"regular\" size or \"large.\"  I got the regular, and the portion size was HUGE!.  I'm sure a large could be easily split by two people.  I did find a lot of other great poutine places in Montreal, but Poutineville was by far my favorite!"}
{"text":"Amazing poutine!  Tons of different options. Waiter, maybe owner, very friendly and helpful.  More customers speaking French than English in restaurant. Great experience after walking around Montreal and up Mount Royal for 10 hrs."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday with some friends for lunch. Parking was fairly easy. It was cozy and the waiter was friendly and helpful. 

I had the Zeus gyro poutine . The gyro was delicious. The crushed potato was my favorite. Packed with flavor. I would see how poutine would be a Canadian favorite. It warms the belly on a cold night. My only concern or negative comment was the fact that part of my dish was cold. :( It was as if some potatoes were cold and some were room temperature. super upset about that. 

Hope they fix it. Thanks!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is that you can make your own poutine!  This includes having sweet potato fries base as an option.  This was crucial for me and I came out of my way to eat here for that reason since I can't eat regular potatoes (because they are nightshades, but sweet potatoes are not nightshades). 

You can select as many or as few ingredients as you want.  Definitely can be dangerous if you go overboard.  

I can't say this was the best poutine I've had, but I'm grading it on a curve because of the sweet potato option.  The portions are pretty large.  Service was great."}
{"text":"We were looking for a delicious poutine experience for our first time in Montreal and this place delivered! Great food, great atmosphere and very friendly/helpful waitstaff! We thoroughly enjoyed our time here!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few places that were open late on the national holiday. Loved the build your own poutine option. We had the house cut poutine with gravy and bacon. Service was fast and they gave alot of bacon"}
{"text":"Best poutine ever! I had no idea they had these types of places! Highly recommend even for people that don't like poutine! Friendly fast service, huge portions, cold beer! Need I say more??? So damn good!! Reasonably priced too!!"}
{"text":"Ok so this place is legit, for classic poutine they do a pretty good job I must say. 

We tried one of their signature poutine a called the Montrealer it wasn't our fav, but the classic with \"smashed\" potatoes (house specialty) was perfection! Perfectly crisp, oozing with curds and lots of gravy... Which is vegetarian might I add! Also they have VEGAN options too! Something for everyone here. 

Every Tuesday its all you can eat poutine for 15 bucks and every Saturday you can get a burger with a mini poutine for 10 bucks! Gotta say those are some great deals if you ask me. 

My one issue is it was a little chilly inside and no fault of the owners they had a painting \"class\" occupying the back and it was a tad noisy. Otherwise an overall great experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot in Montreal - casual and fun with great food!

I had the \"Rocky\", which is a poutine with \"Philly\"-style steak, grilled onions and nacho cheese - it was savory and so good.  I also had a Poutineville Deli sandwich, which has smoked meat, swiss cheese and cole slaw...it was rich and delicious as well.  I was really impressed by the food here - so decadent and flavorful.

I will definitely return the next time I'm in Montreal...one of the best food experiences!"}
{"text":"I dream about this poutine from time to time. I visited Montreal with my husband back in June of this year. Poutineville was one of the last restaurants we visited and I regret not finding out about it sooner. THE POUTINE WAS AMAZING. I loved the cute, build-your-own menu. I will definitely return to this location if I visit Montreal again."}
{"text":"I really wish the States had something like this, because poutine is such a great dish to eat when you're intoxicated (because of the starch). I customized mine to have steak and opt for chopped potatoes rather than fries, and I ordered swiss cheese, gravy, and onions to go with it. They are very large-portioned, so prepare yourself. I think customizing was better in my opinion because the pre-made poutine on the menu seemed a bit too much for me and was probably slightly pricier. I liked how the customization sheet included which toppings were free and which were costly too, which helped me in calculating on my budget for this trip! My favorite part about the poutine was how much the steak and onions were covered in their special gravy sauce! Such a messy dish, but I think this is my new guilty pleasure!

The service was pretty good given how crowded the place was, but the only thing I felt uncomfortable with was how hot and humid the restaurant was and how close all the tables and chairs were! 

Overall, if you wanted to look for a Canadian dish like poutine, you should DEFINITELY give this place a chance. I've seen other places around the area that are less descriptive and accommodating to what you personally like as toppings, so having the freedom here to customize poutine in so many different ways, will be beneficial to your stay here in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Very nice, polite and friendly service. We chose to sit on the patio. Not the best looking. No view available. Kind of like sitting in a box but that's ok we chose not to go inside. Poutine was excellent. Very big portions. Delicious."}
{"text":"We came from Old Montreal to try the good old famous Poutine! Well, the service was great, the place was cool, and the poutine... was tasty! First time having it so it took time to get use to the taste, but I dig it."}
{"text":"Poutine! All Day! Everyday! 

This can be done at Poutineville. Just the name alone is pretty obvious of what's on the menu. The best part about this place, it's open late hours, I think it closed at 5am and it was walking distance from our hotel. 

So many poutines to pick from and of course you can make your own custom order! We ended up going with the Montrealer with the smoked meat and the Hat Trick with the hot dogs! Definitely both are tasty...how can you go wrong with meat and fries! And the orders are huge!! Even a regular size was good to share. 

If there's one thing I learned on my trip to Canada, it is that I can eat poutine everyday! And definitely the combinations are endless here at Poutineville."}
{"text":"Honestly, I had high hopes for this place only to have them crashing down upon my experience here. The interior was very nice and clean, and I ordered the Fermier poutine, which was your regular poutine that came with chicken, tomato, and bacon as add-ons. Upon receiving my order, it didn't really look the most appealing, but I decided to give it a chance. It didn't really wow me by any means, and the chicken tasted kind of funky and not exactly the freshest; plus the bacon was either nonexistent or tasted weird. Anyway, I managed to finish the whole thing, but I experienced pretty bad stomach pains within half an hour to an hour after consuming it, so it definitely felt like almost instantaneous food poisoning. As someone who doesn't have any allergies and has a high pain tolerance, I did end up feeling rather frustrated/displeased by everything overall considering that the food exited my body in rather unpleasant ways. I'm reluctant to return again as a result."}
{"text":"Sooner or later I am bound to encounter a place like Poutineville that begs a poutine fiend like myself for a visit. Finding the place was more easier than many have suggested, though maybe I should have done a bit more research, because when I walked in, I was like, \"What, this is a full service sit-in restaurant?!\" Yes, I really was expecting something more like a small take-out place, similar to the Smoke's Poutinerie chain.

An imported concept from Montreal (the land of poutine, eh?), the very hip ambiance of Toronto's Poutineville is kind of a shock, as is the amount of seating to be had. By contrast, the poutine options ranges from greasy classy to shockingly greasy. If you really want a poutine adventure of a lifetime, you could always attempt their $100 'Heart Attack' special. We inquired about what that looked like, and was introduced to a video showing a competitive eater single-handedly wolfing the bastard down (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jltH_Os7pY8).

You can make your own custom poutine, using a form to pick your own ingredients. But it was a midday Monday, and on Mondays they offer most of their specialty decided-for-you poutines for $10. And so me and my friend went for that instead. And added a bit more stuff on top of it like goat cheese and olives, sadly, for an extra charge (refer to the make-your-own form for prices). Granted, the variety of options here are much more adventurous than at Smoke's. Sliced Pogo? Why not?

If you can imagine a shepard's pie with gravy and a melted mess of cheese curds instead of a mashed potato crust, then you pretty much get an idea of what their Shepard's Pie poutine is. The meat-to-fries ratio was ridiculously high; it felt more like eating actual shepard's pie though than a poutine with the lack of fries buried in that whole overwhelming pile of beef, and mixed corn and peas (which honestly tasted like frozen). Maybe I should have had what my buddy had instead: the Hangover. That was a lot more delicious, with a fun sunny-side egg neatly on top. The portions are BLOODY HUGE by the way; what you get is something about the size of a small bowl of pho.

The staff were very pleasant and helpful in answering our questions, providing more detail than we can care for, and engaged in a bit of fun small talk on a bunch of random things, which probably had to do with us being for much of our visit the only customers there. 

The Poutineville food concept is very fun indeed--I wouldn't go as far as declaring it the best poutine in Toronto--but the dark hip bar atmosphere and blaring MTV playlist is kind of scary. Maybe I'm getting old; I'm long past my university days. I'd imagine this being a great place to have a large group of guys hanging out together, getting smashed and maybe, just maybe, attempt to smash through the Heart Attack together.

{"text":"Hier soir j'ai mangé au Poutineville d'Ontario.
Il y avait certes du monde, le service a été long, mais ça reste excusable...
Le concept de faire sa poutine soit même reste fun et les ingrédients de qualité.
On mange à l'assiette et pas dans des barquettes en polystyrène, par contre on boit son coke à la CAN avec une paille ;-)
Néanmoins, le serveur était vraiment mal aimable... Pas souriant, très peu de passage à la table...
Dommage... Il a quand même eu ses 15% et plus de pourboire, vu que les TIPS sont partagés...
Disons que c'était peut-être son mauvais jour..."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of various kinds of poutines! Sure to please with their oversized servings and friendly staff! Never change Poutineville! I can't wait to be inside you and you inside me!"}
{"text":"Wow...you can get a 15lb heart attack poutine for $70!  We saw a huge family get that and it looked delicious.  It actually looked better than the smaller versions we got, since their cheese was super melted, etc.

We got the filet mignon poutine and the regular with the BLT.  The cheese wasn't melted so we asked for them to reheat it.  Both were pretty good but overall, poutine isn't really a meal...or is it?  That's all we ate the weekend we were in Montreal!

Free wifi, yay!"}
{"text":"C'est sur, la poutine est bonne. Le concept de fait ta propre poutine est sympa. Attention la facture peut monter assez vite. Le service à été médiocre, possible que ce soit un cas isolé! Mais ça ne m'empêchera pas d'y retourner."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the most amazing experience at Poutineville today. The food was extraordinary and the service was superb. The owners where there making sure everyone was enjoying themselves. I totally recommend this place! If I could give it 10 stars I would."}
{"text":"I came to Poutineville my first night in Montreal with my boyfriend. We were absolutely starving but wanted to try something authentic from the city. After a quick Yelp search, we walked over to Poutineville completely stunned by how delicious the menu looked. Not only is poutine awesome by itself (fries with goat cheese on top... um hello!) Poutineville basically serves you dinner on top of regular poutine.

The first night my boyfriend had the house special - braised beef, red wine sauce and cheese curds. I had the filet mignon, blue cheese, cheese curds, mushrooms and a nice brown gravy. We were so stuffed, I couldn't even finish the fried pickles we ordered as an appetizer (which are also amazing).

We came back here the next night with five more people and Poutineville has an amazing staff that was more than accommodating! This is THE PLACE to go to for Poutine in Montreal, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Je ne pouvais repartir en France sans être allée à PoutineVille (qui avec la Banquise se chamaillent la place de meilleure poutine dans le coeur des Montrealais)

Le resto ne paye vraiment pas de mine ; sur la table, pas de carte, mais une fiche de case à cocher et un crayon à papier pour faire son choix parmi les tonnes de combinaisons possible de poutine : frites ou patates douces, fromages, légumes, viandes... On ne sait plus s'arrêter !

Et dans l'assiette, c'est du tout bon, les frites sont fondantes et la sauce gravy savoureuse... PoutineVille mérite sa réputation!"}
{"text":"AWESOME Poutine! Every kind imaginable! And if it's not in the menu...you can create it yourself on the personal menu!! The cocktails?? Best we've had in Montreal!! Try the Blackberry Punch or the Bahama Mama! Worth the walk off of the beaten path of St. Catherine street."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of poutineville simply because I can make my poutine the way I want it! I'm addicted to their \"home potatoes\" as well! The sauce is always excellent and they get the whole \"melt the cheese\" thing. I like my poutines \"gratinee\" as well. Sorry for being a terrible human being...

The price-tag is a bit more than a fast food joint but that is to be expected to get \"gourmet poutine\". Every time I came here service has been amazing and so quick. MY CREATIONS are fun to enjoy even when they don't turn out great, I can't blame them, I'm the crazy patron who always want to try something new with them. Something I never do elsewhere.

Awesome place, totally recommend. Good luck on the parking though!"}
{"text":"We took take out and the food was affordable and extremely filling. After we ate we were definitely full, if you are looking for an amazing poutine that will fill you up this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This is the ultimate novelty meal. I'm not too snobby to try out a poutine once in a blue moon. It's hearty and fun to eat! 

I just verified, their gravy and fries are gluten free and the fries are cooked in oil separate from the pogo sticks so it seems like there is no cross contamination. They also offer the option of dairy free cheese.

I just went for the basic poutine, my husband tried the crushed potatoes. The crushed potatoes do taste better however they also tasted extra crunchy and oily so I'm sure the regular cut is healthier. I wouldn't recommend a large unless you are known to have a decent appetite as the regular is perfectly sized for 1 person.

The beer was excellent (I didn't have any due to my gluten allergies but husband loved it)

Service was fast and efficient and the ambiance is nice with music and the hockey game on in the background. They were playing Christmas music seeing that it's Dec 21st. Seems like a cool spot to bring kids, hang out with coworkers, or just to try out a poutine while you're in town!

The greek salad had a little too much Oregano on it for my taste and the feta was crumbled feta and I prefer the cubes of feta.  I wouldn't order that salad again but maybe if you like crumbled feta and extra extra oregano it might be your thing."}
{"text":"Une poutine à fabriquer soi-même, ça te dit? OUI!

Leur spécialité? Patates écrasées et sauce au vin rouge. Ça vaut vraiment la peine de goûter, on est loin des traditionnelles (et un peu tristes) patates frites molles de fond de poutine habituelle. Tu veux des pogos? Ils vont te rajouter des pogos. Même chose pour à peu près tous les fromages et toutes les viandes que tu peux imaginer. 

On y diffuse les sports, souvent. C'est bien pour regarder un match entre amis, mais soyez-y plus tôt que tard, parce que ça se remplit vite. C'est l'endroit idéal pour manger avant ou après une sortie dans le Village, aussi. Amène ta date, tu sauras quoi lui servir pour la suite des choses, puisque chez Poutineville, tout est possible (ou presque!).

Il y a aussi des burgers et autres trucs du genre, mais bon, la vedette, c'est bien sûr la poutine. Le reste est bon aussi! 

Une étoile en moins pour le prix qui monte vite vite vite et pour quelques patates un peu trop frites dans mon assiettes, ça faisait beaucoup CROUNCHE.  Ce n'était pas ma première visite et pas ma dernière non plus. Poutine pour toujours!"}
{"text":"A staple of Canada I've been told is the simple poutine. And being back in Canada it was my duty to give it a try! The restaurant itself was in a nice neighborhood. The menu was very vast and included a lot of options. Many different types of poutine and if you're up for it you can even make your own choices and build your own. I went with the spicy dragon breather. For potatoes I chose house mashed potatoes which turned out to be a great choice. I also added extra cheddar cheese. The dish itself wasn't that spicy but it was good! With the flavor of the spices and peppers blended in with the crunchy fries made for a spectacular combination. For a drink I ordered the cream ale. Next time I'm in Montreal , I'll definitely give this place another visit to try another item on the menu!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the first time i came here. I enjoyed the second time i came here, but unfortunately should've stuck with the poutine i ordered the first time.

The one i ordered had something like Cheese Whiz on it instead of the real cheese curds, and I've never experienced constipation in my life until after i ate this stuff. I was backed up for 2 days before this stuff cleared my system.

Stay away from the Cheese Whiz poutine (that's not what it's called, but you'll know it when you see it listed on the menu)"}
{"text":"Well, unfortunately, place wasn't the best. We went there during poutine fest, we order one meat poutine and one vegetable. We spent almost 40$ (tax and tips included) for potatoes, with some shit on it. For such price you expect sth more sophisticated. We were almost the only client inside, but what you can hear mostly is what just happened in waiters life, because they talk so loud about themself. I'm giving 3 stars, because poutine in general was ok."}
{"text":"Team, I think I'm falling in love. No, not with a woman (if you want a fair assessment of my dating life and romantic capabilities, I'd recommend listening to \"Autoclave\" by the Mountain Goats on repeat and at full volume [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ-2kbculaI]), but rather with a city. Her name? Montreal.

Why would I mention that I'm falling in love with Montreal in a review about a Poutinery? In a survey among Canadians, Poutine was listed as the 10th best Canadian invention (http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/23/dining/23pout.html?_r=2&), and, when paired with a \"Le Cheval Blanc\" wheatbeer seems to function as Montreal's official meal. If you compare that with San Francisco's official meal of organically sourced self-righteous loathing and PBR (or 4 dollar toast, ugh...), you can see why I'm a little in love.

Poutineville gave me my first real taste of true poutine (most of the examples I've eaten in the States are tragic) in their innovative \"Montrealer\", which combined smoked meat, swiss, mushrooms, poutine sauce, and topped with a fried pickle on top. It was incredible. The smoked, pastrami-like meat paired perfectly with the salty, rich sauce, and the broiled-to-crunchy swiss cheese on top rounded everything out perfectly. Paired with the slightly spicy flavors of a Le Cheval Blanc, it was damn near perfect, considering that temperatures outside were hovering around -2 Centigrade. 

As I paid my bill and walked out, the Quebec curling team struck a blow against the undefeated Albertans, the music swelling to vapid chorus proclaiming \"I'm a winner!\", I couldn't help but cheer with the rest of the bar.

Overall: Five Stars. Damn impressive stuff.

Extras:

Accessible by Station Beri-UQAM (Yellow, Orange and Green Lines), and near to the Gare d'autocars.

Service is extraordinarily friendly.

Design-your-own poutine is an available ordering option.

I'm sorely tempted to try the \"Heart Attack\" the next time I'm in Montreal, which consists of five pounds of poutine topped with every-goddamned-delicious-thing-on-the-planet."}
{"text":"Come to Canada to try the real local deal of food. Love the first experience of Poutine. I got the Sherperd's pie with addition of pull pork, tasted excellent and the portion is huge. Love this place."}
{"text":"Awesome Poutine!!! Best I've had so far. Staff was amazing answered all our questions. I see why poutineville is so popular."}
{"text":"Oh my gawd.. the poutine here is SOOO GOOOD! Not that I'm an expert or anything.. but I think after eating it 4 days in a row, my opinion isn't completely useless :)

Came here around 1:30/2am for some late night drunchies and holy moly was I impressed. The fries were double fried to perfection and everything from the gravy to cheese curds were so flavorful! 10/10 would recommend to any tourists/visitors! 

Services was excellent as well. MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"I was very excited when Poutineville first opened. Knowing that this was an AYCE restaurant specifically for poutines, I just had to get in and try it. To my surprise, it's not bad at all. I went today to try their 5 signatures and it was difficult to chomp through all 5. By far, the braised beef and the rocky are both a must. They were both spot on, flavours were popping and just perfect. 

The smoked beef wasn't that great though. It had mushroom and the textures all together didn't work for me. The gravy was a little sweet for my taste. Maybe it was just me. 

One thing I would like to point out is the portion size. For $15, you are getting a decent portion for the poutines. Come here for AYCE on an empty stomach because for sure, you'll leave with a full one."}
{"text":"Been going there a few times. Their poutine is awesome. We always go with the crushed potatoes and always a pleasure. Their House Specialty is a must try. I had the Rocky once, not bad but a poutine without gravy is kind of strange to me. Unless you are very hungry, or else the regular is enough for one person.
My only complain is not enough lighting inside and like another person mentioned, not enough heat inside."}
{"text":"The reviews DO NOT LIE. This place has amazzzzzingggg poutine. JUST COME HERE.

Me and my boyfriend decided to have poutine for breakfast on our last day at Montreal (after a whole weekend of drinking, why not cure it with animal fat and cheese curds?)

I got the Samplier ($11) which was their house poutine and also sweet potato poutine. It blows your tastebuds away.. and the thing is their portions are larger than you would expect. I had to take half of it to go.

My boyfriend made his own, a regular with mushrooms, onions, philly steak and LOTS of cheese. It was basically a philly cheese steak, but in poutine form. 

The great thing about this place is that the toppings just aren't on the top of the fries like many poutine places. No, they got toppings everywhere hidden in the fries. 

The service is also really good, and the server was attentive (but then again we were the only people in the entire restaurant...).

Overall if I was visiting Montreal again, I would definitely come here again. WHY DON'T PLACES MAKE MORE SWEET POTATO POUTINE?! Now I have to go complain to Smoke's *sigh*."}
{"text":"Perhaps second time is a charm because the first one sure wasn't memorable. On a cold summer day many years back (cuz it's Montreal and it's ALWAYS cold) I chanced upon this fancy poutine joint with table service and all. I was lead to believe that somehow table service with a French accent and limitless options for your poutine is a sure winner. Several years later, thinking back all I can say is...MEH. I can see the appeal to the masses; variety and variety with a French label.

It's both a blessing and a curse that this infamous place has made inroads in our great city. For one, it will put some pressure on the likes of the Smokes empire to step up their game from just feasting on the poor souls of this city that have never had a well made poutine. Unfortunately, they do bring more mediocrity as well and a misconception that a good poutine must have 15 ingredients and limitless options. I would say they are definitely one-up over Smokes for sure but maybe just half a step up.

The only shiny star of this meal was the gravy. It's flavourful and light like liquid gold. The other components are lackluster to say the least. I had their house special potatoes instead of fries and my gums still hurt from all that gnawing. This stuff is triple-fried perhaps? Not sure but I felt like I was a rock crusher. The cheese is decent and the rest of the ingredients taste like they should - unremarkable."}
{"text":"I never really liked poutine before. Not that I thought it was bad but I just could not have more that 2-3 bites. Well once my little brother came home with a poutine he picked up there and made me reconsider. It was loaded with goat cheese and bacon and covered in red wine sauce. I decided to go a few months later and I was not disappointed. They had very big portions too so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick bite of classic Poutine and we weren't disappointed. The cheese curds were big, fresh, and squeaky. The gravy was thick and robust and the fries were hot. The dish overall was phenomenal but the fries lacked flavor. A little spice would go a long way. The ambience was what you'd expect for a Poutine bar--casual with the Canadiens game on the TV. The servers were very attentive to our needs and were happy to answer our questions."}
{"text":"In the category of poutine this place was hands down the best we had while in town.  The staff was awesome, the food was great.  it was a little pricey for a pile of potatoes, but worth it for sure.  I dig the \"choose your own adventure\" approach, tho prescribed combos are also available.  Decidedly higher quality ingredients than most poutine competitors as well."}
{"text":"Meilleure resto de poutine pour les garnitures variees et les grosses portions! Les frites ecrasees sont trop bonnes, mais la sauce est ordinaire. Le reste sur le menu est pas mal, j'ai essaye les burgers et rien a redire! 

Mon conseil, manger une poutine sur mesure! Ca vaut la peine."}
{"text":"Love the plethora of options they have here, and the fact that they offer vegan options and sweet potato fries so I can bring friends with certain food allergies here. The pepper gravy is probably my favourite. Even the smallest order was far too much for me, so unless you have a huge appetite you can probably split an order between two people."}
{"text":"I attempted to go for the one year anniversary but once I found out they we're not giving the dollar poutine for take out, I promptly left. I didn't sit because my fiance doesn't like poutine and it was obviously too crowded and busy.  Their Facebook and website did not state that at all, so rather disappointing. My fiance suggested I shun them for life, but I opted to give them a second chance, because after all, it's poutine.

So second chance, around 9:30 on a Friday night, it's nearly empty with a few tables occupied. I ordered the basic poutine with bacon. For a place that specializes in one thing, it really sucked. The fries were soggy and undercooked, the gravy was watery and tasteless, canned gravy would have been an improvement, and the curds were rationed like it was hard to come by. The bacon was even worse, mostly fat (even for bacon) and undercooked as well. Also smelled like it had maple syrup or something on it. I'm really not sure about the hype of this place."}
{"text":"lovely service by the (possibly) french girl who works here! super friendly and accomodating.

the hawgtown and pizza poutine were awesome! such huge portions!"}
{"text":"Poutine, oh poutine! Combien c'est plaisant quand tu es si bien concoctée! 

On se dit souvent que c'est simple de faire une bonne poutine. Pourtant, tant de restaurants la manque... Heureusement, ce n'est pas le cas ici! Avec un nombre infini de possibilités, Poutineville vous laisse le soin de choisir vos propres ingrédients, sortes de frites, sauce, en passant par toutes les viandes et les condiments imaginables (ou presque)! Et si vous n'avez pas d'inspirations, ils vous en suggère quelques unes. Dans mon cas, j'y ai goûté avec frites écrasées et avec frites de patates douces. Dans les deux cas, c'était vraiment bien cuit; juste assez de crouistillant à l'extérieur pour résister à la sauce. Et la sauce? Excellente! Juste assez épaisse pour que chaque bouchée de patates et de fromage soit bien couverte. 

À essayer!"}
{"text":"The best poutine in montreal, worth the price, the big one is more than sufficient for 2 person."}
{"text":"Not incredible, but definitely the superior option for late night poutine. Word of warning though- the portions are enormous."}
{"text":"When planning out my Montreal trip, I was doing some research on things to try in Montreal. Poutine was the first thing that popped on every site. I thought I was going to have a heart attack just reading all the ingredients that make up a Poutine. So basically it's french fries with curd cheese, sausage, and a special gravy sauce drizzled on top. After actually trying it, I Liked It! We found a really good one in Latin Quarters, but Poutineville wasn't bad at all. You get to customize your poutine based on preference at Poutineville. The gravy sauce they used here was delicious, despite how messy our dish looked. This place is a little off city center, so if you don't want to travel far, definitely try some in Latin Quarters.

Tartufo is a MUST here! It's a little different than how it's made in the States, but this was DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"We visited Old Town Montreal for the weekend for some shopping, wandering around, and for some great food.

Poutineville is a little bit off the beaten path, and isn't right in the old town area, but it's well worth the wander.  Great beer and poutine was amazing.

Had the environment of being a local spot rather than being flooded with tourists (which is always good), and the staff was incredibly pleasant."}
{"text":"Probably the best poutine in Montreal but to much wait to share this poutine with friends.
No reservations!!?? Are we crazy enough to wait 20/30 minutes to share a poutine with some friends??"}
{"text":"Really nice selection of poutines and reasonably friendly staff. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great twist on a provincial classic. The mashed fries option is a must!

Make your own poutine will have you pick between: 4 Types of fries, 9 cheese selection, a dozen veggie and meat options and don't forget the 5 gravy possibilities... Last but not least you can have them make it gratin!

Good local beers on tap. Expect to spend between $10-15 if the blend traditional poutine isn't part of your evening. Add a few bucks more for a larger portion.

Tourist disclaimer... This isn't the best place for a first experience as some of the options may overwhelm your taste buds. So if you left your tour guide behind opt for the traditional menu and bon appetit."}
{"text":"Wastin away again in Poutineville,
Searching for toppings, I can't halt,
Some claim that it's a woman's mind to blame
But I know it's probably our fault.

This is what happens when you have 3 women go to Poutineville, It took us a good 20 minutes to order, with one who clearly knew what she wanted, another trying to decide which would be the best choice, and then me, who doesn't often deviate from the original version.  During our indecisiveness, the first kept piling on the choose your own toppings in the \"Create Your Own\", the Second one gets it just right, with a lot of spice, and I decided to be daring, and add sweet potato fries, and mushrooms to my curds and original sauce. 

Our server was lovely, and although I had heard much about the place, I just don't find myself over in that area to go, so for my first time visit, I was pleased as a poutine. 

In case you're wondering about what my first friend chose:
Regular fries, braised beef, mushrooms, red wine sauce, with curds, mozzarella, and peas. (She's from Vancouver)

2nd: 
Italian Sausage, spicy peppers, sweet potato fries, 3 pepper sauce, curds

Oh and ps they have a $70 poutine on the menu featuring 5lbs of fries and I can't remember what else, because I was too busy trying to think of what 5lbs of fries would look like. 

But, go. try it. Great service, patient, and I don't think of poutine as being weird here really, it's just a twist on the classic, and I stayed close to the classic, and it was yummy!"}
{"text":"The only thing better than this Poutine in the service from my waiter Costa. My pulled pork Poutine needs to be served in every restaurant in Texas because the BBQ mixed with the Potato and Peppers is amazing. More Please!"}
{"text":"My sister and friend were visiting Montréal for the first time so of course they demanded that we sample the local poutine before leaving. Having had my fair share of poutine from both the Northeast and Quebec, my expectations were tempered. Afterall, how many different variations can you do with fries, cheese curds, and gravy?

After a quick search, Poutineville was one of the few, high-rated places that was open on a Monday. The menu offers a number of different poutine combinations and even allows you to construct your own, much like The Counter for burgers. We settled on the house special, Poutineville, which was cheese curds, mozzarella, braised beef, and wine sauce all over crushed potatoes. 

I can't say it was one element that separated and elevated this poutine from any other I've had, because it was everything. The crushed potatoes were great because it gave it a crispy texture that goes missing when most fries become soggy under the gravy. The braised beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender and the wine sauce really tied the gravy and cheese together. We split a large between three people, which was enough, but I still wanted more. Délicieux!"}
{"text":"The staff is SO nice and the food is pretty good. Let's be real, it's hard to mess up Poutine, but this food warmed my soul and the portion was large enough to provide leftovers. 
Works for me."}
{"text":"This is my first poutine, and it was fantastic. Tried to go to La Banquise, but didn't want to wait 45+ minutes in the 25º weather, so we stopped in here and were happy we did. The co-owner took great care of us and the food was excellent."}
{"text":"The variety here cannot be beat. You can order one of their pre-set poutines, or you can do a custom on a handy sheet they give you, ticking off what type of fries, gravy, and toppings you want. Portions were suuuper generous: two people will definitely get full off of one order. We ordered three for five of us, and later that night three of my friends shared a large order we took to-go. Beers can be pretty cheap; they had specials if there were hockey games on, but even so pitchers were a decent price. 

There was a long line when we went around prime dinner time (7 pm), but the hostess found a place to squeeze us in fairly quickly. If you are willing to wait, eat there, because the order we took to go wasn't as good after the gravy and cheese curds got cold."}
{"text":"Eating a plate of poutine was my main culinary goal on the trip to Montréal, so JJ and I hit up Poutineville for lunch as soon as we could. The vibe in this joint is pretty casual, with no nonsense decor--the poutine is the star.

I bypassed the \"Create Your Own\" menu because, frankly, I was a little overwhelmed by the amount of choice. I was surprised that there were so many options and would definitely take advantage of that next time. Instead, I ordered a regular-sized \"Hat Trick,\" which boasted 3 meats (hot dogs, bacon, and minced beef), cheese curds, regular-cut fries, and gravy. The curds were an unusual experience and gave a bit of resistance as I chewed (I assume this is the correct texture). It was delicious, but I just couldn't muster the strength to finish it.

A nice selection of beer rounds out the menu, so JJ and I split a pint. This of course went perfectly with the poutine, and I would absolutely come back again next time I'm in the city."}
{"text":"Very good , good service too. Create your own poutine or take a pick from chefs creations"}
{"text":"What a GREAT restaurant... I was nervous that it would be a little cartoonish due to the name but this place was perfection. We ordered the house special and the braised beef couldn't have been more tender! I love all of the choices for the most creative of poutine creations. With poutine in the name how can you go wrong?! My only regret is not ordering TWO!"}
{"text":"Did I get really good customer service or really bad?  I can't decide.

Came here since I have never tried it, and last time I was in town I went to La Banquise.  Had a coupon for free \"add bacon,\" too.  Ordered the classique, and asked for the large so I could take half home for later.

The waiter was super friendly in helping me order and bringing me my food.  Unfortunately, he realized that the kitchen made me a regular.  He told me it should be enough for me.  He was right, but that wasn't the point, I wanted leftovers!!

When the check came ($8.05 with tax) I gave the guy $10.05 and he said, \"Are you good?\" implying he wanted that $2 as a tip.  Of course he did.  Normally I would have been happy to give him the $2, but my order was wrong.  I was planning on giving him $1 but basically he hustled me into leaving the $2.  Can't blame the guy for trying to make good tips, though.

The poutine was great, by the way.  I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went a couple of times, and each time I was a bit disappointed. I really like the 'poutine' meal and i can get really serious into it... haha..

The first time I went, the service was terrible. The place was filled with two groups and they were so loud we couldn't even heard our conversation. But hey, it's not really the fault of the owner, you don't really decide what group will come. So that was okay. 

We ordered two separate poutine each (2 small) with the home fries and the home gravy. The concept is good, you choose what you want in your poutine, it's like choosing your topping on a pizza. From there, everything looks great, the place is not high-end, it's a bit cheap, but don't expect too much, they serve poutine. 

When the poutine arrived, we were shocked. It was a soup, more than a poutine. I don't know if it's the home fries that don't absorb as much liquid as the traditional fries, but everything was wet, and boring. There is a certain kick to the sauce that I didn't get use to. The vegetable (pepers in my case) were not cook at all, so it was crunchy. Weird solid-crunchy-wet texture. My friend didn't like it either.

On our second visit, everything was more balanced. The ambiance was much more c.lm. We ordered big poutine instead of two small ones. Everything was way better, but again, the sauce turned me off, and the size of the fries too. It's like big potato pieces, uncook, and sometimes way too big, sometimes way too small. 

We also went to the one on Ontario. The staff and ambiance was better. But the poutine was the same. For a poutine shop, i was not quite satisfied, but you know what? If I want a poutine, i'll stop by, because afterall, it's good. 

Up side : The concept is really cool. You decide the ingredients and fashion of your poutine. Price is good, a bit expensive tho. Food is good, but not great. 

Downside : i was anticipating better food. the ambiance is so-so. 

I will go again if I feel like eating a poutine."}
{"text":"This place is a must if you're visiting Montreal! You have a menu of what seems like infinite combinations. You can also make your own poutine if you're feeling creative."}
{"text":"I came here years ago and was finally able to come back! It was just as amazing as i remembered!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Montreal on our way back to Toronto from Quebec City in our quest to find the perfect poutine. After minutes of researching on Yelp ( we were starving ), we decided to settle with Poutineville! Best decision ever! 

Here's why: The Poutineville. It's poutine to perfection! The crushed potatoes made it so crispy and you don't get too sick of the potatoes even after you're half way done. Braised beef was the perfect topping to the chewy cheese curd - just how it should be. 

We're so ( so so so so) happy to discover that they finally opened up in Toronto! We're even happier to know we finally have a go to place whenever we crave delicious poutine!"}
{"text":"After trying out La Banquise and Poutineville, which are arguably the contenders for best poutine in Montreal, I have to say Poutineville definitely comes ahead for me. I love to make one with the special fries, blue cheese, braised beef, and pepper sauce! The service is great every time I go."}
{"text":"Quality went down, there is no cheese in my poutine!!! Poutineville is a screw now!!! Junk"}
{"text":"The poutine is legit. It's owned and run by an actual Quebecer, who has other restaurants in Montreal. Prices are reasonable considering the portion size, and the fact that you're actually getting real poutine.

It's truly a strange venue. It's somewhat hidden because it resides in the former theatre behind Future's Bakery.

As a result, the store signs are much higher up than normal, and there is strange fencing on either side of the entrance which gives the wrong impression of what's inside.

When you finally get near the door, it's still a bit strange. As you are immediately faced with a long bar. Only further down does the place open up and become a sit down restaurant.

Adding to the confusion are the multiple menus. There are standard fold out menus, but also sheets of paper + pencils for custom poutine orders.

On a saturday night, the place was lively. Music was pumping (enough to bother those who are sensitive), and the corresponding music video was playing on mounted flat screens. The bar was surprisingly full with about 20-30 people mulling around.

I suggest that you ignore the mixed messaging and simplify. 

This is a strong consideration if you're looking for a quality poutine. The newly renovated venue is a nice bonus. There are few poutine joints in the city where you can actually sit and enjoy your meal with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed this place.. Ordered \"The Poutineville\" -  fries, braised beef, gravy, cheese curds. Can't go wrong with that.   Also tried the \"Filet Mignon\", very good  as well, but I liked the the Poutineville more. 

I would imagine this place is the best at 2:00 AM after a night of drinks, though it made for a great lunch with a beer."}
{"text":"This place serves classic POUTINE in the greatest variations. You can make your own custom one or choose one of several delicious tried and trues. Absolute must visit for a Montreal tour."}
{"text":"The best poutine hands down. Smashed fries were like cottage fries. Better than getting the standard as they were crispier. You could customize your poutine. We got braised beef, mushrooms, onions and chose a mix of pepper and wine sauce.  It was amazing. I wasn't even in the mood for poutine but I had to eat it.  So glad our hotel recommended it to us. We had to hit this place a second time before we left town. Funny enough, they had a location at the next city we went to right across the street from our hotel, but by then, unfortunately, we were poutined out."}
{"text":"La poutineville for me, fries were good, the meat was good, the gravy was pretty good. No complaints. Boyfriend had filet mignon poutine, hold the blue cheese, which was also pretty good. Onion rings, thumbs up. Cream ales on the side. Good service, good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the past couple of months. The staff are great, there are tons of choices for different toppings for your poutine. They have all-you-can-eat Tuesdays (where you order lots of little kinds of poutine). Still trying to find a good reason to justify going to this, but I will! I like this place - it's fun, funky and different from anything else out there. The decor is clean and modern. Definitely a cool and fun place to go eat/hang out with friends!"}
{"text":"I would say that this place is a staple if making your first trip to Montreal! Great experience of having poutine just the way you want it, or you could also go with one of their creations. 

I built my own with ground beef, blue cheese and red wine gravy and my life's purpose has been fulfilled. My friends ordered a few of the creations, and while they were great, I still loved mine the most."}
{"text":"The poutines here are absolutely incredible and so huge! We got a montrealer and added cheese curds to get the full montreal experience. Shared it between three people (although one person didnt eat that much) and we barely finished and were super stuffed! The crushed potato fries are incredible - soft in the middle and crunchy on the outside! Gravy was delicious, cheese curds were squeaky and so flavorful. Everyone needs to try this place!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I had in Montreal. Everyone in out group had a different poutine. I especially enjoyed the hangover special. But everyone enjoyed theirs equally, I think. Good spot for vegetarians, given the variety. Nice beer selection on draft."}
{"text":"love this place, my opinion the best poutine in mtl. you have to try the tex mex witch isnt on the menu but is great.and you have to try a poutine with the crushed potatoes. the service is  great."}
{"text":"Ok so decided to try this local place tonight, we were 4 people and boy oh boy after we had to wait  over 1 hour for 4 simple poutine, we got up and had to leave unacceptable! The manager just shrug her shoulders no apology at all. The place was reasonably busy buy there was no reason to have to wait so long! They will never see me there again. Very unprofessional! Over hyped & over priced. Not worth the time"}
{"text":"Nice bright little spot out on Ontario that I was glad to be introduced to by the charming MP. Basic decor, simple wooden tables and chairs, chill friendly perfectly bilingual staff and poutines that go beyond the usual. I went for the mashed fries, curd cheese, red wine gravy, lots of veggies and smoked meat. I would have been happier with more smoked meat but I loved the combination of flavours, fresh and not too greasy. And honestly, even when burnt out and brain tired post event I do do do love checking options off a little paper to make my own magic poutine combo."}
{"text":"I heard about an AYCE (all you can eat) poutine place and since I do like fries/poutine, I decided to give it a try. The AYCE poutine is only on Tuesdays after 5pm so I went there after work.

When I went into Poutineville, it wasn't too crowded (I arrived a few minutes after 5pm). When I was seated, the waitress gave me 2 poutine menus. The first menu was for customized poutines where you specified everything from what types of potatoes you wanted, to the type of cheese, meats, vegetables, and poutine sauce you wanted (with each item carrying a certain cost) and the second menu comprised of what I will call poutines \"with names\" meaning the items in the poutine were pre-specified on the menu which had a fixed price.

I didn't see any mention of the all you can eat poutine special at this Poutineville which surprised me (nothing advertised/posted on the wall or written in their menu) so I asked the waitress about it and she confirmed that there was an all you can eat poutine special on Tuesday after 5pm. The cost for this was $15+taxes (& tip). She informed me how the AYCE poutine worked. The poutine choices for the AYCE were limited to ~5 items from their regular poutine menu (Hat Trick, Farmer's Delight, Zeus, Classic, and Philly Steak). She also let me know that I would start off with 2 choices and then after that, I could continue to order but she would only bring 1 choice at a time. I decided to have the AYCE poutine special as opposed to ordering something specific from their menu or making my own poutine from their list of items. I also ordered a draft beer ($6.50+taxes (& tip)).

The \"Hat Trick\" comprised of fresh crispy fries, bacon, minced beef, sliced hot dogs, cheese curds, and poutine sauce.

The \"Farmer's Delight\" comprised of crispy fries, chicken, bacon, tomatoes, cheese curds, and poutine sauce

The \"Zeus\" comprised of hand crushed potatoes, tomatoes, red onions, cheese curds, feta cheese, slices of gyro, and red wine sauce

The \"Classic\" comprised of fries, cheese curds, and poutine sauce

The \"Philly Steak\" comprised of crispy fries, philly steak, sauteed mushrooms & onions, green peppers, cheese curds, nacho cheese, and poutine sauce.

I tried all the items and personally I liked the \"Hat Trick\" and the \"Philly Steak\" the most. I had a somewhat large lunch so I barely could try all the items.

When I finished, I asked the waitress for my bill and I noticed that I was overcharged for the AYCE poutine. I was charged $15 for it and I also received a charge of a single poutine (Classic) which should have been included as part of the AYCE price. I mentioned this to the waitress and she apologized when she noticed that I got charged for a classic poutine."}
{"text":"De passage à Montréal, j'ai pu tester le concept de Poutineville : de la Poutine, mais en version DIY !
Sur une base frites (au choix classiques, fines, de patates douces ou écrasées), on ajoute en cochant une feuille des ingrédients : fromage, légumes, viande, sauce. Au choix, avec certains surcoût selon les ingrédients. Le résultat est surprenant, gargantuesque.
Si vous êtes en manque d'inspiration, des recettes diverses sont aussi proposées.
À déguster avec une Belle Gueule. Je parle de la bière évidemment ;)"}
{"text":"Solid, low-key spot to grab a variety of poutines. More options on the menu than I knew existed for poutine. Also quite affordable for the portion sizes."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong when you have the option of making your own poutine. Different type of fries, gravy, cheese and then the availability of extra toppings on top. Large plate of poutine is a whole meal by itself, under $20 you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Great concept, make your own poutine. I had the same problem as another reviewer- some of my fries were cold. Maybe  they just make a bunch of fries and if they don't get used add the next batch to those? This really ruined what would have been a delicious poutine- fresh squeaky cheese curds and tasty sauce."}
{"text":"De bonnes poutines, le fait de pouvoir personnaliser son plat de A à Z est vraiment pas mal."}
{"text":"Simply great! Delicious food,  fresh with lots of options. Everyone is nice and friendly."}
{"text":"i like the variety and the creative takes here on the classic poutine dish consisting of fries, gravy and cheese curds. however, i think you have to REALLY like poutine to finish the ginormous sized portions that are served here. for my friend and i, it was a bit too much about halfway through.

i will say that poutine makes a fabulous craving satisfier for hangry people, and is especially good after a long night of drinking (hence why they stay open until 5am).

i like that they serve sangria here (though watered down), even though sangria does not go with poutine one bit.

and, although poutineville is very popular with locals and tourists alike, there is never too long of a wait because of the high turnover and the large space/capacity inside. we only waited 5-10 mins at 8pm on a saturday night. and bonus: al fresco dining!

service here is exceptionally friendly. nothing less than what i would expect from our friends north of the border."}
{"text":"Apres quelques visites, je peux affirmer que le service est toujours excellent. Bon choix de biere et la sangria est bonne aussi. La poutine est excellente, les patates maison sont parfaites. Il n'y a pas de resto offrant un plus grand choix d'excellente poutine. J'y vais des que le temps me le permet."}
{"text":"If you don't eat here, your trip to Montreal was a waste."}
{"text":"For months we been trying to check out Poutineville. We were nicely greeted and we were given a large table. Alex our server explained the menu. Which was well appreciated. Since the key to Poutineville is build your own poutine with  starting with the fries type , toppings and gravy. We started off with an order of fried pickles and  Cheese Quesadillas which were 4,5 star  each.
We each ordered a different type of  poutine with manny extras toppings , The 2 key components to a great poutine is the fries and the gravy. The difference between a good poutine and a great poutine is the way the fries are prepared and served , Poutineville offers 4 types of potatoes fries. Sweet potatoes , regular cut , shoe string , and crushed . The crushed fries were amazing crispy and soft in the middles . That is the way to go!
The only negative is we all found the regular poutine gravy a little thick and dark in colour. But was only worth 3 star .Poutineville offers  others gravies to try . Over all It was a great experience and the idea of building your poutine is a fun experience. There was one item on the menu which caught our attention only if we were a large group  of at least 6 people who were gong to eat poutine and that  was the Heart attack poutine . They say it weighs 15 lbs but in reality it's is only 5 lbs of fries . And about 10 lbs of toppings . Poutineville is good experience from the original poutine because of the varieties /combination of poutines toppings they offer . Also needs to be mentioned that they do offer salads and sandwiches for those who do not eat poutine.  The ones in our group who ordered sandwiches said they were good the said it was 3,5 Stars I  feel that Poutineville only gets 4 stars  since the gravy was not good as the original ones we grew  up on  and Alex our server 5 star  was excellent . We will be back when we have friends from out of town who want to try poutine."}
{"text":"Take \"Subway\" subtract everything boring and crappy about it (and healthy), sub the sandwiches for poutine with dozens of topping options and you got poutineville! The atmosphere is modern and less \"hip\" than banquist. Red and black walls, full bar, chandelier. Upon arriving they hand you a long piece of a paper with options for your potatoes (get the house special potatoes!) different cheeses, meats, veggies and sauces! Most toppings run between 1.25-2.00 depending on the topping. A poutine after adding about 4 toppings usually averages around $12. I really enjoy \"designing\" my own poutine. Great concept!"}
{"text":"Omg the poutine is sooo good. Nice fast food joint. I had this amazing poutine that was covered with bacon, cheddar, sour cream and shallot. The staff is very friendly and ready to recommend the best choices."}
{"text":"Had the two sampler poutine, bad bad choice! Should of sticked with the classical ones. If you could, don't order take out! When I took the poutine home, everything was not good. But don't be disappointed in this restaurant! I believe my experience was just a odd occurrence."}
{"text":"Dropped by mid-afternoon on Sunday for a quick snack with some of my American friends (after all, no trip to Canada would be complete without a poutine experience)! I took them here hoping that this would give them the best poutine experience I could find in Toronto. Oddly, service seemed a touch slow, especially considering how empty the place was. Apart from that, the service was courteous.

I don't like to trick out my poutine with all sorts of weird toppings. I opted to try their traditional poutine -- straight cut fries, cheese curds, and standard gravy. Then I opted for the crushed fries, pepper gravy, and cheese curds. The latter of these was a far superior experience.

The traditional poutine did not overly impress and it was quite reminiscent of poutine from Poutini's. Good, but nothing special. The crushed fries on the other hand are definitely unique and a welcome newcomer to my poutine experience. I also much preferred the pepper gravy over the traditional gravy. So if you're giving this place a shot, definitely give the pepper gravy and crushed fries a go. 

As I left the restaurant, I looked back at the sign and pulled an Arnold, \"I'll be back.\" It was unintentional - I probably sounded like that because of how bloated I was from all the poutine. But oh yes, it was worth it."}

{"text":"I've been to Montreal a few times and I've tried poutine at a bunch of different places around the city but I keep coming back to Poutineville as my favorite.  I get the house special with braised beef, its glorious."}
{"text":"La meilleure Poutine de Montréal.. avec possibilité de faire sa propre Poutine sur mesure !!! N'est-ce pas génial ? Allez y les yeux fermés !
 Ps: leur sangria ne sont pas mal non plus !"}
{"text":"Fantastic. We ordered the classic poutine and the poutineville special. Yummy. The special was a unanimous thumbs up. Fries, braised beef, cheese, and wine sauce. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Had the Heart attack poutine with some friends. For the price of 70$ + txes, you can get a HUGE poutine with bacon,sausage, grounded beef, ham, chicken, green pepper, onions, mushroom, mozzarella cheese and cheesecurds to fully fill the stomach of 7 hungry people!! Excellent sauce and combination, I will definitely go back there some other day."}
{"text":"Du choix, du choix et encore du choix. C'est poutineville. J'en ai tant entendu parlé. Un samedi soir, je décide d'y aller avec mon mari. Il y a une file. Je m'y attends. Après un attente d'un vingtaine de minutes nous sommes finalement assis. Un peu coincé et collé à notre table voisine, mais j'imagine que c'est ce qui fait le charme des petits restos de montréal comme celui-ci. L'attente du notre plat est très longue. Les protions sont généreuses. Toutefois, j'ai été déçue. Je mets la faute aux frites qui nous ont été servis un peu froide. Je vais quand même leur donner une deuxième chance car les commentaires sur ce restaurant sont toujours très positifs."}
{"text":"I visitors this restaurant with my fiancée for dinner , hoping to eat some great poutine. We were not disappointed! The food was great, portion sizes very large, and good beer. The waitress was very nice and did her best to help us out with translating the French. She also gave us FANTASTIC recommendations on where to go for desert. If you're in the area, it's a fun spot to visit."}
{"text":"Very tasty. I went with the specialty, which was braided beef, mozzarella, curd, and wine sauce on potatoes. It was great.

The staff was friendly and, noticing we were tourists, brought us English menus.

The large open doors made it a great place to sit and people watch."}
{"text":"I can't compare this place to popular sppts like La Banquise, but the poutine here is great (disclaimer: my third time eating poutine because American). The portion size is great - I couldn't finish the small sized house special. Like other commenters have described the cheese curds were squeaky, gravy was flavorful and not overly salty. Since I had the house special the fries were replaced with smaller chunks of potatoes. No complaints about the service."}
{"text":"One of the only places that I like their poutines a lot ! Since the fries are made super well not too soft ! Just perfect ! However the environment and the place isn't that clean to me !!!"}
{"text":"Had the house special poutine.  Different type of poutine but really good.  Instead of french fries, it is more like home style fries.  Good service too.  Worth trying!"}
{"text":"delicious poutine. WOW. the steak one...expensive as it is..sooo gooddd. i wish we ordered a large, we only got regular and that wasn't enough. Then we ordered a large one of the famous LA POUTINEVILLE poutine and that was okay...we got leftovers that we ended up eating later at night so that was fine. The lychee martini was good and strong. So happy they spoke english, had to ask for an english menu after i was like..so i can't read french...awesome music they were pumping until halfway when they cut it. :("}
{"text":"All you can eat poutine every tuesday, the staff is great, nice place. Prices are not high."}
{"text":"This spot is simply Awesome!

We started with the 911 wings which weren't all that spicy but were absolutely delicious!  

We ordered the Montrealer Poutine, Hangover Poutine and the fish and chips.  Everything was very tasty and lived upto my expectations.

Our server was very friendly and attentive.  Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"When we arrived at 7.30pm on a Saturday the restaurant was already busy. Once seated you are given the option of customizing your own poutine or selecting from a menu where there is a recommended list of combinations. 
Mainly because I'm not good with making decisions I went for an already tried and tested menu option from the speciality poutines called the Farmers Delight. This came with crushed potatoes, chicken, bacon, tomatoes, cheese curds topped off with a delicious gravy. The portion size is very generous and it isn't just filled with the golden brown crispy potatoes, there was plenty of juicy tomatoes and meat. I was full about a third of the way in. Perfect comfort food for a wet chilly day!"}
{"text":"Great service. Create your own poutine dish! Lots to choose from - vegetables, cheeses, vegetables and more.
Only good things to say about this place. Clean and lots of seating, outdoor as well."}
{"text":"poutineville is a classic. great experience. delicious poutine. caring waiters/waitresses. The price of the poutine was fair. I recommend the house special.

If you're in Montreal you must check it out."}
{"text":"We visited Montreal and had to make sure we tried the best poutine.  The reviews pointed to Poutineville and they did not disappoint.  Some of us enjoyed the combinations that were already put together.  The hangover was perfect for the day after St Pattys Day.  Others made their own combination with no lack of choices or combinations. Service was friendly and attentive although they were very busy on a Saturday afternoon.  You have created a fan of Poutine for life!"}
{"text":"Un autre bon resto basé sur les pitounes. Comparable a la Banquise ou poutine centrale. Serveur par contre aurai pue sembler un petit peut plus \"amical\". Sinon pour le reste rien a dire à pare du positif."}
{"text":"Mon endroit favori pour une bonne poutine! Tu peux y aller avec tes goûts et tes envies du moment puisque tu remplis toi-même ta fiche \"poutine\". Je conseille vraiment les frites écrasées! C'est un délice!!

Le prix sont très abordables, le staff est super gentil !!"}
{"text":"Cool lounge music, open air dining room, and a fun build your own poutine menu. Poutineville was a nice find in downtown Montreal. We enjoyed the service and overall dining experience. 

What was surprising was the other food items were better than the poutine. We've also had better poutine elsewhere, but their poutine was not bad. They use pickled jalapeños and we just had poutine with fresh grilled jalapeños. It's hard to compete with fresh! Portions here are huge though. 

The chicken sandwich was perfect - tender chicken, fresh veggies, nicely toasted bread. An up charge of $2 for poutine is the way to enjoy a great meal here. Best of both worlds."}
{"text":"Amazing poutine!!! Definitely something you need to try if you're visiting Montreal. Great atmosphere and nice waiters. I ordered the Shepherds Pie Poutine and it was DE-LI-CIOUS!!! Definitely 5 stars"}
{"text":"First time trying poutine. I got classic (French fries, cheese curds, and poutine gravy) with mushroom. And it was just eh. Not sure why people are crazy about poutine in Canada. It's pretty good, but I'm not a crazy fan of fries or cheese, so it was just not for me. At least, I finally got to try the famous Montreal dish and learn what it tastes like. Service was really nice - I told the server that I've never had poutine before, and he went through the menu with me and brought up some popular options."}
{"text":"Best Poutine I've had in my life.  Get the traditional (with crushed fries), without a doubt.  We ordered two, and the more experimental one didn't turn out as good.  There is surely a good combo to go with the sweet potato fries, but we didn't find it.  Want to hit the best food in Montreal?  Go here and Schwartz' :)"}
{"text":"Just visited last week and had the traditional and the  Rocky since I'm from Philly. Well done. Excellent blend of styles with the local custom. The house wine sauce is tasty and really makes the flavored meat marinate in your mouth like a celebration of Poutine Pride! As for the Rocky, authentic wiz cheese. A little too heavy on the onions but I picked them out and survived .  The staff was well attentive with refills and the restroom was very clean. Super friendly staff with Americans. 

Great family spot. Tourist friendly."}
{"text":"Poutineville is perfection!  We dined here on a Sunday evening during dinnertime, and it was quite busy.  By the time we left, there were a few people standing in a line near the door waiting to be seated.  I think we grabbed the last 2-seat table, so heads up, this place gets busy!  But it is well worth the wait.

Our server was friendly and prompt giving us English menus.  The menu itself offers plenty of poutine options.  Haven't had poutine?  Fries, cheese curds, gravy.  That's it (basically).  For the picky or undecided, there's a build-you-own poutine options with a variety of meats, cheeses, veggies, and sauces to add at your discretion.

I ordered the \"House Poutine,\" which is more of a traditional poutine:  fries, cheese curds, mozzarella and braised beef with a red wine sauce.  A regular portion is $12, and trust me you do not need anything more than the regular portion, because it is HUGE.  Poutineville does the fries right; they didn't get soggy like I experienced at other places.  The cheese curds were plentiful, chewy, and squeaky as they should be; and the gravy/sauce was just right.

I also tried a bite of my husband's poutine:  the Fire Alarm.  Again, it's a plate of fries, cheese curds, and gravy, with the difference being hot sauce and TOPPED with hot chicken wings.  I wasn't as crazy about this one; I didn't like the hot sauce flavor with the other ingredients.

The beer selection is decent.  The Le Cheval Blanc wheat beer went nicely with our meals.  But truthfully, the poutine is so filling that you may want to skip the beer!

There isn't much of a cocktail or wine menu, but it isn't really needed.

A MUST for any visitor to Montreal.  We tried two poutine places in Montreal, and this one was the best!"}
{"text":"Well, I learned the correct way to say Poutine while in Montreal (not what I originally thought) and I also learned that Poutine doesn't have to be just cheese curds and gravy on fries. This place has all the options! We tried the traditional but then also placed an order for the smashed fries with 911 spicy gravy, an egg, cheese, onions and a bunch of other random things and OMG it was delicious. This place has some variation of Poutine for everyone and the prices are pretty reasonably. Oh, and I believe they are open 24 hours a day."}
{"text":"Amazing poutine! I picked some up to-go before heading to the airport. It was quite busy during lunch time and took abiut 15-20 minutes for my order to be ready. I got the filet mignon poutine (regular size). The regular size is actually a big portion and the poutine itself, just devine. Seriously, I wouldn't eat poutine anywhere else in Montreal. Better to have the best than to have mediocre. I had mediocre poutine the night before because Poutineville was out of the way, but I'm so glad I had the chance pick some up before leaving Montreal."}
{"text":"Definitely a must-try if you are visiting Montreal. Extremely welcoming and friendly staff who make you feel right at home. Delicious poutine, generous portions, and fantastic prices. You can customize your poutine in any way you want, which is such a beautiful thing."}
{"text":"This place was fabulous. The waiter was incredibly helpful about helping me find gluten-free and dairy-free stuff, and it turns out that wasn't hard to do. They even have vegan cheese (though it's not listed on the menu and you have to ask). The poutine was incredibly delicious -- makes me wish I could live in Toronto."}
{"text":"I went to this place because it had consistently great reviews and left...somewhat disappointed. The ambiance was great. However, the poutine (which was obviously what I came for) was underwhelming. I got the smashed potatoes with cheese curds, braised beef, and gravy. It seemed like a safe choice, and it was okay for the most part. The biggest crime here was that the poutine was barely lukewarm. I want my poutine to be scalding hot with those cheese curds melting in my mouth. This was not the case here, and it was somewhat disappointing."}
{"text":"First dining experience on our trip to Montreal. Came in at around 8pm, windows open, nice breeze, the place was full but not packed.

The menu is really interesting, you could easily build yourself a $50 bowl of poutine if you wanted to, with all of the topping choices. The fries alone were awesome, I loved the original poutine, great flavors and nice gravy. We also ordered the 911 spicy gravy with and egg, cheese and onions, that too was awesome. 

Nice selection of local beers, the service was great, everyone was really friendly and they have menus in French and English! They also close late."}
{"text":"Sorry but this is one of the worst poutine I have ever had, even Harvey's poutines beats this place, first off came here on a Friday night with no one here,  the patio is located in the back alley with barely any light and flies everywhere, we moved back in, simply menu with a build ur own poutine, my complaints, the fries were soggy as hell it was gross, the brisket tasted bland with no flavor, service was good here but the food just sucks, go across to smokes poutine"}
{"text":"Best poutine I have had in Montreal so far! I prefer this place over la banquise  as it is much cleaner and there's no line up! Also because I absolutely love their house fries! 
Oh and did I mention the best sangria?! Lychee sangria ! So good"}
{"text":"First time visiting Canada and definitely had to try poutine! My boyfriend and I enjoyed the idea of making our own personalized plates and each got our own. I didn't realize how big their smallest portion was and I ended up eating half my plate. Maybe they should offer a snack option for those not extremely hungry but want to nibble on something?

But overall, a great experience and atmosphere here. Waitresses are kind and offered suggestions on local beers which were delightful. Next I'm here though, I'll split a plate with someone."}
{"text":"Amazing poutine! definitely a place to go.
If you're a big group you should try the heart attack/crise cardiaque poutine it's huge and tastes good.
Good place to customize your poutine."}
{"text":"I am not really a fan of places with waits.  This place was ranked pretty highly in Trip Advisor, so we headed there on a late sunday night, because it was open.  But there was a 20 minute wait when we arrived and we considered going somewhere else- but no where nearby was open.  Long story short, it was FANTASTIC.  Worth it.  Absolutely worth the wait and the food was amazing.  I had the basic poutine and couldn't finish it.  Great beer selection.  Great price too.  Wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Excellent service. La grande poutine avec patate douce et viande braisée est succulante ! Reste ouvert très tard. Je recommande!"}
{"text":"The newest poutine place in Toronto.  I saw a ton of Instagram photos of Poutineville in Montreal citing that it was the best poutine place.  I got so excited when I realized that they were opening one in Toronto.  I just had to try it. Poutineville is close to St. George subway and on a small street, so I think it qualifies as a hidden gem.

There's a set menu of poutine as well as the make-your-own.  I couldn't resist making my own!  They also have a full bar so you can have a nice beer with poutine, which may be perfect for some.  I had gingerale with mine because I was in a bit of a weird mood.  The poutine was delicious, even though we realized more than half way through that we didn't get the pulled pork.  We brought it up with the waiter, and the restaurant owner came by and apologized.

They took the charge off our bill, and added the pulled pork to my leftovers.  Mmmm the poutine still tasted good the next day, which is surprising because it's not something that is usually eaten as leftovers.  I think the secret is in the cut of the fries.  I had these house special cut fries that were kind of like small wedges, that were a little crushed and then fried.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great experience for my first poutine! The waiter was super nice, friendly, and helpful to me figuring out what to order. I ended up getting the Farmer's Delight, and it was amazing!! A giant portion size too - I was able to take some home for leftovers - can't complain about that!

Love that this place has both specialty recommendations, as well as a \"build your own\" set up with a mark-able menu worksheet - would make customizing very easy!

Good times, would recommend!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night and it was busy but not packed.

I got some cheese sticks for appetizers. They were a bit on the spicy side which I liked. There's a nice crunch to it and the inside was very cheesy indeed. For $6, it wasn't bad.

I got the Montrealer as my main because I wanted the deep fried pickle. The deep fried pickle was very crunchy. The poutine itself had a lot of meat to it but it was overly salty. For $12, it was a pretty big portion.

We also ordered two desserts to share. They were both chocolate and both overly sweet. I have a sweet tooth so I don't mind it but it was almost unbearable for me. Both desserts were left unfinished.

Overall, my experience here was decent. I won't be rushing back but I did enjoyed my experience here."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Toronto, so of course we needed to try proper poutine. 

We certainly found it here! Tons of different options to suit every taste and every diet (except for low carb, of course). Vegetarians, rejoice! We can eat most stuff here beyond the meat section, including the original, red wine, and pepper gravies. The only vegan option is original gravy (better than most vegan gravies, but dull by comparison) and Daiya.

I'd highly recommend sticking with their crushed potatoes when designing your dream poutine. The texture is incredible, and stands up well to a liberal application of gravy. Their sweet potato fries seemed too soft and got soggy quickly, but were still delicious with the au poivre gravy. 

Minus one star because sometimes the fries can be a bit soggy, and the original gravy is kind of bland. 

Next time, I would get the crushed potatoes, curds, and a mix of the red wine and pepper sauces."}
{"text":"We went to Poutineville because the name was really cool. We had just. Even on the train for 12 hours and needed some of Canada's world-famous POUTINE!

I loved how in Montreal they speak both English and French to try to see which language you will choose - of course being from Louisiana, English is my main language.

The Poutine here was quite delicious and we split two different types. I'm not sure if Poutine should be your only meal, but for us, that is what we did.

I mean how can you go wrong with fries, curds, and toppings?"}
{"text":"excellent service-- server spoke english and french and also gave us some tips on places to see and visit. the owner made sure we were happy with our food choices and overall was entertaining and very friendly. 

food- ask for the specials and definitely go for the house potatoes vs usual french fries. you can order the original poutine or you can build  and customize your own, which is a lot of fun!

they also serve alcohol here which is a bonus. 

ambiance is fun and very trendy. parking is easy to find."}
{"text":"It was good.  Had a vegetarian poutine and i didnt get disappointed.  Yummmmmmy.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Les poutines n'ont rien de spéciales. Pas plus bonnes que la plupart des poutines qu'on peut s'acheter à Montréal. Durant ma visite le serveur a renversé de la sauce sur mes pantalons blancs sans s'excuser et la tâche n'est jamais parti même après un lavage."}
{"text":"First time Poutine-er over here!  Let me explain why they get 4 stars:

Service - 3 stars - it wasn't the servers fault as he was very friendly, welcoming and gave great advice for nightlife; however, he was handling way too many tables. Management needs to add a server - yes it's good to be busy, but when the server doesn't have time to bring the check because he needs to take the other 6 tables orders - not okay.

Food - 5 stars - before I came here, I heard the description of Poutine and thought it sounded disgusting; however, I was told that I must try it. Well, poutineville made me realize that it is actually amazing/delicious. I'd recommends beginners to start with the classic Poutine. I tried the blue cheese one and thought it was too much but the classic was just right!"}
{"text":"Just heavenly! By far the best Poutine I've had in Montreal. What made our experience here exceptional was the fantastic customer service. We felt right at home even though the place was packed and we were in a rush. Their menu has something fir everyone. I highly recommend the place. Perfect stop on a cold day."}
{"text":"Poutineville is a serious operation. These guys definitely care about their poutine ingredients. Starting with the fries, their crushed potatoes are amazing, the sweet potato fries are perfect as well. The cheese curds are truly squeaky and attention is made that they don't melt in the gravy. In few words you can experience quality classical poutine in Poutineville. Besides that you can make your own poutine, which the patrons seem to be excited about. In addition to the standard menu you will be given sheet with all the ingredients you can pick and concoct your meal. I'm generally happy to have that option, but this is also a risky approach towards your food,  you may end up mixing ingredients you love separately that just don't fit together. This was the experience of my first visit and since then I have learned my lesson not to experiment too much.  I would definitely recommend to Montreal visitors from abroad to go with a standard combination from the menu if this is their first time trying the dish. Otherwise service is quick and efficient. The guys will feed you, make you pay your bill timely and rush the next customers in as sometimes Poutineville gets busy. Have fun!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out for Poutine week. My boyfriend and I spilt 2 different poutine's... the \"specialty poutine\" of the week with braised beef, red wine sauce, cheese curds and mozarella; it was wonderful!! super tasty! We also took \"le montrealais\" which had smoked meat, suisse cheese grantine, mushrooms and a fried pickle... all i can say is FOOD-GASM!!! omg wonderful. Every bite was worth every single calorie.. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"WHAT HAPPENED??????
I went there for a late night (or VERY early morning poutine). Ordered the Montrealais (like I had done the previous time and thought I had died and gone to heaven) and was BEYOND disappointed... it makes me sad just thinking about how sad I was when I was eating the sad poutine.....
The fries were ice cold, I think they forgot our gravy (we had ZERO gravy in our takeout dish) and the cheese wasn't melted at all. It was a hard lump of goop. My deep fried pickle was a soggy limp mess. 
I'm sad... Very sad.... :(
Maybe they had a bad night?"}
{"text":"This place came up in many reviews both here at yelp and others.  The propaganda would tell you that this is a food staple of those in Montreal. I'm not sure if that's true or if it's mostly for visitors but I diverged from my normal healthy eating to give this a try.  Boy what a treat!  Nice tender fried potatoes, gravy, and chunks of cheese mixed it.  I sorta behaved myself and ate half and took half home. 

Service was excellent, accommodating and friendly.  Worth the metro ride and walk from the hotel so I was very happy in the end!"}
{"text":"Coming to Montreal, home of poutine, it was a definite must eat. After spending the morning shriving aka sight seeing in the Canadian freezing weather, we decided to stop by poutineville to pile on some body fat to battle the cold. 

We arrived right before the lunch rush but this place already seemed a bit understaffed- One man and one woman. The woman seated us right by the door where the wind was blowing in non stop by dropping the utensil sets onto the table. Before we had a chance to move, she was already gone. The place was still pretty empty then so it was very easy for us to just move around, not quite sure why she gave us such crappy table in the first place. 

Two of us went with the create your own poutine after doing the math and realized it would cost more to go with their combo specials. We made the mistake of going when we were all really hungry.  Even after asking for the waiter to show us an example of large size, we still made the mistake of ordering one for each of us. When our orders came out, we knew we are probably eating the same poutine for dinner and breakfast tomorrow. It would had been smarter if all 3 of us just shared 1 large. 

So onto he poutine! I went with the sampler where I swap the crushed potato for more sweet potato fries ($2 extra) and asked for guacamole on the side ($1.75). The size of my order was relatively small compared to equally priced large. However I was happy to be able to sample two different types of gravies. I especially enjoyed the one with the red wine gravy. The pepper gravy had an Asian kick to it - still very tasty just not as big of a fan. 

My fiancé's brother went with nacho cheese, cheese curds, hot dogs and meat sauce. It tasted pretty much like chili cheese fries with random pieces of hot dog and cheese curds. My fiancé went all out with his - pepperoni, ground beef, corn dog, gravy, cheddar cheese, cheese curd. I wasn't a big fan of his gravy and he def went way overboard with the toppings. After an hr, he still barely made a dent in his order. 

The service was okay with the lack of staffing. The waitress spoke broken English and seemed a little pushy and overwhelmed initially. But then I realized that's just how she is.. \"Friendly\" - aka the French tough love way . Overall it satisfied my poutine craving for the year."}
{"text":"PoutineVille is one of my favourite restaurants in Montreal (I can expand that range to all of Canada now that they have a Toronto location as well ;-) ).

I highly recommend the \"patates écrasées\" (which they translate as \"crushed potatoes\" but I've always thought sounded better as \"smashed potatoes\", not that I'm taking credit - that was actually put forward by a review in the now-defunct Montreal Mirror).  Since I really prefer sweet potatoes, that's what I often order nowadays, also delectable.

You should definitely try the red wine sauce, and feel free to ask for a sampler of their different sauces.  All sauces except the meat sauce are vegetarian.

The pictures I took were at this location, but the review applies to the Beaubien restaurant as well.  I'll be seeing you guys again soon to get my fix :-)."}
{"text":"Other than having multiple options and a build your own poutine, it's very ordinary poutine. Not the mindblowing experience everyone raves about.  La Banquise still owns."}
{"text":"This place was SO good.  We were visiting the city and had never tried poutine.  Based on other reviews, we decided that this was the place to try it.

They offer kids meals and our children had fun drawing on the back of the paper menus with pencils provided.

You must try the house special \"The Poutineville\".  Tender braised (not fatty) beef, that awesome wine gravy, cheese curds over their \"crushed\" potatoes (which were like homefries instead of fries).

Service was super friendly.  The staff chit-chatted with our kids about favorite hockey teams and even expedited our food and bill when they learned we were headed to the Canadiens game that night.

If we lived nearby, we'd have so much fun creating custom poutine here!"}
{"text":"Un resto de poutine avec de la classe. Un grand choix de poutines, on peut choisir la patate, la sauce, le fromage et d'autres trucs qu'on peut ajouter. C'est très bon et ça remplit bien le bedon. A essayer les poutines avec patates douces ou les patates écrasées."}
{"text":"Attentive service, quick, great setting and the food was delicious. It was our first poutine experience and we were not disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Poutineville for ages, and constantly put it off until my decisive friends made the move for me. First off, I feel I didn't do Poutineville justice. I think this is the place you go to when you're already very clear about what poutine is, how you like yours, what you want it to taste like. You should go there and think \"I'mnna have a weird poutine\", and be firm in your resolve.

I didn't do that. I half-assedly odered the sampler: one small sweet potato fries/ pepper sauce and one small crushed potato fries with wine sauce. My friends on the other hand went all out with extra pogos and all-veggie and whatnot. So I recommend the sweet potatoes but, with wine sauce. The pepper sauce is much too salty actually and kills it all. I thought the cheese lacked in squeakiness. The bowls went cold quickly. It was all very okay. BUT, if you get funky with your order, then your meal becomes a perpetual hide-and-seek and things are wonderful! So you do that. 
And don't throw away a good poutine, they do doggy-bags.."}
{"text":"We were expecting to find foie gras poutine on the menu but it wasn't. The ambiance was very dirty and cheap feeling and the fries were of poor quality. It was very filling and good food if you are drunk but I will probably not go back there."}
{"text":"This Is THEE SPOT for Poutine while in Montreal. friendly service with an extensive Menu."}
{"text":"The large poutine was so large that two of us couldn't finish it. I also regretted ordering the house special smashed fried potato rather than true fries. That said this was a close second to La Banquise where the main deciding factor was that the curds at La Banquise were a bit fresher. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Large selection of poutines and ingredients to choose from. The place itself is a bit small."}
{"text":"I came here the first time I visited Montreal and am back a second time with my family! The service was friendly and fast, and the small portion is already quite large. My family of four shared three small poutines.

The hand crushed potatoes are really good. We created our own poutine and added the red wine sauce. Definitely try this sauce! The pulled pork poutine was also good, but the julienne fries got really soggy really quickly since they were so thin. The Montrealer had smoked meat, one fried pickle, and Swiss cheese. It was good, but the least favorite of the three.

In general, this is a great place to go if you've never had poutine before."}
{"text":"I visited this place with my best friend when we went to Montreal. We arrived early for lunch when the placed just opened for the day.

It was a no brainer that my best friend and I were not from Montreal. Our server patiently explained how the menu works - you can select a poutine from the \"pre designed\" list, or you can create your own. Amazing concept and I have to admit, it was fun picking your own ingredients for the poutine.

Food took a while to come, but the portion was massive. I was only able to finish 60% of it.

It was loaded with all the goodness I wanted in my poutine, but I felt like there was something special/unique missing in the food for me to come back again."}
{"text":"I prefer the sauce at La Banquise, but this place is a VERY close 2nd place. And it's not too far away (by car) from my first choice, so it's a perfect backup plan, whenever there's too big of a lineup at  #1. The potatoes are delicious btw. I chose pepperoni and pogo with regular curded cheese.

Bilingual and very friendly service. LOVE IT!

Ambience is very clean, chill, and not as rush-rush/noisy as La Banquise. As well, the music...awesome 70's and 80's funk (a la Earth Wind and Fire and Chaka Khan). This place is a MUST! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm an odd québecoise, I need to reaaallllyy crave poutine to eat it. I don't just randomly eat it, you see? So when I do want to fall down the poutine-hole, this is where I come.

No matter what ingredients you pick, it's amazing, although I do think the smashed potatoes are vastly superior. Super efficient service and fair choice of alcohol to make things interesting. The portions are humongous so if you're not the kind of animal who enjoys leftover poutine, go for the small."}
{"text":"J'étais plutôt dubitatif par rapport au concept...  La poutine est un plat que tant de restaurateurs ont voulu réinventer, et avec si peu de succès, en général...  Mais je crois que ce restaurant a réussi à innover tout en respectant le met de base (évidemment, ça dépend de comment vous bâtissez votre poutine...).  La sélection de frites est intéressante (j'ai particulièrement apprécié les écrasées), elles sont à point, croustillantes comme il se doit.  Le choix de sauce est intéressant, mais pourrait selon moi être bonifié (je ne vois vraiment pas quelle sauce offerte irait avec le fromage de chèvre, par exemple).  La sauce \"911\" tout en restant proche de la sauce originale, est juste bien balancée au niveau épices, comme un bon pad thai: les premières bouchées ; un peu de chaleur à peine, mais vous commencez à suer pour de bon vers la moitiée du plat!  
L'endroit lui-même fait très \"états-unien\".  Musique laissant à désirer et un peu trop forte. Télés branchées sur le canal du sport.  Le tout dans un endroit qui se veut plutôt classe... Bizarre, comme si à défaut de se trouver une âme, on avait été se la magasiner dans un wallmart, en pièces détachées et sans idée d'ensemble...  
Service correct, avec quelques ratés notables, mais pour lesquels nous avons eu droit à de sincères excuses et même un verre de bière, on peut donc dire qu'on y prend soin de la clientèle...  Un plus pour eux.

En bref, un bon endroit à découvrir si vous voulez une bonne poutine et si vous vous sentez créatifs.  J'y retournerai, ne serait-ce que pour voir comment je peux intégrer le fromage bleu à notre met national..."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Great first-time experience eating gourmet poutine. It's just not something I would want to eat again and again. 

Long line out the door, but we probably waited 30 mins for a party of 2. We got a spot in the back of the restaurant at the bar, so some flexibility with where you'll sit will help secure a seat faster.

We had the Poutineville with braised beef, wine sauce, mozzarella, and cheese curds and the Montrealer with smoked meat, mushrooms, cheese, poutine sauce, and a fried pickle. I expected to like the Poutineville better, because I'm a big fan of braised beef in wine sauce, and I did not think I would like smoked meat. However, the Poutineville wasn't salty enough for me. It turned out to be a lot less flavorful than the saltier and seasoned smoked meat on the Montrealer. Also, just get the smaller of the two size options. There is no need to get the bigger one, because you'll either get full or you will feel so crappy about yourself that you will stop eating. 

I think what makes Poutineville different from other places like La Banquoise are the gourmet toppings it offers. Additionally, Poutineville has a whole a la carte make-it-youself menu where you can choose exactly which toppings you want on your poutine. You even have different options for the potato- fries or smashed potatoes. It seems like the smashed potatoes is the more popular version here. 

It was also our first time trying Canadian beer. The St. Ambroise cream ale is really good. My bf was freaking out at first because they weren't filling the glass as you normally would with a beer to avoid getting too much head. But be patient- this is to build up a beautiful head of cream mousse."}
{"text":"How the hell is Montreal not a huge mess of overweight gravy, cheese curd, filled French Canadians?! 

The portions here are crazy (and I'm from America)."}
{"text":"Finally in Montreal, what was the first thing to do ? Eating a Poutine of course.

Pretty hard for me to judge it so far cause I need way more of them to really know what to expect from this delicious gift from the gods.

I checked a bit on internet to know where the best poutines might be in town, and found this place, I must say I wasn't disappointed !

I had the classic from Poutineville with \"boeuf braisé\" 

My reaction when it arrived in front of me : DAYUUUUUM

My reaction when I tasted it : DAYUUUUUUUUUUUM

that's pretty much it, I had trouble finishing since it was pretty huge (of course I had the large one)


Many different poutines to try, from the classic one, the spicy, many different cheeses, sorts of fries and so on, you can make it yourself and add everything you want, good idea, the possibilities are endless !


5 stars maybe ? I'll check some other ones, but will definitely try this place again !

Montreal will make me obese, round one"}
{"text":"I went to poutineville many times for various items on the menu. I have to say, there's a poutine for everyone, and the rest will be bad. I tried sampling as many of their food (+1 for their varied menu). However, 90% of the time I was disappointed.

I tried the regular, the specials, etc. But so far I only liked a few. Couple with the fact that it's so far away from everything else, I don't think I'm going back. It was a one time experience, which at the end was still worth it."}
{"text":"This place has a great concept: Customizable poutine. Each person can order their own dish (that you will not be able to finish, mind you) cooked exactly the way they want it. You can have classic poutine with plain fries, gravy, and cheese curds; or change it up. I got sweet potato fries (delicious) with gravy, cheese curds, and sautéed mushrooms. Everyone's food was great and the price was reasonable. We walked right in on a Saturday afternoon. The only thing I would change would be the decor--it felt very dive-y, but the food isn't. Sprucing it up slightly would take this place to 5 stars."}
{"text":"We managed to sneak in a meal between brunch and dinner. Brunner? Given our tight schedule, this was going to be our only chance to have poutine.  Poutineville ended up being a wise choice.

We only tried a small \"la poutineville\". Don't let the size fool you though. This is still a very hearty dish that was good enough for the two of us. This poutine, I am guessing, is the original version. It was a pretty simple dish with braised beef, mozzarella cheese and potatoes and red wine sauce. I was floored by how good the flavors and textures were - especially the potatoes which had an amazing crispiness on the outside and softness inside. You could just serve me those potatoes in that beefy flavor and I'd be a happy customer.

Poutineville has a quirky set up and were playing 70s disco the whole time we were there. The waitstaff were much older than what I usually see at restaurants, but they looked like they partied it up in the 70s. It seemed like a place that was stuck in that era, which was kind of funny and charming in its own way.

They had many different kinds of poutine including a make-your-own option but since it was my first time, I wanted to try the original. Is this the standard for good poutine? I don't know but I sure as hell would be okay if it was."}
{"text":"Certains ne jurent que par la Banquise, moi j'ai jeté mon dévolu sur Poutineville.
D'abord découvert par hasard en me promenant sur Ontario, c'est ce gros P sur fond rouge qui m'a attiré.
Depuis c'est devenu mon repaire à poutines, et toute la carte y est passée.
Clairement, Poutineville fait les meilleures de la ville : des ingrédients frais et de qualité, une garniture généreuse, et surtout leur façon originale de préparer les frites, façon \"patates écrasées\" qui apportent un vrai plus (ne vous fiez pas au nom peu attirant, ça ne signifie pas que le cuisinier les prémâche pour vous).
Après un passage ici, on ne voit plus les poutines d'un même oeil : non la poutine n'est pas (uniquement) un plat bien gras et bien lourd qu'on ingurgite après une soirée, mais peut être un vrai plat gastronomique. 
Je ne trouve absolument rien à redire sur aucune poutine de la carte. Mais mes deux coups de coeurs sont dédiés aux spécialités de la maison :
- la Poutineville : évidemment quand un plat porte le nom du restaurant on s'attend à quelque chose de maîtrisé et original. Bingo ici, voyez plutôt : les patates écrasées bien sûr, mélange de fromages, le tout accompagné de boeuf effiloché et d'une sauce au vin rouge...Une \"poutine boeuf bourguignon\", pari risqué mais pari réussi : incroyable. Si vous venez pour la première fois c'est un passage obligé, vous DEVEZ prendre une Poutineville. Et la grande. Car la petite ne vous suffira pas. La grande non plus d'ailleurs. Une fois goûtée, toutes les autres poutines vous sembleront bien fades.
- la crise cardiaque : 15 livres de poutine ! Vous en rêviez ? Poutineville l'a fait ! Certains ont le courage de la commander pour eux tout seul (des concours sont organisés d'ailleurs, il y a quelques vidéos sur Youtube), le faible que je suis l'a partagée avec 4 autres amis \"moyens\" mangeurs. Une bonne alternative économique et fun !

Sinon pour les personnes très difficiles : à vos crayons ! Vous pouvez composer votre propre poutine qui portera votre nom, ingrédient par ingrédient. Jusqu'au choix du fromage et des patates (le bon moment pour s'essayer à une poutine à base de patates douces !). Mais elle vous reviendra un peu plus chère qu'une poutine de la carte bien sûr.

Pour information et aussi étonnant que cela puisse paraître, Poutineville ne fait pas que des poutines, eh oui ! Assiettes, Club sandwiches, burgers,...Mais aller chez Poutineville pour prendre autre chose qu'une poutine, c'est quand même une drôle d'idée.

L'ambiance est décontractée le midi, plus \"traditionnelle\" le soir. Pensez à réserver, les tables sont peu nombreuses et Poutineville a son petit succès...Les serveuses sont quant à elles adorables (avec le petit accent étranger bien cute) et le temps d'attente vraiment raisonnable."}
{"text":"If you're going to be eating poutine, come here. The potatoes were crispy and already bite sized, making them easy to eat. The gravy / sauce was perfectly balanced. The proteins and other toppings scattered all over were like treats to find. I think the house poutine was my favorite."}
{"text":"We split the regular cut poutine with cheese curds, bacon, and gravy. I didn't have a huge portion, but the bites that I had were good. They have a wide arrange of toppings which lets you customize your poutine exactly as you'd like. They also have a wide selection of beer which makes it a nice late night spot."}
{"text":"Quelque peu déçu de ma dernière visite chez Poutineville. J'ai choisi de confectionner moi-même ma propre poutine à l'aide de la petite fiche distribuée à chaque client. Voici les raisons de ma déception : Les frites me semblaient un peu sèches. Pour un resto à poutine, c'est un problème majeur. J'ai choisi la sauce au vin et elle ne goutait presque rien. D'ailleurs, j'ai lu ce même reproche au sujet de la sauce dans d'autres critiques. J'ai opté pour un supplément de feta et le cuisinier avait chichement dispersé quelques cubes de ce fromage à travers les frites. 

Oui, le principe de confectionner la poutine de son goût est intéressant. C'est d'ailleurs ce qui distingue Poutineville de bien d'autres poutineries de quartier. Le problème : la facture risque d'être élevée puisque les extra sont chargés à la pièce. Mon exemple ce soir-là, pour une poutine format régulier avec extra de feta, ognons, champignon et sauve au vin, le montant de la facture remontait à 22 $ avec un verre de vin rouge. Pourboire non inclus. Incluant le service, j'ai déboursé 25$. Franchement, pour un repas à la poutine avec un p'tit verre de rouge, c'est cher payé. Je vous conseille aussi d'éviter la place les vendredi soir, car la file d'attente peut s'étirer le long du trottoir et en décourager plusieurs. 

Pour le reste, Poutineville demeure quand même une bonne place pour déguster ce mets typiquement québécois, toutefois sans être LA place à poutine de Montréal."}
{"text":"My family went on a Monday for lunch and it was pretty quiet. We are not experts on poutine, but we had to try it during our trip in Montreal, and we loved it ! Thankfully we aren't from the area because we definitely don't need the calories. 

The portions are very generous - I think if you're not too hungry, 2 people could even share the regular. My brother finished one on his own but I needed some help near the end :) The server was very kind and answered all of our touristy questions. He spoke English and French. They have outdoor seating with shade which was perfect on a summer day. 

From the Menu:

They have a make-your-own option for Poutine toppings, but my family isn't expert at Poutine so we decided to go with the ready menu items. 

My parents shared a large Zeus Poutine. This was my favorite - the gyro in the poutine was so yummy. Even between the two of them this was a LOT of food! The portions are large so come hungry or beware :) this comes over hand crushed potatoes which are delicious - I would say they're somewhere between French Fries and Home Fries. 

I had the Farmers Poutine, which I enjoyed because it didn't have too many ingredients compared to other options, and I didn't have too much of an appetite. 

My brother had the Hangover Poutine, which was a sensory overload (in a good way) and was very tasty. It was pretty spicy because of the hot sauce, so don't order this if you can't handle spicy."}
{"text":"Oh. my. god. I am craving this right now as I write this review. As my extent of knowledge about Canada goes (which is very little), nothing is more Canadian than poutine, right?? I definitely had to try this place out before I left Canada. 

Even though Poutineville was only half a mile away from our hotel, I was seriously considering if it was worth it having to walk 10 minutes in a snow storm to eat here. I may have gotten a little bit sick, but all I have to say is that I have no regrets. I was never ever a fan of carbs, of cheese, or anything that this place would stand for, but somehow, Poutineville converted me. 

I opted for the make-your-own-poutine menu, since I was all about having it my own way. It starts at 8-9 dollars, and you work your way up depending on how much stuff you decide to put in your poutine. From what I can recall, I added mushrooms, hot dog, bell peppers, gravy, runny egg, and some other options that I don't even remember. I ended up with about 10 additional items on top, which totaled up to about $19 just for that one dish. That sounds like a lot, but when the dish was served to us, it all made sense; it was huge!  It was like 2 days worth of food for me and my boyfriend, no way I would be able to finish that in one sitting. After eating through 1/4 of it, we decided to pack it up and enjoy it later.

I wish I was able to explain how good my customized poutine was. Yeah the flavors didn't really match, but I devoured it nevertheless. I especially enjoyed the cheese curds, and I'm not even a fan of cheese. The service was quick and the drink selection was adequate. If I ever find myself in Montreal again, you can almost guarantee that this will be the first place I will stop by at."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Poutine - the food was tasty, and came out really fast! Definitely recommend the house smashed potatoes over the fries. We tried the Poutineville and the Montealer; we preferred the Poutineville, but both were good. Service was excellent. If you're looking for a hearty meal, definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"This is my favourite venue of the Poutinevilles - not that the others are bad, I just like this one.

Unlike most poutine places in Montreal (and the province of Quebec in general), Poutineville is actually a classy affair. Nothing too fancy, but more fancy than your average pile-of-chips-covered-in-gravy-and-cheese place.

The amount of toppings you can choose is staggering, and I've still only scratched the surface of what can had. No matter what I've ordered, it's been good - they use good ingredients for everything. Admittedly, some of my choices have been better than others, but that's more my fault than the restaurant's. Definitely try the sweet potato fries, or the red wine sauce if you can.

It's also not too far up the road from Le Cheval Blanc, which is a good place to get a tasty beer before and/or after a poutine."}
{"text":"\"Gravy and fries . . . I guess\" 

Since everyone in the States always say that you HAVE to eat a Poutineville when you are in Montreal, I checked it out. Actually, this was my second time here.

Sorry go against many of the reviews here but I just do not get the hype around the place. Do not get me wrong the staff and the service are GREAT and the prices are moderate but I really do not see the need to wait in a long ling for gravy and fries. 

The attractive feature of the place is that you can create your own poutines with various combinations of potatos, meats, cheeses, veggies (who has time for those?), and sauces. I would recommend thinking outside of the box and go with the tomato sauce. Plus, you can select a small or large size. I would go with the small unless you are in severe starvation mode. Also, if you are in super starvation mode, one can get the Heart Attack poutine, which weights 15 pounds!!!! Tres grosse (a feable attempt writing in french). Wait is poutine masculine or feminine? 

Actually, I forget what I put in my poutine (aside from pulled pork and bacon) but it was decent. My only complaints are that the pulled pork was not as tender as I would have liked, the bacon pieces were really small, and the gravy sauce (this time I went for the \"traditional gravy rather than the tomato sauce) was a little bland. 

I would recommend going there just for the experience and to say that you have been there. I went this time because I was traveling with someone and it was his first time in Montreal. Oh, to avoid waiting in a long line try going in the afternoon around 1pm. Also, they have added Negroni's to the cocktail list. The barender (or manager) really wanted to make sure that the Negronis were made correctly, since they are new for this establishment."}
{"text":"Poutineville deserves its fame and its hundreds of positive reviews; it's THE poutine place in Montreal! With its numerous options and make-your-own-poutine formula, you can't go wrong! Although my husband and I have had to wait to be seated on a couple of occasions, busy nights evidently, the staff always is courteous, albeit their service could be more efficient and focused. 

I've read some reviewers complain about the drinks menu, implying no one should ever order wine or martinis with such a greasy and earthy meal; I will say that a glass of red or white wine with a poutine is a surprisingly attractive and delectable match. 

Of all the choices on the menu, I have found after a few visits that the red wine sauce accompanied with marinated eggplant make a great match for the adventurous poutine lover. Try it and see for yourself! 

I highly recommend Poutineville as one of Montreal' best comfort foods and city icons."}
{"text":"Very good Poutine! The fries were nice and crispy. The ingredients tasty.  We were visiting and tried another Poutine place, but it couldn't even compare to this place. This place was so much  more tasty!"}
{"text":"I found this place because I was visiting Canada and had never had poutine before and I wanted something anyone could try regardless of the dietary restrictions in the group I was with. This establishment was a build your own poutine place so it was perfect for my needs. Also it was exactly what I expected it to be. Everything was balanced and very filling. My first experience with poutine is one that I'll probably enjoy telling others about thanks to poutineville. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to either try poutine for the first time or to get a new variation of the poutine dish that they  already love"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best poutine joints I've ever been to. I was actually contemplating on going to another poutinerie and after reading a few reviews here on Yelp, I opted to come here, even though this was the farthest poutinerie from my hotel room. But with a short subway ride and a 5 minute walk from the station, the wait was definitely worth it.

The poutine was so good, I came back again the next night. The server remembered me from the night before and gave me a super cool tour of the business and the history around the buildings in the same area. Steve was a pretty cool dude.

But the poutine was just so good, so filling. The regular size was just enough to fill you up. They also have the large size, but you would have to be hella crazy to go for something that big.

If you're in the Toronto area, I would recommend coming here for your poutine experience. They also have some draft specials and the cream ale suited well with my poutine."}
{"text":"Love the poutine here. I've been to the Poutineville in Toronto and these guys are pretty much on par with the quality of the poutine and keeping me happy. Although this place is a lot busier.

These guys took care of me as soon as I walked in the door. I still love La Banquise, but I would still go to both at at least once every time I come to Montreal. I think there's a little bit more of a sophistication when coming here, where there's a lot more shenanigans at La Banquise.

And I like how you can basically choose whatever you want on your poutine with their simple check-in-the-box menu. Plenty of alcohol too. But I would probably skip their martinis. I wasn't a fan of that."}
{"text":"Don't bother looking at any of the other menu options. Get their \"spécialité de la maison\" (crushed potatoes, braised beef, red wine gravy). Seriously, just do it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Continuing on my hunt for the quality poutine spots in Montreal I had an opportunity to visit Poutineville last night with some friends.

The awesome:
- the order form that made me feel like I was taking an exam back in university, but seriously the variety of options and the \"design your own poutine\" thing was very cool (image: http://www.flickr.com/photos/infuzion_photography/5915972212/in/photostream)
- funky lamps, comfy booths and decor in the restaurant
- my friend Julie getting a super cool surprise from the owner (I won't spoil it in case Poutineville want to offer it again sometime) because she had tweeted about the restaurant earlier. I just LOVE that they have an active presence on social media - facebook and twitter. Way to connect! 

The poutine:
- I ordered the classic and it was good. I particularly loved the fries they used. The cheese (grains frais) wasn't my fave (I like it super squeaky) but combined with the super fries and poutine maison sauce, worked nicely.
- I tried a bit of Julie's order (onions, peppers, tomatoes and bacon) and it was yummy. 

Overall:
I see now why people rave about this place. It's definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Concept génial et surtout qui permet d'essayer la poutine avec des ingrédients un peu différents et peut-être plus aux goûts de chacun.

Un immanquable"}
{"text":"The poutine was average at best yet the burgers were good. Poor management though, the server had no idea if they had wi-fi, didn't serve condiments as requested AND they ran out of pickles???"}
{"text":"Delish!!  We wanted to try some Montreal comfort food, and this fit the bill perfectly.  Our waitress (maybe the owner as well, as she seemed to be in charge) was super friendly and gave us great ordering advice.  Our only complaint (and why we gave 4 stars instead of 5) is that we had to wait for nearly 45 minutes to be seated.  There is really no proper waiting area, so you have to just stand in the cold doorway.  We had called about 4 hours before we arrived to make reservations, but were told we couldn't make reservations for just 3 people, however we should be seated quickly anyway.  That clearly did not happen, but nevermind -- the wait was worth it because the poutine was really hot, fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"This place is a lovely addition to the neighborhood. The patates écrasées are especially noteworthy as a base for a novel poutine. The concept is brilliant in a town as poutine-obsessed as Montreal but the gravies are not necessarily up to snuff (although ostensibly all vegetarian save for the meat sauce). This said, the sheer variety of additions allows one to experiment to a degree that wouldn't be possible in a traditional poutine place. Service was great, the manager spoke to us, and the desserts (even though not made on site) were surprisingly good. All this in mind, a single large poutine can end up running you about 20 bucks in some cases. So it is a bit pricey, for what it is..."}
{"text":"Comme la plupart des gens je vais souvent à la banquise mais ce petit restaurant sur Ontario est un excellent choix également. Si vous souhaitez créer une poutine entièrement personnalisée Just go :) choisissez le type de frites, le ou les fromages que vous souhaitez, les condiments et magie: un vrai délice devant vos yeux! Service aussi toujours aimable, équipe jeune!"}
{"text":"The line is so very long and moves at a moderate place. 
It's a thing you should do on a late night after a night of drinks. 
Otherwise, there are a lot of other restaurants that you can get."}
{"text":"Delicious! Make your own poutine is divine! Of course you can get their house/traditional poutine if you don't like going out of the box. I had to take this to go unfortunately. It would have been nice to sit in and eat, but we were on a schedule.

When I opened my very large portion (which was the regular size), it smelled amazing~ And it also tasted so good. I made my own which had mozzarella cheese, bacon and onions on it with their house gravy. I think I may have add another thing, but I don't remember. 

If I visit Montreal again, I would love to come again and this time eat-in."}
{"text":"As a first time visit to Montreal, poutine was at the top of our list to try. We checked out Poutineville for THE place for good poutine. There was a long line that led outside to the sidewalk, but it went by quick. 

We got the Sampler of 2 poutines: crushed potatoes + wine sauce, & sweet potatoes + pepper sauce, both w/ cheese curds. Also got The Montrealer: smoked meat, mushrooms, swiss cheese, poutine sauce, & fried pickle to top it. I love that it was drenched in gravy. Both greasy, cheesy, and delicious. Generous portion too. They also have free wifi! How could you go wrong? 

You also the option to customize your own poutine which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Unbelievably good. There was a line for lunch but it moved pretty fast.  Service friendly despite the crowd.  But it's the food.  Just crazy good.   We are already poutine lovers but the gravy, fried potato chunks, the brisket.  Couldn't believe I ate the whole thing but I did."}
{"text":"One of my favorite poutine's on my recent trip to Montreal, mostly because of their crispy smashed potatoes! My husband and I split the following:
- fried pickles: super tasty! crunchy, perfect breading to pickle ratio, good dipping sauce
- house special poutine: brased beef with wine sauce gravy- yummy crispy potatoes, squeaky cheese curds.....but a little too heavy on the gravy. heavy in terms of flavor and amount, but still yummy.

Relaxed, comfortable atmosphere. No wait on a Sunday night. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"IM JUST GOING TO SAY that I usually hate poutine but I came here for a social gathering and I really enjoyed the dish. Their poutine is super customizable so you can get all the things that you love on it.

Also, the staff is amaaaazingly friendly and chill. They also have a good beer selection and the atmosphere is great. 

It's hidden and I probably would never have stumbled upon it but I'm glad I did!"}
{"text":"As an American it's hard to rate poutine. But man, if I get poutine again, I want it from Poutineville.

The place is as casual as you can get- we hit it mid-day and got the lunch crowd- road workers, secretaries, real work a day people. A great sign that it wasn't going to be hoity-toity. 

The pencil and paper 'create your own poutine' is dangerous. They already allow you to get 4 cheeses (Grains Frais, Mozzarella, Swiss and Cheddar) and their house cut potatoes ((écrassées) complimentary.  Then you get to the add-ons and the list goes on and on... I added hot-dog slices.

It was the largest amount of Poutine that I had while in Montreal- the petite was huge. More than I could handle anyway. Each bite was loaded with goodness.

The price was super reasonable for the amount they give you! Worth a trip to one of their locations."}
{"text":"If you haven't try poutine, then you are completely missing out on one of the biggest Canadian's food staple. Here, they have many different kinds of poutine to choose from. I don't recommend hogging a plate to yourself because they are HUGE! 

They started us off by handing us a paper where we would check off what we want in our poutine. We had the near basic poutine with meat. You could go fancier and add more ingredients to the dish but like I mentioned earlier, the portion is big. We barely finished our meal and was completely satisfied afterwards.

Swing by for some awesome poutine!"}
{"text":"Really sweet place and yummy food and wonderful drinks. Waitress was very accommodating and helpful."}
{"text":"Poutineville lets you create your own personal poutine dish. There's choices of cheeses, vegetables, meats, sauces and more. Best poutine I've had and I definitely
recommend it.

My eyes are always bigger than my stomach so of course I ordered the larger portion which was exactly what they say, grande. So much food but so good. Go with the regular portion unless you're feeling adventurous."}
{"text":"The poutines were great and portion size is huge! I couldn't even have dinner after having this for lunch."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, this place was amazing.

Yes, there can be quite a wait to get in. Yes, the space can be super tight. All in all, though, the wait and cramped quarters were well worth it because the food was phenomenal.

Came here on a Saturday night and while the wait appeared to be daunting, we only had to wait about 20 or so minutes on the queue before we were seated. Once seated, we were able to choose from \"set\" poutine options or create our own concoctions. I opted to create my own poutine, which included their vegan gravy, jalapeno peppers, mushrooms, guacamole, a fried egg, and cheese curds (of course). I believe I had opted for their standard fries as well. My table and I also shared their house salad.

Holy crap, was my poutine delicious. Heavy, yes, but oh so delicious. The house salad was a great idea as it really helped with the heaviness of our meal. The marinated eggplants in the salad was phenomenal. Writing this review up gives me a slight pang in my heart as I am saddened by the fact that this delicious eatery is located so far away from me. 

Service also happened to be excellent. I mean, what more could you ask of an establishment, honestly? I would definitely come back here in a heartbeat if I were to ever return to Montreal and I would also highly recommend anybody and everybody to check this place out if you also happen to be in Montreal."}
{"text":"I love me some good poutine and being a pescetarian, it's always hard to find one that is meatless. Well this place here allows you to make your own and I got the classic poutine with a sunny side up egg on top. Needless to say, this hit the spot and was absolutely delicious. 

The service was great and the folks there were attentive. I'd definitely come back here again for sure."}
{"text":"What more needs to be said? Best poutine in town bar none. Service fast and friendly.  Soda served in cans and bottles instead that watered down crap too many joints try to serve you with.

This place is unique in the way you can either order preset templates of poutine off the menu or you can customize a poutine EXACTLY THE WAY YOU WANT IT.

Seriously, why isn't this done at more places?

If you never have had poutine here before... fix that."}
{"text":"I thought I was over poutine. I'd tried many of the best, a bunch of the worst and everything in between. I even thought I had tried Poutineville, but got it confused with a visit to Frites Alors last summer. I needed a spark or it was time to hang up my fork. To say I was pleasantly surprised, by a recent visit to Poutineville is an understatement. My desire for great poutine has been renewed. 

Their choices of specialty poutine toppings are extensive, and you can even build your own custom topped bowl of goodness. I found there were many interesting pre-designed choices on the regular menu. I came close to ordering their signature braised beef with red wine sauce, but opted for the Shepherd's pie creation (think I just missed home cooking). The well portioned plate was a satisfying mix of peas, carrots, corn, and seasoned beef on smashed potatoes, with gravy, chunky curds and a large spiral of ketchup. I'll have to try the other one next time. Perhaps I'll just take it out and eat while walking on a cool night to keep me warm.

Even the service stood out, on a very busy night the servers and bus people were in great spirits, and had smiles on from the beginning to end of the meal. Many locals and visitors seemed to be enjoying their poutine experiences alike. Good stuff Poutineville. Keep it up."}
{"text":"I want to give this 4 stars I really do but seeing that I can't give it 3.5 stars so I am giving it 4 stars. This was my first time here. It was a cold Tue night and I was in the mood for poutine. I was meeting a friend in the Bloor & Bathurst area and wanted to go to Smoke's but my friend recommended Poutineville. 

I loved the place! It was a sit in place and they have alcohol! We shared a large Poutineville, their  house specialty - hand crushed potatoes, with fresh cheese curds and mozzarella, topped with our slow home cooked braised beef and red wine gravy. 

The flavour was good. I like my poutine saucy and cheesy. The poutine was saucy but not enough cheese. My other pet peeve is that I like my poutine hot and this was warmish. I still enjoyed it. My friend and I also shard the dulce de leche cheesecake. It was good, not too sweet and the portion was perfect for 2 people. I hate huge desserts as I am not a dessert fan. 

I will be back. I loved the atmosphere and I can't wait to pair my poutine with a glass of wine."}
{"text":"We went the a few days ago, expecting a small restaurant. What we found surprised us a lot. It was buzzing with people and there was a line for seating.
The staff are nice and the seating is cozy albeit a little crowded. The food is good and a lot in amount. They offer regular and large plates of poutine; we ordered two regulars and it was too much for us. The large is for sharing and definitely costs less in comparison. Next time I am irdering the larhe one!
They have so many varieties of poutine, I didn't even know there could be so many different types of it. 
Also for people irdering the spicy bbq chicken poutine, beware; it is actually spicy."}
{"text":"Ça fait un petit bout que je suis allé là. Et en toute honnêteté, je prends toujours pour emporter ici. Premièrement j'ai une philosophie très poussée sur la poutine.
T'as 3 ingrédients. \"Don't fuck it up!\" !

Ça prend du fromage cheddar frais du jour et pas 1-2 semaines. Ce fromage n'est pas fait pour être réfrigéré ce que de nombreux restaurant font: Pas ici! Good job! 

La sauce: C'est un fond brun de volaille avec des épices, normalement épaissie avec de la fécule. C'est pas super compliqué à faire. En Gros une sauce maison s.v.p! Ici c'est pas mal ça. C'est p-e le seul point qui n'est pas parfait.

Les frites: Des frites maison! Une huile de cuisson propre et changée régulièrement, Cuisson à la bonne température. Blanchies gagnent quelque points! Ici tout es parfait. 

Poutineville comme La Banquise offrent une vaste quantité de de choix ou ce que j'appelle de \"poutine pimpé\" ; La grande différence c'est les choix incroyables chez poutineville.  Mon ami m'a convaincu de quitté la traque et de prendre des patates pilée frit. C'est vraiment délicieux. Et desfois quand je me sens un peu \"foufou\" je consomme une Poutine avec des morceaux pogo parce que...c'est juste décadent! C'est vraiment bon. 

Petite note, ils ont quelques locations je n'ai pas encore essayé celle sur Beaubien, To Be Continued!

Calculé un peu plus de 10$ mais moins que 20$"}
{"text":"Make your own Poutine galore!! I loved it! I went with my friends, and it was my first time eating Poutine. You can choose from the menu or you can make your own by checking boxes after boxes of the items you would like thrown on your plate of fries! It was delicious, the service was great, a ambiance chill, the bill right and the food delicious!"}
{"text":"When in Montreal, one must eat copious amounts of poutine. And what better place to go to than Poutineville! With the option of creating your very own poutine creation, this place could make anyone love the Canadian staple dish! 
I've been twice with friends and have had great meals each time. Once I created my own poutine featuring the hand crushed fries, pepper gravy, bacon, cheese curds + cheddar and ground beef. Um, yeah, it was a cheeseburger on top of fries and I loved it.
I've also tried the house poutine which has braised beef and wine sauce! 
My mouth is watering just thinking of them."}
{"text":"This was my first experience eating Poutine and it was amazing! Being able to put what I want on my own Poutine was a creative and fun idea. I put gravy, corn, egg, and BBQ Pulled Pork on smashed potatoes. We also ordered the Sangria to drink and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Probably the best poutine I have had till now , we had their house special poutine. The \"hangover cure \" was too exotic . 
Definitely will visit again !"}
{"text":"This place is by far the best place to go in Montreal for poutine.  I love how they offer you a selection of poutines and the chance to build your own."}
{"text":"Been in Montreal for 3 days now and this was not only our favorite and most filling meal, but it has been our cheapest as well. My wife got the classic and I made my own poutine and both came out with less than 10 minutes later. Service was on point and the poutine really hit the spot after walking around and site seeing all day. It was a nice hearty warm meal, paired with good beer and I definitely would go back. I'm sure there is other poutine in town that is as good or better but for a quick fix and custom menu, this is the spot to go to."}
{"text":"It's the best!!  A must do for tourists and locals. We had top notch service by Jenn.  Simply great - don't hesitate!!!"}
{"text":"It is one of the best poutines in Toronto! We ordered Montrealer and requested for chicken instead of beef at no additional charge. Nice to sit in the backyard patio during the summer. Definitely going there again!"}
{"text":"I have tried Le Bansque on my last trip. This time Poutineville ranked the same. Decided to trial the one in The Village - cool open concept with windows wide open to give a patio feel. Very busy not matter the day or hour and open late. We were sat down very quickly and service was good. Ask for the English menu if French is not your first language . Drinks were good and the Poutine amazing. Can choose type of fries right down to type of toppings eg meat, veggies and even cheese! Large portion is huge and probably shareable. My friend and I got the large as was reasonably price but couldn't finish it!!  We each got one to trial different meats and toppings. I got chicken - she got meat and there was endless amounts of both. I suggest beef over chicken and also the brisket or smoked meat! 
Loud and busy. Tables are close together so expect to be friendly with your elbows and neighbors :)! I'd definitely go back. The environment did feel very restaurant like and definitely not fast food!"}
{"text":"Je dois dire que je ne fais malheureusement pas partie des nombreux amateurs de ce resto. La poutine est correcte, mais je ne ferais pas de détour pour m'y rendre. Le concept de faire sa poutine sur mesure est intéressant, mais ça ne m'a pas épatée (peut-être est-ce simplement moi qui a fait de mauvais choix!). Je serais prête à laisser une seconde à l'endroit si quelqu'un me le demande!"}
{"text":"La meilleure poutine du monde se trouve probablement à Poutineville ! Je prend à chaque fois la poutine avec le fromage sans produit laitier et c'est excellent. La poutine est un véritable délice et, bien qu'étant un plat très bourratif, ce n'est absolument pas écoeurant ici (contrairement à d'autres poutines). Bref, quand on vient au Canada, il faut manger de la poutine et surtout la manger à Poutineville !"}
{"text":"Love it!

I got the traditional with crushed potatoes, regular everything and I added mushrooms. Definitely get the crushed potatoes which are both crispy and fleshy. The gravy was excellent, the cheese curds were cheese curds and the mushrooms were cut to a perfect thickness.

The place could be a bit brighter. I dined in during the afternoon and had a hard time reading my book.

The total with tip came up to $11 for a very filling and yummy lunch, that's pretty inexpensive!"}
{"text":"Still thinking about this place a day later and wish I was in Montréal longer to have it again. The portions are very generous so unless you're starving go for a Regular size. This is especially important because the prices for the add-on are quite pricey. The interior is decent with some nice seating by the window. Normally I would dock off some stars for the lethargic and uninterested waitress but my poutine was so good I just can't do that this time.

I ordered a poutine with sweet potato fries as the base (!!!) then added bacon, pulled pork, jalapenos, hot peppers, sauteed onions and cole slaw. It was perfection! I think a little atypical since most of the poutines seem to have gravy and stuff but I absolutely loved mine more than most people who had more conventional ones on our table.

The area is nice and parking was very easy to find so I don't see why anything should stop you from eating here and then going on a stroll in Le Village after -- you'll need to burn off some calories."}
{"text":"Okay, so my first foray into trying poutine was at the McDonald's down the street from my hotel. Bad idea. My sister took me here on my last day in Montreal to have \"proper\" poutine. Poutineville has all kinds! I settled on the house poutine which came with cheese curds (duh), braised beef in wine sauce, and gravy. Man, talk about rich! My sister and I also shared a goat cheese salad to try and cut the richness of the poutine. Canadians eat this as a main entrée? I guess it's really no different than chili cheese fries but then again, I never eat that as a main either but I know some folks do.

The highlight for me here was actually one of their desserts - the Gateau fromage Bailey's Irish Cream (aka Bailey's Irish Cream cheesecake). This was one of THE best desserts I've ever had in my life. The crust was light and crumbly, the center, rich but not too rich and the milk chocolate shavings balanced it all beautifully. I have had dreams about this dessert since.

Poutineville is a chain so there a various locations throughout Quebec...You can't come to here and not try poutine. When in Rome, people..."}
{"text":"Tried it out as it's the highest-rated poutine place in Montreal beating out the ever-popular La Banquise. I have to say that though it was nice not to wait in line for a table, the product somewhat disappointed. Not bad; just not as good as La Banquise or Poutinis in Toronto. That this place uses crushed potatoes versus cut is interesting... I didn't like them as much. The gravy was a bit on the watery side. The curds, however were very fresh and squeaky. Overall I give it a pass... If you don't mind waiting in line go for La Banquise."}
{"text":"I knew this place was quite the hit in Montreal right after La Banquise so I HAD to try it out. The wait was not bad - 10-15minutes. Ordered the Shepherd's poutine but was disappointed, the beans and corn tasted either frozen or not fresh? I understand they don't get them fresh or locally as this is not your small local restaurant or maybe I was simply on a bad day. Anyways, went there TODAY to give them another chance, ordered the same thing. Everything tasted great and the waitress was a sweetheart. Cheered me up and now i will recommend it to my friends/family."}
{"text":"it's been more than 15 years I lived in Montreal. Best poutine place ever. 

You get a paper to make your own poutine. Add anything you want to create your own style. I added almost everthing inside.

It was perfect one. 

They also have their signature poutine and other already made combination. 

10/10 

Also good service. I ate 37$ poutine and no regret.. except I have to go to gym..."}
{"text":"Went to Poutineville for the first time with very high expectations.

I had the house special and my lunch partner had the Pulled pork.

First, ambiance and decor is a little rustic, but it's perfectly fine. It was nice to have the doors up on this hot summer day. Overall pleasant ambiance.

Lady waiter was a little abrupt but by no means rude and we were seated quickly. The rest of the staff were kind and effective.

Onto the Poutines. The house special was nice. The smashed potatoes were great. The braised beef was ok - not out of this world. The sauce was a little bland.

Same for the pulled pork. It was ok, but not crazy tasty. 

Would I go back? Meuh. Sure. But I wouldn't go out of my way to eat a Poutine there. I wasn't blown away. I love to be blown away at a restaurant. This one was just ok."}
{"text":"Having just arrived in Montreal last night, I knew I had to try poutine. And so I came here with a friend, with maybe only 30 minutes before closing time, but we were greeted, seated and served. Didn't know it was closing soon, but figured it out once most of the other patrons left. All of the staff were friendly to us, coming by to see if everything was good, several times during the meal. I never felt rushed even though it was near closing time, and I really appreciated that. Both of our poutine choices tasted awesome, and I can see why this place is highly rated. Great staff, decor, and food. Thanks poutineville!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick pre-dinner snack on our first day in Montreal.  Of course we had to get the House Poutine!  Our first poutine experience, their potatoes were smashed, not regular fries and the braised beef with the melty cheese curds and wine sauce makes the dish irresistible!  We shared a regular since it was a snack, but it could definitely be filling.  They also give you a sheet of paper & pencil in case you want to get creative and choose your own toppings.    Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Montreal!"}
{"text":"I had this Mexican style poutine with poutine sauce using the hand crushed potatoes.  Heard a lot of good reviews about this place. Omg. It tasted really bad. La banquise is far better. I will never go to this place again. Heard red wine gravy is better but I am not ready to try it."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try this place out, after having it hyped up by a friend (who I know appreciates fine Carby-goodness as much as I do!).

FOOD: 

My poutine of choice was the \"Sheppard's Pie,\" which was a concoction exactly as it sounds - minced beef, pees, corn, traditional gravy, and covered in baked mozzarella. As per my friend's advice, I went with the \"crushed potatoes\" instead of fries. Wasn't the biggest fan of having corn in my poutine (just didn't mesh well for me), but loved the chunky/crispy potatoes, and the gobs of melted cheese on top of everything.

SERVICE:

Our waitress Nikoleta was fantastic - she was friendly/engaging, and made sure to check-in on us to ensure we had everything we needed. We appreciated her explaining how the \"choose-your-own\" poutine option worked with a sincere smile on her face, even though she's probably had to do so about two dozen times already that day.

ATMOSPHERE:

Apparently on Monday night's, they allow some company called Paint Nite to book off about half the restaurant. So on this particular night, dinner was somewhat distracted by the Paint Nite host's obnoxious and endless yelling. We were also quite turned off to overhear the host (John) telling the table next to ours (on two occasions) that they could take over our table once they got us to leave. I appreciated our waitress and the manager apologizing, and don`t fault the restaurant for the Paint Nite host`s unwelcoming behaviour -  I do hope Poutineville considers the impact that this business-relationship might have on their own customers. 

SUMMARY: 

Convenient location close to the subway. Excellent service, and worth a try for poutine-lovers out there - just don`t go on a Monday night."}
{"text":"This was my first ever poutine experience and it was amazing! I love how you could pick exactly what you wanted from an english menu! The staff was very friendly and helpful too! What a great place to try Poutine for the first time!"}
{"text":"The perfect, fun place to try poutine! We visited this resto on our trip to Montreal. The food was excellent, with so many poutine varieties offered! Even the salAds looked fresh and delicious. We got the philly steak and custom poutines. So good! Service was great."}
{"text":"Went here when I was in Montreal mid-August. I liked that they had many options for poutine and that you could get chunks of potatoes instead of fries (a really nice switch). I had the Zeus poutine and it was pretty good. The toppings were abundant and the gyro meat was above average. The servings are huge though, so I would recommend splitting something if you visit. It is basic fast food, but I think something did not agree with me when I was here. Maybe it's just poutine in general, but it did give me some heart burn and a tummy ache. I might have got my fill for a lifetime."}
{"text":"Time: Wed night. 

I came here with my fiancé and it was pretty empty.  We tried the Wed special which was a platter of 3 mini-poutines: Veggie, Irish Stew (lamb) and Chili. The fries stayed crispy in all three poutines,  which was great. We enjoyed the Veggie,  followed by the chili and then the Irish Stew. The Veggie gravy was light and it came with corn and sautéed onions. The chili was meaty but felt really heavy and spiced more than we liked. The Irish Stew wasn't bad but tasted really gamy,  even for us, who love lamb. The service was good and they have a great selection of beer. I would definitely recommend coming to this place with a bunch of friends."}
{"text":"Il y a de biens meilleures options en ville pour manger de la poutine.  Les frites sont ordinaires, la sauce ordinaire pour une place hyper-ordinaire.  Les choix s'éloignent tellement de la poutine que le seul point en commun reste les frites.

Disappointed everytime."}
{"text":"My bridesmaids set up a bachelorette for me in Montreal.  One of the biggest to do's we had on our list was getting poutine.  There were tons of places that serve poutine, but why would we try it anywhere else when there is a place that only serves poutine!?  We took an Uber from the downtown area.  It was about 10-15 mins away.  We built our own plate and it was very good!  There was also a peach sangria that was good too.  There were tons of other options on the menu too.  If I come back to Montreal again, I will come back!"}
{"text":"Jusqu'à présent je ne jurais que par La Banquise (ouuh pauvre touriste influençable que je suis!) puis j'ai découvert Poutineville... 
Déjà, je l'écris en gros : prenez les PATATES ECRASEES !!! C'est tout simplement excellent. 
Le principe est simple, un crayon, une liste, et nous voilà à cocher les ingrédients que nous souhaitons ajouter à notre poutine : sauce, accompagnement et typologie de la frite. Pour un prix plus que convenable et un choix impressionnant.
Le lieu est sobre, accueillant et chaleureux et le service au top ! 
Je recommande et je donne 5 étoiles, car c'est pour moi la meilleure poutine de la ville."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best poutine places in town....the best in my opinion. Their menu offers several different types of unique poutine. There is also a \"customize your poutine\" menu, which is extremely convenient. Most of their gravies are both vegan and gluten-free - perfect for those who are vegan/ vegetarian and/ or have allergies. My fries were cooked well, and the gravy was amazing. Prices are also very reasonable. Standard poutine is $10.00 for a large, and $8.00 for a small. Certain add-ons cost a little extra.

The location was also nice - right in Montreal's gay village. There is even an option to sit outside when the weather permits. The restaurant was pretty crowded, which could explain the mediocre service. The server was nice enough, but seemed very passive and essentially slammed our meals on the table. Needless to say, I felt very rushed. 

All in all, the food is great and not too pricey. The service needs work, but that could have been explained by how busy it was. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My favourite poutine place ever! It might be discouraging to see that poutineville is a franchise but the poutines they sell are the best in the city. Everything they do is spot on and the prices are good. *order the crushed potatoes as your base, you won't regret it!*"}
{"text":"Pretty good poutine without the heavy and greasy feeling afterwards. With so many options, it's really hard to pick or create your own. 
I tried the Sheppard's Pie and found it alright - what threw me off was the pulled pork. Usually pulled pork has BBQ sauce, but this was literally just pork.
The hangover cure looks and tastes amazing but it does have a bit of a kick."}
{"text":"This is gluttony at it's best. Fried potatoes, cheese upon cheese and meat and gravy. About three bites in you have to fight the overwhelming hatred you feel for yourself and power through...it's that good. A \"regular size\" is so filling I could barely finish half.  Kudos to all the people around me who were sending back empty plates, that's quite a feat. We tried the Poutineville and the Montrealer and both were great. They had many different options to chose from and I would bet there is a poutine for everyone's palette.

Service was great! She was quick to get us refills and patient with our broken French. All in all a great poutine experience!"}
{"text":"Poutineville offers unique poutines to choose from or you can 'create your own poutine' which allows you to pick from a list of over 27 ingredients, 10 different cheeses, four kinds of potatoes and five kinds of sauces.  The options are endless at Poutineville and no matter what poutine you pick, you can be sure that all of the ingredients are of high quality using fresh Quebec cheese curds, farm-fresh local Ontario produce and premium meats.  For those of you who aren't a fan of poutine aka not a human being, can choose from burgers, sandwiches, appetizers, salads and flame-grilled items.

I have tried almost every poutine on the menu but the BEST so far were:

Montrealer - $12
Fresh crispy home fries with Montreal smoked meat, sautéed mushrooms, our home made poutine sauce with swiss cheese au gratin and a fried pickle on top

Pizza Poutine - $13
Hand crushed potatoes with fresh cheese curds, sautéed mushrooms, green peppers, our home made poutine sauce, pepperoni and topped with mozzarella au gratin

I truly enjoyed every poutine that I tried and finally got out of the 'classic' poutine phase.  I usually only eat the traditional style poutine, but Poutineville really steps up its game and concocts such innovative poutines that I really can't deny any of them thus far."}
{"text":"Don't give into temptation and over complicate your poutine ... Keep it simple but use the house specialty fries as the base.  

The best part of this place is the staff ... If you're looking for friendly, unintimidating, and good eats for a first time or pro poutine eater this is your place!"}
{"text":"Probably the best poutine i ever eat. Ever. The quality of the ingredients, the choices of sauce witch is all good . There is nothing bad i can say about this place"}
{"text":"Braised Beef and Curd Cheese
                   or
Well, I'll be a Son of a Bitch

    Poutineville is the grease spoon to kill all grease spoons(and far better than Greasy Spoon).
     
    I've been twice, each time I simply ordered food to go but whilst waiting for my order I took in the place. It is some good eating. 

  Putting interesting spins  on classic Quebec poutine, I'd go for Poutineville over La Banquaise, any day of the week but hey, that is just me.

   On our first visit, the owner(Costa?) was kind enough to provide a complementary braised beef poutine with blue cheese and a red wine gravy. I am a purist like fellow Yelper, Mathieu B. when it comes to poutine but holy hell, if this thing didn't sway me in the other direction. 

   And like any good dealer, shelling out things that are horribly addictive...the first one was free...but the next one will cost ya.

   Stop waiting in line @ La Banquaise like a douche bag and go and try Poutineville, you won't regret it.

Waka waka"}
{"text":"Hands down the best poutine in Toronto. If you have never had poutine or don't understand what the craze is, do yourself a favour and come try poutine at poutineville (always opt for crushes potatoes rather than regular fries). 

The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. There's fun music but it's not a overwhelming as bars where you have to shout to hear. The waiters/waitresses are all incredibly sweet and attentive. I've been here quite a few times and have been served by many different ones but I have never had any experience but wonderfully pleasant from their servers which they refer to as ambassadors as they all believe in providing the most satisfying service to every customer. 

Onto the food! This place is no 3 Michelin star restaurant but you will find no better poutine than at Poutineville. How often do you eat Smokes' poutine, feel kind of gross and then throw out the rest of the box? If you come to Poutineville I will almost guarantee that you will take out whatever leftovers you have, bring it home, and enjoy the hell out of it for lunch the next day. ALWAYS get the crushed potatoes over regular fries, you will thank me for it later. Be adventurous, build your own, even if it's your first time trying it! Put together whatever ingredients you like and I bet it will 99% of the time always go together, if it didn't taste good you were the 1% sorry... Some recommendations, goat cheese, bacon, marinated eggplant, braised beef, and an egg. I am literally drooling as I am typing this.."}
{"text":"Hum ils sont cohérents dans leur positionnement : c'est plus cher que les autres poutines, mais c'est meilleur que les autres poutines. La spécialité québécoise est ici revisitée et déclinée en des recettes originales, en témoigne la carte riche en propositions. Et pour encore plus de choix (donc plus de complications pour moi), il est même possible de composer sa propre poutine grâce à une grille d'ingrédients et un crayon à disposition. 

Le cadre m'a fait penser à une brasserie parisienne. Les tables sont espacées entre elles, permettant un peu d'intimité."}
{"text":"Poutineville is awesome!

I was referred here by my bartender at a different restaurant. Obviously with the name Poutineville, you can get all sorts and combinations of it! The house poutine was amazing, with braised shredded beef, cheese curds, and wine gravy. They give you options on what you want on the poutine, with upgrades from a standard price.

Our server was very very busy. The place was packed. But amazingly, the server was still pleasant and attentive.

They serve a select few beers and wines.  

I sat a table near the front window, so I saw every type of person come in. It was especially funny seeing tourists wheeling in their big full sized suitcase in there. The place is just so good that you want to go to it right off the plane if you're visiting. haha"}
{"text":"Lorsque je me sens d'humeur à changer de ma Poutine régulière, c est là que je me rend.

Imaginer créer votre propre Poutine selon vos envies les plus folles, avec un larges choix tout est possible ici !

Je suis du genre à vivre dangereusement avec mes aliments, donc ici je joue, mélange et découvre des combinaisons loufoques et surtout succulente !!"}
{"text":"I  just had my first ever poutine here so I don't feel like I have the right to judge it yet. I can say that it was as good as you imagine fries with cheese and gravy to be. The potions are big. You definitely won't leave hungry. Nevertheless I have the feeling that there might be much more impressive poutines out there. Poutines that are not just exactly what you expect, but ones that can completely change your view on this Quebec classic. I'll sure let you know when I've ate my way through Montreal's poutineries and found the holy grail.
The money you leave here depends very much on what you choose to top your poutine with. If you go with the cheapest options you can get away with $10."}
{"text":"Been here several times and I absolutely love this place! Great selection of both pre-made Poutines and custom ingredients to make your Poutine the best. I had a custom one with bacon, tomatoes, ground beef and 4 different cheeses. Total came to about $14 which would be pricey for a normal Poutine, but the amount of food I had can feed a Canadian family of 4 for a couple of meals. The portions were HUUGGEEE. Great atmosphere, with a patio over-looking Ontario Street which is amazing. The servers were very friendly and was able to easily accommodate our table of 8."}
{"text":"A friend mentioned that there weren't any poutine places in Toronto that put Pogos in their poutine.  So when I happened upon this place Halloween night, I was extremely pleased to see if I could try this wicked concoction.
You have the choice of their popular combinations of Poutine or creating your own.  I made my own, because when do you ever have the opportunity of morphing all the things you love into one poutine?  Answer:  Just this one time!
The poutine with pogo and mushrooms was hot, cheesy and delicious!  Prices aren't exactly cheap, but you get a whole lot for your buck.  I had it for dinner and brought the rest back for my sister.
I plan on coming back and hitting their AYCE poutines."}
{"text":"Food is good and we like them. We would not return or recommend.

The main reason I give 3 is their service. Expect ordering food, nobody come and ask like \"is everything ok\" or \" do you need refill\" even I finished my water for 10 minutes there is no one notice me. 
I will be fine if all of them are busy and everyone was treated like me. But the fact is she walk directly to the other table and ask is everything ok and what else do they need.
When I finished another waiter comes and told us we have to pay 17% tips not 15% or 10%. I didn't compute at that time and now I am wondering is that a rule I \"have to pay tips \"not \" your services are good so I am willing to pay ?\"

I don't care about I paid more tips, I am not satisfied."}
{"text":"The breaded pickles are amazing. I ordered mushrooms on mine and I only had maybe 3 pieces, I also ordered bacon, and that too was very skimpy. Over all it is a good place , the smashed potatoes are very good.The staff friendly, but considering I did not get very many toppings on my poutine, I was let down a little. I will eat there again tho.."}
{"text":"Hands down best poutine I've had so far. Ate here earlier and had a really great experience. Aside from the tasty food, our server was super nice and attentive and gave us recommendations for things to do in town. Highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Restaurant spécialiste de la poutine. Un vrai régal pour moi à chaque visite. La constitution de la poutine est personnalisée par le client. Les serveurs sont toujours de bons conseils et efficace."}
{"text":"J'y ai testé pour la première fois la poutine. Pas léger, mais une chouette expérience. Service sympa."}
{"text":"For the whole week, I've been sampling poutine at different places in Montreal. I must say that so far, I've never met a poutine I didn't like. However, Poutineville elevated my perception of just how good poutine can be. This wasn't just good food-- it was an experience for the eyes, nose and palate. On top of this, the culinary artwork they serve up to you is served fast and with a smile. It's a good thing that we found this place late in the trip, or else I might not have eaten anywhere else."}
{"text":"Was told that poutine is a must try when in Montreal so of course had to make the trip to a place called poutineville. Me and my friend shared a regular sized fire breather which was more than enough food. Oh and it was delicious. Instead of fries, they used very tasty homemade potatoe bits. The gravy on top had a nice little kick to it and was really good. And the cheese curds were awesome as well. Overall amazing meal, and would recommend as the place to go for poutine. Friend tried poutine at a regular fast food place and was disgusted, so glad I had a better experience than him!"}
{"text":"Deux poutines en une semaine? Ce n'est pas une habitude normale, mais avec toutes les combinaisons possibles, je n'ai pas mangé le même ingrédient deux fois! Le look de Poutineville m'a surpris simplement parce que je m'attendais à un endroit de style \"fast-food.\" Au contraire, c'est un joli resto avec des grandes fenêtres qui s'ouvrent pour donner l'impression d'être sur une terrasse, peu importe où l'on est assis. Plusieurs bonnes bières québécoises en fût complémentent très bien les options de poutines dont celles de Cheval Blanc. Vous pouvez soit choisir chacun des ingrédients vous-même ou bien, vous pouvez y aller avec une des combinaisons déjà décidées pour vous. Le Classique est délicieux, surtout pour le buf braisé! Des options de burgers et de salades sont aussi disponibles pour ceux qui n'aiment pas vraiment la poutine. Définitivement à recommander et à essayer à plusieurs reprises!"}
{"text":"Après une pas mal grosse soirée qui avait commencée un peu trop tôt dans la journée, il était temps que je me mette quelque chose sous la dent. Étant juste devant la pancarte de Poutineville, et ayant déjà goûté aux poutines de la branche sur la rue Ontario, je n'ai pas hésité une seconde. Le menu est le même et le service est aussi très bien. La seule raison pourquoi ils ont une étoile en moins, c'est simplement que je préfère le décor de celui sur Ontario, parce que le reste est vraiment au même niveau. Définitivement un endroit à visiter pour une bonne poutine peu importe le temps de la journée!"}
{"text":"Came in with my girlfriend after hearing about this place from a friend. My friends definitely over hyped this place. The service was good. The food was okay. We tried out their all you can eat poutine, and if you ask me, it was more like all you can eat fries. The selections are very limited and the portion is very SMALL. It works to their advantage as the fries to topping ratio... 


Service: 9/10
Food: 5/10 (lukewarm gravy, soggy fries, meh portion)  

Would I visit again? Maybe."}
{"text":"Best poutine ever!  We ordered the classic poutine with extra curds and zucchini, sooooo yummy.  The owner was very friendly and the staff was wonderful.  Looking forward to coming back to Montreal and trying different versions of this fantastic classic dish!"}
{"text":"Let me say this, I am not a poutine-connoisseur  by any stretch of the imagination, but once you've had it, you've probably had them all. However, once the basics (fries) are done well, then anything else is cool. So we came here, my girl makes sure we have this stuff whenever we come to Montreal, and the atmosphere was chill. It was a Sunday, after all, so that may have played a part.  We made custom orders and it was really good. we ordered regular sizes and the portions were more than enough. The waiter was cool too. Very engaging and friendly. I will definitely go back when i return."}
{"text":"This is my new #1.

So last year on my trip to Montreal I did my \"poutine crawl\" and Fameux Viande Fumee Et Charcuterie came out on top.  However, if I'd been to Poutineville last year, it would have been my #1.

First of all, everyone who works there is super attractive.  So that's never bad.  Second, they take your order quickly.  I had my beer before I batted an eye.  

The best part is the \"build your own poutine\" option.  They have several options for the potatoes and I got them crushed and that's what sent me over the moon.  To those I added curds, swiss, pepperoni and gyro meat and I must say it was one of the most delicious things I've ever put in my mouth.  I should have ordered the large.  I would have eaten it for sure.

I'm in love with Poutineville and I want to live there!"}
{"text":"The service, the food, the atmosphere, the music, the quality, the innovation! How can you say no?!

We were greeted and seated in a very timely manner. I was so excited to see the options, only to be trumped seeing that you can literally BUILD YOUR OWN! I was absolutely astounded to see that you could get so many KINDS of cheese, so many different options; where do you begin?!

I chose to create my own. The fries weren't soggy, the gravy wasn't clumpy OR runny, the cheese was MELTED, oh good god it was heaven. When they brought our food to our tables, they used our names that we wrote down on the sheet. I could not believe the service we were getting. 

It was wonderful to be part of this place, the food, man, you've gotta go and see for yourself. It may be small, but it packs a huge punch. Oh, and before I forget, I took some of mine home (the portions are actually pretty big!), and it was STILL great the next day! I've been back so many times."}
{"text":"Came here to meet some new friends.  The place is small, but uses their space well.  My friends had arrived earlier, and I found them easily.  I sat down and the owner came over to greet me and get my drink order.  I pointed to a beer that sat in front of everybody at the table.  He smiled and rushed off.  An order sheet was placed in front of me. A cool breeze blew in through the great open wall in the front of the place.
     The thing was in french, and I did my best to figure out what stuff was.  After a few minutes I had a sheet with some stuff checked off, not rightfully knowing what half of it was. The owner took it, and I also asked for a plate of fried pickles. I chatted with my friends, and occasionally got left behind when they would all switch over to French. Luckily, one of them would take a moment to pause the conversation and \"subtitle\" the conversation for me. They were all nice people.
     My beer came over and it was huge and delicious.  The pickles came out and they were also delicious. They were in spear format, which was kinda new. I've only had the chips before.  But these were a bit spicey, and salty-briney also. Very tasty indeed.
     The poutine came out, each person had an individual bowl placed in front of them. Each personalized by what they had checked off on their lists. Or in my case, what I had randomly checked off my list.  It had to be eaten with a fork.  Cheese, meats, veggies and french fires smothered in sauce blended magically. Delicious.
     We chatted, ate, drank, and made merry for some time.  But all good things must come to an end, and we called it after an hour or two.

        Great place, friendly owner, good drinks, good Poutine. it's a keeper in my books."}
{"text":"Overwhelming amount of choice, in an amazing way. The fries are always cooked to perfection and thanks to the yard sale of a list to pick from, this veggiesaurus always leaves here happy and not stuck with the usual 'original'. Great for groups, never have to wait long to get in and the servers are all fun and helpful. And for the record, there was cheese even at the bottom; that's a winner in my book."}
{"text":"Poutineville serves up what is arguably the best poutine in town. The house potatoes beat french fries any day and all their gravies are vegan, so what's not to love there? At Poutineville, your food is exactly what you want it to be, so all it takes is a little imagination. You could order one of their pre-selected combos, but where's the fun in that? I highly recommend you start with the house potatoes and wine gravy, then dream up your most delicious combination. Cheese curds are available for the hardcore lacto friendlies and there is Daiya for the rest of us."}
{"text":"Poutine and chicken wings 911 are so good!  Service is also great.  The large order is really gigantic!  Overall, we had our very first poutine experience in the right place"}
{"text":"I went there recently and had the filet mignon poutine! wow! oh, and try the oreo cheesecake! Service could use improvement but you won't care after you have your first bite of the filet mignon poutine!"}
{"text":"Parfait ! Nous avons mangé ici notre première Poutine et la qualité est au rendez-vous ! Leur patate écrasé maison sont super bonne. Pouvoir créer sa propre Poutine est vraiment plaisant. Les bières moins chère les soirs de match sont un plus. Nous avons toujours passé des bons moments dans ce restaurant. Les serveurs sont très sympa. Pour manger une bonne Poutine je ne peux que vous conseiller. Pensé à réserver pour ne pas attendre, le restaurant est petit."}
{"text":"Went here with my mom and sister had the 911 chicken wing poutine and fell in love  along with an amazing dessert!! Service is awesome and staff is friendly defiantly a compliment to Montreal dining !"}
{"text":"Montreal Smoked Meat poutine (despite the server from Quebec; wasn't big on ot) was sub-par. La banquise was way better. HOWEVER (UNDERLINED AND ITALICS IF COULD) their specialty red wine braised beef IS TO DIE FOR! ambience with lovely couches and countertops will make you feel very happy. Music is awesome and personnel is kind."}
{"text":"I thought this place was going to knock my socks off with some sort of gourmet poutine.  I mean it was good but it didn't jump out at me as being THAT much better than any other poutine that I have had, in my albeit limited poutine eating lifetime.  I mean I would go here again if I was in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way like I did this time to go.  Serving size was good and it really hit the spot.  

We went here right before heading over to Dieu Du Ciel so it was the perfect meal to offset the copious amount of beer that we enjoyed that evening."}
{"text":"Nice little place that we tried yesterday night with some of our friends.
I love poutine and my friend recommended this place so I was excited to try.
After all I was really satisfied.
I took the montrealer, my hubby took the fire breather.
Both were tasteful with a lot of gravy and tops.
If you wanna try good poutine you should come here. 
Probably we're coming back and try another ones.
Next time maybe I will do my own combo. :)"}
{"text":"Loved the Poutine here! I had the cut fries with curds, mushrooms, tomatoes & traditional gravy. My friend had the house special smashed potatoes with the Meat sauce (can't recall what it was called, looked like meat spaghetti sauce). We both loved our food and found the small size to be a generous portion. Plenty for our lunch. Waitress was very kind and great service. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I love that you can build your own Poutine any way you like it.  SOOO many options!"}
{"text":"One of the best poutine places in town - as a casual vegetarian, it's refreshing to be able to customize your poutine order, and from my understanding, their gravy is vegetarian as well. I highly recommend the crushed potatoes and the red wine gravy (the extra $1 is super worth it). I wouldn't recommend getting the guac or eggplant though. Portions are HUGE and decently priced. Service is quick and responsive. It can get quite busy though, so if you're in a large group, you should make a reservation!"}
{"text":"I hate poutine...I really do. It never appealed to me. However, when I saw Poutineville in MTL featured on You Gotta Eat Here! It just looked too damn good to not go to.

When my group of three went, on a Saturday  night I figured it would be pretty busy. Luckily it wasn't (yet), and we got a seat right away. The decor was really nice, with dark lighting from some cool Edison bulbs, nice wood walls..definitely more fancy looking than I expected.

I ordered the pizza poutine, while my two other guests decided to create their own via the cards provided. You can basically decide what you want, and make your own unique poutine creation! Be careful: this can get pricey.

When the food came, everyone but my sister received hers. Apparently they had dropped it and we're making a new one. It was a good 5-8 min before she got that plate, and me and my Boyfriend were just staring at our poutines getting cold..feeling bad about eating without her.

Anyways, the poutine. The pizza poutine was awesome..the portion was actually the size of a pizza and I made it about halfway before tapping out. The other two poutine creations were also amazing, as both of the plates were literally cleaned completely.

Overall, I would go back. $60 for three giant plates of food, two beers and a coke? Not bad.I liked the idea of the create your own poutine, and the atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"I had been to Poutineville once before a couple of years back, and enjoyed my experience so much I have been meaning to go back since! I finally had the occasion and it was just as good as I remembered! Our server was extremely nice and helpful, making sure to check in on us every so often to see if we needed anything else. We started off by ordered cheese quesadillas and fried pickles. I have no idea what they do to those quesadillas, but wow they are some of the best I ever had. The pickles were ok, nothing I would recommend. Now time for the poutine: I chose the build your own poutine option and got the crushed potatoes, regular gravy, cheese curds and cheddar cheese, sautéed onions and pogo bits. It arrived pretty quickly and was seriously tasty, the only thing I would fault it for was there was SO much topping compared to actual potatoes. I would really give this a 4.5/5 and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys poutine."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Great food, great service. The gravy here is sublime! You will not regret coming here!"}
{"text":"J'ai testé en 2 jours la banquise et ici, j'ai vraiment préféré ce restaurant !
J'ai écouté les conseils du serveur ( comm la banquise ) et je me suis régalé !
Je conseille fortement cet endroit pour ceux qui veulent découvrir la poutine !
Je repars avec le sourire :)"}
{"text":"It's really hard to go wrong here. The choices can be a bit daunting because there's the option of building your own poutine. I opted to go with the \"Poutineville\" as it was the most popular dish (according to my waitress).

As a first time visitor, I appreciated the fact that I was walked through the different ordering choices and, most importantly, shown the dishes that a regular and large are served in. I opted for the regular which was more than enough, but I still finished it. The red wine sauce was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"This review is, again, waaay over due, but I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here, thus I would like to share it with other potential customers. 

We came here on Thanksgiving Monday, specifically to build our own poutines. I quite enjoyed the concept, and was surprised by the plethora of options given for type of fries, sauces, meats, veggies and cheeses. I built a poutine version of a Philly cheese steak; regular & sweet potato fries, cheese curds, gravy, flank steak and green peppers. 

Three words: AH. MAY. ZZZING. 

It was delish; I am a huge poutine fan (duh, who in Quebec isn't!!) and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to venture outside the \"fries, cheese curds and gravy\" boundaries of the original poutine!"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant in yelp. Poutine is a food you can never miss in Montreal! These pontine were so big size and rich in cheeses but a bit salty. I like the M poutine more.

The waitress was so friendly!"}
{"text":"Thank you my fellow Yelpers for helping me discover this place. Whenever I am in Quebec I always get poutine. This place has mastered poutine! You have the option to build your own choosing which ingredients you want. I tried the Sampler which allowed me to try two smaller sized poutines.  It was a generous portion, but I just couldn't put down my fork!! 

Also the service was amazing despite being pretty crowded. The owner even came out and chatted with me. He happily switched to English for me and answered all my menu questions. Ohh and get a Bloody Caesar to wash down all that poutine. Seemed like the crowd was mostly locals which I always love! Def worth a trip!"}
{"text":"What's a trip to Canada without trying some poutine?! What's great about this place is that besides the different kinds of poutines that are on the menu, you can make your own, from choosing the type of potatoes, to cheese, gravy, protein and anything extra you want to add. My wife and I got two separate \"small\" plates and we had to take a good portion of it to go. Can't imagine anyone finishing a large plate in one sitting. Wish we had this place in the states, would've been the ultimate go to food."}
{"text":"Poutine dressé à la lettre comme vous l'aimez, poutineville offre une variété infinie de garnitures, patates, sauces... et qui sortent de l'ordinaire!!!! Fromage bleu, patates douces ou écrasées, sauce 911 (dans le nouveau sur ontario) ou au vin rouge, toutes les sortes de légumes ou viandes que vous pouvez imaginer... et ils ont un service très attentionné également. J'adore!"}
{"text":"HUGE portions! I love the fact that you can create your own poutine! There are so many variations that you can create. The server is always friendly (it has always been the same when i go there) and the you don't have to wait a long time for you order to get to the table! I also like the hamburger steak a lot. It's smothered in gravy and the coleslaw that comes with is really good! I used to like La Banquise a lot but this place has come to be my favourite poutine joint!"}
{"text":"Yes...so after trying another 4 poutine places every night at 11 (I work out now) poutineville is easily the best poutine I had. Granted I did not try LaBanquise because there was a huge line. Poutineville manages to make poutine taste light! Its not like french fries with gravy and melted cheese. Its more of baked potato with skin taste with amazing gravy that is tasty as not too tangy. Their sauteed onions and mushrooms are great and sweet. The curds are simply ah-mazing! Squeaky morsels that stay put and not melt into one big chunk. Service is good and fast. Price is a bit high though."}
{"text":"Frites corrects .. J'avais des grosses attentes ... On compose sa propre sorte : frites, sauces, garnitures etc avec extra...
Decor correct, service correct..."}
{"text":"Was craving for some poutine so definitely had to go to the place that was named after it. Went for a very late lunch around 3 and the place was pretty empty. Only two other tables were seated. Guess they were trying to save on energy, there was no air conditioning when it was over 30 degrees out. There was only one waitress and she was busy. Took a while to get her attention and to get some service.

There's a pre designed poutine menu for people who don't want to think. For those who like to create their own, there's a piece of paper where you can design the poutine. Definitely have to try the smashed potato poutine, something unique to Poutineville. The smashed poutine makes it easier to get a full bite with everything. The portion size was big and really filling, for gourmet prices. One important factor for poutine is melted cheese and this one definitely passed the test. The gravy and fries both freshly made melted all the cheese. The fries were coated by the other ingredients but didn't become soggy at all. This place makes good poutine !

Overall, will definitely come back again to get more poutine and maybe update this review."}
{"text":"Super concept pour bâtir sa poutine sur mesure. Il y en a pour tout les goûts. Note spéciale pour leur burger maison qui est très très bon. Service assez rapide et possibilité de boire une bière avec sa poutine."}
{"text":"Holy Canada this is the holy grail of poutine!

For the unbeknownst tourist, poutine was invented in Montreal so when in Montreal....  With 3 weeks in the city I made it my quest to find the best poutine in the city. This place my followers takes the cake. 

Additionally, and to be fair to the rest of the poutine palaces, 

In my eyes, there are 3 categories of poutine:

Low: generic curds, brown gravy on fries

Mid tier: quality ingredients but not deviating too far from the original dish premise. 

Posh: gourmet potatoes with exotic meats as toppings (i.e. duck confitt, tuna)

This place is a firm mix between the mid-level and posh. 
Thy off menu where you can create your own custom masterpiece. 

On the first visit I tried the original as well as the General Tso's poutine. The second i just stuck to the original version; why be adventurous when the original is that GOOD!

Man nothing beats the original! Soft fluffy cheese curds and uber crunchy fries that somehow stayed nice and crispy while being covered in gravy, The gamechanger was the red wine gravy; it  was simply amazing! It was to tasty and did not overpower, over grease or over anything to the dish. It was perfect! I wish I could take home a gallon of it an brush my teeth every morning with it. 

The kung pao poutine was \"different\":. For all my asian friends think of a Panda's express bowl but with fries and cheese instead of rice... Asian food and cheese are not really complimentary on my taste palette so it was kind of a miss for me,  

Tourists:
If you only have once chance to try poutine; this would be my recommendation. 
Eat with confidence."}
{"text":"Server was really friendly and knowledgable. They had a customizable poutine option which was cool because we could build our own! Food was great, I'd definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"First time having Poutine and I'm beginning to understand Canada's fascination with the simple but tasty dish. 

The place is in very close proximity to the Royal Ontario Museum and is highly regarded as one of the better places for Poutine in Toronto. In addition to the standard menu, Poutineville offers a one sheet custom Poutine menu in which you can configure your Poutine to your preferred specifications.

In the end the Poutine was of course, delicious, and I'll strongly recommend visiting Poutineville if your're in Toronto and want to enjoy your meal in a laid back, friendly environment with a companionable wait staff and decent music."}
{"text":"Like the tourists that we are, we came to Poutineville on our first night in Montreal. Located a few blocks away from our Air Bnb, we made the short walk over and arrived into a crowded, lively environment. We ordered at the bar with a customized poutine request and I ended up picking a poutine with braised beef and my friend got one with chicken. Both were really good, with plentiful portions, crispy fries and a delectable gravy smothering everything in its midst. Not quite the best poutine I've had, but a great option for the location."}
{"text":"i've been meaning, waiting and damn near salivating to this place for months now. 

it was absolutely worth the wait...

a very easy location to get to, the restaurant is a decent sized in comparison to how you would assume it looks from the outside. i wanted to make this a special night, and go out with a bunch of my friends for a xmas dinner. half of my friends ended up cancelling on me, which really wouldn't have matter either way. we went on a Saturday night, every tv had hockey on, but the place was dead...i didn't understand this, and at the end of the review, you won't understand either. most of the party was here, just waiting on one last friend to show up, we were served by Alison (we called her Alice in wonderland, of a poutine nature, which got a good laugh out of her) who was an absolute pleasure to be served by. she gave us the run down of how things went, we can go through the menu, or we can do the option of \"making your own poutine\" awesome! i was already impressed! my friends and i made through our options, and proceeded to order through Alice, now we might have gotten caught up in our conversations, but no sooner we got into the groove of talking, the app's showed up. soon enough all of our main's showed up, minus my S.o's to which Alice took notice of and responded with, I'll get you an answer right away. within a minute she came back and said they're has been a delay, really sorry, but you should have it within three minutes, which to her credit, the poutine got to the table in three minutes. also, because of the delay, she presented my S.o with some coupons for the next time that we came back. they're wasn't a single complaint about the food, across the board, we were all extremely satisfied with our food. to further the point with Alice's awesome service, we all got glasses of water, aside from our other drinks, NONE of us hit the bottom of the water glass, within 60 seconds of clearing our food, each individual cleared plate was taken away, and she genuinely cared about us as a group, talking with us, and just having amazing bedside manner. the dessert was amazing as well, they only had three options but it was really fantastic. 

i really don't understand how empty this restaurant was with all the amazing service we received, and all the delicious food we had.

poutineville? more like Poutine-heaven...will defiantly be back :) 
and we will be back to take on the $100 Poutine...whats the $100 poutine? pay 100 bucks, and get 15 lbs of poutine...amazing

*they also serve app's, and burgers, aside from poutine* 

I'm not ashamed to say that Alice received my second biggest tip I've ever given out, she defiantly earned it, and did it with seemingly no effort. amazing service by a very talented lady who needs to be patted on her back for a flawless service. i honestly have nothing negative to say about the service at all and i will be sending a high recommendation to whoever can listen. 

*my only 2 tiny issues, cause its not big enough for a complaints* 
the hot wings(911 flavor) are not hot at all, very flavorful, but not hot. 
they had plastic chairs opposite of booth seating, and for someone who is just over 300lbs...i didn't feel comfortable sitting in those plastic chairs.

amazing place, and i think my newest go-2 for poutine"}
{"text":"Well, if you're looking for poutine just look around for the place with the line out the door - this is it. The poutine tasted as expected and wasn't overpriced - same with the beer selection. You can customize your poutine to your heart's delight - which I think is the real strength of Poutineville. Check it out - but be prepared for a wait and cramped conditions."}
{"text":"It's poppin in here. Good vibes in the ville! I like their checklist system. Always a fun way and it makes things easy.

I really enjoyed the poutine. I got lactose free cheese, peppers, and cole slaw. A good combo. But poutine isn't that great... I just don't LOVE poutine.

Here's a big problem... it's expensive. Poutine is 15 without tip! Redic"}
{"text":"Not as good as others but still satisfying! I enjoy the option of creating it all by yourself and the sweet potato fries are delish!"}
{"text":"I've visited this location maybe 3 times now; it's pretty much a must-visit it Montreal and I have never been disappointed.  I've also never been able to finish a full plate in one sitting. It's an ambitious idea but not highly recommended if you actually want to continue your day (insert food coma) or make it home at the end of your night and not wake up still sitting at the table (call an Uber).  The decor is simple, warm and inviting. There's plenty of wood for cozy winter nights and the heat works well even if you're like me and prefer to sit in the window when it's 8 degrees out because you're addicted to people-watching on the street.  There's also free wifi, a plus for us tourists with limited data plans.

Food:
You get the option of choosing from one of the many poutine experiences that they offer or go completely of script with the selection card that they offer to you. I kind of want to go back and just check all the boxes and see what they say one day; there's a lot of boxes!  Choose your preferred cheese(s), choose your preferred gravy (vegans welcomed), choose from so many meat options and even your style of fries/potatoes. I recommend the home style cuts that they do.  The only way that you'll be disappointed in this restaurant is if you get too outlandish with you choice of flavor mixing, but the ingredients are good so i really can't see one going off the rails.

There's finally also some good beer options local and import.  I believe that there may be dessert, but I've only ever made it to the to-go boxes. Don't forget to wear your sweat pants/yoga pants/something with an elastic waistband."}
{"text":"The poutine here was kinda crappy. 
I thought it would be hard to fuck up poutine but the fries were under cooked, almost still raw potato and the beef brisket poutine was more oil than any other ingredient.
However we went on a Tuesday night for the all you can eat for 15 bucks, maybe this explains the lack of effort out into the food as there was so much to get done? Maybe? Perhaps I'm making excuses for the place because I feel bad about bad mouthing it. 
I certainly wot be going back to try again though. 
I can't complain about the service though."}
{"text":"Pour un resto \"sauvetage de faux plan\", Poutineville s'est avéré être un super endroit. Bien sûr on avait de tourie façon prévu de le tester mais là quand il a fallu se rabattre sur une nouvelle idée après un resto annulé pour cause d'adresse changée sans prévenir, il faut bien admettre que c'est Poutineville qui nous a sauté aux yeux. 

La salle ouverte en été est bien agencée de manière à ce que personne n'est collé, le service est sympa et fait un peu penser à celui d'un pub. On nous sert de l'eau dès que le verre est vide ce qui est toujours mieux que de devoir en réclamer soi-même ! 
Et pour les poutines ? J'ai pris la spécialité, la Poutineville, aux patates écrasées (attention ce n'est pas de la purée mais bien quelque chose qui se rapproche des frites), au buf effiloché, à la sauce vin rouge et bien sûr au fromage ! Le buf effiloché, j'annonce tout de suite, ce n'est pas ma viande préférée mais là c'est passé bien comme il faut, dans cette sauce qui tient bien ses promesses et sur ce lit de patates tout simplement délicieux. J'ai pris la taille normale, la grande de mon copain m'a parue gigantesque et il a eu du mal à la finir. 

On ne peut que saluer le large choix de recettes + la possibilité de créer sa propre poutine. Un must-go montréalais qui ne fait pas trop touristique et qui est à la hauteur de tout ce qu'on dit de cette fameuse spécialité gastronomique !"}
