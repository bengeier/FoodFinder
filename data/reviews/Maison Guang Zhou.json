{"text":"This feels like one of the better places to eat in Chinatown in Montreal. Named as a Guangzhou restaurant, it actually also offers other popular Chinese dishes, such as boiling spicy fish fillet, kungpao chicken, and etc. The cooking is about average, and depending on what you order, you may hit or miss. 

I have ordered one of the chef's recommendations (there are pictures of them on the wall and also listed on the menu), salted crispy squid with spice. It tastes quite good. The flour-wrapping is very thin and crispy, with squid fried to the exact tenderness inside. The spices are light, thus the dish is not spicy nor oily. It does not come with a sauce as the picture on the wall shows.

The other dish is a miss. The fried egg with clam and chive is pretty disappointing. The dish does not contain chive at all. They use instead garlic stems, still an acceptable combination though. The egg is over-cooked and too salty. I think there is a mild taste of msg. 

Overall, it is still a good choice for late night dinning and it feels like the recommended dishes on the menu would be safer choice."}
{"text":"Authentic. Not for the less adventurous. I ordered a chicken dish, but it was questionable which part of the chicken it came from! Quite tasty though. Service friendly."}
{"text":"I only come here for the lunch specials. They taste great, portions are fair, and the price is just too low.

Oh, and the waiters are very friendly and the service is pretty hasty."}
{"text":"Tasty authentic Chinese cuisine with some more Westernized options for the less adventurous (myself). This place is open late! Really late. We got there at almost 2AM and I think this place closes at 4AM. Chinese is an awesome alternative to your typical drunk food! 

We sat down and were immediately brought tea. I ordered an egg roll and my boyfriend ordered a few veggie spring rolls. My egg roll was tasty and my boyfriend's spring rolls were really yummy. I ended up choosing the kung pow chicken because like I said I'm not always the most adventurous person. My boyfriend ordered a more traditional Cantonese dish, it was pureed tofu and vegetables, formed into balls and then fried and served with a mushroom sauce. 

My kung pow was MSG heavy but really good. I asked for it extra spicy and I didn't think it was as spicy as it could be but the ingredients were fresh and high quality and the sauce was really really good. My boyfriend's was really interesting but tasty, the mushroom sauce was really tasty but he preferred the tofu balls dipped in the sweet and sour sauce. The portions here were insanely big. I finished maybe 25% of mine and I was completely full, my boyfriend finished about half. 

I think the waiter thought we didn't enjoy our food because he gave us a (friendly) lecture about always asking details about a dish before ordering it. He said that if we ever come back and are unsure about something make sure to ask and they'll make sure you know exactly what you're getting. We explained we liked it but couldn't finish it. He was really nice and his little pep talk was nice haha. My food was $25 with tip, for 2 meals - maybe more, I can't complain.

I could see myself coming back here for late night Chinese."}
{"text":"I arrived in Montreal hungry. Since I had a lunchtime flight from Philadelphia to Montreal, I didn't want to waste my appetite on packaged peanuts. When I landed, a friend took me to a Chinese restaurant, La Maison de Guang Zhou.

It was around 2:30 pm, and not crowded. The interior looks like any other Chinese restaurant. Alcohol was available, but I didn't indulge. Instead, we had warm tea that kept the outside chill at bay.

We shared orders of a pepper calamari squid, a tasty fried rice, and a good, tender beef dish of some sort. This wholesome, happy, scrumptious meal fed me, and not for a lot of money. (Credit cards accepted.) Recommended!"}
{"text":"Pretty authentic! Flavors are on point, the portions are huge (so come hungry or with a group). The service is pleasant, and once you've ordered, food delivery is fast. Having tried a bunch of places around, this, hands down, is one of the best! Check it out! There is a western menu for those who aren't too familiar with more authentic Cantonese food."}
