{"text":"This past Saturday, we were walking to a place we planned to have lunch, passed Tres Rios and decided to try it instead.  So glad we did!!  We are still talking about how delicious everything was.  The hostess/owner was delightful.  Most everything they make is homemade.  We ordered the chips & salsa sampler, fish tacos and pato tacos.  The chips came with three different salsas; I can't say which was best because they all tasted so good and fresh.  I noticed the chips were also fresh (which is rare is some places).  The tacos were just delicious!  I especially liked the seasoning and dressing they use.  Lastly, I wanted to point out that their bathrooms were the cleanest I have ever been in.  I will definitely be stopping back!"}
{"text":"BEST SOFT TACOS IN PITTSBURGH!!!  My wife and I make this stop here at Tres Rios at least twice a month. The soft tacos are the best in Pittsburgh. Actually, the best I ever had. We just ate at Round Corner Cantina two nights ago and we were really disappointed. There literally is no comparison. I think it's better than Tako too!   Tres' soft tacos are hand made corn which they flash deep fry before they stuff them with the perfect amount of meat, crunch, spice and sweetness. It's a flavor explosion in your mouth. I love the Pato (duck leg) and my wife prefers the shrimp. I like the lamb too!   The servers are friendly. The place is clean. I even stuck my head in the kitchen and it was spotless.  Do yourself a favor, eat a Tres Rios soft taco! If you don't like it, I will pay for your meal (jk).  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had fish and steak tacos, both were good but the fish were my favorite with the hand made  taco shells. The chips and salsa were fun with 3 different salsas and 3 different colored chips. Great margaritas too. I'll come back."}
{"text":"This place is great! It's open late and the food is great. It is clean and efficient. I didn't think I was feeling Mexican food, but as soon as I stepped into this restaurant I was craving Mexican food. Our waiter was very nice, too."}
{"text":"Incredibly pleasant and welcoming staff. Came in to get take out and ended up having a cocktail at the bar while I waited. Awesome margaritas! Food came out quickly and the ingredients were fresh and delicious. Hostess was very nice and gave great recommendations on what I should get."}
{"text":"Our first visit.  My husband had the pork belly tacos and I tried the quesadilla stack.  He said tacos were 7/10, but I really like mine.   Margarita was excellent!  The interior is very well done.   We hope they are very successful!"}
{"text":"Would not come back.   Drinks: I ordered the \"Blast Furnace\" margarita since I am a baby and only drink sweet low alcohol mixed drinks. Well this was delicious and sweet but had not a DROP of tequila in it, though it's supposed to be a tequila mixed drink... at a restaurant that calls itself a \"tequila bar\". BF had a beer and had no complaints.  Dining: We were not offered or given water, and we had a sit down meal at a booth! Only given a single flimsy paper napkin each, and this is a place that serves tacos which are obviously a bit messy to eat. My boyfriend liked the tacos but went through the sole napkin in 3 seconds. He did note that the lamb was a little tough. I got the yucca fries without chorizo (as this menu does not have a single vegetarian option...not even a vegetarian salad available, like wtf). The fries were served in a little bucket thing lined with paper. However these fries are drizzled with cheese sauce which immediately soaked through the paper lining and I spent the whole time trying not to eat shredded paper. Not to mention, there was practically no cheese sauce on it, which was a shame because it was the only flavorful part of the dish.   Overall okay flavors but poorly executed delivery. They need to get the basics down (give us water, napkins, and alcohol in our mixed drinks) before I'd ever come back."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim as we were driving aroumd from the day. Atmosphere was cool and the kids loved the lucha libre mask photos. The food was really good. All the meats from the nachos were sweet and the guacamole was amazing. The drinks were sub par at best. Watered down with little taste. Overall good place. Fyi they do not offer a military discount."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were amazing!!! Great customer service as well. Highly recommend!! I had a delicious chicken burrito and my husband had the duck tacos. The fresh guacamole had just the right taste!"}
{"text":"Good authentic Mexican food definitely good for lunch or dinner the guacamole is delicious and the margaritas are just strong enough. Me and my fiancé Really enjoyed our Time dining at this restaurant we will certainly be coming here again. The service was great and staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Fish Tacos at Tres Rios this weekend....  They were very tasty.  Looking forward to going back to try the \"Street\" and Pork belly Tacos....  Staff was friendly and attentive to our needs and time-frame..  I would like to see a sample option were you can try various Tacos (i.e. Duck, Pork Belly.....).    Definitely going back for more."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! It's my go to spot for real authentic Mexican food.. the guacamole is fire!!! The guacamole you will taste. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. The environment is real low key which I loved."}
{"text":"only giving 3 stars because of a lack of lunch menu.  As a person who works in southside, dining choices are abundant.  The food here is good, but not 12-15 dollar lunch good.  They need a lighter menu with some lunch choices with 2 tacos instead of 3, etc.  Also, with all the jicama on the menu in their salsa, i'd love to see an appetizer plate of jicama with lime and chili powder on the \"lighter fare\" menu :)  Good place to hang out with friends, trendy upscale appearance and good variety on the menu.  I know this isn't Bea's or Las Palmas, but they do need some less costly lunch items."}
{"text":"Went here twice. Liked it both times. I got the barbacoa tacos and the pork belly tacos. Their taco shells are corn tortillas. I'm not sure what they do to them, but they have a different texture and I like it."}
{"text":"So far, so good. Stopped here on a Saturday night (love South Side in the summer without all of the craziness)... we didn't come in this time for food outside of some chips and guacamole which were 'OK' at best.  We did try a couple of their cocktails including a tequila old fashioned and the margarita special, both of which were fantastic. We found out after the fact that they do margarita flights which we'll be sure to try on our next visit if they're still available.  I've heard good things about their tacos, but it'll have to wait until our next visit to give them a try."}
{"text":"Trendy urban concept with decent food falls a little short with atmosphere: I had been looking forward to trying Tres Rios from the moment I saw the sign go up over the summer. I finally got the chance this week when I stopped in with one of my friends for dinner.   Despite the fact that it totally lures you in with its signage out front, I was a little disappointed when we first got inside. While the decor was fun - think paintings of big pop art tacos on the walls - it was super bright in there and sort of gave the feel of a chain-y family restaurant. Diners were dressed VERY casual and it wasn't overly packed despite some of the hype.   We sat in the bar area which was lit equally as bright, but found that the menu items seemed to be pretty progressive, interesting dishes. Things were beginning to look up. To start, we shared an order of salsa which came with three types to choose from and each sampled a different cocktail off the list. My elderflower rosemary infused beverage was totally delicious, and I really enjoyed 2/3 of the salsas that came with the order. For dinner, my options as a vegetarian were a little limited, but I went with the roasted beet and goat cheese tacos. I can be picky when it comes to beets but these tacos were awesome and I shamelessly ate every bite of the order of three. We concluded with another round of drinks and all in all, we were decently happy with how the meal turned out.   As we left, we couldn't help but note that the urban vibey menu items were totally inconsistent with the family feel of the restaurant. In my opinion, turn down the lights, hire a fun staff and play some music to turn it around. The food is already there!"}
{"text":"I just tried Tres Rios for the first time.  The food was really good, although not as authentic Mexican as I had hoped.  Still very flavorful and delicious though.  The service was really, REALLY great.  Sandra was our server and she was excellent.  I recommend this restaurant wholeheartedly."}
{"text":"There are so many taco places opening up in Pittsburgh and if you want to be on top you have to step up your game Tres Rios.  We went on a Friday night and were seated right away by a friendly host. Our waitress was great and the food and drinks came out very quickly.  The  happy hour special was pretty disappointing and the house margaritas were $6. I don't really call that a special but we ordered two and they were very tasty.  Another thing that they really need to do is give out free chips and salsa or for a very minimum price ($2-$4).  The only option was an appetizer of 3 salsas with chips for $8.  We really didn't want to pay for all of that but I am glad we tried out their 3 salsas which were mediocre.  For my entrée I went with the chicken tacos.  They do not come with cheese and I had to pay an extra $1 to get cheese on my tacos which I was not very pleased about. The portions are great and the presentation of the entrees is excellent.  My 3 tacos were served with a side of salsa and green rice.  The taco shells were different. What I liked is that they were sturdy and did not fall apart and also very fresh. What I didn't  like was they were greasy.  My husband ordered a burrito which was served with a side salad. He was very pleased with his choice and the salad had a nice light, lime dressing."}
{"text":"All we wanted to do was grab a few drinks and apps and sit by the window for some Sunday people watching instead we got kicked out of the bar area for a yelp elite event and told we had to sit in the  booths towards the back. Then we where completely forgotten about! They are trying to hard to make the elite happy that they are saying screw you to the others. If you can't take care of them properly while trying to be open then shut down and show that you are only a one trick pony. We paid and left while still having empty glasses and plates all over our table never saw any staff on the \"public side\" of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and very artfully served. Our only complaint, and all three of us noticed it, was how greasy the food was. I ordered the beet tacos with goat cheese (and a nice mix of slaw and other toppings) and they were delicious, but the tortillas were recently dipped in grease and warmed. Totally unnecessary! My niece had the yucca fries and they were oily, even for fries! If they could learn to drain and blot they would easily warrant 4-5 stars."}
{"text":"I found this place from my friend's Instagram story and definitely wanted to try it out. The tacos seem small in size but was actually very filling. All tacos come with a side of cilantro rice and charred tomatillo sauce. I ordered the pork belly tacos and my friend ordered the shrimp tacos. Both tacos were really delicious. I would get them again.   What I was really looking forward to were the yucca fries. They actually didn't come out as I expected (as seen from my friend's instagram picture). Hers were in a basket with what looked like bacon bits and tomatoes and cheese sprinkled on top as extra garnish/flavor. But ours came out with just the fries and the dipping sauce so I asked the server if there were any other fries they served but he said that this was it. So I'm not sure if there are certain days where they serve it a different way or not but I wish they stayed consistent with what people get because it could be misleading. The dipping sauce really was a good addition to the fries.   The restaurant wasn't too busy during the time that we went even though it was prime dinner time so we were seated immediately. And the server was extremely nice and gave us some laughs while we were there. The interior is pretty welcoming too."}
{"text":"I was able to sway my husband into trying this place for an impromptu lunch date.  The space itself is very nice and decorates well.  We decided to get two appetizers and  one entree to share so we could try a variety of things.  We did the guacamole and the nachos as the appetizers and we split a carne asada burrito.  The guacamole was very good - fresh and flavorful, with a little bit of spice, but not too much.  The nachos were really good and a rather large portion was provided.  In fact, we probably didn't need the bur rito.  The nachos had three different meats - chicken, lamb and pork belly.    In the time it took me to finish this review, I went back for a second visit, this time ordering the Shrimp Fajitas.  Once again, a very large portion!  I have liked everything that we have ordered so far.    It would be nice for some outdoor dining & some of the servers need to familiarize themselves with the menu a bit, but that should improve with time.   I will be definately be back."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, but after eating there I wouldn't go back.  The food has way too much sauce on it.  The fajitas we got were practically sitting in a soup when they came out."}
{"text":"Another Southside 'restaurant' (I use the term loosely because in my opinion, the slop they serve doesn't qualify them as a restaurant) to avoid. Probably was a bad idea to visit on May 5th, but it wasn't my decision.   One meal was fish tacos (see pic)...more like mushy half cooked fish sticks jammed into some sort of chewy flavorless fried dough. Definitely was not a hard or soft taco shell. The person who ordered this took one bite and pushed it away.  Another meal, steak tacos, came out several minutes after the other two dishes, so we all sat there uncomfortably waiting for everybody to get their food.   I had the taco salad which was supposed to be on tortillas. The 'tortillas' were similar to that used for the taco and tasted like stale salt free saltine crackers, but greasy (they had been deep fried).   Overall, a disappointing experience. The only thing that tasted good was the Modelo Especiale."}
{"text":"Of all the new Mexican places to open on the Southside this place crushes even lapalapa as far as quality goes. They have some kind of homemade corn shell for the tacos that are amazing and super sturdy. Pork belly tacos are served with an actual slab of belly in each one, not braised and shredded...nice!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here (5/22).  Overall, this place has good food.  I got the Pato Tacos which was a pulled duck.  It was yummy!! The ambiance was nice and relaxing!  It was nicely decorated, with a modern hipster motif.  Now let's get to the reason the didn't get a 5th star....the drinks!!  I had a feature drink Elderflower Margarita which was served in a martini glass. It was NOT great.  My sister got the Blue Curaçao Cow it tasted like straight alcohol.  It wasn't mixed well.  Then she got a frozen strawberry margarita... it tasted just like the Daily's  version we make at home.  Sad thing is I think mine are better.  I assume there bartender or mixologist is fairly new to the game.  Over time, he/she will have the alcohol ratio perfect eventually.  Our waitress was amazing polite and friendly.  You will definitely receive great customer service!!! In conclusion, this place it's GREAT FOR FOOD but if your looking for a good margarita stick with Mad Mex or where ever else you go.  Until next time... hope to see you here for great eats!!"}
{"text":"Tres Rios felt like a chain to me. I know that the owners also own a local Mexican Restaurant chain, but overall, I didn't feel like Tres Rios really stood out in any way. Considering how flooded Pittsburgh is with taco/Mexican restaurants, I was kind of expecting something to set them apart. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. Even when comparing to their parent restaurant, Emiliano's, Tres Rios is kind of the smaller, more limited version.   The hubby got tacos and I got fajitas. They lacked flavor and were simply nothing special. I most likely won't return for the food, but possibly will return for the drinks!"}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place because Emiliano's is soooo good. At first glance, it has a super trendy vibe. I can see it being a cool place to go for happy hour, but the food left me wanting something a little more. Our table got the mild gauc and chips as an appetizer. It was good, but nothing to write home about.The chips were a little too think for my taste, but they were still decent.  For my main dish, I got the chicken torta. It was good, but there was something missing. I liked the combination of chicken, pork belly, cheese and avocado, but it wasn't as flavorful as I would have expected.   All in all, I was disappointed but I wouldn't be opposed to trying it again. Maybe they need to work out a few kinks. Every taco deserves a second chance!"}
{"text":"Love their authentic tacos and thirst quenching drinks. Finally somewhere to get great Mexican that puts Steel Cactus to shame! Would recommend to anyone any day! The margaritas are yummy and refreshing as well!"}
{"text":"Got to go from here last night. I said absolutely no cilantro to the person twice, along with no cilantro rice... got home, not only was it loaded with cilantro and cilantro rice to the point where I had to deconstruct my taco and pick it out and try so salvage my dinner but they also did not put the cheese on my husbands taco!!!!! No cheese? Who does that!! I'm so fed up with these places not being able to follow the most simple requests. Thanks for taking my money and not giving me what i ordered. Is this your normal practice, to not follow orders? To not give the customer what they ordered? NEWSSSSSS FLASH, there's a group of people that have a gene in their body that makes cilantro taste like soap and causes a chemical reaction in their body, unbelievable. OR6A2 gene, look it up."}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal there, a very creative taco menu ( lamb tacos / duck tacos, etc) nicely presented, great wait staff, and the food was excellent. I went there as a suggestion from a friend, expecting a normal taco joint.....far from it, will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I was blown away by how amazing the food and the drinks were! It was obvious that there was a good attention to detail when it came to the ingredients. From the handmade tortillas to the in house syrups and margaritas! The whole time I felt welcomed and included like I was at a family dinner! Loved the staff and definitely plan on becoming a regular! I recommend the picante Paloma and the spicy passion fruit margarita!!! Great atmosphere and good party/ celebration additude!  #3RMardiGras #goingagain #newfavorite"}
{"text":"First got interested in trying this place after sampling their entry in the south side soup contest. Their soup (corn truffle with toasted pumpkin seeds) was amazing!   I really liked it here! We started with the Yucca bowl which is a must try. Yucca are like fries that don't make you hate yourself after eating a giant serving of them. All of the toppings were generous and awesome and we probably could have filled up on this alone.   I'm glad a didn't though because the pork belly tacos were to die for! I especially loved the shell -- perfect mix of crunchy and chewy but stayed together. Obviously very fresh. The inside of the taco was really good too. The portion was just enough after the yucca bowl -- but might have left me wanting for more without and appetizer.   Also delicious were the drinks! I had the pomegranate jalepeno (i think) margarita and it was really unique and delicious. Perfect for sipping. BF on the other hand sucked down the winter pear margarita in about three seconds flat -- which is a little too quickly for a $10 drink in my opinion but he was paying so who am I to judge?"}
{"text":"After mixed reviews about Tres Rios, I was pleasantly surprised with my experience there! My boyfriend visited here for lunch before and absolutely loved it, and a friend of mine came when it first opened and didn't love it so much. After much consideration I'm going to have to side with Chris on this one- sorry, Tori!   Chris, myself, and another couple came here on a rainy Saturday late afternoon- early evening for some drinks and dinner. There were a few other people sitting at the bar, but other than that we were the only people in there. We were greeted right away by our waitress who was very nice and informed us of any specials that they were having. Lucky for me, the passion fruit spicy margarita was a special for the day which made my drink decision quick and easy! The rest of our table stuck with beer as their drinks.   The menu at Tres Rios is pretty simple and to the point. I stuck with my favorite- chicken tacos as my meal, the boys ordered the carne asada tacos and my friend ordered the shrimp salad. Everyone raved about their meals! Each taco meal comes with 3 tacos and a side of rice and salsa. Their taco shells are amazing and you can tell that they were made in house. Their meals are generous serving for a great price. The atmosphere inside of Tres Rios is super clean and has a good vibe, and I felt the same way about the service here. I will 100% be back!"}
{"text":"Lovely interior, kind staff, the food LOOKED so aesthetically pleasing... but it was so bland!   We got an appetizer of nachos which comes with chicken, lamb, and pork belly (we ordered without pork belly, personal preference) and they were great. Not typically a fan of nachos but they put a lot of meat on it and melted queso so it wasn't just mostly plain chips.  The chicken tacos however were seriously lacking flavor. Toppings on the taco only included (a lot) of onions and some cilantro and parsley. No sauces. And the chicken didn't have much seasoning so I felt like I was eating an onion taco :( the barbacoa tacos were better. The rice that came on the side was also incredibly flavorless so it wasn't eaten.   Expected a lot more from this place but didn't meet my expectations :/"}
{"text":"Excellent food! We got the pork belly tacos and the chicken fajita. We really liked the tortillas as well. Solid pricing for being on the Southside. Very good dinner for two with drinks under $50."}
{"text":"We had an early bird Sunday dinner here after seeing a movie a couple of weeks ago.  My husband saw some pictures online of some duck tacos and he knows how I feel about each of those separately so suggested we give this a try.    It wasn't very busy, which is a bonus especially in South Side which can be overrun with people on the weekends.  We sat at the bar and met the bartender/waitress that told us of some drink specials.  We mauled over some drinks and took to perusing the menu.  I was teetering between fish or Pato (duck) tacos or the Pato fajitas.  I decided to try the fajitas.  We waited a while to place our order, as the bartender was busy in the corner seemingly counting money and food tickets.  Once she say we were ready she took our orders quickly and not too long after the food arrived.  My fajitas came piping hot in a cast iron skillet.  The duck was a little on the greasy side as were the many vegetables in the pan.  Maybe a little heavy on the oil.  Also the duck vs vegetables ratio was a bit skewed.  This does seem pretty common though when ordering fajitas.  The fresh corn tortillas were really good, however small and it would have been impossible to complete my meal with the three small tortillas they provided so I asked for more.  To my surprise I was charged for them.  Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised, I just wished I was informed on the upcharge.      Accompanying my fajitas was cilantro rice, black beans,  Pico de Gallo and sour cream.  I asked for everything to be on the side and separated, to which they graciously accommodated my request.  The sides were on point.  I absolutely loved the Pico de Gallo, which featured jicama.  It was perfectly seasoned and I could have eaten a bowl of it.  Very fresh and appetizing.  The rice and beans were also quite nicely flavored and not your typical run of the mill rice and beans you expect from Mexican restaurants.  The meal was quite nice though not sure I would get the fajitas again but my husband's tacos looked very tasty.  I think I would go that route next time.  One disappointing factor, no free chips and salsa.  I think adding at least one bowl of complimentary chips and salsa is essential to Mexican restaurants everywhere.  Good add to the South Side scene."}
{"text":"Meh...This place needs work, but it is still new, so I will give them a chance.  We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was nearly dead.  We were seated at a booth directly against the one other party of 4 eating here that day, so being able to listen to their conversation took the place of the lack of music playing.  It was bright and while there was music playing at one point, it stopped completely and the only thing to hear were the other diners and loud bartenders behind the bar.  I will say that their margarita was absolutely delicious..and I don't normally do margaritas.  I ordered a Dos XX Amber and Bobby got their Winter Pear marg.  It was honestly amazing!  We started with the $8 chips and salsa appetizer (I hate when places don't give complimentary chips and salsa but whatever) and the chips were fresh and crisp and all 3 salsas were very good, albeit being in 1/2 cup serving dishes.  I ordered the chicken fajitas for my meal and Bobby ordered the pork belly tacos.  The tacos were very different!!! They had a good texture, crisp but chewy and the meat was tender inside.  Not a whole lot of toppings.  It came with cilantro rice that had absolutely 0 flavor.  My chicken fajitas were basically a chicken breast sliced on top of a bed of onions and peppers.  Not much seasoning that I could tell.  There was sour cream, but no salsa (?.....seriously..?) and it came with beans and the flavorless rice.  Three corn tortillas were provided, but they were useless because they crumbled as soon as you tried to fold the fixings inside of them. I ended up just adding a ton of hot sauce and salsa from Bobby's plate to the chicken and peppers and eating them with my fork.  Really lacking the flavor in that dish.  I'd probably try tacos next time.  All in all, I think this place has really good potential - the interior is really neat and the bar is beautiful and from the small bit I have tried so far, they have good drinks.  Ambience and food need some work, though."}
{"text":"Shawn is awesome. Food, vibe, choices are fantastic. Shawn is awesome. Food, vibe, choices are fantastic. Shawn is awesome. Food, vibe, choices are fantastic. Shawn is awesome. Food, vibe, choices are fantastic. Shawn is awesome. Food, vibe, choices are fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in one day as I saw that this place was a new joint and wanted to see how it was (and bring it more publicity if it was a good place). Was greeted by two waitresses who were friendly and were prompt in service. Though I ended up doing takeout because I wanted to try the tacos here (bought pork belly and pato tacos to go), I had a nice long chat with the waitresses while waiting for my order. From first impressions, the place is a gorgeous place to dine with a lot of seats and a nice bar to boot. Now as for the food, the tacos were generally pretty good. The shells were definitely corn (not really sure if the shell should be considered hard or soft, but I'm leaning towards hard since it probably softened while I was on the way home), but they went along nicely with the taco meats. Now as for the meats, I personally found the duck meat to be a little on the dry side, but the pork belly was decent and tasted just as advertised. In general, the tacos are fresh and the ingredients used are great. Each taco set also comes with Mexican rice, which I actually found to be quite delicious even if it was a rather simple recipe. Prices are reasonable, food is good. I'll definitely be giving this place another go sometime down the road, either with trying more taco varieties or other items on the menu ... may even try the bar at some point. Definitely worth a try for those on the fence. A most welcome addition to the South Side."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! Came here when a few other go to places in south side were packed. It's not the cheapest food but the ambiance is nice. Basically the menu consists of tacos, which come in orders of 3 for $11-14ish. That seems like a fair price when compared to the other fancy taco places. I do wish they would let you either buy tacos individually or mix and match. My table ended up doing some crazy swapping so we could try the various meats. Think the consensus was the carne asada and carnitas were the favorite. We also tried the duck and the pork belly. The tortilla is amazing. I didn't try any of the margaritas this time but they looked good. Hope they come up with a happy hour, because it's still hard to justify some of the crazy taco prices that have seemed to pop up in the burgh!"}
{"text":"Ick.  This food is awful.  I gave an extra star because they have a cool vibe/ambiance.  But there's no way I would order food here again.   There are pretty much no vegetarian options.  The beet/goat cheese tacos are the only option for a meal.  Some of the sides are vegetarian, so maybe you could cobble a meal together, but don't plan on a salad (no veg options there either).  The filling of the beet tacos was fine (beets, goat cheese, corn, dry slaw), but nothing spectacular.  But the taco shell--my god, the shell--was disgusting!  It looks like it was homemade, but tasted like fish!  Like a flattened, oily fish sandwich.  It was one of the grossest things I've ever eaten.  I ended up scraping out the insides so I didn't have to eat that vile concoction.  My husband ordered meat tacos and also did not like the shell.  All tacos come with green (cilantro) rice, which was kind of boring.  The yucca fries, which have been raved about in other reviews, were edible, but nothing i would order again.  On the plus side, our server was cool.  I'm not sure where you should be eating in this neighborhood, but pass on this one."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best margarita I have ever had is the seasonal winter pear.  It's like Christmas and freshly fallen snow and ice skaters and a roaring fire all wrapped up in a glass with tequila.  It's a must.    Turns out, the food is pretty darn good as well.  I had the Mexicuban - which is a Mexican take on the classic Cuban sandwich and it was delicioso!  Great bread, which makes or breaks a Cuban, awesome meats and a side of chips and their amazing roasted tomato salsa."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I really, really, wanted to like this place.   I live close to the Southside and am always excited when a new restaurant opens here. On a beautiful Sunday night after running errands and working on school work, my boyfriend and I decided to check out this new joint and unwind. We loved the atmosphere and the bartender provided us with very friendly and attentive service. We both started off with a presidente beer, which was the special for that evening. It was pretty tasty.  For our meals, I ordered the shrimp tacos with yucca fries and my boyfriend ordered their chicken tacos with coleslaw. You receive 3 tacos per order and you can mix and match sides with your tacos for no extra charge. The yucca fries were cooked properly and weren't bad (definitely not my favorite in comparison to regular potato fries) but it was the sauce that came with them that really stood out as disappointing. There was literally no flavor to the sauce at all. I believe it was supposed to be spicy, but it was not. It tasted like nothing. I added a significant amount of hot sauce from the table to the sauce in order to make it a little tastier. My tacos were ok, but they weren't super great. The shrimp was the cheap, tiny kind, which aren't as flavorful or as juicy as the larger shrimp. To compensate for that, there was a ton of slaw and sauce on my tacos, which made them taste pretty good. The tortillas looked homemade, but again, had no flavor. My boyfriend's chicken tacos were, again, lacking flavor. He added a significant amount of hot sauce and other sauce to the tacos to give them some love. The slaw was also bland.   Again, the service was great and we had a good time people watching while enjoying a beer. But the food itself was less than \"a-ok\"- it was extremely bland, which is very disappointing for Mexican. I say, come here for a beer, but don't expect to be blown away by the food."}
{"text":"Had dinner on a Wednesday night, got seated quickly.  Food and drinks were great!  Got chips and salsa and fish and chicken tacos that were delicious.  Cocktails were really good too!  Liked this place a lot, will def be going back."}
{"text":"Tres Rios is a nice addition to the Southside! The place is larger than I expected, with both a bar area and the 'dining room area'. We went on one of the first weekends it was open and it was early on a Saturday night, there were still 4 - 5 other groups there so it was nice to see they are doing steady business. I was ready for higher prices from the other reviews, but for the margarita and the guac and chips, it was well worth it! The guac had great flavor and comes with two bowls, perfect for sharing! The spicy passionfruit margarita was perfect! I've been places where the \"spicy margaritas\" have no spice - this delivered!   We also ordered the pork belly tacos. They had a nice flavor, but I'm not sure I would get them again. I am excited to go back when I am hungrier and try the Beet tacos - those sounded great!   I'm sure I will be back again for drinks and the guac! Welcome to the Southside, Tres Rios!"}
{"text":"It's pretty expensive for what it is but at least it has a good beer selection. If you want great Mexican just go not even five minutes down the road to La Palapa. It's smaller and they don't serve alcohol, but the food is better, cheaper and you can BYOB."}
{"text":"This is a cool modern Mexican restaurant with good service.  They have burritos, tacos,  enchiladas and other Mexican food.   I ordered the steak burrito with empenadas... it was delicious. I also had a spicy pomegranate Margarita which was REALLY spicy.  I'd like to go back to try more."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best tacos in Pittsburgh!  The tortillas are hand made so they are crispy and tender at the same time.  Everything I have tried is flavorful.  Drinks are fantastic.  Nice modern atmosphere.  My daughter and husband like it just as much.  Can get crowded on weekends so go early."}
{"text":"Excellent and unique food and margaritas.  Try their duck tacos and Frida Kahlo margarita.  Nice decor and friendly staff.   Reasonable prices, even better at Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"The experience I had with Tres Rios was awesome. I had lamb and duck tacos along with chicken quesadilla, fire! The watermelon margarita is good on a hot day along with a drink that was made with hot peppers. It starts off sweet then it hits you with a spicy kick. The bartender makes good drinks and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I am most definitely going back. 5 Stars and a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I tried this place when it first opened and it was amazing. The margaritas were so creative and were so good. They were a little on the pricey side but they were worth it. I ordered the beet tacos and they were amazing! I went back a second and third time but the tacos just didnt live up to the first time. The tortilla were soggy and the beets were not sweet at all. I will definitely give this place another try in the future."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner and Friday and it was fairly disappointing. First off the interior is pretty nice and well put together. We sat at the bar and got a few drinks. The margaritas weren't very good. We then had guacamole which was pretty good. I got the shrimp fajitas and it was pretty bland. I wouldn't get that again. She ordered the beet tacos and she hated them. The bill was also very big. I don't really see us going back for any reason. There were a few good things about this lave but not enough to go again. It was disappointing."}
{"text":"I am going to first of start by saying I love Long Island Ice Teas they are one of my favorite drinks and this was one of the best long islands I have had, equal parts liquor with coke and sweet and sour.  I also got the wet burrito with steak and it came with a side of fresh lettuce tossed with a salsa citrus dressing which was very fresh I loved it, it offset and equaled out the heat from the burrito.  My steak was very tender and everything was seasoned well there was no need for me to add salt.  Very authentic Mexican food true to the culture with a Pittsburgh twist on some of the menu items.  I really like the atmosphere it's very upbeat but calming makes you feel welcome and comfortable. Staff was very nice and never missed a beat I never had to ask for anything.  Looking forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"Tres Rios was a decent taco joint. Loved the decor. Service was great. Started with the chips and salsa. I like that they give you 3 different salsas. All 3 salsas were fresh and delicious. The chips were also fresh.  My husband and I split the fish tacos and carne asada tacos. Both were good but nothing over the top. The carne asada tacos were pretty basic, I think would be better with a little more toppings. The fish tacos were a bit better, really liked the sauce on them. Also the taco shells were house made and fresh.  I do wish that the tacos came in singles instead of 3 to an order that way you can try a couple different tacos instead of only being able to order 1 type and getting 3 of that style.  Overall Tres Rios is decent but definitely not my favorite Pittsburgh taco joint."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice now. It's authenitic and trendy. The staff is super friendly and accommodating especially our favorite waitress Sandra! The food is delicious and with hand crafted elements like the yummy tortillas. Delicious drinks too!"}
{"text":"This is easily the best Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh proper..they've managed to put together a concise menu of familiar though elevated dishes.  Highly recommend the Barbacoa Burrito! -GF loves the Shrimp salad..  Can't go wrong with their fresh salsas, tacos margaritas, etc  Im a bit baffled by the comments of two \"elite\" reviewers who only gave 2 stars..would love to know which Mexican places they actually enjoy."}
{"text":"If you hate free chips and salsa, then this is the place for you. Really nice atmosphere and the spicy dragon fruit margarita is pretty good! Staff was nice. The food is just ok. If you're in the area, it's worth checking out but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"I went to Tres Rios opening night and I can honestly say I will be a repeat customer. It's definitely NOT your typical authentic Mexican restaurant, so please don't go in with the assumption that you're going to get free chips and salsa and expect to pay a bit more for really phenomenal food. Think \"tako\" downtown or \"Round Corner Cantina\" & \"Smoke Taqueria\" in Lawrenceville.   I had the Winter Pear Margarita which is not your typical \"on the rocks or frozen\" beverage. I really wasn't expecting to come in there and see a \"Steel Cactus\" style margarita... because they're not the Steel Cactus. The Apple Pear Margarita was made with a pretty strong, fancy tequila (lol can you tell I don't really drink tequila?), pear, cinnamon, and clove.  To eat, the table shared Yucca Fries and if you've ever watched the Food Network, you know that this is a typical side dish found in Latin America so this isn't your typical Mexican restaurant side. I also had the Pato (duck) Tacos to eat. It was made with a jicama slaw!!!!! And, get this, the cilantro rice on the side was actually green which just means the cilantro wasn't an afterthought added to the rice once it was cooked ... it was actually blended with lime and oil and cooked into the rice. This is what every recipe calls for so I got really pumped to see it on my plate.  The atmosphere is extremely cool. My server was super fun. Their Instagram account makes me drool and laugh at the same time. Their prices were fair compared to everything downtown and in L-ville. Reasonable for a more upscale restaurant and bar in Southside, too.    TLDR: Love. Please don't go in there expecting it to be a sombrero-wearing, mariachi playing, free chips and large strawberry margarita on the rocks restaurant. Expect to hear the latest hits and get a little buzz from a strong but delicious fancy cocktail. Prepare to stuff your face with pork belly tacos and shrimp ceviche. If you go in with this mindset, you won't be disappointed and you'll likely end up there for a few hours lol"}
{"text":"My partner and I were looking for a quick bite to eat. As we were driving down south side we saw this small store front for Tres Rios. We decided to give it a chance, and we could haven't been happier with our decision. The server was very warm, friendly, quick to wait on us, and answer our questions. For the entrees I got the Roberto Clemente. The bbq sauce was amazing. The meat was super tender. My partner got the a pollo burrito. Again, the meat was super tender and full of flavor. The sauce that was served with the meal was signature and made in house. The bartender working there had never made a miami vise and it was my first time trying it. He made it to perfection. His will be hard to beat anywhere. He used a syrup made from fresh muddled strawberries. We will definitely be frequenting this establishment in the future."}
{"text":"Perfect carne asada taco.   I've lived in Texas and Mexico. This place is just as good or better than any place I've been. Authentic, savory, pleasant and kind staff. Super legit."}
{"text":"YEAH BABY!  This place is great.  The bar and restaurant are really nice inside, and the bartender was super friendly and helpful.  The spicy passionfruit margarita is excellent, and I cannot wait to be contigo with one again.  The guacamole is the stuff dreams are made of, and I'm not sitting in my cubicle fantasizing about it.  I had the pork belly tacos, which were good but so rich I could only have one.  : /  My friend had the beef and yucca burrito, and he wouldn't have if it were polite to steal other peoples food--bc I wanted to steal his dinner.  They were so good.  The restaurant has a great atmosphere and decor and the owner and waitstaff were all incredibly friendly.  I will absolutely be back"}
{"text":"I went to Tres Rios last night with friends after hearing rave reviews. I LOVED IT! The atmosphere was trendy and the food & drinks were innovative. I ordered two margaritas- the Picante Paloma, which was made with grapefruit soda & jalapeño syrup, and the Roasted Red Pepper, which is made with the namesake's syrup and garnished with a salt & charred jalapeño rim. Both were SO delicious and I was shocked at how amazing the red pepper one was. Imagine a Bloody Mary but with a slight fresh pepper taste than tomato. The menu wasn't extremely extensive but there was something for everyone, no matter if you're adventurous or not. I ordered the Burrito Mojado with pato (duck) & it's covered in an ancho chile & cheese sauce. It was one of the best burritos I've ever had! The duck was so tender and had the best flavor. It was accompanied with a cilantro spring mix salad which was delicious as well! Will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place and had heard great things.  Unfortunately the experience did not match up to the hype.  I'm very surprised to see the high rating.  The place does have a pretty cool atmosphere and our service was good.  Those are the only two compliments I can really think of though.  For appetizers we got the chips and salsa.  It came with two different salsas, pico, and we also ordered the queso.  For some reason the queso is not on their menu, but they do have it.  Both salsas were very average.  They did not have any real flavor.  The pico was also nothing special.  The queso was good but I've had much better.  For our meals I ordered fish tacos and my wife ordered chicken tacos.  I could barely taste the ingredients of my tacos because the bland corn shells were so much that it overpowered everything.  When I tried the fish tacos with just my fork I was not impressed either.  Again, just very little flavor.  I tried my wife's chicken tacos and they were very dry.  They definitely were in need of some sort of sauce.    With so many good Mexican options in Pittsburgh, I would definitely not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ugh, just okay. An interesting spin on Mexican cuisine, just not that great. Portions are small. Up side is this place has a nice beer selection. More of an apps stop, not a meal."}
{"text":"We stopped in while on a walk down e. carson. The sign for this place has been up for awhile and we were eager to try a tequila bar. As of now they have a little under 30 tequilas. They are doing a soft opening. A grand opening is happening next week and afterwards the number of tequilas on hand will double.   The menu offered fajitas, burritos, enchiladas and tacos as well as other Mexican food and apps. They offered a great mix of cocktails and margaritas. Pricing was a little  more than average at about $12-15 an entree. Tacos were offered by 3 and were $12.  The decor is cute and the restraurant offers both tables and booths. The music offered was a mix of top hits, both newer and older.   We just wanted to test the waters since we had already had dinner. We ordered fried ice cream. It was ok. After ordering we read the description and found it had different choices for toppings such as honey, chocolate or strawberry. Our server didn't ask us what we wanted. I believe it came out topped with chocolate.   Anyways def not a bad spot. Service and atmosphere was nice. I bet on a Friday night its gonna be a cool spot.  If I could offer a tip it would be to offer chips and salsa. That makes it more legit, right? Lol"}
{"text":"After mad mex stopped making the chicken torta I found this place.  It also is close to my work. I got that and chips and salsa!  The sandwich was great but no salsa was given with the chips which really bummed me out as I'm already back to work and can't go back. If they didn't forget the salsa it would be 5/5"}
{"text":"Really good but a bit pricey. Great selection of drinks - beers on tap, bottles, and margaritas. Plenty of options on the menu as well. Went with my boyfriend and sat at the bar. We ordered 2 Corona's, homemade guacamole ($10) [delicious], pork belly tacos (~$12) [very good!], carne asada tacos (~$12) [awesome!], and the yucca fries [never had before but good]. Our bill was $51 and change. Their taco shells are homemade and unlike anything I've ever had - a mix between soft and hard - VERY GOOD! The bartenders were all very friendly and informative. We will go back again!"}
{"text":"Seriously, I really don't get it. I think Chichi's was more authentic at least more flavorful. I had their taco salad, which was essentially chicken on lettuce and that's it. And, the chicken looked like Buffalo chicken! I kinda wished it was because it was so bland.   I guess if you want schtick and drinks, ok. But for food? Go down the street to Doce or La Palapa (which has more authentic ambiance anyways)."}
{"text":"This guac is on fiiiiire. No, really, the guac is excellent. But who the hell charges $8 for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant? Everyone knows that's simply a reward for rolling the dice and walking through the door. If it wasn't for the excellent service and friendly manager checking on our table, I would have questioned my decision. Oddly enough, the drinks were unique and semi-affordable. Just can't comprehend how you can charge the same for an appy as you do for a main course. Gimme a happy hour & free chips/salsa and we'll talk. You can find me at the tequila bar all day, every day. SALUD."}
{"text":"Went here over the weekend and had the best service I have had in Pittsburgh.  The food is largely what you would expect- a Pittsburgh versioning of Tex mex.  I had the pulled pork burrito and it was Pretty good."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic restaurant. My husband and I went on a Wednesday night for my birthday. It wasn't crowded. Our server was friendly and very informative with the menu items. Our first choice was our drinks...margaritas. i had the elderflower with rosemary and my husband had a spicy one. Both were delicious. We ordered the chips and salsa for our appetizer. It came with three different sauces, all delicious. Our chips were refilled also. Our second margaritas were the winter pear with cinnamon and cloves. Yummy. My entree was the chicken tacos. They were very good and flavorful. The presentation was nice, on a wooden board served with cilantro rice. My husband had a burrito with carne asada. Very good food. To end our night, we had dessert...friend ice cream. This was definitely the most delicious I have ever had. Our server was attentive and kind. She even gave us a certificate for yucca fries for our next visit. We will be bringing friends!"}
{"text":"The food was just ok and the prices are a too high for a Mexican restaurant in the Southside.   For two of us to eat there it cost about $60 with tip. We did not order anything special or over the top. Chips and salsa costs $8 (salsa served in the same sized dishes as their condiments). House Margaritas are $10 each for an average size glass (weakly mixed). Fajitas were $14 and burritos were $12.   If you like a $10 weak drink, $8 cover charge (in the form of chips and salsa), and average food then this is the spot for you."}
{"text":"Tres Rios in Pittsburgh turns out to be the most flavorful Mexican food in Pittsburgh. A pleasant surprise!   They use yucca in their appetizers and main courses for a nice play on textures and flavors.   I got the burrito and it was sweet.  Added some in-house hot sauce for a kick off mesquite (I'm from Texas) and that took it from pretty good too pretty damn good! The corn tortillas seemed to be fresh and homemade and were excellent!  Is good in Pittsburgh and are looking for something a bit more \"authentic\" check this place out!"}
{"text":"So far so good!  I really enjoyed the winter pear margarita.  The pescado (fish) tacos were AMAZING. Honestly I don't remember the last time I had one this good in Pittsburgh. The tortillas were handmade and overall the meal tasted fresh and was overall very satisfying. Only thing is I wish I had a bean option that automatically came with the meal-portions seemed a little small.  My boyfriend ordered the barbacoa burrito. It also was amazing!! I'm not sure if I like his or my food better!   I highly recommend checking this place out. I hope this restaurant maintains its quality food and service as it gains popularity."}
{"text":"Great tacos.  A friend and I tried the duck and the pork belly.  If you are torn between these two delicious animals like we were, I would recommend the pork belly.  Nothing wrong with the duck but the pork belly tacos are on another plane of existence."}
{"text":"This place has really delicious tacos and burritos at an awesome price point! The street corn is absolutely delicious, and the wide variety of taco flavors is a plus. I also have to mention that the margaritas are affordable and also pack a punch. The service was fantastic as well. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Tres Rios is the best new restaurant in Pittsburgh! Cool atmosphere, impeccable service and amazing food and drinks! I really loved how the guacamole appetizer was separated into two even (and large) portions so I didn't have to fight over the last scoop with my boyfriend   they also have great drink specials! The rosemary margarita was delish- the perfect amount of sweet and salty, with a little bit of spice. Tres Rios will definitely become a regular spot for me! #3RMardiGras"}
{"text":"Fish tacos almost had no fish, no piccolo de gallo on the sweet side. Shrimp ceviche was good but need more lime."}
{"text":"Had lunch here. Excellent. Will have to try dinner next. Great service. Nice atmosphere. Food prepared with care. Fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Extremely welcoming management. Artistic environment. Great food, I can't stress that enough!! My steak burrito was amazing. Very friendly and clean environment."}
{"text":"I was skeptical of this place knowing that the owners are part of the Emiliano's family. My last few experiences at Emiliano's were not the best. However, I went in with an open mind and I am so glad I did! It was a Sunday and I was with 5 other guests. We perched up at the bar and browsed their drink menu. The special of the day was the roasted red pepper marg and while that sounds iffy, I was intrigued and gave it a shot. The rest of our group got the pear marg, spicy passionfruit and pittsburgh des sol. Roasted red pepper for the win!! Not too sweet but not bitter, just the right balance so it did not taste like a blended pepper over ice. We ordered fresh gauc and the nachos.  The Gauc was tasty but it was hard to tell if it was fresh made in the kitchen or prepped earlier in the day. Meh. The chips were warm and delicate but stiff enough to scoop the gauc. The nachos portion was smaller than expected and the ratio of toppings to chips was off it's game. The triple meat topping was scooped on top when it should have been spread throughout the chips. The flavor was a bit bland so most of our group picked out the chips with cheese and just ate those. A side of salsa would have gone a long way with the nachos. We decided we would not order the nachos again.  Our bartender was very attentive, knowledgeable and kind. She made for a great experience. Along with that and the drinks, I will be back next time I am in the 'Burgh and I'll explore more of their menu :)"}
{"text":"As both a huge taco person and a Southsider, I had high hopes for Tres Rios. The restaurant itself is quite large, and it's  divided into two sections. There's a large bar, and a seated area.   I stopped by a while ago back when the place first opened. I had duck tacos, which came in a set of three. I found the tacos quite small and dry.   I think at that point Tres Rios was still experimenting with the menu, so I'm not sure if something has changed. The presentation was great, and the food looked pretty, but the flavor/combination wasn't anything that particularly stuck out.  Tres Rios isn't bad by any means, but with all the other unique and established taco places on the street, Tres Rios will have to step it up and bring something different to the table."}
{"text":"We had a large group of people so we got many things.  The guacamole and chips were good but the guac needed salt, once we added that it was really good. Chips were fresh, warm, and crispy.   The shrimp ceviche was pretty yummy, maybe a little underseasoned if you didnt make sure to get some of the puree in the bite (the puree was the seasoned part)  Friend said that the Pato (duck) tacos were good but the fact that it was duck was lost, could have been chicken and not made a difference  Fish tacos were good  Beet tacos left something to be desired, the beets needed some kind of seasoning or flavor, the goat cheese was the star of that show but the taco itself was mostly bland  The best tacos of the night were definitely the Pork Belly, the Barbacoa, and the Carne Asada. Those 3 were packed with flavor.   I do wish you could mix and match tacos instead of having to get 3 of the same BUT if you have multiple people in your party you can each order something different and trade like we did.  Pretty good beer selection and drink offerings.  Our waitress was very kind and attentive.   Overall this got 4 instead of 5 stars due to some things being underseasoned.   As we were leaving we could see that someone ordered fajitas and those smelled amazing.   Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I can't say there was anything glaringly wrong with this establishment, however; it's not the first or even third place I would think to go if I was craving Mexican food. The interior is well designed, nice trendy decor. We were seated promptly and our waitress came right over. I ordered shrimp tacos with yucca fries and my boyfriend had the mexicuban. The portions were a little small for the price and my shrimp tacos lacked any sort of stand out flavors. The place was clean and the staff members were very nice but food wise I was not overly impressed."}
{"text":"We came in here for a quiet Monday lunch. Our server Austin was great. He recommended the Blue Salud which was delicious, albeit a bit a strong. We got the shrimp & carne asada fajitas as well as the pollo burrito. All of our meals were delicious. I could have used some guac or sour cream with my fajitas. The salsa that came with the chips & salsa was superb. Also the inside was awesome, great decorations. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We decided to try here after hearing so many friends rave about it. I'm not sure if I'm just missing something but I was not impressed.  The inside decor is festive and fun. I thought we were off to a good start. First, we order the dip trio. Queso is not on the menu- but you can order it. All of the dips left something to be desired. They all lacked flavor and had no spice. The queso was pretty good but I have had better. I had to mix each salsa with queso to get flavor.  I ordered the chicken tacos and rice. I seriously cannot get over this rice. It was white rice. The white rice you get at a Chinese restaurant. Nothing Mexican about it. I'm still so confused. The taco shells are fried which I would not prefer. I am a big fan of dry chicken (yes weird I know), but this taco with this fried shell was SO DRY and flavorless. I piled on one of the blan salsas to get the taco moist, but the flavor was yet to be discovered.   With so many good mexican restaurants around, I do not see myself coming back here. Props for the atmosphere and appearance. Maybe just stop in for happy hour."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here and the margaritas are great!   The vibe is really cool, they obviously put a lot of thought and effort into the decoration.  Got the pear and clove marg, delish.  Also tried the spicy passion fruit which was really good as well.  For lunch I got the shrimp tacos, which I now crave.  I LOVED the tortillas, I'm confused by those that didn't like them.   Swapped out the rice for the yucca fries which are gods gift.  Only annoying thing is chips and salsa are not included and the price to get them is outrageous."}
{"text":"Great Mexican place, new, little pricey but good. First time I had street corn.... words can't even. Wide variety of meats and that. Awesome fried ice cream!!"}
{"text":"Yeah this place is legit.. I'm from Texas and really struggle to find good Authentic Mexican food in the Burgh.. found this place and Bam, hit the spot. I'll be a regular at this place!"}
{"text":"Hitting five stars was super easy. From start to ending of our meal we had a 5 star experience. Love the decor!!!  It's a little dark but has a light blue and orange pops of color. Looks like a combo of vintage meets contemporary. The hostesses were super friendly.  Our server came to the table and introduced himself. Again, super friendly. We started with the salsa sampler. It had tri-color corn chips and three types of salsa-pick, verde, and spicy. The chips and the salsa tasted fresh. A bit of salty ad spicy goodness.  I ordered the shrimp Tacos. The shells are very unique. They are made of corn yet they don't look like a typical corn taco shell. They are still very crispy but don't break into a thousand pieces when you bite into them. The shrimp was grilled nicely. It had a creamy slaw on top. It also came with a side of line and cilantro rice as well as verde salsa. The Tacos were full of flavor as they were but the salsa was a nice addition.  The duck was shredded and moist. It's hands down the best duck taco I have ever had. It had a bit of spice that wasn't overwhelming. It also came with the creamy slaw.  The rice was tasty but I am a lime fiend so I wish there had been a small line wedge to squeeze over it.  I like that the portions aren't huge (though you are getting 3 Tacos). I like that they are aiming for quality not quantity.  I thought the prices matched the level of food being served-duck was $11 and shrimp &13.  They have a side room big enough for a group. It would be a cool place to share dinner with a group of friends.  The manager stopped by the table which was nice.  All in all a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"Tres Rios has tres reasons to go. Drinks. Drinks. Food. This is a bar. I'll probably go back to try one of their main dishes but I often default to tacos if I'm trying a place for the first time.The presentation was nice and it came with a side of rice to justify (not really) the price of the tacos.  $13 isn't awful for 3 tacos and a side. But they need more it needs something. No kick or no outstanding flavor. Nonetheless a decent taco. I had the duck ones. Can't remember exactly what it was called but I uploaded a photo.  The drinks, GOOD. They have all your latin flare drinks, a bunch of cocktails and my favorite michelada. So I was pretty pleased overall. Not to mention the staff was pretty chill. Pretty chill vibes all around. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a prime location to either eat or drink and watch a sports game on tv. We ate at the bar during a recent penguins game and it was great. The guacamole is spicy and has a citrus twist that I did not expect. It's a great spot in the heart of southside that isn't crowded with drunk college kids."}
{"text":"The fish tacos were fantastic, house made corn tortillas, yum! I really enjoyed the cilantro rice and salsa verde that accompanied them, bartender was very personable."}
{"text":"This place had a lot of promise, but quickly took a dive.  Everyone was so friendly when we came in, but the service was soooo slow.  Many of the tables were filled, but there were several waitresses.  A table of four was seated after us and they got their drinks before us and were almost done eating their main dish before we even got ours (we were just a table of 2).  We were never offered water and when we asked, we were done with our chips before we even got the water.  Atmosphere is cool, food was ok, drinks were watered down.  If they could improve their service, add more flavor to their food and improve the quality of drinks, it would be a nice little place."}
{"text":"It looks like just another bar from the outside, but they have some great Mexican food. I had the baracatos tacos and loved them.   I'll definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Cold Dos Equis and some guac... count me in! I have been to Tres Rios a few times now and enjoyed this during both happy hour and dinner time.   The last time we were there it was very quiet with only a few others in the restaurant. The bartender was very helpful in talking through the happy hour options ($2 tacos!) and suggesting what she thought we'd like most.   The guacamole has great flavor and when we've been there to share it they even bring it out in two bowls so we can have our own little portions and not worry about having to try to scarf it down to out-do the other person! Chips are a good level of salty and the drinks have always been good.  Definitely a place to check out on Carson St.!"}
{"text":"First time visitor to this joint on 4/22/18 before seeing Twiddle at the Rex. Ordered the fish tacos... The flavors were great. The amount of fish was skimpy. The tortilla shells were a little thick- homemade? Didn't stop me from eating all 3 of them. Fortunately, my friend had extra spiced crema that I was able to add on to soften them a little. Service was great, food was delivered fast. Would def try them again and can hopefully sample a drink next time."}
{"text":"My friend was in town for a visit and we spent our Saturday night bar hopping on Carson Street. The best stop of the night was Tres Rios! We ordered a side of yucca fries and their version of Street corn. To drink, I had a peach margarita- which was amazing! The bartender was very friendly and made great conversation with us at the beginning of our visit. It was strange that for a Saturday night, there would only be one person responsible for the drinks. She was trying to service the bar and make the drinks for the guests seated at the tables. Several servers would come over and just stare at her and wait for their orders. There was gentleman that seemed to be a manager of sorts, but he didn't help her with the drink orders when they backed up. Because of this, our service at the bar suffered. In the end, the food we ate was delicious and the drinks were amazing. I'll definitely be back with the intention of eating a full meal and spending more time. The decor is also fun!"}
{"text":"This restaurant absolutely was fantastic in every way! I have a couple mexican restaurants that I go to in my hometown, but this place made those seem American. Everything was homemade. My boyfriend and I went and he ordered the fish tacos and I had the steak fajitas. The tortillas were homemade, homemade salsas, chips, pico de gallo, and everything just tasted very fresh. Highly recommend checking this place out, I will be back again, very soon!!"}
{"text":"Being from Texas our choices for Mexican food, or street tacos, are unlimited.  However, this place was absolutely a treat to my fiancé and I.  Being skeptical at first we were pleasantly delighted when our carne asada tacos came out wrapped in a light, crisp homemade corn tortilla. My goodness were they delicious!! Not to mention the guacamole was just as good. Overall this place was awesome and the staff was great too. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The space and atmosphere here is cool. I ordered a red pepper margarita. It was spicy and the flavor of the tequila was superb. I had the pork belly tacos that had a decent sweet candied flavor, but I wasn't a fan of the fat. I would choose something else next time. The house made tortillas were yum. The fajita peppers, salsa, and beans were all good but the meat needed more flavor. I would try other food next time, but it's a cool spot."}
{"text":"I don't know who invented Yinzer Mexican food but I'm okay with it. ? I had a burrito with French fries in it and it changed my life forever.  Not only does this place know flavor but the service here is impeccable. The waiter was proactive and the margaritas were amazing. Honestly after seeing and tasting the burrito with the fries in it (they have a few of them) I was a believer. Also the burrito comes with a small salad and it has sophisticated flavors that I was all \"this isn't a regular salad.\" I almost ordered another salad to go. The price wasn't terrible and even on St. Patrick's Day the wait was manageable. Will I be back? Absolutely! Was this worth every penny? Yup! It didn't hurt that the staff from the hostess to the bartender had a smile and a great attitude."}
{"text":"I came here for an event and was able to sample some of their drinks and food for the night. I will say that the staff was above and beyond and that going there was really fun. I had a great time in the space and the food was really pretty good.   There is a main dining area and a bar area. The bar area has the open windows to let a lot of breeze in and really made the space cooler than it could have been. The dining area was large enough to accommodate our party and still had space for other diners. I thought that the decor was pretty and very inviting. I like the play on the name of Tres Rios, three rivers, that is pretty funny.   They say that they are \"Pittsburgh with a Mexican twist\". I find this approach semi interesting but kinda weird? I don't know. Maybe it is just me because other than the name what is Pittsburgh about the food? There was a lot of slaw, but when I think Pittsburgh I think slaw, fries on salads, weird sandwiches, and that's about it. This was not that type of place.   Drinks:   Frida Kahlo: Hornitos Reposado / Grand Marnier / Pop Juice / Hypnotiq. This drink really hit the spot. Refreshing and sweet. I truly enjoyed this drink. I would get it again. I will say that I am usually not a tequila fan, but the representative from Hornitos was there to explain the different tequilas and it made me appreciate this drink and tequila a lot more.   Diego Rivera: Blanco Tequila / Tempranillo / Passionfruit / Raspberry Grenadine. Also a really refreshing choice. It was easy to drink and a nice way to listen to the presentation. I would say that I liked this one better than the Frida, but both were sweet and good and the sweetness took the edge off the tequila taste.  Hornitos Topshelf Margarita: Horintos Resposado / Grand Marnier. This was just a little sample of the margaritas that Tres Rios offers. I will say, this was probably the best margarita that I have had in a LONG time. Perfectly blended and easy to go down. I would get this again for sure.   Apps: Chips and Salsa Sampler: Green Tomatillo Salsa, Charred Tomato Salsa, Pico de Gallo. I will say, eh to this salsa sampler. The chips were bright and very crunchy but the salsas were just eh. I think that the green tomatillo was my favorite but none of them really struck me as a big wow.   Chicken Quesadilla Stack: Grilled chicken and cheese with a side of sour cream and salsa. For this one I was interested to see that it was more of a buffalo chicken than a regular chicken. It could be for our event they were trying different things and spicing it up. I actually really enjoyed it. I would have never done a buffalo chicken quesadilla but now that I have tried it, I will be back again for more.   Tacos:  Pato Tacos: Duck marinated and braised in a 3/R pepper combination and fresh citrus juice, shredded and topped with mango salsa, jicama slaw, and piced crema. I thought that theses were really enjoyable and the marinate was great!  Lamb Tacos: YEP, getting these again for sure! The lamb was perfectly cooked and not tough and the marinate was on point. But when I went to their menu they were listed under barbacoa tacos. Which to me usually implies pork, but I guess barbacoa is the way that the meat is cooked not a reference to the meat itself. They were also really good and I would get these again.   I enjoyed the atmosphere, the people, and the staff. It is a great place to hang out and have a drink while eating some tacos. I would go here again for sure. I am hoping to try more of the menu and to see what else they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Very unauthentic, overpriced, hipster version of what they call Mexican food.  However the service was excellent and the food came out quickly."}
{"text":"Tres Rios is an upscale taco restaurant in the South Side; it is also the first in that neighborhood, I believe. At around $3-4/taco, however it appears to be much more reasonable than other upscale taquerias such as Bakersfield and Condado.  My friend and I wandered the quiet streets of South Side (it was only 6pm on a Friday night) and a waitress from 3R enthusiastically beckoned us to give the restaurant a try! 3R has a pretty hip, modern-industrial vibe and seems that it would be a great place to get drinks!  I ordered the fajitas, which felt to be a bit small if it had been intended to be shared among two people (monetarily it does require two people to foot the hefty price). Nevertheless, the food was hot and the I did like the guacamole, which was refreshing and had bright notes of lime juice. I can see myself returning to try their many tacos."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and have decided to leave a review for our most recent visit.  I noticed a veggie burrito on their menu, but I asked them for a few simple modifications to take out dairy. The bartender was super friendly. He basically told me not to worry he will take care of it. When my food came out it was SO GOOD and FILLING! I'm sad I don't have a picture to show you, I think I was too busy eating this amazing burrito they offered me. It was veggie and bean packed. I look forward to going back and trying it again!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this new taco place in Southside. The restaurant itself is very clean and cute. We started off with the guacamole and chips. The guac was good and creamy. It had a nice tang to it and got pretty addicting.   The food came out pretty quickly. I had the barbacoa tacos which consisted of lamb. The presentation was very nice with the tacos served on a holder and wooden board. The tacos itself though were a bit disappointing. The lamb was so chewy that by the end of the meal my mouth hurt. The cilantro rice was mediocre with not a lot of flavor. My friend had the pato tacos and the duck was pretty good. My other friend had the beet tacos and enjoyed them.   They do not have a lot of vegetarian options. Not a bad taco place but with so many taco places in Pittsburgh, I don't know if its worth coming back."}
{"text":"We went here because we have tried every place one could possibly get tacos in the city and this place didn't disappoint. The theme I think they are trying to go for is authentic Mexican food for Pittsburgers. The restaurant describes itself as a Mexican kitchen and tequila bar, however I dont believe I got the full tequila bar experience since we sat at a table. To start I got a Winter Pear margarita which was too sweet for my taste and in a smaller glass than I had expected but it was tasty regardless. This was probably the first time I've had a marg with cinnamon and clove. We ordered a basket of chips (which I had to order and pay for) with 3 different types of salsa and the salsa was amazing but the first thing I noticed was that the chips were from a bag and not made in house. I ordered the pato (duck) tacos, served on a wooden plank, which did not disappoint. The corn tortillas seemed to be hand made and tasted amazing and the duck was cooked to perfection. The tacos were smaller than I had expected, but you get three of them which were more than enough food for me. I'm sure this place will do great with the location."}
{"text":"Ugh, I am so torn about this review. I truly wanted it to be a complete 5 star experience but sadly, it was not.   The pros!!! They were definitely all worth 5 stars: the Manager! So friendly and accommodating! (We had a group of 7) THE YUCCA BOWL..... OMG..... Get two orders, immediately. They are that good. The chips and salsa sampler (charred tomatillo was the best) and guac were all also terrific! The cilantro rice that comes on the side, also delish!  THE FRIED ICE CREAM!! We got one of each and didn't get any go to waste. The caramel was my favorite.  All of the tequila. All of it.   Average: The street corn was good but not all caps, lots of exclamation points, good. Same for the margaritas. We each got a different one and all said 'good!' but nothing that blew our minds.   Okay... the cons :(  The tacos. So you can see why I am so perplexed. Kinda hard to properly distribute stars for a Mexican place when everything EXCEPT the tacos were good. Our fish tasted.... oily? greasy? not sure the right word. The chicken was decent... but the shells... they weren't soft but they weren't hard either..... doesn't matter much what's inside if you can't even get past the shell. Man.   But I would absolutely go back and just get a smorgasbord of sides! And dessert!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent. We came in not knowing we had walked in on the tail end of a private party. The host mentioned that they would be there for another 30 mins, asked us to come back, and gave us a free appetizer coupon. Fair enough.   Before we could turn around to leave, the manager came over and said that it would be fine to seat us-just couldn't sit in the reserved section. Okay, cool.  Our server was super friendly and attentive. She was busy, and maybe by herself, and did a great job.  The food? Mehhh, it left a little to be desired. I see what the chef is trying to do. We got soup, shrimp tacos, and yucca fries. It all looked fresh and homemade, it just lacked a little flavor/spice for a Mexican meal. Maybe add a little kick here, some lime wedges would have been great to add to the tacos, side of sour cream maybe?   It's missing something- but it definitely has potential!!"}
{"text":"My rating seemed like a no-brainer to me.  The atmosphere is fun and they've really gone all out with the hipster mexican theme.  My husband and I went there for a late lunch/early dinner on a Saturday and it was pretty empty.  The service was excellent and the food was amazing.  We ordered the pork belly and duck tacos.  I really enjoyed the presentation style of the food - wood board instead of a plate. The house-made corn tortillas were really the icing on the cake for these tacos.  They were so good.   We had 30 minutes to eat and get to a movie in the works, and we did it successfully.  I was only disappointed I didn't have time to try any of their margaritas.  The serving size was perfect for me, and I left feeling satisfied, but not stuffed.   I would definitely come back here sometime when I have time to have a drink with my meal."}
{"text":"Chicken tacos were out of this world good. Got Patron shots afterwards and the bartender gave us very generous shots. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The wife and I came here on a Sunday afternoon just coming from the movies.  We were hungry and wanted to try a restaurant that we haven't been to yet.  A few weeks back we saw a few nice pictures of some tacos from here that intrigued us.  So after looking around we decided to give this place a try and we are glad that we did.   When we walked in it wasn't busy.  So we walked right up to the bar and sat down.  The bartender greeted us and told us about their drink specials.  My wife just got a beer and I actually ordered their Long Island that was on special for $5.  It was good but not very strong.  I just went with water after that.   We looked over the menu.  I was deciding to go with either the pork bell tacos or fish tacos.  I order fish tacos a lot at other restaurants so I decided to try their pork belly.  My wife was deciding between their Pato tacos or fajitas.  She went with the fajita.   Our bartender was slow in getting our order at first but after that the service and speed of our meal coming to us was quick.     Just sitting back waiting for our dinner I got to look around.  The bar is nice and open.  The decorations and televisions are inviting too.  I could come back here to watch a sporting event and have a real nice time.       Next our dinners came out.  My wife's fajitas came out smoking and smelling great just like a fajita is supposed to do.  I was a little jealous!  My food came out and the tacos looked great.  They tasted great too.  I used some of my wife's sour cream.  We put their green salsa on it too and it was quite tasty.  The Pork bell was juicy and the corn tortillas were perfect.  It comes with 3 but I could have eaten 5.  My wife gave me one of her fajitas so that helped!   Tres Rios is a nice restaurant.  I do want to come back to try a few of their other food items.  It wasn't busy so I don't know how it is there when it get's crazy but I did enjoy the service that we got here.    Tres Rios! Cuatro Estrellas!!!"}
{"text":"No complaints here! I stopped in by myself for lunch during a slow work day. The interior decor is very trendy. I started off with the empanadas and they were great. They were filled with ground beef and served on a layer of cheese sauce with some sour cream on top. Very savory. I got the pork belly tacos for my entree and these were also very good. The taco shell as you'll hear from many reviews is unique. It's like a cross between a corn and flour tortilla. Soft but crunchy on the outside. The pork belly was on point, and the sauce that came with the tacos was tasty. The black beans on the side were just like any black beans, but I really liked the cilantro rice. The rice was actually tinted green from all the cilantro used. In my opinion, you can never have too much cilantro! I would say this place leans more towards trendy, Americanized taco joint than super authentic, but the food and the environment are great!"}
{"text":"Ole everybody! Welcome to the new bar and Mexican eatery owned and run by the same person who owns Emilliano's restaurant and bar a few blocks down in the Southside. When my daughter and I arrived we learned that this place is primarily a young adult's hangout joint since they have a full bar as well as a small restaurant. They told us they opened the day after Thanksgiving last year.  We decided to skip the chips and salsa and try something different. My daughter opted for the chicken burrito. Since I had heard so much about the yucca fries I was thrilled to see that they come on a steak burrito so I ordered that. All burritos come with a small side salad and a Mexican style mayonnaise for dipping. Your food is served on a wooden plate.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. My daughter was admiring the artwork and steel beams set up here since she majored in art in college. She was very impressed especially with the Andy Warhol prints of different colored tacos on the wall.  On to the food. We both loved every bite of it! My steak was tender and you could taste the yucca fries inside. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her chicken burrito. Portion sizes are not too big but enough to satisfy your hunger. They only  had two items on the dessert menu but we decided to pass on that one.   In addition to burritos, the offer salads, sandwiches which come with chips, and of course various tacos. I've heard their duck leg taco is supposed to be very good but that warrants another visit. Yes and if you don't want meat they offer beet tacos which I'm sure would be worth checking out.  Another thing i want to add is how clean the place is and was admiring the plantscape which is by the rest rooms.   Expect to pay around $15.00 a person if you are not ordering drinks. Tres Rios which means \"Three Rivers\" in English centrally located in the Southside business district. There is a small pay parking lot diagonal from it if you are not able to fine street parking. Definitely worth a return trip!"}
{"text":"I am already trying to figure out when I can return to this restaurant after my first visit last Saturday. My husband and I actually left Steel Cactus which is only one block away due to crappy service and ended up here. The margs were on point, our waitress Madison could NOT have been nicer, and the food was some of the best Mexican I've ever had. The bartender came over and put necklaces on us (it was Cinco de Mayo) and asked us if our drinks were strong enough. Where does that happen?  The fish tacos were some of, if not the best I've ever had and my husband commented that the whole experience was in the top 5 restaurant experiences he's ever had. We will without a doubt be back, and be back often. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Decent food.   Upon hearing that this joint was owned by the same people as Emiliano's, I had really high hopes. We went on a Thursday night and sat at the bar. Our server was not just inattentive, but borderline hostile.  I accidentally ordered my food too early because she mumbled when asking what drinks we wanted.  Instead of rolling with it and taking our food order, she just glared at me and asked about drinks again.  20 minutes later we got to order our food. It was good, but not extraordinary.   The saving grace here is that this place is brand new, and that it's a really cute atmosphere, but neither of those things would make me choose this over Emiliano's or Bakersfield."}
{"text":"We tried this place while visiting Pittsburgh from California to me Tres Rios or Three Rivers fusses together an array of Latin ingredients and flavors and does so very well I loved the tacos made from freshly made tortillas and the meat empanadas were excellent and to top it all off the margaritas were the best! with such a fantastic and unique variety make sure to try the margarita sampler a real treat we will definitely look forward to our next visit to Pittsburgh and Tres Rios restaurant Oh Yes the wait staff especially the hostess that greeted us were friendly and inviting!"}
{"text":"This Mexican restaurant was such a nice surprise on a dreary day! It looks small from the outside, but it's pretty large inside, with bright decorations and a fun vibe inside. I came for lunch and it was dead... I hope that changes with the more great reviews this place gets!  I ordered the carne asada tacos and loved everything about it! I'm a sucker for good presentation, and it came out on a wood board with three perfectly stacked tacos on a holder, a bowl of rice and side of salsa verde. But the taste is what matters most, and they were definitely very flavorful. I loved adding the salsa verde to everything, and of course had to ask for more... I love salsa! I also loved the fresh made corn tortillas that are then deep fried to crisp perfection. A nice twist on a traditional taco.  Service was friendly and I really can't wait to come back for dinner and drinks!"}
{"text":"We got carne asada and barbacoa tacos. The green rice side was good and portioning was very small. Ordered lime on the side and they brought only ONE lemon slice even though we ordered two taco orders. Guac was ok, again small size portioning for the price. Not authentic at all. Tacos were not the best either, they were plain and flat in taste. When you serve tacos you are supposed to bring sides: lemon, cilantro, onion, poco de gallo, etc. I am from Mexico City so this is an honest review. I will not come back."}
{"text":"NATIONAL MARGARITA DAY  We decided to stop in for some frosty refreshment on Margarita day. We enjoyed the Margarita sampler and we're pleasantly surprised by the pepper Margarita which was the hands down favorite. We had the 3ir Nachos and the shrimp ceviche. Both of these were fine but nothing to get excited about. I will issue a warning leave the street corn alone. This dish tries to recreate classic elotes but fails ending up with greasy corn and mayo.   I will be back for drinks."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Very polite staff. Delicious food. Decent sized portions. Not too many \"traditional\" dishes, and the time felt a little long for an early Saturday with not too much going on, but those would be my only reason for not giving 5 stars. Our server was sure to check in on us every now and again and the staff was very kind. We ordered the chicken fajitas and chicken tacos which came in a very \"hispter-style\" serving tray. They both came with arroz verde and a few other things for you to piece together your meal with to your liking.  I know that's not my favorite restaurant trend in the world, personally, but it definitely wouldn't take away from your experience."}
