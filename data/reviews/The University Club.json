{"text":"The events that I have attended here have been great with tasty food. The building has a Victorian feel. It is on the pricy side but worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"RIPPED OFF!!  Beware of the difference between what the U-Club shows you in their slick on-line advertisements vs. what you actually get on your plate. My wife and I and another couple decided to dine there on Feb 13, 2015. The advertisement offered a champagne toast, roasted rack of lamb (4 chops were shown in the picture) an appetizer and a lucious looking dessert. What we got was NO champagne (our server said she would bring some for a charge), 2 tiny pieces of lamb, (not 4) and a sliver of dessert. All of this for $40 per person plus tax and tip.  THIS IS THE MOST DISSAPOINTING MEAL AND MOST EXPENSIVE MEAL I'VE EVER HAD."}
{"text":"I finally had lunch today at the University Club, vowing to come back after having a scrumptious dinner at a big event earlier this year.  (If you have a big event coming up such as a conference or an annual meeting, you'd be wise to check this place out.)  Anyway, my lunch started out very nicely with a friendly waitress and a basket of bread w/butter (Graft, take note!!)  I ordered the crab cake sandwich w/sweet potato fries and while it was getting crowded (when I left, every table was full) my food arrived in just the right time, hot and very appealing.  Tasty, too!  Many of the other diners were having the signature club sandwich which looked really good as well.  The check arrived with an after dinner mint, nice touch.    The near perfect lunch lost a star however, on two points:  the bread in the basket, had a slightly anomalous taste to it, like it had been sitting in the back of the freezer for a couple years.  And my waitress, sweet as she was, did not check to make sure everything was OK at the table.   (I could've used some more water...)    If you're ever down at the end of State Street and don't want to jostle in line at the food carts, give the U Club a try -- I think you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"My experience from the few events here has been splendid. The building has a old classic look. It is a pricy place but the food is great and the location and service is hard to beat. Close to State street, Union Terrace, and the university."}
{"text":"I cannot rave enough about the University Club. My husband and I had our wedding reception there on Sept 17, 2016, and we could not have been happier with our choice. Throughout this entire year, we have been so thrilled with them. From the get-go, Kyle (our onsite coordinator) and Justin (a manager) helped us with the process. Kyle was phenomenal!!!- unfortunately, he is leaving for a new job. But both of them were amazing and SO helpful. We chose the Uni Club because of its vintage vibe, the price (the rental includes a year membership and was WAY cheaper than any of the places I was looking at in Madison & Milwaukee) and their flexibility. This was especially important for me, as I can be a bit of a snob about food and drinks. And they blew me away with this-- I had requested that they bring in oysters for me and my husband to share, along with a couple of other special food requests. They also let me select the wine I wanted to feature (because I didn't want Canyon Ridge or some other generic wine like that)- we ended up going with their wines they had in house because they were all amazing!   They were so good about communicating with us and working to make the day exactly how we wanted it. They set up all of our decorations for us, Kyle stuck around the whole night to ensure everything went really well and everyone was raving about how wonderful the spot was that we chose. We are so, so happy with this venue and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a wedding venue!!! Thank you so much for making our wedding everything we had hoped for!!!"}
{"text":"Univeristy Club was that elusive building on campus I never got to go in as an undergraduate. After my friends' recent wedding reception here, that all changed.  The building itself is gorgeous. The brick on the outside becomes white walls with exposed wood paneling on the inside. It was a beautiful venue to celebrate the love of my beautiful friend and her wonderful now-husband.   However, it was horribly hot inside. The bridal party was sweating uncomfortably, as were the guests. Granted, it's an older building, so I don't know if it has central air or not, but it was blistering hot. The food, however, was only lukewarm when it was served. The staff, however, seemed wonderful, and overall, I thought it was a lovely location for a wedding reception."}
{"text":"We hosted our rehearsal dinner here and had a great time. We worked with Justin D., who was always pleasant and very helpful, and even let us create our own special drink with a store-bought syrup, etc. We did the fish fry dinner and the food was very good and kept getting replenished. We also did the ice cream sundae bar, which I think was the highlight and is highly recommended for any event! Justin was flexible with the choice of ice cream toppings, etc., and it was truly a pleasure to work with him.  I think the space is beautiful and has a great location, too, with a view of the Capitol if you go outside and just steps away from The Terrace.   I have gone for lunch many times too, and overall it's a good place to meet and dine."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 3 stars because I love the building itself and the memories I have while in the University Club, but the food that I have eaten here has been inconsistent and, at times, inedible. The food deserves 2 stars, or 1.   During a university event, we were served dinner, and I received potatoes that were undercooked, and another guest had chicken that was raw. This is not only unacceptable, but unsafe. On other occasions, I've had food that was OK, but it's definitely nothing to write home about.  It's a nice location, aesthetically, to host an event, especially a wedding, but don't expect anything from the food or service."}
{"text":"Interesting place, both from a location standpoint to food. The building is a historic building on the University of Wisconsin campus and used to be a club style building for university professors. It reminded me of an old fashioned hotel dining room. The decor is intentionally vintage, but the food offerings were a bit more eclectic than standard supper club fare. I enjoyed a Mediterranean hummus plate with olives and tabbouleh. The portion was huge and I couldn't finish it all. The location of the University Club would likely not be stumbled upon by someone not on campus, it did seem."}
{"text":"Popcorn crusted perch was a new surprise. Wished the potato pancakes were thinner & less oily. Ginger limeade is always refreshing. The lunch ambiance was more elegant with a guest guitarist strumming. Brian was attentive with smiles. It's always a treat to dine at the University Club."}
