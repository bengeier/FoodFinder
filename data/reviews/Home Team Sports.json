{"text":"Completely and utterly awful.  The service sucked, the food choice completely lame, and the shot glasses were a 1/2 shot.  The seating is cramped. Don't bother with this hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Unfortunately rude waitress. Got a sandwich and removed the bread because it was terrible!  Only came here because it was my only option.  Not much in this concourse. Get food before you get to e in Charlotte!!!!  I even tried to sub something and pay for it... Couldn't do it - wasn't even an option :( live and learn."}
{"text":"I ordered a $9 pre made sandwich and got a loaf of bread and two pieces of diced chicken.  If you're going to rip someone off, a least make a somewhat passable sandwich."}
{"text":"Listen you know it's an airport place so expecting some kind of amazing food experience is unreasonable.   I did experience good service (for airports), decent food (for airports), and a very large vodka. Hence my 4 stars."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow...  Food was sub par and flavorless. Oh and it took 40 minutes to make a sandwich. The beer was cold"}
{"text":"My wife and I had time to kill before boarding our flight.  We wanted to get a drink and watch a particular basketball game.  Neither the bartender on duty, nor the 2 servers \"could\" (or would) change the channel for us.  They were completely indifferent to our request.  Their claim that they needed \"another bartender\" to find the game/change the channel is mind-boggling, given the fact that they're all working in a sports bar!  We simply left."}
{"text":"The bartender was rude and acted like a zombie behind the bar. I am a bar owner so I watched with interest as the server and the bartender managed to look busy but accomplish nothing. We waited 45 minutes with no menu, no server, no food order-- no one came to the table. My husband tried to order at the bar- but was told he could order one drink only per customer.  The prices were higher than even the expected high prices of an airport so when our party of five ( all in thr bar industry ourselves) had been ignored long enough we walked to he sub shop brought our drinks and sandwiches back to the bar and sat down and ate them. No one even noticed or cared -they were not even half full and certainly not in the weeds so we should not have gone unnoticed. Bottom line. Can't comment on the food cause we couldn't even order. Drinks are over priced and one of our party ordered a double and it was about 2 thirds of an industry standard shot. SKIP THIS PLACE!!"}
{"text":"Keep walking. Quality is horrible, looks and tastes like it was pre-cooked and microwaved."}
{"text":"Great to grab a drink before your flight and watch sports on the many tv's. Don't order food or you will be sorely disappointed"}
{"text":"Terrible.  I stop by here expecting at a minimum some standard sports bar fare like burgers and fries.  I was disappointed to find that everything is pre made, wrapped in plastic and very cold.  You're better off going to the food cart in the terminal."}
{"text":"Ok it looks like my yekp specialty is reviewing restaurants in airports. What i like about this place is its non chain feel, and the fact that while you're there you forget, maybe for just a few moments, that your in an airport terminal. solid bar food, I've had the buffalo tenders and the burger. I think they measure their shots (makes fof weak drinks), so stick to beer."}
{"text":"Skip this place if you're more interested in food than alcohol. Turns out their food is all pre-prepared cold (and by that I mean almost frozen), cello-wrapped sandwiches and packaged salads. You can do better for less elsewhere in the terminal. Beer was fine, if a rather limited selection. They do have a full bar."}
{"text":"If you need a drink so bad that you will stop here, then you are an alcoholic. The bartender was a beat up, washed out, utterly obese Elvis impersonator. He was the perfect metaphor for vegas or Fox. Your choice.  Skip this place and wait for your plane."}
{"text":"I don't know which was worse - the service or the food. Suffice it to say that both were abysmal. The waiter was downright rude and, even though I hadn't eaten in a good 12 hours, I couldn't finish the horrible bowl of chili I was served. On top of that, the place smelled like a sour mop and stale beer. I have to think that the sole reason this place stays in business is because it's the only sit down place in the concourse where it's located."}
{"text":"Conveniently located at the airport, this place has a decent selection of drinks and food. However the service is horrible. They only have one waitress. Don't come here if you are hungry, you will not be fed"}
{"text":"We walked out of our B gate, searching for a beer. We took a right and it wasn't long before we ran straight into FOX sports SKY \"lounge\". We were so excited. We approached the bar and we were greeted with a frown from the male bartender. He stood and tapped his fingers impatiently as we set down our bags. My mother asked, \"are you waiting on us?\" He threw some napkins at us and said, \"yeah just tell me when you're ready\". Ugh. I didn't want to be here any longer but figured that we could \"turn his frown upside-down\" somehow. Nope, wrong! We ordered out beers, they only had 4 to choose from. Ugh. We decided to close out even though we had an hour to kill. But we no longer wanted to be in his presence. He continued to saunter around in his Depressing mood. For my Shocktop Belgian Wheat, guess what the price was? $10.17. Lol. A few chairs down from me, a man received his bill. To his dismay it came to $125.23. He got out of his chair and calmly questioned the bartender about the amount. The bartender barked, \"we'll come look at the screen yourself!\" The poor guy didnt realize that it was $10 a beer and on top of that he had ordered a sandwich, chips, and some bottled drinks for his trip. The bartender was indifferent and insensitive. So the man said, \"wow! I didn't realize it was this price! I mean, I have the money but this is highway robbery.\" The bartender just scoffed. Ugh. My mother and I each left $1 and even THAT was too much!"}
{"text":"This is the former Fox Sports Sky Box bar at McCarran International Airport near the B gates. Same management, still in need of a remodel, different name. It's non-smoking and has no wait staff. There is a slot room nearby that allows smoking."}
{"text":"This ended up being a GREAT place only because I was able to watch the GIANTS win the 2012 championship game before I had to catch my flight!!!  They did have a limited menu of food.  Another downer was that when we arrived around 7:30pm a waitress told us she was off and if we wanted anything we had to go to the bar.  Needless to say I kept seeing her pass our table for the next 45 min.  Her loss of a tip.  Oh well...  Funny how the signs say tables are for patrons only and it was so hard to get food or drinks.  I really can't complain too much though cuz they didn't kick us out and some of us had food from other places since we couldn't get them to take our order.  I was just glad to be able to watch the game.  Other than that I wouldn't recommend this place for drinks and food!"}
{"text":"Growing up, many people wish for a job where they can travel. Many of us who have those jobs wish for simpler things. While in the airport, I wish not to be delayed through security, I wish for a quiet companion next to me on the flight, and sometimes I wish for a decent fast bar to have a beer while waiting.  The Fox Sports Sky Box Lounge fails on almost all counts. The bar is a fishbowl of smokers with little ventilation and poor housekeeping. The servers are less friendly than airport security on a bad day. The beer selection is domestic and boring.  For a city which prides itself on great service, unique experiences, drinking and gambling, this place is an obscene gesture towards all that is fun and entertaining."}
{"text":"skip unless you like pre-packaged food and rude bartenders"}
{"text":"The best thing to say is that the waitstaff is polite.  Mediocre food.  Overpriced for menu options.  If you have to eat here, buy a beer.  It will make the food better.  I ordered a quesadilla (steak) with a side of guacamole and a Coca Cola.  My soda was so anemic looking I thought it was weak tea.  I was never offered a refill.  The quesadilla looked great, despite the nearly two dollar guacamole only containing a tablespoon of guacamole.  The dried and shriveled green onion garnish was unneeded.  After attempting to eat the quesadilla, I discovered that despite the attractive appearance, the filling to cheese ratio was horrible and the entire thing fell apart and had to be eaten by fork.  The steak filling was overdone to the point of being inedible and the corn and black bean relish they put in it just made the small bit of cheese coagulate in a grainy mess.  Save yourself the money and just pick up food at Burger King."}
{"text":"Service was horrendous, slow & unresponsive. Most of the staff had an attitude of indifference."}
{"text":"You would think with the World Cup game on they would have the sound up and on TV.  The game is on 4 TV's and baseball games on the other.  People asked to change the channels so they could see and they were rude.  The heavyset male bartender was RUDE!  he yelled at a number of customers, was eating behind the bar.  The menu is all prepackaged food.  Not a place to eat or drink sorry!  The waitress is alone and was running crazy.  Corona was $9!  Terrible place."}
{"text":"$10 for a pint of crappy Samuel Adams Winter Lager. Okay, fine, it was an imperial pint. So what. The keg blew mid-pour, so the bartender told me she'd \"top me off\" after it was replaced. An hour later, she brought out a highball glass with exactly the amount that was missing from my pint, rather than just giving me a full pour for the inconvenience. Awesome how she saved Fox Sports a nickle like that.  I rest my case..."}
{"text":"I like this place because of my politcal views.  I see a number of one-star reviews on here purely because of leftist politcal views.  Not sure what you're expecting of an airport bar....in dirty Vegas, but 19 TV's playing 19 different sporting events and beer is all I need while waiting for a flt.  Not everything in dirty Vegas has a dude in a grape-smuggler swinging from a bloody trapeeze."}
{"text":"This place is in the airport near gate E20. 4 stars; they have a good selection of draft beer. Food is typical airport food, 2 stars at most. Sliders were small even for sliders. They're Missing the whole concept of making them special. These were nothing more than a regular burger split into 4 pieces and put on low quality buns. Oh and the chipotle part that's called out in the menu, is just a low quality hot sauce. Order a regular burger instead if your adventuresome. Onion rings were Luke warm, not really edible. The side salad was surprising good.    In summary, come for the beer, get a salad or skip the food altogether."}
{"text":"FOOD: BYOF! Yes... Bring your own food to this sports bar. They only sell bags of chips and pre packaged sandwiches. So don't be the 100th person to ask the poor bartender if they serve food because they don't. And he will tell you to get food else wear and bring it back. Too bad not many choices on this side of the airport. But do what you gotta do. Then you can order alky to your liking here.   INSIDE: plenty of Tvs and tables and chairs. Sports jerseys in glass cases along the walls. Sports bar lounge feel to this place.   DRINKS: they have some beer on tap.  STAFF: bartender was friendly and joked around with customers especially nice to hear considering he had to repeat himself so many times about where people can buy food and bring it back."}
{"text":"It was nice that I was able to catch the Texans game between my flights, but I wish I had ventured further down and around to the chilis because they only have pre-made sandwiches and chips. The couple next to me even went and got a to go order from chilis and brought it back here to eat at the bar.   Everyone in the bar was really nice and the bartender was good too."}
{"text":"I can't imagine how this place could get this many bad reviews. It's a bar...they only have sandwiches, so if you want food, I'd go somewhere else. However, for what it is, a sports bar to watch games and get a drink, it's great. The wine is a little pricey for my liking, but everywhere else is too in this airport. The bartenders were nice and the drinks were cold. Exactly what I'm looking for in a bar while I'm waiting for my flight"}
{"text":"Terrible food and service. Ordered nachos. Took a long time and the food was cold when I got it. They also added guac even though I didn't order it. This is a place you can tell is poorly managed... Do not go here"}
{"text":"I am surprised at all the 1 star reviews!  Maybe my expectations are low for an Airport sports lounge IDK??  I miss this place, We used to fly out of Vegas on SW Airlines B gates and we always finished our trip with a huge beer from this place!  Now we seem to fly out using the C gates and only a Chili's Two is available. :(   If you are grabbing something to eat, I prob would go somewhere else, but I always had good service from the waitstaff and the multiple TV's were awesome for killing time.  I could care less about politics when i visit a sports bar.  As long as the beer is cold, TV's are running and I have good friends with me, I am good to go!  If you are a sports fan looking for a huge cold beer (only about $10 for 32 oz mug) then ignore the reviews and take a seat."}
{"text":"THIS \"SPORTS BAR\" HAS NO KITCHEN!!!  That's right...a \"sports bar\" without hot food.  Simply unbelievable.  Needless to say, my husband and I promptly left and went to Chili's to watch the Heat-Celtics game while we waited through a long flight delay."}
{"text":"This place is true to its star rating; that being said, there isn't much better in this part of the airport, so it's a fine enough place to sit and get a drink, as service is kind and, even when they're busy, pretty punctual.    Unless you are starving to death and don't care what you eat, don't order food here.  Everything is prepackaged (like in two or three other spots, too) and they only have sad little sandwiches or salads. If you're going to be here a while, take advantage of the 'order a beer, get a shot for $5' deal."}
{"text":"With limited options of places to grab a drink prior to your flight in Terminal B, Home Team Sports will have to work, and for me it worked out fine. The bartender on duty was friendly and made a pretty good bloody Mary. Prices were what you would expect from an airport bar, and they don't serve food, so keep that in mind. Otherwise, an A-OK place to grab a pre-flight beverage."}
{"text":"Want to watch a game and have a beer before your flight, then Home Team Sports bar is for you.  If you want some NON-packaged food, then keep on moving to another spot in the airport."}
{"text":"There aren't many options at the B gate, but for the one place to get a Bloody Mary during an after Vegas morning, it is a good one. The bartender, Sarah, is a total sweetheart."}
{"text":"I'm always devastated when I have to fly out of the B  gates because I know that this is the only place you can go to get a drink.  The smell of the bar is vomit-inducing; it reminds me of a cheap college bar where they play Lil Wayne and coeds grind on each other while spilling beer all over the slippery floor.  I can't imagine what Jon Taffer from Bar Rescue would find at the bottom of the ice bin here, but I guarantee you it would be disgusting and rhyme with \"old\".  Hungry?  Get ready to enjoy some cellophane wrapped sandwiches that make the selection at Circle K look like gourmet fare.  Do yourself a favor and starve yourself until you get to your next destination. And if you're craving a buzz, bring a bunch of mini shots in your bag and suck em down while playing the slots."}
{"text":"We only stopped in for drinks, so I can't comment on the food.  However, I can say that the service was great and the bar was nice and clean.  Plenty of TV's to watch your game on.    I would make this place a regular stop if I come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to grab a Beer while I waited for my flight out of Gate B-19.  It's a medium sized bar with around 14 seats and a dining area that seats around 50 people.  It's located near the B Gates where it splits into a fork.  I ordered a giant (see pics) 32 oz Stella ($10.99)....not a bad price for an Airport Bar, right?  How could I resist?  It's going to be a nice plan ride to San Diego.....ha!  Will I return?  Next time I depart out of the B Gates, you know where you'll find me!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was located along gates E and I had just enough time to go back to the restaurant to place a TO-GO order.  I got the Chicken Swiss Sandwich with fries. The fries were so good as I craved something salty on the plane prior to getting off.  The waitress talked quickly and placed my order but I started to wonder how long it would be to put it together as time was ticking. She gave me my glass of water to enjoy while I waited but asked for it in a to-go cup.  She returned with the cup only to flip it over across the bar onto the bar stool next to me.  Had it wet my clothes, it would have been a bad night.  She rudely threw the a wet cloth from behind the counter to her co-worker who was cleaning but very disrespectful.  Did I want to leave a tip!?  There isn't any ketchup packs so you have to disperse it onto your plate. Anyhow, I got my order and had time to eat a couple fries before departing (food welcome on charter plane).  The fries were good but the chicken was a little dry.  The bacon was okay because it was breaking apart and not really crispy.  I was so glad I had this meal because the plane returned to the airport to stay overnight due to the fog at my final destination.  The meal lasted me all night."}
{"text":"I had to watch some NASCAR which this place has a lot of TV's!  Our waitress was great and quick to serve and always checked on us. The fiesta chicken salad was tasty and filing. Along with a nice pour from the bar which helped. Give it a try but remember its a sports bar in a high traffic airport so be patient."}
{"text":"Yay for cold burgers! Pretty sure my fries and burgers were the same temp as the beer.   Southern hospitality also misses this establishment - some waitresses here seem to be bonused on how unfriendly they can be and still take their time to not give you food and your check.   Saving grace for them is location- and their lonerider shotgun Betty hef (local beer), be sure to ask for two beers and two waters you may not be visited again by your waitress."}
{"text":"For real food on E concourse, this is about your only choice.  There is also burger king and salsaritas, but I'm not a fan of either. The drinks aren't bad, but the service could use some work. Took about 10 minutes for the waiter to show up. Crab cakes arent bad, though."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place - they only carry a few hundred hats and the prices are a bit high - in my opinion. They also don't have much in sales or clearance and their staff didn't seem as friendly as normal.  I always stop in here because it seems like I always have some time to kill, but this time I left without a hat!  The place is well stocked, organized and clean!"}
{"text":"After ordering I checked out Yelp to see what I was in for as I came in without any due diligence. I became pretty worried when the only great review was from someone saying this restaurant had \"a few hundred hats.\" Um, I think he was thinking of a sports wear store as I didn't see any hats.  Though the service was good, the food was nothing great, just typical airport food. A fish and chips plate was over $15.  The sports side has to be the the 8 or so TVs they have."}
{"text":"Over $10 for a pint of beer (at least it's Goose Island?). I guess that $4 shot they try to add to every round might be a steal after all.   They don't serve food and apparently don't clean the tables either, and yet this place is hopping, probably because it's the only place that serves alcohol at this end of the Southwest gates.   Not gonna lie, though. It's entertaining sitting at the bar, watching the bartender Gary work the crowd as people realize they're going to get charged nearly $11 for a beer, or better yet, $34 for two Jäger bombs. That's gotta hurt."}
{"text":"HELL NO!!!! Rude service!!!  when we came in, the whole place had ONE server and TWO bartenders?  lets do the math...about 10+tables(2~4 people seaters), you gonna let one lady handling that, but 2 bartenders to handle 10 people bar seats???? Who is the MANAGER????  We sat down for 5 min, the server running around like a mad lady trying to do her job, and one of the bartender just talk and talk and talk and talk.  Finally decided to get drinks from the bar ourselves, then the rude guy told us \"I HAVE TWO PEOPLE IN FRONT OF YOU\" really cuz we sat down before them?????   Very pushy for their \"double shot is only $4 more\"   NEVER EVER COMING BACK!"}
{"text":"I got to the airport and had some time to kill so went in here to do so.  The people working here were really friendly and I appreciated all the t.v.'s. :)"}
{"text":"Always under staffed. The food is all pre-packed and not very good food (even for an airport). But, they have beer and sports. Sometimes you are just desperate enough..."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service and good menu choices, however \"classic caesar's dressing\" on their salad is not. It's Italian dressing."}
{"text":"Food: Cold, boring, pre-bagged, and literally tossed into a heap in the corner of a fridge around the side of a bar, you should pass on these sandwiches.  The salads don't fare much better.  Drink: these bartenders are the suck.  As in they don't give eye contact, don't welcome you, and don't take your order.  The bar looked like it was in shambles with an embarrassingly small selection.  Some of the top shelf bottles sat hidden in the well while the back of the bar sat nearly empty.  For a city known for food, the Vegas airport is remarkably piss poor for options.  You don't have to work hard to be the best in any class in this crappy airport, but these guys appear to be pushing for the worst in show."}
{"text":"The worst food I've had in a long time. Ordered wings that were inedible. Sent that back. Got a Ceasar salad...aweful!! The only thing decent was the beer.  Skip it unless you want a beer and a burger. Basically Sysco food service food cooked poorly."}
{"text":"Only dropped in for drinks but was glad to see that they actually had the \"Captain's Special.\"  It's pretty much buy a beer, and get a shot for $5 more.  It was $6 for top shelf shots.  Comes out to about $16 for two drinks, which is a good deal at the airport.  Considering the beer was already 10 bucks, might as well make it worth it and get the shot.  They also had craft beers on tap, so that definitely was a bonus.  Lots of TVs to watch sports as well.  If there were slot machines here, it would have been perfect.  Service was almost non existence at the table and I had to go to the bar to get some drinks."}
{"text":"I was a hour or so early for my flight back to Sacramento so I took the only open seat at the bar, which was directly in front of the beer taps, on the far end of the bar, not an ideal spot, as there was little no space to read a magazine or eat.  A new spot opened up so I grabbed what I could to move and Dean got flat out irritated that he had to move my drink (expensive drink) two feet.   I then had to wait 10 minutes for my water, as he leaned against the bar with his had on his hip, then waited another 15 for second drink, which is a short pour from a beveled shot glass, to the line, not the top as it was supposed to be.  I could have managed and been OK if it had not been for his piss poor, I don't give a crap, I hate my job attitude - so I left.  I had the opportunity to run into a management member and spoke briefly with her and she shared that I was not the only one to bring up his poor attitude.  I won't go back on my next trip through Vegas if he is at the bar."}
