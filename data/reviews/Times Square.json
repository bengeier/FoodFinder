{"text":"Warm greeting, seated quickly, service was good and the food was great. I look forward to returning and trying more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Went in and it seemed like a cheap diner. The prices are outrageous and the food literally isn't great. Got a cannoli to go and that thing did not taste good at all. Will not visit again. The waiter was nice at least."}
{"text":"Great bloody Mary bar, good breakfast specials. Nice outdoor seating area.  I haven't tried lunch or dinner but they got a great Italian food selection, not just pizza."}
{"text":"PERFECTION! Its about time the West Valley get a great place to eat. LOVE LOVE LOVE! Will be coming back. Service as super, food was exactly what we needed and wanted. Wonderful for families. Can't say enough good things about EVERYTHING. Well done!! We will make this a place to return many times over. THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"Chicken Alfredo good. -1 star because our server smelled strongly like cigarettes. -1 star because the bread was cold as if it may have been defrosted, but never toasted."}
{"text":"I went to the new Litchfield Park location last night. I had the peppers and sausage over pasta,  it was delicious. The staff was very friendly and they knew a lot about the menu. We will be back."}
{"text":"I got the Yelp alert about a hot new restaurant near me and decided to check it out. My other half and I went for breakfast today and overall it was okay.  Pros     - Decor and atmosphere is pleasant     - Breakfast was priced right     - Choices on menu were significant     - Everything was cool right  Cons     - Location is a bit hidden (not a lot of food traffic)      - Server wasn't very welcoming      - Chipped beef gravy for biscuits just wasn't my thing....sausage gravy. (Personal preference)  Overall it was decent, but not enough to warrant a return trip for me. For these out of the way places to get the repeat business, they really need to make a good first impression. When your server is impersonal, it really hurts the dining experience."}
{"text":"Had ordered take out and this was our first time trying this spot out. We weren't impressed. We won't count them out yet, we will try dining there and hopefully the meal will be better."}
{"text":"Been to another location (7th and Union Hills) so was happy when this one opened.  Only been there for breakfast so far.  Couple good things, couple bad.  Can't wait to try lunch/dinner and will amend review.  Good:  Nice, clean restaurant.  Very friendly staff.  Loved our server but her name escapes me.  Nice selection of breakfast choices.  Our son loved the corned beef hash.  The cook actually knew how to make over-medium eggs properly.  Thank you so much for that.  80% of the time I get my eggs and the whites are runny.  Not here.  Very generous 20% military discount.    Bad:  Bacon is the saltiest I've had in some time.  It was so salty that my wife (who LOVES bacon) couldn't finish even half of hers.  They need more servers.  There were 2 servers and at one point there were 12 tables with customers.  Service, while friendly, was very slow.  French toast is quite wimpy.  Looks like Wonder Bread french toast cut diagonally in half.    I'm sure this place is more known for pasta and meat dishes so we definitely will go back for lunch or dinner.  But for breakfast, this place is average."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. One of our favorites. A great addition to the West Valley. That said, tonight was a complete disappointment.  They were not busy and we were seated quickly. Then, we apparently turned into the invisible family. No one came to our table for over 20 minutes. No one. We were ready to order entrees and we had not even been given water. Our youngest son set a timer for 5 minutes at the 15 minute mark at which time we all agreed to leave. So sad. Great food but learn how to treat customers (not to mention regulars)."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on June 16, 2017. If you like a greasy oily pizza that is not fully cooked and doughy this is the place for you. Ordered a cheese pepperoni pie and then when you picked up a slice to place on your plate, the entire cheese pepperoni slid completely off the pizza dough slice. Also if you order a glass of wine be aware that it is a 5 oz pour for $7 of Hess. Asked the manager if this was a normal pour and with attitude she said she would check and came back to confirm it was a 5 oz pour, again with attitude. Ordered a side salad of Caesar salad that was average at best. We left half the pie and did not take it to go it was so god awful. We would have complained about the pie but since the manager had such a sour attitude we decided to just rack it up to a poor restaurant choice and waste of calories. Needless to say we won't be going back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I am soooo pleased that there is now a new competitor for italian food on the west side ! I am WOWED by the food this establishment puts out.We have been here several times and I haven't repeated a dish yet and I have been have never been nothing but PLEASED !!!! I STRONGLY recommend Times Square in Litchfield Park as a goto destination if your are in search of an authentic Italian meal. I speak from experience as I have traveled to 38 countries and 40 states.  Don't  delay trying this place ! ! !"}
{"text":"I love this place. From the food to the servers and management. We had a great meal and we are sure to back soon.  Pasta, pizza and more."}
{"text":"This place was okay. My spaghetti was so watery, I couldn't finish it. My husband got the cheesesteak sandwich and he said it was just okay. Nice atmosphere and very clean. Might try a pizza next time."}
{"text":"It was ok.  Bruschetta was tasty but a couple of pieces were so soggy they fell apart. Linguine with clams not too salty or over-garlicky but clams were pretty small (I know it's the desert but ...).  Pollo Marconi was a great idea (like an Italian chicken cordon bleu/lasagna/eggplant-chicken parm mash up) but the chicken was paper thin and the provolone cheese on top wasn't melted at all. The sauce they call a tomato cream demi-glaze was really good (make sure to get the side spag on the plate with that) Nice people, nice enough place, might try again."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE service! DO NOT COME HERE. Walked in on a Sunday after noon and it was dead! There was only two tables filled. Walked in with my mom and I guy was cleaning a table and said we will be right with you. Okay cool.  7 min go by and no one comes, yet there are 3 employees in the kitchen just staring and talking having a jolly time. We see the original guy who was cleaning a table start walking towards us so we think he is coming to us. Nope! He starts cleaning the table behind us!!! Like have you lost your mind at this point? We had no menu, no one asked if we wanted a drink , nothing for 10 minutes. So we get up and walk out.  I have never been here and was excited to try it but I will never be back."}
{"text":"We've been to the location on 27th and Deer Valley several times and it's always a great experience. We went here Sunday for lunch only to find there was no lunch specials on Sunday, and their cheesesteak weren't served until after 1pm, so we got breakfast for lunch as that was the only specials menu available. Got the chorizo scramble, it was great! The wait staff needs a bit of refining but it's a relatively new restaurant, they'll iron out the kinks!!"}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible experience. Terrible food, terrible service. Nothing good about this restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight after calling in a couple weeks ago and being told that we could special order to accommodate our vegan diet.  Upon coming in our server was very nice and fully understood our request. She went to the manager to make sure it could be done and she said no flat out with no other options.   Our server came back and was very apologetic and very surprised that there was nothing that could be done."}
{"text":"This was our first experience here. We ordered to go as taking 3 small kids is a hassle and easier. We get our food home only to realize the pasta order was wrong. I took it back and explained it was not what I ordered and want it fixed. After stating I just would like like my money back for the pasta, as I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes. I was told they don't do that and they could comp me on my next call in. I said no, I would like my money returned. They had to get the manager to do it which was fine. After the manager came to give me my money back,I said thank you and left. Got home to eat the rest of our food which is still hot and ready to eat, we live minutes down the road. We go to eat and the fried calamari was terrible. The calzones we ordered had a burnt taste to them and just weren't good. Very very saddened as I heard good things but was severely disappointed. There is no quality to their food or to the staff who couldn't put in our order correctly or the cook who should be fired."}
{"text":"Very good Italian food ! My favorite is their Pollo Ortega !! I always order to go and sometimes the people who answer don't seem that experienced and in a rush . Prices are a bit on the high side so we don't order from here as often ."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast on Sunday, it's a great looking place and the menu is extensive, very happy that they serve breakfast late on the weekends. Service was nice, she forgot to bring the toast though. Update!  Came in for dinner the next week,  they had a full house but it took 4 minutes to be acknowledged by staff. Patio still closed. Server was quick and the garlic bread was good. Meatballs were bland but the sauces were tasty."}
{"text":"Chicken Parm - delicious.  Already ordered it on three different visits and it was great every time.  Good food portion which means to me that I can take some home for the next day!  Pizza is very good too.  My wife had that anti-pasta plate and she loved it.  Yummy!  Yelp says they open for breakfast at 6:00am... but I went a few days ago at about 6:10am and they were not open.  I looked at their web site afterwards and their hours are posted as open at 7:00am... hmmmmmmm.....  Yelp needs to fix this.    Definitely eat here - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A friend and I had lunch there yesterday (2/10/17).  I had the osso bucco and she had the cheese steak.  Both were excellent except the osso bucco was only warm, not hot.  Service was great.  I ordered the bread pudding to take home.  That is the reason for only 4 stars.  I didn't like their recipe.  The bread pudding was dry--if cream was used, I couldn't discern it.  In fact, it looked like pieces of bread piled on top of each other.  I have to admit I could taste the  cinammon but other than that, it was dry.  The bread pudding at the Haymaker is considerably better.  However, that being said, I will be back--I just won't order the bread pudding."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Make sure to get there early, or you will have to wait. I always order my pasta with extra sauce as it is only a few dollars more. If they bring you extra sauce on the side it is $7 more. Crazy!! Everything is homemade so it's delicious. They also have amazing salads for a lighter option!!"}
{"text":"We recently heard about this new restaurant through a Yelp alert. It is a new restaurant close to home and we thought we would give it a try. We headed out for a late dinner Friday night and arrived around 8. The place was packed but they quickly found us a table for 2. Looking around everyone looked happy. We were quickly greeted by our waitress Denise. She was full of energy and welcomed us as first time guests. After looking over the large menu a few times I settled on lasagna and the hubby on Joe's special. We shared a dinner salad and I'm glad we did, it was huge.  Denise checked in with us often and made sure our drinks were refreshed. The entrees arrived and both dishes were very good. The lasagna was hot and topped with melted cheese that went on for days as your bite went from plate to mouth. Hubby's dinner was grilled chicken breasts with lemon and spinach. Great flavor and very fresh. We left with no room for dessert, but maybe next time. We already have plans to return and are ready to order the chicken Parmesan pizza!"}
{"text":"Our service was rather slow, even considering that they had only been open 3 weeks.  The food was decent and they have a good patio area without smoking, which is awesome for those of us who want to be outside and not have people smoking around me while I eat."}
{"text":"I was expecting better service this being near my neighborhood. The bartender was quite nice, offer suggestions and gave us feedback as he took our order.  Unfortunately, a waiter I believe decided to help and grabbed our bill with credit card and walked to the kitchen with both our payment and receipt. She came back with half of our to-go order, and proceeded to ring her order at the kiosk by the bar. The mysterious questions; Why did she take our payment to the kitchen when right in front of us was the kiosk she range us up at? Sketchy!  On top of this awkward moment all we heard was the waiter complaining of her fellow coworkers and nonsense obstacles she's facing. We understand you're having a bad day, it's common but customers like myself would like to enjoy a meal. Conversation like those should probably be kept in office or somewhere else and not in a professional environment where customers would like to dine in peace."}
{"text":"Came here to eat bfast on Saturday.  They were packed, so had a 15 min wait, which was ok because the host gave us a proper expectation.  Had the pancake bfast with sausage and eggs, and coffee.  Our food was fresh, arrived within a decent amount of time, and was good!  We received good service and enjoyed the atmosphere.  Also, the prices are fair!  The bathrooms were clean too.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!  Great food, wonderful variety and willing to accommodate special dietary requests.  Best Mediterranean salad ever and enough left over for another meal the next day. Pizza, fish, salads, pasta, chicken, veal. apps--something for everyone!"}
{"text":"We've now eaten at Times Square five times for both lunch and dinner. The food is always very, very good. We've had pizza and cheese steaks for lunch, both very good. For dinner, we've had chicken Parmigiana, and several pasta dishes. All the food is very good. The service is my biggest complaint. Either they don't have silverware, or make a mistake with our meal. Any other Restaraunt that makes a mistake will either replace it or not charge you for their mistakes, not this place. They treat you like it's your fault. If it only happened once then it would be fine, but there is a service issue every time we eat there. Like I said, the food is actually very good, but the service is really bad. Will probably start going back to Bella Luna because the service is equally as good as the food."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and Bree always came around to check our table & the other customers to make sure they were satisfied."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Incredible/friendly service.  Highly recommend!  Fish fry was amazing!  Absolutely the best coleslaw ever!! Never had anything we didn't love!  Terry and Angela rock!!  Our most favorite place!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches!! That's the main reason I go there, plus for some ice cold Peroni beer.  I will eventually go eat something else, but for now, sandwiches are perfect for me.  Thank you Lindsey and Terry!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Alexie was our server and made some recommendations that were on point. We will be back."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for dinner and it was outstanding. Everything from the pizza to the fettuccine, the salad, the pasta and also including the Spicy Bloody Mary's. Not only was the food outstanding the service was just as good. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I stop here very often. Good food, clean, reasonable prices, great service, plus, close to home."}
{"text":"Yum! The hot pastrami sandwich was soooo tasty!  They were very busy on a Thursday night. We had to wait for menus and never saw a wine list but that wasn't a big deal. Service was good and I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Our first visit here...Minestrone soup, osso bucco and chioppeni FANTASTIC.  The sauces were to die for.  Our waitress, Crystal, was sweet, accommodating and super attentive.  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Needed a quick pick up for lunch and realized we had never visited this restaurant, even though it is only 5 minutes from my house.  I shop at the grocery store next door all the time.  I called ahead after reading their menu online.  I normally don't order a to go order at a restaurant I have not previously visited, but I took a chance.  I ordered an onion and mushroom cheese steak with no peppers.  A large pizza half cheese half pepperoni and a pastrami and provolone sub.  The total was almost $40 dollars.  Which I think it is a pretty good deal.   They told me it would be ready in about 25 minutes, since it was lunch time I completely understood.  I got there after 15 minutes and the hostesses at the front were friendly.  I looked around and they had a side with booths as well as with restaurant style tables.  They also have a nice patio outside.  Like I mentioned, 15 minutes after placing the order the food was ready when I arrived.  They brought it from the kitchen nice and hot.  It smelled great in there.  The pizza I got filled my car with that delicious scent.  LOL  I paid and was on my way.    Over all, I'd like to say that everything I ordered was tasty.  Specially after ordering blindly.  The only tiny itty bitty issue I had was with my steak and cheese.  It was very dry, I expected my sub to have mayo, lettuce and tomato, sadly it was plain.  The steak had not been cut up or cooked properly to make it tender so it was very dry and flavorless.  Just large pieces topped with the mushrooms, onion and cheese.    My husbands pastrami sub was really good per him.  Ans the pizza was tasty.  We have plans to go back and have a seat down meal soon."}
{"text":"My George says it's was wonderful....however to me it was basic pretty good customer service. He, however was very impressed. I personally like the idea of a \"times square\" in Phoenix. He loved the wings. I had a mushroom Alfredo dish which was Pretty good..............the second time around."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian bistro on the west side of Phoenix.  Everything I've ordered so far has been great!  The chicken parmigiana and angel hair pasta is my favorite!  Great drink selection and well stocked bar."}
{"text":"Good food at reasonable prices. Food was served nice and hot which is a big plus for me. There was plenty of sauce on the pasta which I really like. I would prefer breadsticks to the long rolls sliced in half. Also the iced tea tasted more like instant than brewed. However those are fairly small issues and we will be back."}
{"text":"Saturday, February 18, 2017 This is hard to rate.  I would have given it 5 stars for the food, but the greeting dampened it. We got there early and the restaurant was almost empty.  (There were people waiting when we left.  It got very busy.)  We were a party of 4.  The hostess never greeted us, never smiled.  She sat us at a booth near the door, never asking if that was ok.  She gave us ONE menu for all 4 of us.  When I asked for more menus, she said that was all we could have since they didn't have enough.  Our waitress was nice enough, but I felt as though she was rushing us and couldn't wait for us to finish telling her what we wanted. We are originally from the Philadelphia area.  My husband still ordered a cheesesteak and it was excellent.  I had the Italian sub.  It is offered with mayo and Italian dressing.  Those do not belong on an Italian sub.  I opted out of them.  It was very good, but the meat was \"plopped\" in one place and there was at least 2 inches of bread on each end with nothing.   Our one friend ordered the sausage and pepper sub which she loved.  Her husband also ordered the cheesesteak.   For the table we had an order of arancini.  very good.  We also had French fries which were excellent.   The hostess sets the tone for a meal. Sadly, she did not impress or set a good tone.   You definitely need more menus.  You cannot expect 4 people to share one menu."}
{"text":"Me and my hubby were on date night and we were going to go to olive garden but decided to stop at Time Square for the first time. This place is delicious, the staff is great, food is amazing. You have to try all the FOOD, my mouth was in heaven watering and wondering when I should come back"}
{"text":"The food here is fairly good; however, the customer service is atrocious....specifically their takeout and the lady who claims to be their manager with the short pixie haircut.  We have ordered takeout from them about 5 times and EVERY time it has been a debacle.  The young girls they had running the front desk could not even count change and once we ordered a philly cheese steak and received a cheeseCAKE slice.  When alerting the manager nicely she acted like it was my mistake and she was doing me a favor by giving me the cheesecake, even thought half my order and myself then had to wait 15 min for the cheese steak.  This last time, which will be our last time, we arrived at the 15 minute mark as instructed and I waited over 30 min to get my order.  The said manager looked over at me standing there more than 3 times and never once came over to check on things or apologize for the ridiculous wait.  When it finally arrived I asked it it was just cooked and the new young man behind the desk said no, it came out a while ago, but I had to come up here for the ticket and then bag it......so it sat there for 30 min while I stood there waiting for it.  We tried and tried to give this place a chance since its basically in our back yard, but I am over waisting my time and money.  Absurd!"}
{"text":"Here's another Yelp! first for me. Times Square Neighborhood Italian Restaurant made such a good first impression that my girlfriend and I ate a second meal there before I could write my first review. And we brought along family to introduce them on our second visit. I've only been familiar with Times Square for about one week, but I guarantee I know more about their menu than those who are bashing this place over the pizza.  For whatever reason, I've always had a rule regarding Italian Restaurants. Don't order the pizza. That could be because what Americans consider pizza, isn't really Italian. That and there is so much more good stuff to be had! Hello?! The first descriptor on the sign after \"Times Square\" is \"Seafood\". No wonder you didn't enjoy your pizza...  Times Square is a new, very clean, bright, wide open restaurant with a glass divider between the bar and the rest of the dining room. It's got a classy, yet casual atmosphere. And the north windows slide open to expand the bar, presumably when the weather permits. And the weather is on the verge of permitting.  The food is the reason we came back so soon. And the Black Mussels appetizer has to be the best dish of mussels we have ever enjoyed. They were fresh, plump and perfectly cooked in an amazing red sauce.  We split an entree (Linguini Principessa) that featured shrimp and clams and the best pasta I've ever tasted. I'd swear they were making their own pasta. And again, the seafood in the entree was beautifully cooked and so fresh. Did I mention the generous portion? It was plenty for the two of us.  On the second visit, we started with the Fried Calamari. The breading was light and the spiral cut Calamari was plump and tasty. Two more orders of the Principessa were enjoyed while I ventured out to try the Wild Mushroom Ravioli. Again, the pasta was amazing while the mushroom filling was earthy and delicious!  Bottom line is, leave pizza to the pizza joints. Get into Times Square and try the pasta or seafood. Or both."}
{"text":"I literally live right around the corner and have been watching this like a hawk waiting to open!  We went around 5:30 on a Saturday night and got seated right away.  We definitely beat the rush as it got really busy after that. First impressions of the restaurant itself are ...it's a cute, casual place, I think because of the menu and bar I was expecting a bit nicer place but it's ok, we like our casual spots too. Service was good, especially considering how busy it was, but several of the servers (not ours) seemed very grumpy with their customers. All the dishes we ordered were good.  The Eggplant Sorrentina was out of this world and it will be hard for me to order anything else off the menu because it was so tasty.  The menu is quite extensive.  Prices are pretty reasonable.  Garlic bread was just ok. I think the worst offense was the side salad.  When we asked how much it was to add a dinner salad our server told us $2, so when they arrived we were happy with them.  But actually we were charged $4 each and it is not worth it. I really miss the days when the salad was included as part of the meal.  When you're paying $13+ for a big plate of pasta, $4 is absolutely ridiculous for a tiny dinner salad. But the flavors are great so we will be returning!  Can't wait to see what else they have to offer...just stay away from the side salad unless you like throwing money away."}
{"text":"So I have been to all of the Times Square restaurants and I know this one is the newest of them all. I bring my family to these restaurants all the time. The food is always great! Tonight the service was terrible. We got there and we asked to be seated outside. After getting seated outside by the manager we sat outside for 20 min before anyone came and took our drink order. There was 6 of us. After taking our order and everyone got their food they forgot my dish completely! I told her she had forgot it. I had the spinach linguine which is a $15.00 dish. The money is not the point. The waitress didn't ask me if I even if I still wanted it, she just rushed in and what seamed to be had them make me my dish which was fine. At this point I had already ate 2 slices of my kids white pizza and was full. The waitress brought me my food finally and acted like nothing happened. The managers didn't even come over to confirm that everything was alright. Once again not about the money but I was still charged for my plate I didn't even take a bite out of. After still leaving a tip the bill was over $80.00 which I feel like if I'm paying this much for food the service should match. Just to reiterate the food was fantastic at least the white pizza..... I will be back in the future and I hope the lack of service does not persist. I would have left 5 stars but at this point I'm just rating the food. Food=****, Service=*."}
{"text":"Maybe I was expecting more  Times Square Italian Restaurant is a newly opened Italian eatery close by the Ace Hardware Store, in Litchfield Park. Times Square is very clean, has great parking access, plenty of srating, and the service is very attentive and genuine.   Times Square has a large menu offering breakfast, lunch and dinner. On both my visits we opted for take out, and ordered large pepperoni pizzas and cannolis.  I have to be honest the pizza was just okay. There just wasn't anything special about it. Maybe, I was expecting more. In my opinon, the pizza could use a boost in seasoning and a little more time in the oven,  on both occasions the pizza was a little soggy. Even though the pizza was just kind of average; I do have to say that the cannolis were pretty good.   Maybe, I will revisit soon and try something else maybe a pasta dish."}
{"text":"The food here has always been good...not great...just good. However, on each and every visit the service is always subpar. No utensils. No napkins. No refills. We inevitably have to ask our waitress/waiter for these items. At times, these individuals are no where to be found and we have to ask the busboy. If you come expect good food...poor service."}
{"text":"While we still do enjoy going here, because it's so close to home. The food is pretty good, we still love the mozzarella and other dishes. Creme brûlée is also good! They seem to be understaffed and service is on the slow side."}
{"text":"Just tried the east valley location and what can I say, I'm impressed. It is about time we have a decent restaurant on the west side.  Same owners, hoping same level of customer service and quality of fare.  The seafood was fresh and plentiful. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. Calamari was in steaks, not rings and the marinara was chunky and fresh. Yessssss....."}
{"text":"I've been here many many times since it's recent opening and always been very satisfied with the food, prices, and service but tonight's experience exceeded my expectations, mainly in part because of my lovely waitress who I believe name is Brandy. Her compassion and kindness meant the world as I had just lost a family member hours prior. She had no idea, she could just tell I was upset and went above \"the call of action\" if you will.   Times Square has not only gotten a lifelong patron but I'll be telling everyone I know about how great the food and service is.   Onto the food/pros: *The ravioli and chicken parm are to die for! *If you like thin crust New York style pizza this is your place!  *Full size bar and patio. *Spacious with plenty of seating.   Staff is always friendly, courteous, and quick."}
{"text":"This place always delivers, in terms of food and service. Lots of variety on the menu including breakfast choices. Good casual ambience. Great addition of Italian restaurant on the West side."}
{"text":"Was so darn excited to have a new restaurant by my house and was hopeful it would provide some quality, home cooking. Unfortunately, as you can assume, I was really let down. My visit took place mid week, during lunch hour, with a couple co-workers. Upon entering, I was impressed with the restaurant set up and seeing a couple televisions showing a baseball game never disappoints a sports fan. Sadly, that was the only positive to our visit. The hostess/our waitress sat up promptly and then disappeared. We waited for some time to get waters and she seemed uninterested/annoyed in taking our orders. As for our meals, they had mussels and pizza and were not impressed. I too ordered some individual pizza slices and they were not good. I was so wishing I was at Bruno's at that moment. The pizza is hard to describe. I have thought and thought and I will just leave it at not good. The icing on the cake for me was the ranch I requested to dip my pizza in. I have never had a dressing so watered down. It literally had the consistency of water. Overall, so disappointed in having to say that I will not be back to the place I was so excited to have near me. Bummer."}
{"text":"Both breakfast and lunch, we get excellent food and service! The restaurant is clean, welcoming and the open kitchen is very fun to watch! Our pizzas (buffalo chicken & NY Combo) were excellent! The best part is when the manager (Mario) comes by and treats you like family! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Not up to the same quality or standard as the one in North Phoenix. Just mediocre compared to the other location near the 101 and Deer Valley"}
{"text":"Wanted to give this place another chance, unfortunately, they fell short. Food was bland and service was slow (and they weren't even busy)!"}
{"text":"Our favorite go to for breakfast, yes breakfast! Lunch or dinner. Great choices and good sized portions, enough to share. Service is good depending on the day I guess. We have a favorite waitress that knows what we order already and makes us feel comfortable. Our kids love love love the pizza! Thin crust and not greasy. It's a great having this place in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"A really great place to eat and relax. The food is also extremely good. From Sunday Brunch to happy hour my wife and I would give them 10 Stars."}
{"text":"PLEASE for the love of God DO NOT EAT HERE!!!  This place deserves -5 stars and should be put out of business!!!   Let me explain...  I went to dinner with my BF, we were promptly greeted and seated. The woman with blonde hair (guessing she is the owners wife) was very nice, asked if we had been there before and I said no. She said that all of the food was homemade and to enjoy. I was really hopeful, really...  I opened the menu and to my surprise saw a breakfast menu (that should have been clue number 1!).  We ordered the Arancini as an appetizer, it came out and looked really good. I expected it to be super hot being that Arancini is a fried food. I was a little surprised that no steam came out upon digging my fork in. Upon tasting it I was sadly disappointed...  It was Luke warm/cold and tasted like ricaroni mixed with canned peas and carrots and a tiny bit of who knows what kind of meat, it fell apart, those familiar with Arancini just know...  any how, I kept taking little bites and all of a sudden burnt my mouth!!!  WTF?!?!  These were MICROWAVED!!!  Nobody would admit it when asked, they said they were fried then put in the oven, YEAH, MICROWAVE OVEN!!!!  The owner ended up taking it off the bill, great!  Next came dinner, I ordered the Pescatore. It came, looked beautiful!  I was so hopeful. I took a bite of the calamari and spit it right out!  It was the most rubbery disgusting piece of previously frozen, over cooked garbage I have ever had!!!  The muscles and clams weren't THAT bad, but also previously frozen. Even the pasta was previously cooked!!!  WTH?  Homemade?  A week ago? From dumpster diving?!?!  Right!  The owner offered to give me a dessert...  a DESSERT?!?!  For my $22 plate of garbage?  Is that frozen too?!?!  Please save your money!!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and well prepared, the service was fast and not intrusive. Both our meals came with big long pieces of crusty garlic bread, which really made it for me. Totally recommend."}
{"text":"Chicken Penne a la Vodka is to die for! Every time I go back no matter what, when or why? The Food is equally as good! Very consistent, very Fresh and you can taste the quality in every bite. One of Arizona best kept secret!"}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant for the first time on March 25th to give it a try.  The décor reminds us of the 1950's  basic & bland diners: bare walls and less than comfy booths with  leather seats so hard that felt a bit like sitting on wood.  The waiting service was helpful and cheerful.    Our food was good and the portions generous.  My Eggplant Parmigiano was delicious.  My spouse was less impressed with his Chicken Piccata. He did not care for the noodles served with it.   Our main critique is that the food was not hot  We understand that \" Times Square\"  is making a good effort to be as Italian as possible but we are not sure that we need or expect that much pasta  served with everything here in the US.  Is it perhaps a more economical substitute for pricier veggies?  We'll surely go back because their menu is varied and we want to try out other dishes."}
{"text":"We came for breakfast.  Everything was fine.   The main issue here is that the prices on our check were not those presented on the menu or on the web site.  The staff corrected the issue with a quick explanation that implied they were aware of the issue (but didn't tell us when they gave us the menu).  I looked across the restaurant and, based on what people ordered, was sure that everyone was being overcharged by almost 25%.  This is deceptive and unacceptable, especially for a chain."}
{"text":"We dined there for first time. Ambience is nice, waitress was new but nice. Pizza to be honest is not that good. Ground Control is much better, even Barros. I had the Philly Cheese steak which was just ok. They need to add some sauce or marinade the steak a bit more. My wife had the Turkey ham and bacon which actually was pretty good. We also had the wings which tasted rubbery. We're going to try their breakfast, but dinner is average at Times Square. Also, they only give a military discount for the member and not the whole ticket. That is too bad."}
{"text":"Well.. we didn't eat here but we're just checking out for menu. We came in last Saturday's afternoon and sign says \"Please wait to be seated.\" No one came until one other Caucasian's customer arrived and we have been waiting for almost 8 minutes. Someone actually came out and directly greeted the new customer. My husband politely asked if they have paper menu that we can have, after entertained the new customer. She gave us short instructions to check them on website. We said Thank you and left. Do we want to go back here? NO! You can have great food but if my skin color dictates if I can eat here, that's definitely very sad! Racism is real. Location: 13760 W Camelback Rd #70, Litchfield Park, AZ 85340."}
{"text":"Today is a beautiful January day, 70 degrees and FRIDAY AFTERNOON!  Came by Times to enjoy the afternoon and stay outside to enjoy the weather.  Nope.  Patio is closed.   I have been a faithful customer for over a year.  Their patio needs to be open whenever the weather is this nice.  Getting lazy over there. Amanda, the manager, is not very friendly to people, in general.  God forbid you ask for a heater to be turned on or apparently, even asking for their patio to be open at all.  Not cool, management."}
{"text":"Very tasty Italian food.  I had the Giovanni pasta plate and my husband had the lasagne.... great portion sizes.  Ate our fill and had lunch for tomorrow!  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and alcoholic drink choices. But felt rushed to leave as there were a lot of customers waiting to be seated. Next time maybe we'll sit at the bar or the table tops."}
{"text":"Stopped in over the weekend for a late dinner with my fiance. Hostess told us larger tables are reserved for bigger parties when we asked for a booth which was not great customer service. However we were helped immediately after that when someone said something to her. Food was good. Service was excellent. Only other bummer was the credit card machine was down when we went to pay so they had to go old school and write it down. Manager also checked on us which is always a plus in my book."}
{"text":"This is my first visit here. I was a little nervous to try it because the reviews weren't what I wanted them to be. But I came in for the lunch special and ordered the Rigatoni Arrabiata with Chicken and wasn't disappointed AT ALL! I needed to add more pepper flakes just because I'm from Louisiana and I need more spice in my life! Lol. But other than that I had an amazing experience! Terry was my server and he was amazing! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that's looking to meet up either after work, for lunch, or even for relaxed family dinner."}
{"text":"My first visit to Times Square was last week for a late lunch service was good and I've been two more times for the mediterranean salad. I'm not sure about the pasta yet. I know they were very busy when I was there Saturday fir take out and had several new people working so be kind when you go everyone needs a chance..."}
{"text":"Had to pick up a screen from ACE Hardware so stopped in for Sunday breakfast during Cardinals game. They advertise \"every live game every Sunday\" with Bloody Mary and mimosa bar. It's a great concept to offer breakfast until 1 pm and a Bloody Mary/mimosa bar. However, They need to staff up to  back up that advertisement. No one at the host stand. The busboy told us open seating in the bar but had to get our own menus. The bartender was very nice but overwhelmed. She was handling a large crowd all by herself. She was the bartender, the server, the stocker of the bar, busing tables, clearing payments, etc. felt bad for her but she kept a smile on. The manager did not jump in and help her much.  He never checked on us either.  Water would be have been nice but thought I would have to get it myself as I saw many people from tables going up to the bar to ask for things. Another server brought food out for her but was complaining about it and didn't follow up. No one did. The food is great although no one asked or checked on us at all after we got our drinks. I would have rated higher if they had better service."}
{"text":"Walking up I began to be excited as it is jam packed with people spilling out of the door! Woman at the front door has attitude as I said hello and she looked as if I spit on her. Doesn't take too long to be seated which was shocking. The wife chose to sit us outside on the patio as we had a party of 10, and usually I dislike patios because your forgotten about.   Water comes quick, but appetizers take awhile. Refills on those waters didn't come either. We ordered white and red mussels, I preferred the white as it had a nice smooth garlic butter flavor. Calamari was crispy and I appreciated the breeding not falling off as soon as it hit the sauce.   Considering the amount of food that was ordered the entrees didn't take too long. My daughter and I decided to share the Pasta Giovanni house fav, and in my opinion I enjoyed the flavors but I added some spice! We weren't impressed with the lasagna as the sauce tasted very store bought, and the pasta was not cooked fully. The gnocchi was mediocre at best, shaped like marshmallows. The Linguini Principressa was delicious however as my nephew ordered it and the entire table ate it.   Service was ok, our waitress was nervous due to the size of our table which is completely ok not a big deal at all. As our entrees were brought out I requested an additional plate as I was sharing. The woman delivering the plates of food (not the waitress) didn't acknowledge me whatsoever and kept moving about the table. As she finished with plating everyone, I excused myself again and requested an additional plate because I was sure she didn't hear me as she was busy. She then replied very rudely, \"so now you need two!? To go along with the plate you asked for earlier!\" That pissed me off and basically bothered me for the rest of the night....   Overall food tasted alright.....priced ok but servings didn't match the price and could be seen as high(charged additional 7.50 to add cheese to an order) finally attitudes need to be adjusted for a new restaurant I was expecting some happy people especially since they were super busy during dinner."}
{"text":"My husband had a bad experience with his  dinner I share this with the owner I'm a little disappointed in the results I got when I talked with him I didn't get a letter of apology which we never received or compensate us for a dinner. You need to follow through I will not be going back to Times Square for a while or maybe ever again I have been here three times this last time was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight!!! Big mistake, pizza was under cooked and disgusting. Stomach is already feeling the effects!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad they opened up one on the Westside close to me. Very good options for Italian cuisine. Large portion size for leftovers. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great pizza. The staff made placing my order nice, quick and easy. Service from time of pick up to ending of transaction was very pleasant. The pizza was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!  I had the Tortellini D Angelo, cheese filled tortellini with mushrooms and chicken and hubby had Pescatore, seafood pasta for dinner.  We had bruschetta for appetizer and raspberry martini and margarita.  It was all fantastic.  This seems to be a nice little neighborhood fave and a gem of a secret!  Upscale food in a relaxed environment. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"1st time here this evening.  The service was awful, the food was cold with a piece of hair & flying gnats around the restaurant & in our food.  Over priced for a veal that tasted like chicken .  Food temperature was cold.  I had the Baked Ziti & waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much ricotta cheese, cold, not enough marinara sauce.   The waitress didn't check up on us not even once & no refill drinks.  The sun was glaring into the restaurant even with some sun shades down. I can over hear some other guests complaining about their food.  But just like us, we wanted to get out of there (though we sat there for a good 15 mins with no food at our table until the check came) just like them, I would NOT recommend this place.  & for a small restaurant that is trying to do well.  Start with the service & like real chefs check your food before you send it out to your guest(s) to the table.  Horrible 1st time and last time visit. Especially when I was looking forward to it, being so close to my brand new home."}
{"text":"OK doesn't really describes this place perfectly. I have been here on a number of occasions, and what I found was decidedly inconsistent.  The building itself is relatively new and the space is kept clean, so kudos for that. There is also an outdoor seating  area which is nice when the sun isn't melting the asphalt.  There is good, bad and ugly about this place, so it that order:  Good: The cheese steaks are really well done. I had the onions and peppers (substituted green for red which I prefer) and the sandwich was really, really good.   They have an awesome Bloody Mary Bar on Sunday, with a combination of mixes, fruits and veggies. The smartly keep the bacon behind the bar, but it is available. Additionally, the had three different Mimosa mixes out, in case you want to go that route, including a Mango option.  Their pizzas are good, but tend to be on the under cooked side. Their dough is nice, but the sauce could use some pep.  Their fried Mozzarella app is delicious and unique in that it is a slab and not sticks or nuggets. The marinara is a tad on the bland side though.  Bad: No sides come with any of their sandwiches. The only side on the menu that one would normally consider with a sandwich are battered fries. I dislike battered fries...fries are best au natural. No onion rings, chips etc...  Their meatball hoagie is another hit and miss. The meatballs are good, but the sauce trends bland and they don't put enough on it, so the sandwich is dry feeling.  The tomato cream sauce on their tortellini dish has a fishy undertone (maybe anchovy?) which I did not care for at all. If there is no anchovy in it, then I don't know where that note comes from.  No giardineira. These sandwiches just scream for that.  Because they serve breakfast until 1 PM on the weekends and the eggs are cooked on the same grill as the cheese steaks, no cheese steaks or pastrami sandwiches until after 1. So, for most people, no cheese steak for lunch on the weekends here.  Ugly:  An open kitchen is nice, until you see the cook swiping his cell phone with his gloved hands. Defeats the purpose of the gloves and I don't want to know what could be lurking on his screen. I just hope our food was already cooked."}
{"text":"This was super good!  Enjoyed the lunch special fettucine with meat sauce (it has a name just cant think of it!), delicius.  Can't wait to go back and try the pasta with seafood."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place with amazing services there is pizza pasta seafood and phenomenal menu the waiters are kind and chefs do great work on food.  The first time I thought service was amazing it is small and doesn't look like much but inside is a great experience for kids and adults. They have amazing Breakfast lunch and dinner and a very wide choice of all food. They insisted on doing EVERYTHING for you. I recommend this place for all   ages they have great entertainment"}
{"text":"Water down no flavor ice tea Service So So Food Fish&Chips Mediocre Cioppino only had two shrimp in it so so   Calamari over cooked  like Chewing onrubber bands"}
{"text":"Living near the area we decided to have lunch here and our service here was horrible. It took the waiter forever to take our drink order, because him and the waitress were complaining in the back glass area. I actually think he finally brought out our refills before our check was delivered. As for the food, it did not meet our expectations. The calzone was cold inside with the cheese not even melted all the way, not to mention raviolis flavor was not there. I feel like we over paid for what they deliver. Check out other restaurants around the area that have the great customer service and prices. We definitely will not be back!"}
{"text":"Four out of four diners really enjoyed the meals. The pasta giavanni was terrific. Salmon and scallops were very good as was the veal parm. The only critical comment would be the soup although very tasty was served only luke warm. After reheating it was fine."}
{"text":"Pizza was great! We ordered a huge carry out for a party of 25 on the fly and they nailed it! Meatballs, Sausage, pasta etc. all very good."}
{"text":"Oh my!!!!  Just had the privilege of devouring the most amazing calzone.  Design your own with ricotta and mozzarella cheese.  Perfect proportions.  Friendly service, clean, relaxed atmosphere.  Hubbys tortellini just as amazing!!!  Chef also came out and introduced himself!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"We've been waiting for Times Square to open this new location. It was well worth the wait with an extensive menu (even including breakfast) offering a variety of dishes to suit any palette. The service was very good even as the restaurant began to get busy with the 5 o'clock dinner guests. I try to order my standard baked ziti w/ meatballs to compare against other places we enjoy.  Scrumptious!  Loved it!  The Mrs. brought half of her very delicious ravioli home. I don't think she plans on sharing.  Welcome to the West Valley!  No doubt we'll be back, with friends, and often."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch yesterday (Tuesday) around 1115. The place was decently packed but we didn't have any problem being sat quickly. (We had a party of 8.) the waitress was great very friendly and attentive. She explained how they made all food (expect for two of the sauces) to order. The food I received was very good. I opted for the lunch portion of Aglio E Olio pasta with sausage. It was linguine noodles tossed with garlic, oregano, olive oil and the sausage. It came with garlic bread which was also really good. Based on the taste of the food and the very friendly server I would be back. The wait to get our food did take a little while, but that is to be expected when the food is fresh and made to order. Other perk of made to order is the fact that we can alter the ingredients if you don't like something or want something else. All in all this place was a good find close to our office, so I definitely see my team coming back. Another perk is they offer a military discount. (Thank you for that! Not all places do.)"}
{"text":"Just opened up. This is one of three restaurants in the Phoenix area. Last time I had the cheese steak with fries and pizza. Both were excellent and I used to work at a Philadelphia restaurant.   They are also open for breakfast. Today I ordered the steak with eggs and substituted the toast for biscuit and gravy. I don't doubt it will be great."}
{"text":"5 of my family members & I came here for dinner. The food wasn't good & the waitress crystal wasn't nice. When we asked her for things (which wasn't much at all), she acted as if we bothered her. We won't be back here again."}
{"text":"We love this place. Tonight I got something I usually don't get and although it was good, I'm not crazy about meat and there was bacon in it. I still enjoyed it but didn't finish it. The manager asked if I wanted a box or if I didn't like it. I explained to her it was fine I just wasn't crazy about the bacon in it. She took 10 dollars off our bill. Just because. It was not expected and we appreciated it so much!  These people care about their customers and the experience. We will be back! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Wow. Food - excellent, fresh, authentic. This place is CLEAN!! Service - ladies...you will not be ignored for larger parties.  No tip hounds here.  I came here after work and there were larger parties at the bar.  I got equal treatment.  Very refreshing.  And they have breakfasts.. And I just learned they have a bloody Mary bar on weekends for breakfast.......ima get my mimosa on!  jeff - you rock.  Class act!"}
