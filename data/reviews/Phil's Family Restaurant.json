{"text":"My wife and I had been happy \"regulars\" at the Douglas family restaurant before Phil became its new proprietor. He did the former owners proud: the peameal  bacon is larger and more tender than at most breakfast restaurants; the eggs come in any way you like; the fruit bowl is fresh, made to order and surprisingly inexpensive; and the service is personal and friendly. To top it all, not only is Phil a great cook: so is his son Justin. Just ask him to add feta cheese to his signature vegetarian omelette!"}

{"text":"I'm new to the city so I needed to find my new breakfast joint. You know, the kind of place where you feel at home enough to go there with sleep head and sweat pants. I think I found it at Phils. Honestly, It's worth going there just for the coffee. The portion sizes were great, the food was delicious and the prices were very fair. Not a lot of room for improvement but I would comment on a couple of things. Firstly, there was only one server and although she did a great job it's impossible to give \"urgent\" service when you're babysitting 10 or more tables at once. Our coffee cups didn't get refilled a second time until the food arrived and we had her full attention. As well, I only found out they served rye toast because a regular had phoned his order in and she announced it when she put it on the table. When I asked why she hadn't offered rye toast as an option to me she was quite bewildered as to why she hadn't. I guess \"white or brown\" just has a nicer ring to it.   These small infractions in no way will deter me from going back. We'll see you soon."}
{"text":"Very decent breakfast place.   I visited this joint over the weekend with some friends. We enjoyed a few specials including the farmers omelette, eggs Benedict with regular bacon and grilled cheese + bacon and fries.   I have to say, their home fries are yummy! You don't feel heavy after eating them knowing they were saut√©ed on the grill, not deep fried.   The farmers omelette is where it's at! Applewood smoked bacon, farmers sausage, cheddar cheese, peppers, tomato and I think onion. Maybe something else in there too. Either way, it was delicious. I don't often order omelettes but the force was strong with this one. I was one happy girl that morning.   One last thought about Phil's that I think is lovely is the fresh fruit bowl. I peeked into a friends bowl and saw it was filled with strawberries, raspberries, cantaloupe and bananas. Mmm.   Bill came to just over $25 with tip and tax included."}
