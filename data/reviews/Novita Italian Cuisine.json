{"text":"Went there on Monday for dinner. The restaurant was very quite, probably because it's a Monday night.   We ordered a Mixed Seafood plate and Grilled Calamari for appetizers. I would say 'not impressive' for both dishes. The Mixed Seafood had a fishy smell despite they're cooked in a tasty balsamic reduced sauce.  The Grilled calamari was....just bland. We also had 2 pizzas. They're both disappointing. The pizza sauce had basically no taste.   Then comes the entrées, which were better. We had a Risotto with Seafood and a Gnocchi with Lemon Creamy Sauce. The risotto was very tasty and the seafood in it was a totally different grade than in the the appetizer. We even ordered a second plate to share. The gnocchi itself was too mushy to my liking, but the lemon cream sauce saved the day.   Service was friendly, but not too attentive. It was our waiter who brought us to our table. We had made reservation, but they were apparently not prepared when we arrived. The restaurant was empty when we get there, but our waiter had to move tables together to seat us. Throughout the night, we have to ask for everything from serving utensils to clean plates after appetizers. And we have to go look for him in the restaurant to get our bill. However, he's very friendly and nice.   Lastly, I used their online system to make a reservation. However, they never called me back to confirm. So I have to call. Told them what happened, doesn't seemed to be a concern to them. Again, a little disappointed."}
{"text":"Took a chance with a new restaurant and celebrated a dear friend's birthday. I have a hard time finding a good Italian restaurant in Markham. Either restaurants in the area are over priced or so tucked away between buildings we end up giving up looking for it. Well, I think I found a new to-go place for my Italian food fixing. Plenty of parking and easy to find right on highway 7. The restaurant use to be Fire and Ice which was a local favourite.   Starter We ordered the grill calamari and we got three big head of squid nicely sliced but still presentably attached together. The garnish of mix salad greens, caramelized onions, olives and large capers were the best part. I highly recommend this dish!   Main Course We all ended up with a veal dish; Parmigiano (really big), Vitello Gorgonzola (Amazing white wine butter sauce) and the Vitello Marsala (a full body mushroom sauce). We were served 3 slices of veal but each dish's meat size were really different. If you're hungry go with the Parmigiano but I just loved my deliciously creamy Piccata Di Vitello which small but I didn't care. Like any great Italian dish, you should be asking for more bread to soak up the sauce. A sign of a great chef is working in the back.    Dessert/Staff Sorry, I didn't like the tiramisu. It was big but didn't taste right. It was as if the cake was left in the fridge for too long and not enough mascarpone. Like I was eating a dry cake. Our server was ok. Maybe it was the cold weather but I honestly don't care. Desserts and service can be easily improved. If I wanted dessert, I would hit a bakery. After all, I'm here for the main course. Hey, maybe they were having a bad dessert day.  This restaurant is a great addition to Markham. There's plenty of room and a great place to hold large gatherings. They have a vast menu so we will be back soon to eat more!"}
{"text":"We started off with some complimentary bread, which was alright (mainly maybe because I expected that the bread would be warm). It was a little stale and hard.  We ordered the fried calamari as an appetizer. It also came with some spinach chips and aioli on the side. It was soo good!! We were super hungry so we devoured it immediately. The spinach chips were a great addition!   I ordered the Salmone Affumicato Penne, which is Norwegian salmon, vodka fresh chives in rose sauce. I opted for angel hair pasta instead of the penne though. It was good! The presentation was sloppy and there was sauce all over the bowl. I had to wipe it down to take a picture lol. There was a good amount of salmon and there was a good amount of sauce.  K ordered the Pollo Linguine Alfredo, which is tender chicken cooked in a traditional Alfredo sauce finished with parmigiano cheese. I actually liked this sauce a lot. It was super rich but not too creamy. However, the chicken was really hard and dry, which my sister wasn't a fan of.  Overall, I had a good time here. It wasn't too busy, so the restaurant was rather quiet. I can see it getting really loud though when it's a full house. Service was alright. Our server was really attentive in the beginning but slacked off after we got our mains. I had to ask for more water from another server and then waited for another 15 minutes until my server came by and asked what I needed. That was a little ridiculous. As for the food, the pastas were good but I wouldn't say it's the best in the area. But with that said, I would come back if I had a serious pasta craving."}
{"text":"A great venue for events with excellent food and very friendly staff. We had our son's first birthday party there and chef/owner Raj was very nice and accommodating. He prepared a set menu to our liking and budget, was very flexible with little extras like printing the set menus, birthday cake and decorations. He even personally brought out the cake. The staff is super friendly and very helpful. The event was everything we had hoped for and even more! They have the best pizza and grilled calamari in town!! We also had shrimp linguini and grilled chicken on our menu and got excellent feedback from our guests. Highly recommended! P.S not such a big fan of the veal though"}
{"text":"I was there with my family tonight , all of us are very please with their quality food and wonderful service.  For sure we will go back again."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here. We ordered the set ($18) that came with an appetizer, main entre and dessert, a great deal!! Also tried ordered a pizza and pasta. The food was tasty and good. Service was excellent. Good value for money. Will come back again"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Tuesday night and it was definately a nice find. Upon entry you will find a nice open area--open seating, open kitchen; all of which is newly renovated and modern. Plus there is quite a high ceiling making it feel even more open.  The restaurant gave us two types of complimentary bread paired with a olive oil, vinegar, and herb mixture. Can't complain. We got: Penne Del Mare which was penne pasta with shrimp, scallops, spinach in a tomato cream sauce. The pasta itself was just a minute or two undercooked making it harder than it should have been. The scallops were huge and cooked well like the shrimp. The sauce was amazing! Full of flavour and creaminess.  Linguine Del Mare which was linguine with shrimp, mussels, calamari in a tomato sauce. A pretty standard pasta dish. The sauce however stayed true to the fresh tomato flavour and was cooked with baby clams which gave it some more taste.  Risotto with Scallops, Shrimp, Spinach and Pesto was really good. The sauce is comparable to the Penne Del Mare in terms of its texture but the pesto in this dish really made a different. The taste of basil paired excellent with it.  Finished off with a Tiramisui. Nothing special about dessert.   As you can tell we are seafood lovers. We also ordered an Espresso Martini (average) and a nice Rose white wine.  I would definately come back to try some other dishes with different proteins.  Service was great. It's still a new restaurant and the manager came out to greet us and chat a little bit."}
{"text":"Wow was this place underwhelming. I had a sangria with white wine to drink and ordered from their savour york region menu. I had the shrimp diavola appetizer, seafood linguine, and \"creme brulee\". Everything was under seasoned and kind of bland. The pasta wasn't fresh which is disappointing because when I go to an Italian restaurant, I expect fresh pasta.   The portions were big but I ended up wasting food because it was so plain I didn't want to eat it.  The \"creme brulee\" was a flan, not creme brulee. It was also the saddest dessert I've ever seen. They had taken it out of the container they baked it in and flipped it (like you do for a flan) but it didn't quite come out clean so there were pieces missing which is not too pretty.  Also, I don't understand the whipped cream and gooseberry and mint leaf decoration. It doesn't look good and doesn't add to the dessert.  My partner had cauliflower quinoa ball appetizer, seafood linguine, and Panna cotta.  The appetizer was okay, it was like arancini. Panna cotta was okay to but nothing special.  Overall, the food wasn't good and definitely not anything to come back for. If you're starving and not too picky about Italian food then I guess it's passable. The pasta was so bleh I ate the seafood and left the pasta on the plate. Oh well, only paid $25 for appetizer, entree and dessert."}
{"text":"I came here on a whim just from being hungry and driving by for lunch. Was an excellent surprise, found the interior decor amazing as well as the service. The menu was extensive but not overpopulated, and seemed to be genuine Italian. Prices are fair, and the food tastes great. Can't go wrong if you're looking for Italian !"}
{"text":"Outstanding gone great gone good gone terrible and now never going back!!  And after today's experience I feel compelled to YELP!!  My first experience was outstanding, food was so good it was worth the high prices.  The service was excellent and we were a large party so the waiter informed us there would be a gratuity charged to each bill.  Second and third experience was great; food still tasty and service was good.  But it was not outstanding.   After that it seems to have gone down hill for me.  But today was not only disappointing food wise, the service was terrible and it ended with a disgusting blow.  I requested easy on the dressing and I was given the exact opposite.  I love Caesar salads and their dressing is particularly tasty except today as it was like drinking my salad; it was completely drenched in dressing.  I asked for mushrooms to be added to my pasta main course and of course the waitress forgot it.  And I ordered the same dish as my last 2 visits; it has definitely lost its spark. It was borderline good.  When my meal arrived I asked for a takeout box and the waitress replied, \" I will bring you one later when I bring it for the others.  I informed her I wanted the box right away and she ignore my request.    When the waitress took dessert orders, she asked each person at the table for their order and walked away before asking me.  Upon her return to the table I requested for a latte, and she replied, \"well I will get it later\".  Clearly customer service is not one of her strengths, even though she works in the hospitality industry.  But to end the evening with an appalling incident.  We were a table of 8 and we were not informed of gratuity.  The waitress saw that we were all chatting and she brought us the bills and literally shoved the machine in our faces to have us pay.  As we entered into the machine, she made no mention that gratuity was added.  Basically she doubled her tip! She ripped us off and made at least $100 off the table.  And then she tried to take the itemized bill from the table so we don't notice.  I had to ask for her to leave my bill.  I know one person and one experience doesn't represent the entire restaurant but I will not go back to that restaurant....that was morally incorrect and it's terrible knowing that there are disgusting people out there."}
{"text":"Nice place and acceptable price. Big place. This is a new one on the highway 7.offer online reservation service, very convenient."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 10 people to celebrate a birthday. We made a reservation but somehow our reservation was lost. But it was no problem, they put us at a table quickly and the owner came out to apologize too.  Food:  Generous portion.  We sampled a variety of dishes including the price fixe menu. Everyone enjoyed it especially calamari.   Service: Great service, the food didn't take long and it came out at relatively the same time.   Decor: Nice, comfortable atmosphere  https://www.instagram.com/p/BE60uERponP/"}
{"text":"Food was ok, nothing special and way overpriced. The restaurant itself had many flaws ie there were power cords hanging from the ceiling and walls. There was dirt all over the walls.  The wait staff were also fighting with each other while on the floor."}
{"text":"I like Italian food a lot and there are so many other places serve authentic italian food with professional service compare with here.  Food are not bad but just not good enough with this price.   I don't like the service there. The server we had  is not professional at all. When there is empty plates, she never take it away. However, when we are still eating, she keep asking if we are done yet.  We stay there for a while but the restaurant was not busy. Lots of empty table that night.  First time of my life that a server tell me that if we are not done yet then she will go out for a smoke first.  I thought I was eating at a bar or keraoke.  Her name is Deanna as I remember."}
{"text":"The gnocchi was really good, really creamy. Too heavy for one person to finish on their own.   Bruschetta was good, fresh, and I really liked their bread.  I am the pickiest person in the world about service, and it was terrible. Stick me in a corner and give me dirty cups, take forever to take my order then almost drop my food?? No thanks."}
{"text":"It's an amazing experience here when I came with a few of my friends. Up in Markham it's a dime a dozen to find a good restaurant at a reasonable price, let alone italian. The owner, Rajah, is very passionate about his kitchen and staff and the service was amazing.   Food proportions were very generous, and the cakes were just scrumptious!!  Would definitely recommend coming again."}
{"text":"Came here for Father's Day and pleasantly surprised how good the food is. I had the seafood risotto and there were lots of jumbo shrimp and scallops inside. Pizza was also really good. Will definitely come here again"}
{"text":"Relatively new independent Italian restaurant with a patio right on hwy 7. Good location with lots of parking.  Inside is newly renovated with modern bright and high ceiling design. Pretty clean.  Good selection on wine. Sometimes they have prix fix menus that are at a good price for a three course meal.   I went twice and both times I loved their food. The owner and Chef is Roger and I'm surprised he's not Italian but nonetheless very delicious food. He did come out to introduce himself to us and asked how our food was. I enjoyed both my times there food wise.   Service wise I wasn't super pleased. First time I was sat at a horrible floating table behind a back board when the restaurant was pretty much empty. My server was always too busy for me and forgot my requests a few times. Second time I was seated by the hostess who was a bit less welcoming than she should be and I sat at the table for a good 10 mins with no server to greet me. Another server walked by and saw me but didn't even smile or say hi. So when i got frustrated i told her to get mu server of its not her. Then another server came and said she didn't see us ... she apologized but the restaurant had 4 tables ... two servers .. you didnt see us? Really?   I'd still come back to the place for the food. Hopefully my next visit I'd get better service."}
{"text":"Super yummy! Had the Pollo Capelli D'Angelo and Spaghetti & Lobster :) really happy to have a high quality Italian restaurant nearby now!    Only \"negative\" thing is I ordered hot water and at the end they charged $1.00 on the bill, labelled \"open food\". Don't really mind the $1 but would prefer a heads up next time for anything that's extra charge!  Overall, amazing experience!"}
{"text":"I always go to Italian restaurants in the GTA expecting the worst, and more often than not, I am right. I was delighted to try Novita last night, and it rapidly became one of my favourite Italian restaurants in the area.   I'm a vegetarian and was pleased to see that my options were not limited to just a Margarita pizza. I ordered the Gnocchi, which was divine in it's creamy lemon sauce, extremely well complemented with ricotta cheese. Because of their incredible prix-fixe deal that is on until the end of the month, I also got to enjoy their fresh and delicious bruschetta, had some tea, and tasted the pana cotta (not my favourite). My boyfriend had the Piera pizza, which he enjoyed but wasn't anything special - all of the ingredients were very good but it was a bit low on sauce and cheese. We were both pleased to see that the servers are happy to grate fresh parmesan when requested (unlike the powdered parm that is so common in many restaurants). Likewise, the complimentary bread and olive oil/vinegar/herbs dip was a nice addition.   Overall, I would say that Novita certainly has room for growth, but they are starting off strong! Beyond the food, the service was kind and accommodating, and the decor and atmosphere were great. I definitely recommend trying the restaurant out before August 31st if you can, the prix fixe dinner deal offers really great value."}
{"text":"Novita Italian Cuisine just recently replaced the outdated Fire & Ice restaurant and it's a great addition to the many restaurants on Hwy7. The inside of the restaurant itself was really welcoming. There was an open kitchen, the decor was modern and I felt like the high ceiling really opened up the restaurant. So my first impressions of the restaurant were great.  Being fairly brand new and going on a Monday night, there weren't that many people eating dinner at around 7pm. Every table comes with a side of bread and olive oil/balsamic vinegar for dip. I went with my parents and we had the following entries:  Shrimp, Scallop, Pesto & Spinach Risotto ($19.95) - For the price, it was really worth it. Not only was the portion size really generous, but what really surprised me was the scallops that were given to me. Most restaurants give small cheap frozen scallops, but the scallops that they gave me were legit big scallops and the entire risotto contained about three of them. The scallops weren't undercooked or rubbery. They were cooked just right. The shrimp was very well cooked too and very fresh. The only thing I think I can complain about is the sauce. There was a lot of it and it was definitely very creamy. Wasn't really a big deal to me anyways, so I definitely recommend giving this a try.  Novita Pollo ($17.95) - Novita really doesn't stop to amaze me. The chicken was very tender and wasn't chewy or tough at all. The vegetables were also cooked really nicely too. I don't usually like chunks of potatoes on the side, but they were very soft and well seasoned. I only had a few bites of this, so can't really say more than that, but it was definitely tasty!  Pollo Linguine Alfredo ($15.95) - I didn't have much of this either, but from what I tasted, the pasta was really well cooked. One thing I did absolutely appreciate about this pasta is that the Alfredo wasn't overly creamy and filling. Some restaurants add a lot of cream to their Alfredo sauce making it really heavy, but the sauce here was much light making it easier to enjoy!  We decided to have dessert as well just to indulge ourselves. What's interesting is that they didn't have a dessert menu. What they do have is a dessert tray where they lay out every single dessert that they have and show them to you in person. It was pretty cool since you could see what your dessert looked like beforehand. The only thing about this is that the server doesn't really tell you how much each are, so just be careful of the prices. We had the:  Double Chocolate Tart ($6.99) - Just gonna put this out there. This is a tart not a cake, so don't expect this to be soft and cakey. The chocolate tart surprising wasn't too sweet compared to what it looked like. The chocolate was rich and very tasty. The only real problem I had with this was that it was really hard. With a fork, it was pretty hard to dig into and eat. Other than that, it was an okay decent dessert.   Tiramisu ($6.99) - My parents had the Tiramisu and it was actually really good. Makes me kinda regret not getting that instead. There is definitely a stronger liquor and coffee flavor than most restaurant which I really appreciate. We were all pretty full after eating the entries, but eating this was very easy. It wasn't too heavy. It was very soft, but not too soggy. Dessert-wise, I definitely recommend trying their Tiramisu. It's on the pricy side, but it's definitely worth it.  Overall, I definitely recommend this restaurant to try. Even though this place just opened up, it need way more recognition than it does right now. The servers were very nice. The food was very tasty and definitely worth the price. My parents and I left the restaurant very satisfied and even my parents are gonna recommend this place to their co-workers. I will definitely come back with friends next time!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and had the breaded chicken sandwich with a ceaser salad. The portions are quite big which is great. However, I found the ceaser salad to be almost drenched in sauce, and the sandwich to be mediocre. I did try some of my friends gnocchi which was quite creamy and cheesy so would definitely want to try that next time."}
{"text":"We ordered the antipasto plate to share which was very good. Soups: Zuppa di pesce excellent. Ministrone not so outstanding.  Mains:Rack of Lamb.Good. Halibut freezer burn dry. Cod as recommended good.  Tiramisu excellent.  The big letdown was the Cappucino .there are too much milk not enough coffee.Hope this common garden variety beverage  for an Italian restaurant improves in the future.If the Cap was better it would have been 4 star"}
{"text":"We went to Novita today for work lunch.  We went in a group of six and everyone loved their food. The service is great.  The atmoshere is pleasant.  The restaraunt is very modern looking."}
{"text":"Recently gave this place a try with a group of 10. We had a reservation for 7pm on a Saturday night and it was quite quiet throughout the night.   We were seated and given our drinks and complimentary bread after ordering. However, because we were a relatively larger group, our food was not out til closer to 8pm.   Overall, my table had ordered a variety of pastas and risotto dishes. I opted for the pasta special - lasagna. The lasagna was very filling with chicken and beef in it.   From what I heard from my friends, they enjoyed their risotto and pasta dishes as well.   Our server was attentive and very friendly.   We also had our own cake for a friends birthday and they didn't charge cake cutting fees so that was a plus !   This is an option if you want a quieter environment in Richmond hill :)"}
{"text":"Discovering a new Italian restaurant in the neighbourhood is like striking gold (or oil-whichever you prefer. Lol)! In the old Fire&Ice location, they have spruced it up, included modern-chic decor, and made it a welcomed space!  First of all, parking here is a breeze! With very few business around, the multitude of parking spots makes finding one quite easy!  Walking in, the first things you may notice are the beautiful wine rack and bar, and the open kitchen! Sitting down, the table was a bit wobbly, so we asked to move to a different one. This one was also wobbly, but manageable when placed right up against the wall. After a look around, beautiful decor and ambiance fills the restaurant, albeit some space could be used a little better. Tables in open areas seemed to be randomly placed in include more seating.   Food was quite good, as we did order an array of choices. The Antipasto Plate was fantastico, blending sweet and sour together without disrupting the balance between meats, cheese, and grilled vegetables. The Veal with Capers was quite good, though I had never had giant capers before. A bit overwhelming for the veal, but without, the veal was quite tasty. The accompanying pasta was cooked perfectly to al dente. The Risotto was quite good as well, with the seafood quite fresh overall. The Double Chocolate Cake was quite rich in chocolate flavour without being too sweet! The crust was quite hard though, which made eating quite a difficult task.   Overall a good meal, but the menu boasted more seafood options than I would have liked. Being allergic to crustaceans, my options were limited quite a bit to mostly fish or chicken. Definitely a good Italian choice in the Markham area! Buon appetito~!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 6 on Sunday night.  The place was not too busy and when we arrived, surprisingly we had to wait much longer to get seated, even though there was no one around.  Even after we sat down, it was a struggle flagging someone down to take our order. Usually and based on what I saw from other tables, they would bring bread out to nip on while waiting for food. I had to personally ask for this when my meal already came so that kind of defeated the purpose. Given that the restaurant was not half full, I would have expected better service. Most of us ended up getting pasta, but nothing made me \"woah\" at my food    Overall, I didn't have the most positive experience at the restaurant. One of us also had to reorder the food because it was too salty."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Novita, all 5 of us were very happy with our meals as well as our shared antipasto appetizer. All the food came nice and hot and quite a large portion (doggy bags were needed)  Service was good and prices weren't too bad considering portion size. We were all too full to even look at the dessert menu."}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time with a huge group for a special occasion and it was pretty good.  Reservation was honoured although it seemed surprisingly unnecessary for a Saturday night.  Restaurant is spacious offering a view of the chef's kitchen.  Complimentary bread baskets with olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette were a nice touch.  Menu had a colourful selection, perfect for my fickle and indecisive self...appetizers, salads, pastas, pizzas, steaks, seafood, etc.  Portions were incredibly generous, we were all very impressed.  Although we didn't go for the 3-course prix fixe menu, many at our table did and looks to be an awesome deal with still great portion sizes for under $30!  Worth a try!  The chef came out to our table as well so that was pretty neat!"}
{"text":"I'll have to go back to get a better gauge on the whole experience, as this restaurant has only been open a couple of weeks.   We came here for a work lunch and I'm thinking there are some kinks they need to work out. A couple meals didn't come on time, my meal had dairy in it even though I told them I'm allergic and one of the meals was just wrong (breaded instead of grilled chicken sandwich). They were nice enough to comp us some coffee and dessert.   That being said, the food was absolutely delicious. Everyone who didn't have a panini cleaned their plates. The panini people (myself included) had to take one half home. They were huge. One coworker had the fried calimari, which were cooked perfectly. Another coworker had the chicken parmiagiana which she said was absolutely delicious, and this is a woman who knows her chicken parm. Apparently the tiramisu was fantastic.  I'm really hoping they work everything out, because the food is great and they would make a great addition to this side of the 404."}
{"text":"Always a delicious and reliable meal. Got the gnocchi with rose sauce. Must try in markham!!"}
{"text":"The Grilled Vegetable appetizer platter had an assortment of portobello, zucchini, red pepper, eggplant, artichoke, and asparagus, with a spread of goat cheese.  It was really nicely assembled and looked like colourful artwork.  I really enjoyed this appetizer since it was refreshing, healthy, and tasty.  I especially liked the goat cheese with the zucchini, red pepper, and artichoke.  The Fusilli Alla Salsiccia pasta dish contained spicy Italian sausage, red pepper, and onion in tomato sauce.  This dish went so well with the parmesan cheese scattered all over it and there was no shortage to the cheese for a better flavour.  I liked the fusilli in this dish.  The spicy Italian sausage was indeed slightly spicy and quite good but I found it to be a little too spicy for my throat which was still healing up from the week before.  All in all, it was a great first visit to Novita Italian Cuisine and I could see why so many people were dining here for their good food and atmosphere.  From overhearing the server speak to another table, they have only been in business for about a year and a half.  (This restaurant used to be called Fire & Ice Grill.)  I wouldn't mind returning here for more Italian food!"}
{"text":"This is my overdue review for our visit here last year.  We visited shortly after its new opening.  The service was impeccable from their greeters to our waitress and the assistants.    We ordered the fried calamari as starter and it wasn't anything special, at all.  The complimentary bread and olive oil was of your standard.    I had the preferiti novita which was the shrimp, scallop and salmon penne in Asiago cream sauce.  The salmon was fresh, so was the scallops and the shrimps!  The penne was cooked al dente ( a MUST for me when it comes to pasta), though the Asiago cream sauce did get bit rich after short while through the meal.   My husband had the pollo marsala which was the chicken with mushrooms and paired with some veggies.  He enjoyed it thoroughly and said he would order it again.    Though I would truly give this restaurant a 3.5 stars but the reason it didn't get to a 4 stars was because I ordered a baked halibut with mango salsa and had it with pasta in tomato sauce and it was very disappointing to say the least especially being $26.95.  The sauce was very bad and tasted like your grocery store bought Ragu sauce.  The fish was alright and the mango salsa was so bland making the fish lacking in flavour."}
{"text":"I came based on Cherrie's recommendation and I was not disappointed! Walked in and was greeted immediately by (I presume) the owner. She was outgoing and friendly, definitely a good start to my dinner. She seated us at a table that had uneven legs, so it rocked as I applied pressure on the table. So I asked to be seated somewhere else and she accommodated with no hesitation. This is the kind of service I expect when I go out to eat - food as good as the service.  Fiancé and I ordered the fried calamari. I thought it was going to be small, so I stuffed my face with bread. Much to my delight, the dish was huge! So there I was stuffing my face again, except this time my face was full of calamari. The calamari was very crispy and tender to the bite. Did I mention oily since it was fried? Well, do expect that if you decide on getting it fried. This dish came with a spicy aioli sauce, which made eat bite hot and tangy. There's a choice between fried or grilled and I obviously chose the unhealthy one!  The main I got was the Pollo Al Marsala. It's a two piece chicken breast, topped with mushrooms and Marsala wine sauce. Also came with 3 small purple potatoes and veggies. The chicken was grilled and had a lot of flavour because of the sauce. But it failed to be tender and juicy because it was slightly overcooked. The chicken itself was fresh, just seared a little too long. The kicker for my meal was the sauce - not salty, had all the flavours of gravy and wine put together. I was definitely in sauce heaven during that moment. When you mix the chicken, potatoes and the sauce together, it creates an explosion of taste that you won't forget.  My fiancé ordered the shrimp, scallop, pesto and spinach risotto. I only had a few bites, but I could see how much she enjoyed her meal because usually she has leftovers. But there was nothing left for me last night, so it had to be THAT good. The few bites I took were all very creamy, with a blast of seafood flavour.  Visiting the washroom was also very pleasant. The men's restroom was very nicely designed with very tasteful colours chosen. Everything was tiles and had granite counter top with matching/complimenting colours. I wouldn't mind using the restrooms a few more times!  It's unfortunate, though, that I have to remove a star because of slow service. If I could, I would give it 4.5 instead of 4. It wasn't busy because of Canada Day, so there was no reason for service to move like a sloth.  On a side note, the bar looked super fancy! I will make sure I sit there next time"}
{"text":"If I could do half a star I'd add half a star.  I've read some of the other reviews and I agree. It's not terrible it's not the most incredible.  It has room for improvement that could make it that much more memorable.  They have a 3 course prefix menu that is very reasonable. $24.95 choice of soup day, quinoa fried balls stuffed with cheese on spicy marinara, or grilled calamari stuffed with tomatoes and olives for appetizer. Main course you have a choice of pappardelle bolognase, 2 others I can't remember [(I ordered the pasta ;) ] and raspberry or lemon sorbet for dessert. With the prefix you get 15% off any bottle of wine.  The portions are quite generous. I went with my husband and niece we all ordered the same main but ordered one of each appetizer to share. We ended up with one pasta dish completely untouched.  The bolognase sauce could be done a lot better.  Traditionally bolognase is more of a ragu with the meat minced and placed atop the pasta. The sauce here is more of a meatball sauce. The pasta was not completely al dente, but the texture was nice.  The appetizers were really good, only the quinoa balls stuffed with mozzarella left it quite bland if there wasn't enough sauce on it. A little more seasoning or a different stuffing would elevate this dish very very much.  The soup of the day was a potato and leek soup. The bowl was huge! As a cream soup it was quite filling.  The calamari that was paired with tomatoes, olives and rapini was just delicious.  Service is friendly, however there isn't a lot of servers. The owner/chef would come out and ask how your experience is/was.   For the price and the quality of food for that price I'd go back."}
{"text":"I have been here twice with WorldVentures members and I have to say the food is very good. The price is very reasonable and the service is also very friendly. The location is convenience and parking has no issue. It is better then some of those expensive Italian restaurant in Markham. I will come again!"}
{"text":"First time going to this restaurant. There was a lot of options on the menu which I always find as a bonus.  Our waiter was pleasant and accommodating.  The food was great as it left us wanting more. The one thing I was pleasantly surprised was,  how the chef came to the table during our meal just to see how we were doing. This is something you don't experience often but left a memorable impression for us both."}
{"text":"Meh. Mediocre. I've had better. It's okay.  All words I'd use to describe this semi-new Italian cuisine in Markham. Honestly, I don't have a lot of hope for restaurants in this area- No offence if you like eating around here, but come and let me show you the world ;)   Came here for lunch on a Thursday afternoon and was pleased to see how beautiful and spacious it was. Definitely does not look that way on the outside, but the inside was classy and clean as ever. We got seated right away but our server that was 'supposed to be with us shortly' didn't show until 5-7 min later with a short apology on how she didn't know it was her table.... Um, but you're the only one serving the three occupied tables in the area? Okay. After that, she was very nice and friendly so it didn't matter to me.   The bread appetizer that came was.. Meh. Cold and hard bread with olive oil and vinegar? Not my cup of tea and it certainly wasn't anything special. Boyfriend and I both ordered pasta (linguini Alfredo and Italian sausage/pepper/onion- they both had fancy names but my asian ass ain't about that & can't remember) Both dishes were yummy and super filling. My Italian sausage pasta dish was FILLED with sausage. Usually restaurants skimp out on he meat but novita sure didn't! I had so much I was flinging them into my boyfriend's linguini dish as much as possible. I was so full after half the dish, I don't know if it was worth it or not. The pasta dishes, although yummy, were nothing spectacular and nothing I'd remember to try again.   The service (other than the first incident) was awesome and courteous. Other than that, I wouldn't be killing to come back. Maybe if it was a friend's choice."}
{"text":"Novita went all out for Christmas decorations! The white feathers and sparkles were really cute! I also like the ambiance here - modern and upscale but not so much where you feel obliged to dress to the nines.   Staff were friendly and restaurant was very clean. Bathrooms especially, which is a rarity nowadays.   For dinner, I had the mixed fresh vegetables and portobello mushroom risotto. Overall, very tasty! While the risotto was really good, I wouldn't price it at almost $16...maybe $13 at most. There just wasn't much about it that made it stand out from other similar risotto dishes.   Novita is definitely a place where you want to go to if you're feeling for some Italian and you are in the area. I'm definitely down for coming back and trying out more pasta dishes."}
{"text":"I've been to Novita a few times already, and every visit so far, my guests are very pleased with the quality and quantity of the food and the services.  I have to really thank CT for recommending this place to me, because I would of never came here by myself due to the awkward location where Fire & Ice used to be on Highway 7.  If you come to Novita, make sure you try their risotto!  They are absolutely the best with very nice cream sauce and a lot of ingredients.  Their pasta here is amazing as well, they are always done al-dente with great flavour!  For appetizers, I always go with the Mussels and Grilled Calamari, both are large portion and taste great!  A nicely decorated restaurant with great pasta at a reasonable place is the best combination for a night with friends or your date."}
{"text":"Fabulous new Italian restaurant in Markham!   Six of us came for lunch and really enjoyed this dining experience.   Beautiful modern decor and ambiance.    Food was delicious, fresh and nicely presented.  Lots of menu options from salads, gourmet pizzas and panini sandwiches to pastas.  Most of us went with the salmon or the special - a mahi mahi with mango topping with our choice of grilled vegetables or pasta.  The goat cheese salad and the fried calamari with aioli sauce were also terrific.   There was some yummy dessert choices - enjoyed the carrot cake and panna cotta.  Nice cocktail and drink menu as well - tasty Sangria!  Service was warm, friendly and accommodating.   The owner chef and the manager both took the time to introduce themselves and ensure we were happy with the food. Prices were reasonable and portions were generous.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty solid. Would give it a 3.5 rating. Dishes taste well, fair prices for the portions they give (pretty generous) and ingredients are pretty fresh. Has a wide selection of food to choose from. I honestly couldn't decide. Atmosphere is big and nice. Some horrible disturbing trance music was playing in the background while we were eating but then it changed to classical afterwards. Waiter may not come to your table occasionally if you sit farther back from the kitchen. Would probably be back to try other dishes as it's one of the few better Italian restaurants in Richmondhill that I've eaten so far."}
{"text":"Located in a non descript plaza with big stores, you might not know it's there.  The space itself is quite large and spacious, not a whole lot to worry about with in trying to get a table it seems.  But despite not being packed, there are a lot of positives to write about. First, is good you have the space. Who wants to sit so close to your neighbor that you can eat their food? No one.  The food itself. The grilled calamari was accompanied by some salad with warm olives. They tasted pretty good I must say.  Also tried two pastas, the penne with smoked salmon and rose sauce had a nice flavor though I felt the salmon needed be chunkier to really see it and it really could be saucier.  The angel hair pasta with chicken and olive oil was alright but I don't really like angel hair.  The service itself was nice, they weren't always around but when they were they were courteous."}
{"text":"We've been to Novita about 5 times, and it's consistently good. Tonight, I had the lobster pasta, with huge chunks of lobster and shrimp. My wife had the chicken parm, and my parents each had the trout that was part of a 3 course special, which was a great deal for $28. All 3 said their meals were very good. The space is really lovely; lots of light and nice decor. This is a really good spot for families. Can't understand why this place isn't packed every night."}
{"text":"Reserved a table and was seated awkwardly with one of the table ends blocked by an add-on chair for a customer of the table next to us. Inconvenient as we were going to have a friend's baby be seated there instead of by the restaurant's emergency exit at the other end of our table, which was cold with a draft coming in. Not very thoughtful of the restaurant.  I had the linguine del formaggio di capra and it was delicious. Generous portion though was slightly dry. Also had calamari shared with friends, which was very enjoyable.  Overall, everyone enjoyed their meals and left full and satisfied. Worth a try and probably best to make a reservation to avoid lineups on a weekend."}
{"text":"Been here a few times over the course since it's been opened,  and every time it doesn't disappoint in terms of food and service...   Been back tonight with some friends and I was still happy with the food and pricing. Pasta was cooked Al Dente, salad was quite big in size, couldn't finish,  my friend ordered fish of the day and it was cooked well but needed a tad bit more seasoning..   We were seated upon arrival on a Friday evening, in a booth, and given complimentary bread, the bread was quite soft. I would recommend to eat any pasta dish here as it wouldn't disappoint in portion and in taste.  The salad went just ok for me as I didn't like goat cheese, they gave me asiago cheese instead which probably didn't work as well with my salad. They didn't have blue cheese oh well...  Wine list was short and no BYOB for a fee is probably what knocked off that 1 star...  A place worth the money and I will be back..."}
{"text":"The food here is remarkably great! Their pasta dishes are delicious! Their pizza was also very good. Great ambience... a bit dim which is great for dates and intimate gatherings. The prices were reasonable. Lots of free parking in the plaza. Friendly, attentive staff.   After eating here, go take a look at the Mobilia furniture store next door and look at Italian sofas to finish the Italian experience."}
{"text":"Valentine day disaster , table of 8 1- service extremely slow, waitresses where doing their best but clearly understaffed and not ready to handle the number of diners  2- Salad came without dressing  3- my main order was lost, everyone else on the table got their order before me 4- trying to make it right they got me lamb instead of veal (my original order) 5- for dessert my wife ordered a soufflé. The waitress said it may take a while, as it takes 3-4 minutes in microwave which brings me to point 1: who the heck uses a microwave in a restaurant? Soufflé should be made in an oven 6- just before the soufflé arrived we could clearly smell a burning smell, we thought there was a fire, then it turns out it's our soufflé, the waitress just put the burning soufflé on the table and left.  7- after we called her back and complained, the chef came and apologized however the damage was already more than done. When other patrons saw me they were also telling me their soufflé is burnt too and were clearly unhappy ! 8- to be fair the restaurant tried to make it right and the chef apologized but I couldn't care less, the experience was ruined.. 9- ordered a bunch of alcoholic drinks which they didn't have.  10- my daughter got a pasta and didn't eat it, we packed that to go, a day later while trying to re-heat the pasta I found a rubber band in there !!! Wtf..   Think twice before you eat there..."}
{"text":"The risotto and pasta are all done very well and the portions were generous. The seafood consisted of scallops, shrimp, and clam. Could use some more veggies though, or I'd order a small salad next time.  Tiramisu was the best dessert I've had in a while, very light and a good finish.  Angel hair pasta was a bit strange, probably won't order that again."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and waiter friendly and attentive. The price fixe offers excellent value. I loved the stuffed chicken Pollo Milano, with great rose sauce. The spicy sausage Bolognese spaghetti looked great wand was substantial. The creme caramel dessert was one of the best, tasty and creamy in texture. Modern, casual ambiance, not too noisy."}
{"text":"\"Great spot for a work lunch or dinner after the meeting.\"  It's tucked away some what being accessible just east of the 404 on high way 7. It's just west of Woodbine. The exterior looks a little dated but don't let that fool you.   Atmosphere  The inside looks very modern with contemporary Italian cuisine. Dining area is large but also cozy at the same time. Kitchen is in view near the front.  Food  A lot of classic and contemporary Italian dishes and a few with modern twists.  We ordered the seafood linguini, hallibut with mango avocado sauce and the stuffed chicken breast.  All were excellent. I recommend however to get the sauce of the halibut on the side as to appreciate the fish without being overpowered by the sauce. Chicken was very flavourful with a good mix of mushrooms and spinach. The seafood linguini was loaded with seafood and from all accounts was delicious.  Price:  Reasonable. Expect to pay between $15 - $25 for a main dish unless it's a prime cut of steak. Reasonable for sure.   Would come back for a mid week date or client lunch anytime"}
{"text":"The positive reviews here paint a very misleading picture compared to our experience on Saturday night. When we arrived for our reservation for a table of 12, we were promptly seated (This was the best service we received all night... it ended there, sadly).   Both the hostess and waitress neglected to serve us any bread/rolls even after the entire party had been seated. Before the waitress took our orders, we asked what the soup and fish of the day was. She looked at us blankly and told us she'd find out. When she came to take our orders, she asked us if we were splitting bills so she could note our seating arrangement and bring our food accordingly. Still no bread at this point. We looked around and it seemed nobody else in the restaurant did either. Maybe this Italian establishment does not serve complimentary bread.   Service is seriously slow. I finally waved over the hostess standing idly by who said she forgot and came back with one plate of cold bread (8 pieces for 12 people). Apparently they ran out of bread and would bring more as soon as the kitchen prepared it. Keep in mind it was only 8 pm at this point. Another plate was brought out in 15 minutes, also cold.    When our appetizers arrived, our waitress had magically forgotten what each person ordered and decided to pass them down the head of the table and make us figure it out amongst ourselves. A few of us ordered the shrimp diavolo. I had 4 shrimps in my plate and my friend had 8. Is consistency/counting/bread a thing around here? The cauliflower ball was good. Apps: 7/10.  When the mains came, the waitress once again asked what each of us ordered. (Why did she bother numbering us anyway?) The mains were underwhelming. Presentation was nice but didn't make up for the subpar food. My seafood linguine was undercooked and underseasoned. I ate all the seafood and left the pasta. My friend's lobster was so salty he had to return it. The only acceptable mains were the salad and steak. When we told the waitress the lobster was too salty, she looked displeased. She didn't bother asking if we were done with our food and took away our plates. My friend was still eating his pasta when she asked if he wanted it packed. The restaurant was half full but it felt like she wanted us to leave right away. Mains: 3/10.    Desserts were alright: 7/10. Once again, the waitress asked us what we ordered (3rd time's the charm?). Desserts were distributed in no particular order, in front of whichever guest she felt deserved food. One of the tiramisu looked like someone dropped it and tried to reconstruct it back on the plate. She explained fresh tiramisu looked like this (as if we didn't know what tiramisu was) even though the rest of the tiramisu looked fine. How did they even let this out of the kitchen? We had taken maybe one bite when the waitress told us she was bringing us the bill. My friend told her he wasn't happy with the service and wanted her to remove the automatic 18% gratuity. I'm not kidding when she said \"I could see this coming, hun. The gratuity is on the bill by law.\"   We were pretty fed up at this point and asked for a manager, which they (surprise, surprise) don't have. Instead, the owner (also head chef) came to speak with us and offered us 10% off our next meal. I don't think any of us are returning so, thank you, but no thank you."}
{"text":"Thin crust pizza was amazing.  I asked for hot olive oil to go with my pizza and a nice contemporary looking glass jar of hot olive oil was brought out Friendly staff.  Clean restaurant and modern .  Draught Moretti beer available."}
{"text":"We came here to have lunch. We ordered risotto, pizza and fried calamari. The food was ok, but definitely not the best Italian cuisine I had. I found the service was not bad though. Not sure will come back or not."}
{"text":"The place is great for parties! It has a wonderful atmosphere and awesome service. The food is delicious and the portion sizes are wonderful. Definitely recommend it for a a group night outs."}
{"text":"I always drive through this area, but don't hv a chance to try it until tonight.  We order grill calamari for app, and I m surprise it comes with lots of salad.  The main, we had lobster spaghetti and seafood risotto.  When those brought up to the table, they are huge in portion!  Huge and also taste good.  The price is also reasonable.  I would recommend to give a try, and personally will go back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my classmates, we order chicken alfredo pasta while one of my friend order a pizza. I love the crispness of their pizza dough. The pasta was pretty good, not too salty and very creamy."}
{"text":"It is 4 stars from me.  My BF rated Novita 5 stars, and I would explain his reasons later.  Novita is interesting, in that the star rating changes depending on if you like ambiance a lot more than food or not, and vice verse.    The ambiance at Novita is really nice.  It is like a fresh air from, eh Vaughan.  Light coloured theme says contemporary, modern classy.  The seating speaks casual.  We went during daytime, so the decor spoke casual fine dining to me.  I sat there and wondered how the place would look like in the evening.  We ordered 1 appetizer and 2 entrees, admittedly the more expensive ones on menu.  My first impression of the food quality was middle of the road.  The Fried Calamari ($11) and the Shrimps, Scallops, Pesto & Spinach Risotto ($20) were both average.  Then I taste tested my BF's Linguine Al Pesce ($19).  It tasted quite a bit better.  The red sauce was delicious.  And this was when it hit me: Novita is a bistro.  It makes good pasta (I haven't tried pizza yet).  The tiramisu dessert was made in house.  It was very moist and soft; flavour was rich yet texture was light.  All of the orders were well portioned.  We doggy bagged part of the entrees home.  I believe the split style in decoration and food contributes to the varied ratings.  If you like ambiance a lot, Novita is an auto 4-starred restaurant.  If you like food a lot more than ambiance, and you happen to have ordered something other than pasta (and maybe pizza), your experience will likely be 3-starish.  If you like ambiance, (really) like a reasonably priced date restaurant, like red sauce pasta, like generous portion, meaning my BF type of diner, Novita is a 5-starred restaurant.    In my case, I position Novita as a bistro with a casual fine dining decoration (I suspect this may be what the owners aim to be).  I will give 3 stars for the food this time, an extra star for ambiance and attentive services.  When I return, I will probably stick with pasta and maybe pizza, so I may keep thinking the food is 3.5/4 starred as well."}
{"text":"Have wanted to try his place ever since it opened. Food was okay, nothing special. To be honest not sure what all the talk about their bread is about. The bread we received was just regular french baguette , room temperature. I had ordered the veal rottini, however, I found it to be slightly over seasoned and the veal was slightly tougher than I would have liked. We had also ordered the salmon with pasta as the side. The salmon and pasta were delicious but the presentation needs improvement. For this dish the presentation looked more like a home cooked meal than restaurant quality food.   As for the environment, it was pretty loud, they had someone singing live, in the back I think, but never saw, were seated near the entrance. They also have an open kitchen design.   We had reserved a table online, however, when we told the host about the reservation he seemed lost, and had to find a table suitable for us. Our server was great.  Will return. I would like to try their three course dinner menu for $30 next time."}
{"text":"Came here based on all the good reviews and the close proximity to home. It was a Thursday night and the restaurant was near empty at around 6:30pm. Throughout the night I would say there were probably only around 5 tables served. Thats not a good sign for the business but it doesn't mean the restaurant is bad.   I would say there are some hits and misses for this restaurant.  The meals starts off with some complementary bread. It was a small portion of bread chopped into little rectangles with some kind of oil based dip. Sorry I'm clueless on what the dip was. I rather get a whole bread with butter instead but thats just me.  We decided to skip appetizers and just go straight to the main course. Not because we didn't want appetizers but we found the appetizer menu lacking in good options.   Sofia pizza $15.95 - I'm not a big fan of olives but this was the one we went with because it had goat cheese. There was a decent amount of goat cheese but the cheese lacked in flavour. The crust of the pizza was not crispy at all, not even the crust had any crunch to it. Overall, this main was a fail for me and I cannot recommend.  Shrimp scallop risotto $19.95 - creamy, tasty and with a good portion of seafood. This is probably only the third time I have had risotto in my entire life but I can easily say this was the best I have had so far. There were 5 medium sized shrimps and 2 massive scallops. Yes, I counted and I do it for all you reading out there. Someones gotta do the dirty work :) To compare the scallop in volume size I would compare it to a golf ball. At first I thought there was only one scallop in the dish so I savored it and took little bites every few minutes but when I found the second one it made me so happy. Nom Nom Nom - the second one was not savored at all. A really excellent dish.  For dessert they do not bring out a menu but instead they bring out a dish which has demo model cakes for you to examine. We went with the brownie chocolate cheese cake and tiramisu. We were only charged $6.99 for the cheese cake so I guess they forgot to charge us for the tiramisu. We realized this only after we left the restaurant. I swear :)  Both cakes were pretty good but nothing that blew me away or haven't had before.  Service was good. Hope this restaurant gets more customers because they make a mean risotto. I recommend giving this restaurant a try. A great place to bring your date, family or just chill and have a good meal with friends."}
{"text":"Decent service but food was sub-par. Everything was fairly bland, particularly for an Italian restaurant!"}
{"text":"The Good: Food tasted great.  The Bad:  Service: We had a big group of 12 with 4 kids ranging from few months old to 3 years old. As we are waiting for everyone to arrive, I asked if we could have some bread to start. I was super hungry and I wanted to keep the little ones happy with something occupied. The server said we normally don't serve bread until you place your orders because we want you to order apps and not fill up on bread.  Fine,we went ahead and ordered 4-5 apps before everyone arrived. To be honest, when you see kids around the table, you probably want to keep them occupied with something. We would have to bring our own food if restaurants like to be focused on these policies. You are assuming customer won't order apps and fill up on bread.   We each ordered a main course as well.   When we were having our apps, we were rushed to finish them as the mains were about to be ready. Great, we quickly finished them and waited for 15 minutes plus. What was the point of rushing your customers to finish when the mains weren't even ready. The gap quickly made us feel full from eating the apps. The food arrives and they were great but since we waited for so long, most of the us couldn't finish the main course.   Mind you, there was a mandatory tip on your bill so there was no discretion whether the service was good to deserve a better tip or not.  Environment: the décor was nice but there was this stupid spot light that keeps flashing. When you look at your menu, you keep seeing the lighting buzzing. That was very annoying throughout the dinner.  Kids Menu: the kids menu was a joke. ~$13 for a pizza and ice cream and a pop. We just ordered from the regular menu for the kids to share.  We end up paying $60 per person. I probably won't be back and I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. I just felt that their service was below average."}
{"text":"Shrimp and  garlic risotto is always great.  Grilled calamari is also good.  The Paola pizza with mascarpone is very special!!!!!  Duck breastfeed I say crusted onto the outside and tender inside.  Service was  excellent.  Slave and  decor also very pleasant."}
{"text":"I first tried Novita a year ago as it was recommended by my friend. I really enjoyed it at the time. But unfortunately this time was slightly disappointing. I was there on a Saturday night which I understand can be a busy time for any restaurant but we were sitting there for 20min before anyone even acknowledged us. The place wasn't even full. It took another 30min before food started coming. Food quality and portion sizes were okay. You can tell food was obviously rushed out though. Some of our orders were also mixed up/missed (one dish was supposed to have shrimp but had none when the dish came). They did fix all their errors which I appreciate.  Overall, everything seemed very disorganized. Every time I see a manager (wearing a dress shirt?) wander by, they seem confused.  It's such a shame because I love the location, the decor (very spacious) and large parking lot. It's a really nice place for gatherings.  I'm not sure if there was a change in management since I last came but they really need to work on better managing the place."}
{"text":"Overall the service is pretty good.. restaurant has a full menu and full bar.   I personally would recommend coming to this restaurant but if someone wanted to go, I would - that's my definition of 3 stars.  The food really was disappointing. We had a table of 11 adults. The only dishes which stood out as amazing were the Mushroom risotto and fried calamari.  Duck and Steak was cooked medium as requested but was dry. Seafood risotto had no risotto flavour, was overpowered by the red sauce.  Veal shank was salty and didn't taste much like tender veal... was probably over-cooked so the meat was dry.. and then over powered by the red sauce.  I would say the one marrow in the veal shank was the highlight.  The cannoli desert was hard as a rock and the bread on the table was cold.  Food bill wasn't expensive, $45pp, alcohol was $380 for 4 ppl."}
{"text":"Decided to go there last night and we really enjoyed it. When we arrived it was quiet and we easily got a table (waitress told us we came before it got busy and she was right, when we left the place was almost full. I had the agnolotti (pasta stuffed with spinach and ricotta) and my wife had the linguine with seafood. They gave us complimentary bread and oil (the bread with the mushrooms inside was delicious. We did not wait long for our food to arrive. My agnolotti was delicious especially the tomato sauce. My wife enjoyed her dish and could tell everything was fresh. We shared a tiramisu for desert which we both enjoyed. The price was reasonable and went with the quality of the food. The only negative thing is the music was a little bit loud (the speaker was above our table). Will go back."}
{"text":"Came here with two of my friends the other day. We all shared a Caprese salad which I thought was plated aesthetically and tasted good! I got the blacked chicken risotto which was alright not amazing, I had a taste of my friend's shrimp risotto was was A LOT better - if I come again I will definitely get that. My other friend got the Salute pizza which he thought was okay. Overall experience was pleasant, our server did seem distressed/worried at the idea of us wanting to split the bill which she asked us at the beginning of the meal. I remind you that there was only 3 of us. One of my friends and I shared a Tiramisu for dessert, it was good but I have definitely had better ones!"}
{"text":"I will definitely come back here!  Service was great and so was the atmosphere. I had the bruschetta and it was well worth it! Really delicious! I ended up getting the Haddock out of curiosity and I'll pass on it next time. I thought it was a great flavor combination but it didn't really mix well when I had it. The quality was there but the dish concept just didn't work.  Everything everyone else had was great and I'm looking forward to going here again."}
{"text":"Novita is a fairly new restaurant Markham that serves Italian food. We came as a group of 9 and it was a decent experience.  Food wise, they were pretty good. The portions are generous and delicious. Service wise, there is room for improvement.  The grilled calamari appetizer was nicely cooked and filled with flavor. It was not overcooked and chewy. It was also accompanied with a small little bed of salad which was dressed with a light vinaigrette.  For my main, I had the Paola pizza which was an olive oil based pizza with chicken, sun dried tomatoes, Mars Capone cheese and arugula. This was really good and I loved it. Highly recommended  The only thing that this restaurant needs to work on is their service. The staff is friendly but the time it took for the food to come out was pretty slow. It probably took 20 minutes between each course. To be fair, the owner here mentioned he had several people off which was a reason why they were slower. He also came out repetitively to apologize and we saw him scrambling with his staff to get food out to other tables in the restaurant. This is where the restaurant really suffered.  I'd definitely come back and give this place another chance. The food was good; hopefully the staffing/service improves the next time around!"}
{"text":"We went here for a work dinner. It is probably a 3.5. The restaurant is modern and nice but has a fast and casual feel.   We started with the bruschetta. Bread was good. Tomatoes were nice. It was tasty.   I had the halibut with mango and avocado. It was delicious. Fish was perfect and the sauce was very tasty. I had it with a side salad. The meal was pretty tasty.   Service was ok. There is a parking lot."}
{"text":"This place is solid. First impression was superb! So glad we made that spontaneous u-turn to go to Novita for Italian food tonight!  My friend and I were on our way to Alice Fazooli's and we noticed this new restaurant what used to be Fire & Ice. Odd location but I think it is a great idea that they set themselves away from all the big chain competitions on Hwy 7 and East Beaver Creek! Did a quick check on Yelp - 4 stars with 5 reviews - Awesome, let's check it out :D  You can still smell the fresh furnished wood right when you walk in... that's how new this place is lol. The atmosphere is bright, clean and welcoming! I love their open kitchen concept. There are plenty of space, I'm sure it will be great for large groups!  We shared the following:  Portobello mushrooms - This dish was really appetizing! The orange peppers were sweet, sauce was not overwhelming, and chef gave us a generous amount of goat cheese that paired so well with the mushrooms (you're the best!). I'd order this again!  Risotto with scallop, shrimp, pesto, spinach - It was SO creamy and good. The rice was cooked perfectly. Also, very generous amount of seafood, and they tasted really fresh! I love a good risotto... I anticipate to try the lobster risotto next time!  I'm very happy that such a fine Italian restaurant opened in Markham :D Food is hot and fresh, portions are big, service is attentive, and price is very reasonble :D The only con I had tonight was the bread, it was a bit too soft and plain for my liking. I like the rustic (chewy) or aromatic types of bread... ex. Olive bread! But that's just me :p  Happy hour is from 3-5pm Monday to Friday... discounts on cocktails and appetizers!  I would highly recommend this place. Can't wait to plan my next event here! Keep up the good work :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for our Christmas dinner and really enjoyed the food. It wasn't as busy as we thought it'd be for a Saturday night but they are a very big and spacious restaurant. They had beautiful festive decorations too! If you're looking for an Italian meal, they offer the usual that you'd expect like risotto, pasta and pizza. We enjoyed the blackened chicken risotto the best. The portions are decent and the meal comes with complimentary bread at the beginning! The waitress was very attentive as well and always checked on us.   The only thing negative side is the reservation system they have online. We requested a table online and it said they will notify us to confirm but we never heard anything back from them so we just called in to double check. There phone was switched between 3 people and our reservation wasn't saved so they just made us another one over the phone."}
{"text":"Meh.  On my first night in Markham my colleague and I were looking for a restaurant near our hotel where we could grab a quick bite because we got into town late.  Novita was the only restaurant that was within walking distance of our hotel so we came here.  This is one of those restaurants that prioritizes quantity over quality.  I ordered a plate of sausage, mushroom pasta and the portion was huge but the dish itself was uninspiring.  It was just lacking in taste and there were too many onions in the sauce so that dominated the flavours.  Service was also pretty slow considering that the restaurant was nearly empty.  I will say though that the price is reasonable.    In all Novita did the trick in that it filled me up but it was just so so for me.  The prices weren't too bad but the food quality could have been better."}
{"text":"FOOD: 7/10. The portions are way too big with inflated prices. The food tastes good, but not good enough to warrant 4 or 5 stars. Perhaps I need to give them another try to see if I like their food the second time. I wonder if Italians from Woodbridge eat here or prefer more authentic Italian restaurants in Woodbridge. I don't know. Just a thought. My 7/10 rating is based on comparison with Grazie in Toronto located at 2373 Yonge St. The food at Grazie tastes better and the portions are adequate.  SERVICE: 10/10. Courteous, prompt and professional.  DECOR: 8/10. Feels modern, but lacking in distinct character. The decor feels inauthentic, but perhaps it's just my own subjective POV.  PRICES: 7/10. Our bill was $67 (after tax, without tips) for 3 people with 3 pastas and 1 pint of beer. IMHO, that's expensive, partly due to an overpriced beer @ $8.50 per pint."}
{"text":"Surprised at all the good reviews. Our experience was the opposite. Service was extremely slow, we had to ask the hostess for our bill and containers, when she seated someone in our section. Our waitress was nowhere to be found. On top of that, the heat was not working in the restaurant, they had a portable heater positioned in the middle of the restaurant. Had to eat with our winter jackets on.  The food also wasn't great. Pesto sauce didnt have a hint of pesto, and the seafood was all overcooked. Risotto was undercooked.   Not an authentic italian place. Although the first hint would have been that the GM was south asian, the 3 cooks are south asian, as are the bus boys."}
{"text":"Ordered the gnocchi with lemon sauce. it was good for the first 3-4 bites but after that it gets really REALLY boring. it would have probably been good as a side, but not as an entree. I probably should've stuck to what i initially wanted to try. the spaghetti and meat balls."}
{"text":"We went there a couple weeks ago and I'm struggling to remember what I had.  At least that means it wasn't terribly bad either.   My wife had seafood risotto and she said it was just okay. The portion was certainly generous, as she couldn't finish. It had a lot more seafood in it than I'd expect for the price. We shared a Fried Calamari which was also generously portioned. The dipping sauce was really good! I had the Pollo al Masala. The wine flavor in the sauce was a tad overwhelming but the roast potatoes and veggies were yum. Unfortunately the star of the dish, the chicken, was slightly overcooked and not as juicy as I'd like.   We will probably end up going back some time just to try a couple other items"}
{"text":"Novita Italian Cuisine is a welcome replacement for Fire & Ice which had been around for years.  The interior is nicely redecorated to be a lot welcoming and brighter. The booth seating though can be a little tight (Maybe I put on some weight over the winter?).   The menu has a lot of classic Italian dish. All look really promising and ended up we ordered the following to share:  Zuppa De Pesce ($9.95) Mixed seafood and fish in a tomato herb broth  Vitello Marsala ($21.95) Tender Veal with wild mushrooms, dry Marsala wine and natural jus Baby Spinach Salad ($10.95) Oven roasted tomato with goat cheese & tomato vinaigrette  Portion is huge and great for sharing with a group. Aside from that, I found it just lack in quality. It was a little painful to see how my veal was drowned in sauce. Most of the food did reminded me of \"American\" Italian food and that might be some people preference like my dinner mate.  The service was really attentive and it was a nice touch when the Chef came out of the kitchen and talked to us and making sure sure everything is OK.  I would definitely give Novita another try as they do have a Happy Hour on weekday."}
{"text":"Ordered through skip the dishes. Food was meh I could of probably thrown something together that tasted just as good if not better if I wasn't too lazy to cook. But it seemed the chef was just as lazy. Had the spaghetti and meatballs; sauce was bland meatballs where also bland and salty. Portion size is all of had going for It. My thing is that I'd much rather have a smaller tastier portion then so big plate of nothingness."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in a plaza by itself. So indeed, there are plenty of parking spots. The restaurant is huge and it's an open space area. Modern decor. The service was good.   I have been here before so I was disappointed at my second visit. Found out that I should have stuck with a pasta dish.   DO NOT order any of their fish dish. Not fresh at all and it tasted weird. It wasn't hot either, just the two mini baked potatoes.   Their butternut squash soup was hot and had a good consistency. And the dessert of blueberry pans cotta could be silkier. So, the main dish was the bummer part.   Verdict: I would only go back if I'm invited out for dinner. And yes, I would stick to a pasta dish like my first time there. It's good for a large party since they have plenty of room."}
{"text":"This is one of the worse Italian food in markham and richmond hill area. Their pasta are abit over cook. But their staffs are friendly. Anyway i wont go back again."}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's Day and the food was good but the service was bad.   Atmosphere 8/10 The atmosphere was nice, there was live entertainment which was a man playing the guitar and singing acoustic covers which was very nice. The restaurant looks very clean and modern.   Food 8/10 We got surf n turf, rack of lamb, notiva pollo and salmon. Everyone greatly enjoyed their dish. The steak was super tender, melt in your mouth. The lamb was delicious as well. The chicken was well cooked but not amazing. The sides were potatoes and veggies, some of the veggies seemed a little over cooked. The potatoes were nothing special either.  We also got the tiramisu, I do not recommend it, it was nothing special.   Service  4/10 Was very bad. The waiter were not very friendly, our main waiter never even told us his name. He gave off the vibe that he didn't want to be there and serve us. The other waiters were not very better, they spoke very little. When they took our plates they just came and took them and reached over us to grab other plates without saying anything. Also they were slow to refill our drinks and they barley came to our table to check on us. We had to call them over to ask for dessert, wafer and finally the bill.   Go for the food, do not have high expectations for the service. I think the waiters must be retrained in customer service and being friendly."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night with some girl friends. New place that has been totally transformed. The space is beautiful. The food portions are large, price is reasonable (I had the set menu). The food was very tasty. I would definitely come back again for business/family or girls night out. This location is a bit hidden behind trees, but in a very commercial area. I think if people knew more of this place it would be much busier.   One of the better places I've dinned at in Markham."}
