{"text":"I am kind of sad I am just now discovering Napoli, because wow! We ordered a pepperoni and cheese pizza, mozzarella sticks, BBQ wings and fries. Every single thing we ordered was delicious. I cannot give 5 stars however because some of the food took a really long time to come out, but the customer service was still fabulous. I will definitely dine again here."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Worst service ever. Seriously some of the best pizza I've ever had but every single person I've encountered has been extremely rude."}
{"text":"Coming from a family who owned our own mom n pop pizza shop, it's so hard for me not to compare pizza to what I'm used to. I understand a wait time of 30 minutes for pickup and 45 min to an hour for delivery. This is pretty accurate from experience. I only have 2 complaints about this place; the pizza sauce is absolutely too salty! It needs to have more of a sweet kick in my opinion, a good balance between the salt n sugar is needed. Second, I think they are over priced all around."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza, chicken fingers and chili cheese fries at 130pm. The food did not get there until 3. The chili cheese fries lirerally smelled and tasted like a cigarette ash tray. Like someone loured an ash tray in it. So gross. We normally ordert heir xl lizza for games but we will never order here again. So"}
{"text":"Delivery service and food quality has been steadily declining.  During our last order, they took almost two hours to deliver it and when it arrived, one of the entrees was missing.  A call to the store to get my $16.99 back was met with \"well, our delivery driver left with all of your food.\"  No refund.  I guess we paid for the driver's dinner.  Stay away."}
{"text":"Get the hotwings and garlic balls. If you like classic hotwings get mild sauce. The pizza is good as well. They have a pickup special a 16 inch pizza one topping for 8 bucks. But seriously, just get the wings and be happy."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!

Called to make an order for pick up with no complications and was told our food would be ready in 30 minutes.

Once we arrived, we were greeted immediately. Told them we were there for our pickup, paid, got our food, and left within 5 minutes. 

Ordered: 
-chicken wings with bbq sauce and hot sauce on the side accompanied with veggies and ranch
-large pizza half with sausage, pepperoni, tomatoes, and artichokes and the other half with just plain pepperoni

Pretty good. The wings were crisp and were actually good in size with ample amount of meat-not those baby wings the size of a pinky. The pizza was pretty huge and sliced into big pieces with reasonable amount of toppings. If you're into thinner pizza that can easily fold then this place is for you. My only complaints would be that the pizza was not hot and it was fairly soggy. Otherwise, the flavors were there and the artichoke bumped it up a notch.

I hesitated ordering from here based on reviews but I was pleasantly surprised. I may have just been fortunate to come in on a good day but I wasn't disappointed. Bonus points for them being open late! Until 5 am on Fri and til 3 am the other days."}
{"text":"Good pizza good wings and great ranch pick up special pizza is the best deal. Been ordering from here for a few years and I recommend going there."}
{"text":"The service and staff at the Henderson location were terrible today.  I was told my order would be 15-30 min; ended up over an hour.  I sat waiting for my order while customers came in ordered and left with their pizza.  When the staff finally took the time to see if my order was ready, they came to find it had been ready for  over 10 min.  No apologies or anything.  Thanks for the cold pizza and the cold shoulder.  Go to Metro Pizza and you'll be much happier."}
{"text":"Me and my friend stopped here after work. She had forgot about the place.  We really enjoyed the Bianca pizza and the fried calamari were good. Next time we will try another pizza."}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service! Everyone was wonderful to work with and their pizzas are huge! Delivery was on time and exactly what we ordered!"}
{"text":"Service is great & pizza is fresh and cooked with a nice, crispy crust. Enjoyed myself and the friendly staff. and the music lol"}
{"text":"Had a late night sitting around talking with friends and unfortunately at that time of the night this was the only place that delivered. At an hour and a half we called them only to have the guy on the phone rudely say the driver was 5 minutes out and hang up on us. 30 minutes later our absolutely STONE COLD food arrived and the driver was completely Unapologetic or had any desire to make any kind of amends on the food. Pizza was salty and uninspiring..... From what I have now read on other reviews this is a common thing with them. Next time I will heat up and eat an old shoe before I order from Napoli. Zero Stars"}
{"text":"Great food great service! Especially love the pizza. Service is very fast and people are courteous."}
{"text":"Well this is the last time ordering from this place, one of the workers  who's name was \"Cary\" very rudely over the phone said it would take over 2 hours to diliver our pizza after running our creddit card, I asked for a refund, the girl hung up on me, I called back and was guaranteed a pizza within the next couple of hours. Nearly 3 hours went by and there was no pizza dilivered. I called back they said they decided not to put in any order. I asked for a refund again and was told I won't get one until 2 weeks have passed. I won't recommend  ordering from here to anyone they have the worst customer survice  ever to be provided to the public. They just lost a customer"}
{"text":"being a considerate person I try not to judge restaurants while ordering out but when I receive 5 burnt black chicken tenders in my child's kids meal I can't keep quiet. I will never order from them again."}
{"text":"They where not bad when I started going but after like the 2nd time I always had a problem they couldn't get my order right and I would have to wait an hour and a half after they said 30 min I spoke with the manager and he said he would give me a discount on my next purchase but when I brought it up he denied it and said he pretty much didn't care if I ordered or not but he would not give me the discount"}
{"text":"Called for carryout, great carryout deal  for 16\" pizza. Customer service was straight forward pizza business. Great deals for fries, wings, and pizza from Napoli's"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and let me start off by saying how disappointed I am that I wasted over 40$ on crap I got a special that includes a large pizza and chicken wings and I added a salad with extra ranch. Let me start off by saying the pizza was so disgusting it had so much oil it seems like they poored extra olive oil on it or something no Buenos. The chicken wings didn't have any sauce on them I ordered mild they came plain I was passed I like flavor I Don'T want taste less chicken . The only thing I didn't hate was the salad but you can't go wrong with that its a salad and the ranch was ok. I guess over all I rather go to angelinas pizza at least there food is good . Not like here"}
{"text":"For 3 times in a row they have gotten my order wrong. Ive called and the owner wont admit hes wrong he wont correct the order he will only tell you \"sorry my friend I will discount it on next order\""}
{"text":"1st time I have eaten on the one on the east side of town terrible service.  Called in my order was told 45 min . No problem  1 hr and 45 min later waiting in a not so nice part of town got my food taste like s**t."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE their Garlic pizza!! I've been to this location about ten times, and I've never been disappointed. We've had the pepperoni, pepperoni and sausage pizzas as well, all super good. Caesar salad, eggplant parm, fried mushrooms, and zucchini. All good. Good customer as well. But, again I love the garlic pizza. The garlic chunks are super fresh!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here many times over the years the food is generally very good the problem is a lot of the times they run out of things when you order it but they don't tell you so they substitute without calling you and letting you know for instance I ordered a roast beef sandwich they substituted it with corned beef I called to complain they apologized but nevertheless I ended up with the wrong order to the managers credit they did refund me my money they have also done that in the past ,  I ordered pasta salad and they substituted it with macaroni and potato salad."}
{"text":"I have to say the first experience I had with this place was not good. Not good at all. But I decided to try it again. Well the delivery may have been long but the food was fantastic! After reading so many bad reviews I was worried. But I was wrong. My food was hot and yummy! I now will order from Napolis again. Those garlic cheese balls OMG perfect my Gyro perfect! And the cannoli, just Devine."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I ordered a ravioli and 2 large pizzas. I was charged for the dinner ravioli which is $16.99 when it was lunch which is $7.99. When I asked the man behind the counter how come I could not get the lunch special he said \" I don't know hold on\" he stood there for about 2 mins left and never came back out. I then asked another employee she said it's a bigger portion and comes with salad and garlic knots. Which the lunch comes with and a soda. When I opened it there was only 4 raviolis if this is the bigger portion the lunch must come with 1. Also 1 of the pizzas was cold when I first picked it up. I would have sent it back but I was scared they might spit in my food. DONT EVER EAT HERE TERRIBLE PEOPLE AND TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not Napoli's best night - called at 5:17 for a pizza & was told it would that an hour & 10 minutes - called back at 6:47 & was told it would be delivered in 5 minutes - it's now 7:00 & it just arrived! If you are busy give a realistic time for delivery so as your customer we can decide if it's worth the wait! The pizza was at least warm  but I asked to hold the green peppers & add extra mushroom -got extra black olives on the Large supreme! Not a good night for Napoli's! 

Delivery man was very nice & he got it here warm!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They have great pizzas for great prices. Their boneless wings have to be my favorite, they arent too breaded where theirs a little bit of chicken. The chicken is so soft and just my favorite! #onelove"}
{"text":"most disgusting pizza i have ever seen in my life!!!!! I ordered a vegetarian pizza and when I received it, it had fried vegetables on it which was not mentioned on the menu or I never would have ordered it. The quality was poor, very poor and the customer service was even worse . when I called to ask for my money back, they actually referred me to the delivery company which makes no sense because the delivery company did not make the pizza. Long story short, the delivery company gave me my refund because Napoli would not. Needless to say, I'll never order from them again. They are a disgusting and despicable excuse for ANY type of pizza establishment let alone one they consider authentic.  do not fall for their commercials or ads . I honestly don't know how they're in business because I really think it's the lowest quality pizza I've ever seen in my life besides the fact that they put fried vegetables  on their vegetarian pizza. Disgusting disgusting disgusting don't go to or order from  Napoli Pizza you'll be terribly disappointed and you'll have a very hard time getting your money back. As a side note , if I could give a negative rating, it would be a minus 1000 stars!!!!!"}
{"text":"16\" 1 topping for $7.99!   We got cheese only and it's the best pizza I've had in Las Vegas so far.  I think I may stop looking.  It will be tough to top it.   So gooood! Perfectly greasy and chewy!  I can't wait to puck up another one.  The homemade lemonade ain't bad either."}
{"text":"the medium pizza special is great. I get it almost twice a month. the pizza is great as well. the chicken strips are always overcooked and dry so stay away from those after many times trying them. their hours of operation are great as well. customer service lacks at times. i will go back for the pizza special"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would! Food was disgusting, I order the potato skins, which I assume was processed because the cheese would not melt! The bacon was undercooked and just overall terrible. I also ordered the Philly chicken which was even more disappointing! Fries were cold and the bread on the sandwich was hard after complaining and asking for a refund I was offered $5 and was told the food was perfectly fine! I'll never order from this place again ! Bad business and bad food!!"}
{"text":"We waited 55 minutes for a large pizza. After 55 minutes, the guy came out and said... what did you order again? Unreal... and on top of that, nothing offered as compensation. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"It's been next to impossible to find a true Chicago Style pizza out, but through a delivery menu, saw that they had one. Although hesitant, I got excited.
Well I shouldn't have bothered! The crust is a complete failure! The outside crust is basically the thick crust style, but underneath completely made my jaw drop! There is the thinnest, I mean paper thin crust, and at least a 5 inch diameter in the middle with absolutely no crust. This is the most pathetic pizza ever! The only reason I almost gave 2 stars is because they loaded it up with cheese, and I love cheese, but I will never order from here again!!! See pics!"}
{"text":"I loved the garlic balls ! And the Chilli cheese fries hands down besst in Vegas so far  I will be back to order again"}
{"text":"Great food here. Been a customer for three years now. But customer service needs a lot of work. The girls never smile and the men that are always upfront will ignore you until one of the girls comes and helps you. But the food is so good I'll put up with the service. I love their buffalo wings and pizza."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night the staff is attentive and friendly made you feel right at home. The portions are great for family dinners and parties. If you love wings they have the best in town. Also I Love the new renovations looks awesome happy to see a great company grow."}
{"text":"Pizza came with crust in the middle and cheese and toppings in the corner of the box."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed when ordering pizza from this place. The girl that rang up our order said it would be 20-25 minutes for our pizza and garlic knots to be done. We sat down to wait. After 45 minutes of waiting my husband went up to inquire about our food. They said the pizza was still in the oven. We were so irritated that we asked for a refund and then left. We never got to even try the pizza, but with customer service like that I'm sure the food isn't much better. I will never order pizza from here again."}
{"text":"Horrible guest service. Inconsiderate and not professional. Arrogant and incompetent staff. Do not recommend at all...Pizza was extremely greesy."}
{"text":"I wanted to order several pizzas (about a $150.00 order) for my Las Vegas based call center, but I couldn't complete my order.

The employee who was trying to take my order was rude. She asked me what my business name was and before I could finish, she asked me what my address was. It didn't seem like she was a good listener. 

I promised my 45 employees that they would be getting pizza the next day. I couldn't trust that my order would be completed. 

I told her no thanks and I'll order from Pizza Hut!

I've ordered Napoli's for my home before. They have good pizza, but poor customer service.

Update:

The next day I called a different Napoli's location. They had some similar customer service issues, but were much better. My office got pizza and they were happy.

Perhaps just the Nellis Blvd location is bad."}
{"text":"Excellent food with tons of options for home delivery.  My family and I just finished up our meal delivered from Napoli's in Henderson, NV.  We ordered the Calzone, Veal Parmigiana Sandwich, and the Linguine Imperiale entree.  I used the online order system so I could take my time selecting and it worked flawlessly.  Top of the order page listed 45 minutes for delivery, and the order was in fact delivered within the 45 minutes.  The food arrived well packaged, hot, and every item correctly prepared.  I ordered the 'small' Calzone, but it was huge - the size of a half a pizza box. The Veal Parmigiana sandwich was hot and moist with tons of melted cheese, although the fries were a bit soggy.  The Linguine Imperiale entree was a bit pricey at $19.99, but the portion was enough for two of us and it came with a small (very small) salad and garlic bread.  The Imperiale was wonderfully creamy with plenty of clams and about 6 shrimp, a very nice amount of pepper - very tasty.  The delivery charge was only $2.50, and the online system provides the ability to leave a tip in the amount of 10%, 15%, or 20%.  I like to leave the tip up front in every home delivery as a bit of an incentive.  As most people, we also love to buy their giant New York style pizza (30\") for special occasions, and we have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Big greasy delicious slices, it was one of the best pizzas I've ever had"}
{"text":"This place has absolutely the worst customer service. They wait till you pay before they can tell you about the wait time. Don't dare try to tell them that it's has been way over time. They will keep telling you \" couple more minutes \" every time you ask.  Me and some friends went there for dinner, we order to go. While we waited for the order, they didn't even offer us water or anything while waiting. We had a feeling it was going  to take a while since there were receipts everywhere in their counters. Super disorganized. We have people order before us and they had their food.  I understand being busy. But unprofessional is unacceptable. Do not recommend this place to anyone. Go else where. Plenty of places that will treat you like a customer. Unfortunately, this place won't. Hey"}
{"text":"I really don't know how all those people up there are saying this food is amazing. It's garbage. The pizza is good if you're drunk and hungry and nobody else is delivering. I've ordered from them at like 1 in the morning because I really wanted pizza and decided they were the only ones open. Be that as it may, the food is lackluster at best. For those of you that are in love with it, try Verrazano's on Windmill next time and tell me what you think. Napoli blows. Like I said, the only reason to order from here is because it's super late and nobody else is delivering. And yeah, even then you have to wait 45 minutes to over an hour so have fun with that. 

p.s.- you may also find on occasion that the bottom of your pizza is burned or a little black. Again, garbage. This has happened to me more than once."}
{"text":"Napoli's pizza man it's my favorite pizza play the pizza is so delicious it's also huge it's like the size of a table man don't try to eat one by your self it's to big for one person I like the environment and it's also really clean"}
{"text":"Small place in the corner of a shopper center...I'm giving it a 3 because the salad tasted like they just dumped vinegar on it...the pizza was pretty good..it was freezing cold inside and had to move twice to get away from the cold air blowing down from the ceiling"}
{"text":"I ate here way back then and truly will never go back....for one, the last time I went there I ordered a cheese pizza with bacon(no problem) as I was sitting there waiting and watching everyone else get their orders and being served I started to wonder...what the hell is going on?45 minutes and the pizza wasnt even ready yet???I told the guy at the counter and I said forget it...he returned my money and I just left that place...I really don't have the time for idiots or 3 hour waits for a friggin pizza that i can truly make way better homemade than they ever can.its true."}
{"text":"The best pizza and calzone I have ever had.  Dine in, order out or delivery.. its alway bust but wait times ate not ridiculous.   
So far I have not had anything bad.  The small calzone is huge portions are very very generous. We have Napolis on a pretty regular basis."}
{"text":"The food is awesome but I have had some issues with delivery. Great gluten free pizza too! The best I have had in a while."}
{"text":"This is great pizza pie.  Tasty crust, excellent sauce and lots of cheese.  They have an $8 large pizza special that rocks and two locations - henderson and west side.  be sure to pick the right phone number."}
{"text":"I think this place has very good pizza along with their garlic balls! Prices are reasonable, but the wait is FOREVER! Their menu is huge from cheeseburgers to desserts, and there's something for everyone! I wish customer service would get better such as more friendly and quicker!"}
{"text":"BEWARE!!! They stole $75 from me. Never was delivered food, promised refund would go through. Never received refund, these people are low life thieves....."}
{"text":"Best buffalo pizza I've ever had, the rest the fam were also very pleased with the Hawaiian pizza and the meat lovers,the garlic balls were also awesome. .. keep up the good pizza. .."}
{"text":"I ordered a 18\" calzone the other night,  it was awesome as usual but I woke up the next morning with food poisoning. It was terrible , I couldn't even move. They permanently lost my business."}
{"text":"Delicious everytime!!!
The sausage is the best!
Garlic balls are awesome too!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here, it was very busy and didn't seem like enough people were working. I waited for like 10 mins before someone took my order. I sat down to wait on the food. Once the pizza was brought out to me, I could see puddles of grease on top of the pizza. The crust was burnt and it looked nothing like a Chicago deep dish pizza. I tried to eat a slice, the whole bottom of the pizza was black and grease just gushed out of the crust. I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Ordered a steak salad and a lunch combo of wings, fries and a drink. Order arrived about twenty minutes earlier than they said to expect it. Everything was delicious, and the containers were PACKED with food. Used to eat their pizza when they were in green valley, and will definitely be ordering from them more often now that I live close to this location."}
{"text":"Three small pizzas. First order of the day. 2 hours for delivery. After the third time of the manager lying about where the delivery man was, we just opted for a refund. The level of unprofessionalism displayed for pizza considered mediocre at best, is unacceptable. Save your time, save your money, and save your appetite for somewhere else."}
{"text":"Not bad pizza, I would say above papa Johns or any of the chain pizza places. I tried the Alfredo and supreme pizza, I could taste all the ingredients  in both, and both had a good amount of cheese on them. All in all I wouldn't mind coming back for more. They also have out door seating and beer to go with the pizza."}
{"text":"Napoli Pizza location...(765 North Nellis Blvd. North Las Vegas, NV)...is the nastiest place to order food from. The food is under cooked and raw. When you speak to them about your order they tell you that the food was just fine and that your complaint will fall deaf ears and they will not do anything about. The manager...(Holl)...I think that is what they called him will tell you that he spoke to the owner and they will not do anything about it you either like or your out of luck.... this place is -10 stars. I wouldn't feed there food to animals. Notify the HEALTH DEPARTMENT FOR RAW FOOD WHEN ORDERED WELL DONE AND BBB ABOUT BUSINESS PRACTICES."}
{"text":"I walked in for the first time and was greeted immediately. Very friendly.  I got a spaghetti with meatballs which comes with garlic bread and a salad. The food was really good, liked the spicy sauce, however I only got two meatballs. That made me sad, because I love meat alot and my favorite number is four. So there you go. I am going again."}
{"text":"poor delivery service !! they forgot a 11.99 salad and dressing for a gyro sandwich and it took them 1 hour to return with it and we live close. seeing it was their mistake the only thing i got out of the managers mouth was well were busy with lots of deliveries...no come on it was your mistake. no apology- nothing."}
{"text":"Napali's pizza is wonderful & hand made dough. Excellent chef's salad with lots of meat and cheese. They have gr
eat daily specials. They are fantastic!! I would highly recommend them."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here over 20 times! The pizza here is amazing. Super cheesy which I love! I always just get the pepperoni pizza, they have a really good deal 16\" for 8.64. I've also tried the cheese bread. Super good! The pizza never takes long. 25 minutes at most. My boyfriend has tried the garlic Parmesan chicken wings which were also very good. I always recommend this pizza place to my friends! I have no complains about the costumer service. Never had a bad experience. I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Had a big problem with the Henderson location and the managers made it right ASAP.  I greatly appreciate that they took the time to fix the issue promptly."}
{"text":"While they may have good food, the service is lacking. My co-workers and I have ordered from this location on several occasions and the past few times it has been disappointing. The most recent disaster was a lunch order place at 1:05 pm that was not delivered until 3:02 pm on Valentine's day. Though i did receive a text message from them (through eat24) stating that the order would be late but should be delivered by 2:20 pm, I still had to call them at 2:40 asking where my food was. I was offered a 10-15 minute estimate and a generic, \"Sorry about that,\" but the food was not worth the wait. Had I known that the order would literally take 2 hours I would not have ordered, and will not again. I still had to pay, too, no discount or freebies, (not even a courtesy call regarding the extended wait time) for waiting to try to pacify some hungry people who had to wait an unreasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery though grub hub and it took over and hour and thirty minutes just to get to our door. That was the best part of our experience. The boxes were all cover in grease that got all over the place leaving a mess. The curly fries with cheese bacon probably would have been good but it was so cold that the melted cheese had solidify again. The garlic balls were also completely cold but once I microwaved them they were not bad, but I shouldn't have had to microwave them in the first place. The cold roast beef sandwich was absolutely horrible. I asked for no onions but got them anyway even after the girl on the phone confirmed the no onions. The tomatoes we mushy the lettuce was wilted and the cheese which they had melted was again solidified. And the meat was grayish and disgusting. Very disappointed to have spent $32 for very bad food. The only thing they got right was the 2 liter of Dr Pepper."}
{"text":"First and foremost the food was not all that at all. If I could take back this one star I would. I literally tried to remain calm because the first time the manager called me he was so rude and had such an attitude because he called and I didn't answer the phone. He was acting as if he had been calling for 30 mins, so I said oh I'm sorry I didn't see it and he said we stopped making the food so it will be there in 35 mins ... ok y'all now hold that thought this was at 11:40am. Then I got an attitude because I checked my call log to see when he called and he called twice 3 mins ago. I let that slide whatever you know. It is now after 1 pm and the food is cold fries are nasty and my order was wrong ! I call him back (the manager) and he snaps telling me why are trying to do this around xmas? , your just trying to start something and find something wrong, the order isn't wrong at all... mind you I placed my order online with very specific details that he repeated back to me after our first conversation lol . He said let me talk to your boss so I can complain about you then I went off because how does that work when you fucked up my order and it wasn't prepared hot and fresh as promised. The drinks were wrong and everything and that Philly cheesesteak was really fucking disgusting no flavor at all ! So he proceeds to yell at me and before my mouth got real bad I just hung up on him. I told my boss thank god I am changed woman he was beyond rude and disrespectful getting mad because he fucked up lol weird. With all this being said that place will never get anymore of my damn money especially with him working there fucking Obo or Hoboa or Hobo whatever his name was. Talking about \" my friend my friend listen \" ... I had to tell no we not friends stop calling me that shit."}
{"text":"Lunch special was fantastic! Great value and HUGE slices. Will definitely come back. We came in on a whim and they were friendly and fast. The pizza was delicious as well"}
{"text":"Ordered big for the office. Messed up our order and staff had to wait almost an hour. They didn't give us new fries so they were like rubber. Wings were under done and tasteless and a large anti pasti was well ...not. For the 40+ bucks we spent we could have eaten like kings.  Never again."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza and was expecting it to be a bit of a wait because it was the weekend. 2 hours later and I still did not have my pizza. I called the restaurant and they were so confused and told me that my pizza wasn't even ready. I was so angry that I had to cancel my order. I understand it's a big city but come on...2 hours..?!! That is insane and unacceptable. I will not be using them again."}
{"text":"I choose no star for the horrible service, but 3 star for the food. The second Time we went There, we tried the Garlic balls and we do really love it. But the third time, we went there we complained to them about the garlic balls wasn't the same as before, they only put lil bit garlic butter and the appetizers came together with the main course at the same time and it was needed for almost 45 minutes to waited those foods, Even only 2 family at that time. The guy seems unhappy and he said we must add $1 for extra sauce, didn't say sorry but only gave a reason that only 1 chef in the kitchen. That's pretty weirdo, they didn't wanna accept complain for their service?!?! Today same guy was there and we ordered same food but he remembered us, never learning, out complain is still the same as before. We don't know how to complain to them anymore. We love the food and the location nearest by our house but the problem the guy seems doesn't like us because we have complained to him."}
{"text":"Hands down, best pizza in Henderson. This is me and my fiancé's go-to for whenever we don't feel like cooking. I've tried their other menu items; mostly decent, but their pizza is second to none. Seriously....my favorite is just plain cheese! It's the only way to fully respect their sauce and dough!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering their super late night delivery for almost 5 years.   It's 3 am and I am eating :)     Their delivery takes a long time, but I live almost to lake mead, so I am glad they deliver!!!    Everything I've ever ordered has been delicious, and tonight's smorgasbord is right on par :)    I'm eating the spaghetti and meatballs, a gorgeous egg chef salad, and 2 cannoli.   The cannoli look extremely fresh, like someone just put the cheesy stuff in!!   I'm glad I ordered extra meatballs.   I was reading the reviews and someone said meatballs and it sounded really good.    I really like their pizza, especially the chicken ranch, or creating my own.   I don't usually like pizza, so this says something :)"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and it's delicious! Got the meatball sub with mozzarella sticks. Taste home made and fresh. Can't wait to try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"This thick crust Sicilian piece of shit doe ball don't waste your time or money. Had to be the worst pizza I ever had. Red Barron would be light years ahead!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. Had delivered twice now. Always fresh and hot. The garlic balls are great too. Price is a little on the high side though, but worth it"}
{"text":"Greasy cheezy good pizza! The wings are hot and tasty and you cant beat the late hours."}

{"text":"This is the best place of Las Vegas Nevada for pizza. I love Napoli Pizza better than any other pizza restaurant. Dominos is nasty, Pizza Hut is always cold and Papa John doesn't deliver from where I live. However when I go to the bathroom at Napoli, there's poop and doo-doo all in the toilets. Ewwwww ! Napoli has the BEST Pizza, but needs to maintain cleaness in their restaurant."}
{"text":"This pizza amazing. I have been coming here for about 17 years and the food is only getting better. It's a small quiet place with outstanding food. They also got outstanding garlic knots. Don't be shy stop in and grab a slice or a dinner...."}
{"text":"The night crew is amazing in this beautiful restaurant. I always feel welcome and they treat me as if we were friends. I absolutely love this location. I recommend 100%. (-:"}
{"text":"I'm never ordering from here again. I've tried to give them chances and they just plain suck- as in service and timing. Food is fine but I greatly dislike they way they treat their customers and I hope management flips 180 and realizes it."}
{"text":"Was there Tuesday for dinner absolute worst pizza we've ever gotten in our life waited very long for it when the place was almost empty !!! pizza was burnt on the bottom but raw on top how was that possible the girl Gloria who was at the counter was very rude didn't seem to care management wouldent even  bother to talk to us worst  experience worst restaurant worst pizza  worst service I've ever had in my life we will never go back beware of this place"}
{"text":"Still waiting for carry out pizza after nearly an hour, when they say 30--45 min on pick up and they don't start it until you get there I'm ticked. They are busy but tell me the truth when I order.  Crap \"service\""}
{"text":"I reviewed Napoli on Sahara a couple of years ago and I was sold on it. Great food, great prices and quick delivery. I've moved since then and now order from the Napoli over here on the east side of town on Warm Springs, I think. Three words: don't do it. No matter how hungry you are, don't do it.

I spent $40 for garlic balls, two small drinks, desert and one entree that came with salad and garlic bread. Pricey, yes, but I liked their food. Or so I thought.

First, the guy forgot the garlic balls. I called to let them know and they said they'd give me a credit. Nope. Not gonna happen, send his happy butt back here with my money. 

In the meantime, we opened the baked ravioli container and almost lost it. The marinara sauce was swimming in water,like the cook neglected to drain the pasta before saucing it. It was dark brown, too, not a rich red. When we dug in, the whole mess was cold. Cheese congealed over the top, watery sauce and the marinara sauce had so much basil in it, it was like eating a hot chili pepper. Then, to top it off, the garlic bread was old and hard.

We ended up throwing the entree and bread down the drain and split the tiny salad and figured we'd have the desert and be somewhat not hungry. Wrong again. The cake was stale and hard. Even the frosting looked old. Like it had been around for way too long.

So, basically, I paid $40 for two drinks and a tiny salad. I called the manager and he said he was going to check with the cook. Check this out: he comes back to the phone and tells me \"The cook says there was nothing wrong with the pasta.\"

Unbelievably awful food, even worse customer service and their prices? Who are they trying to kid? Stay away, folks, Napoli used to be good and now it's garbage."}
{"text":"Do not order from here. Delivery time is terrible, food is alright (you're not missing anything.) Read other reviews, and order from other available resteraunts."}
{"text":"I used to order from here once a week. The pizza was the best and the service was on par. Lately though the pizza has been stale and for some reason the delivery driver always calls and has asked me to come out to his car and pick up my delivery. Good service has been lacking from this place lately."}
{"text":"Descent pizza for the price. Absolute crap for service. I stopped using there delivery because it would take an hour and a half to get a pizza. Well picking up has got just as bad. They say 30 min and I show up in 20 and got attitude for asking about my pizza after sitting for another 20 min. 45 min to PICK UP a pepperoni pizza. Not worth it!"}
{"text":"Ordered meat lovers pizza and garlic balls. Total was suppose to be $35. But when I delivery man came he told me that the total was $37 I see he wanted a tip I was going to give him a tip anyways but after that he didn't get anything. And when I ordered on the phone the lady was rude and hung up the phone once she told me my total. And last but not least I paid extra for a lot of ranch and it was missing from my order. I tried calling them back and no answer. Never again am I going back."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I order lunch here quite a bit. We call the order in and then pick it up. It seems almost every time we do that, our order is somehow incorrect. We're either missing a side of something or even a whole meal will be missing. 

The food is good but if you're order is a carry out meal, make sure you check for everything before driving away!"}
{"text":"Decent little pizza shop to stop and get a single slice of pizza for a reasonable price.  Quick service, small quaint atmosphere and a decent tasting means you can't go wrong with this place.   It's nothing fancy inside but gets the job done if you're  only after a piece or two.  Highly recommend the square pizza over the regular."}
{"text":"Yeah, I don't know what happened but the Napoli's that was beside GVHS was way better.
Ordering baked ziti was easier and yet better. I have also had difficulties with their menu posted online. This is their menu and to say that their online menu is outdated goes along with management. Please manage your ads if don't plan on honoring them.
The pizza is still very good but everything else is sub par. Their potato skins cost 6.99  and the order consists of 5 pieces of small potatoes but very little goes into preparing. I can do what they did in the time I waited for my order (placed order at 5:54 and left at 6:40). They probably wrapped 3 potatoes in a wet paper towel and zapped them in the microwave for 5 minutes, halved and cored them, then poured some cheese wiz and sprinkled them with chopped bacon and chives. Then put them back in the oven for 5 to 10 minutes more. That make up is the sign of a cook who hates his job.
As I sat their for 30+ minutes, my chair faced the hand washing sink. They must have had 8 employees traversing kitchen area to outside to cashier back to kitchen and serving in-house guests. But that sink did not have one single use. 
The hallway to the restrooms was lined with the boxes used to contain outgoing pizzas- 2 stacks had their plastic partially removed with inside part facing out. Meaning that anyone going to or fro the restrooms can easily touch those boxes, and though it is proper to clean hands after visiting such, it is not always done.  Unless they remedy that situation, I would not recommend ordering their giant or 14\" pies."}
{"text":"The fried zucchini was really good. My pizza was good except on the inside side of the box there was a very thick grease (almost think Crisco) it made about 3 pieces very slimy and nasty so I they didn't get eaten. Also when I ordered I was told 15-20 minutes. Make sure you check on you order though. I ordered there and was told 15-20 minutes about 25 minutes later I realized that they may have forgotten. My food was done they just didn't come out and give it to me. I will try here again mostly for the fried zucchini though."}
{"text":"I ordered tonight since i had a long day at work and didn't feel like going out just to grab groceries and cook.  I'm a chef with a culinary degree so i realize I'm pickier than most but that being said i can get down with the rest of them and enjoy stiff from other places.  Even tacos from taco hell.
I ordered baked ziti and a cannoli. I love cannolis, im from jersey.  So to start you get a small salad. Which looked appetizing but everything tasted like the fridge.  If you've ever had lettuce or veg that's just been cut and in the fridge without proper containment you'll know what i mean.  It's gross.  
Onto the ziti.... it looked appetizing and was a huge portion. Lots of cheese,  was so Lobb forward to it.  However, it tasted completely bland.  I dunno how you can do that with all the different cheeses and sauce but they did.  The ricotta wasn't  seasoned,  the noodles were total mush abs it tasted like the sauce was just canned tomatoes with no seasoning.  Garbage. 
To add insult to injury i stopped eating after a few bites,  my appetite ruined (i dunno if you've ever craved something so bad and then when you got it and it was so far from expectation that it just instantly kills your hungry,  that's what happened to me)
I figured ok can't really mess up a cannoli, right?  Wrong.  They make it look stuffed but really its a hollow she'll they just put some filling on each end abs call it good and charge you 4 bucks. For one.  
Not only that but i waited an hour for delivery.  
Never again."}
{"text":"Total garbage. When I called in our order, the bubble brain was trying to hurry me off the phone and picking up other lines as we spoke. Got a Philly cheese steak with a solidified gob of cheese over the top and the meat tasted gross. The canoli isn't even a damn canoli, it's frosting in a canoli shell. Never again."}
{"text":"Furious about their customer service! I wish i could rate it a \"0\" I would watch out for their creditcard machine as it read other card number. On top of that \"T. Movo (must be some kind of \"manager\") was an a** when I showed him on my phone how my card had gone thru and he still wouldnt approve it so he charged me again. Never and I mean NEVER am I going ever again."}
{"text":"Every time I go here the lady behind the counter seems really rude. Not to comfortable solely on customer service.  Foods worth a try other than that not my favorite place to go."}
{"text":"Best pizza in vegas by far. Closest thing to real NYC pizza! Pick-up special lg 1 topping for $8.00 can't beat it and the staff is great. Anytime I've gotten delivery it's been quick and the"}
{"text":"Ok first of all, I love pizza, so that makes me somewhat biased to begin with. I enjoy their thin crust New York style quite a bit. The sauces they have are good, though they are not always put on the same from pizza to pizza. The cheeses are good. I enjoy the plain cheese, 5 cheese pizza, ranch style etc. I'm basically down with any of their pizzas, as long as it doesn't involve mushrooms!"}
{"text":"the food was garbage. pasta fagioli had no flavor it was bland that was the biggest disappointment"}
{"text":"They music that is so loud, I could not hear the ringing in my own ears. He lowered the volume on request from night club to outside concert but not without some cuss words."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, took over an hour.  Food was horrible. Ordered bruschetta and it came on a hoagie roll with slices of tomato and garlic. Not any bruschetta I've ever had. Ordered the Mexican cheeseburger, no guacamole and 2 small slices of avocado. I called manager and he said they don't make guacamole, but yet it's on the menu.  Horrible, will never order from them again."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place too.  However my 1st experience was not.  I order the special $5.99 pizza special and apparently they forgot to cook the order until I came to the girl at the front. She said she would check but did not until I came to the counter 2nd time.  She finally went to the back and I recd my order 45 minutes later. and I told the girl to wrap it up as my lunch time was over.   She kept saying \"Im sorry so sorry\".  I think they totally forgot about it.  The pizza was good but not sure If I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of pizza or Wings however I did see that this pizza joint had fried zucchini and I had to try. I called in my order and was advised it would be about 20 minutes before I could pick up which I was okay with considering it was around dinner time. I arrived and pick up my order and once I got home I took a look at it and was not impressed. There was a decent portion of fried zucchini in my box however there was a tiny little cup of ranch in it. After tasting it I was even more disappointed because it was quite greasy and there was really no crunch to the zucchini. Safe to say I will not be returning nor will I be telling anyone about this place."}
{"text":"We always order pizzia from work here.  
The 30 inches. But for home. Make sure you tell them easy on the cheese!! Orther wise your good."}
{"text":"Great pizza but.. the girl working the counter made me not want to come back.  When I call to place an order they are so annoyed and rude when you ask questions and they hang up on you!  Hire girls who make people want to return."}
{"text":"Update!!!! Okay, so I'll start with this: Please, please, please! BELIEVE the negative reviews of this business, and I use the word \"business\" loosely. Those reviewer's who have commented that the people working at this establishment are unprofessional, lacking in the customer service arena, and are just down right nasty, are spot on in their assessment.

 I've ordered from them in the past, about 5 times, to be exact, and I've always spent close to $80 on each occasion. Up until my last order, (which I did not write a review of) I've been relatively satisfied. My last order was about 7 months ago. The food was not as good as I remembered. Pizza was super salty, fries were old and cold. The wings were just okay, the garlic balls were nothing to brag about and the chicken strips were hard and overcooked. The anti-pasta salad I ordered was alright. But, I let it be, didn't review, just figured they may have had an off night. Whatever, but it did make me hesitant to order from them in the future. Anyways, I never forgot that I once loved their food, though. Their pizza, I thought was the best in town. The wings were delicious too. So, yesterday, March 29, 2017 I had a craving for pizza, and decided to order an 18\" pepperoni and sausage,  wings, and two double bacon cheeseburgers, all of which are available at Napoli's. So, I called in to place an order for delivery. Whoever the woman is who usually answers the phone just doesn't seem customer friendly. When you call in they always just immediately put you on hold. Sure, they quickly say \"Napoli's, can you please hold,\" yet they never ever wait for the customer to respond. And then, you never know how long they're going to keep you on hold. I was on hold for a while before I hung up and called back(keep in mind that this has been the case each time I've called to place an order). Same thing that time around too. So I wait, and wait, then finally a man gets on the line and asks what I want. I begin telling him my order only to be rudely told, \"I cannot hear you,\" or \" I cannot understand you.\" Then all of a sudden my call is disconnected. He seemed impatient and I felt rushed. I never called back and I never will again. 

See, this isn't the first time I've felt that they're just not conducting business in a way that treats customers with respect...at all. And, I know I've previously ordered from them, but I did notice then, as well, that they're just rude for no apparent reason. From my perspective, they do not care the least bit about customers, orders, quality of their food. It's like for them, if it's good it's good, if it's bad well, oh well. If you aren't satisfied with your long delivery wait, hey, oh well, even though you, the customer, were told an earlier deliver time that actually exceeds even 40 min.  I've seen in no way how they compensate for any mistakes they make, rather it's as all on the customer, even if the issue lies on the business owners and employees. That's simply not good business. The goal should be to build a good reputation within the community, by being fair, treating people (especially the one's supporting your business) with respect, and correcting any mistakes that may have been made on the business end. It's not hard. To me, it seems like they do not want paying, and possibly longtime loyal customers. And, I just don't understand it. 

Anyways, though I once loved their food, specifically their pizza, fries, and wings, I can no longer support Napoli's. I can't bring myself to give any more of my money to a restaurant that I feel doesn't value it's customers, and who doesn't take customer concerns seriously. I mean, seriously? I do not recommend to anyone. Support establishments that are consistent and who make customers and the service they deliver to them, a top priority."}
{"text":"I knew it was a wait when I ordered the pizza on Superbowl Sunday at 135p. With delivery totally out I went with pick up option. 2hrs later pizza almost ready. I'm going to give them 3 star rating and will adjust if the pizza was worth the wait. Now if you see this days later and its still at 3stars. Well then you know what it is."}
{"text":"I am tired and it's really late.  You would think at 11pm they would be able to get an order in time.  Helpful hint.  Order your food at least a half hour ahead before you even walk in.  NAPOLI. you are pissing me off.   

Half our and counting."}
{"text":"At first I was disheartened by the delivery time, an estimated 70min. ( Before I'd had issues with other yelp restaurants that brought me the food very late and very cold.) But even though my poor driver got lost, and was very polite about searching through the maze of apartments in 115 degree weather, my food was hot and tasted absolutely DELICIOUS.
Made a post to Facebook it was so good ladies and gents. Will be eating here again."}
{"text":"OK so the staff has been more upfront about how long it takes for deliveries.  The food has been good.  I do think they have the best 18\" pizza in Vegas that I have tried so far."}
{"text":"The place looks sensational!!!! Food is always great and the customer service was real good and friendly. New looks,the cleanness of this restaurant wishes you bone apetit!!!"}
{"text":"Well...I have not been thrilled about the quality of pizzerias since I have been here in Las Vegas (14 months). A lot of mediocre places and many that I will not return to. I was not anticipating anything different, but Napolis gave me a reason to return...yeah! It was just me and later in the evening. I walked in -  it was clean and I was greeted with a smile. The service was exemplary and the Napoli Special I ordered was delivered on a proper pizza tray. The pizza was piping hot and I was provided a ceramic plate with wrapped utensils (read sanitized). After an ample amount of time, my server came to ask if I wanted a refill on my drink or a box. Yes to both questions. The pizza was reasonably priced, $14.99  for a small, 16 inch pizza. Crust was yummy, crisp around the edge but not crunchy. Toppings were dispersed evenly on the pizza and the feta was a good flavor. The only thing that would have made it better would have been a little more generous amount of toppings. I will return and for now, this is my \"go to\" pizza spot. Oh - they have a very diverse menu with what appear to be some great lunch specials. Napolis rocks...the music was great...classic RnR  played low enough that conversation was no problem. I'll be  back!!"}
{"text":"Cold pizza. Charged $5.50 delivery charge! Also charged a $1.00 processing fee! To process what???? Food was not good at all. Boneless wings were overcooked and it took over an hour to be delivered 2 miles away. Bad food for a premium price. Great business motto. I've learned my lesson. I'll take my business elsewhere"}
{"text":"I've always admired Napoli's pizza from afar, but wasn't able to eat it because of the usual meaty toppings. But not today...not today!

I ordered the Calzone online and it was hot and ready when I showed up. $9 might seem like a bit much for a quick lunch, but holy schnikes was it worth it.

Gooey mozzarella and ricotta cheese wrapped perfectly in a snuggie of dough, garlic, butter, and Parmesan. This place is a must try for pizza lovers."}
{"text":"Don't know what it is about Vegas, but customer service seems not to be a requirement, nor is it part of staff training. Food was good, but the lack of service takes it away. There is no reason it should take almost an hour(46 minutes exactly) to fix one pizza,a salad, and clam strips. They handed me excuses rather than accountability, and apology. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Ordered the Mexican Pizza and wings. Didn't know what to expect but it was delicious. Takes about 45 min for your order but worth the wait. My wings were hot and crispy. That sauce is amazing. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Very Very bad first experience.  Ordered an appetizer and a pizza.  Pizza came out quick so I asked about the appetizer, they'd check.  Only when we were finished with the pizza and up asking for a box and what happened to the appetizer, did a gal run to the back and miraculously the raviolis is done.  

One of the people at the front counter was arrogant about the meaning of the appetizer.  In addition i asked the person who took our order about refills on the soft drinks and she said she would come by the table,  never did.  Way over priced drinks with no refills.  

Go to Sammy's way better food, better service."}
{"text":"Hour wait for a dine in pizza. At some point they have to tell pickup and delivery customers it's going to a long wait and focus on the people sitting in their restaurant."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been here. Whoa, not digging the new decor at all! And to me the seats and benches are very uncomfortable, guess to get you in and out as quickly as possible, which is kind of funny because it takes forever to get your food. Looks more like a coffee shop than a pizza restaurant.  Don't get it,  the other style fit so much better. And what's with the Techno music? Used to be good classic rock. To top it off, they increased prices to pay for this mess. So won't be spending anymore time here but I'll order to go or delivery. Food still rocks though."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place has gotten worse rather than better.  I've ordered once a week for about a year and over the past month service and taste has declined tremendously. The cashiers are grumpy and seem to be bothered to help you, the food taste has declined, not very flavorful.  My last order was the last straw. After I arrived home, I noticed my order was missing an item. When I called,  I was asked to go back.  I barely got a \"sorry.\"  Had I not stood there I probably wouldn't have gotten that.  Waste of gas, time and money, it was so flavorless.  It's to bad, when this place was at the top of their game it was the best in the area, unfortunately it's now just a run of the mill pizza joint.  It will be a long time before I spend my dollar here again unless changes are made."}
{"text":"Called and placed an order at midnight. Specifically requested for driver to call us before knocking on the door since we have two dogs that bark at the slightest noise outside the door, even was willing to walk downstairs to meet them so they wouldn't wake the dogs. Our apartment complex has strict noise hours and was trying to be respectful. Driver showed up early, which is great, but knocked on the door because the person taking the order never put it in the receipt. as soon as the driver left we called the store and the person who answered the phone was rude and stated that they are the manager and that there's 3 receipts and it's written on there. Tried to explain to the manager that the driver and us looked at the receipt and he failed to write on there that we requested a phone call and no knocking on the door. He kept saying he wrote it on there. Will never go back there based on there horrible customer service."}
{"text":"my boyfriend and i love this place and eat here regularly. i have never been disappointed with their food. the pizza is delicious. their burgers are massive. my favorite is probably their buffalo crispy chicken salad. they have great take-out and lunch specials. staff is always friendly and helpful. i love that they are open so late. 

the only thing i would say is that their \"fast delivery\" - is not so fast. i wait at least an hour every time i make a delivery order. if we decide to eat there, we always call half hour prior to put our order in. however, i would say the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Good food, really can't complain. Would prefer this over other places to order from on Grub Hub. They do say fast delivery which is so far from true, an hour to an hour and a half is not fast. My one and only really concern....they really should tell their drivers to put deodorant in their cars in this heat. It's killer when every time they deliver the different guys smell so heavy in B.O."}
{"text":"This is my first and last experience with this place!  I was quoted an hour delivery time and after about an hour and 10 minutes I called to check on my order.  The lady I spoke with told me my driver had left a long time ago and she called the driver for an ETA, she then told me he'd be another 10 mins! So after waiting an hour and a half for my food, my order finally shows up... cold and half of it was wrong!  Never again!"}
{"text":"this place has great tasting pizza and chicken fingers but it is so expensive!:( I wish I could give it more stars, but I also wish I could eat here more without draining my wallet. the have tons of different food to order, all fresh cooked. everything I've had from here is great! they take about an hour to deliver (pretty lengthy) but since it's fresh and delicious it's worth it. 
i would recommend this place to dine in/pick up and if you barely order food or are going to share with multiple people!"}
{"text":"Love this place. MY favorite place to get pizza ever! MY one downside to this place is how long you wait for your food and the staff just doesn't seem to care about the customers but the food is good enough that I always come back anyway!"}
{"text":"For 16.99 this is what you get (see picture).  Sloppy lasagna(didn't find any ricotta), garlic bread, small salad with ranch dressing (actually asked for honey mustard)"}
{"text":"We were craving for pizza and this place definitely satisfied our craving. Our server Harut was friendly and attentive. We both ordered a lunch special and we waited less than 10 minutes for our order to come out. The lunch special can definitely feed two people and the pizza slices were huge. Napoli's is definitely one of my favorite pizza joints in Las Vegas. Thank you Napoli!!!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza they have a carry out special that is amazing. The pizza sauce is good and if you like  bread nots and parmesan wings you will love there's.
They have three locations but it's not like a chain they hand toss their pizza .
Also called in order with Mila she was very helpful. There was a line but they moved it fast when came to pick up a pizza."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the pizza here is great! That said if you want good service I don't recommend going here. I ordered a pizza the morning of Super Bowl Sunday and was given a time of 1:30pm to pick up. I arrived at 2:00pm and stood in a makeshift line where I was cut in front of several times. When I got to the counter the girl found my ticket and charged me $30.00 for my pizza. She left with my ticket and said Ill be right back with your pizza. 30 minutes later the same girl comes from the back and never addresses me. She begins to help other customers. I approach a different employee and ask her where my pizza is. She goes to the back and comes out with a large man who tells me that my order has been canceled. I never canceled the order! I explained to him that I didn't cancel the order and that I just wanted my money back. The large man said I could wait for my pizza instead. I told him that I would not be waiting two hours for a pizza I ordered ahead of time. I also asked why they had charged me and made me wait 30 minutes if the order was canceled. I was not given a coherent answer. I couldn't even understand what the guy said. After i insisted on my money back the guy started the return and moved to several registers as he threw things around. I asked him why he was mad at me since I'm pretty sure they gave away my pizza and tried to blame it on me cancelling it. He said \"I was talking to her not you sir\". I told him that I didn't appreciate his attitude and that he should be nicer to his coworker also. After a long wait my return was processed and I left WITHOUT PIZZA! Do not go here if you're hungry or expect to be treated like a person!"}
{"text":"Just left this place. Let me tell you about the pizza it was greaser then a mechanic after doing a oil change. The pizza was as thin as the cardboard box it came in and barely ANY sauce and too much cheese. Then I ate the boneless chicken and it was completely salty. HOWEVER the add on fries was only a $1 and was the best thing we bought... Asked the \"owner\" for a refund and he told me he doesn't give out refunds for greasy pizzas because the topping was pepperoni. I've had plenty of pepperoni pizzas and none were EVER this greasy. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"I just ordered the pizza from here... It's perfect!!! The crust, sauce and the toppings... Amazing taste... Will sure be a frequent customer... Keep it up guys."}
{"text":"Not bad, nothing to rave about.  

First the winners:  Homemade Italian Wedding Soup was excellent.  Onion rings were very good flavor - beer battered and good seasoning.  Nice.

Two thin crust cheese pizza's - OK.  Much prefer the Gateway Grill on Northside Blvd. less than a mile away."}
{"text":"I went there last night with my girlfriend for some take out.  I have the receipt in front of me to remind me to post...
1 Antipasto
1 Chix Fett Alfredo
1 Peroni (while I waited)

25.93

Paying more than 15.00 would have been too much.  The salad was not worth 5.50.  The chix fett was....bland...and I am kicking myself for paying 13.99 for it.

All well....I hope this helps someone else....

Rob-"}
{"text":"Wow! 3 hrs for my pizza to arrive,  cold with no cheese and burnt.  They forgot my side of hot sauce for my fingers and my fries. The wings are far from crispy. I was really looking forward to this place but I'm so disappointed.  Unfortunate. The delivery time said 45-75 minutes and it took 3hrs! I understand it was Superbowl today but 3 hrs and it was burnt with no cheese!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! I ordered 2  sandwiches for $18.00 thru GRUB HUB at 8:15 PM for 9:30 delivery and was charged $33.00. Delivery showed up at 10:30 after I left for work and the Napoli manager said they would drop off the saved sandwiches tomorrow! Thanks to GRUB HUB customer service, Stephanie, for getting the charged reversed. I live in Las Vegas and will never order from Napoli pizza again! Thank you GRUB HUB for saving my money!"}
{"text":"At first the food was great I loved this place ordered from them all the time. Then one afternoon I placed an order and waited 2 hrs for my food. When my order never showed I called the restaurant to find that they canceled my order without a reason or an explanation. The woman on the phone was extremely rude to me and then just handed the phone off to a man who was even worse he even hung up on me when I asked if I could just place another order and pick it up. After that whenever I placed an order my food was always over cooked or just plain gross so I just stopped ordering and going to them all together. A little tip for anyone who wants to eat here go somewhere else because as you can read in other reviews the woman who works the counter is extremely rude and the other staff will treat you just as cold hearted if not worse."}
{"text":"Went there with a large group of about 20 people. Gary and the entire staff were amazing! We ordered a lot of food and they got it out to us super quick, attended to our every need and the food was great! Thank you so much for such a great experience yesterday!!"}
{"text":"It took over 90mins. The pizza was soggy and not great. It's really overpriced too. One time was enough."}
{"text":"Everything about the pizza is great! It's thin crust, the cheese is melted perfectly, and the taste is great. The only downside is that it takes forever to deliver. But you have to expect that when you order quality food!"}
{"text":"This place isn't consistent at all. Over the past five years coming here their food ranges from great to really bad. Really Bad taking first spot though. 90 percent of the time the food is gross. The pizza is what I'm basing this on. The crust is sometimes great and sometimes like cardboard. I always ask for light cheese and it varies every time I get it. From the perfect amount to literally NO cheese on it at all. Last time I got it the person didn't put any cheese. So when I called back the person on the phone was really rude and said well we put light cheese and gave no option to get another pizza. I even said I'll bring it back. Clearly I can just see tomato sauce and toppings there is no cheese. The customer service is really bad. They are as rude as can be. Like they are doing you a favor for you eating or ordering from there. your a burden. They will see you waiting and then walk right past you without even a I'll be right there and then walk past you again right to the back. I won't ever come back here again."}
{"text":"I have only tried the pizza and the wings. The pizza is not so great, I actually found a hair in it one time. the wings were good but greasy. I do like that is is open 24 hours."}
{"text":"We ordered the pizza and it was good.  Half pepperoni and onion and half sausage and mushroom.  Well done.  And the crispy chicken salad was very satisfying and delicious.  we also ordered medium wings...just a note...mediums are quite hot.  We loved them but they might be too spicy for some.  Delivery is always under the time that they quote.   It's a nice place to have in the neighborhood.  Cute bistro and good food."}
{"text":"I grew up in NY with real pizza & this is about as close as I've been able to find in Las Vegas. The service for take-out was fast & friendly. The pizza & hot wings were fresh & tasty. This will be my new take-out & delivery pizza joint. No more Domino's or Pizza Hut for me."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review before I've even tried the food. Why? Because I ordered a cup of soup, mozzarella sticks, and cheese bread sticks for delivery and as I'm typing this it has been an hour and 17 minutes. It CANNOT take longer than 5 minutes to put mozz sticks in a deep fryer and some soup in a bowl. I don't care if this is the best junk food I've ever had, not worth an hour and a half.


*Edited after food arrived exactly an hour and 36 minutes after order* 

Mozzarella sticks were cooled, the cheese in the middle was solidified. Cheese bread sticks are soooo good. The marinara served with it has a hint of spice. SUPER YUM. The soup was scalding hot. Driver was friendly actually. My guess is they made each item 20 minutes apart mozz sticks first, soup last (lol jk). All in all not memorable enough to pay another $25 for, even if I switch to pick up."}
{"text":"My opinion and review of Napolis $30 lunch that I paid for the other day is what amounts to a small Greek chicken salad 8 inch diameter plate and a $9 cheesesteak that is basically 4 inches of bread (see pic), 8 1/4 inch cubes of chicken and a slice of provolone.  OH and don't FORGET THERES ALSO A  a 1$ processing fee?? A built in delivery fee $2.50 and average flavor and pitiful value.   Do yourself a big favor and patronize any other mom and pops restaurant that gives you value for your money.  There's a reason why CHAIN restaurants do so well in United States and it's because they give you value for your money mom-and-pop stores in a lot of cases don't deliver and Napoli pizza is one of them.     
I hope you heed my advice,  SKIP Napoli Pizza it's nothing spectacular compared to a lot of the other local mom-and-pop restaurants that sell pizza in Las Vegas. It's absolutely a rip off for what you get for your money I'm sure that they use very cheap mozzarella cheese on their pizzas because their pizzas are no better value and pizzas are one of the most profitable items in the food industry.    Just sharing my opinion hope it helps"}
{"text":"I love coming here! I love the convenience of it being open so late and the pizza is always amazing. I'm always craving it! Keep on doing a great job guys!"}
{"text":"Always good pizza! Their pick up special large one topping is really the best deal. The pizza is close to NYC pie. Don't buy mine anywhere else"}
{"text":"The manager at this Napoli's is incredibly rude! This is the second TERRIBLE experience I've had with this restaurant! Beginning with receiving a disgusting meatball sub that was soaked at the bottom causing the bread to be gummy & wet. It was the worst sandwich sub I've ever experienced. Upon calling the restaurant, the manager refused to replace the sandwich without it being brought in. I brought in the sandwich displaying its soaking wet bottom, & at that point he decides to apologize and replace it with something else on the menu. With my forgiving personality I decided to let go his brashness from earlier on the phone when he rudely told me he would do nothing for me. Now upon calling his restaurant two months later to give it another try. He as my number listed as no service. Worst service I've received from anywhere! I believe the manager'a name is Harry! Replace him, and I guarantee your restaurant will generate lots of additional revenue. The customer service is lacking to say the least with his leadership. Highly disappointed!"}
{"text":"Square cut sicilian pizza is amazing. Can't go wrong for 1.50 a slice!!! Always ate in, never tried delivery."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is great! Customer service is wonderful they always get my order right!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give a review about the quality of this pizza but it was so cold, I can't tell you if it was good. I felt \"processed\" by both my hotel and this joint. What a waste of money. We didn't even eat it.

I called to discuss it. The response was rude and inappropriate. Avoid this spot if you expect a good experience."}
{"text":"I've had a couple of encounters with napolis pizza, and each time I've ordered the delivery has always been the worst part. 

I recently had a delivery driver ask me for a bigger tip than 6 bucks????? Who does that. 

But the food is good! So maybe I'll just go pick it up next time so I won't have to deal with the delivery part. Or maybe they should just fire them lol."}
{"text":"so my family and I ordered from this place several times a month. And the food has always been good. But it the little things! especially when they tell you that there is an extra charge for cocktail sauce and when the meal is delivered it is salsa. Really fried shrimp and 
Salsa?
 Just pay attention to the condiments especially if there is an extra charge!!"}
{"text":"The Food is good, I always order from here for my job we spent around $200 to $300 at least twice a month, my only complaint is they need better customer service, the girls are  very rude and if you call them they will put you on hold then will hung up on you. I suggest to hire people that really wan to work and provide great customer service"}
{"text":"I ordered from here yesterday kind of was skeptical because I thought it might be different or taste different or worse then the location on Sahara on the south part of the valley but the food actually turned out to be good I got a order of 20 piece chicken wings they were delicious and 2 orders of fries one for my friend the other was chili cheese fries for me they were good the only negative on that were that some of the beans were kind of hard and dry but it was still good the other negative is they only gave me one pack of ranch when I asked for 2 or 3 but other then that I wouldn't mind ordering from this location the next time I visit my friend or spend the night at her house."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places on the East side, and possibly in Vegas.  Not only is everything fresh, but they deliver (www.eat24hours.com).  Not only pizza, but pasta, wings, and Italian dinners.  Great prices."}
{"text":"Must say we were kind of disappointed!! We have been coming here for around 6 years and we stopped by and it has been completely remodeled !! The look is not authentic in any way ! There was us and another couple yet there were 4 other tables that were dirty and still had dishes and food on them and the young lady at the counter was not as nice as the girls that have helped us in the past !!!

The food was still great ... We split a Steak Bomb sandwich and fries!! The sad part was we waited a very long time and then I saw it was brought out of the kitchen and place on the counter where it set for around 6 minutes or so before I went up and grabbed it myself ! There was an older man that came out of the back stuffing his face and completely ignored me when I went to ask him for help!! 

The decor on the inside is all new but cheap , you could see some of the molding all ready coming apart and the TVs on the walls were way to High for anyone wanting to watch TV. I miss the older Decor and service and probably will not go back or order from them in the future."}
{"text":"I order the pizza from them it was delivered and clearly dropped on its left hand side when I called to complain to the manager I was accused of dropping the pizza myself terrible service"}
{"text":"This is legitimately the best Pizza in Las Vegas and Henderson.  Their garlic balls and wings are also fantastic.  I order from these guys at least once a week.  They take quite a bit longer to deliver (1 hour) than most places, but it's always been worth it."}
{"text":"They have the best pizza and most amazing ranch dressing. The o my thing I didn't like was I got the Reuben sandwich the bread wasn't grilled just toasted. The seasoned fries are really good too. The do have good service."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here a few times and even items that weren't my favorite are still really quite tasty. The pizza is deliciously greasy because there's an absolute ton of cheese.  Delivery DOES take longer in the morning than at night, but they're polite and helpful if you call to ask about your order status.
Their delivery drivers are always incredibly pleasant."}
{"text":"Went Napoli because I got a flyer in the mail with a special 16 inch pizza for $8.99 which I thought was a good deal. When I arrived I ordered the 16 inch pizza with 1 topping of pepperoni along with 10 chicken wings hot and side of fries plus two beers total came to $29.21. The service was excellent had our pizza within 15 minutes, the table arrangement allows for a lot of foot traffic between tables people picking up takeout orders, which makes for a poor dining experience.  The Pizza was too salty and not good, hot wings were good, would not recommend this place, if their signature dish which is pizza is too salty."}
{"text":"Nappoli Pizza is our go to spot for pizza and wings. I've gotten delivery and pick up. Yeah sometimes they're busier than others and you might have to wait a little longer when you get there; no big deal. I like the garlic parmesan wings. If you get the hot wings they are HOT  not your regular hot. Those are good too."}
{"text":"I ordered a child size pasta and I got this. NO SAUCE ON MY PASTA. this is ridiculous. Keep in my I came up late to pick up my order and still had to waste."}
{"text":"We've had Napoli's a handful of times, and every time it is amazing!

The fries are surprisingly tasty for a pizza shop! :) 

The pizza is super good; they have a great deal on their meatball pizza! 

If you're hungry, this is a great place to go. They have a cute patio set up out front, but it's small. Inside is pretty small, but there is a table set up for larger groups. 

If you're eating in they offer wine and beer!"}
{"text":"New to the area, highly recommed ordering on line.  The service was prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"Pizza is great problem is they are super rude. When you call they tell you to hold and slam the phone down without even \"asking\" if you can hold or even waiting for a response. They are not staffed for the amount of orders they take and they show it with the way they treat customers. It's unfortunate because like I said the pizza is great but it ruins the fun of ordering great pizza when you are on hold for so long you end up having to hang up. Good customer service goes a long way."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday and it was very busy. Carry out had a 45 minute wait and delivery wait time was 1 1/2 hours. That was okay I had to get a few groceries next door at Marketon and hubby played one of the video games there.

Ordered the $7.99 1 topping carry out and 20 wings. The girl that rang up the order offered a side of fries for a dollar more. SURE! Why not? only $1 more haha.. We had so much food and left overs for 2 days. Spent just under $25.00."}
{"text":"How do they make pizza so good for so cheap!!!? Seriously! I'm thinking money-laundering operation. Who cares. I challenge anyone to find a better pizza for under $10.00. Get the meatball and black olive."}
{"text":"Pizza is the absolute best thing that people need when going out with friends. Every place that you go to will be diffrent, except for this place. Pizza here is grand, when you order their lunch special. Two slices here will have you stuffed. Slices here are the bigest and thickest you will ever see. They ofer you delicious Ranch where you will dip you're pizza in. Going here will leave you satisfied."}
{"text":"THIS PIZZA IS HUGE. HUGE!

We ordered the pizza a step below the 30\" thinking it would be good for 5 people. We still have half of the pizza left. I ate some for lunch and it was great.

Delivery time is a bit, but that's because it's family owned and the people delivering your pizza usually do everything else at the restaurant, too.

The pizza and wings are good. Their pepperoni & sausage are both great. Some places have crappy meats.

We're going to try the 30\" next week with more than 4 people."}
{"text":"Very rude manager.  My family and I ordered lunch today and I questioned why they required that I sign a credit card receipt from the machine and a manual one.  I have spent 20 years in the restaurant industry and have never experienced this before.  He was extremely rude in his response.  Our order was also missing several items.  Kids meal came without fries and we were missing the garlic bread that was promised with our lunch salad.  Needless to say,  we will never order from this establishment again."}
{"text":"The quality of this place is really declining. Subs are small, overpriced and uninspired. Wings are small and soggy. The quality of the pizza changes with every order and is always soggy. Workers are rude and condescending. Needless to say, I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"I am less than 3 miles away.  I called an asked how much they charged for delivery and I was told $2.50 which I didn't think was to bad. when the driver came it was $4.50. and when I questioned him he said new wasn't in control of that.i need to call the restaurant.  Excuse me!!  their customer service still lacks. I had not ordered from Napoli's  for almost 5 months because of the same problem.  I really wanted their antipasto salad,  and some of their normal ingredients were missing. not happy and do not think I will use you again."}
{"text":"We are done with ordering from Napoli's. We have had issues with delivery before, but we liked the pizza a lot so we would end up dealing with it being late 8 times out of 10. We decided to order from them on a Tuesday night from Bite Squad. I figured it would be a better delivery but I was wrong. Bite Squad didn't deliver, Napoli's did...TWO HOURS after the order was placed. I had to get online with Bite Squad an hour in and they contacted Napoli's and were put on hold for a long time, finally coming back to tell them they needed 25 more minutes till they were able to deliver the order. Good freaking Gawds. They did not get a good excuse from Napoli's. We ended up getting credit from Bite Squad for having to put up with this ridiculous crap.

Driver brings our food, a deep dish pizza and salad. (So not worth the $28.99 they charged for the pizza!) The driver told me that our order had to be remade. WHAT?! We couldn't be called and told that?! The pizza ended up being somewhat warm at best and extremely salty. The antipasto salad was the best item of the whole thing. Two slices of pizza and the rest went in the trash the next day. Worthless.

We are done. Just done."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago so my pizza tolerance is not average... That said, this is more \"New York\" style large slice pizza.  Better than chain pizza for sure!  The menu is large with a wide variety.  They are open till 5AM so late delivery is awesome!  I love the Pastry Pizza! 

Negative
-most items are over priced $$$
-No incentive for return customers 
-I would eat here more often if the prices were more reasonable 

Positive:
-Delivers Late!!!!!!!!
-Huge Menu
-Pasta is great
-Pastry Pizza is one of a kind
-Decent Price
-Order online is easy"}
{"text":"Really good pizza! Not sure if they are related to the Napoli Pizza in Squirrel Hill or not but they have damn good pizza. They are located in the Miracle Mile shopping center in Monroeville near DSW.

We got pepperoni, mushroom and extra cheese and it was freakin' outstanding! 

It's best to eat the pizza in house or at least wait 10 to 15 minutes for it to cool down and set because the cheese will slide right off of the pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken salad and the Crispy Chicken sandwich.. It was not the best tasting food, I have had worse. It was okay, the plus side is that the salad was crispy, cucumbers were good.. The chicken tasted old and was hard. $27 with delivery and I didn't know there was a delivery charge.. No the best customer service.. Maybe I should have gotten a pizza??"}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new pizza place so I decided to try Napoli. I should have known when I was on the phone placing my order to just hang up. The girl on the phone sounded like she was unfamiliar with the menu. I told her I wanted the 4 item combo pizza and I could hear her talking to someone else because she had no clue what I was ordering. I asked for delivery and she said it would be 45-60 minutes for it to arrive. I thought that was typical for delivery. Over an hour had past, I called them to make sure they got my order. They said it should be arriving any minute. My order arrived 90 minutes after ordering, seriously! I open the box and the pizza looked gross. I ordered onion rings which looked like they used old oil and barely had any onion inside. I also ordered the fried zucchini sticks which is suppose to have a crunch but this was mush. You would pick one up and it would just flop over. This was horrible!! I wish I could of caught the delivery guy in time to return my order! Definitely would not recommend!"}
{"text":"Long time sufferer first time reviewer. I have been riding the Napoli band wagon for a while. I have been a fan of the food especially the wings and pizza. but the service was always lacking. even though we loved the food the lack of customer service made us look elsewhere for our pizza. 

Tonight we gave it one last chance. and what we got was the wrong item. I know what you're saying \"the wrong item hardly merits 1 star\" and you would be right however when that item it comprised from the losing vegetables from the 1957 Nebraska state fair, and made with the same love and devotion that Susan Smith showed her children one star is more than enough. My dogs literally would not eat this and i had to put a lock on the laundry room door to prevent them from eating cat turds."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years to now tell you I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!!!! Their food is great but to many better places to go and not get RUDE TELEPHONE SERVICE AND HUNG UP ON!! I give this place officially a BIG FAT ZERO!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing, food was authentic East coast Italian- reminded me of the clam strips you get back east. Pizza was hot and delicious! Definitely will drive 30 min away to come back."}
{"text":"Pasta was good, but the bread was burnt, dry, literally cut the top of my mouth biting into it. To top it off, they served me a rancid rotten salad. I was stunned. When I called in, because it was a delivery, I sat on hold for 6 minutes and then when the girls finally picked up the phone she asked me what the problem was.  As I was explaining it to her... 4 different time she interrupted me to answer the phone and tell people to hold, came back and said, what was the problem again? 4 times! These people are incompetent, the manager was condedending to me after i asked for him, and the food would have been great if had not been rotten...."}
{"text":"I'm not a big pizza guy, but this was pretty good...  I had the dine-in $5.99 lunch special which includes two extra large slices of pizza and a drink.  One of these slices and I was down for the count.  Seems like an ideal size lunch to share with your sweetheart.

Unfortunately, I don't have one."}
{"text":"I used eat 24 to order my food took about an hour but it was worth the wait! I got the gyro salad, cheese burger, medium boneless wings and clam chowder all was some good grub mmmmm!"}
{"text":"Mostly I use to order the giant 30 inch pizza. And was delicious every time. But tonight the pizza was very thin inside but the crust outside was very thick (over 2 inches) and some places raw. And they used half toppings. But the price was higher than usual. If they hired new pizza guy I hope they fired him quickly. Otherwise they will lose customers."}
{"text":"Never again will I order food here. I used to be a regular customer but the last few times the order wasn't correct and it took over an hour and a half for pick up. It was only two sandwiches!! When you tell someone 30-35 min for their food triple that is just unacceptable."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but wtf it was so bad I've been a costumer for a while and I've given them way too many chances to redeem themselves but nope. I've gotten my soup served cold and tonight I orders mac and cheese fries and some ziti with marinara and I just got fries and some crap ziti that was so al dente that it was hard. I paid for things I didn't even receive. Screw napolies but like they kids meals lit !!!"}
{"text":"Way better than all these $5.00 pizza places (yuck) around me. Took awhile but was worth it. I'm thinking that dining in would be really good!"}
{"text":"As much as I like this place, tonight's meal was a mess..... I ordered the 16\" take out special and half a bucket of wings. After getting home, I found the pizza crust soggy and under cooked. I called and they replace the pizza with a new one. As it turns out, the crust way too thin and couldn't support the weight of any toppings. While biting into the wings, it turns out that they were under cooked as well. I assume that they have a new cook because I have never experienced any food that poorly prepared there in the 7 years I have been going there. It's a shame that this is happening and I hope it gets fixed. I just know that I will not return any time soon....."}
{"text":"Great pizza, hate how people are always negative and never want resolve an issue that they had while a visit. Quit trying to kill small businesses."}
{"text":"I was disappointed last Sunday.  I had been to Napoli's a few times before and was impressed with the service, food, and Italian music playing.  Last Sunday, however, was a horrible experience.  The service was horrible.....We ordered wings and fries....fries were cold and wings looked like slop.....pizza took 45 minutes to come out and we had to ask the bus girl to check on the order ....meanwhile we saw huge quantities of delivery orders going out.  I appreciate that they have delivery orders but the customer in the restaurant should not take a back seat to that.  Further,  there was no Italian music playing but rather old time rock.  The experience may not bring me back and that is a shame because in the past I thought it was great.  Also....I ordered a salad and much of the lettuce was brown :(  This place is really going down hill fast.....they don't even have the checkered table cloths anymore....and when we entered the dining room, even though there were only two people inside, there were many dirty tables :("}
{"text":"Just made my second order. Its the only place in Las Vegas that can understand me when I speak!! Food is great, very friendly staff, they always find my address and deliver food on time! Guy on the phone had a great sense of humor too!!
If you are like me and have had terrible service at Angelina's Pizzeria go to NAPOLI PIZZA!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and wings. Order came 30 minutes late. Delivery driver spoke very RUDELY to me. Food was cold and gave me and my girlfriend food poisoning. Called to complain to manager who also spoke very rudely to me and hung up on me. Overpriced, disgusting, low quality crap that gets u sick and horrible customer service. Wish i could give 0 stars."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery to my work place and the female that took my order was very rude, sounded like a teenage girl who was not very interested in giving proper phone customer service. I ordered 2 salads. (Felt a little healthy) my place of worn is about 4 mins away from their location, took them about 1hr to get here. Didn't know salads took that long to make. I understand with wings, pizza etc, because of cook time. And when my delivery guy got here he eyed  me down as if he had a problem. So as I approached him I asked how it's going and he replies with \"you got the money\"?
I gave him the cash no comment made.
I hand him 50 bucks, he ask if I need change. Mind you my bill is 20 bucks. Yeah mother f**ker I need change!! I ain't tipping you shit after your rude delivery service. If I wasn't a half decent person, that's what would have came out of my mouth. 
Took my change and simply walked away with my food.
When I opened my salads, they where warm as if they where In a oven. It tasted decent. But service was a big disappointment."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, took about an hour. The person answering the phone wasn't to friendly and I almost hung up. Had the italian sausage and it seemed to salty and soggy. The wings I was very impressed with the size and taste for the honey bbq wasn't bad. Kids didn't like the pizza at all but we all agreed on the wings. Slice of pizza and 5 wings left me stuffed."}
{"text":"I am very unhappy regarding this order. We placed our initial order at 542 PM, our order arrived at 7pm. We noticed after the food was delivered that our pizza was missing. We contacted the restaurant and waited on hold for 15 min and was transferred to several different people, and finally I was connected with someone who decided that she would send out the replacement pizza. I asked her how long it would take and she said no more than 30m. After waiting another hour we called the restaurant AGAIN and asked where our food was and she said that it will arrive soon. Finally the delivery arrived the pizza is COLD and the driver didnt offer an apology or even acknowledge that something was wrong. So it took us 3 hours to receive an ice cold pizza and terrible service."}
{"text":"I Love Napoli! They have great pizza and calzones and strombolis ...and everything else is good too! I usually order delivery and it always hot and in a reasonable amount of time. They have so much to choose from.  Everything from pizza topasta, salads to gyros,  burgers, sandwiches, deserts,  dinner entrees... And they deliver until 3 a.m.!  I have actually eaten inside the restaurant also and it's clean and well kept, nicely decorated/good atmosphere and the service is great. They even sell pizza by the slice! The west side location is also just as good. Never been inside that one, but delivery is wonderful! Thank you Napoli!!!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in the city.  Garlic balls and fried ravioli were great.  Great service, great people.  We drive a ways to get here, but worth it!!"}
{"text":"Did indoor dining vs delivery this time- WOW HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! Food is still good but service is a NO GO!! Ordered the $8.99 16\" 1 topping pizza, a hot pastrami sandwich w side and a drink. Lady asked what size fries w wanted w the sandwich (I kept insisting it comes w it but she would reply \"ya but what size\") long of short she charged us for the \"free side of fries\" now we have double the fries but with only 2 ppl how much can we even eat?!! A soda is $4 extra $4 for fries we didnt eat or want. When I ordered the pizza I explained it was to go- it was brought out on a tray... we asked for it to be boxed to go and she tossed a box at us to do ourselves. So now we have a bunch of fries (that were served cold) a pizza we had to try to skillfully toss from a cake tray into a box and a sandwich that didnt have anything listed on it besides meat... wheres the toppings and why did they ask when we ordered if we want everything on it if nothing was going to be placed on it?? We asked for pickles added and we got a olive on the side??! Really?! Why? Even our drink was rang up as with cherry? We never said cherry ever!! I dont get what the issues was but definitely communication issues with the gal seem to make the experience crap! Ill just stick to the simplest order 1 topping pizzas so far they never messed that up!! Ugggg date night failed thanks to incompetent people and rude staff when you explained all the issues- (pizza not boxed to go, no topping on sandwich, cherry in soda and $4 charge for the free side of fries... that were cold)"}
{"text":"Ordered from here a few times and it's really very good.

The Newton sandwich is delicious, my girlfriend orders it almost every time. VERY big sandwich. Chicken is breaded but not mushy.

The Ziti Siciliano is pretty good. The menu doesn't say if it comes with marinera in it, only that it's eggplant, mushrooms, ricotta and penne all baked. It does come with some marinera sauce but upon initially ordering it I requested a side of marinera just in case and it was a good decision to do so. Huge portion, definitely enough for two people so I had more than enough leftover. Eggplant was soft but not falling apart and there was quite a bit of ricotta but it wasn't overwhelming. Really very good. 

I've ordered their New York Style pizza and it was delicious. Ordered it with their alfredo sauce instead of pizza sauce and it was good but definitely lacked garlic. Most alfredo sauce is overloaded with garlic so it was a little disappointing that there wasn't much of it, but I'd rather have less garlic than so much that it's inedible. Next time we'll make sure to have garlic be one of the toppings.

The California Shrimp salad is exactly what it says it is. No complaints on that one but FYI vinagerette isn't the best choice of dressing. 1000 Island would be a better option so the avocado doesn't disintegrate.

The only item I've had that I wasn't sure of is their Breaded Mushrooms. It's not how you would imagine breaded mushrooms. Instead of breadcrumbs it's almost like the mushrooms are covered in a thin layer of dough. Not pizza dough or bread dough; it definitely had a distinct taste that was familiar but unrecognizable. At first bite it was disappointing, not because it tasted bad but because it wasn't what I expected. Of course I did the whole, \"Maybe if I try another I can figure out if I like them\" and by the third mushroom I was all about it and wanted more of them. I would simply say if you order them to keep an open mind.

Really like this place, will be ordering again in the future."}
{"text":"Napoli Pizza. What more could I say about my favorite pizza joint in Vegas.  I have lived in lad Vegas my whole life. I have never encountered a pizza as good as Napoli Pizza. They have the best tasting pizza in vegas. Great staff and some of the best food you will eat In Las Vegas. If you have not tried Napoli. They are worth every penny. I actually think I will be ordering after I leave this review hahahha."}

On top of that the manager isnt there so no refund for 3 to 5 days on a 30 dollar order !!! and no lunch for me today after waiting all that time.... Very disappointed in the service here me and all 75 employees at my company will never order from here again...."}
{"text":"This is the second time pizza has been delivered cold. I believe in paying for quality. I love their pizza but when they said they wouldn't do anything about pizza being delivered cold I decided to not order from them anymore it's bad enough you have to wait for an hour and 15 minutes for your pizza but cold is not what I expected."}
{"text":"Customers Beware! I purchase a pick up special with two toppings on 12/06/17 for $14.07 when I check my bank account the next day I found out that the transaction did not match what my receipt said. They overcharge me by $8.66 on my debit card for a total of $22.73 if they do this to ten people that's $86.66 I attempted to resolve this issue, with the manager and I was blown off and ignored. That left me no other choice but to call my bank and open up a fraud investigation, on the overcharge. I will never purchase another pizza from this establishment because I have been in this establishment numerous times and I feel this is no way to treat any returning customers, I believe the price of a pick up is around $8.99. So in reality, I got charge for two pizza's, It is up to the customer if they want to leave a almost $9.00 tip for a pick-up. (Who does that anyway?) This place should not be tipping itself with other people's money without the authorization of the customer! This is not a ethical business practice."}
{"text":"I would give this place NO STARS but I cannot.  My family spent $67 dollars on sausage pizza, pasta, sausage sandwich, and fried zucchini... WAITED 90 MINUTES (paid cash or they would charge an additional 2 bucks, what?!?!)! 
IT WAS HORRIBLE!!! 
Way too much sodium, my mom's legs swelled up and I could taste salt well after eating the pizza! YUCK!!!
Called for a refund and they would only give us 10% off our next order, WHAT???
The manager was an A$$hole!!! He told my mom to write a letter to the US president if she did not like his offer.
WOULD NEVER GO OR ORDER FROM NAPOLI AGAIN... NEVER!"}
{"text":"We love their pizza! They are a little pricey, but worth it. I ordered online, which was easy and convenient. But my ordered wasn't ready at the time they said it would be, that's the only reason I gave them 4 stars."}
{"text":"7 months later and this place has yet to fail me. You just can't beat the pickup special. It's a 16\" 1 topping pizza for $7.99. We usually get the whole thing with pepperoni and then half pineapple and half sausage. They only charge for 1 additional topping which is cool. Some places will nickel and dime for each additional topping, even though it's only on half the pizza. What I like about this place is they have a dining room, so I get the pickup price, but get to eat it there. Add a basket of fries and some wings, and you have a meal under $25 with plenty of leftovers to take home. They have a lot of other items as well, but the pickup special is too good of a deal to pass up, so I end up getting it every time. And a bonus, they have the freestyle coke machine. Oh and it's family owned and operated! Love that."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting.   I ordered delivery which took close to an hour and 45 minutes so the food was ice cold.  I ordered chicken parm which was dry and tough and tasted disgusting.   The french fries that came with it were soggy and stuck to the sandwich and pasta fagoli that was 3/4 broth.   All for $25. What a waste of money and time.  Would never recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"We have picked up their  take out special a handful of times..although I've never eaten it, the other peeps in our house say it's decent. 
My 1 star rating is because today when I went in to pick up our pizza I was not even greeted although there were THREE girls behind the counter. Doing nothing. And then-One customer went to pay in front of me & so I overheard a conversation between one of the staff and this customer. The customer couldn't understand the employee, and he was trying to give his payment. She was talking down to him that he was taking too long. And then she proceeded to go off on him (while laughing to his face) about how he must be confused or what's wrong with him because he is taking up her time...wow. 
Honestly I can't fault the guy at all for not understanding when she asked him for his payment, I couldn't decipher the amount either! He was simply standing there waiting to figure out what she had said (she has a very thick accent with very broken English). But she's young and I guess she thinks she's attractive because she was so rude to him and kept doing this condescending laugh & eye rolling and flipping her hair etc. This chick needs to get over herself. You don't treat people that way..
What an embarrassing attitude by your employee..although the attitude was not direct to me, it's enough for me to see and never give you our business again."}
{"text":"Pizza here has always been amazing. Not a bad one on the menu but I encourage you to Try the Sicilian cut. Also the eggplant parm sandwich."}
{"text":"This is a good, low-price, late-hour pizza joint in Henderson that I recently discovered.  So far I've tried their pizza, their mozzarella sticks and their wings.  They're all pretty decent quality for a late-night establishment.  The staff is quick and efficient in turning around their on-site orders.  I haven't tried their delivery service so I can't speak to that but if you want to stop by for a late-night bite, they're open until 3am most nights of the week!"}
{"text":"11:30 Sunday night and their pizza is bomb when everyone else is closed. This is what Las Vegas needs"}
{"text":"Napoli has been around for quite some time now, I have been it's customer for over 10 years. We decided to order take out for movie night and tried napolis 

We ordered a 16\" 4 topping topping pizza, wing dings, fries, and garlic bread sticks. The pizza is decent, I wish I would have ordered it well done because it was a bit under. The wingdings come with fries and have different sauces you can choose. We ordered the wingdings with hot sauce, it had very good flavor, My biggest concern with them is that they were heavily breaded and deepfried. It made them very mushy when coated with sauce. The fries were also mushy aswell. The bread was very good when fresh, the next day they were as hard as rocks.

This place is very overpriced now, and over the years they have added many things to the menu that kind of make it over complicated (I'm talking about the non Italian foods).  For me I come here due to convenience, it is very close to my house and is open very late. The food is fresh but the service is a bit sketchy. I can't help but feel like I am bothering the employees when I come in. I would recommend coming here out of desperation,  due to the price being so high."}
{"text":"Definitely not a bad piece of pizza.  Ordered pizza on a Monday afternoon and was told about a special that they had for pick-up which saved us about $6 which is the type of customer service I like!  Picked up our pizza without any hassle and they followed our instructions not to cut the pizza (we had special plans for this one).  I really like that they actually listened to us and were very kind to us.  

The pizza itself was a large cheese and was very tasty and although I don't usually come here due to having other favorite pizza joints around Henderson, there isn't a reason why I won't find myself here again.  

They also have a 30\" pizza which is ridiculously awesome, just putting that out there!"}
{"text":"The food it's bad but what got me is that they advertise a price on their website and when you call the quote you something completely different. I  went from $25.99 online to $34. something when I called to place the order."}
{"text":"I love this place! Quietly tucked in the corner of Miracle Mile this place is a secret treasure. I used to be able to eat their pizza, hoagies, etc. before being diagnosed with a gluten allergy, however I now enjoy their chef salad filled with meat, cheese, and fresh veggies. 
My family loves this place! 
Pizza served by the slice - you can't beat it!"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!!! Do not come here. We waited almost 2 hours for our order. It was not hot and all of our fries were soggy. The excuse...it took too long to come out of the fryer. WHAT?!?!?

When I called and asked why it took so long....the manager just kept giving me the run around. After being condescending, he eventually offered me 10% off and to always expect 1 1/2 wait. No, way will I ever go back there. 

ZERO STARS"}
{"text":"This place ROCKS with tasty food. We were excited to find calories worth eating.  We liked the specials offered on the back of the menu which saved us money. The staff was kind, helpful, and attentive to our needs"}
{"text":"They deserve a 5 honestly but the four is for the wait. It usually takes them at least an hour to get your order ready (due to their popularity they are always slammed. The food her is beyond amazing. The fries are the best fries I've ever had, the wings are delish, the pizza is good, philly cheese steak is tasty. I don't think you can go wrong with any of their food. Calzone is so good too. Small is massive. Proportions are generous. It's worth the price and the wait."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to check this place out with my group the Las Vegas Pizza Posse this evening, and I have to say it was a good choice. They serve \"New York\" style pizza. The crust was tasty and baked to a nice toasty brown so as to be firm, yet soft. The sauce had a good flavor without being overpowering and combined with the sausage and pepperoni for an enjoyable assault on my taste buds. The service was fast, friendly and definitely very welcoming. We didn't sample the famed 30 inch pizza, but I plan on going back and doing just that in the near future. If your looking for a place that says \"pizza\" this is the place."}
{"text":"I stopped in because I saw the Grand Opening sign at their new location.  This was my first visit to Napoli & I probably won't return considering that the pizza and lasagna were only average and pricepoints were a little high."}
{"text":"Just placed a midnight order!  Fries Hot Sandwiches and a salad for $20! Tons of food"}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time tonight and the food was very good! The fettuccine, Capri salad, and the side salads were awesome. The spaghetti was just so so but the meatballs in it had a great flavor. Will defiantly order from here again :)."}
{"text":"I am a pizza snob, especially when it comes to sauce to cheese ratio.  I ordered a 4 topping 16\" pie and let me tell you, it was so good that it was nearly an emotional experience. The mozzarella is killer and you can really taste the savory seasonings in the sauce(say that five times fast).  Idk why I've waited to order so long.(GrubHub led me to them)  If you haven't tried yet, please give them a taste!"}
{"text":"About a month ago I ordered from here and they gave me their little menu to take with me as they always do which has their specials listed on the back. today I go and order the number 15 special Which is to 18\" pizzas, 40 wings, and to Sodas for 59 dollars. The man on the phone was extremely rude to begin with and at the end of our conversation without giving me a total he just hung up. So I figured it would be around $65 after taxes and we waited our 40 minute wait time to  go to pick it up and the same man started off being rude to my wife then went on trying to charge us 80 something dollars for our order and when we advised him that that's not what the special says on our pamphlet he yells at my wife and says well these are new prices. obviously we did not finish or complete our order and we left. There was no customer service at all. Never will I go there again."}
{"text":"I ordered from them at 8:05 and was told  my food would be delivered by 9:05. They are located off of warm springs and Stephanie and I live off of warm springs and pecos. My house is off a major intersection and not at all difficult to find with a map or any GPS program. At 9:45 and two phone calls to the place, I gave up. The delivery driver didn't speak enough english to communicate with. I am astounded that with help from myself and the lady at the store, the delivery driver never found my house. What poor customer service! They need to hire delivery drivers that are smart enough to follow simple directions or look at a map. My food finally arrived at 10:00 and aside from being cold, still wasn't any good.  They charged me full price. Save yourself the trouble and order from rosati's, Pizza Hut, or anywhere else. Don't give these idiots your business."}
{"text":"I will never ever order from this place again. Two freaking hours late with my food and they didn't even give me a discount for being late."}
{"text":"Food is good, however, if and when an order is incorrect customer services needs an over haul.  

There have been 2 separate occassions where an order was placed for delivery, where the order was incorrect and the food was burnt.  Instead of apologizing for their mistake, I was asked if I could just keep the order (which was incorrect and not edible) and get a few $ off my next order (not equal to the amount of my order).  

When I stated that no I could not as this was lunch/dinner, I, the customer, had to request that the food I ordered and/or it to be re-cooked, and delivered again.  I was then asked if the food had been eaten.  Instead of offering the customer to keep the messed up order, it was requested that the food be given back to the delivery driver upon receipt of the original corrected item...

Not pleased."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place, BEST SERVICE EVER!!!!
He manager was fast & making my experience wonderful. The pizza itself is unbelievable & great tasting. The crew was working non stop. Acknowledging every customer that came in. Great pizza place."}
{"text":"I know I ordered my online delivery with 30 something minutes to spare.. I know it can be annoying but let me just say that the food I got was amazing! I've eaten here multiple times and it always will be my go to pizza and wing place :) the people are always friendly and the man who dropped my pizza off in the van - very kind :) thank you again!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza and wings is great here , customer service not so great but reason i come back is for food"}
{"text":"Great pizza. A little slow but a huge lunch special for 5.99. We really enjoyed the crispy crust."}
{"text":"We've ordered from these guys a couple of times now and I've been pretty satisfied with their pizzas. The crust has a nice texture, thin and crispy with enough backbone to hold up to their toppings. We had their vegetarian pizza last and I enjoyed it quite a bit, with lots of olives and cheese as well as a few other toppings sprinkled on. 

We also had a calzone, but I was less impressed with the end result of that one. It was largely dough and cheese with a few toppings, making it really heavy. It wasn't terribly greasy, but all the ricotta was very rich. 

Our delivery time was somewhere around 45 minutes to an hour, which isn't terrible considering the distance the delivery driver had to cover. For a medium pizza and medium calzone our total was around $35, so next time we'll probably upgrade to the next size up and just have the pizza. 

Their menu is pretty extensive, however, so there are plenty of side dishes, pastas and subs to choose from if you're not in the mood for pizza!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Place was clean. Service was great. 4 stars because they don't deliver to my address less than 2 miles away."}
{"text":"Napoli's is the only place I get wings from that I LOOOVEEE. The 4 stars is because it always takes FOREVER to deliver. Always over an hour even tho I'm less than 2 blocks away. I wish they had another delivery driver."}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious it's just a little pricey, and the garlic bread is yummy with the sauce!"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome! They have such a diverse menu with really everything to choose from. Fair prices, and they always have lunch specials going on. The 12 wings for 8 bucks and add a basket of thick cut fries for a buck? Always a great deal. Open til 2 am so its perfect for swing shift workers like myself. Always offer refills on drinks while you are waiting for to go orders."}
{"text":"the pizza here is awesome.  i love it.  delivery does take a while (depending on the time you order) but it seems that the place is family owned and they come and deliver it to you.  can't comment on their other food, but the pizza is my favorite in henderson for delivery.  worth the wait."}
{"text":"Their pizza is just amazing. It's true that they get very busy and there can be a wait. I generally call 30 minutes ahead and pick it up myself, and I haven't had a problem. Maybe getting pickup is better than dine-in or delivery. In any case, I always come back for the Italian Style Pizza. Sooo good with a salad and glass of wine."}
{"text":"Ordered for pickup. They said 30 minutes,  20 minutes later they called asking if we still wanted our order. What the hell.  Or course we do. Went there immediately and another  35 minutes later, still waiting. I  don't know what happened, but the service is not very good. After everything was done it took almost 2 hours to get our food. The owner didn't care about the fact that I was sitting in the car waiting for my husband.  He kept yelling this is America, I  know where I am, do you?  Well they got our money and that truly is the only thing they care about.   Definitely WILL NOT BE BACK . The food wasn't any good.  Ordered extra sausage and onions and got extra cheese instead. Garlic balls were just dough with some cheese sprinkled on top. A huge waste of money. Beware if you are hungry, your wait will be enormous and the food will be garbage and the owner only wants your money.  Their not looking for regular customers, obviously,  to make a customer wait nearly 2 hours and not care,they only want the money."}
{"text":"It may smell nasty in the restaurant but it's a great place to get a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I ordered a Turkey Sub, french fries and a salad two hours ago. Just now arriving to my house. I had to re-fry the fries because they were so soggy and cold. I also didn't receive my salad. Not worth the wait or the money. The bread on my sandwich was also hard as rock. Very disappointed especially considering it is just a Tuesday!"}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery, they did not include cheese on my sandwich, the pizza was stone cold, but the worst part was how rude the worker was when I called.  I will never do business with them again even if they gave me everything for free, HORRIBLE"}
{"text":"I LOVE PIZZA!!!!!!!!!

I'm from California, I was visiting in Nevada and we wanted pizza. So the hotel we stayed at recommended Napoli. We really enjoyed it, the pizza was really extremely good the marinara is very zesty. I will admit that California cheese makes pizza taste awesome. But this pizza is really great, I WILL DEFINITELY ORDER PIZZA FROM HERE AGAIN.

We also ordered mozzarella sticks, diner salad and hot wings. The mozzarella sticks where really bland no taste what so ever. The salad was kinda normal, I mean really how much can you say about a salad, right. The wings where really tasty, but it did not make a big statement they where just OK.

But if you want a tasty pizza, you really need to try this place."}
{"text":"Good pizza, huge menu. Anything you could possibly think of is probably on the menu (probably not a great thing...who knows how long the veal's been in the freezer waiting to be used)."}
{"text":"Ordered two hours early for a party and pizza showed up very late.  Worst customer service ever.  Never received an explanation.  Will never use again and will never recommend."}
{"text":"Consistent is the key to any restaurant to stay in business.  I'm writing this because we have been here about 12/15 times. Always take out. They have a take out special, 16\" cheese w/one topping. We don't get this extra topping, just cheese. We tried the extra cheese but it just becomes too much. We add wings with fries. We order extra crispy on the wings. The 3/4 times we've ordered them it's never crispy.  I decided to write a review because we are now done with Napoli Pizza. It's very frustrating to order take out get home and it's not correct. I trust people get it right. I have to realize it's just people and they make mistakes but now it's just inconsistency. 
This place isn't horrible just check your food when you take it."}
{"text":"We have been eating here for over a year now. You walk in and think.... Just another pizza place. The Pizza is incredible, but there is so much more. The main courses from stuffed shells to veal dishes are absolutely incredible. Fabulous sauces and prepared with very fresh ingredients. They also have a decent amount of wine choices. If you have room.... We have tried every dessert on the menu, ( generally take them home because we are so full), and they are all outstanding. The real supersede is after all of this, the check will not give you a heart attack. We fine the pricing very fair and reasonable. You can also call in and pick up your food to go. Don't miss this place. Take it from an Italian this place is a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer from Napoli, i always order the same thing. however just recently i moved to the east side of town so this location has been closer now and i always call to order for pick up but this past week i ordered from this location and they told me it would be ready around 45 mins but something came up, i forgot to call and cancel my order and they kept calling me and calling me non stop until i finally answered and they told me my order was ready i of course told the manager who i spoke with that i wouldnt be able to pick up because something came up so he laughed and said its okay, (mind you i have never cancelled or anything). 2 days later i called to place an order and the girl said that i cannot call and order anymore and if i wanted to order i would have to do it in person and wait . then the same guy got on the phone and told me that i cannot do phone orders because i didnt pick up my order that one day. he was being such a fucking asshole over the phone so i hung up and he had the nerve to call me back at my work phone. i spend so much money and he was pissed because he lost 10 bucks for the day big fucking deal."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend, since he had told me the place was great. And it was. The pizza was very good, got a basket of lemon pepper wings too, and fries. All was exceptional. Though it was my first time, it was a good experience and I will probably be back to eat at this pizza place."}
{"text":"Meh. Not impressed at all. Pizza tasted ok. Pretty annoyed my spaghetti and meatballs is actually a soup bc they didn't drain the pasta. Prb won't order from here again. Giadas and Angelina's are WAY better options."}
{"text":"Food quality is horrible. The pizza topping were nonexistent, was more like a sprinkle of bacon. The put the wrong sauce on my chicken. Won't order from them again"}
{"text":"Best wings way better than wingstop and cheaper now to try the pizza the fries are ok for the price"}
{"text":"We have family visiting from out of town and decide to take them to our favorite spot. I was so disappointed.  The girls where a little rude and didn't smile. The food took longer than usual and when there was a spill on the floor and we mentioned it to them they didn't come and pick it up for at least 20 mins. The music wasn't playing like it usually is, which always makes part of the atmosphere for me. And then when they brought out the plates a baby roach was on one of them. Wtf?! You could tell the owner wasn't there because we NEVER had this kind of experience when he was there. I'm upset because I love this place and now we won't be going back."}
{"text":"3.5

My sister and her friends came into town over the weekend and of course her being a foodie she was on the Yelp app going through her bookmarks and what was in the area LOL

Seriously who doesn't like pizza?!! My sister insisted on eating here because she said they take too long for delivery, came in on a Sunday night and this place was popping! We grabbed some menus and sat down and talked about what we wanted. We went for two medium pizzas with cheese, sausage and pepperoni. We also ordered some sides:

-Honey BBQ wings: DELICIOUS! It was soo good we went back last night to pick some more up! They fry the wings so good, not overly greasy or dry. Cooked perfectly! I love the sauce, I'm a saucy person so these wings are perfect for me! Also the first time I ordered them I wanted the fries but they didn't give it to us but when we ordered our take out last night and we got the fries and they are huge!! A whole box of fries for a dollar more is a great deal! 

-Breadsticks: OMG I could eat those allll day! They were soo fluffy and delicious! We devoured those!! Especially with ranch! NOM NOM!

-Caprese salad: This was a bit different from other Caprese salads I've had in the past, instead of a balsamic drizzle it had a spicy olive type dressing, I didn't care for it but the mozzarella was sooo good! 

-Pizza: The crust was good but it was dry and lacked seasonings/sauce on the pizza, I really didn't care for it too much but it was a hit for every one else.

We ate pretty good for under $45.00 dollars but I did see that their baked pastas are extremely pricey, $16.99 for pasta?! Um thanks but no thanks!

This will be my go to spot for chicken wings!!

^__^"}
{"text":"The pizza here is awesome!  The other food is pretty good too, but I'm not a fan of the french fries.  My family orders from Napoli's from time to time because it is so close to them, so I've tried a lot of stuff on the menu.

The pizza is the best, so get that the first time you go.  If you're looking at the rest of the menu, I'd suggest the pastas, especially the tortellini.  The garlic breadsticks are delicious and buttery.  Their side salads are kind of lame, but the Caprese and Caesars are good.    

I disagree that the people that work here are mean.  They are always very busy and in a hurry, so they aren't taking the time to smile and ask you how your day is going.  I'm not sure where they are from, but I think they are Eastern European; therefore, they act a little different.  I think Americans are used to the super-friendly attitude of people trying to get you to come back to their business.  But at Napoli's they are all business; it's very in-and-out and I personally like it that way.

FYI, wait times are going to be longer if you don't live close to them...just because you are in Henderson doesn't mean it will be quick.  It can take 20 minutes just to drive from Napoli's to downtown Henderson, plus the cooking time."}
{"text":"I can't rate the food because it was never delivered after 2 hours of being told \"15 more mins\".   After being hung up on about 8 times, we were able to finally tell someone we weren't going to wait another 15 mins. I understand they were busy but they should have stopped taking orders they obviously couldn't handle instead of making families with young kids starve because of their mismanagement."}
{"text":"The last two times we have ordered Napolis has been a failure. We would at least order from them biweekly. The pizza has gotten so greasy that you can't pick up a slice without the toppings sliding off. Also the pick up special is almost $10 for a pizza that is roughly 10-12 inches. Yikes."}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying if you're looking to get the most pizza for the least amount of money, this is your place. I ordered the lunch special #8 which was two slices and a free drink. They brought me out a medium pizza cut in half. So much grease on the pizza I had to dab it off and there was still tons left. So greasy it upset my stomach 20min after I left. Customer service is decent, flavor of the pizza was ok...not the best. You for sure get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I hate to do this but for the last few times we have ordered it has looked like a retarded child has prepared our food. I love the time we ordered a pepperoni pizza and it only had like 5 pepperonis on it."}
{"text":"I ordered a bacon cheese burger... Meat was tasty but fries wur kinda stale n dry coulda been better... But other then that it was ok..."}
{"text":"Oh, Scotty don't!!! Okay, I'll start with the good. Delivery arrived exactly when they said.....

Okay, now the bad. 
Umm, since when does a cold sandwich come looking like a fucking chefs salad. Almost no roast beef. But at least an entire head of lettuce, at least one full tomato barely sliced into fourths, a whole red onion with the goddamn skin and sprouts still on it. Then comes the Stromboli. I asked for a strom with only cheese, pep and salami, small one. It gets here, I tell the driver that I got charged for a large strom. He argues with me, I have the receipt in my hand. I then show him that it is filled with 6 other ingredients, he leaves. I call. They put a credit on my phone number for a future order. I'm never going to use this credit, so if anyone in the Henderson area wants to use my phone number for a $20.00 credit let me know. I'll only ask for $5.00 cash in return. They didn't even offer to make the correct order for me. Fucking bullshit."}
{"text":"..This is the second time we've tried  this place, walk in absolutely no customer service at all. They just stared at us like we were inconveniencing them so we walked out and it happen the time before. That's the last time we go."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Huge sizes available. Authentic taste. Fresh ingredients. Friendly staff. This place is always busy which tells me good things."}
{"text":"The pizza is good, not gonna lie but thr service is nasty!

The first time we ordered delivery, the food was cold and the driver was so nasty, real attitude problem, 
I still handed him his tip and as soon as I did, he changed

All along he thought we were not giving him a tip

The pizza was cold and it had like these little peieces of fiber,  the garlic knots burned and inedible, 

We are never ordering from here again, so sorry"}
{"text":"I want so badly to give this place 5 stars, but to be honest, it was more like a 3.5 for me than a 4 star. I bumped it up because the pizza is just so dang good. I stopped here during my hour lunch break. I ordered a white pizza with tomatoes and garlic and breaded cauliflower. The pizza took a little while longer to come out than I expected and I was worried I would have to scarf it down. When it finally did arrive, I was not disappointed! The crust was on the thinner side with a slight crunch to the bottom. The top crust was  softer and flavorful. They did not skimp on the toppings and the pizza was nice and hot to taste.

The breaded cauliflower was some of the best I've ever tasted. Call me dramatic (how good can a breaded cali be?!), but it tasted so good to me- crispy on the outside and the cauli was not soggy inside. The breading itself was the perfect thickness and kind of textured like a crispier hushpuppy on the outside--not greasy at all. I received such a generous portion size, that I was almost full from those before the pizza came out. 

I do wish that their online menu was updated. I called the restaurant the other day to inquire about an online menu and the girl told me they have a website, \"but it hasn't been updated in a really long time\". She told me they have menus in the store, if needed. If I were them, living in 2016 I think it would just be more convenient to just update the online one. The inside of the restaurant is pretty clean. Although, I find the posted menu difficult hard to read. It's on a chalkboard and on several different walls. The place could definitely use some updating, but trust me when I say this is the best pizza Monroeville has to offer. Prices are decent for the amount that you receive. I'm not sure if they deliver or not, but even if they don't, it's worth the drive to pick it up!"}
{"text":"I have ordered pizzas from here several times and I have yet to be disappointed. I like the giant 30\" for parties! It tastes great and can feed everyone. It's not a bad deal either. I'm not a huge fan of chain pizza places so I'm glad I found Napoli. They have good food and decent prices and offer dine in, take out as well as delivery. Tonight we are getting a medium pineapple and bacon, medium pepperoni, and a side order of French fries. My mouth is watering waiting for it to be ready. Definitely would recommend this place to my friends and family. Go try it out!"}
{"text":"Great food, especially the pizza! This is a favorite for meetings and working weekends!"}
{"text":"They are horribly inconsistent. I have had good experiences there before but the last 2 have been absolutely horrible. Ordered their wings when we received them they were so overcooked you couldn't eat them and they shorted us a fry. We called to speak to a manager and were met with rude staff. Per manager we had to actually come in the next day and bring the wings and receipt in as if we were lying.When i arrived and asked for the manager they told us he would be right out. They lady never went and told him anything for quite awhile. I asked her again and her response was she was so busy she couldnt deal with everything at once. We finally spoke to the manager and asked to have our ordered delivered because my brother in law had placed a seperate order and he had already received his food because i had to wait so long to speak to the manager. Our fix it order took over 2 hours to get to us and the food was cold and disgusting and the calzone was burnt to a crisp. Yes cold burnt food. I will NOT be wasting anymore money at this establishment. Such a shame food quality and customer service just doesn't exist anymore at some of these so called restaurants."}
{"text":"The pizza here is awesome. I've never been there to eat, only had delivery. Usually their delivery is timely, but today they quoted me an hour and it showed up an hour and fifteen minutes, and cold."}
{"text":"Quick, clean, affordable, fresh, delicious, and great lunch specials, too. First timer-had the two slices w any two toppings made fresh (and quick-about 7 min wait total) and a drink for $5.99. Pizza slices are huge and the crust is thin, extremely crispy, and the sauce was wonderful. I got fresh tomatoes and onions and I'd do it again. I noticed they do offer a few vegetarian options and gluten-free crust too. The kind of thin and crispy that's not so heavy on greasy cheese you feel like you're eating a quesadilla... Honestly very good. Service was right on, too. My friend got a blackened chicken salad and well... I'm staring at her empty plate. They're open late and a great spot so I'd say give em a try."}
{"text":"My wife ordered a pizza from Napali at 5:30 in the evening at around 630 we called to inquire where the pizza was. Getting a very rude response from the manager they took our order once again as if we never placed the order. We were delivered a pizza 30 minutes later. My wife had ordered a large half pepperoni, what we received was a large whole pepperoni that someone decided it was OK to pick half the pepperoni off one side and throw it on the other side. This is a cardinal sin in food preparation you do not touch someone's food after it's been out of the oven. We proceeded to call the manager, after he was so unfriendly the first time I didn't expect a whole lot of customer service but I did not expect the nastiness and the combativeness. He requested I take a picture of the pizza and send it to them to verify my claim, thank goodness he asked me to do that so I can post these pictures now. I was told the manager would be in touch with me tomorrow and that they would send me a pizza to replace the mistake. I did not feel comfortable and consuming any food products from a place that thought it was acceptable to pick their fingers through my food before delivering it to me,I declined. I then proceeded to return to the store to receive a refund which I was not offered. I returned the pizza to the person that I spoke to on the phone he went to the back and after waiting an inordinate  amount of time, I began to question what is going on.I had to actually raise my voice and demand my money back before somebody came out and tried to give me five dollars less than I paid for the pizza as you can imagine I will never set foot in Napoli Pizza anywhere in this town."}
{"text":"Used to go here a lot during school for the lunch specials. It was OK but went downhill fast. Had to wait forever for a sandwich even though there was one other person eating there. Turns out they never put the order in. I finally got my philly cheese steak the steak was burnt to hell and no cheese was on it. The ladies behind the counter aren't too helpful. It's very rare they look up from their cell phones to help a customer. When you finally do get their attention they pull an attitude if you ask for something. After 3 or more bad experiences here I gave up on them. I put my money to better use elsewhere. If you want a similar menu but better food & service check out sunset pizzeria."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but there is a lot of room for improvement. I've lived in Henderson and worked in restaurants for 20 years & started out in family owned pizza places in Henderson. So I know that there's no acceptable reason for it to take 25 minutes to make one sandwich, or 40 minutes to make one pizza. I've ordered delivery from here a small handful of times over the course of many years when they were close to GVHS. I recall the food taking a really long time to arrive, the food was disappointing and we ordered a huge pizza and the middle of the pizza was raw and soggy.  I recently decided I would try again, thought it would be better since I'd heard good things from other people and it had been so many years. I ordered a sandwich for pick up and was quoted 25 minutes. It was dead as a doornail when I got there & I did not see a justifiable reason for a sandwich to take 25 minutes.  Maybe there was a lot of deliveries but doubtful, it it was a weekday and it wasn't lunch or dinner time. There was two tables in a restaurant that had already been served their food.. The gentleman behind the counter was extremely friendly and made me feel as though I was in an authentic Italian restaurant which I liked. The restaurant inside and the patio is beautiful! Really nice! The pizza being served in the dining room looked really good. I'd like to come back and dine in with my family or maybe get a pizza sometime soon. When I got home and opened the box I thought I got the wrong order because it looked like some kind of beef sandwich, I ordered a chicken parm. It looked dark because the sauce was brown and didn't resemble a tomato based sauce. It was thick like a paste, sweet and burnt and bitter tasting as if it had been over reduced or possibly cooked repeatedly and or refrigerated repeatedly.  Despite this I still gave them another try and ordered pizza for pick up and I'm told it'll take 40 minutes. I said no thank you. Some places have a reputation for taking a long time but usually those places busy and worth the wait bc they are consistent. If we were to dine in, would it take 40 minutes for the order to reach the table? That would be unacceptable. We will see because I would really like to try the pizza so I probably will but I will give myself plenty of time."}
{"text":"I've had Napoli's pizza all throughout my childhood and I still love it so much. Their pizza is so different compared to other pizza places in Monroeville. I love the thick dough it's so soft on the inside with just enough crunchiness of the crust on the outside; oh and they use the perfect amount of cheese/sauce/toppings. I love their plain or pepperoni pizza the best."}
{"text":"This was my first time napolis and obviously we came here for the pizza since it is a pizzeria but holy smokes the chicken wings with garlic and Parmesan cheese is sooooo good!

I was expecting the ladies at the counter to be rude (because this is what a lot of the reviews mentioned) but we had a really nice lady who was very patient with us since this was our first time and we were looking over the menu!

I highly suggest to look at the specials because without it, the food can get kind of pricey. I would also suggest to order ahead of time for pick up because the wait was pretty long (I was starving so the time went by like molasses lol). The wait was 20-30 minutes.

So with that being said, the pepperoni pizza was mediocre but the wings were fiiiiiire."}
{"text":"Pizza is good. And so are prices. Usually everyone is pretty nice except the busser (I'm guessing) tonight she was scooting a trash can across the floor through a busy restaurant like a bus tub?!. GROSS, and nearly ran me over with it and didn't say excuse me."}
{"text":"Delivery driver makes it in about 30-45 mins but gives me the wrong pizza. I asked the driver in person, \"Could you add ranch to my order?\". He said yes. He comes back about 30-45 mins later with a room temperature/cold pizza and the plates, napkins and even the pizza box smelling like stale cigarette smoke. I call to inform them of the issue. The manager was helpful but only offered another pizza or $5 off my next.  It's late and I'm frustrated. I've had issues with the quality of the pizza before. I will give Napoli's one last try."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and when people say some place has good pizza in Vegas I hesitate 
because a lot of people don't know what good pizza is. With that being said, Sunset has great NY/Chicago style pizza at a fair price. Also my martinis are only 6:50 with ketel one (not to sweet) and I also enjoy  the great atmosphere."}
{"text":"u guys write some funny reviews.lol.I love this place.The have sum very good pizza.Me n my ex use to order here every week.16\" pepperoni, tereyaki wings(20)and and a order of fries.Always the same price 23.89.Not bad to feed a family.You also get a free 2-liter.As far as the service,lol,at times when i came in to order,they did seem like they hate life.But most of the time,they were cool.Think their from Europe or sumthin....but they make sum pretty good food.havent tried anything else on the menu,but i look forward to ordering that 30\" pizza.You can get a 30\" 1 topping w/half bucket of wings or fingers and a 2-liter for 42.99.i suggest this place if u like pizza. HOWEVER, CUGINO'S ITALIAN DELI IS STILL THE BEST"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza that I've ever had! Service is a little slow if ordering to go but it's defiantly worth the wait! It's also very affordable! I'll be returning when I have a craving for pizza!"}
{"text":"What a joke.  Ordered  $50 worth of Pizza and wings. Got 1oz of Ranch and a attitude from 2 delivery drivers.  Tried them 4 years ago thought I would give them another try. Dont....not worth it. Worthless tasteless food. Customer service pointless.  Bye Felicia"}
{"text":"I love this pizza parlor! I come here at least once to twice a week. First time I ever had anything come close to ninja turtle pizza... cheesy and stringy from every bite. Take your good company and have a great time! My favorite pizza spot in all of Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"My family has been ordering from this Napoli's for three years.  The food is great and we have tolerated wrong orders (many times), loss of orders, late delivery, and tonight...by mistake... the driver was given substantially more $ than the order cost.  We contacted the store only of course for the delivery guy to deny our claim, then for the manager to proceed to say he wasnt going to take sides???   If anything I expected them to be honest or in the very least look into it.  Very disappointed.  My mistake not double checking the $ and worse...for thinking the guy would be honest.  One of my major pet peeves is dishonesty and I won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"The hotel I was staying in recommended this place. After an exauhsting day of moving I was very hungry and tired and pizza sounded great. I called and ordered just a pepperoni pizza. No big deal, right. I was told about 30-45 minutes. I waited for 90 minutes and still NO PIZZA! I called and like a previous post said, was put on hold for over 10 minutes. They finally came on the phone and simply stated the guy was on his way. Another 30 minutes and still no pizza. I went up to the lobby to see if there was another place I could call for some food as I was falling asleep waiting. As I was waiting to talk to the desk person the pizza guy walks in! Mind you this is over 2 hours after I ordered. He asks my name and hands me the receipt to sign and the pizza. The box didn't feel even warm, so I opened it and sure enough it was cold. I complained to him and he could have cared less. Needless to say, I didn't tip very much. I took my cold pizza back to my room and ate it cold as I was too tired to fight this place.
BEWARE. They are rude and have no customer service whatsoever. If you don't mind waiting forever for a cold pizza, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Don't order your food online... They will forget your order or put it on HOLD until you call to see where it is.. Then we went to pick up food.. They had no care for the troubles we went through.. We are now 3 hours into waiting for our order.. Terrible customer service.. Tell everyone you know. I'm still waiting for my food!!"}
{"text":"I ordered food for delivery from this place. First, the order took 25 minutes over the quoted time. When I called to get an update on my food I was hung up on. I called back, someone answered and quickly mumbled something and put me straight on hold. After finally talking to someone I was told it would be just a few more minutes for my food. Once my food arrived I opened it to see almost everything was wrong. I ordered a medium rare bacon cheeseburger lettuce wrapped with jalapeños. I received very dry meat wrapped in a tortilla with lettuce and jalapeños. There was no cheese or bacon. I ordered wings and was asked if I wanted ranch or blue cheese. Neither came with the order. I was so turned off by the food that I threw it away. Unfortunately, it was too late to call another place because most places were closed. This place has terrible food and terrible customer service. Don't waste your money"}
{"text":"2nd time we have ordered delivery and it has been over two hours and still waiting. My wife was on hold with them for 30 minuets to be told sorry very busy. I'm sick of this place treating people like this it's time to seek legal action if possible. Hopefully this review will help people too please be ware of this restaurant.this place is ridiculous."}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone says about this place.... I love the pizza and everything else I've had there. There is a few dollars extra for delivery because I'm a bit far from the place but it's worth every penny! By the way I once fed an entire bachelorette party with the largest pizza they make."}
{"text":"Horrible service...placed my order at 4:46, they said 25 minutes it is now 5:26 and I'm still waiting. There are 4 - 5 girls at a time just standing around, really? Maybe if you stopped flirting and got to work I'd be out of here already. 

Mind you I only ordered a 16\" pizza and garlic balls."}
{"text":"Thank you Napoli Pizza!!! After being a new resident to Monroeville and trying 4 different pizza places and being let down I finally came across Napolis.  Awesome pizza awesome pasta. Now the only place I order from. Delivered to me in 30 minutes. Everything was great!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the pizza and special pick up price is great, but they need to work on their Empowerment, aka their front line workers. 

This is the second week in a row that the front staff looks annoyed, bored and irritated. 

A customer should never have to say \"Hello\" first to the worker, when you have been waiting at the counter."}
{"text":"They have very good food, nice portions, and decent prices. If I'm near by, this is my go to."}
{"text":"Pizza is good ,  chicken wings are excellent and they have the free style coke machine with free refills . Great cannolis .

Excellent hours and it's nice to go someplace in the neighborhood that's open to 3 or 4 am ."}
{"text":"Used to be the best now I don't know what's going on over there. Haven't been on time the last three times. An hour estimation and they get here in 30 minutes now an hour estimation and they're a half an hour to an hour late every time, WTF?!?"}
{"text":"Ever hear the saying, \"Attitude makes a difference?\" Well, this place has got some, and its not a good type.

You want customer service? If you want an owner who does bookkeeping on the counter while the waitresses/girls behind counter are running around, then hey, that's great. These girls were busting their asses, while the clowns were just standing around. Nice. No one asked, can I help you? How is everything...nothing. There must have been 10-15 guys that came in and made a beeline towards the back. Not one of them said hello, how ya doin', NOTHING. I almost walked out just because of the negativity these guys were giving off. Sorry, if that's the way you are gonna run your biz, then I'm never coming back. 

Food: burnt on the bottom of the pizza. Really? You are going to burn PIZZA?? Not only are these guys not Italian, they can't even make a pizza? Wtf? 
So basically for my Friday night, I got some: bad attitude, bad 'aura', burnt pizza."}
{"text":"The first time we ordered delivery was the night of the Mayweather/Mcgregor fight, so the fact that they lied to us repeatedly about it being on the way for nearly 2 hours could be forgiven due to the fact that all of 702 was ordering takeout. We never did receive it and got refunded. Fine. 
Tonight we ordered one large veggie pizza and poppers. We were told it'd be delivered in an hour and 10 minutes , and it was. Cold. 
Now that I've had a chance to eat their food (after we heated it up a bit) I can honestly say I don't know how they're even in business. This has to be the worst pizza I've ever had. Chewy and slimy crust, zero flavor, probably because there is so little pizza sauce. My toddler took one bite and handed it back. Seriously, if you can't make a 3 year old pizza monster like your product you're doing something wrong. 
This meal cost us $42 after tip. We threw it in the trash and made microwave dinners."}
{"text":"I had a hard time deciding on how many stars to give cuz my family, friends & I love the pizza from here....my dilemma comes from the customer service. I work very close by & on most occasions someone else picks up the order. Some of the younger people that have gone to get our order always say the customer service is HORRIBLE. I have a feeling it may be because they aren't tipping to the staffs liking. However, like a previous reviewer stated, the wait time can be out of control. I had called an hour & 40 min ahead of time for 1 of the 36\" pizza, which we get a lot. We usually get 4 different quarters on the pizza. The last time it was ALL wrong & the pick up person waited an additional 25 min for the pizza. I will still get pizza for home, on occasion but where I work, well, everyone refuses to go pick up our order."}
{"text":"Monday night I ordered a pizza, it took so long to get to me that I fell asleep. Now this is totally on me, no blame on the restaurant on that but when I called to see if there was anyway to get a refund or maybe a replacement (I had to try, I didn't want to be out $20) the manager was so incredibly rude and basically accused me of being a liar. He said he could tell from the time the order was dispatched that it arrived in an appropriate time of 30 mins. I told him that I ordered the pizza at 1:51am (which he confirmed) and the first call from the driver was at 3:00am. He told me that is not possible because the store is closed at 3. I said but it is possible and it happened- I have the records ON MY PHONE! He continued to tell me I was wrong and finally said he would offer me a measly 10% on a future order. I told him no, that was ridiculous and he should keep in mind that this was my first and will be my last experience with their company. He then said he would speak to the night manager at 5pm to see what happened and call me back. Do you think I got a callback? Of course not. Again my beef is with the rude manager not the fact that I fell asleep. That is totally on me. This situation could have been handled so much better. Harry if you read this- here is a script for next time: \"I am so sorry that happened to you. Unfortunately we cannot offer a refund or a replacement but I can give you 10% off if you would like to place a new order.\""}
{"text":"This may be one of the worst pizzas we had. We ordered a small anti pasto salad, the 24 inch, 5 sodas and 5 bottles of water... $61 and nothing but soggy greasy pizza. Save your dough...lol pun intended."}
{"text":"We ordered dinner delivery from here last night. After a long weekend something yummy and easy was exactly what we wanted but unfortunately didn't get. Since we were craving lasagna, i searched Yelp for an Italian delivery place and found Napoli's. I followed the yelp link to the menu on their website and under hot specialties with the rest of the dinners found Lasagna. There were two options, 1 for a 1/2 pan and 1 for a full pan...perfect! Loving the convenience of yelp I also decided to place our order through the Eat 24 ordering link listed on this listing. Easy enough. 1.5 hours later the delivery man showed up. (I called at the 55 min mark and was assured that the driver was on his way). Well 40 min after that when he did show up, he brought 1 tiny container of Lasagna (enough for a child's portion) and our Garlic bread. Now starving and super disappointed, I called Napoli's to inquire about where the rest of our lasagna was. She informed me that this option was the only one available and if I wanted something special than I should have called to order. I nicely explained to her that the 1/2 pan lasagna was clearly listed on the menu through the yelp link and she abruptly told me that she has no clue what I'm talking about that menu is wrong. So just to recap, The menu linked in this Yelp page is incorrect and they don't want us to use the Eat 24 app that they've chosen to link as well. Making the best out if the situation, my fam started eating while I was on the phone, sharing the one person serving of lasagna. IT WAS COLD!! Like ice cold and cheese hardened and the garlic bread was as hard as a rock. WHAAt?! I can understand if it takes extra time to cook a lasagna, but an 1.5hrs and rude service for 3 bites of COLD dinner that cost about $25?! Sorry Napoli's, this was just bad all around."}
{"text":"\"I always come here when I want the good old fashioned, New York style, pepperoni & cheese pizza!\" The wings are delicious too!"}
{"text":"I liked the food here. Greasy pizza which I don't prefer, but some might, but it tasted good and had a good amount of toppings. The crispy chicken salad was tasty. Had your typical quartered tomato, and my only complaint is: only 4 olives!!?? I love olives and for such a large salad, they could have spared a few more olives. 
Mozzarella sticks were great. I would probably return here and recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in town! This place is consistently delicious and always fresh! The staff is okay and the dining room is darling! On time delivery and fantasti my cheesy!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome. As someone who doesn't eat meat or dairy, they make an awesome no cheese, vegetarian pizza. My meat eating friends even love it. I have never ordered anything there that wasn't made perfectly. 

The down side... Delivery can be slow and they're pretty rude on the phone. 

Overall, Napolis reminds me of a very good doctor who has bad bedside manner. They annoy me a little but do such a good job."}
{"text":"I never noticed this place and drove in the area plenty of times. It's by Sears on warm springs. My boyfriend showed me it. I love there pizza. Big slices. Lots of cheese. I always get the pick up special which is a 16inch pizza one topping. It's the kind of pizza you can fold like a taco. The sauce is sweet. Yummy every time. Additional toppings are $1.75. They even have a 30 inch. 

Being that I like the pizza I decided to order lasagna $16.99... Not knowing I ordered anyways. It was ok. Honestly I feel it was overpriced. I would rather go Olive Garden for that price. 

I always order take out because service isn't very great. They have 4 t.v's inside. They do have beer and wine. Also outside seating with ceiling fans. 

I also love that there open late. 
Sun-wed 9am to 3am...
Thursday 9am to 4am
Fri-sat     9am to 5am"}
{"text":"My hubby and I decided to try this place, as we were getting tired of the more popular pizza chain restaurants. We stopped in at this place on a Thursday around 5 pm and it was not busy at all. The employees were nice and helpful, and we got our order in a decent amount of time.

We ordered a simple pepperoni pizza and some garlic balls. The garlic balls were HUGE, and we got a dozen for around $3. The first batch came out burnt so we had to request them to be remade. The second batch came out well, and were pretty good tasting too. The pizza tasted amazing as well, but it was EXTREMELY greasy. Now I know pizza is normally greasy and I should stop being a pansy, but this pizza was OVERLY greasy. Like, oh my God greasy. Still, it was delicious."}
{"text":"Love Napoli Pizza! Order from them often, never disappointed..   They even have real blue cheese with chunks, Yummy!  Would recommend them to everyone!"}
{"text":"Love this place, I love wings and they have them. I ordered 20 medium well done, 10 mild, and 10 garlic parm. My financé loves the garlic parm, it's his fav. I love the medium, hot is too hot for me. Fries are yummy. When I order delivery, my food is always hot and ready to eat. The ranch sometimes is good and other times watery. Always Plan to wait, it's always busy. I have also ordered a meat lovers pizza, no pizza hut fake pizza here. Huge slices, lots of meat, lots of cheese, with a bit of grease,"}
{"text":"I come every weekend with the family .... Have never had a problem  with the service  and the pizza has always been very good ."}
{"text":"After I saw comercial of the Napoli pizza, my husband and I decided to visit this pizza place for ordering pizza. While we were waiting , we found chicken marsala on the menu, I ordered it and my husband ordered chicken piccada. The result were the DISASTER!  Worst thing was the price was more than $36 for two for the poorest quality chicken ever. We should have returned the dishes right away, but we were not ready to hurt somebody's feeling whoever so-called chef in the kitchen..
I've never had and even seen that soupy, oily marsala before. We were in awe-struck and stunned by the shock. We couldn't eat those, anyhow we didn't put it on complaint  that day. But whenever it comes to my mind, i feel like i have to write a right review for others like us. But the pizza was not bad, actually it was more than average. It was the Nightmare chicken!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is fantastic, especially their white pizza!! The food is always hot when delivered,  and it's so delicious!  The cashiers are friendly when you pick the pizza up, and the chefs, especially vinnie, are fantastic.  It's rare to get a pizza that needs more cheese, but it does happen. They're definitely a bit more pricey, and they don't accept or have coupons which really sucks, however,  they do use quality ingredients.  Their dough is freshly made daily. The kitchen is clean, and they definitely keep it that way. I worked here as a teenager, and believe me when I say they're strict on sanitation."}
{"text":"Love the sauce and seasoning and the pepperoni is the best, one of my fav pizza joints!!"}
{"text":"This is the closest to a New York style pizza I have been able to find since moving to Vegas and I am absolutely in LOVE. Everything I've tried from their menu so far is awesome! I also love how ridiculous some of their pizza sizes are. I got the 24 inch pizza once and it's HUGE and that's not even their biggest size! 

This place is great for groups and lots to share! Garlic knots are amazing as well! They have a super speedy delivery and really easy to order online and pick. 

The food is great AND they're convenient: making this place perfect in my opinion.

My only comment is as a New Yorker, I always ask for the pizza to be well done so that I can get that crispy crust I love so much."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! We came in with about 12 people and they took great care of us! 
Huge salads, amazing sandwiches and delicious pizza! The sauce was so good.
I wish this place was by my house!"}

{"text":"I personally love the hours, love the variety of drink option (love the green tea), and love the fries. I always find myself here at 2 am cause it's a good place that is actually open late in Henderson that isn't McDonald's or a Taco Bell. 

I think the customer service is great too, never had a bad experience and everything comes out on time."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time until the guy at the front counter started being rude. Honestly, we used to come because of the big pizza, but it's not worth the bad customer service. Either way, the pizza is extremely greasy, but it is edible. Won't be coming back though, after several bad experiences."}
{"text":"Fave a 4 star just because of the service. The food is good but the service is horrible. I haven't been here in months because I refuse to give my money to people who think it's ok to not smile and say hello to their guests."}
{"text":"I will not be a customer again at this pizza place. I placed an order, the girl said it'd be about an hour and nearly 2 hours passed. And my pizza wasn't here, so I called them. And one of the girls said she didn't have an order of mine. So I asked to speak to Terry the manager, and he said the same thing, didn't even have the courtesy of saying sorry for the inconvenience or anything, was very rude and ignoring the issue. I know how food places work, restaurants, etc. Customer is always right. The manager clearly needs to learn that, and educate his workers."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken triple decker, cheese cake and a lemonade. This review would be 5 stars because the sandwich was great and so was the cheese. The few problems were that the bread was pretty burnt, and it wasn't cut so that made it a bit hard to eat, the lemonade was super sweet and It was a pretty long wait so I'll just order sooner next time but other then those things it was good."}
{"text":"My husband and I have always gone to this place since we have lived here. It's our go to pizza place. The food is always on point and the prices are reasonable. One thing we are not a fan of is the not so friendly staff. On this particular occasion I had ordered food and had it delivered for my husbands birthday for a very large group of people. You'd think if someone is spending $250 you would at least try to be somewhat pleasant. Fortunately for Napolis their wings are yummy so we will be back."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza, wings and fries for pick up. Young lady who took the order was a bit confused but it got taken and I was quoted 30 minutes. I showed up right at 30 minutes...paid and was told my order should be ready in 2 minutes.  

15 minutes later I asked how much longer for my order. Young lady said she would look into it. About 4 minutes later the young man who I paid comes and and says \"there was a mix up, your order will be ready in 10 min max\" 

15 minutes later....young girl comes out hands me the food and says here you go.  No apology, no explanation, nothing offered. 

Fries and wings were tasty (and cooked well done as asked), pizza was cold. I'm guessing they made the pie but forgot the rest so the pizza sat until it was all ready. 

I used to be a fan...won't come again...customer service is just too easy. I'd easily overlook mistakes with at least an apology."}
{"text":"I ordered from GrubHub as a delivery. It came to the time that GrubHub said it was suppose to have it delivered and no pizza, so I called them. The girl that answered the phone didn't want to talk to me since she seemed angry for anything I asked. She then tells me they just saw my order and it's going to be over an hour. It's been over 2 and a half hours since I ordered at this point so I called to check on it again. The same girl answered with the same attitude like shes inconvenience by my questions. And again, she doesn't know about my order. I can't judge the food because I don't know if I'm even getting food at this point but the customer service is absolute garbage."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I ordered lunch from here and didn't have a great experience. The manager took the order and he wasn't very friendly. We ordered off the lunch special menu. We got a blt combo that came with 2 end pieces of bread (which I think is weird) and not a lot of bacon, chicken fingers and fries (which I had and were good) and the 2 slices of cheese pizza special. When the delivery driver dropped the order off he forgot to drop off the pizza. It took him about 20 minutes to circle back around. They gave us the 2 slices and drink on the house. I called to complain about the blt and the manager basically said it is what it is.  On their pamphlet it also mentions there is a $1.50 delivery fee but I was charged $4.50 because we were out of their range, hich I understand but they might want to add that disclaimer on their handout menu. They also do a $1.00 credit card fee. Most likely will not be ordering from them again. Only reason I'm giving them a 2 star is because I used to go to their Sahara location and always enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The chicken parmigiana sub was okay. It would have been delicious if it was on a better quality piece of bread like a nice  crusty bread. The bread was to soft and mushy and fell apart while eating. They have an extensive menu and will try some other menu items that don't include bread. Check out their menu, they have great lunch specials. The pizza is pretty good."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!! I just got my deliver it is Delicious!!!
I ordered the Napoli cheese burger,garlic knots, mild hot wings and carrot cake .
Everything is Delicious the burger is fantastic the burger was cooked to perfection . You've got a regular customer coming your way often !"}
{"text":"If you want a great deal subscribe to their text specials! A large one topping pizza and large antipasto salad for $14.99 was this weeks special. The food is always delicious!"}
{"text":"The pizza is DELISH! Wings are to die for, either boneless or bone-in (I prefer bone-in) with 12 different sauces to try! I'm told petrolatum is a combo of BBQ & teriyaki - gotta give it a go next time! Casual atmosphere with friendly staff, great with suggestions for first-time goers!"}
{"text":"Omg! We ordered the XLarge and my oh my, it was one of the largest pizzas I've ever eaten (even coming from a hubs born and raised in NY).  It was so delicious and they made it just how we like it, extra crispy and not too greasy!  

Minor issues, I'm a Cali girl who loves ranch on their pizza-- didn't like the $1.00 extra for such a small sample of it.  They also forgot our marinara sauce with our breaded mushroom order and we asked to sub it with more ranch, but it didn't happen.  

All in all, great, delicious, authentic Italian tasting pizza!  Every time we're in Vegas and visiting family, this will definitely be a new family tradition, just get your ranch game up, lol! Thanks, Napoli!"}
{"text":"Attempting  to  cut through  the  shoe leather crust as I  am writing  this .  This pizza is quite  expensive  considering how  much  you  can't  eat due  to the burnt crust.  Absolutely  the most disgusting  pizza we have  ever ordered."}
{"text":"Great food but no matter when I order hr and half to hr 45 for delivery first time I ordered it was two hours before I got my food and I live less then 5 miles away don't offer delivery if it takes you double to triple the time to deliver the food then it does to cook it"}
{"text":"Found this pizza place after a night of partying they were the only ones open so i gave them a shot. Best decision its amazing Ive searched everywhere for any competition but nothing compares, classic delicious pizza, wings are flavorful!  love the specials too."}
{"text":"The spaghetti and meatballs was okay, not great, certainly not worth the 40 minute wait."}
{"text":"Gross ... what happened to this place 
Used to come here all the time ... won't ever again 
Asked for well done and it was soggier than a sponge. 
Sauce and cheese tasted cheap 
Sticking with sals pizza 
What a waste of time and money"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. 

Me and coworkers split the same meal today around 3. 

By 8 we have all been sick. Throwing up, stomachs pains and sweating profusely. 

I called and spoke with the not so polite manager \"Harry\" whom stated that there is no way we are sick from his food. Harry said \"I know the food I put out, getting sick from food takes at least 24 hours to happen.\" 

We did not argue at first just asked for a refund as we obviously did not enjoy our food and felt ill. 

He said he would not refund us as he knows his food is good and then disconnected the call.

Worst food and service I have had at a family owned business. I work in an office near this location and we order food often I will be sure to send a company email advising the over 100 on staff to not eat here, that the food was less than satisfactory and the customer service is horrendous."}
{"text":"First time customer who lives near by. Thought I'd give this place a shot since I like to support local businesses.  Ordered just a basic cheese pizza and it hardly had any sauce on it.  Was very dry.  Not sure if I'll come back."}
{"text":"The biggest loss here was the staff. Absolutely rude and uninterested in helping. Their demeanor did not make it seem like they enjoyed their job too much. Besides that the pizza was tasty but super greasy. Make work for some people tho. My fiancé liked the garlic knots but they're not (no pun intended) the best I've had. Super Pizza has better knots. All-in-all the first impression is the staff and it alone makes me not want to come back."}
{"text":"This place would get five stars if it wasn't for the rude staff. The only time anybody has been nice to us is when they wanted us to vote for them for best pizzeria. Their food is amazing, my husband and I usually get the medium one topping pizza which is their pick up special for $7.99. The pizza here is very different than other places, unlike mainstream pizza joints it has an authentic Italian taste. You must order ahead of time, I recommend at least 30 minutes since they are always busy. I've never tried their delivery service, but their pickup orders are always ready in about 20-30 minutes. Their wings and calzones are also very tasteful . They have great lunch specials, but if you have limited time to eat lunch I wouldn't recommend coming here. If the staff was more friendly and helpful this place would definitely be a five star!"}
{"text":"I've ordered the inhouse medium 16 inch pepperoni pizza pick up yourself special twice in the last 3 months, it's a deal for $7.99!
The pizza is huge! for a medium and the sauce is very close to perfection as can be, good quality mozzarella cheese that doesn't make you want to drink up all of Lake Mead to quench your thrist afterwards like some other salty cheeses used in lower grade pizza joints. The crust is perfect in my opinion, not too phonebook thick, not too potato chip crust thin. Even the pepperoni is extra good and does not have that purina dog food taste like I have experienced with other pizza chains. I've only tried the pizza here and not anything else, but looking at the menu makes you wonder how they can offer such an extensive line up of Pizza, Italian food items, wings and other bar type fare? Somehow they seem to manage it. Service here is very good and I have not had any issues with the ladies behind the counter. The inside of the restaurant is plain and simple, with plenty of inside seating and even a small outside area that you can dine in. Beer, soft drinks and even a massive 30 inch pizza is offered here. There are big screen TVs on the wall so maybe sunday morning or monday night football games can be enjoyed here?
Good tasty pizza and will go out on a limb and say it's got to be right up there in my top three pizza choices in the Las Vegas valley, they got the pizza technique and recipe down.
Hot pizza right out of the Napoli oven or cold leftover pizza NOT heated, but taken right out of the fridge the next day, they pass the taste test every time!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with a bunch of friends one night. Really awesome for groups of friends! I had the wings and they were nice and hot =D Would like to patronize again."}
{"text":"Usually I just stopped and bought the pizza. My sixth visit beforehand checking online their menu, stopped by to order 1/2 fried chicken,  1/2 ribs and the today special 1 topping pizza. After a long wait, surprisingly they do not have any of those I ordered. Seriously? I am not blind, I found those on the menu just few minutes before and had no time  to argue and   do the business with this place anymore. Better you clarify your menu online or train your staff about menu knowledge."}
{"text":"What a shame. I have been a customer for 10 years. I had to repeat my address on the phone 4 times. I have always been in the system. Just ordered 3 months ago. They still called me back 3 times to verify the address. The food was cold. The garlic balls? Awful. Just tasted like dough. The pizza? Even worse. I will never go back again. For what I paid for my food. Would have rather gone to MacDonalds!"}
{"text":"Ordered a deep dish 4 topping combo.  All veggies and all delicious.  The sauce was tasty, the crust just right and the cheese had the perfect balance of gooeyness.  I am definitely a repeat a customer"}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I had late night stomach pangs and we decided, via the Eat24 app on my phone, that Napoli Pizza would be the one!  As some people may not be aware of, Napoli Pizza does do delivery. They charge you a fee of $2.50 but that's easy money and we were starving.

I wish I had read about this place before I blindly gave them a chance!
First of all Yelpers, why is it necessary to make a massively, overwhelmingly large menu?  Their menu is huge.  HUGE. 

They have:  20-something appetizers, at least 10-12 types of salads, 7 variations of soups, wings, boneless wings, 5 types of chicken dinners, ribs and rib platters (with sides), 20-something hot sandwiches, at least 7-8 cold sandwiches, 3-5 wraps, 1/2 and 1 pound burger platters (there are still like 7-9 types of different burgers!), a substantial handful of pasta and spaghetti entrees, BAKED pasta and spaghetti entrees, triple-decker sandwiches, veal dinners, lots of pizza types, a pretty solid children's menu and about 5-7 different dessert options.

I have never been so taken back by a menu.  Maybe this is new to me and not new to others, but this had me worried because I've worked in restaurants and seen too many Restaurant Impossible episodes!  There is NO WAY you'll be pumping out excellent food when you're having to make a dictionary sized amount at all times, 24/7. And you know what Yelpers?  There food really did come out some kinda' nasty.

~What we ordered: a ceasar salad, one of the appetizer combo platters, 12 piece medium wings, their garlic balls and one Philly steak sandwich.

To be fully honest, if I hadn't ordered the wings, I would have been giving them one star.  One star for 'they tried, but failed'.  My fears came true with ordering so late at night because the majority of all the food we received wasn't even warm anymore!  They actually took well over an hour and fifteen minutes and on my map, they are only 3 miles away from me.  Terrible!

The ceasar salad was NOT and will not ever be worth $8.  All they did really was put romaine lettuce in a to-go container, sprinkle stale (yes, it felt and tasted STALE) parmesan cheese all over the lettuce and sprinkle tiny bits of disgustingly old tasting croutons on top.  I mean, seriously, I could go out to Walmart and buy all of these ingredients myself but probably have it 1) come out tasting way better and 2) well, it sure as hell wouldn't be a friggin' $8 salad!

The boyfriend's Philly steak sandwich wasn't very good at all.  I've actually never eaten one before, so as the loving and curious individual (and partner) that I am, I took a bite.  I regretted it.  The bread felt hard and it actually tasted like it came out of a bag (again, Walmart anyone?).  The cheese wasn't fully melted, the meat was barely warm.  It was a mess. 

The garlic balls were by far the worst in my opinion!  They were pretty much inedible to me because they had put way too much parsley on it!  Literally, each garlic ball was green.  GREEN.  The red... \"sauce\", that came with them was overly spiced as well.  There was a huge bay leaf I just about ate that was sticking out of the tiny plastic container the sauce was in - I wigged out.  That really grossed me out considering whenever I cook, I pull those out well before I serve my food!  It's meant to add flavor, never be carelessly left in the food.  Gross.

Their sampler platter.  I was -so- disappointed.  I have a huge soft-spot in my heart for fried food (I come from the South!).  The onion rings and zucchini sticks were tasty but the fried mushrooms and jalapeno poppers were absolutely gross!  The friend mushrooms had a very sweet taste to them.  I took a bite of one and just about spit it out.  I've never had a friend mushroom before that tasted sugary.  Lo and behold, my boyfriend grabbed one and he had the same reaction.  The jalapeno poppers... ugh, the poppers.  Jalapeno poppers are a weakness of mine and these were totally botched.  The cheese was strange and had a grainy texture to it - the jalapeno tasted old and slimy.  Overall, this platter wasn't bad; go for a specific appetizer by them that other people like, don't waste your money.  I feel it was a waste of -my- money to get a sampler when half of it I actually didn't eat because it was horridly made.  

The medium-hot wings I chose to order are Napoli's saving grace, at least in my opinion.  The sauce was delicious, though I wish they had put more of a \"fry\" on the wings before drenching it all over them.  The meat was juicy, so I can't complain.  I really wouldn't say their wings blew me away, as I've had better.  Semi-satisfying wings really don't compensate for a poor job done, however!

All in all, I feel slightly jipped for my money and I won't be purchasing food from them again.  If you choose to, just beware and hope for the best.  It seems one person gets a fairly good experience while the other, in this case me, gets the bad end of the stick and you're stuck with sub-par food"}
{"text":"Food is edible and cheap. Cute girls always ready to take your order so why not. I've paid more for less so bring on the soggy pizza!"}
{"text":"So the 4 stars is mainly customer service and the food ! I keep ordering the capri salad and the first time around it had some dark glazed dressing on it and two times later, I've asked for it and haven't gotten it, it's a thicker glaze that just MAKES it ! I keep craving it too lol I'll continue ordering from here though cause the people are friendly and the food is great!"}
{"text":"Placed order over phone at 12:17pm. Told 25-30 minutes. Got there at 12:37pm. Guy told me the girl forgot about my order...Waited next to other customers who placed their orders before me. Order finally came through and I left Napoli's at 1:24pm. More than an HOUR from ordering to receiving food! Super disappointed and dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Alright, here's the deal: Napoli does late night pizza delivery with a pretty huge delivery area. I just moved across town and they delivered to both addresses. I'm also a night owl, and they're open so late it seems like they're open 24 hours. If you're in Henderson, and you're hungry at a ridiculous hour, Napoli probably has you covered.

They actually have a full Italian menu, but I've only ever ordered the pizza. My favorite? Canadian bacon, pineapple, white onion, mushroom. Ya, not a lot of folks can dig that when they hear it, but I assure you it's the ultimate pizza.

So how is their pizza? It's good. Much better than the big chains. Nothing fancy, but solid and satisfying. I'm half Italian and I grew up near Boston, so if you don't agree with my pizza taste, that's on you.

They're not super friendly on the phone but they're effective. After the first order they've always pulled up my info in a heartbeat. They always get the order right, and they've always been able to find my place, even behind gates and in the dark.

It's solid late night pizza. Delivered nearly anywhere in Henderson. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I'll make this short and sweet.  We ordered at 8:33 pm and received the cold pizza at 10:30 pm.  We called to complain and the excuse was he didn't put the order in right away.  I guess they don't realize that email confirmation from their company are sent out.  He did offer to make another pizza but why even take a chance at another 2 hour wait.  I wish I had read the reviews before I ordered.  They really should work on their customer service.  I would seriously be embarrassed to even deliver a cold pizza."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this pizza by my house, but I think I'll be ordering from Pizza Hut next time. I called and ordered the $7.99 one-topping special. When I went to get it, the lady who rang me up never, and I mean never, made eye-contact with me. She was short with me and everyone who called trying to place an order. After I paid, she went to the back to get my pizza and set it down at the farthest end of the counter instead of handing it to me..all while completely refusing to make eye contact. To make matters worse, the pizza looked like an oil field. There was a thick layer of grease over the pie. The strangest thing is that our pizza had like four pepperonis. They totally skimped on the topping. $7.99 is supposed to mean you get a deal, not crap. For what I got, I might as well order from Pizza Hut next time where at least I can expect consistency."}
{"text":"First time here ordered for pick up.The pizza is good and fair priced.  The workers are very rude with an attitude. Maybe because I was dressed down but I don't know if I'd want to go there again with attitudes like that."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here over 4 times & Every single time it was Perfect! All pasta the pasta dishes I ordered are so yummy! Now I do cook a lot at home But there Meatballs are the Best I had in a long time! They must be Homemade And I'm from back east so we are real Serious about Are food! You can Eat an Amazing dish delivered at 2am! It's so Amazing! Highly recommend this has been my go to Itailian restaurant since the place near the Liberace museum restaurant closed down I use to love that place too! This restaurant is Really Great Highly Recommended"}
{"text":"Ordering delivery from here. The food arrived reasonably quick, was 100% correct, and hot. We order two pies, wings & fries, and fingers. The pizzas were tasty, crisp crusts and good sauce. The chicken was well prepared and the saucing were perfect. Great local joint!"}
{"text":"Wait time was horrible, over a hour to get my food. I swear the jalapeños tasted they game out of a garbage can."}
{"text":"We ordered the taco pizza for delivery for the first time from here. We waited an hour for delivery, and the pizza was huge. But, it was so greasy. Granted it was a taco pizza with lots of cheese, but, unless youre a pizza grease fan, I'd look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this place via grub hub a total of 3 times.  I should have learned my lesson.  My husband loves their gyros...but that's all I can say that is positive about this place.  
Their tomato sauce has way too much paste...it has a terribly bitter taste.  I ordered the baked ziti previously...the sauce made it terrible.  This time I ordered the eggplant parmigiana sandwich.  The bun was stale and the eggplant was soggy.  There was one piece of deli cheese melted on top- but everything was cold and gross.  I won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"This place probably has too big of a menu, and should cut some items to focus on only doing others. However some of the complaints here are also humorous. For example... I'm not sure why people are ordering Gyro's here when two doors down is probably the top Gyro in the city. That's not what a pizza place is going to specialize in. Go down to the actual greek restaurant in the same shopping center for all things greek. That place rates highly and for good reason.

The lunch special is a fantastic deal. The Pizza is NY style. They do a solid job of it. I can confidently say I enjoyed the pizza, and would return. If you go there for the lunch special pizza you're getting a one topping pizza at 16 inches for $7. You can't beat that price.

I didn't try the pasta. We did have a salad with the meal and enjoyed that as well."}
{"text":"We came here despite the reviews. Maybe this is one of those hit-or-miss spots but we had decent food & decent service. 

We sat outside under a covered cuppola. After my husband ordered a server brought out plates & silverware & drinks within five minutes. The pizza took about 20 minutes, which was fine as we ordered special pizzas. 

The veggie pizza was good, as was our cheese/pepperoni pizza. The crust was thin like i like it, crispy on the bottom, not too greasy. And we actually added a little salt. The pepperoni pizza was a bit greasy but thats to be expected with pepperoni. 

I went in to get a refill on our drinks and it was free. 

I think maybe part of the problem with other reviews regarding the service is that east coast style pizzarias usually dont serve you and folks out here dont seem to be used to that. Ive seen this phenomenon out here on several occasions. 

We did go in to use the restrooms and they were very clean. So was the restaurant. 

A solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Best pizza place in Vegas! Open late hours and the food is absolutely amazing every single time."}
{"text":"Nothing wow about this place and the pizza is just ok. The service was slow and the workers were no the friendliest, the pretty much had an attitude from the minute we walked in. Not worth a return trip to this location"}
{"text":"I always used to get Napolis until today while I was enjoying a slice, I found a MAGGOT crawling across the cheese. I was absolutely disgusted. I hope it doesn't have anything to do with the fact that I corrected them when they gave me the wrong size pizza. Anyone who deliberately puts a maggot on someones food is seriously sick. Anyways, it was horrible and I will NEVER order from them again."}
{"text":"Food was solid and is probably a 4 (wife had pizza and I had stuffed shells). Service was painful, walked in and waited for takeout order. Counter help never checked back with us, ended up waiting 40 minutes for food. Good meal, lackluster service."}
{"text":"The best pizza I have ever had, across the US and in 10 different countries I've had pizza in (yes, including in Italy).  The sauce is perfectly tangy, cheese is melty and creamy, not rubbery and greasy, and the crust is perfect crunch and soft all at the same time.  The vegetable Sicilian should be featured somewhere for a benchmark of what is good pizza.  Huge pieces of vegetables, baked in the oven with fresh crushed garlic on top. It's the holy grail.  Legit, this is the best pizza you can get... how this hasn't been featured on TV yet is beyond me - see Martinelli G's picture of this thing of beauty."}
{"text":"They just can't get an order right, or don't want to.  I ordered a steak pizza that comes with onions, mushrooms and peppers through Grub hub.  It said no substitutions, but I'm allergic to mushrooms and don't like the peppers so I asked specifically to hold the mushrooms and peppers.  Holding items you can't eat is NOT a substitution.  $ 33 later I got the pizza with mushrooms and peppers.  There is nothing worse than having to dump a pizza in the trash that you waited and paid for.  I checked the order paperwork and the request to hold the items was there, they just decided to ignore it.  Thanks guys, I was a regular customer."}
{"text":"I'd just like to preface this with the fact that I never write negative reviews, but this had to be said... Their food is good, simple and indulgent. I'll give them that. Their service on the other hand is HORRIBLE. Walking through the door we're met with cold stares, no hello, no hi, nothing, and walking up to the counter almost feels like we're in trouble. It's like the staff there can't be bothered. My fiance and I have gone there for about two years now, trying to give them another chance (and because it was really our only option for pizza), but today was the last straw. We went in to pick up the order we called ahead for. Long story short, the lady at the counter was having issues with the card reader, and kept defiantly exclaiming that both of our cards were declined. We kept our cool and suggested maybe something was wrong with the machine. She said, \"No. It's declined. I just ran a credit a couple minutes ago.\" So, she ends up getting the manager... Lo and behold there WAS something wrong with the machine! After all of that- no apology, not even a change of attitude. Instead we got \"Well, it was denied.\" Unless you feel the food would be worth the trouble, stay away!"}
{"text":"We always buy from here since is behind out workplace , never complained about anything , but today they served a 3 days old salad"}
{"text":"Really great guy running the counter. The place was busy, but not too crowded. The fries were nice and crispy and the daily special allowed two of us to war for under $15 with fountain drinks! Pizza was really good too. We will be back- especially because of all the specials they offer."}
{"text":"I love chicken wings in napolis decatur. But since we live near their henderson branch, I ordered the same thing and they gave me most of drummers which I don't like. I prefer the wings. So now I called them, and requested for more wings instead of drumsticks. They want me to pay  $5 extra??? Seriously???"}
{"text":"Authentic pizzeria!  This place has been around practically FOREVER!!   Always a treat to stop in, and grab a slice of their New York style pizza.

The interior hasn't changed much over the years, but I give them a lot of credit. They are outnumbered by plenty of chain store pizza shops and other newly added trendy restaurants, but have managed to hold their own. Sometimes, it simply comes down to the product you serve and not always how new and pretty the furnishings around you look.

Napoli has always been my choice for pizza when I am in the area.  Good sauce and a great pizza crunch!"}
{"text":"I arrived and ordered 3 pizzas, according to my receipt I ordered the pizzas at 7:05, at around 7:50 a gentleman seated next to me pointed out that he had ordered after me and he had received his pizza.  I asked the waitress if my pizzas were ready and she went to the back to the kitchen and found them.  They were cold and she seemed like she didn't care, at one point she was actually laughing.    

The pizzas were ok, but the service was TERRIBLE! Never going back."}
{"text":"Dear Italians of the Las Vegas Valley, or anyone who appreciates authentic pizza,

Napoli pizzeria is not the place you are looking for. On top of that, it's overpriced.

We ordered the Sicilian. It is about the size of half the box and only resembles a Sicilian pizza in shape. $24.

We ordered the white face well done. It was rubbery. $18.

We will not be wasting our money here anymore.

Go to Settebello for Pizza Napoletana."}
{"text":"I lived in California my whole life.New to Las Vegas we ordered from here,wow I can't say enough just like my Mama's. the pizza great so good I have ordered from here at least three more times.Never disappointed try it if you're a real Italian you will love it. I never had a canoli just like my mom's ever two thumbs up.We have had pizza, Italian sub top notch meats real deal. I get delivery and believe me even the staff is friendly and nice and helpful and I have called places that aren't as nice and didn't get my business sure they didn't care about it either. I will only call here now anyway thanks for the great service and food."}
{"text":"This place is so hit or miss, unfortunately it seems it's been more miss than hit. I only ordered a combo app for delivery, I hit there $10 min but I guess they weren't happy with that. What they sent looks pathetic. Will also post a picture."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza place in Monroeville. I have always passed by this place because it looks old and stuck in the past, but looks definitely are fooling. Their pizza is nice and thin, crunchy on the outside and moist in the inside. Their red pizza sauce is delicious. All of their pizza toppings are fresh. This a handmade pizza from the crust to the toppings and this is how a pizza should be."}
{"text":"Over the last few times I've ordered, I've noticed a general slide in quality. They used to deliver fast and I literally live 4 blocks away from them. I had to wait close to 2 hours for delivery tonight for a salad. I got my food and it was the wrong one. The delivery guy came back and picked it up and brought me back what I ordered, but it isn't fresh. The chicken is soggy and not crispy, fresh and hot like it used to be. I'm very sad because I used to really love this place and spend a lot of money with them. :("}
{"text":"Really good!... Reuben sandwich was tasty.and the fries! Yum! Definitely will eat here again."}
{"text":"I will not be returning. The customer service is worse, if that's possible. They messed up my pizza order. So, they didn't send me a new pizza...they sent the toping....booooo. At some point even dilivery and late schedule doesnt make it worth it. But, in a pinch and drunk I guess this place is ok."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and the food is always good and the prices aren't bad. That's the only reason I'm giving them two stars today.

I ordered lunch from them a couple of weeks ago, and they said it would be ready at a certain time. Right around then, the guy calls to tell me he's arrived with my food. After a minute or so of waiting for him to knock on the door, I open it and see nobody outside. So I called back and told the guy I didn't see him, and he starts to get a little bit upset with me. He asked for my address again, and I gave it to him.

So about an hour later, I call again and ask if everything was okay with the order and delivery. The guy then begins to yell at me, saying that he's called multiple times and I never answer my phone, at which point the phone is, I assume, snatched from his hands. Another guy, who is hardly more friendly asks for my address and confirms my order. He assures me that someone will be there in less than an hour with my food. At this point, I probably should have cancelled my order and asked for a refund. 

So, as promised, about 40 minutes later (over four hours since I placed the order) a nice older man arrives with my food. He was very apologetic and sweet, their only saving grace that day. I finally crack open my meal, and the food is horrific. The wings were under-sauced and tasted old, and the fries weren't even edible. All that trouble, and I ended up with nothing more than an apology and gross food. I will not be eating here again, EVER."}
{"text":"I moved from NYC to Henderson right next to Sunset Station  Casino . Wednesday 10 pm my kids want NY style pizza only, what I will do now :)?. I thought I can find pizza in the casino so we went to Sunset casino their pizza place was closed :(. I searched in google \"24/7 open pizza in Henderson\" Napoli showed up they open till 3 am :)., we walked in cashier said we do have specials today medium   1 topping and its only 7.99 :) 
We did like the pizza we got very much it was very tasty but salty. Staff was very friendly , hours of operation is the best .I believe next time I can ask \"no salt \"  I would recommend Napoli Pizza  to everyone"}
{"text":"Food was great. Ordered a calzone, zeppoli, fried ravioli, and a cheeseburger sub. Also had the homemade lemonade, all which was great. Huge portions, did a special request order with out a problem. Fast delivery, friendly service.  The hours are great for ordering late night. They packaged things very well for delivery, which is a huge plus, all food was in tact and no sauces spilled.  Finally satisfied with overall experience of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place! The wings are the best! The pizza is a must as well. The only complaint I would have is that they didn't refill any of our waters today. So that is why only 4 stars."}
{"text":"Ok this review is based on customer service. It's 5:30 on a Wednesday evening. My family wants pizza. So I decide to call Napoli based on yelp reviews.  I called and a woman answered the phone. I wanted to confirm that they deliver to my neighbourhood, she asked for my cross streets and I say warm springs and Pueblo. The lady could not understand the word Pueblo. So I spell it to her and she still could not understand or even say the street name. She asks me if there is another cross street, so I tell her Warmsprings and Lake mead. Ok she understood that. Now for my address. I give her the name of my street and again spell it for her. She says umm can you spell it again slower. So I do. And she spells it back to me WRONG! I say no sorry it's not that. And again I spell it for her so slow that literally I gave her 1 letter per maybe 2 seconds before giving her another letter. AGAIN she can't get  it right!!! So I ask her this time if she understands what I am saying or is there a problem with our phone connection.  She says\" I can hear you, just not understanding\" UNDERSTANDING WHAT!!, you don't understand the alphabet? Because I'm just giving you the letters to my street name and you can't even understand that! No I did not say that , but I seriously thought it. Needless to say, I said never mind and took my business to Boxers Pizza. Very frustrated that Napoli would put someone answering and taking orders over the phone when they are obviously not good at speaking  or understanding English!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Finally some \"hot\" wings with taste!  The staff was courteous and the pizza and garlic balls were fantastic!"}
{"text":"I've eaten pizza from here a few times. Generous toppings and huge portions. The one thing I will say, if you get the huge sized pizza and you add a lot of toppings, the crust can be a little soggy. But I guess that might be expected?"}
{"text":"Honestly this place is kind of hit and miss. Not sure if they know how to tell time because I was quoted 40 mins. I arrived on time paid then was quoted an additional 15 mins. Now 20 mins later I'm still waiting here. So much for having my food ready for the fights. Guess I'll take my business elsewhere when time is a factor."}
{"text":"I LOVE Napoli Pizza!!!!!! Especially now that they've moved down the street to the plaza with Jason's Deli. Tons of parking instead of that little alley you had to squeeze into before. The pizza is large and obviously made with quality ingredients. My favorite side is the spicy potatoes!!!! I'm drooling just thinking about them! Fairly inexpensive and you get a ton of food. We never get delivery so I can't comment on the delivery times. Their new restaurant is great looking with plenty of tables including an outdoor dining area that might be utilized when weather permits. Staff has always treated us well, in fact my boyfriend and I now rate smiles since we come in so often. Desserts are pretty good, not all are freshly made, but the chocolate torte was awesome and the baklava is too :)"}
{"text":"I was pretty hungry, so I decided to give Napoli's a try and did their delivery service. Upside, the order came before the expected time, so that's why they got the second star. I got the Lasagna lunch special. The sauce is so watery, the pieces of lasagna are stuck together. The garlic bread that came with it is atrocious. Not even edible Tastes like they smothered the bread in some sort of butter substitute and there wasn't even the slightest garlic taste whatsoever. At least the lasagna wasn't disgusting and I could eat it. One downside to the delivery, the man who delivered it smelled terribly of cigarette smoke which makes me feel really sick to my stomach, so I'm sure that going into eating my food with a sick feeling sure didn't help. Don't waste your time with this place. I sure won't be ordering again!

Edit: I decided to make my 2 star rating a 1 star for this reason: I forgot that I ordered a slice of apple pie with my order... yeah. That is frozen...... I mean like, solidly frozen... Might I emphasize again... Don't even waste your time with this place. Awful!!!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be affordable, now if you want 40 Buffalo wings, it will cost you $51.99 , THAT'S outrageous!!!the wings aren't that big.!that's$1.30 a wing, I'll NEVER go back to them again. If you want large  wings at at great price, go to Angelina's pizza, next to Putters bar in the Albertsons Ctr at 5821 e Charleston  40 jumbo wings are $26.99.and the Stromboli is great!!!"}
{"text":"Everything is always great from this place. My kids live the giant pizza too. Customer service is always great and quick delivery ..customer for life"}
{"text":"Although the service isn't the best the pizza makes up for it, wing dings and pizza from Napoli are definitely on my to do list when I go out to Vegas since I don't live there anymore"}
{"text":"The burgers here! Yes this place is pizza place but oh my god does this place make burgers like no one's business. My girlfriend and I just had an order with pizza and burgers and I cannot believe how well made the food is. If anybody else is ever in the mood for pizza or burgers, this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"SLOW SLOW SLOW!!!!! An hour for an online order that said it would be ready in 20 minutes! Pathetic!! They did nothing to make it better. All  this BLONDE WHO YOU CANT UNDERSTAND Wanted to do was argue and be defensive with me. She went on to tell me if she could make the ovens go faster, she would...."}
{"text":"Great customer service. I've ordered the garlic knots for my kids and it took less than 10 minutes. The quality of the food is delicious. Highly recommend. Thank you"}
{"text":"How can you beat 2 slices of pieces with 2 toppings and a drink for $5.99 as a lunch special ?!?!?! Great deals for lunch all around. Pizza, burgers, salads. Major down fall was the super slow service. It took 10-15 min for 2 pizza lunch specials and an additional 30 min for a burger. We finished before my dad started."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have ordered delivery from this place. The first time the pizza was horrible, but I gave them a pass because we ordered Chicago style, and that doesn't always work for delivery.  We ordered a sausage, green pepper and mushroom pizza tonight, and when it was delivered it was not cooked through. After reheating in our oven for 20 minutes, it still wasn't cooked.  I called napolis to let them know, only to be told they would put a note in my account for next time, that I would prefer it to be cooked through.  No thank you, I will not be ordering from you again."}
{"text":"My favorite wings by far. I order the garlic Parmesan and xxxxxx hot wings. Both boneless. My favorite! They even text you when your order is on their way! How considerate"}
{"text":"I was really upset about the order I placed. I called and the girl over the phone said my pizza will take 20-25 mins. I get there and no pizza! They either lost the ticket or didn't take my order at all! They said I might have called a different location since they have three other ones but i showed them the number and the directions that were both obviously on Yelp that stated on Nelis! I even showed them my call and time frame on my recent calls since they didn't want to believe me! Even after I paid for my pizza the guy that seems like the manager asks did u want to do tip on card or drop it in the box? The freak!? I'm not trying to leave squat if you can't even take a simple order! How dare they question where I want to leave a tip for them for not doing something right! Never again! The food is mediocre also! There wasn't enough pepperoni for their one topping \"special\". Worst place to drive out of my way for just pizza!"}
{"text":"Our family loves this place! Delicious pizza, wings & fries! We always order take out and it's always ready on time :)"}
{"text":"It's mixed here. I have been here 4 times and it's pretty good. Staff is friendly, set up is horrible I hate eating and having people in line right next to me seems annoying.  

Pizza is fine only had the cheese and pep.  My kids love it and always eat eat all. I have had the taco salad, chopped salad and the Greek salad at different times. All are very good and you get what you pay for.  

One other thing that's annoying is the drink machine is behind the counter so for the first few visits I didn't even know you could get refills. They need to do some work on the layout to make it better for diners or have it just take out only."}
{"text":"Not exactly sure how to rate this place. . . So 1 star for the cheap lunch specials, Mom got a spinach and mushroom calzone and I got a pepperoni and mushroom calzone, plus 2 drinks came to $16. 1 star for the huge calzone, seriously it was massive! 1 star cuz it was tasty too, although mine was a lil greasy but I'm guessing it from the pepperoni, because my mom's wasn't at all. 1 star for the food coming out fairly quickly despite the number of people there and the phone orders they were taking. Minus 1 star for waiting so long for drinks. Customer service was meh besides that, and I'm pretty sure the girl that took our order was new. So 3 stars for the meh-bad service but cheap, yummy (at least the calzones) eats"}
{"text":"I order from these guys all the time, I love the pizza but it never ever fills me up. I can eat a whole large pizza to myself. I sadly found two hairs baked in my pizza. In two separate slices. I still ate them because I was hungry and I called and the guy that answered stated all his employees were wearing hair nets and that he didn't know how the hairs got into my pizza. I have like a brown inch long hair and these hairs were like black and a foot long. And all this happened after I had already ate some wings and over half my pizza so I couldn't take it back. I think I'll go to a different location next time"}
{"text":"This place is seriously a life saver . After a late date night at multiple restaurants Saturday night we Ordered delivery from Napoli (twice in one Sunday!) Front of the house staff was much nicer, and accurate . A sweetheart by the name of Stephanie -was a pure doll, and the gentleman that handled our next order later that night was making me bust up laughing. With a severe lack of sleep, and a hangover ...this was much appreciated . The littlest things make a huge difference! Savory dishes you might like...

Hot Sausage, meatball Sandwhich
Lasagna- perfect
Ceaser Salad - (fresh parm/ great dressing)     Never any wilted Romain Lettuce 
Cheese Pizza-MUCH MORE fresh than any other place I've ordered . 

We have them add their fresh artichokes to our pizza &its bomb! Lol Well, I hope this is helpful! Happy Eating! Xoxo -Josephine 

Remember! Fresh food takes time! Worth the wait !"}
{"text":"Since I am super anti-Angelina's pizza I checked this place out for take out before one of the NBA games. 

They were okay, but I won't be back anytime soon.

Their garlic balls were not as good, their pizza was nothing special, and their wings were okay too.

My main annoyance with this place is that they quoted me 20-30 minutes, but the pick up took more like an hour. I showed up about 15 minutes past the quoted time, and my food still wasn't done. I paid and waited another 15 minutes. It was annoying and they didn't handle it in any sort of apologetic way."}
{"text":"Best subs I've found in pittsburgh, honestly this is my absolute goto when we're talking cheese steak subs. Big, tasty, meaty, goodness.

Pizza aint bad, and they have 6 packs!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed!! Best pizza in town! Has the freshest ingredients and make it when you order it. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for delicious authentic pizza. And not these places that have had pizza warming and waiting for who knows how long."}
{"text":"I love this place every time we are in Vegas they come to our rescue not to mention they can always feed a village 
They have great wings and fries and their pizza is great fresh 
Their prices are reasonable better than a restaurant or hotel food
They will always be my go to for late night convenient eating in Las Vegas and they are an off the strip delivery service as well"}
{"text":"Best pizza this side of town has. People were very nice and I would recommend if you're going to do a birthday party at flipping out you come over here order your pizza grab a few tables. The staff help me with plates and cups and were excellent to all the kids. Thanks for making our birthday lunch perfect."}
{"text":"Creatively yummy pizza. Lots and lots of options at a good price. I had my sons birthday party here, I was very pleased. We had a big group and the service rocked!"}
{"text":"I used to order Napoli's multiple times a week due to the sheer number of people always hanging around. A little over a year ago, it was great, delivery was always slow but the food was amazing. The best part about Napolis is that they deliver until 3AM and are open inside until 4 or 5am..

In the past 8 months or so, it has been on the decline. I live one street away and it ALWAYS takes well over an hour for delivery. Also the food has been subpar and EVERY order of mine has been wrong or items left out. I have given Napolis a small fortune over the past two years but I can no longer support this business with how bad it has become. Not to mention, it's not the cheapest place.

The last straw: I called Napolis to place and order, I was put on hold as soon as the call went through. I waited 5 minutes, hung up, called back, tried to say wait before being put on hold, they did it instantly again. I waited 3 minutes again, no click over so I hung up. Now I was pissed..... So I chained called them about 6 times, and every time they would answer I couldn't even get a word in before being put on hold.

Never will I order from here again and I would advise the same to anyone else looking for a late night snack, eat some carrots."}
{"text":"This food was amazing, they were quick at delivery as well. Usually I'm very picky about my pizza delivery because it always ends up cold, the pizza was still warm and tasted great. The wings!! Don't get me started the wings were amazing. Very satisfied with the service and the food."}
{"text":"Out of all the pizza restaurants in Henderson, Napoli is the best. Generous toppings and never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Decent food for the price, large 1 topping for 7.99 for pick up. Not much choice in Henderson for ny style pizza, I'd rather have napolis than pizza hut, dominos, and especially papa johns, it's also cheaper than those places."}
{"text":"I was a little worried about ordering from here after reading some of the bad reviews, but im glad i did. I ordered a large supreme pizza and 2 brownies. The pizza was amazing!!! if you like new york style pizza, then this is the place to go! my order only took a little over a half hour. i was pleasantly surprised. the delivery guy seemed sort of quiet and stand off-ish, but im sure it was because my dog was barking at him very loudly. i think he was scared. i will definetely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Their BBQ chicken pizza is absolutely mouth watering!!!!! A++++ service!!! Their pizza is VERY close to NY PIZZA...best in henderson!!!"}
{"text":"Food was really good, however staff was a little slow in cleaning up and getting their attention for drinks or forks or anything else we needed but like I said food was yummy"}
{"text":"Ordered veal piccata got veal marsala! Good food but they always seem to screw something up!"}
{"text":"I ordered a 16\" 4 item pizza.  The pie was ok, it wasnt greasy as reported by others and the crust was good.  I am a self proclaimed pizza snob which is the reason for the 3 stars.  The delivery was about an hour and 15 minutes at 430 pm.  I had requested a well done crust but it was still soggy in the middle.  The staff was busy but friendly and the delivery guy seemed like a manager as he was very nice and friendly, almost appreciative for doing business.  Given my location I had no other options and I would order again in this situation."}
{"text":"There was a mix up on our order. The EAT app has issues. Napoli Pizza decided on their own to make things right for us. The manager came personally to deliver. Outstanding customer service. I am now a lifetime customer!"}
{"text":"I love the white pizza here! I love that this place is open until late at night, I believe they're open until 3 AM, so that's always been pretty convenient. I've been here around 3 times and have always ordered my food to go, I usually get a notification saying the food will be ready in 20 mins but everytime I get there I have to wait another 10 to 15 mins on top of the 20 to get my food."}
{"text":"My family and I have been ordering from Napoli pizza for years. We love the food, especially their hot chicken fingers and spicy traditional wings, but we also love the great service we receive. While I will admit their prices may be a little bit higher than traditional pizza places, the quality of food you receive is well worth the cost. Our favorite special to order is the #10 anytime special which includes a large one topping pizza, 10 chicken fingers, fries, and a 2 liter soda. I come from a family of 5 siblings so we order this meal to make sure everyone has enough food they can enjoy and typically, we tend to have left overs at the end, which are even better the next day. So if you're looking for a great pizza and wing joint, this is the place to go. Stop in or order delivery, but either way, you'll certainly be glad you tried this place."}
{"text":"I use to really like this place but it has gone down hill over the last year. The last 3 times I have ordered either certain items never came or was not what we ordered. 

The delivery time can also be long like over an hour."}
{"text":"Mmmmm Italian Wedding soup! And the pizza can't be beat. And the wings are very flavorful and meaty. Not sure why so many complaints in service. The counter was well staffed and we were greeted promptly. A manager even came by to check on things. We've even had it delivered, love the late hours."}
{"text":"About as close as you will get to New York style pizza in Vegas/Henderson......and the  \"Pick Up Special, 16 inch pizza, one topping\", for $8.99, is a very good deal."}
{"text":"I don't know when we first tried Napoli, but we kept going back due to their diverse menu of pizza and friend food, plus their location and hours. I will say first off, that do not ever, under any circumstances get delivery from Napoli. As other Yelpers mentioned, it takes FOREVER. We were able to do carry out most of the time because it was near our house. We dined in a couple of times, but it was always a bit awkward because the dining room is right next to the kitchen, there was always staff or family of staff in the dining room, and the TV's were blaring....it also occasional felt as if we were interrupting some Eastern European mob meeting of some sort. Anyway...the pizza was good. Always fresh, quality ingredients and a variety of ingredients. Our staple here was usually the pineapple, ham and onions, but it ranged. The pineapple was canned, but everything else was fresh on that particular pie. 
Napoli is a virtual fat kid paradise, because you can get sandwiches, fried chicken and a variety of other dishes here...they also had dessert, but we never tried any of that. Beyond the pizza, we would get salad and occasionally fries. 
They are open really late, which is also a plus."}
{"text":"Was a big fan of Napoli's before trying this location. I ordered delivery and you can usually never go wrong with any of their pastas, but when receiving my spaghetti w/ Italian sausage, the sausage was so burnt it was inedible. And to add, they didn't give any garlic bread (which is the best part)! Secondly, the tuna melt i ordered was very poorly prepared and the bread was soo hard, that too was inedible. Sad to say i wasted my time and money here."}
{"text":"Great Pizza & Garlic knots.......horrible customer service! We go here quit often because the pizza is good and they have great specials, but if it's customer care you looking for.......you defiantly will not find it here! All and I mean all the staff is rude! If you walk in and there is a man at the counter they will not acknowledge you or take your order or nothing they will sit there and talk to each other like you don't exist until one of the young girls finally comes out to help you! Same thing on the phone on a busy night they can put you on hold till you get sick of it and just hang up! So if you want good cheap pizza and don't care about getting it w/o a smile or a thank you, this is your place!"}
{"text":"The chicken wings are always crispy and on point. Last Sunday they were undercooked and made with the wrong sauce. We ordered a 40 piece and barely ate 10. I called them and told me the manager would call me in three hours. Which would be midnight. I told them I don't want my money back I just wanted them replaced. Very disappointed with you guys."}
{"text":"I called to place a pick up order today and got hung up because the lady answering the phone was getting frustrated because I couldn't understand what she was saying (language barrier). I work in customer service, and part of the job is to be patient and be understandable of your customers.  I called back a 2nd time after getting hung up on and I believe the same lady answer or someone else, and I told her that I got hung up on when I called to place my order and I got hung up, yet again without taking my order.  I never had this experience before ordering from here and I loved the pizzas , but now Im taking my money and business somewhere else."}
{"text":"We ordered $50 bucks worth to be delivered...the chicken cacciatore was literally like rubber and no parmesan cheese included with the ziti WTF? My rommie asked for just white meat fried chicken and didn't get that either!"}
{"text":"Pizza was decent however it took 30 mins for a to go order when the pizza was just sitting there.  When we asked for the pizza a 4 th time she just threw the box at us and walked away.  Won't go back"}
{"text":"This place is a joke, vary unprofessional and cheap ingredients. Don't waste your hard earned money on this place.."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! 

I was ordering an 18inch with 20 wings & some fries. The girl who answered offered me a special for the pizza with one topping & the wings. I asked her about 6 to 7 what would be the difference in adding two more toppings to the pizza. She kept cutting me off & asking anything else after I kept asking what's the difference.... We were speaking the same language here so why would you not answer my question? After she was trying to push the special on me so much she couldn't even answer a simple question. Not only that but literally every other minute she's like hello hello while I'm talking directly to her. I was already annoyed so 40 minutes later my friends & I go pick up the order.
As I'm going in I wanted to speak to the girl who took my order so I can see what the total difference was & as soon as I told her you kept cutting me off when I was asking for the difference she literally sat there & lied no I told you, I told you it would be cheaper like WTFFWTF !!!! I immediately had to say something to her & lucky the manager put down the phone & what a coincidence the manager tells me yeah I heard her tell you she's a great girl blahblah like idc how great she can be as a person you're working, do your job & have good customer service. I was simply asking a simple question & she sits there & lies about. Luckily the manager ended up giving me the special which was only $8 difference that the dumbass girl could have just told me. The food is good but if your working customer service the food will never make up for how shitty you get treated. Never recommending."}
{"text":"We ordered the manicotti, pizza and antipasto salad for a lunch at work and everything was absolutely delicious. I can't wait to order from them again."}
{"text":"I went to their website to check them out and saw that you could pre-order for a set delivery time instead of having it delivered right then so I picked a time more than 2 hours later.

It was still late.

I ordered a burger and they give you two choices on how you want it cooked:  Medium well and well done.  I picked medium well.  It was borderline rare it was so pink.

I also got the potato salad as a side.  If I'd known the serving was so small, I would have ordered fries instead.  Plus, it was very bland."}
{"text":"I've passed by Napoli more times than I can count on my way to the Great Greek in the same strip of shops. After almost three years of passing by we decided to stop in and give them a try.

Friday night I tried to call in an order for a pick up to take with me over to Bad Beat Brewery. The wait on a pick up was 35-40 minutes and the woman on the phone was less than pleasant. So I scratched that and grabbed Freddy's instead.

Saturday rolls around and my husband decides he still wants to try Napoli. We arrived around 6:30 on Saturday night and so did everybody else in the neighborhood. They were very busy. My husband was instantly taken back by the chaos and said he wanted to be their business consultant to help with improving their process, haha. In case they care....they need a spot for take out orders (not on top of the dessert case where they were constantly knocking things over trying to find space) and dirty dishes and plates should go to the wash area (not on the dessert case next to food).

We stepped up to the counter, ordered, and then grabbed a table to wait for our food. My salad came out after about 10 minutes, breadsticks after 30, and then our pizza about 10 minutes after that. The guy dropping our food was apologetic for the wait, but I can definitely see why others have complained about the wait times.

The House Salad with Italian was boring, but fresh. The dressing seemed like it was made with cheap oil so I'd get a different dressing if I ordered again. The breadsticks were really good and came with enough for several people to share. They tasted homemade and the bread itself had great flavor. I would enjoy these even without all of the butter on top. Our Mexican pizza (pepperoni, beef, chorizo, cilantro, onions, and jalapenos) was really good. I liked the crispy crust and indulgent greasy nature of the pizza.

This is a good local spot to grab a decent pizza."}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars solely for the fact that they deliver into the odd hours of the night. It's good hangover food (from what I've heard), and it hits the spot if you're feeling in the mood for anything greasy, cheesy, and gooey. 

The pizzas and burgers are pretty good. If you order burgers, they come with fries, but the fries are pretty forgettable. I do like the italian sodas though.. goes well with the greasiness :)

Delivery times vary.. but I think the quickest time they've delivered was under 30 minutes (for burgers) and up to an hour for pizzas. I've had good experiences with the delivery people as well as the cashiers when I place my order, so no complaints! They take credit card over the phone too which is pretty convenient :)"}
{"text":"This place needs to go back to the basics of customer service! They got 2 stars because of their extended hours of operation and their pizza was okay, but the service SUCKED! I called to place my order and waited close to 10 minutes on hold, benefit of the doubt told me they were just busy since it was late, but once I got there I couldn't  even get a \"thank you\" or a smile when I was picking up. Did get some free entertainment in the parking lot while waiting from the dramatic drunk girl. Don't recommend this place unless you're desperate, I personally will probably not be going back."}
{"text":"Service is everything!! The man at the counter was a total jerk, we had already ordered food and were thinking about buying some can soda they had.. so we returned to the counter to see how much a soda was then after we just asked him a simple question, he becomes rude and insults us, treating us as if we're poor or something. Then when we received our food he acted like nothing happened... totally uncalled for ! I was a first time customer and I was planning on continuing to come because they're so close but that service left a bad taste in my mouth!"}
{"text":"Heard good things about Napoli, however our first experience was not good. The food took forever to come out...for just a Caesar salad and spaghetti. Blackened chicken Caesar was ok. Prices were high for their \"lunch specials\" and didn't even include bread. Spaghetti was horrible and served on a dirty plate. I would have gone across the street to Fazoli's next time."}
{"text":"The pizza is great thin crust pizza!  But as noted before, the delivery time varies.  They also have tons of other thing: pasta, hot sandwiches, etc.  I've only tried the pizza though.

They also have this ridiculous 30 inch pizza.  We have ordered it a few times in an attempt (always happens during test weeks) to finish it, and we never can.  It is good though, and I promise I give it my best try!  hahah.  

So overall, good pizza, worth trying.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Just had the worst customer service ever. I order here frequently for home and for work. I always order extra ranch dressing for all my items. When I got my delivery, they forgot my large ranch, no biggie it happens right, so I just called them and asked to bring it back out. The manager came in the phone and wanted to give me credit for it and not bring it back out, which didn't work for me because everything I ordered is an item we use ranch on so I declined that offer and asked him to please send it out. Then he became really petty and said \"well I did not charge you for the extra tzaziki sauce you asked for, so I will send the driver out with your large ranch but you will need to pay him $1.00 for the sauce I didn't charge you for.\" VERY PETTY. First off I didn't ask you not to charge me for a sauce but whatever, send the ranch, so I can enjoy the 53.41 worth of food that I have sitting here in front of me. 
Meanwhile My daughter ate her 10\" cheese pizza, and with the small cup of ranch that I did have I had my cheese sticks and 2 of 10 chicken fingers I ordered. Then I wait, and I wait some more. 45 minutes have passed since I called back for my ranch. The food is all cold. I put it back in the bag and headed out to bring it back. As I was pulling into to restaurant, which is only about 6 minutes away from my home, the delivery driver called that he is at my house with the ranch, and I told him I was back at the store to return the cold food.
I told the manager (who I think is the owner maybe) at the store I was returning everything except the small cheese pizza and the mozzarella sticks. He gave my a hard time that I was returning almost the whole order over ranch, and I tried to explain that it's now being returned because it's cold. We tried to start eating and wait for the delivery, shouldn't have been a problem, you don't have to cook ranch and we are 6 minutes away, but because it took you 45 minutes to bring me the ranch that I ordered and paid for previously (which is longer than it took for you to deliver the original food order....... and which I am certain he did out of spite because he was angry for whatever reason that I wanted the ranch delivered and not put on my account as a credit) the food is all now cold.... it was not my intention to return it, we just wanted to eat.
He finally agreed that he was going to give me a refund minus those two items that I told him we consumed. THE REAL KICKER AND WHAT REALLY PROMPTED ME TO WRITE MY First EVER YELP REVIEW, is that then he actually went through and opened each box and started counting pieces of food, and he a actually PRORATED the refund cost of the chicken fingers, since I did eat 2 of 10..... I would rather have had my ranch and eaten more. So I am awaiting a partial refund, for which I wasn't given a receipt and am not even sure if I will get or not. 
It was a very insulting experience, and unfortunately will be my last order with Napoli. Kinda sucks for me because I like the food, but will kinda suck for them too because when I order there for work every week it's an order for 20-30 people, and usually is $250-$300+ ,  it I will definitely order elsewhere after being treated that way."}
{"text":"DEEEEEEEELISH!!!!!



    I really debated about coming here because they had some seriously mixed reviews BUT we're in the area of the City of Sin, so why not gamble and I'm so glad we did!!!! Plus most of their bad reviews were about the delivery.  I also went with this place because they stay open extremely late and the other pizza joints didn't stay as open or had a full dining room to enjoy in house.  So this was a perfect choice for us 5 ladies and a puppy LOL.

   So we walk in and we try to figure out where to sit.  We grabbed menus and discussed among each other on what shall we order. Five women aren't going to agree on one type of pizza so we had to get 2! We also discussed other things to fill upon :p  So we ordered a medium Cheese and the other half Sausage and pepperoni, the other was  half pepperoni and the other sausage, I was the dbag who wanted cheese only hence 2 pizzas HAHA.  We also doubled the carbs with garlic bread sticks. We also ordered honey bbq chicken wings and caprese salad. Baby sister also wanted fries but they forgot to give them to us and who needed those with all this food o_O 

  So the service here is AOK. I don't know what part of Europe these folks are from but the young ladies seem to be doing all the front of the house work, they may seem cold but I really think it's their culture and they don't mean any harm.  The food was VERY good. Fresh pizza and not dry at all. The bread sticks were so addicting. I mean even with the pizza, I had to try it and I couldn't stop. Making it easy just to have one slice of pizza, two wings and a bread stick LOL. My sister wanted the caprese salad last minute . This was VERY good. Sadly it was to unique for my sister as it came topped with a tapenade, basil sprinkle  and chunks of olives. This was good for me but for her, she just wants the tomato and cheese with the olive oil drizzle.  I gave her A for effort and trying more than 2 bites. We  LOVED the honey bbq wings.  Moist, big and great sauce! We all thought this was a solid meal.  Oh and their rice pudding was so good and random for a pizza joint.

  I can't compare to the other pizza joints in the area but this hit the spot for us. The wings were so good to my family, they came back two days later just for the wings.  So again, sorry that a lot of people got the short end of the stick, but we lucked out and I enjoyed VERY much!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, it was so-so. The calamari strips tasted and looked exactly like fish sticks, absolutely don't recommend. The chicken philly had too much bread, the ratio between the filling and the bread was very disproportionate. And my salad was just plain soggy and bland. The delivery guy was very nice though!"}
{"text":"I love the food but I will NEVER order delivery again!!! I ordered my food over two hours ago and I'm still waiting!!! The driver called me and when I try to tell him how to get here he just gets mad and hangs up!!! Never again will I get delivery  from this place again!!!! Delivery service terrible and very very rude!!!! And after all that I even walked out of my complex and still he kept hanging up one me!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago so the pizza here to me was just decent. Nothing to write home about, but it was ok. They also have very late hours/late delivery, which is all a plus. However, the attitude I received when I went in to order my pizza was horrible. So much so that I've never been back and never will. Too many other places to choose from and tell my family and friends about than to receive decent food with horrible customer service. I would expect more from the service industry Mecca of the world. A little friendliness will go a long way."}
{"text":"So I have been here before in the past. Pizza was always good but the environment needed work. Well it's been awhile and we decided to try it out again today. So glad we did. They have remodeled...new tables, chairs, no more red and white checkered table clothes, new bathroom design, fresh paint and design, they cleaned the windows and removed the tint. The dining area is bright and clean and more spacious. Before it seemed crowded. They refrigerate the Parmesan cheese which is great. It's not just left out on the tables all day. The whole environment is just so much better. Staff was helpful and welcoming and of course the pizza, chicken tenders and fries are soooo delicious. It's really a great deal and a great place for a family dinner out."}
{"text":"I don't care if all I got here was a ceasar salad. That was one of the best ceasar salads I have ever had the chicken was super fresh and lightly seasoned just enough so it wasn't overwhelming. The staff at this place is super nice and friendly they will talk with you while.ypu.wait for your food to come out and the aroma of the marina and pizza coming out fresh will deff not hurt the chances of me coming get back in for a pie the next time I'm in the mood. The cleanliness of this place is also spot on unlike Jason's deli across the parking lot they could learn some things from napoli like how to empty the trash and sweep the floor but regardless no one cares about them. Hit this place up!"}
{"text":"Yes it takes some time for your food to arrive. And yes it's not amazing quality. But they deliver to your room at 1 am and its friggin pizza so cut them some slack! I recommend to anyone looking for a midnight snack at the room!"}
{"text":"Funny, I am sitting here reading the reviews and one thing that is consistent is how rude the girl is! Well I truley concur with this statement. FIRE HER ALREADY!!! She has zero customer service skills, like really?
Can I atleast get a smile. I had the gryo salad which SUCKED! Meat looked old, dressing was terrible, and I had to ask for tziki sauce, and then I was told I would be charged $$1.08 for it. I specifically asked for tziki when I ordered the salad, why didn't I get charged then!!? I ended up only eating 2 bites before I threw the salad in the trash. WASTE OF $8.00!!
My friend got a burger and only ate half, she said the meat was so dry she couldn't finish it. 
They do have some good things here, but I will not be back due to the treatment and lack of customer service. The girl at the counter needs a serious attidude ajustment!! Your losing business over this rude broad!
FIRE HER!!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in town great food! good value! Im from the East Coast it's really hard to find a good pizza place tastes as good as theirs!"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. I have celiacs disease and ordered a gluten free pizza. In a nutshell it was inedible. It was burnt, tough and flavorless. I eat at many different restaurants and have sampled various gluten free options, some are better than others, this is honestly the worst I have ever had and I paid $24.00 for it (14\"). I can't believe they served this to me with a straight face."}
{"text":"I love Napoli Pizza. I have been sharing their pizza and chicken with friends and family member since I was a kid. Over 10 years of great food being brought to my door from Napoli's. I ordered tonight and had a delicious pizza, fingers, and fries delivered.

My pizza was amazing as usual. And the fingers were very large and delicious. We ordered mild and they were perfect. When I grabbed a fry I immediately felt the regret of not eating in the store. There isn't any holes in the box to release the steam. They were still eaten because the quality of the fry is good. Fingers were slightly less soggy. Once again was feeling like I shouldn't be having them deliver that won't keep crisp for the ten minute drive to my house. I was happy to have the food delivered and it was delicious as usual but not a huge fan of delivery.

I would like to comment on the customer service. One night I was stuck staying in a hotel because my home wasn't ready to move in to. I did not have my id or money with me and my mother ordered a pizza to my hotel room. She was not with me and stated to the company that we order there all the time and that she was ordering for me in a hotel room, not at our usual address that shows up in their system. When the pizza arrived the driver smelled and heard the party i had going on in my room. He looked like he wasted to join because he was asking about what we were doing and I almost invited him in for a drink. He suddenly changed his entire attitude when I told him that my mother lives at the address on file and she was not in the hotel with the card. He told me that I needed to ask one of my friend for some cash because he can't give me my order unless he can see the card. I let him know how ofter we order and he even agreed that he had seen me before. As I am standing there telling him how sorry I am and telling him how I understand that we were 10 miles from his store he started asking me to have my mom drive over right away. It was one in the morning. I was then very upset and slammed the door in his face. I didn't have Napoli's for about a year after that. My mothers card was refunded and we ended up ordering some crap pizza from somewhere else. 

I have noticed that all of their drivers and pizza cooks are men and that they only hire girls that look like they just turned 18 to work the front counter. Most of the time when they are busy, which is most of the time, the girls don't know how to handle the rush and just become rude and unorganized.

I give Napoli's 4 stars because i feel like they know how good their pizza is and that's why they chose to have such bad customer service. I'm not sure that I can hate them because of that."}
{"text":"Decent pizza for the price.  Not good enough for repeat business though.  I'd rather pay a little bit more if it meant better pizza.  My crust was too thick and doughy.  Definitely not true Neapolitan."}
{"text":"Worst service. I called for a pick up and when the guy was taking my order he was so rude, and then HUNG UP ON ME!!!! What kind of service is this?! I work in customer service, and this place is horrible."}
{"text":"I have ordered here many times, the pizza is really good but their customer service is horrible. The last time i ordered they took two hours, i called after the hour and a half and the woman on the phone yelled at me saying it had been less than 30 minutes--she even called me back to tell me this after i originally made the complaint. This time they forgot part of my order, told me theyd be back in 20 minutes and it took over an hour-- i had to call them and remind them! They have horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Been going here for years.  The lunch special two pieces and a soda my favorite thing about Napoli Pizza.  The slices are ridiculous and are easily enough for two people at lunch.  Pricing is super fair and the quality of the pizza is fantastic.  If you enjoy that thin crust, floppy, cheesy goodness, then Napoli is for you.  Locations in Henderson and Las Vegas on Decatur.  I think they remodeled the Henderson location which is my only complaint because it feels very much like a cafe, whereas before it seemed more like a pizzeria.  Would have been 5 stars otherwise."}
{"text":"Hands down, the absolute best thin crust pizza I've ever had. The pepperoni roll is insanely huge too."}
{"text":"Pizza is always delivered under cooked.  We have tried them twice...but never again.
And no, I don't want your 20 dollar credit. If you had fixed out issue this time...maybe there would have been another time."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza, picked it up 10 minutes later. Service was good. People were friendly. Pizza was bomb!"}
{"text":"If you like waiting over an hour for your pickup order this is the place for you.
Every time we come here they take foreverrrrr to give you your order, I suspect they don't actually start making your food until you get here and pay which defeats the purpose of ordering ahead. 

I hate nothing more than being told it will be ready in 30 min and you get there 30 min and wait 45 more min to get your food what kind of bullshit is this ?????  Happens every time ..."}
{"text":"Pizza good but the service is crap, been there a few times and the owner literally just ignores you, doesn't call anyone over or say someone will be right with just look at me and doesn't say a word but the pizza is good so I still go jajaja"}
{"text":"I called to place an order and I was put on hold 5 minutes. I hung up and called again and they put me directly on hold.  Poor customer service means i will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"So far the best pizza I have had in pittsburgh area. Go tos are the sicilian with meatball and the stuffed broccoli and cheese pizza. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I am a fan of pizza. However, I am a bigger fan of eggplant parmesan. When I visit a pizzeria, and an eggplant parmesan hero or eggplant parmesan special is on the menu, forget about the pizza. This has always been the case with Metro Pizza. 

  A few Sundays ago, after living in Henderson for like ten years, I finally caught Napoli's act. It just so happened that I was up to something different for lunch when quite a few restaurants were closed on Sunday. I thought this is Las Vegas, a City that never sleeps. Anyways, recently I wanted to try Napoli's despite some negative reviews by reputable Yelper's. I was in an adventurous mood. What's the worst that could of happened?  

  The negative reviews wouldn't pertain to my experience. The majority of those reviews pertain to the pizza and wait time. As soon as I looked at the menu and read eggplant parmesan hero, I was ecstatic. I have been looking for restaurants nearby that make the eggplant parmesan hero, a sandwich that I have fond memories of in New York. I had my choice of over 100 Coke beverages to compliment the eggplant parmesan. Napoli's has the Coke Freestyle machine. I love these machines because they feature my favorite soft drink in the World: strawberry soda. How can I not appreciate a marriage of my favorite soft drink and one of my dearest foods? I paid at the counter, consequently the woman I paid the money to would serve the food and drink on the red and white patterned tablecloth. The eggplant parmesan on toasted bread was out of this World delicious. The French fries weren't bad either. The wait between order and the food was around 15 minutes. I'd wait a far longer amount of time for this. 

  What is better than an eggplant parmesan hero is eggplant parmesan with spaghetti and garlic bread. What is best is when it only costs $8.99 with a Coke beverage in a large glass. Napoli's is far more than pizza. Up til 3 p.m., on weekdays the lunch specials menu are fantastic. There are so many choices. I have been decided on the eggplant parmesan with spaghetti. The three times that I have delighted in this dish, I have left satisfied and wanting to return. The eggplant parmesan with the mouth watering mozzarella cheese is hot. It's served with the eggplant parmesan on the top of spaghetti. The portion is generous. The wait times ranged between 20 to 25 minutes on the last three visits. While I waited, I enjoyed the uptempo music and Fanta strawberry soda. Most of all I really enjoyed eating the eggplant parmesan with spaghetti and drinking the Strawberry Fanta. 

  Owing to the fact that I am a lover of eggplant parmesan and can never ever get enough of it, I am a fan of Napoli's. The fact that right now I'm getting hungry thinking about their eggplant parmesan means I  will be returning."}
{"text":"Ugh! When a 2 year old won't eat the baked ziti, you know the food has a problem. When you're promised a 25 min pick up time for carry out and you get there on time and still have to sit and wait, you have a problem. When the teenagers are hustling but the manager on duty seems to be clueless, you have a problem. The sandwich we ordered was soggy on the bottom, burnt on the top, the sausage was not cooked all the way through, and you can get better meatballs out of the freezer section of your local grocery store. The Greek pizza was blah. The dough tasted like cardboard, the sauce had no flavor, and the only thing that was Greek about it was the saltiness of the food service olives. In short, this was one of the most underwhelming food experiences we've had in Vegas. 1 star, and even that hasn't been earned in this case."}
{"text":"On yelp  Delivery says $2.50 they tried charging me $5,  This is my 1st time ordering from them and my last good luck everybody."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their pizza! After reading reviews of several pizza places around our hotel, we decided to try Napoli and I'm glad we did. Everyone in there was friendly and professional. We will be going back before we leave!"}
{"text":"Just saw a black lexus at the intersection of marks and trail canyon with a napoli pizza sticker on the side blow through a stop sign @ 4:23 pm 9/7/15. That aint cool."}
{"text":"Taste good... fried chicken wings with garlic parmesan & their pizza's are good.
The only thing service is bad.. I ordered for pick up 2 hours prior but when time came for pick up they just started to prepare the said orders."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken parm and the portion was more than enough for a small village. Okay slight exaggeration but it was more than enough for two hungry adults. This was an online order placed via their website for delivery. Ordering process was easy and smooth.  The delivery arrived timely and was piping hot. I am a bit of an Italian food snob but I would give them a solid 7 out of 10 overall.  The food was good, especially if you are fond of copious amounts of delicious melted cheese. The chicken was cooked perfectly moist and tender and there was plenty of sauce to dip the delicious garlic bread to my hearts content.
The 3 missing points out of 10 related to this experience.  1. Better plates and plastic utensils.  The flimsy plates and utensils are not sufficient for the substantial meal. 2.  Drain the pasta completely.  This order had a fair amount of water left in the pasta watering down the delicious sauce. 3.  Offer some fresh grated parm or ramano with this menu item. I would order from them again and would recommend this restaurnt as  solid go to for italian food."}
{"text":"I've ordered for pick-up a few times from this location. I used to live in Henderson and love that location. The food is good and the girls are very friendly. My only complaint is about the man that takes the orders sometimes. He isn't friendly and I always see him talking down to the other employees. I called on Saturday to place an order. He answered and when I said I'd pick it up he rudely asked how I was going to get there. I said excuse me because no one had ever asked me how I going to pick it up. He then continued to shout with an attitude saying I needed to get there in 6 minutes before they close. I just said nevermind and hung up. He could have told me in the beginning of the call that they closed at 11, there was no need for the attitude. 
NEVER AGAIN will I call here!"}
{"text":"First, time I tried this local business, I ordered at 440 pm, they didn't acknowledge until I pressed the delivery company, Slice, if they received my order. Slice did a great job of communicating. Finally, got an answer at 510 pm, that the order would be delivered in 75 minutes, what, it's already been 30 minutes. Well, it finally arrived at 535 pm. It was horrible, the pizza is soggy, partially raw in the middle and the 6.99 onion rings, that made sound like they were freshly made, are straight out of a box! Well, never again, just disgusting. All for 33.00+,wow. Buyer beware of this business."}
{"text":"I am so torn with this place.  They have awesome food, but whoever answers the phone has the WORST attitude ever. Like, I'm sorry you work here, but all I do is order some food.  I don't need smacking of the lips and hanging up like you have a better call to make.

The food on the other hand is so good! Their pizzas are way different from any of the main pizza chains here.  I would love to go back, but I hate supporting places that don't appreciate their customers.  My friend called to ask how much pizzas were, and he said he would call back to place an order and the lady hung up after call back. I really have nothing more to say about this place. Good food, but awful customer service."}
{"text":"Hands down one of many best pizza places in Vegas , all locations are owned by the same people so you can trust in them all tasting the same , Nellis as Harris an the Henderson one on warm springs are the locations i usually go to. The wings are amazing everything is so good.. if you have a huge party i here Highly suggest grabbing the 30\" pizza you won't be disappointed.. must have if your in the mood for pizza"}
{"text":"Ok... I decided it's been 6 months and I would try it again... Ugh, why??? I wasted my calories damnit! Again, the pizza was cold. They literally advertise FAST DELIVERY, well I ordered my pizza at 4:21 and it didn't arrive until 5:57!!! COME ON!! By 5:42 I was ready to call and cancel my order... But I was friggen hungry. 

The pro- I love the big pieces of garlic, that's really good. 

Not worth it. I give up on this place. Such a bummer."}
{"text":"Pizza is good, antipasto salad is average, everything else is overpriced crap. Never ordering from these guys again. Seriously, if you have any talent in the kitchen, don't order anything other than pizza. First & foremost, if you're an Italian restaurant and call the lasagna \"classic,\" that shit better be good! I'm Armenian and can make better lasagna after 7 hits of acid, 5 King Cobra 40's and 2 eight balls of blow...and I'll still remember to remove the bay leaves from the sauce. The pastrami sandwich was dry and didn't come with cole slaw or French dressing like the menu says.  The order of medium boneless wings were probably frozen. Potato and pasta salads were made by somebody who got canned from Smith's deli section. You've been warned..."}
{"text":"These guys are cheapskates. 
I ordered for pick up, and just before my wife gets home with the food I get a call saying we got the wrong bag. So he asks me to bring it back, so my wife took it back. He asked her if she wanted a small soda or something, so my wife replies with no we don't drink soda can I get a salad. And he says no no no no salad, so he gives us an extra cup of ranch. Such bs if you ask me I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Pizza is always great and customer service is on point ! Yana is the best ! Me and my daughter come here at least once a week for pizza night and she loves it !"}
{"text":"NAPOLI!! Pizza itself is 3.5 stars because I'm in love with Grimaldi's pizza but I give this place a solid 4 stars because they open superrrrr late into the AM and does deliveries and has been suchhhhhh a lifesaver time and time again. The boyfriend and I eat pizza from here religiouslyyyyy. We get it delivered like 3x a week sometimes. All times of the day. Napoli makes ordering easy with grubhub. I recommend ordering the 4 topping pizza. We always get basil, sausages, olives, bell peppers. Greatest combo. I honestly don't know what we would do without Napoli. It takes an hour from the time of ordering to be delivered and we live less than 10min away. Thankyouuu for your existence Napoli when we're starving at 3am or when it's Sunday football and we're glued to the tv."}

{"text":"Horrible I barely understood what the man was trying to say he sounds like Robocop or like Arnold Schwarzenegger well when they showed us the pizzas  we noticed the burnt crust so we asked them is it burned underneath the Robocop man said I would not let you eat it completely burnt well the pizza was chewy and the crust was burnt i told my family this is the worst experience in pizza taste i have ever had we spent over 100 in wings pizza and pasta well kids eat everything but it wasn't good enough to finish it all they left one whole pizza 2 were burnt one was good I will not go back unless he refunds all my money back my name is jose my number is 408-463-8850 or if he apologizes ."}
{"text":"Napoli offers delicious pizzas with the crust burnt just right.  We have decided to add Napoli to our pizza joints circulation.  Tonight's special was a large pepperoni pizza and twenty buffalo wild wings.  We also added a dinner salad, for a total of $30.  Needless to say, the pizza and wings were delicious.  And don't think that Napoli doesn't know how to make a good salad.  The bed of lettuce was covered with red onions, peperoncini, black olives and tomatoes.  Yummy!

Come give Napoli a try and free yourselves from name-brand pizza joints!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Turkey Burger with Fries, and because I was starving I went ahead and splurged for a brownie. I ordered through EAT24 the delivery time said between 45 & 75 minutes, I figured it might be a while, so I wasn't concerned. It did take almost 1 & 1/2 hours, but the delivery man was so very nice and polite. The Turkey Burger was HUGE, I loved it, the fries are really good, and the brownie hit the spot. I'm normally not a big eater, but this was great and well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"If you are hungry and want to eat pizza don't go to this place because you will starve to death for almost two hours of waiting. Not only that the staff are rude and keeps on making you wait... they say 15 minutes more... the pizza is coming out of the oven... it took two hours for the small pizza to come out of the oven... this place sucks and will never go back in here again... neither will recommend it to others...if there is a zero star i will give it a zero... the pizza is not even that great that is worth the wait..."}
{"text":"Ordered a half Napoli Special and half Greek pizza for delivery. Both were good but Special was much better. Never thought I'd say this but Greek may have had too much going on with toppings but I still enjoyed the flavor. Also ordered a side of wings and zeppoli's for dessert. Wings were very average and I'm very picky about a quality wing and first bite was an unusual hunk of gristle and I noticed my wife doing the same with her wing. Overall, loved the pizza and will try agin based on pizza alone but Angelina's for the same order is probably a little better value."}
{"text":"Bad service. They need better management to help customers. The lady took my order was very kind. When the delivery was supposed to arrive an hour late the driver did not know my address I asked him what was my address on the paper he said my correct address but still did not know where I lived?! It's the little things they keep people coming back I will not call the store if I was starving in the desert"}
{"text":"I ate Napoli pizza at work yesterday for lunch with my co-workers. I had a slice of sausage pizza and part of a calzone with pepperoni and onions. I liked it but thought it was veryyy greasy. I should have used a fork and knife because by end of finishing my hands were covered in grease. It's not the worst pizza I've had but because of the grease its not my favorite."}
{"text":"Always having lunch there it's great but sometimes when they're busy they forget about you on the table. So to avoid that mess of an rush hour, call your order in.  and your day will turn out to awesome sauce. I really enjoy this restaurant"}
{"text":"Customer service was poor. We walked in & there was a table full with a family but the rest of the tables were empty of customers but boy were they messy. No one was cleaning tables. On top of that the lady at the counter was rude. She talks low so when I ask her to repeat herself she gives this attitude in her voice. 

The food was pretty good as in the pizza & the wings. But the veggies they provided were wrapped in foil as if they just put them together & tossed them quickly. Not. Wry professional in that matter."}
{"text":"Oooops sorry! Wrong napoli!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible. If you're going to tell a customer it's going to be 10 more mins until the order is ready then at least be real about it. Yet, after 10 mins , it's now another 15 minutes on top of that. I'm hungry, angry, & now they lost my business."}
{"text":"Ended up canceling our order because they were such a**holes. 

Tried ordering online, but it said that they did not service our area, even though they delivered the flyer to our door. Since we had the same zip code, I figured I would call.

Call began with, \"Please hold.\"  CLICK. No hello, nothing. Bad music. Came back within a minute, went downhill from there. Told her about the online experience, she said she's not sure what went wrong, but they do in fact service our area. Literally spent 30 minutes simply trying to convey our address. She had a problem listening, kept interrupting, never got it right even after multiple spellings and repeating the cross street. The actual pizza order was easy, until I mentioned the freebie on the flyer they sent me. 

Flyer promised \"Free garlic balls if you text\" - with no caveat. It is a bait and switch. They don't mean it. No free garlic balls. She rudely put me on hold, then a man answered. He went into a song and dance about how the text wasn't working correctly and I was supposed to follow a link to download their special app and then come into the store in order to receive their stupid less than $5 incentive.  I said that if you're willing to argue that much over something so cheap instead of just giving it to us as first time customers, it wasn't worth being customers at all. We ended up ordering from dominos."}
{"text":"Super disappointed with the food now too. It used to be good so we could tolerate the bad service but they are bottom of our pizza list now."}
{"text":"The pizza and wings here are amazing ! I ordered the #4 which is pizza,pasta, garlic bread, and a 2 liter soda. The pasta was terrible the 2 meet balls they put in there had a very plain taste to it as well as the noddles where sitting in a watery sauce. It's a good place just have to know what to order"}
{"text":"Food was GR8! Had a supreme pizza and garlic balls. Delivery was on time and quicker than expected! Food was hot, so no complaints here!"}
{"text":"I love Napoli's food, they have the best pizza and wings. We love the Alfredo pizza it's soo bomb and the mild wings are the best. I want to try the Parmesan garlic wings next time. We even tried the gyro salad which was pretty good, but I probably wouldn't get it again.We usually do pick up and have never ordered togo, but this time we felt like ordering delivery. I made the order at 9:40 and didn't receive our food till 11:20... It was ridiculous how long it took. I could have drove there faster then it took. Our food was luke warm and the delivery guy was rude and seemed very annoyed and in a rush. I will never order delivery ever again."}
{"text":"Yesterday must have been my 20th trip to Napoli Pizza . My friend had the lunch special steak sandwich with fries and unlimited refills drinks , I had the lasagna also with unlimited soft drink.
The food was 5 ***** stars, as always. Service also gets my highest rating. The lunch specials, I think there are about 24 to choose from are only $7.99. Best quality deal in town. The lunch specials run from  9 AM to 3 PM."}
{"text":"Probably the last time I'll order from them, as convenient as they are for being open late and delivery has no cut off time. They have made me wait for the second time for 2 hours. They deliver my food that had my missing desserts not only that, I had to call and make sure my order was being sent out. They have very terrible service, even when it's downtime."}
{"text":"The food is decent. But you feel robbed. I would eat there more often but each time I order they have changed the pricing. Today we got the pizza special $8.99 but the fountain drinks were over $3 each! This was take out so it's not like there were refills. And the cups are only 20 ounces. I tried to order lunch to be delivered once, with the delivery fee it was well over $20 for 1 person and the wait was an hour and a half. I was so disgusted that I told them to forget it."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place, so was excited to finally try it.  My experience did not turn out well.  I had the 2 sausage slices with a drink for $5.99.  The Dr. Pepper was flat.  That's fine, sometimes places have issues with the fountain, totally understandable.

Well, more than 20 minutes after ordering, I had not received my 2 slices of pizza.  I came around 12:45.  Later during lunch time, I'll grant you, but still the common lunch period for a restaurant.  It's not like I came at 2:50 asking for the lunch special.  There were only 2 other tables with customers seated (so it wasn't crowded), and no one came to tell me there was an issue with my order.  So, I went back to the counter and asked.  The employee didn't say anything, but went to the back.  I was then told by another employee that my pizza was coming.  

My pizza was brought to me, and I was informed they had to make a fresh pie for my order.  That would have been fine, I'm certainly not going to complain about freshly made food.  But, an apology, or letting me know it was happening, anything would have been appropriate here given the amount of time it took to fill a very simple order.  The slices are ENORMOUS.  It's a crazy amount of food for $5.99.  Just enormous.

But, there were a few problems with the pizza.  First, the topping distribution was off, with about 70% of the toppings being located on the lower 1/3 of each slice.  This slipping could have occurred when they were putting the slices on the plate, so that may be understandable.  But, the bottom was not crispy, except in places (near the top) that it was burnt.  So, I did not get the good crust that you typically get with thin crust pizza (and is the reason I prefer it to deep dish).  Finally, it was undersauced significantly.  I'm guessing they hurried in the back making it, but each little mistake added up quickly.

The menu is diverse and some things looked very good.  I may try to order some pizzas to go next time we have people over and want pizza for dinner.  But, my lunch experience left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for pizza wings and fries food is good family loves it too. People are nice... dine in or take out always the same quality."}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza place  in Las Vegas. Three hours for an order, no apologies, crappy placement, and it's Luke warm. It sucks it sucks it sucks"}
{"text":"Ordered an XL meats pizza ... Nearly had to tilt on its side to fit box through my doorway.  It was huge & delicious! Even better re-baked the next day for lunch. Best crust around. There was plenty to feed 3 adults for 2 days. 

Tried a Large the 2nd time and it was pretty big too, still had leftovers. Can't imagine what the 30\" monster looks like!

Zucchini sticks appetizer are pretty good. Wasn't in love with the breaded mushrooms or onion rings, seemed too greasy & overdone. 

Despite the 1.5 hr wait time for delivery, this is by far my favorite neighborhood pizza place so far. Will definately be trying other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"They have always been rude and arrogant, but the pizza has been pretty good at a fairly decent price.  After tonight however, they've lost my business.  I had called in for pick up and was told my order would be ready in 40 minutes.  I showed up after about 35 minutes with no one in line but the 4 folks at the counter must not have been able to see my red shirt and 220 pound frame cuz it took a minute or two before they allowed me to pay. 25 minutes later the food came out; one of two pizzas wrong and the fries for my wings were thrown out as soon as I got home- cold, rubber, inedible by anyone's standards.

After alerting them to the mistakes with no apologies, the correct pizza(pepperoni) came out and was BADLY cut in no uniform manner.  Again, no apologies and when I tried to talk to the guy behind the counter, he walked of mumbling in what I believe was an Eastern European accent.  I've gone to these guys for a few years, but sad to say I've had enough of the rudeness.  We are not going back again."}
{"text":"I was making a delivery pizza order on a Saturday night...sounded like a young lady answered the phone with an accent. I was staying at my buddy's place so was new in town. When she asked me what main street my buddy's place was located at, I said I wasn't too sure because I don't live in the area. She started to chuckle and laugh at me in a disrespectful manner. I asked her why are you laughing over the phone, which she still continued to laugh. Who laughs to customers like that...so because of her I decided to cancel the order.

Management: train your subordinates not to laugh at customers, you will lose business, just like tonight!"}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've had Napoli. I forgot how great the pizza is. And the fries are amazing!! I had ordered using Yelp Eats, which is very convenient. Service was great when we went to pick it up and the food was done right on time. Will start coming back more often."}
{"text":"When I'm craving pizza, this is where I go. Napoli's menu is huge! They have everything for everyone!

My husband and I usually order whatever their text club special is or we get the carry out deal which is a large one-topping pizza for $7.99. My husband loves the sausage with black olives. I usually get the large Chef Salad. It's filled with turkey and ham. Lots of veggies too!

The staff is always friendly and they seem to have enough people that you don't have to wait forever.

They have several lunch specials for $7.99 or less and are open very late for any night owls out there."}
{"text":"I just ordered some food tonight from Napoli. This is actually my second time ordering from them. The first time, while expensive, the food was awesome. This time, everything was terrible. First off, the girl that took my order was extremely rude. the food was very expensive, and when I got it, everything tasted terrible. My order was as follows.
#14- Lasgana for 2, salad, appetizer, 2 liter soda, garlic bread and 2 desserts.
The lasagna was mooshy and oily and the meat was pasty. The appetizer(fried ravioli) had no flavor and was cold. My garlic bread wasn't toasted and was mooshy with no flavor. 
We called them back to actually get our money back, because there was no way we were going to eat the food. We paid $40 for it, and expected it to at least be edible. Not only are they giving us the run around, but they are being extremely rude to us(said girl that took our order). We are still waiting for the manager to call us back. They told us they can only exchange our food. why would we want to wait another HOUR for food that we might not even want to eat. Overall, this experience was terrible. Save your money, and order from Boxers! Now they're awesome."}
{"text":"Best Fresh, Quality Pizzeria!!!!! We order the Caprese Salad and it is the best I've ever had (I just ordered 6 for myself & co-workers, it's so good).  The balsamic vinaigrette is amazing, the entire salad is fresh & flavorful. The service is always great whether we dine in or have it delivered. Check this place out, it is worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Don't order from or eat here! Napoli was our favorite pizza until today! We have ordered Napoli for Years! So on 4/14/18 we ordered pizza, mozzarella sticks, and a 2 liter, it was delivered about 1 hour after we ordered, we found the one pizza was incorrect in the order, and the cheese sticks were over cooked to the point were all of the cheese had melted out of them and we had breaded empty shells and for the second time now, no 2 liter came with our order. I called and spoke to a staff member explained the situation, and he told me we had to return the food and he'd send new food out, I told him it was very late and we would just like a credit for the large order of mozzarella sticks and he 18 inch 2 topping pizza, and the 2nd two liter. He told me \"no problem\" said he would save it under my phone number and I could redeem it any time. So today 4/30/18 I called the Napoli at 1275 W. Warm Springs and wanted to place an order and also redeem the items we were owed. I was placed on a brief hold and spoke with \"Harry\" who was immediately condescending and told me \" sorry it's not in the system and I'd now, we are both pretty good and there's no credit for anything\" I explained the entire situation again and he then told me \" well the night manager is Harry, we are both Named Harry and he wouldn't forget so there no credit here\" I said well then can I order, to which he replied \" look call back tomorrow and talk with him, maybe he forgot and he will remember ok\"? I told him \"no it's not ok, but I'd like to order and redeem the items your store messed up and forgot\", he stated \"sorry there's no credit\" I asked him \"so I can't order any way\" he stated \" No call back tomorrow.\" At which point I said \" No it's cool, I'll never call back\" and hung up. I have never had such incompetent treatment from anywhere here, ever! So I went and reviewed my bank statement to see how much we actually spend each order and how much so far, we averaged 50-70 dollars plus tip on ever order, a minimum of once a month and max of 2 times a month over that last year. A yearly total of about $900.00 we used to spend at Napoli. Most of that was at the other Napoli, only since moving to this side of town have we been eating and ordering from the Napoli located at 1275 W. Warm Springs Rd. I was treated so rude and with the insinuation and disrespect that we will Never eat at or order from this Napoli ever again! Great job Harry for being a rude demeaning \"day manager\". I'm sure Napoli has competition that will treat us better and do well to profit from our orders and our purchases from now on. I will tell everyone I know and come into contact with to avoid this location permanently. I award negative stars if it allowed it."}
{"text":"Good looking location. A pizza place you could sit down and relax while you enjoy dinner. They have wine and beer, and a large menu of non pizza items. The pizza is not what I call 100% New York style, the crust was a little too thick and the sauce to cheese ratio was off, but I'm super picky about my pizza. The rest of the group really enjoyed the pizza. It reheated in the oven really well, so plan on extra for some leftovers."}
{"text":"The sausage pizza/mild wings combo was really good. We also tried the spicy sauce which did not play around. My brother is a fan of hot sauce and he really preferred their sauce over BWW. I recommend the fries every time which are sweet and crispy. Overall bomb lunch food. Still need to try more of what they have but I definitely liked their pizza wing fries combo"}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place has so much business. If it weren't for the fries and ranch,  I wouldn't be coming here at all. 

The service is horrible, the phone etiquette sucks, it takes FOREVER to get your food, the way the seating is laid out is crowded, and the food is soooo salty that I wake up multiple times throughout the night to drink water.

This is Vegas. You can find way better, real \"Italian\" food places here besides this joint."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I was having a party and they delivered 5 delicious different dishes to my door. They came at the time that we agreed upon the day before. I have had the lasagna, baked ravioli, and their pizza and they were all very well prepared and my guests loved them all.  
Definitely give this place a try, if they're busy, that's because they're doing things right."}
{"text":"Pizza might be good but wait is Hoooorrrrible. Not sure what the point of ordering for pick up if you have to wait another (few cuss word)  hour when you get there! Waste of my time!"}
{"text":"Never again.  We ordered the stromboli and appetizer combo platter.  The person on the phone was nice and answered all my questions. However, the surly delivery driver was the beginning of the end for me. I wasn't expecting much from the combo platter (fried foods typically don't travel well) but I wasn't expecting inedible. Gross. The stromboli was salty and greasy...it was 3 toppings but I could only detect 1. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from these guys for several years now. Since before they moved to this location. We have never had a problem. We always do carry out. usually get pizza wings and the antipasta salad. Very good and fresh tasting.I"}
{"text":"I'm updating this review for SURE.  I was way, WAY too generous before.  Each visit has gotten progressively worse, both in service and in product quality.  I have gotten many a cold pizza, which is unacceptable when you're the only table in the place.  I don't even know how that happens, unless you forgot about me or you're handing me someone else's crusty pizza that's been sitting around for a while.  Eww.

Sure, it's cheap and huge, but it's also greasy and pretty soggy.  If I eat things that are questionable in the health department, I tend to just pick at them and eat smaller portions.  At Napoli, I actually feel that guilty feeling in the bottom of my stomach when I eat.  

If you want to try a local chain that also delivers but has a higher quality product, try Boxer's on Boulder Highway.  The service is friendlier and the food is infinitely better."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and great Ranch dressing.   Attentive customer service.  Great specials and they want to give you the best deal.  Ordered an 18 inch pizza and they asked how many people it was for to determine whether we should order a 16 inch and save money because of the special price on it.  They asked several times about refills on drinks."}
{"text":"Ordered a French Dip for delivery. When I received my order I noticed that all of the Dipping Sauce had spilled into the bag. Sandwich was still good though. They could probably be more cautious when delivering food however."}
{"text":"Best place for straight up buffalo chicken wings,  exceptional portion of fries and a drink for $10. Totally worth it,  you'll be fat full and happy without breaking your pickets.  Check them out for sure!!"}
{"text":"So, we were super hungry super late and gave in to Napoli cause their wings are so good. The person on the phone was actually very pleasant and our order was correct! I'm glad they made those changes. We've ordered twice now and it's been perfect!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Napoli's pizza for little over 3 years since I moved here in southern Nevada. Their pizza is great, but their \"HOW WINGS\" is to die for.  I always order 12 pcs of wings just for my self and a large crispy fries and it's over, I'm done, I'm out!"}
{"text":"If you do the pick up special its a 16\" pizza with one topping for only $7.99. 
The pizza is a bit greasy but yummy.
The pizza is also big a 16\" probably feeds 4 or 5 people.
We also got an order of fries that are good and crunchy.
The service does take a while,  when its busy is takes them about 40 min but that's because the pizza is made fresh to order. 
Inside they have tables and tvs so you can enjoy your pizza while watching tv. It is a bit noisy inside but still good.
Overall the pizza is good I didn't put 5 stars because the guy who took my call was a bit rude with saying my name and would but me on hold a lot."}
{"text":"Terrible. Ordered a pizza via Yelp online, estimated 30 minutes. I called ten minutes after the order, and the employee confirmed the order, told me it would be more than an hour, and then hung up on me before I could respond. Called again, she hung up again cutting me off mid sentence. Called again, she patched me over to her manager mid sentence, who was confused Why I was on the line. Told me that he couldn't waste a pizza and that it was in the oven. Defended his employee for hanging up on me multiple times, and lacked empathy. Told me there was nothing he could do to stop the order and to cancel via Yelp. Told him that if the service was any indication of the product to not deliver the pizza. Nightmare. DO NOT ORDER A PIZZA FROM THIS LOCATION. Pizza should not be this hard and the lack of leadership and service is baffling."}
{"text":"Pros:

*HUGE menu with everything... popcorn shrimp, calzones, wings, sandwiches, italian food.. it's a calorie laden junk food fest
*prices are decent, $2.99 for 20 garlic balls.. yum

Cons:
*delivery took an hour to Henderson
*food is just *ok*. I liked the chicken caesar salad and garlic balls, but the fi didn't like the wings, and the calzone was soggy by the time it reached us. 

Verdict: I'd give them another try.. apparently they are open 24 hours, so that's pretty cool. Seems like a good place to order from if you want delivery from not your average pizza joint."}
{"text":"Ordered through GrubHub first time for this Napoli Pizza. We will not order again. The food was not good.  I ate most of my salad which wasn't bad compared to the rest of the dinner. If I made my spaghetti it would be fantastic to what theirs taste like. I couldn't even finish it.  They really need to improve their cooking. I don't recommend eating here or taking out food from here. I tried it and can not give a good opinion for bad food."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the Customer service is the worse I've ever seen anywhere !!! I spent $50.00 for Pizza & salad, and he couldn't even say Thank You ?? He went to the back and got our food & handed it to me and went back to watching TV I said \"Thank You\" and he says ahhh huh and never took his eyes off the TV. They have to be the rudest people I've ever dealt with. I will never go there again !!"}
{"text":"+ Ordered delivery, said it'll take an hour and 10 mins, our food arrived within an hour. 

+ Garlic balls are cheap and tasty. 

- Pepperoni pizza was too oily. 

- Lasagna was salty and had no lasagna noodles. 

- Would not recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in Las Vegas. I first heard about Napolis about 2 years ago and haven't ordered from anywhere since. Everyone I have recommended come here loves it. The pizza is always fresh and delicious, the appetizers are bomb, and I have never been disappointed eating here."}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars if possible... Got wife's order wrong and made us wait to give back the food saying it had to be untouched. Would not even offer a refund and refused  any compensation whatsoever. Waiting for correct order to get here while the rest of our food gets cold. Terrible service would not recommend.

Edit: Delivery guy comes back 30 minutes later and order is still wrong. 

Stay away they won't get your food right and service is terrible!"}
{"text":"Don't quickly believe all of the negative reviews about this restaurant. In my experience from the two and a half years I've been ordering from them they will bend over backwards to help you. I usually order from them through Eat24 and only one time have I ever had any food that wasn't up to expectations. I called in the manager instantly gave me credit for the next time I ordered. the salads are exceptional. the Italian sodas are sweet and tasty. The pizza is absolutely incredible."}
{"text":"I give the stars just for the food being decently good. But not good enough for me to want to bother ordering again. I received an email at 8:24pm on a Monday night nonetheless. My estimate delivery was at 9:39. And when I called about 15 minutes after I placed my order he told me it would be an hour to an hour and 10 minutes. My delivery didn't come till 10:15pm. When I called at 10:10 to complain he assured me 5 more minutes that he should be there at any moment. I called back just as he yells about his driver being at my home. Not only was the customer service bad but for him to not even apologize to make up for the hour and 50 minute wait time he just made sure he made a point about his driver being there within his 5 minute window. So disrespectful. Assuring me my food will be hot and fresh doesn't justify a horribly late wait time when their location is ONLY 16 minutes away. Nothing is worth that, especially when they don't even try to make up for it!"}
{"text":"Nice because it's open so late & delivers. However....... I called to place my order around 2:30am & they gave me an hour wait time, so I was okay with that. An hour & 10 minutes passed, still no pizza. I called and the lady said the driver was 7 minutes away. 15 minutes passed and still no pizza. Called back and they offered me no discount or anything which I think after 30+ minutes late that's what they should have done. pizza arrived around 4am! The website & the damn pizza box says FAST DELIVERY. Completely false. Food was okay, but personally not worth the long wait. Probably won't order from there again."}
{"text":"Best pizza and salads in town! Have ordered a few times and the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"The one star is for the CJ's Italian Ice they carry. The girl who took our order was SO rude and should not be in customer service. We had never been there before and were looking at the menu, NO ONE was behind us  but she definitely didn't want us to dine in. When my husband order she says \"are you sure you don't want the 18 inch CARRY OUT special?\" is that what we said we wanted? She SCOFFS at us after we wanted the bigger one. She was so condescending and rude. It was so bad I thought we were getting punked! Like a real life Bon Qui Qui. Maybe it was her terrible mullet haircut that gave her a bad attitude or the fact that she's 40 and working at a pizza place. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"After being referred by the hotel .. We waited over an hour for our pizza ... So the delivery guy came to the room and right before he left we opened the box and the pizza was wrong no toppings . So I called and I was put on hold for over 5 mins then I was told that the toppings were put on the pizza... Are they invisible toppings?  they proceeded to tell  me that they would make us another pizza .... Ummm no we are extremely hungry after waiting over an hour for the wrong food ... Because we felt bad for the driver I have him a $20 and said thank you... If we lived here or not this pizza joint needs better customer service and better communication w

I'm giving one star because we actually got a pizza it was ok probably because everyone was so hungry DO BETTER"}
{"text":"Upon discovering Napolis pizza and their 7.99 one-topping pick-up/dine-in special I stopped going to little Ceasars for those pizza nights and faithfully switched over to them.  Their pizzas are one of the best I have tasted in Las Vegas, so much so I put up with their terrible customer service.  I raved to everyone I knew about Napolis, that is until one unfortunate day.

I ordered a pizza and chicken wings.  I picked them up and they were both cold, and I excused them, again (like their horrible customer service) thinking maybe I had taken to long to get there to pick up the food.  But my guests at home weren't convinced, they said the pizza tasted more than a few minutes old, they said it tasted like hours old.  I ignored them,  and then, I bit into the pizza crust only to find a strand of hair cooked right into it...  Another one of my guests found a foreign object on the pizza, like a fiber from a cleaning sponge...  I was so mortified.... 

I called Napolis and they offered me a refund, only for the pizza, that's ok, but I never received the refund.  Not only that but I got sick to my stomach, for a whole day, I was really sick.... I am pretty sad, but I am never stepping a foot in Napolis again."}
{"text":"I ate here for my niece's birthday on Sunday. Everything was hot, and tasted really good--But this time there was a hair on my sisters pizza. She wanted to complain but every one in the family was already eating and my sister didn't want to wait another 25min. The food is excellent, but no one wears  anything to protect their hair from falling into the food. My sister should have complained so that they know that this is happening often."}
{"text":"We decided to order from Napoli again tonight.
This time we ordered Boston Clam Chowder & Cream of Broccoli soup- both were good and came with saltines.
Next: Hot Subs -
Philly Steak and Sausage & Peppers Parmesan  Both served with Fries. Again, very good! Marinara served on the side so no soggy sandwhich upon arrival! Yaaaay!
Dessert: Brownie and Carrot Cake. Sorry but these were just-Meh...a little dry but not horrible.
All in all it was A LOT of food. We couldnt eat it all so leftovers tomorrow.
I added an extra star because the delivery time was greatly improved! I was quoted about 1 hour 10 min, but our food arrived in about 35-40 minutes. Much better! Keep that delivery time reasonable and you will get more of our business. 
Thanks Napoli Pizza !"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite late night snack locations to go with my friends. The hot wings are perfectly crispy, the pizza has he perfect texture dough and don't forget to order fries because even the next day when they're cold they're still PERFECT. plus they're open like all night and have amazing prices. Plus a million drink choices. Idk as a straight Italian girl I can be kinda harsh on \"Italian\" food but this place is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"So I want to give this place 7 stars because they have zeppoles (and amazing zeppoles at that!), which I've found are hard to come by outside of NY.  But unfortunately I can't rate an entire restaurant on those, can I?  My husband ordered a meatball hero and fries, which he said were both awesome.  The garlic balls are delightful and, did I mention the zeppoles?  LOL.  And the prices are totally reasonable!  Now the not-so-good stuff: pizza was too salty and service was questionable at best.  We waited a long time for food to come, and when it did start coming, we waited longer in between each item!  Also, it came out in kind of a weird order.  Zeppoles before meatball hero before garlic balls before pizza?  I was so confused.  Our fault for not specifying \"appetizer, meal, dessert,\" I suppose.  I noticed a family who came long after us had food before us!  Anyway, the prices and the zeppoles will keep me coming back and for those reasons you should give it a try too!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good long as the delivery driver makes sure it doesnt shift. And when you get it the cheese slid to one side. But that only happened once. The cheesesteaks and fries are delicious. And I recommend trying a italian soda. The Zeppolis arent on par with Villa Pizza but are still delicious. And their delivery times. They quote you a time and show up quicker which is awesome when youve been drinking and are hungry. Plus they remember you by phone number so you dont need to give your addy each and every time. AWESUMMM."}
{"text":"The wait is long, the food is inconsistent, but still one of my favorite after hours or late night pizza options! Their carry out special is best value"}
{"text":"I happened to be in Henderson for some training for my work.  One of the guys in my class went to Napoli's and got the two slice and soda lunch special for $5.99 yesterday.  I was intrigued so I went today.  I was there looking over the menu for a few minutes before anyone ever acknowledged I was there.  I guess the fact that the restaurant had very few patrons in it at 12:30 PM on a weekday should have been a sign to me this wasn't going to be a great experience.

The girls were on the phone and talking to each other in some European sounding language (maybe Russian).  Once I was finally asked what I wanted, I was rung up and asked if it was here or to go.  I told her \"to go\".  She then filled up my soda in a glass.  I reminded her it was \"to go\".  She asked \"are you sure?\"  I said \"yes\".  I even checked the receipt to see how she rung me up.  Good thing, too, because I paid her with a $20 and she only gave me change for a $10.  I pointed out that I had given her a $20.  She opened up the cash drawer to check and I guess she saw she had no $10's in the drawer because she then peeled out ten $1 bills and handed them to me.  She told me to drink the soda while I waited for my pizza to cook and she would give me a to go cup.

While I was waiting, she came by and gave me my \"to go\" soda cup.  I thanked her.  When my order was ready, she asked me if I wanted more soda.  By this point, I was ready to leave so I told her \"no thanks\".  As I was leaving, she called me back and asked me if I had only ordered the two slice and soda meal.  I told her \"yes\".  I wasn't sure where this conversation was going at this point.  Maybe trying to make small talk since they seemed rather cold upon initial contact.  The girls were nice enough to look at, but their customer service skills were VERY lacking.

The slices were huge and the amount of toppings were sufficient, although I have had better pizza.  Don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.  Still seeking that one magical pizza place in the Vegas valley that can keep my return business."}
{"text":"Our last order from Napoli really changed our views on the restaurant. Previously we'd have pretty decent service and the food was always excellent; we always were aware that they were going to be about 15 minutes later then they said for delivery.

We ordered off of their website yesterday and were really disappointed in the delivery service. We placed our order online and got a confirmation email at 6:18pm. We figured okay, it'll probably be an hour until we get our food due to past history. 7:18 rolled around, still nothing. We decided to wait a little longer, finally calling at 7:38pm. They told us they couldn't find our order and put us on hold for ten minutes. When they took us off hole, they ask for our confirmation number, phone number, and address. Then they finally said they found it and it would be about 45 minutes until they could deliver out food. 

However, they did give us a discount to apologize, so I will say that was nice of them to do. Our food got to our house around 8:40pm, so we were pretty hungry at that point. Their food is always really good which makes me sad about the whole delivery thing. The white pizza is excellent, their boneless wings as really nice (there isn't all breaking and no chicken), and we tried their garlic balls (which is just dough with garlic and herbs and marinara to dip in) which were decent. But the price of them was worth it for sure.

I'd highly recommend their pizzas for sure, but maybe just pick it up yourself."}
{"text":"They suck, saggy pizza, undercook wings and dirty, snhd will visit them now ! 

Basic hand washing doest exist"}
{"text":"We have been going to this place now for a couple of years and the quality and service has been going downhill. Our last 2 delivery orders were cold and after contacting them, just a simple \"sorry\" will not happen again. Yeah right... Would not recommend this place anymore!"}
{"text":"I was so hoping that this place would be good, but it sadly is the opposite when it comes to pizza. I ordered a New York style cheese pizza and a Greek pizza. Both were just 'blah'. The New York style cheese pizza was a wanna be and was nowhere near the incredible taste of straight cheese New York pizza. It was edible, yet overlooked and bland. The Greek pizza was so heavy with garlic that that was all that one could taste! It was dreadful. 
Will not be ordering from here again.
Very expensive for quality of pizzas and delivery time average."}
{"text":"I work for a local car dealership and we have a hard time figuring out what to eat for dinner every night.  Napoli has a $8 pizza for carry out that tends to feed about 3 people.  
The pizza is good and the deserts are great.  Another great pizza place that is a great value for the locals."}
{"text":"Still the best pizza and wings ever! Every time I want to impress my family especially my husband I go to Napoli!!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in Pittsburgh, great staff great food!!   Very good action-packed salads, great spaghetti and meatballs, great pizza, and the delivery driver is at the top in his profession!!!"}
{"text":"Just received a brochure in the mail and wanted to try out this place.  When I ordered over the phone I couldn't really understand the balance because of their accent but I wanted to make sure to take the brochure with me to verify the pricing.  (Note: we just moved to a new home) on our brochure we received the 40 piece wings where $27.99 ..when I get there they are $36.99 (big difference!) the pizza was $8.99 ...when I added the price it was 39.99 with the tax included and when I get there ..because she mentioned the priced changed a month a go..so the price was $49.73 when I get there. I paid for the full amount but it was kinda of irritating when I asked if I could get the price the brochure mentioned because we couldn't of received our brochure a month ago.  When it's only been 1 week from the time we got the new mail..huh mmmm I will say never again!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and order a pepperoni and garlic pizza. The taste is superb. There other food is good too. The buffalo chicken salad will not disappoint. Infanct anything they make that has the workd 'buffalo' in it is good from Napoli. Don't be afraid to try the tuna, it will delight anyone that isn't into peppery prickly tuna. Bottom line, order from here and you'll have a great dinner."}
{"text":"Consistent, good quality, fast efficient service. This place doesn't disappoint. Tried the party pizza special w wangs n fries! If your hosting and you don't feel like cooking and it's Sunday or Monday night game, this is a go to move! Got the pepperoni & meatball n honey BBQ on the wings... Don't forget fries added for a buck..."}
{"text":"Disgusting!!!! I was so upset because I always recommend Napoli to some of my hotel guest. I decided to eat order delivery late one evening and it was absolutely disgusting. Delivery guy was very kind and on time. I ordered the lemon pepper breaded wings and they were un-edible! The sauce was terrible and was like nothing I even seen/tasted before. I couldn't believe the cook actually boxed the wings for a customer to eat. I also ordered the shrimp scampi which was flavorless and the shrimp was rubbery. I am a firm believer of it's normally the cook/chef and not the establishment. I will order again but NOT late at night!!!"}
{"text":"Last night my friends and I ordered Napoli's Pizza. The experience was overall good, but not perfect. First off, when I called to place the order the guy was very friendly over the phone, however he told me 30 minutes and when I got there I ended up waiting about an additional 20 minutes. One thing I was amazed at was the amount of food you get, I only paid $33 dollars and got 2 small pizzas (for anyone who has never seen a Napoli pizza, their small is basically the equivalent of every other pizza places large!), an order of garlic balls and a two liter. Even though I had to wait the extra time, it was totally worth it! The garlic balls were soooo yummy!! And the specialty ranch pizza was DELICIOUS! I am a huge ranch fan so this really hit the spot and the chicken they put on top isn't crappy out of a can chicken, it's crunchy and yummy! As for the pepperoni pizza, it was good, nothing special, just your average pepperoni pizza. If you are going to order Napoli's, I'd suggest getting a specialty pizza!! The only reason I docked a pint was for the extra wait, really I would have only taken 1/2 a point, but that wasn't an option haha. Anyways, I would definitely suggest Napoli's Pizza to anyone who is craving some great pizza!"}
{"text":"HOLY BEST PIZZA IN HENDERSON.... Seriously so Yumma!!!!! I love it!!!! And the garlic knots are game to....my BFF bought like gallons of the ranch too...."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Not as good as it was about 8 years ago when it was right next to Green Valley High ."}
{"text":"The pizza here is amazing, you can order the 30\" pizza when you are having a party and still have leftovers. The nice thing about this Bulk style pizza they serve is that you get quantity and quality, we ordered the greek which was amazing, green olives, feta cheese and chicken. most large party size pizzas we have ordered in the past have been dry or they get all chincy on the toppings, this is not the case here, You get exactly what you order and if i may say so myself, the leftovers are even better than the first day!"}
{"text":"Burger was good, which I find funny because I didn't order it (also, it was burnt along the outside, I just tore that part off...very hungry). I'd tried to order their Reuben, only to get a call a half hour later, letting me know they didn't have it today. The pics of the food are VERY misleading, they had to be taken off the internet...or back when they made quality food or something...it certainly doesn't look that way now. Ingredients are completely different even (like the kids Mac and cheese was nacho cheese and thick, cold noodles-the pic is in no way similar to what we received) Everything else I ordered was overcooked and somehow cold. The fries have this very odd, very strong flavor I can't pinpoint.  Don't order delivery. And if you must try it, order through a third party, it's the only way you'll get a refund on the horrible food. My family and I are throwing away four full boxes of absolute trash."}
{"text":"*sigh* 
Where do I even begin? I could start with the pizza...but I suppose I'll begin with the appetizers as those are suppose to be eaten first. Friday the hubby and I decided we wanted to try something new and had seen their commercial on TV and so begin our downward journey. Called in to the place an order and the girl who took the order rushed us through and even snapped when I tried to repeat my order. I should've taken that as a warning to cancel my order but we continued. Our order:
Pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni 
Calamari
Mozzarella sticks 
Garlic bread with cheese

Uhmmm first of all, I've never seen calamari look like a fish stick. It was tasteless with a rubbery consistency. I ate one piece and ended up throwing the rest away. 
Mozzarella sticks...you could tell they were just frozen and not fresh as the chess didn't even melt when we bit into it. Another waste. 
The garlic bread! The only reason why I'm giving this place a star and a review. The garlic bread was actually good and a good price.
The pizza... =\ so greasy and tasteless...and it had no sauce. wtf? It was dry, but oily on the surface. Complete failure all around. Nothing had any flavor to it. 
This was an overall disappointing meal. I will not be going back for a second chance. No use in wasting money there..."}
{"text":"A word in advance, this is based entirely on the delivery, I have never been in the store: 

I just moved to the area and I will probably not order from here again.  My first time ordering the pizza was AWESOME.  Not overly cooked, and just great.  So ordered from there the same thing a second time and the pizza was really bad.  It was cold, and very hard (almost like biting into cardboard).  So I figured everybody has a bad day and ordered from there for a third time.  This time I got the breadsticks, the fried mushrooms, the jalapeno poppers, and a medium cheese pizza.  The pizza was cold and tough again, the mushrooms were cold as well, and the breadsticks were greasy and terrible.  The poppers were pretty good though, but I imagine it was cold because it took over an hour and a half to arrive.  So I think my first time was the rare occurrence, but if you do get one of the days where they are \"on\" the pizza was great."}
{"text":"For new York/New Jersey style pizza this is the place to go. Similar to nj the slices are huge and the interior Italian like. The staff is friendly, service is fast and the pizza is fresh. Really fresh.even slices come from whole pizzas that area freshly cooked in the back.No leftover old pizza being served here. 

As for the pizza itself it's huge, with puffy crusts and tons of cheese. If you get a topping they are also generous with those. The lunch special is two huge slices and a drink for 5.95 plus tax, you can't really beat that. The slices alone are the size of a small pizza. 

Every time I come here the staff Remembers me and are very personal.I've enjoyed finding this place and getting to know the staff and trying their different pizzas, as I've never been disappointed. I come back here as often as I can because I love it!"}
{"text":"A great little place to stop for lunch that is tucked away in the Miracle Mile parking lot in Monroeville. Has a constant flow of people but have never been super packed for lunch, at least when I had been there. There is nothing special about the dining room, but at least it's clean..

This is one of the only places around that sells pizza by the slice in a thick and thin crust style for under $2. With the addition of a long list of side dishes, you can order yourself a nice little meal for under $5!! Plus did I mention the pizza slices and side dishes are huge??? That's a definite bonus. 

But this place doesn't stop there, you can also order full pizzas and family sized portions to bring home with you to enjoy in the comfort of your very own dining room! From pasta to pizza, hoagies and more- this place has such an extensive menu that this place has something that everyone will enjoy at a great price!"}
{"text":"What can I say/post. Let's give it a try..

The Good: They are one of the only 24 hour delivery places in bad areas of east/southeast Vegas. Their garlic knot balls are pretty good and only 3 bucks. Their marinara for said balls is also good.

The Bad: Hmmm. Where to start.. Their pizza is LITERALLY on par with Cici's buffet, at best. If you compared this place to say..Gramaldi's, you would say there's no way Napoli could even spell \"New York,\" let alone came from there. The mozzarella is the same type used on Little Caesars. For what they charge, it should be better quality. Authentic, quality moz forms little \"puddles\" or areas on the pizza. Low quality doesn't taste the same and is stringy and forms a solid layer across the pizza.. which is alright if I'm drunk.

They charge $4 for a 2liter of soda. Hahaha, yep. FOUR dollars. It's a marketing ploy, obviously. A lot of their \"Daily Specials\" come with a 2 liter soda included, so you think that's a \"$4 value\" you're getting. Naw. Your getting maybe a $1.50 value.

Ordered the large salad. For the price, should have meat. Whether chicken or salami/pepperoni. Nope. Just wilted lettuce, tomatoes, and 2 pepper. Their ranch is the think stuff you have to dig outta the container with a spoon or knife.. not the good buttermilk ranch that runs all over the salad.

Ordered the sampler platter. Substituted fries for the zucchini sticks. They acted like they were doing me a favor, when in reality, I was saving THEM money with the switch. The sampler was 75-80% fries. Barely any of the other stuff.. and the breaded mushrooms were filled with HOT water and squishy rubber mushrooms. 

Understand, there's nothing here that tastes home made. I'm from the Midwest where sauces are made from scratch, breaded appetizers are beer battered, and the pizza uses quality cheeses. 

Check out my other reviews. I'm not picky. I'm just picky about wasting my money. 

On a side note, their chicken wings, which are one of their \"specialties,\" are halfway decent. I honestly like Albertson's wing kiosk better, but these are ok at Napoli's.. just don't get the garlic wings. A little to soaked and soggy for my liking.."}

{"text":"DO NOT EXPECT GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE (they never smile and always rush you and can be forgetful with drinks) ... 

BUT what they lack in service they make up for in DELICIOUS FOOD. Expect long waits. Order ahead... Make them repeat your order, pick up or dine in, but not delivery. I've going for years and only once was I given a smile at the Decatur and Sahara location.  She made our day and got a nice Tip :)"}

Great specials daily for lunch and dinner"}

They always have great specials daily 
The manager is always friendly and accommodating with large walk in parties and altering the food if you want it a certain way. 

Love it"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Loved the pizza here and the service was amazing. We are not from the area but found this place while in Henderson. It's the perfect pizza place to go to if you are hungry. The small pizza is more than enough for 2."}

{"text":"Our office had received Napoli's menu in the mail and were exited to try some of the lunch specials located on the back of the menu. We set a date to order for the office the week following receiving the flyer in the mail. We ordered 2 lunch specials, both priced at $6.99 on the menu. I was made to repeat the order several times to the lady on the phone (who was not particularly nice). I was then given a price which seamed a little higher than i had anticipated for 2 lunch orders. Upon verification of the prices, she explained that the lunch specials that i had ordered were $7.99. i explained that i had just received this menu circular in the mail the previous week. She stated that she would provide our office with a new menu and then went on to tell me that the order would be delivered in an hour, which was perfect since our lunch break would be at that exact time of delivery. (ordered at 11:32). I decided not to haggle with the pricing and left it alone since i understand pricing does change without notice.

A little over an hour later and 5 minutes into our lunch break, our food had still not arrived. I called back and spoke with the same lady who had taken our order. Before checking on our order status she started to brush me off by stating that it takes an hour for delivery. I stopped her and explained that it had been that long already and explained that me and my coworker are allowed a limited amount of time for or lunch. She then huffed and stated she would look to see when our order was placed to make sure it had actually been an hour. After verifying that , yes, it had indeed been OVER an hour she began to check on the order status and explained that it may be about 7 minutes more before we would receive our order. 

I spoke with my co-worker who agreed with me that this was way more trouble than it was worth, not to mention by the time our food would arrive (given it would arrive in \"7 minutes\") we would then only be left with 10 minutes to eat. I called back and then spoke with a gentleman (may have been in some sort of manager). I began to explain the situation with the menu pricing, he interrupted me and stated he would give me 5 dollars off my order. I explained to him that at this point we would just like to cancel our order and i did not feel that $5 would justify such bad service. He did not seem to care either way at the loss of a customer and hung up. I later noticed on the menu they advertise \"Fast Delivery\", yeah that's a complete joke!"}
{"text":"Got a flyer with coupons in the mail. I'm all about saving a few bucks so I kept it remembering that my sister has been craving some pizza for days now. So I called and placed an order for their special, which is a 16\" pie with one topping for pick up only for $8.99. I also ordered 10 spicy honey bbq wings and an order of cinnamon zepolis. My total was $24 and change. Now we are from the East coast. From NY so we know some good pizza. I must say this is some good pizza. The wings were also really good!! Zeppelins were over rated. Will be my new fav pizza spot."}
{"text":"Roaming the streets, we struck out on the first three places we tried to visit for dinner. Establishments we found on Yelp were all closed for good. A sign caught my eye, with lights shining through the windows, Napoli Pizza! My co-workers go to the one by work all the time and rave about it. This one had to be good too, right?

We walked inside, and started looking at the menu. Deciding on what we wanted, we started to order. The cashier took my order easily, yet when my wife asked what was on her pizza, the lady had to look at the menu, then ask someone else. This may have been because she was new, who knows. We won't knock that too much.

There were a couple staff members just sitting by the counter while their compatriots were busy with customers. There were two tables already eating, as well as a few phone orders that were coming in while we were there. It did not look crazy busy though, just a nice steady flow of business.

We paid, received our drinks, sat down and continued our conversation from earlier.

10-15 minutes later, my pizza came out. Not a strange occurrence,  as between the pizza and little stand, the staff member's hands were quite full.

I was halfway through a large pizza before another staff member came near us, she made the effort for customer service to offhandedly ask how everything was. She was lucky to have asked without fully looking at our table, as the rage in my wife's eyes would have burned a searing memory into the girl's soul, and my wife replied, \"know where my pizza is?\" or something along those lines. Of course, the immediate answer was, \"oh it should be coming out in just a few minutes. This was already a good ten+ minutes since I had my food.

It was almost 45 minutes (total) before they got her pizza out!!!1! They forgot to make one of the two pizzas on our order. As I said, they were steady busy, but busier screwing around (appeared that way anyhow) than making sure orders went out right.

The pizza tasted alright, maybe it would have been better if the bitter taste of rage did not creep into our minds. 

We may give another Napoli a chance again, but this one is on our avoid list."}
{"text":"This place used to be a lot better. Last time we ordered the meat lovers Pizza it was a disappointment, it was so greasy even the kids wouldn't eat it. I'm willing to try eating something else one more time, but I will definitely not be having their meat lovers Deluxe pizza anymore. The fries are pretty good, the wings are pretty good."}
{"text":"Service is terrible however they more than make up for it with the food.I always get pizza and wing dings they are amazing. DO NOT believe their estimate time if they are busy."}
{"text":"The best greasy pizza in the Las Vegas Valley. I order their pizza often for my shop and the staff here loves it.

Treat yourself to some delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend because I'm new in town. It was alright.  I've definitely had better. I'm not a fan of overly cooked food, esp my breads and I ordered the garlic balls and the bottoms were overly burnt and the sides were almost as darkened. That destroyed my appeal in those.
The pizza was greasy, but I'll do. I probably won't pay for another eating here, but if I happen to be at a friend house (the one who recommended it) I wouldn't not eat it."}
{"text":"Ordered 18\" five cheese pizza and a Caesar salad and the lady said it would be 45 minutes for delivery. Cool.   Food arrived an hour and fifty minutes later.  Not cool.  

Pizza and salad were average.  I'll never order from here again.  Two hours is too long to wait for a pizza.  

Why in the world are you putting flyers on my door when you are six miles away??"}
{"text":"I just moved to the 89122 area here in Vegas and it seems that there is not much to choose from when it comes to delivery. So I decided to give this place a shot and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the 5 cheese pizza which was very tasty. I also ordered the zucchini sticks. very tasty as well. So far I have ordered from Napolis twice and I have yet to be unsatisfied with the food. 
The only downfall and complaint I have is that delivery time can take up to an hour plus. so if you are not in a hurry to get your food then you won't have an issue! 
I will continue to order from here. Next time I will try something different!"}
{"text":"This place is the best of the best! I mean anything off of the menu is always outstanding. The pizza is the best in town. There unique sauce, fresh cheese and toppings is comparable to none. Sandwiches are always HUGE and incredible. There wings always hit the spot seeing how they even make there own wing sauces!!! Its always busy meaning the food is always fresh and prices very fairly!  This place is one of the hottest spots in town! No one can compete!"}
{"text":"IF ONLY I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS. 

Lot's of other places on Grubhub for pizza, I won't make this mistake again!!

There was a mix-up w/the order I placed w/Grubhub, I cancelled the order almost immediately, because I noticed after placing the order that there was a nearly 200 minute wait.. I ordered at 10:45AM. There was not enough time to even cook the food before I rectified w/Grubhub and over the phone w/Napoli Pizza. Both assured me that my order was confirmed and would be delivered in under an hour. TWO HOURS LATER. My food arrived. Cold, rubbery and WRONG. I asked for Mayo, none and no packet or anything, just cold dry chicken and stale bread and some hour-old provolone. I ordered a side salad w/Caesar and they gave me fries, which at this place is a mixture of curly/regular fries?? This would have been ok, if the order was hot/fresh. The worst part is, I placed my order at 10:45. Someone at my company placed the order at 11:30.. my food showed up w/theirs. So, obviously it sat for AT LEAST an hour, to save them a trip.. even though we BOTH paid separate delivery charges AND a TIP."}
{"text":"I always eat here with my family,  love the pizza. If i had to choose i would eat in cause i like my pizza piping hot out the oven pls lol.  The wing are also good i used to do hot cause spice is Life but now we do medium cause its easy to enjoy."}
{"text":"A friend of ours told us about this place... So we decided to check it out. And OMG I'm glad we did. The pizza was AMAZING the staff was friendly. The size of the Giant pizza is huge!! All ingredients are fresh and the crust is cooked to perfection  My husband and I will be a repeat customers!!!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place 10+ years ago by a flyer under my hotel room door.  For the past 10+ years I probably order from here about half the time I go to Vegas, which 2-3 times per year.  I've had both delivery and dined in, and the pizza is great!"}
{"text":"Normally Napoli is just ok. Tonight, I just spent $71 on 2 pizzas and 1/2 bucket of wings. Holy crap, are you kidding me?? What disgusting food. I feel so cheated. Not only was it stupid expensive, but gross and not worthy of Pizza Hut. Not only that, it took over an hour for delivery. I'm SO pissed. Too bad there are no negative stars."}
{"text":"My family and I came here in hopes of discovering a new pizza place to visit. As far as the food goes, I was very pleased. The pizza can get a tad bit greasy but any napkin can take care of that. I recommend the Napoli special, which was what we got. The service on the other hand, could've been better. We sat down outside for a little over a half hour and still didn't receive our pizza. We got excited when the waitress approached us with a pizza but we were let down finding out that it was the wrong one. We then waited another 10-15 minutes and finally got the correct one. It was delicious and the people working here were very friendly and supportive. It was a Friday when we came here so business was a little hectic involving the take out orders, so we were forgiving. Overall, it was a good meal, but I recommend ordering it for take out instead of sitting down."}
{"text":"Just OK, it was kinda greasy and the sauce was bland. Size was great."}
{"text":"Only Pizza Place opened on Easter Sunday for lunch.. Good Pizza nice staff very clean. Apps came out cold but they fixxed it with no questions.. I would come back again.. Pizza is very good and affordable."}
{"text":"Food: The Italian Pizza was very good. Full of garlic flavor. My only complaint was that the crust was a bit on the tough side. Not crunchy, not chewy; just a little tough.

Service: I would have given them 4 stars if it weren't for the bad service. It took over an hour for them to finish my take-out order (1 pizza and a side of garlic balls). Also, the lady at the counter was not very friendly. In fact, one of the other patrons called her a certain 4-letter word that rhymes with \"hitch.\"

Ambience: It was nice. Felt like a tiny little italian kitchen.

Special Note: I do recommend their pizza, but make sure you call it in 1 hour ahead of time."}
{"text":"This pizza place is definitely one you must go to! 
Huge slices and great flavor! 
My favorite pizza place in town!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is not bad but it is certainly not what it was years ago.  We ate at the Monroeville location two different times recently and the men's room had a very strong smell of urine and was pretty much filthy.  I tried not to imagine that the men's room was where people making the pizza were washing their hands after using the toilet."}
{"text":"I love this place has some damn good pizza. This is my new go to pizza spot. ?mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Really good pizza. 2x slices (HUGE) 2 topping and drink for $6.... Adding this place to list of delivery options."}
{"text":"I've come here a few time from Cali on business had no issues always friendly pie's always consistent."}
{"text":"The pizza is good. The wings and fingers are good but average relative to any other pizza joint. Everything is ridiculously expensive for what you can get just about anywhere. The Philly cheesesteaks suck. They're skimpy as hell on the cheese. I even have paid extra for extra cheese and it wasn't any better. The picture they have of the sandwich posted is false advertising at best. Oh! 

\"Hey it comes with fries all in one packaged box so the steam keeps your fries nice and wet, let's throw some pickles in there too! Wet pickle fries and a hard roll with a tiny scrap of meat and cheese would really top it off!\"

Again pizza is good but overpriced. Wings and fingers are average and also overpriced."}
{"text":"My husband accidentally took my car keys with him to work, and we hadn't gone grocery shopping yet. So for lunch, I decided to order delivery. I've been wanting to try Napoli's for a while so decided on that. I ordered their chicken strips and fries, an extra ranch, and a 2-liter of coke.

I placed my order about 12:10pm. I didn't get my food until 1:40pm, possibly closer to 2pm. Seems a little ridiculous on a middle of the week day but whatever.

GOOD:
My order was 100% correct which surprised me. Usually deliveries always result in them forgetting something.

My food was hot, ranch was homemade, and the Coke was cold.

BAD:
The delivery man seemed very upset and eager to leave me. If I hadn't already tipped online, I'm not sure I would have tipped him as well as I had.

The chicken and fries were definitely not made by them. I've tasted this exact brand of chicken tender and french fry before. What's sad is, they weren't even good. The fries  tasted like reheated leftovers from the night before. The chicken was over cooked and hard to chew.

I ended up throwing away my meal. Wouldn't order from here again. Only gave two stars instead of one because my order was correct and the appropriate temperature."}
{"text":"I've been coming her for over 8 years. It used to be my family's weekly pizza spot. Their food is pretty good and they have kick ass fries and hot wings! The hot wings will have you tearing up. However, if you don't mind your meal being completely destroyed by the terrible customer service, I would recommend this place. They're open LATE which is convenient for me when I get off work late. But, as you can see from previous reviews, they don't improve their attitudes or service towards customers. It's sad to see a business with potential to be great but their employees/owners WHOMEVER consistently act like they despise working and serving there."}
{"text":"Ordered a pepperoni pizza. It was good a little on the greasy side. So much grease the pizza started to fall apart.  Also got two off the bottles sprites and they were past there expiration date one sad Mar 2014 and the other Sep 2014. Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have always had good luck with these guys. They deliver until like 2:30 AM and generally have your food to you within the hour.  Pizza is always great.  Nice crust and cheese, and the toppings are of a decent quality.  Great sandwiches too, I love their Philly Steak.  You really can't go wrong.  Don't expect gourmet, but for how late they are open vs. quality of food, you really can't go wrong!  Been ordering from them for 3 years, and have no plans of stopping."}
{"text":"Called in and placed an order for a pizza delivery, I questioned the lady (she did not understand English good at all) taking my order regarding the total price of the pizza, she asked if I wanted to cancel the pizza after I stated the extra charges were too much, and I clearly told her not to cancel it.  I waited at my home for 1 hour and 15mins only to call back and find out that she cancelled my order. I found this out after I was originally told that my card didn't go through and that they tried to call me twice.  Just a lot of lies and poor customer service. I'm overly frustrated with the staff at this restaurant and will never order from them again."}
{"text":"Last time I ordered from them I got wings that were tougher then boiled boots and about as meaty as a hummingbird. never again plus they are really kind of bitchy on the phone too."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Napoli many times. I usually order the Napoli Pastrami sandwich. The first time I ordered it, it was awesome. The last three times I've ordered it not so much. It's supposed to be pastrami, coleslaw, provolone, and french dressing on a roll put under the salamander. The last two times it's had meat and cheese only..so bland and dry.. For the prices they charge, the food should not be slacking!!!! I won't order from here anymore!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with Napoli today. I was so looking forward to my \"birthday pizza\". I ordered an eggplant sub and small pie.  There was virtually hardly any sauce on anything.  I had ordered a sqare pie before and it was really good. 
This trip was a \"no go\" for me. 
Not a great way to celebrate my birthday."}
{"text":"It was delivered within the time frame they gave us, so that was great.  The delivery guy was nice.  However, the pizza I ordered was supposed to be 1/2 meatball and feta.  I got 1/2 shaved meat and ricotta mess.  If you look at the photo, it really looks awful.  It was watery and just honestly turned my stomach to look at.  The other half, made correctly was better.  The crust however is dry, some people like that, we don't.  The sauce was alright.  It was better than the sweet stuff some shops have on their pizzas but very stingy on the cheese.  Overall, not our type of pie. The order taker was courteous."}
{"text":"Order some calzones with some co workers there were burn to make it worse the guy said it's ok there still edible they were very rude did not bother to apologize like seriously would you eat burn calzones forget this place and I hope there reading this"}
{"text":"Horrible sauce, pizza was burn and service is very poor.
All items are overprice for the poor quality you get.
The service two thumbs down. I used to live in New York and you get really good NY style pizza for half of what I paid here. I don't mind paying the price but give me good quality food and service, on this day I didn't get either.
I'll not return to this place."}
