{"text":"Yea it's cheap, but I'm not kidding when I say that I found a piece of thick hair as I was almost done eating my $7 Pad Thai. It was a long strand of black curly hair and I swear it was a pube. It was disgusting and I immediately threw the pad thai away and almost threw up. NEVER ordering there again.   Don't waste your money here, and get a better quality pad thai."}
{"text":"I haven't had any issues with pricing, service, or anything else.   They always say it will take about an hour but I usually get my food in about 40 minutes (and I am about a 7 minute drive away). This is my favorite delivery place, hands down.  The thai basil rice is a favorite of mine; the portions are huge, and they have a wide variety of options in both Thai, Chinese, etc.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????    The service was the best from any Chinese restaurant I've been to in the US and I live in LA. Owner made me a custom dish of vegetables and the flavor was fantastic. Thank you Sichuan express!"}
{"text":"Coming from Los Angeles, there's many authentic Sichuan restaurants. I am also born and raised in Chengdu Sichuan so we know what the authentic dishes are and what they are supposed to taste like. Sichuan Express captures every aspect that I  expect from these dishes. Their dishes are tasty and spicy, which is what we love. I highly recommend coming here if you're in the mood for not only authentic Sichuan food but also Chinese food. Also the servers are extremely considerate and can help you pick what to get if you need help. I will definitely be coming back here in the future."}
{"text":"Extremely poor customer service. There was a lady in front of my friend and I who asked for the price of spring rolls. She got ignored by the employee who were taking orders. She asked again and was coldly told by another employee that they don't sell them individually but then out of the blue the employee taking our order says $1.99 in a very rude tone. Of course the lady who wanted the spring rolls walked away. $1.99 for a spring is absolutely ridiculous, you can go to an Asian grocery store and buy 10 for the same price! Anyways as the lady was walking away, the employees behind the counter were giving her the dirtiest look and talked about her while my friend was waiting to order.  She paid little attention to my friend when she ordered because she was busy talking about the lady and keep eyeing her. Very unprofessional. All the ladies behind the counter are extremely rude, maybe except for the cashier.   There are way better options at the food court ie. Maxim, Ruby Thai (amazing service), Muncho Burrito and Amaya.   I do not recommend this place at all. I have never seen someone be treated this way just for asking the price of something."}
{"text":"We decided to come in for Szechuan Chinese food, but then we noticed that the menu had Thai items. We asked where the chef was from, Thailand or China. Turned out that the chef is Thai, so we decided to try Thai rather than Chinese. I ordered Massuman Chicken and asked for spicy, then the chef's special Jungle Curry, which was too spicy for us. My husband told the waitress to make it the way the chef would eat it. Then it was unbearably hot. I'm not a spice wimp, but Thai spicy is too spicy for this girl. The Massuman chicken was perfect, spicy enough but not too spicy. The portions were HUGE. Just one dish would have been enough. We had ordered spring rolls (three in one order), and iced tea. I had Thai iced tea, while my husband had the regular iced tea. Huge mugs came out, and I even got free refills of my Thai iced tea. Amazing value. We ended up taking home the huge portions of curry and rice. Very authentic. I don't know how the Chinese was, but the Thai food is great."}
{"text":"Great new Szechuan option. Very authentic. Try the cold appetizers (not on the menu) and the spicy boiled beef."}
{"text":"Food here was good. Really can not complain. But it was a little pricey for chinese food in my opinion. Especially because the portions were kinda small.   Service was ok. If you could get their attention they were very friendly and helpful. The problem there lies in getting their attention. There were only two tables when I was there (ours and one other), yet it still took for ever to get someone to look our way. They seemed to be always preoccupied either staring back into the kitchen or just staring out the window.  Overall it was still ok. Decent food."}
{"text":"I was surprised but the food here was delicious! Better than traditional Hakka places I've tried in the city. The food here does really lean towards the spicy side."}
{"text":"First few times, it was great. But then....I got orange chicken. I was shocked the orange was bitter and rotten.  My son this week was sickened by the shredded pork. Cheap but not worth the agony he suffered."}
{"text":"This place stays true to what its menu says: \"small price you pay, large portion you get.\" It is by no means spectacular Chinese food but it's great for a quick meal. The guy who works the cashier is very friendly, the service is quick, and the selection is enormous. The General Tso's Chicken and Yang Chow Fried Rice are my favorite dishes."}
{"text":"Good enough for the price, some might think the food is too salty or greasy, but for me it's just kind of sweet and not spicy enough..."}
{"text":"very good? best Szechuan food! Like real Chinese style! Yummy!  HahahahahhahahahHhHhHhhH"}
{"text":"I personally feel the ready-made stuff is legit pretty bad and overpriced. It tastes nothing like Szechuan food! It is more of a typical westernized chinese food made to match the local palate. However...  What I do think is worth ordering the the made to order noodles. You line up on the right side (there are two separate line ups) and you can order the type noodles, either with soup or without, paired with protein and veg. This option tastes much better and you can save a couple of bucks for a latte instead."}
{"text":"worst food I've ever eaten! after 5 hours finished this, still want to throw out, cannot stop drinking water. Stay away from it!"}
{"text":"The food is big portion and very good food. The Thai tea is amazing! The owner is very friendly."}
{"text":"My favourite place in the food court. The short rib noodle soup is a must try and it's even made to order! I love the general tso chicken and sesame chicken. The portions are big so I always have leftovers too yay. I've also been to a few of their other locations downtown and their quality has always been consistent."}
{"text":"Ordered from here for probably the second or third time. The food took 1.5 hours to be delivered. I ordered an shrimp egg roll and beef with garlic sauce.   The shrimp egg roll was actually pretty good but the beef with garlic sauce was absolutely disgusting. It had an almost jello like texture. Far too sweet and mushy to be even called food. So disappointed as I eat ANYTHING and I thew mine away. Add that to the 90 minute delivery time, and I wished I had saved my money."}
{"text":"Lovee their food, i got the mushrooms and general tao which had a nice crispiness on the outside and tasted like real meat unlike many other similar restaurants. They give pretty big servings and its really satisfying, im hooked!"}
{"text":"Try the authentic menu!  I have to admit, the first time I tried this place, I didn't like it.  The huge portions and low price was great, but the food was mediocre. But that's because I ordered from the americanized menu.    If you want great General Tso's chicken, go elsewhere. If you want more authentic chinese food, turn your head to the left and read the fine print English translation of their authentic menu. It is absolutely fantastic, and hard to find this type of food in the Burgh."}
{"text":"A great dinning experience all around. Everyone was friendly from Anita the owner to the waiter. The food was excellent. Highly recommended!! Many wonderful dishes to choose from. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"CANT TAKE ORDER. OR MAKE ORDER CORRECTLY. WONT REPLACE WRONGLY MADE FOOD.  I will never order from this place again. placing a delivery order was like pulling teeth. the person on the phone needs to learn how to communicate better. After 5 minutes of trying to get my phone number right we were finally on our way to placing a pretty basic order, or so i thought. We tried to order house special chicken combo plate and pad tai from the tai menu with no spiciness. after a hefty hour of waiting we finally received our order. and to our surprise the pad tai was obscenely spicy. Because i work in the food service industry i understand mistakes can be made in the ordering process  but can and should be ameliorated pretty easily. Well after calling them up and expressing my dislike of the food the person on the line said they would send another one. But after another 30 minutes of waitting we receive a call from this place and the person tells us that its our fault and they will not be sending another order. They also commented that they thought we would be ok with the spiciness level because we had also asked for some chili oil, but after explaining to them that the oil was for the other dish they became defensive and continued to say that it was our fault. Needless to say I will never be ordering from here again. Placing an order is beyond difficult, and if order is made incorrectly the staff would rather blame the customer for their mistakes, rather then owning up to them and accommodating the patron."}
{"text":"If you're in search of spicy Chinese food this place is for you! We tried a few other places and this place won by a mile. If you like Dan Dan noodles you will love this place. Also the intestine pot was amazing. It comes with potatoes, okra, garlic, cilantro, and cucumber. This place tastes amazing. Give it a try especially if you like Hunan or Sichuan food"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best Chinese restaurants in town! Their Chinese Eggplant in Claypot is amazing and a must order!!!!! If I could, I'd give them 6/5 stars!"}
{"text":"It's so bad. I order a Chinese egg soup noodle. However, the shrimp is so small and not fresh. The tomato and vegetables like uncooked. It seems like they are hurry to let u done."}
{"text":"Craving one of my old haunts, I decided to stop by Szechuan Express today. This place used to be one of my favs back in the day.  Now, not so much.     I called ahead and placed a to go order for their Szechuan chow mein, which typically contains beef, pork, chicken and shrimp.  No complaints about the chow mein.  It was tasty just as I remembered.    However, now I remember why I stopped frequenting this place... two reasons.  !) For the longest, they would not accept calls from blocked numbers.  I would get so annoyed when I tried to call them that I would just hang up and call Best Hong Kong (which is literally two doors down) instead.  Apparently, my call went through today so I think they finally wised up. 2) The place has a funny smell to it.  I'm almost tempted to  describe it as a stench.  I would never choose to stay and eat there.  Strictly, to go only.  The place is very small anyhow with only a few small tables with chairs (smaller than my living room),  I know they deliver but I hate delivery.  Can't comment on customer service since I ordered to go.  I walked in, paid cashier (who said hello and thank you) and walked out. Food is decent (3 stars); decor/smell (2 stars)."}
{"text":"We usually get the family meal! It is a great deal and good variety. Rice is always cooked right and they deliver too!"}
{"text":"I am not a frequenter of hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurants, so I have not much a basis of comparison, but Szechuan Express is pretty good.  I usually go with the Teriyaki chicken, which comes with a Teriyaki sauce that is very tasty and different from a Teriyaki Bowl type of place. My wife prefers the Thai Curry Chicken.   We usually do take-out, though they will deliver. The store does smell funny (read that in another review), but the people are really nice.   Word of caution:  avoid the Wor wonton soup."}
{"text":"The couple's sliced beef in chili sauce is very authentic! I'm pretty sure it's cooked by Sichuan chef."}
{"text":"Dang, girl.  I was bowled over by the Tom ka soup. The yellow curry with beef is great. The egg fried rice is full of scallions, eggs and peas. The delivery was quick, and the food is cheap with consideration to its quality."}
{"text":"Greasy cheap chinese food. Ordering was a bit confusing. It seemed like there's about one employee who speaks English. You get a big styrofoam box of whatever meat and vegetables you order, with a lot of rice underneath. Everything runs around five bucks. So lots of bang for your dollar. Food was prepared pretty quick. I certainly wasn't wowed by the food, but it was fine. If I was drunk it would probably have been revelatory. Food was expectedly Americanized. The decor is kind of dumpy. But this isn't a place you go for atmosphere anyway."}
{"text":"Food is good , but price is on the high side in my opinion . I would go back more if price is little cheaper !"}
{"text":"The place is small, cramped, dark, and dirty. However, they have cheap food and large portions (enough to last me two to three meals). If you order in Chinese, they give you an extra discount. The food is made really quickly--under five minutes, usually.  The food itself isn't that great. Everything is either too greasy, drowning in sauce, or both. Also, I wish they'd fill the boxes with less rice and more of the entree. I've had the beef noodle soup, which is flavorful but greasy. Both the beef and broccoli and chicken and eggplant dishes had too much sauce. I rarely go; usually, I bring people here only because they're curious about the cheap Chinese food."}
{"text":"In my first day in Toronto I wanted to get some good old Chinese fast food, but to my disappointment Szechuan Express had very cheap and bland food. I tried their wonton noodle soup and everything about it was bland and had no flavor. It tasted something they sell at a very low down buffet restaurant. The food they sell their was very similar to their noodle soups. Everything has pretty much no taste, hopefully other tourist will just go to a McDonalds instead of this."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the poor reviews here... I think Szechuan Express is above average for the type of place that it is. It's definitely on the pricer side, but I find their food delicious - it always seems to be (again, for the type of place that it is...) fresh and served hot, with great variety available. Most importantly, it'll keep you full. I may pay $12 for chicken, veg, noodles and a coke, but I know I'll be full for the rest of the day - or taking half of it home for dinner.  I've always found the staff at this location friendly and helpful.  I generally go after the main lunch rush though - maybe that helps explain my positive experiences."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get Thai in the valley. I have tried so many and none come close. Takeout or delivery... their staff is gracious and accommodating.  I have been eating here for 8 years and have always had  the best experience."}
{"text":"New renovated food court in the Royal Bank tower.. Szechuan Express is one of the many food places repeated thorugh the PATH with many locations.  Ordered Fried rice and Crispy Beef.    Wow.. the food was worse than Manchu Wok, for the money you pay there are much better options in the PATH."}
{"text":"I have to change my review of this place. The food is good. The service is horrible. I come to this place a least a couple of times a week. Today the cashier, I'm not going to say her name but it begins with a J.  She is really rude. She treats people who are Cantonese speaking in a very disrespectfully.  I see her treat Caucasian customers and theirs who speak mandarin with extra nice. I seen this myself and with a friend of mine who spoke mandarin to her and there is a big difference.Today was the worst with her she deliberately severed someone else before me even though I was ahead of them in line."}
{"text":"I'm definitely NOT going back.  The main ingredient in all of the dishes was H2O.  They watered down all of their sauces robbing all flavor from the dishes.  I've gotten more flavor at home from a bouillon cube than this place.  We ordered crab rangoon, mongolian beef, and orange chicken.  Instead of getting that thick sweet and sour sauce with the crab, we got pink tinted water with no taste.  The mongolian beef should have been labeled mongolian onion because that was the main component, and the sauce was thin and watered down.  The orange chicken was over cooked, dry, and tasteless.  No complaints about the rice though.  I'll be going back to Tsing Tao next time.  There I can count on the taste and quality of the food."}
{"text":"The best Thai food ever!!! I've been looking for authentic Thai curry chicken made with coconut milk like my friend used to make me and am sooo excited I found it tonight! They were so nice and delivered fast and the food is amazing!!! My kids loved the orange chicken! The sticky rice and mango was so good! Thank you Szechuan Express we will be ordering again soon! Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Writing this review as I stare down at my uneaten meal. This place is pretty gross.  The line moves quick and it's very hard to decide on what you want - I originally ordered a combo with noodles and 3 items, but the servers are inattentive and only care about rolling through customers, so they only gave me 2. I ended up with the lo mein, bok choy & sesame chicken.  First off, everything here is more or less deep fried, which had I known in advance, I probably wouldn't have come here for lunch.  The lo mein is disgusting - completely overcooked and in pieces, and has a putrid fishy smell to it. It's making me sick. The bok choy is slimy from the sauce, but tastes decent. The sesame chicken would taste much better if not deep-fried.  So many better options around here - AVOID."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating Asian food. If you're like me and enjoy eating Asian food, you can do better than this place, especially for the price. I had the Lo Mein noodles, 1 veggie & 1 meat which came up to $11.30. This is fine, you're downtown afterall.   I get back to my desk to have my lunch and Meh. I didn't really care for any of the food. First, the Lo Mein noodles were soft and mushy. I like my Lo Mein noodles to have a bit of a crunch to them, I don't want them melting in my mouth that isn't what Lo Mein noodles is supposed to be about. The rest of the meal was kind of enjoyable, that is until I looked down at the food and found this pubic hair staring at me -.-  I ended up throwing 2/3 of this food out, but I wouldn't have eaten the whole thing anyway."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place only has 3 stars. The portion sizes are amazing, the food is cheap, and it taste good. The line can get long but your food will be out in no time at all.   It does look sketchy from the outside but the food is amazing."}
{"text":"yes I was a poor college student. some days i had spare change and this is the cheapest spot to go for chinese in Oakland. the place is dark and gloomy, covered with pictures and menus of foods but long and behold the food comes out within 5 minutes. yes, the food comes out looking like it should be for pigs BUT hey when you're hungry their to-go boxes are filled to the top (sometimes overfilled that the sauce leaks out) everything on the menu is great except the noodle bowls there's too much noodles and bland broth"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried hotpot in this restaurant during our trip in Vegas and we both think it is one of the best Chinese hotpot we had in US, even better than lots of hotpot restaurants we tried in New York. All materials are fresh and the soup is not oil but very tasty. The owner and waiter are very friendly even though we came in late and stayed after their closing time. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Mediocre, but not bad and didn't make us sick.  I had crab puffs and sizzling rice soup, which were both okay.  Crab puffs were nice and crispy, they gave us a ton of them, but they were a little on the sweet side.  Sizzling rice soup had good broth and good rice, but almost nothing else - few veggies and only 3 piece of meat.  BF had dumplings and moo shu pork.  The dumplings were standard - pan fried with an odd dipping sauce.  Moo shu was 90% cabbage.  Anywhere you get moo shu, there are a lot of veggies, but this was seriously just cabbage.  A few babboo shoots here and there, very skimpy on the pork.  The flavor was okay, though.  To sum up:  Go there if you're in the mood for a quick and decent meal, but don't expect to be amazed."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"If I wasn't on a diet, I would eat Szechuan Express twice a week! I love their food. The people working there usually seem to be friendly (I have had one mean cashier, but  think she was just having a bad day) The place is small, so I wouldn't eat there, but it is definitally amazing takeout! I live in Tempe, but will gladly travel to mesa for some good chinese food!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! I didn't expect a decent service from here since it is just a Urban eatery, but the servers were really rude!! I got stared and rolling eyes from an old lady who worked there simply because I wanted to change my order from \"eat in\" to \"take out\"! The food does not worth the price. Worst quality I have ever had. Keep away from this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and especially great service. The dishes we ordered like lamb pepper, chicken pepper, spicy boiled fish fillet all were awesome. Right amount of spice and delicious.  The service needs a special mention. The host was really humble, friendly and suggested the house specialities. Even if you were a newbie to szcehuan, this is the restaurant to go, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my go-to restaurant in South Oakland.  Where else can you get a heaping plate of food and a drink for under eight dollars?  Keep in mind that this restaurant has two menus.  I recommend the traditional Chinese one.  If you're that guy who order General Tso's or sesame chicken, then you're wasting your time here because what you just ordered is not in fact food but filth.  Next time order real Chinese food.  The stir fried pork with green pepper is spot on with its authenticity and flavor profile.  The average American will need to get a little adventurous in order to truly enjoy this place.  Take a look around you, are any of the native Chinese ordering orange chicken? No way.  Remember, there are two menus; do yourself a favor and order from the one that the Chinese use.    Also, Jason is really a lifesaver.  In case you're wondering what that means, just know that he's always got his customers' backs and never ceases providing excellent food with expedient service."}
{"text":"Not even worth one star. My mother came in twice ordering papaya salad w/crabs and both times there were no crabs. I think they ran out of crabs, but they did it anyways without letting my mom know, thinking they could get away with it. Third time they did it again and did not include the crab, so my mom was furious and she called to tell them that this was the third time, and so they promise her a papaya salad on the house, and make sure that the crabs are included in there as well. Well, she came back they changed their mind and told my mom that they can't do anything about it because she already ate it, and it's out of their hands....she gave that place 3 times to redeem themselves, but they don't seem to care. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Phone in an order to pick up. Decided to try the pineapple fried rice w/shrimp from the Thai menu, broccoli shrimp from the Chinese menu and an order of dumplings/pot stickers.  Asked for medium spice on both entrees.  They indicated that medium Thai was hotter than medium Chinese.  No problem, appreciate them telling me that. My order would be ready in about 20-25 minutes.  Arriving there 25 minutes later, I would say it's your typical take out/delivery place.  They have seating and a few tables, but you'll likely not be eating there with any degree of frequency. My order was ready, the people at the front counter were nice and I was on my way.  I thought the food was good.  The veges were fresh the shrimp were firm and tasty.  The rice was cooked well.  The dumplings were good, not too much dough and they had that nice browned side to them.  They weren't piping hot like the entrees, but not cold either. The Thai medium is definitely hotter than the Chinese medium.  The Chinese heat level was OK, the Thai heat level was better.  I like hot foods, but also still like to taste the food at the same time.  I enjoyed the dishes I and there is plenty left over for another meal as well. Will I order from them again? Yes."}
{"text":"I ordered Kung Pao Chicken to go. I got home and opened it up and all I saw was onions! And theses weren't even scallions, they were sliced strips of yellow onions and the box was half full of them. I had to wade through the entire package to find a few tiny bits of chicken and a few peanuts. It tasted okay, but it didn't taste even close to what anyone who has had Kung Pao Chicken would recognize. I dumped literally half the contents of the box down the disposal. I ate what little chicken I could find. It's a Thai restaurant who makes Chinese meals, but they don't do it very well. Won't be back."}
{"text":"One night, i ordered delivery from there and I got the Lard Nar (my favorite Thai dish) and it was very good. It wasn't the best I ever had, but it was better than okay. I am a huge fan of their Tamarind Chicken Wings they are spicy and crispy yet smothered in sauce! I also like the Pad Thai but I have yet to try their Chinese dishes, but I love their Thai food :)   I've ordered from there about a half dozen times and they always remember my address and now even my name (!) and are very quick to deliver. I live by Southern & McClintock and they never take longer than 35minutes to reach my door.   The ONE issue I have is that they NEVER get my heat specifications right!! i like it spicy and I usually order an 8 or 9 depending on how much I want to punish myself that day. My food is NEVER a freakin' 9... Its usually kind of spicy or not spicy at all. I'll even say, its okay - I love spicy foods and nope - let down.   I still love the flavor and then I'll throw in some red chili flakes and it'll be all good. :) So if ur a diehard Thai food infianado this isn't the place for you, but if you like \"basic\" and yet satisfying place this is for you. I can't tell you about the interior or service because I've never been there. lol I'm a delivery customer But I am a fan and I order from here often and I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food, decent price.  Got the chicken lo mein.  Wish they cleaned the place a bit more though"}
{"text":"This is a really great place.  The girl at the counter is always very friendly, and the food is authentic and freshly prepared, and definitely a great value for the price.  The drunken noodles are very yummy.  I also highly recommend the Tom Yum soup with shrimp, though it takes a while to cook.  It's well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I recall walking in and standing right in front of two employees who just continued their convo while I patiently waited to be served. Finally after at least 5 minutes I was addressed and I placed my order. I couldn't tell if the server was unfriendly, if it was merely a cultural thing, or if he just had trouble understanding me. Anyway since I'm giving the benefit of the doubt here, I increased my ranking by one star.  I ordered the beef noodle soup and it was terrible - too spicy and the beef had a weird taste to it. Usually after I leave establishments one of the employees will either say thank you, have a good day or something, but not in this place.  A few things to take into account are that the employees were college age and it was pretty close to closing time so that could have impacted the level of service. All in all I just did not enjoy my experience and I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This store is totally disgusting. Display says 2items with noodle or rice is $9.99+TAX. and then I select 2 items and they charged me $13+TAX.  I thought I can choose from everything, and just picked up 2 but maybe they have some of exceptions(extra cost).  That's horrible, never happens in Thai restaurants that I can pick up 2 or 3 items like same style. Staffs are rude, they say something in Chinese I don't understand.   2 items meal doesn't worse $15, I don't  use here anymore."}
{"text":"the worst food I ever ate in my life!!!! the smoked duck was the worst smell ever!!!!! like a dead body!!!!! please close forever!!!"}
{"text":"If I was able to take away the one star that I gave this restaurant, I would. The food was pure trash. I had to pay a $12 minimum plus a delivery fee and when the driver arrives, she expected me to leave my warm home and run out to her car in the rain.  The whole purpose of delivery is to 'deliver' the food to me.   I ordered their General Tso's chicken but there was a memo that I didn't get. They decided to substitute my chicken for tofu, which I personally think is the most disgusting thing known to man. It was so bad I threw the shit away and ordered a pizza. Definitely a waste of the 90 long minutes I waited for delivery from a place that's a mile away.   The best part of my meal was the shrimp rolls.  Not that they were exquisite or anything but they were edible and had actual shrimp. The fries were soggy.    If you want Chinese food, stay away from this place. Don't be lured by their cheap prices. It's cheap for a reason.  You have been warned!"}
{"text":"Food was tasteless. Had the schezuan duck and a veg lo mein. Both were bland. Tables and cutlery weren't clean."}
{"text":"Best option in Square One Food court by far, Made to order option is excellent, General Tao is made perfectly here"}
{"text":"We were greeted by the very friendly owners. The boiled beef in spicy sauce was fantastic. The green beans were very good, not greasy and ma po tofu was excellent. We had the lamb with cumin plate which was very good. The only thing that wasn't very good to me was the Dan Dan noodles, as mentioned by others, too little sauce and toppings. Would come back as authentic Szechuan is hard to find and I would like to sample more dishes. It was a satisfying meal and only $86 fed four hungry men."}
{"text":"I don't like giving any place a bad review but the General Tso's chicken this place gave me was by far the worst, laziest, most insulting, disgusting 'food' I have ever been served.    The  meat was inedible and no longer even resembled chicken on the inside.  It was kind of like Chinese you leave in your fridge and then a week or so later microwave hoping its still good and then instantly realize its not and throw away.  My best guess is that they made it as part of a large batch, hopefully that morning but at worst earlier in the week, and then repeatedly heated it up and let it cool resulting in the sauce covered husks of string and rubber that they gave me.  The chicken fried rice was almost food but had a slimy texture to it which kept distracting from the flavor leaving an ominous dis-settlement in my stomach as I tried to ignore it, and then ultimately giving up.    I also ordered french fries just to get to the minimum for ordering and thank god I did because they were the only part of the meal that was edible with the added bonus of possibly being digestible.   Speaking of digestible, what little I ate was not.  I ended up awake most of the night sipping water and trying not to vomit, so uh thanks for that.  Overall if this were one bad meal I'd wait a month and try again think I maybe caught them on a bad night before making up my mind. However based on what I got they clearly put no effort into making fresh or even semi decent food.  Yeah this place is cheap but not cheap enough, if it were free I'd still warn against it."}
{"text":"Excellent food, I like the rice and beef, the service is great!!! The ambience is nice and is good for families"}
{"text":"Pretty cheap chinese food that is alright. Not great flavor but you get your food quickly and it's something to eat when you're starving. The food is probably pre-made which is why you get it so quickly."}
{"text":"Small but authentic food. I have tried different popular Thai restaurant but I like this one the best. I have tried Thai food in Thailand before so I know which one is truly authentic food. Trust me, that's real Thai food."}
{"text":"ok first if all I don't review on anything but this time I'm taking some time to review due to my experience today. I called around 7 pm for a delivery, the girl over the phone sounded so annoying like not wanting to answer the phone. she was taking to me if I was stupid. when I got the food I signed the receipt and the delivery guy looked the receipt and said \"oh so no tip?\" with a shitty attitude.  I honestly I usted to like this place. but recently food has lost its good taste and service is shitty."}
{"text":"If you're looking for greasy Chinese delivery, look no further.  Two pad thais and two egg rolls came to less than $20.  The pad thais were huge and left more than enough for next-day lunch leftovers.  The egg rolls were pretty greasy but hit the spot.  Not the greatest food I've ever eaten, but sometimes a girl just needs some really greasy noodles.  Delivery available through Meals Delivered. and Campus Food.  (Campus Food is cheaper.)"}
{"text":"could have left a 5-star if it's not cash only... went to the restaurant next door instead."}
{"text":"The best valued food in the city, probably. For the $5 you pay for, you get a crap ton of food. Greasy? Yes? Salty? Yes. Possibly drowned in msg. But damn good for a cheap meal. I probably only finish half of it each time.   Order in Chinese, and pay $5 for the meal last time I went."}
{"text":"Absolutely digusting. Found a giant fly in the soup half way through my meal. Complaining to their staff only made the matter worse as the lady seemed to find it funny somehow, and would not give a refund. Terribly rude, never going back."}
{"text":"Now that i finished my meal, food is ok,  I ordered the orange chicken, and it was a definitely over done.  I agree with a previous reviewer, definitely set up as a take out place, though I don't plan on taking anything out in the future. Staff is very friendly though."}
{"text":"I'm not good with spicy food so I hesitated to try Szechuan Express for a long time, but when I finally did come I realized there were many non-spicy options to choose from. After spending a little bit of time beating myself up over this major mistake, I ordered a combo of fried noodle with lemon chicken and honey garlic chicken while my friend had some spicy fried fish and black pepper beef with shanghai noodles.  First off, I was impressed that they had many \"base\" options; shanghai noodles, fried noodles, rice noodles, and rice. All of the noodle/rice options were pretty good on their own too, not just flavourless lunch box filler material.  My family likes Chinese food perhaps too much, so when I go out myself I'll usually eat anything but. However, this I could see myself eating time to time. Nothing was overly salty or oily, the meat was lean, all the food was super fresh and flavourful, and after getting home, I didn't feel really thirsty like I sometimes do after eating out.  Anyways, I liked the lemon chicken a lot but imo the honey garlic chicken was more unique tasting and overall just better. Lemon chicken felt like normal fried chicken but the honey garlic was sweet, less dry, and it was absolutely delicious. I would definitely eat both again. I tried some of my friend's stuff as well; the spicy fish was great, but the black pepper beef, while good, had a bit too much black pepper in it. My friend said that he liked it that way, so maybe it's just me.  Portion size is pretty good. There's enough to stuff you silly for lunch or dinner. Pricing is alright as well, $8-ish for a decent amount of food. Even the cheapest Chinese take out places charge at least $6.50 for a lunch box, so for a store in the Square One food court, Szechuan Express is definitely one of the better places to get the best bang for your buck.  Most important take-away from my entire review - try the honey garlic chicken."}
{"text":"I got the Asian pan fried noodles with shrimp, a vegetable egg roll, and the vegetable fried rice. The noodles were disgusting. They were so hard and inedible. I could not chew the noodles and ended up throwing that away. The vegetable egg roll was good, but not worth going back for. The vegetable fried rice was edible, but did not seem sanitary. There was a lot of eggshell in the rice and some questionable things. I would not recommend this to anyone! I ended up throwing away the noodles and the rice, and my money."}
{"text":"it was all fun and games until the orange chicken gave me food poisoning."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this place many times for delivery and without fail they always impress. The orders are correct, the food arrives hot and quickly, and it tastes good! Reasonable prices and friendly service. I have nothing to complain about and will order from here in the future."}
{"text":"This place was very good. I got the crispy spicy teriyaki chicken. I liked that it was a piece of chicken that was fried and then sliced. Some Chinese food places do to much breading. It was kind of a panko like crust too. Very good. I am pretty sure they make their own noodles there. I really liked them. It's a great lunch spot with their special. Be expected to pay $2 more to upgrade to the noodles. A little pricey, but I think worth it."}
{"text":"I went back today and had basically the same dish.  The food was good and satisfying.  The iced tea is a little strange, probably a Thai tea but the food is good and the people are nice."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Love their lunch specials, out the door for less than 5 bucks with a rice bowl.  Authentic Thai food and spiciness that goes with it. Eat here at least once a week"}
{"text":"The food isn't bad, though not a particularly good value.  My big issue is that, as others have noted, they rip you off.  The menu says one price, but then they charge you a different price, claiming some undocumented exception that isn't listed on their menu, and they don't speak any flippin' English, so good luck arguing with them.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Fast service, great price. Don't order the wonton soup, it has no flavor at all. Cold Sesame noodles are good, very peanuty almost sweet. Tai Chi chicken is delicious. Fried rice leave much to be desired.   Dont seek it out, but good in a pinch.   Im bummed because the wonton soup is really what i wanted and it was the worst of the items i ordered."}
{"text":"I feel a bit sorry that this place has a lot of bad reviews, because in my opinion the service was ok (nothing spectacular, it's the urban eatery) and my noodle soup with egg noodles was fine and well cooked, not the most amazing soup I had but it was a nice portion and a nice dinner for eight dollars."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Clean restaurant. Food was delicious! We got a shrimp dish and the fish in chili. The dishes are large for sharing with others. There were only two of us, so we had leftovers to take home. They even gave us extra rice when they packed our food for us. We did not feel rushed at all. They even offered us more tea when we got our bill."}
{"text":"Honestly one of my favorite Asian food joints in Oakland. It's cheap and the portions are huge, so as a college student, it fills all of my expectations. I've gotten their veggie egg rolls a few times and wasn't a huge fan because it was basically filled only with cabbage so I wouldn't get it again. Their tofu dishes are always great- my favorite is General Tso's. Last time I went, they gave me the wrong tofu dish, but that was great, so I'm not too upset about it.   They're fast, cheap, and conveniently located; I'll definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Literally a shish hole. Yes it's cheaper than all the other asian food places in Oakland, but what I paid for was barely edible. How about you give me $5 and I'll give you a plate of lard.   Will not come here again! Spend the extra 50 cents and cross the street to Taiwan or Sushi Boat for more decent food."}
{"text":"I really like this place, it has huge servings for fairly decent prices, noodles or rice with 2 choices of dishes is $11 with tax and they fill up the container completely too. I mean i'm sure that there are better chinese food restaurants around, but for a food court, this is above average quality and flavour. Tasty food and fast service.   Just make sure you have an idea of what you want before you line up as it's a fast moving line and the counter staff is very fast, so there is a bit of pressure to have your order in your head before you line up or everyone in line and behind the counter will give you the stink eye :)"}
{"text":"Hands down, this is the BEST pan-asian cuisine in the city.   There are some great places to get chinese food, or pad thai in this wonderful city, but the combination of raw-quality and cheap cheap cheap prices rockets this place to the top of the list.   This place is amazing. It's always a good sign that the food is good when you watch the other patrons order and many of them are students at the Universities in the Oakland who hail from Asia, and order in their native tongue.   This place is NOT fancy... and there are poorly shot 8x10 photos of all the food lining the walls, so if you don't know the name of the dish you want to try you can always see it. I prefer this to some kind of kitschy wallpaper with pandas.   Also, I've never waited for than 8 minutes for anything here, and a single dish has never cost me more than $6... and that money will get you a take out container PILED with food. Get takeout, and eat it for at least 3 meals.   I once commented on how good the Pad Thai was here, and the guy behind the counter told me in good english, through a bit of an accent, that their old chef was originally a chef in Thailand, and he had brought his own recipe from home, and allowed them to keep making it that way. It is the best i've had in the city... not the prettiest, mind you, but the BEST tasting.   I HIGHLY recommend this place. Besides all this, where can you eat and feel like you are in the movie Blade Runner?"}
{"text":"On my way home from work, I always walk by this place and I always see people walking into here.  So I decided to give it a shot and see what's up.  I'm not a health freak or a food guru nor am I picky about food but this place is just plain bad.  The $5/meal is pretty decent until they charge you an extra $2 for lo mein instead of rice.  But the biggest thing that bothers me is the huge puddle of oil that the food sits in.  Again, I'm not a health freak but eatting this food just made me feel guilty.  With every bite, I think about getting a heart attack at 27.  There's as much oil as there sauce and you see the thick oil floating above. don't expect a fantastic dining area either.  it's dark and feels icky.    I've had my fair share of cheap chinese food, and this is probably the worst I've tried."}
{"text":"So I went by the reviews and (I thought) past experience eating here...and told my coworkers they would like this place. Ordered on Grub Hub.  it took over 1 hour and 15 minutes to get the food...(it is about a mile and a half away, maybe)...crab rangoons were soggy and cold, and the filling is mostly cream cheese...Pad Thai was greasy and lukewarm, no peanuts (isn't that a staple of Pad Thai recipes???)  I normally don't call and complain, but we tipped well and I was starving.  They told me they don't put peanuts in ANYTHING b/c of allergies (but the menu clearly lists peanuts) and they offered to replace the rangoons.  Well I was hungry so I asked for Chicken and Eggplant to replace the Pad Thai...so about 30 more minutes later...we get only slightly less cold and greasy Crab Rangoons, and a gross interpretation of the eggplant dish, slathered in some dark brown greasy flavourless sauce.  No other veggies, just chicken..  Two bites and I gave up.  I'll be eating cereal tonite.  Oh, and I asked my BF,  \"is this the place you really like and we both enjoyed in the past?\"  Oops, no that was ORIENT EXPRESS on Forbes, near the museum/South Craig.  That IS good Chinese.  Yes, it was inexpensive...but when you can't eat it...cheap just doesn't cut it.  I think there's a reason the meals were 6.66.  I'm waiting for the stomach pains..."}
{"text":"Amazing place with great food and very friendly people. Truly a great place to try some real Chinese food."}
{"text":"Their delicious pineapple fried rice with steamed tofu is my favorite at this take out place, in fact that's all I get here, tho I'm told their Thai noodle dishes are also good  Always friendly.    Why is it named Szechuan Express since it's a Thai place?  I don't know.  TIP:  TELL THEM NO MSG!!!"}
{"text":"First, let me say I am VERY picky about my Chinese food (and by Chinese, I mean, the Americanized version of Chinese food).   The great thing about Szechuan Express, is that they are related to the delicious but horribly busy Szechuan Szechuan in First Canadian Place. I love that they have lots of tasty options, like General Tso chicken or Tofu, about 5 kinds of chicken, crispy beef, many kinds of noodles and rice, as well as chicken balls and egg rolls. The best part however, is that the meat is MEAT, and not battered, gamey cartilage or unidentifiable chewy stuff.  Its white breast meat.  And it is GOOD! I've really enjoyed the Singapore noodles here, as well as the lemon chicken, crispy ginger beef, and sweet and sour chicken.  All were very good.     A meat and side of rice will run you about $7 with tax."}
{"text":"My favorite chinese place of all time... GOd i miss this place, my favorite place to go when i was in college.  Good price, good portion, perfectly flavored( not too sweet, greasy) Would love to stop by someday soon!!"}
{"text":"Be careful with your check! When you see item \"party dishes\" you should know that they've charged you tips without your permission! (Plus the tax of the tips)The owner is Chinese and not honest enough to do the business! I felt so bad when I left the restaurant. Never ever come back and will report to government department about this issue."}
{"text":"My Cantonese chow mien was terrible.  AVOID it at all costs!! When I got it, there was no seasoning at all.  The noodles barely touched the wok.  The \"sauce\" was liquid from the veggies, there was no cornstarch to make it shiny and slippery, there was no soya sauce, no pepper, no oyster sauce to make a cantonese chow mien sauce.  I sent it back and told them to keep their money but to tell their cook it's terrible and do something about it.  I won't be coming back here.  It's fast food, but seriously, make it edible."}
{"text":"First time here - the food was really good. They were able to customize it according it to our needs. Having eaten at good Szechuan places before, there are always comparisons - and it didn't fail the test. Try the Sliced Fish in Flaming Chilli oil - a personal favorite and the Eggplant and Tofu Hotpot"}
{"text":"Great place for college students. Cheap, fast, and decent food.  It is definitely for the college students who are trying to escape the dining hall food.    The food is cheap but very greasy and not spectacular.  I did enjoy my meal but would advise against the fried rice because it is too greasy.  Get steamed if you are in the mood for rice. Also, they charge for fortune cookies which bugged me but the large helpings made up for it."}
{"text":"The girl who attended me was extremely rude and unkind. She gilled my plate with so much noodles and half a table spoon of meat. Seriously bad quantity of protein and bad looks at this place!!! Stay away."}
{"text":"Oh my god. Yes, pretty much anybody can cook better than this, and anybody can pick better quality ingredients than this.   Their cooking is extremely oily, and they use the cheapest, grittiest, grainiest beef; the smallest, hives-inducing shrimp; the weirdest burnt garlic-Szechuan-wannabe seasoning in the vegetables; the weakest, most corn-starched clay pot I've ever seen.  Ended up here because my visiting dad saw a misleading ad in the local Chinese newspaper and insisted that we eat here.   To add to your pain, you *will* get hit with a surprise, $1 per small bowl of white rice charge. There were three of these rice charges on our check. This is unscrupulous and out of place in the local Asian restaurant market.  What a joke. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Tons of options, not very good food, but cheap.  The second star is because they are quick and cheap.  Sometimes, that's what you need."}
{"text":"My g/f and I LOVE THIS PLACE. For starters, they are always friendly, smiling and helpful, which is an absolute anomaly these days. At Southern and Dobson, it's semi-close to where we live (and they deliver). Their Massaman Curry must be tried by anyone wanting the best of this stripped-down joint (they now have tables for dine-in). It's Chinese/Thai oriented, for those who want something maybe in both of those worlds, and want it fast, delicious and (relatively) cheap.   We always get the side order of crab puffs (you get like 10 of them! or maybe we do, for ordering them so religiously!), which are just a little slice of heaven on earth in comfort food. The shrimp in lobster sauce is also a scrumptuous choice. Grab a Thai iced tea as well, to round out an outstanding dining experience. Good for run-in and carry out, dine-in, or delivery, Szechuan Express is west Mesa's little gem of Asian cuisine tastiness! Thank you SE staff for your excellence!"}
{"text":"Kinda put off a little by the snell and its cobstant use of styrofoam and plastic for everything and both dine in and out. And everytime i try something new here instead of the usuals, i immediately realized why i always go for the usual."}
{"text":"Don't know why this place has soo many bad reviews, I love this food court Chinese food! They make the crispy shredded beef the way I like it ( although sometimes it can be a miss). They also have my beef with black bean sauce which is another die hard favourite for me. I think the reason why so many people aren't satisfied with their food is because they get their meat on fried rice or noodles. The key is to get your meat on STEAMED rice, that way you can enjoy the flavours of the meat without the salt from the fried rice or noodles competing with it. They also have dim sum which actually looks good, I have yet to try it though."}
{"text":"What makes this place so amazing?  The $8 meal that will last two or more days?  The insanely fast service?  The fact that there are undoubtedly better Chinese restaurants but *something* makes you keep coming back?  Perhaps the world will never know!  But what I do know is that whenever I get a craving for Szechuan Express, it will not subside until I'm sated with a vegetable roll and - my current favorite - General Tso's tofu.  I've been grabbing food here for around 10 years and have never had a problem.  I'm very picky when it comes to chicken - if there are any \"bits\", I won't be coming back.  But I've always had perfect meat here.  I only recently tried the tofu and while it's not the best, it's still decent.  It's not too chewy and soaks up the sauce but doesn't turn into a sponge.  The General Tso's sauce itself is tangy and, yes, quite greasy.  But sometimes that's just what hits the spot!  You get a choice of steamed or fried rice; I always go with steamed.  I *think* you can ask for brown, but I always get the default white.  If you're looking for quick, cheap, filling Chinese without any frills, get ye to Szechuan Express!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of a smeggy Chinese takeout and this place fits the bill. You get a big portion of hot food, real quick. There are numerous dishes that I have had that have been pretty meh but after a few attempts I found some dishes that are exactly the kind of Chinese artery clogging that I want some times."}
{"text":"I came here and the food was so disgusting. I would recommend a different Chinese restaurant to go to. The egg rolls were so greasy they left the whole bag they came in soaked. A waste of money and time."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have ordered from here twice and she has gotten sick both times. I have been OK, but the quality of the food is definitely in the \"cheap\" category so those with sensitive stomachs need not apply."}
{"text":"I have to admit, for a food court, they are pretty decent.  I find their soup noodles/ramen a bit salty, but of course, I find all ramen salty.    However, I think this is probably the best Asian fast food joint in the Square One food court because:  a) You have the option of doing combos or made fresh to order; b) The fresh to order is pretty good and tastes semi-authentic.  I've had their Mongolian beef and their curry fried rice.  Both had good flavours. c) Apparently, their sesame balls are pretty good here too.    Verdict: If you want decent Asian food and willing to pay the \"food court\" convenience fee, it's not a bad choice. Fair warning - quite a bit of msg though."}
{"text":"I don't really want to write a review because I want to keep this place to myself. Hands down best Szechuan restaurant in Vegas. I've only been once, tonight, and we ordered Szechuan style dishes. They were the best I've had in town.   Sliced boiled fish in hot chili oil was fantastic. Perfect spice, nice flavor with a lot of tender fish. Cold Szechuan noodles were nice too. Best I've had in a long time. My wife ordered a chicken dish but I don't speak Chinese so not sure what it was. It was good.   Great hidden gem. A must try"}
{"text":"All the times I have been here, always ordered a la carte. That's the only reason I like made to orders as I request no/little oil, no meats or fish sauces and sometimes a bit more spice.   Ordered a veggie noodle soup with whole wheat noodles, a fried rice and Schewan Noodles.   The soup is the best as it does not have any fat, no spice, no meats and healthy. I add spice to it and the soup is the best diet food I can get. Tons of veggies and good quantity of noodles.   The rice and noodles were amazing as we request no oil a bit of garlic and a bit of spice. Very healthy and quantity fairly good.   Love that they take special request. Some cooks probably don't talk fluent English, but they do what we request them. The food is vegan and love them for that."}
{"text":"Not great. Dan dan noodle lacked sauce and noodle was not authentic (I'm Chinese) they also have lunch cold dishes specials (3 in 1 special), the tofu was dried and not good.   This place seems to be catwring for tour groups fyi."}
{"text":"Traveller, please don't go. This is the second time I come here. I brought my friends to eat here. We paid our bills after we finished eating. Then we recognized that there is still one more dish didn't come to the table. Then I asked, the waitress told me she rushed our bill at the beginning. Then I told her I have to see the bill, finally she brought to me. I found out the last dish had been billed to us, but by the time we haven't  see it on our table yet. Her excuse is she mentioned to us before we paid the bill but it takes time to cook. We ordered a fried cucumber with eggs , there is no such thing on the menu , but they charged me fried cucumber with shrimp . My questions is where is the shrimp.  They charge the tips by 18% automatictly on bill and they still asked for the tips. It is unfortunately experience at Vagas .  I wish owner treat all the customers like the same. It is all about the honestly!"}
{"text":"The food is cheap for a reason. Don't waste your time. Crab rangoons were salty, general tsos tasted like dirty mop water, curry noodles were dry with seasoning sprinkled on top, the only edible thing I ordered was chicken with mixed veggies and that still was pretty gross. I can get down with some crappy Chinese food but this was pushing it too far....didn't even get a fortune cookie :("}
{"text":"I am from NYC but I have to say this place is one of the best Sichuan food in Vegas. If you love spicy Chinese food you should not pass this one. The owner is very friendly. FYI, you really love spicy, you may want to ask the owner make it spicier, otherwise I think it is a bit too sweet. Their lunch and midnight snack have best deal you may have same selections for better price. I had been dinning there for 3 days when I stayed in vegas. By the way, they DO have mid night snack till 2 am."}
{"text":"Love finding these great places that serve authentic Szechuan food!  We had two items...the sliced fish in spicy chili sauce and a sautéed A Choy veg side dish. The A Choy was fantastic, well seasoned and delicious. Even my carnivore husband happily devoured it. The fish was great too, though not as good as the best version we've tasted. We give it an 8 out 0f 10 in taste, which is quite good and we enjoyed it.  We would definitely eat here again.  The service was 10+. Very friendly, prompt, attentive. Great experience and we would recommend you give this place a try if you're it into Americanized Chinese food. There were only two other tables, and both were Asian families. Both families had a big electric hot pot in the center of the table, and the servers kept bringing them fresh ingredients to add to the pots."}
{"text":"Run away - go anywhere else in the food court - DON'T EAT HERE -  If I could write the review with no stars it would still be too much acknowledgement.   Ordered a dumpling and a shrimp & pork Har Gow - both undercooked and terrible - actually horrible  and  it's a food court so I felt it was okay that I spit everything into my napkin also had eggplant & noodles. It all tasted as if it was cooked in chemicals - HORRIBLE !!!   I knew I should have ordered soup at the THAI place - thank goodness your in a food court with lots of options  Will not be going back to Szechuan Express ever - HORRIBLE did I say that already ?? oh well it was worth saying it again so you will listen."}
{"text":"We order from here quite frequently and love their Crispy Thai chicken. I love that their food is not terribly sugary like so many Chinese restaurants that end up catering to local palates by frying pieces of chicken and dunking it in essentially caramel. Their fried rice is nice but I prefer just plain white rice. I once got a bit of egg shell in my fried rice but I won't really hold that against them. The people working there are friendly and welcoming. The restaurant itself is kind of a hole in the wall, but their food is fantastic."}
{"text":"Have you ever under estimated something and it turned out to be extremely the opposite? I have never heard of this place before and thinking I just need to something to eat after a long hard day of work(they charged so little for delivery,so why not!??!!) Szechuan Express wasn't where I thought I would go for Thai food,I was wrong!!! I ordered  delivery for Pad See Ew and Basil Fried Rice(both Thai hot!) I got exactly what I wanted, Thai hot!!!(thank you!!!)The meat was seasoned right,tendered and so yummy! The foods I ordered was so perfect!! Will definitely order from them again and will take my family to eat there. I gave them a five stars immediately after tasting the foods! That's extremely rare for a Thai native to give a good rating(we are picky with the taste of our foods,ask my husband)THANK YOU SO MUCH"}
{"text":"On Sat 5/9/15 , a day before Mother's day, I took my mom and my wife and friends, total of 4 people to eat there, the food was ok, not that great. after I paid the bill the owner call me over and tell me there is 14% tip I have to pay, I was like WHAT!!!! never had this before, she told me there is a 14% tip for 4 people or more. Correct me if I'm wrong but the tip included the good service. not the serviced like them!! but I had to paid the tips anyway according to them!!! never go back there again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Cheapest of the cheap. Greasy, fast, oily, salty, and under flavored Chinese. I've tried multiple entrees, more so ones away from Americanized dishes, and each time I walk away questioning why I gave this place another chance. They offer so many different kind of dishes that the execution is always a miss. And their meat pieces definitely speak to the quality of their restaurant as a whole. That's not even describing the restaurant itself which is quite dingy. I'm all for a cheap lunch price but other places nearby aren't that much more expensive and come without the grease nausea."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last 21 yrs, when I lived close by.  I always get the #10 house chicken combo spicy (scale 1-10), I get a ten!!  I've yet to find a place that has something similar in Arizona!   This is awesome food!  My kids love the sweet and sour chicken!  Everything is GREAT!    -mark"}
{"text":"Horrible service ! Terrible and rude receptionist! Tried to make a reservation over the phone for the next day.But they insisted we go to restaurant there for confirmation in person which is very unreasonable. My husband tried to know why , but she just hang up on him. Never happened to us before ! We always tried to support Chinese restaurant because we are Chinese , but they just don't deserve it . 0 star ! 0 ! 0 ! 0 !"}
{"text":"I had shrimp chow mien and pork fried rice.  I didn't like either.  The first was dry with an overly fishy taste and the pork fried rice was very bland.  Other reviews raved about their Pad Thai but I didn't try that.  Stay away from the chow mien and fried rice."}
{"text":"I don't really understand the low ratings for this place, as the food is some of the best you can get in a mall setting.  It seems that a lot of the poor reviews relate to service at Szechuan Express, but what exactly do you expect at a mall food court?  It's a mall food court, not the Ritz-Carlton.  The food here is really some of the best you can get in the setting, and it's very good (even if you weren't at the mall food court).  They have a wide variety of dishes and the custom made items are very good as well.  When we're in town we always stop at the Eaton Centre and this is our first choice of places to eat there.  Their garlic noodles and their chicken dumplings and chicken wonton soup are delicious.  I also enjoy their eggplant and their chili chicken.  Overall, this is pretty high end mall food court food.  It's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Too bad what most people have said about this place but I ONLY eat here whenever I'm at the Urban Eatery (Toronto Eaton Centre).  I've tried many others (Big Smokes, Amara, the vegan place, etc.) and I find myself returning to this place.  I've been here about 5+ times now and it's been almost every time. (Don't get the noodles as they seem to forget to taste it before it comes out so rice is a better option as you can't go wrong with that one). It's recommended if you want to grab something at the food court apart from McDonald's. Other than these two restaurants, the rest are garbage (being pretentious in a food court because they renovated)  Food: 4.5/5, Super delicious and the right amount of spice for me. I often get the rice with szechuan beef which I think it's the best. Their crispy chicken, chilli chicken or general tso are good as well.  Service: 2/5, service is not the best, they either have complaining customers or simply are unhappy and this could kill your mood if you are excited about the food. Also, you have to ask for everything like utensils, water etc.  Nothing is offered as a service.  Ambience: N/A, It's the urban eatery (food court).  There is no ambience  Price: 4/5, It comes to around $10 per person.  Cheap food for great portion size and tasty food."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week.  Their chicken with vegetables, wheat noodles and spicy broth soup is my \"go-to\" when I neglect, forget or am just too darn lazy to brown bag it.  For less than $7.50 it's a large portion, very filling and flavourful.    I have to say that I tend to stick to their soup offerings, as having tried their buffet options, I've found them to be overly salty, greasy and not particularly healthy.  The portions for their buffet offerings are good and the prices are okay, but still a little steep for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Had the Lunch Pad Thai and I really enjoyed it asked for them to make it spicy and they didn't hold back. I was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I only get Mongolian pork and beef noodle soup here as most other things that I've tried are lackluster. But I mean, $5 for a quick meal is really not bad. Just don't take your date there."}
{"text":"Unbeatable soup menu. My favorite is the beef soup with rice noodles. Their buffet style food is fresh at peak lunch times. One of the best Asian fast food counters."}
{"text":"Ton of options to choose from! Everything I've ordered has been very good. As soon as you sit down after ordering your food is already made. Very affordable and decent portions. One of my favorite places to stop and get traditional Chinese food after work."}
{"text":"Okay, for what Szechuan Express is, it succeeds. I'm giving it four stars because I like cheap, greasy Chinese food, and this was my favorite place for it as a Pitt undergrad. I go back every time I'm in Oakland, and I get the tofu and broccoli with garlic sauce, and I am content. Yes, it's a ton and a half of rice, but the sauce is delicious, and you get plenty of tofu and broccoli for, you know, a week. Food comes quickly and it's always hot. There's a cooler with cans and bottles of everything, there's plenty of seating, and the same dependable crappy music is always playing. And for all these bad reviews, there are always people there. Like I said, whenever I visit Pgh, I stop at Szechuan Express for a solid block of Chinese food."}
{"text":"Food is fairly ok and cheap. But apparently they get late sometimes. It's been an hour since I ordered food and it's still on its way"}
{"text":"Even for lunch on Sunday, this place started to fill up right when it opened.  This pretty much speaks to all the high points of Szechuan Express--fast, cheap, large portions, and decent enough quality.  There are photos of all the dishes lining the walls--you should know to expect utilitarianism walking in.  Two of us ordered the 65 SAUTEED SHANGHAI BOK CHOY (made spicy upon request), 72 SHRIMP WITH EGGPLANT WITH GARLIC SAUCE, and 127 COMBINATION NOODLE SOUP.  Everything was okay, everything could have used a little salt.  Sautéed bok choy is pretty hard to screw up.  The eggplant was nice and saucy, but sadly the sauce was a little bland.  The noodles were the biggest disappointment--the veggies in it tasted decent enough but the chicken and noodles had zero flavor.  My fiance found it fine enough for lunch but not worthy of keeping the lefties.  Still, for about $22 for all 3 dishes and a huge pile of leftovers that I'll whip into a tastier stir-fry by seasoning the crap out of it, I can't say I'm too disappointed.  They named it Szechuan Express for a reason--even they know what's up."}
{"text":"Go  there periodicly. Like everybody else says good portions and tasty. College aged kids know where to find large portioned foods in oakland. Dah!   Love it, having statue of Jesus and pic in dining room blessing your food.   Same Cashier is always there. Think he lives behind that counter."}
{"text":"Awesome Chinese food and great service! It's definitely one of the best Chinese restaurants in vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing food! My Chinese coworker went here after work because she said it was one of her favorite Chinese restaurants in town. This restaurant quickly went up to my go to Chinese restaurant to go to"}
{"text":"I gotta say I was really surprised by the quality of the food here. It's fresh, it's delicious, it's amazing! Okay, amazing was taking it a little too far because not everything on the menu was as awesome as I thought, but most of everything I ordered were awesome - and did I say fresh already? Lol. Price-wise, I'd say average. This is not fast-food Chinese like Rice and Noodles (I also love that place to death because they always make my \"special requests\" perfectly), so you can't compare the price to that. However, compared to the prices of say, KJ Kitchen, the more authentic and popular Chinese restaurant in Vegas, then the prices is about the same. You guys know what I'm talking about if you really do dig Chinese food.   Both my experience there was really good. The waitresses mostly spoke English (quite well too), and were extremely helpful and nice. I'd go there again just for beers and their cold dishes. Cold dishes are popular as an appetizer to Chinese people, but I've rarely ever tasted fresh ones since I was little. So I kind of grew up disliking it. I'm always afraid of tasting that stale, expired taste in cold dishes. But not at this restaurant! Their cold dishes are fresh!!  So far, I have nothing but good things to say about this restaurant. I love this place so far."}
{"text":"Why the hell does lunch at a fast food court cost $16?  I had some lemon chicken, Singapore noodles and an iced tea.  Apparently it is an outlet of the Szechuan Szechuan restaurant, but I couldnt tell. It tasted like any other fast food chinese place, but with an expensive price tag.  If it was 10$ I would give it 3 stars, but 16$, omg, it taught me a lesson in watching what you order at a food court in the financial district."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm having a bad Dan dan day today!!   After leaving a restaurant because of their service and bad Dan dan noodles. I decided to give Dan dan another shot. (How stupid, but I was craving Dan dan.) I yelped and came here.  I came here at 1:30 pm on Sunday. It was empty. Just employees chatting. I thought the store was closed but the guy said he's open so I ordered Dan dan noodles. (This guy was on the phone the whole time I was there. Another couple walked in but they left because of that. No service here.)  Their Dan dan sauce was nice and spicy. (at least it was not sweet!!) After eating 1/3 of it. It became just plain noodles. No taste. I don't know why they skimp on the sauce. Bummer.  After two bad Dan dan experiences of today's, I will not crave Dan dan for a looong time!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Beef with onions in town. (similar to mongolian beef, but there is no sweetness)  He uses quality beef that is not shaved or over marinated. He will mix it up however you want, I usually add bell peppers. Rice is spot on too.  Got it the first visit, now get it about 2 times a month.  Girlfriend got the shrimp kung pao, and it was outstanding too. Nice owner as well."}
{"text":"A restaurant with an identity crisis. On the one hand, the fact that they have around 150 dishes on their menu, mostly around the $5-7 range, caters clearly to the college students in the area and those seeking fast and cheap Americanized Chinese food. Conversely, if you order the right items, then you can get a pretty good value meal, but don't expect any high-quality mainland dishes.  My tip: Look around at what some of the Chinese customers are having, and you'll probably have better luck with them. Their noodle soups, in particular the beef are usually quite large and very satisfying. On the other hand, I dared to try some of their new, more ethnic, dishes when they expanded their menu a few months ago, such as the Spicy Chicken, but they leave much to be desired.  It is well known that they may offer certain discounts if you order in Chinese, but even if you can't the food is cheap enough as it is. The eating environment is not very attractive, and it can get crowded and loud while the tables and trays aren't exactly clean. Mainly an eat and go type of place."}
{"text":"Well I have been here once! The outside and also the interior doesn't really look inviting but I thought maybe they have some reasonable Chinese food. There's not much variety around the university and I have eaten out so much lately that I just wanted to try something else. On the good side they have photos/posters of all their food hanging on their walls which makes it so much easier to decide what you want. You then head to the counter and order! The cashier then gives a shout out to the kitchen via the microphone hanging from the roof!;) the food was prepared so quickly I couldn't even properly sit down and get a glass of water!! This is unfortunately where the good things end. The food was awful. Drowned in oil and sauce. The meat was quite chewy and tough ( I had beef with vegetables). The rice was bland and when I tried to put some chili sauce on it, I realized that they even watered down the chili sauce! Or was there oil in it? I don't know! All I remember is the liquidy texture going everywhere. I probably finished a quarter of my food cause I was so hungry, but all the oil made me feel sick! You probably get what you pay for! For a $5 meal it was a huge portion. But if you're looking for a quality Chinese dish you should probably look elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I like to believe, believe firmly, that all Chinese people eat this way. They deep fry chicken and pork, preferably into useful little balls, and then cover it with rich delicious candy syrups. It's the Szechuan way. It's my way of eating Chinese food. I love it.  You'll find this in the First Canadian Place food court. They keep the line moving fast and efficiently soup nazi style. You get it in a little plastic take out box. You grab a seat. You eat. You look at women in business suits. And then you go."}
{"text":"Ok, firstly, can you get better Chinese food?  You bet your boots !  However, if you need something quick and don't feel like queuing up for 15 minutes, then welcome to Szechuan Express !    This is food court food at it's best.    This place had a huge selection of all the basic Chinese dishes.  I've tried a number of the different items in my combo pack, and for the most part it's all solid food court food.  Does that mean it's great food... Not by a long shot.  However, It's quick, hot and it actually tastes pretty good.  Throw on top of that you get a pile of food for your $$.  Don't get me wrong, quantity is not quality, but there is usually enough in a 2 item combo for my lunch and dinner and for $10 !  I've been to this place in the heat of the noon rush, and they get you through in less than 5 mins, even if there is a large queue.    Overall, I like this place, it's quick and it's good (for food court). I've repeat visited, and likely still will."}
{"text":"Let's just say that the mapo tofu was perplexing..... no sauce, just chunks of tofu, green peas, and cubed carrots."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Szechuan Szechuan before but they're renovating, so, as the sign said i went to check out what Szechuan Express had to offer..   I was looking for some Green Curry Chicken -- It didn't look like they had it.. so I asked \"Do you have any Green Curry Chicken?\" and I was looked at like I wasn't speaking English.. although, and don't take this the wrong way, it didn't seem like any of the 6 grumpy-looking Asians behind the counter had English as their first language.. So then I said ok and looked at the other food available, which looked like it might be ok, but in the meantime while deciding I asked when the restaurant would be reopened? And they grumped out a \"dunno!\" and I decided then and there that I would not be patronizing their establishment today..  So I said \"ok, thanks for your help\" and walked over to the Indian place beside -- where I was greeted kindly and placed my order.. Review pending after I finish eating lunch ;)"}
{"text":"This company deserves every star of this rating. Everything always comes to the door piping hot, super fresh, and very quickly. We get the same delivery guy every time and he is the cutest thing ever and always so incredibly kind. My husband and I are extremely picky about our Chinese food, and these guys surpass expectations!"}
{"text":"Picked up lunch here using mealpal - the special was crispy ginger beef, non Choi and steamed rice. Pick up was quick as food was ready when I arrived. Food was typical foodcourt Chinese.   Solid 3 for me. Will be back"}
{"text":"was craving chinese food and needed a place that delivered. the girl who took my order seemed a bit clueless over the phone so i was a bit skeptical about the food to begin with. the food was pretty standard and exactly what i wanted. i ordered the crispy thai chicken combo...pretty tasty. i like that it comes with a beef kabob skewer. i was also in a soupy mood so i got the wonton soup too. the broth was good, the wontons not so much. would i order from here again? maybe..."}
{"text":"Went again. Even better than the first time!  Had the smoked duck this time which was spectacular. Szechuan noodles (Dan Dan) again which is a must. Spicy beef soup...heavenly.  It's hard to believe this restaurant isn't packed all the time."}
{"text":"It never fails to disappoint me. Staff are unapologetic about the wrong order, food is very small portion when I buy it to go. I gave enough chances to this I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Best location and everything is amazing like chicken and beef and they have 5 kind of noodles and they a so nice and have the best chicken corn soup and spring rolls!! Recommend this place 10/10"}
{"text":"Food was very yummy. Really hearty meal. Took the black pepper beef, pad thai noodle, lemon fried chicken. Great combination and good portion for the price. Not much of a smiley customer service if you smile at them other than that food was really great"}
{"text":"I'm totally bias but hear me out. The price is cheap, the serving size is huge, and the food is done for you faster than McDonalds. Hygiene admittedly aint the greatest... but, just close your eyes and do not look into the kitchen."}
{"text":"I've been here time and time again and this place never dissapoints. When i come here to order i never skip the crispy honey garlic chicken. I'll either have that with just plain rice or if im really starving i'll have it with beef ho fun, and beef in black bean sauce.   Tip: take it to go, they fill the container up its great to save for dinner.  Their fried rice is okay, nothing special. Sometimes pieces of the steamed rice would be hard which is a big no-no in a chinese fast food. I havent tried their ramen but people have been recommending it.   One of my top choices at the square one food court"}
{"text":"Every dish I have had here is good. My favorites are pad Thai with chicken and shrimp. And the panang curry with chicken. The spice is just right, not overpowering."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time here at this new restaurant. We ordered:  ~Napa sautéed with dried shrimp ~Hot & Spicy Pork Intestine & Sliced fish in Clay Pot ~Smoked duck ~Whole red snapper in chef's special hot sauce ~Chinese eggplant in garlic sauce ~Szechuan style bean curd (with minced beef) ~Chunk of chicken in spicy sauce ~Minced pork with translucent noodle  Fair warning: this is NOT an oil-free meal. Most of the dishes we ordered were soaked in chili oil, but that is Szechuan cuisine.  All the dishes were great, but my favorites were the napa, smoked duck, egg plant, and translucent noodle.  The red snapper dish is actual tilapia.   Overall, great place for authentic Szechuan cuisine!"}
{"text":"We decided to call at first and we're placed on a long hold never reaching anyone so we were happy to order through Yelp!!!!  The delivery took about 40 minutes.  A little pricey compared to other restaurants of the same type because the portion was smaller.   Overall the food tasted great and we will order through Yelp again."}
{"text":"Yum GOOD cheap Chinese food... Mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Szechuan Express is a solid place for cheap, quick, Chinese food. It looks exactly like the hole-in-the-wall places that line Clemente Street in San Francisco.  Just walk up to the counter, place your order, then take a seat or wait around to carry out.   The food here is not gonna blow you away with high quality or uniqueness, but for $5 it will surely fill you up. The garlic sauce tastes very similar to the chili sauce, but again, for $5 don't bring in unrealistic expectations. Its a bit grungy inside, so if you need it to be super clean to eat somewhere then maybe you should choose another spot.  A couple good dishes are: beef noodle soup, double cooked pork, and chicken with garlic sauce.   The staff is extremely friendly too. I usually stop in around 2 a couple days a week for lunch and the dude who works there is always laughing and having a good time with the customers."}
{"text":"Fast, cheap...for a reason.  All their dishes are swimming in a combination of grease, sauce, salt, oil, and god knows what else. Of course I wasn't expecting authentic Chinese food, but this wasn't even good Americanized Chinese food. This was one of the few restaurants that messed up Chinese food. My friend I went here with got sick off the stuff, I wouldn't recommend trying this place if your stomach can't handle it.    I got the vegetable delight with garlic sauce and my friend got the shrimp lo mein.  The dishes are hard to mess up but somehow this place accomplished it.  In my vegetable delight there was way too much cabbage stem and not enough of anything else.  My friend's noodles were bathed in soy sauce, she tried to sequester it into one pocket but to no avail for it pooled over to the other compartments.   One good thing about this place is that there is a HUGE selection. The walls are covered with their menu so that's a positive. However, the prices and selection are still not tempting enough to make me go a second time."}
{"text":"If you grew up on the streets of Mumbai like me, eating good food from food carts and hole in the wall joints-then you will certainly appreciate this place. The restaurant is plastered wall to wall with pictures of various menu items and at first can be a bit overwhelming. My go-to favorite has to be the shrimp fried rice with dried chili pepper (extra extra spicy pleeaseeeee). This place is perfect for a cheap fulfilling meal for a hungry bear like myself."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely sick, I was visiting from New York and this was my first meal (don't ask why.. I was starving and this was the first place I approached at the food court) not only was the food flavorless and bland but there was a hair in my food! Absolutely sick!! My sister also order chow mein and she Also hated her meal..."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Snow pea tips, Szechuan beef and cumin lamb, garlic pork. Delicious!! Bring you own drinks is okay they would open it for you."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Never disappointing, solid food for a solid price. You can't expect Michelin start quality, but for the price I don't think you could find anything better!   Only downside, if possible don't use the bathrooms here, unless your new years resolution was weight loss."}
{"text":"You had me at pumpkin curry... Easily the best I've ever had and my wife loved the pad Thai. Will definitely be back and will bring friends."}
{"text":"WOW. I love this place!! My wife won't eat here but I could easily come here everyday. The plain lo mein is the best."}
{"text":"the food is ok.... we have 4people.... When the bill came, they never tell us the tip is add to the bill....instead writing tip...it's party dish $$...everyone one eat here should double check the bill! We almost paid double tip.....that's rude!!!"}
{"text":"Just decided to try this place tonight on a whim. I ordered the drunken noodles and the golden tofu from the Thai menu. Spent $20 after delivery fee and tax for one of the worst Thai food experiences of my life. The noodles are really just mashed left over noodle pieces interspersed with veggies. They're so greasy they drip from the fork and so spicy I can't even eat it. (I ordered mild!) The fried tofu isn't awful, but it's also too greasy for words. I will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"My mom from Taiwan who has been in the hospital for a week had a craving for outside food yesterday so she sent me to Szechuan Express for the Roast Duck Noodle soup.   A bit surprised they used rice noodle, but my mom loved it. For less than $6, two containers (quart and a half?) of soup that really tasted home made with duck and a lot of cabbage.   I had the crispy shrimp plate (107) earlier in the day which came out like a sweet and sour dish which isn't my cup of tea but it was crispy and well made in good quantity with a ton of rice.  Fast, fast service, Taiwanese mom approved..."}
{"text":"I have food allergies and need to sometimes omit certain ingredients from a menu item.  There was no problem with that here and they were willing to even add other ingredients to make up for the ones taken out.  I ordered the chicken coconut soup and Thai fried rice with veggies and couldn't be happier it is so tasty and made special for me.  Bravo Szechuan!"}
{"text":"This was supposed to be the highlight of an otherwise disappointing evening in Mesa, but it too let us down. I ordered the pad thai and my wife ordered another noodle dish, both with tofu. Neither was prepared such that the noodles would pick up much of the sauce and the vegetables were equally overcooked, so we struggled at first to figure out which was which. Both of us literally commented, \"meh\". I would perhaps come back, but only after drinking."}
{"text":"This is my roommate from China's favorite Chinese restaurant in Oakland. He says they prepare the food like his mother did, but he also mentioned that he doesn't think his mother's cooking is that good. There is a rumor that Szechuan favors Asian students which seems to be true according to my roommate who was able to order meals after hours.  Based on my experiences, the food quality and preparation time were on par with the other American style Chinese restaurants on the corner of Oakland Ave and Forbes. Szechuan is a little cheaper but the entree typically consists of a little less meat."}
{"text":"Terrible. Really, that is the only word you need - don't bother reading more because \"terrible\" really sums up the dining experience at Szechuan Express.  We ordered via grubhub's app. I ordered General Tso Shrimp, shrimp fried rice and a small extra white rice. The app offered a coupon so with 2 sodas I met the minimum to add on a free Young Chow fried rice.  Yea! Here comes dinner!  Delivery took a reasonable amount of time. The bag arrived and everything is packaged in Styrofoam. Two things here: 1. Who uses Styrofoam anymore?? it is terrible for the environment and 2. Styrofoam makes everything inside soggy. Yuck. And the sodas arrived warm. I guess they thought we'd like them for later or they are just too lazy to make the cokes cold.  At this point I notice that there are not only zero fortune cookies but zero packets of condiments. My kid was super bummed about the no-cookie bit (me too). Now for the food.  General Tso Shrimp. The shrimp are fried in a heavy batter, like a thick, cheap tempura. Since the batter takes longer to cook it does not take a genius to figure out that the shrimp is so over cooked that if you are lucky it is only just rubbery. Half of them were bone-dry and hard. Yes, they were that over cooked. I included a photo - the shrimp is a the bottom and is so shriveled that it looks just like the gummy tempura batter. Disgusting.  (psst - try this at How Lee - AMAZING)  Shrimp Fried rice. Wow. This was even worse. How they managed to hit both salty and bland is beyond me. The after taste was weird and off. It coated inside your mouth like dirty grease. One bite and the rest in the garbage.  Young Chow Fried Rice. I have had this before from a different place and that place was awesome. This one... and I am not exaggerating... made my daughter cry when I told her that was her dinner. Yes, full tears. I took a closer look and totally got it. I included a photo of it. The pork looks like jerky. I think there was chicken in it, who knows. It looked like vomit. I am not sure I would feed this to a dog it looked so unappetizing. The shrimp looked ok comparatively. No one ate this.  The white rice... yes, the ONE thing EVERY Chinese food place should be able to get right was even dry. Scraped up dry bits from the side and bottom.   It's been just over an hour - and yeah, I ate some, like an idiot. I was starving. Now I feel sick, that bloaty, nauseous feeling with a slight headache bad food feeling...  Terrible. Just terrible.  edit: 9/3/2014 - the business and I had a colorful back and forth about my review over the weekend and the manager indicated that in order to have a satisfying meal that the diner should only eat in or pick up - that the delivery changes the quality of the meal.   While I have my own opinions about this it appears that he likely also complained to YELP about my photos (and likely my review) of the meal I was served by his restaurant. these images, most notably, showed a shrimp so completely over cooked that it had shrunk to about 1/3 of its normal size and was swimming inside of the breading. the other image showed dry, unappetizing fried rice.   What struck me the most about our emails was what I perceived as a complete lack of professionalism and inability to listen to feedback from a customer. Further, if he feels delivery is the issue when why offer it?  To be honest, the delivery was the only thing that met expectation - it arrived within 45 minutes. I have ordered take out from a wide variety of places and have had great meals with it taking even longer to get to me.   so, bottom line for me? the kid who is managing this restaurant pretty much reinforced my opinion of his business. there are a LOT of options out there in this category and i will happily spend my money at any of those before I spend another penny with this place."}
{"text":"Ok, so, I found this place after craving sweet and sour chicken last night.  It was late, and I wanted to carry out.  This place is located within a shopping strip that has quite a few asian quisine's to choose from.  The reason I chose here was because it was exclusively a carry out joint.  I just wanted to grab a bite, take it home, and eat.  So, I enter the place, and its kind of drab, and not really appealing to the eye.  It appears to be a delievery/carry out joint, with NO seating.  So, I review the menu, and place my order for sweet and sour chicken.  The girl behind the counter was warm and friendly, and answered the few questions that I had.  I was kind of iffy about this place. It's not in horrible shape, but it really needs a good cleaning and some updating.  I felt it was kinda dumpy looking.  But, it was late, I was hungry, and I didn't want to be to pessimistic.  Well, I got the food home, and ate it.  It was fine.  But, I ended up getting sick later on that night.  I don't know if its because of the food, or the fact that I am having an ulcer flare up or what.  So, i have to give this place 3 stars, but with hesitation.  I want to say, I am not one who normally has a week stomach.  I don't know if I threw up because of my ulcer, or because of the food, but please eat here with caution."}
{"text":"Szechuan Express was one of my favorite places to get Chinese food in Oakland. However, the closed 30 minutes earlier than their regular posted hours. People plan meals and their days around when businesses are supposed to be open. There was no emergency or reason for the restaurant to close early. Very disappointed when this was what I had planned on having for dinner for me and my friends."}
{"text":"I have been ordering delivery from Szechuan Express for about 7 years now. The food is consistently delicious and the staff are extremely friendly. The prices are good and the delivery menu has coupons available. Delivery is fast and the food is always hot. I've never been in the restaurant itself, so I cannot speak to that aspect. I will continue ordering their food for many years to come. **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**"}
{"text":"Put all the bad service providers in one room ... ask them to serve and cook the most unhealthy meal, welcome to Szechuan Express where Chinese food is given a really bad name. Really bad.   It's cheap so you get cheap service. But no one deserves a rude server. I ordered this honey chicken swimming in sugar and oil. They under charged me and because I did not want to start the new year with guilt, I told them about it. I requested for another cup of water on top of my paid drink and in mandarin, which I understand very little, said the other server: \"this guy is annoying asking for two glasses of water.\"  Really? Average order is $10, I spent over $20.   After I rolled my eyes I went to my table and try to savour my food. Their last savior. My arteries were assaulted by honey chicken, so sweet it can pass as dessert. I ordered pork bun with a hair strand of pork. The rice is equally bad and hard as the hearts of servers.  Stay away. Be healthy and sane."}
{"text":"You know when you have that western Chinese food craving and after you are done  gobbling down that greasy manchuwok you feel gross? Yeah, well Szechuan express taste better and doesn't leave you feeling like that. Granted it is \"fast food\" but fast food with flavour and better quality ingredients. No more wondering \"is that chicken?\"   A family friend of mine recommend I try out the new Asian place in square one good court because the shrimp dish was plump, juicy and actually deveined (per peeve of mine). I decided to try it out. I ordered the general Tao, lemon chicken and chilli shrimp (I believe) for 13 dollars. The portion size was decent I couldn't finish my food. The meat was lightly coated and didn't leave a puddle of oil on my plate and it was actually flavourful and the shrimp was as promised. Plump, juicy and deveined. I stopped eating Chinese fast food for a while but it looks like that's about to change.   Also, around the corner they have a station where you can order your food fresh to order and they make it on the spot. Great idea! Nice addition to the food court. My only recommendation would be a greater variety of drinks. Perhaps more ethnics ones like lychee and mango. I'm not a huge pop fan."}
{"text":"what's working for them is that they are super fast (my food came out in 5 min) and you get to choose from a million different options. you will probably find what you want to eat. I also like that photos of their entire menu is taped onto the walls. it's pretty useful! the photos are actually what the food will look like. I got the spicy peppered chicken for lunch and honestly I don't think that's how la zi ji is supposed to be made, but it was only like $7-8 for a decent portion. won't complain. (also, one of my favorite Chinese songs was playing in the background, so how could I be mean to this place.)   Taste | 2 Atmosphere | 3 Presentation | 3 Service | 3 OVERALL | 2.5"}
{"text":"The name Szechuan EXPRESS should be a hint to everyone who rips this place apart, that they are a business that focuses on quick service Chinese food. Based on the exterior of the building, you should not have super high expectations. A more \"dive\" style restaurant, this place is great for cheap Chinese food, conveniently located in a college environment. More authentic than other places, you can't beat the prices that range from $5 and up. They also offer more than 150 menu options.   While they offer General Tso's chicken, egg rolls, and other Americanized dishes. I haven't tried them. I know people can be very reluctant to try new dishes but step outside of your comfort zone and for such a cheap price, what do you have to lose? For example, ??? (salty pepper chicken), ??? (3 cups basil chicken), ??? /??? (seasoned beef or chicken). These dishes do not come in the styrofoam containers that most dishes will receive. They come in a plastic bowl with a clear top.   If you go at peak hours, it can be very hard to find seating. But take a look around and see that the reason you can't find a seat is because of all the Chinese people eating there. That should indicate to you that the food is decent, even for them. One of my Chinese friends eats here almost every day. As others have said, look around what they are eating, and if it looks good, just ask what the dish is.   Order in Chinese and you'll get a small discount."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai was very bland and greasy. Also, the restaurant itself smelled like a toilet. It smelt so bad, I was relieved to walk outside."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Really good Chinese and service. The spicy shrimp and noodles are great. So is the duck."}
{"text":"It is a bit dodgy looking but good for take out. You can order and within less than 10 minutes they will have your order ready. Cheap prices for large portions, so don't expect high quality. Their food is decent and satisfying for a hungry college student. I usually like their szechuan chicken or hunan chicken with white rice. However, I try to stay away from this place because it can be very oily sometimes."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken and veggie noodle soup with spicy broth, thinking it would be a light and delicious meal. The option of wheat noodles lured me.  I'm an idiot. Come and open the soup bowl in office and oil starts oozing out because of the vaccuum the hot soup created inside. Ruined my nice new skirt forever (I'll try not to let that influence my review).  The taste would have been ok if I could see and taste anything other than oil. Veggies were 2 pieces of broccoli and 1 piece of bok choi. Chicken was, well, fried, soaked in oil (even though I didn't get the crispy option). I removed 7 soup spoons of oil from the top, but still plenty sticking to my palate.  A few bites and I was done till the evening. Take your health and taste buds somewhere else! Never again."}
{"text":"This is a decent place for cheap Asian food with large portions. I usually get the beef noodle stew, but this time I ordered a lo mein. The food here is pretty greasy and salty but it's acceptable. I come here when I can't decide where to eat basically."}
{"text":"This is da best Chinese food I have ever had in Las Vegas! I am actually really surprised that this quality of Chinese food can be existing in Vegas. Furthermore, it is not only a good deal, but also the best deal in vegas! Ps: u gotta believe when a Chinese person is giving a complement to a Chinese restaurant, then their food is really phat~"}
{"text":"I really dig this place because the food is delicious! I got appetizers that they put out in the front to let people see what it is, (I got pig ears, cucumbers, and chicken) which were really fresh. I also got two other dishes containing beef and fish submerged in this spicy broth. I always crave the fish and since this restaurant specializes in szechuan cooking, what the heck. I honestly was not disappointed.   The server was really nice too! She checked back with my family in a timely manner and I really appreciated it."}
{"text":"So so takeout.  Chow mein, Mongo Beef, King Pau Chicken.  It was so-so.  Food was hot and fresh but swimming in onions.  Chow mein was slightly off.  Sometimes those tiny shrimp give things a real fishy aroma. Not to my liking.  I might try a few other things but wouldn't be my go to spot for what I ordered."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed yesterday because my experience with one of their other locations previously was GREAT.  Service here was OK, but one of my meat selections was COLD, another was luke-warm, and the other was dry - too dry to eat around the edge of about 1/3 of the meat.  I asked for their spiciest noodles.  They were pretty tasteless.  I ended up taking part of the food home to give to my dog, and part of it I had to take home because the food needed to be HEATED UP in order to eat it."}
{"text":"Wow.  I'm surprised at the other reviews - and of the other locations.  I had noodles and two meat - and the noodles were OK, the General Tso's chicken was pretty good - and the ginger crispy beef was to die for.  I sat there eating the first few bites and I was literally in heaven.  I started to wonder if I hadn't eaten anything for 2 days - because the food had that 'first food in several days' profound taste and satisfaction to it.  Now maybe their food is too greasy and salty and unhealthy for some people - but I'll be going back there ASAP - and will actually go out of my way to find them again.  If you are carrying the food back to your office - the crispy beef might lose it's crispness - which may really take away from the experience - and I suspect once the food cools down a bit it is only half as good - but I can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"I only order their chicken noodle soup with shanghai noodles. And I love it! Perfect lunch on a cold winter day. Their buffet of food seems to be a bit too greasy so I stick to the soups. Update: found 6 bugs in my soup! Got a refund"}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch really wanting to treat myself knowin this isn't the most healthy food but the stuff looked really tastey. I got the noodles and 3 items. Items were mixed veggies, cashew chicken and spicy beef.  It was as if they put it in lip gloss so much oil and greasey and little taste. The food left me feeling sick  so greasy and not worth it so i threw half of it out.  Never again Szechuan never again."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best outlet in the square one food court. They have a hot table with a wide  variety of meat and vegetarian items . There is also a dimsum section.  A must try is their 'make to order'  menu where they cook a signature dish in front of you in the wok. I have tried them all and their Hakka Chowmein is  very good .  A good way to sample  what they have to offer is to go with some friends and purchase the 3 item combos , each one order different items and try what each one has ordered . This way you get a lovely offering of Szechuan cuisine.  The soups are really good as well with their chicken corn  soup being a hot seller.  There are also their deals  on close such as a two item combo for the price of a 1 item thats available from 8 40 to 9 pm. Try the same sampling strategy with friends on the discounted deals if you are on a budget.  Service is always excellent and quick.  Perhaps them keeping two cashiers at all times will help as the line does get slow  if there is a rush with just  1 cashier"}
{"text":"Let's just say this is not the place for those with weak stomachs. Luckily, I have the digestive system of a champ, so Szechuan was a staple of my diet throughout my college years. Cheap food, tolerable quality, and generous portions are all I need to keep me happy and my stomach/wallet full. They really live up to their \"Express\" name. I've had food come out less than a minute after I put in my order which is probably a good and bad thing at the same time.  I can understand the hate. Is the food five-star quality? Absolutely not. Will you find the occasional stray hair in your food? Quite possibly. But for less than $6 an order, it's a great deal. Even now when I pass through Oakland, I'll stop by for some General Tso's tofu for old time's sake. Of course, they still remember my order after all this time. I'm a Szechuan fan for life."}
{"text":"Every time I'm visiting the Eaton Center, I always stop for some Szechuan Express. I love the cheap price, yet sophisticated taste. I would recommend asking for takeout, in my opinion you get more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Ummm.. no. I don't think I will be coming back for a long time.  They have reasonable lineup, which makes you think the food is decent. And it is also located in the same food court as szechuan szechuan so you would think it would be a cheaper version of their fine dining restaurant. But no, it is totally different, the true representation of chinese fast food here. It is either greasy or salty."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery . Thought it was a bit weird that the chicken was dark meat . (cost extra for white ) I asked for the dish extra spicy and it actually was the perfect for me. It may have just been this dish specifically so I may give it another try, just order something different."}
{"text":"This is my go to delivery Chinese spot. Fair prices and good food. The delivery is always prompt as well. The pot stickers and BBQ pork ribs are hands down my favorite."}
{"text":"Their staff is extremely incompetent and rude to their customers.   On February 2nd 2016, I reached their eaton centre location with some of my friends, just before closing time, and I saw that the dish labels were removed. Since we don't eat beef, we politely asked the lady if there were any chicken dishes still available, a simple question which she failed to understand. After repeating the question several times, she couldn't understand what I was saying.  So we realized out that the lady at the food counter didn't speak fluent english, and we went over the cash counter to seek a simple answer to my simple question. But instead of helping us out, the cashier yelled back at us, telling us that it's not her job to tell us about dishes, and that we should look at the dishes and make out if there are any chicken dishes left. Now how the hell am I supposed to tell the difference between a cooked chicken or beef dish, just by looking at it? Plus, the whole point of having a customer service representative is to help customers!  Naturally, we left the place in search of a better restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place. Been going for a while. Used to love the chicken and garlic sauce but they changed it. They overcook the chicken now. Been sampling the authentic Chinese dishes and man, what a nice change. My favorite is the Taiwanese Crispy Fish. Some of the best food I have ever eaten. Ignore and do not try the Beef Ribs and Shrimp dish. Gosh, it was gross beyond words. But I love this place. And if you look around you see the folk from Asia and what better indication is that that you're getting the good stuff."}
{"text":"Great food great service. I made difficult order and was very unflexible. When driver didnt have enough change because i had 100 dollar bill. Even though i couldnt tio him much he brought rest change iver after stiping by store. Best chinese food service i ever had. Duck i had was really trnder and delicious. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Despite a bad (or two) review on their pad thai, I ordered one to judge it myself and it was pretty good! Take-out is as quick as always (sitting less than 10-5 minutes) with the food nice and hot. The pad thai itself had lots of peanut shavings and wasn't spicy at all! It met my standards for how a pad thai should look and taste. Though I ordered chicken with it, not all of the meat was properly cooked and it wasn't the best pad thai but for the cost of $7 and meeting my flavor standard, I'll definitely go back and order it again."}
{"text":"SERIOUSLY. TERRIBLE.  My office all ordered from this awful place. Took 1+ for them to make the food.. and drive down the road to give it to us. I can pretty much see this place from my office - what's taking so long?  We get the food (really late), and it turns out they overcharged us. And they forgot an order. My coworker spent twenty minutes asking them to either bring her the food or give her the money back, and they argued with her, said they would bring the food eventually, and then 30+ minutes later IT'S STILL NOT HERE. HOLY CRAP.  All the chicken and pork: overdone. My coworker says the ONLY thing that was even KIND OF decent was the pot stickers."}
{"text":"It's cheap, it's fast, it certainly is not fancy; but this is as good as it gets.    You want good asian, go to a place frequented by lots of people of european descent.  If you want autenticity go to the place that is packed with asians.  This is a Pitt/CMU tradition, and the heart of \"Asian Alley\" on Oakland Avenue.  There is no decor, it's packed in, and certinaly could use some renovations.  Save the complaints for a different style.  This is 100% authentic Szechuan chinese, and you should appreciate the complexity and style of the food served here."}
{"text":"On a random Saturday evening, my fella brought home some food from Szechuan Express. I did not have this place on my radar and didn't get any input on what we ordered so wasn't sure what to expect.  Thinking back to the meal I have a hard time finding anything memorable about the food. I know we had a noodle dish and a spicy garlic chicken dish, but nothing else really stands out about it. None of the food has as much as a kick as I would liked and they were overly saucy and oily.  I'd give them another try, but I won't go out of my way."}
{"text":"The restaurant is fairly large, there are also 2 VIP rooms available that were not being used. While we were here, three Chinese tour groups had stopped by for lunch.   FOOD: We ordered 2 dishes for the two of us, with unlimited rice bowl refills, they were pretty good! The lamb cumin was absolutely delicious the way it was, I wouldn't change anything about it. The boiled sliced fish with chili oil was made to seem big because of all the veggies on the bottom of the bowl, and wasn't as spicy as I would have expected and felt too watered down. I added the dried chili peppers from the lamb cumin and it made the boiled fish much tastier! (Needless to say though I can handle spicy dishes).   SERVICE: To admit, they were busy with tour groups coming in and out, but service was not superb. Not on top of their game, our dishes took about half an hour to get out. I had to flag a waitress down when I needed more water. Service was meh."}
{"text":"Nicest owner and staff in the city. The interior is rough but the food is AWESOME despite being ridiculously cheap and fast."}
