{"text":"LOL  Is it me or that the waiters are way sexier than other KEG's. I ordered medium rare new york steak. And it was perfect."}
{"text":"\"It's the light,\" the manager said.  Yes... the light.  Sitting around a table with eight of my closest friends, all of them having come to the unhappy conclusion that their meals were overcooked, it couldn't possibly be the horribly rough texture of the meat, or the fact that you had to slice into it like a cold, rubber tire, no.  When the manager asked how our meals were and we all pointed out they were overdone, he astutely observed that the skylight we were sitting under was playing tricks on our eyes and in fact the meals were cooked perfectly.  It was just... wait for it... the light.  He even offered to take us to another room with our meals so that we can see for ourselves.  I can only assume that all we would have seen is an uncomfortable little man whose pathetic bluff was called.

This sad story sums up the unfortunate end of a once great relationship I had with The Keg.  Anyone who grew up in and around the Toronto area has undoubtedly visited The Keg at least once.  One might even call The Keg a trendsetter in that it was one of the first midrange chain restaurants in Canada, well before Moxie's or Jack Astor's, and in its heyday, it was more about the experience of a good meal then just going through the motions.  In fact, I can recall as a kid having my dad's birthday there and the waiters singing rousing, embarrassing numbers that were downright hilarious and borderline risqu√© as far as a seven-year-old was concerned.  Maybe it's with that rosy hue of childhood memories then that The Keg fails to impress the odd time I visit now.

For the most part, the meal is nothing special now.  Sure the warm sourdough is nice, and the prime rib is decent, but it's nothing to write home about.  Bottom line, you can get a better steak for less money elsewhere.  If you're going to go, the Keg Mansion on Church has a great atmosphere and wait staff that are happy to chat up the ghost stories.  Otherwise, some of the other Kegs around the city at least have decent patios.  I'd recommend avoiding The Keg at Yonge and Sheppard at all costs though.  Everything seems to indicate it's on its last legs.

Despite us complaining about nine overcooked meals, only the birthday boy got his replaced with the final meal removed from the bill.  They also botched one of our side orders.  I tried to explain to my friend that it was actually the right side, and that it was just the light, but somehow he didn't believe me."}
{"text":"The Keg, one of the most well-known steakhouses, is due for an update, in my opinion.
Seems like the outdated chain is trying a little too hard to keep up with Canyon Creek, which offers tastier food, more food choices for the non-steak eater and a better ambience all around.
I don't hate the Keg, no one does...but it needs a refresher."}
{"text":"This place has moved to 26 The Esplanade. Not as family orineted, but the still great staff,modern decor and Keg quality food."}
{"text":"It's well done.  It's rare.

I always loved this Keg slogan from about five or so years ago.  I think it sells the \"Keg Spirit\" perfectly.  They aren't Toronto's premiere staekhouse (I'm not sure I have that kind of money), but in their price range htey dliever a consistenly delicious product and top-notch service.  That's the sort of thing you want when you're taking someone out for their first Canadian steak.

Two of us dined last night; it was the first time at The Keg in years for me and the first time ever for my companion.  We shared the goat cheese appetizer, which was absolutely delicious.  I had the peppercorn NewYork, my date had the regular New York.  Both were cooked as ordered; hers was delicious but I found mine to be a bit salty and overseasoned (even for a pepperrcorn steak).  My confidence in the professionalism of our attending server leaves me with no doubt htat had I sent it back I would have been provided with a regular New York of my own without hassle, but I preferred to keep the peace and can't find fault.  I can't emphasize enough the value of a good servier, and this guy was good.

One thing I hadn't noticed on previous visits was the wine list.  We split a bottle of Robert Mondavi's Woodbridge Cabernet-Sauvignon (delicious) but there are several other familiar options to any half-seasoned red wine drinker.  It was nice to see some familiar bottles and not feel like total winekers trying to figure out what we wanted. 

Well done.  So rare these days :)"}
{"text":"So I was thrilled about the Keg wanting to make up for a (for lack of better word) shitty experience at their restaurants. But I received the gift-card the other day and guess how kind the Keg was... They were so kind as to give me a big whopping $25 after a ruined meal for three. Making up for the experience would have been at least (absolute minimum) paying for one meal there. I ate a keg sized, medium-rare, prime-rib steak when I was there. That rings up over $26 dollars before tax. Sooo... I can't even get what I would normally eat when I go there with the gift certificate they gave me. So I gave it to a homeless person and told them to go enjoy a good meal. Hopefully he doesn't throw it away thinking it's expired or something."}
{"text":"This place is fairly high class. We got the goat cheese ap it was really good. Our steaks were cooked to perfection - medium rare- the mashed potatoes were very good too. Our server was very nice and was always around when we needed him. I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to revisit the Keg for the second week in a row recently although my most recent visit was at the hands of the Keg in the Esplanade. Definitely a more quieter, casual Keg compared toits counterpart on York street, you're likely to find more families dining in this location. Our server Ramona, was very sweet and efficient and I appreciated that she did not try to overly up-sell anything, she was professional and upfront more than anything. My friend and I had the prime rib which was tender as usual with a scrummy baked potato on the side. For dessert we split the 'Billy Miner' dessert-verrrryyy satisfying. You get a slab of mocha ice cream on top of a oreo cookie crust and topped off with toasted almonds and hot fudge and caramel on top. Dayum good."}
{"text":"Super busy Steakhouse on a Saturday night in Toronto.

I ordered an appetizer of scallops and bacon, which were close to perfect. The scallops were cooked just right and the bacon was such a nice addition. My wife ordered a chicken meal, which she loved. I got medium rare tender NY strip loin. The sides were mashed potatoes and portobello mushrooms. Everything tasted great, but the service was pretty slow and we had to flag down someone to get our waitress, so that we could pay."}
{"text":"Sadly, this location is no longer...

It by far it wasn't the best Keg I have even been too but it was convenient to say the least.

I did always find the staff to be very rude, and they seemed to purposely ignore you. It was very weird service, and the lighting was terrible. But if you make it through all the motions, the food seemed to come out okay, just okay, nothing fabulous by no means. Once in a while your steak may come out not as ordered, they are usually good about fixing it for you, some waitresses like to make it personal and give you some attitude, remember its their tip they are losing so ignore them. 

The reason they Keg left was because of a rent increase, now look the location just sits empty..."}
{"text":"This is one of the most unassuming Kegs that you'll find in the city and I really enjoy it.  I don't know why, I just do.  I like the bar, I like the booths, I like the staff, I like the meat.  If you could buy these things like cars, it's what I'd expect the entry-level Keg to look like.

The bar is off to the right of the main entrance, where the corral all of the folks that didn't have the foresight to call for a reservation.  The bar area is well equipped with a few decent taps and a good assortment of booze and appetisers for you to order as you wait.

Once seated, the table spaces and booths are what you'd expect.  Nothing ostentatious, all pretty medium.  Again, the servers are well versed on the steaks and how The Keg cooks them.  Order rare and they warn you about how rare it is.  It's not only bloody, it's bloody good.  My favourite question to be asked is \"Would you like that Keg-sized?\"  You're damn right I would."}
{"text":"Crab cakes: Why did there only have to be two?  Such a tease.  The sauce paired with it was perfection.  

Wedge Salad: The standard type of Wedge...  fantastic blue cheese dressing.  On the pungent side, but not overly so.  

Filet wrapped in bacon: Why can't I have this every day and not worry about any blossoming health predicaments?  It comes with roasted/sauteed vegetables and mushrooms - so good!  And a side.  I know it's immature to get fries with a bacon wrapped steak, but that potato/ketchup craving had hit me full force.  The fries were awesome!  

Make sure to check out one of The Keg restaurants if you're in Toronto.  I guess it's a chain there, but food snobs don't worry.  Prices are good for what you get, and the menu has many options.  Quality is great!  

Service is friendly, but I felt that they were a little fake-friendly.  I didn't encounter that at all in Toronto, otherwise.  On the contrary, I felt everyone in the city was extremely friendly and wanting to help at every chance they could in the most genuine ways I'd seen.  But hey, we were there for the food. :)"}
{"text":"In 2006, I was lucky enough to try one of the Keg's speciality martinis - a lychee martini.  It was the most amazing drink I've ever had. They used REAL lychees in the actual martini.  Holy ish.  Being from Chicago, you definitely don't see any 'exotic' fruits in any drinks here.  So, my friends and I were psyched.  

In the 2 weeks we were out here for business, we came here 3 times.  Life changing.  Honestly.  I talked about that drink forever."}
{"text":"I love the kids. But to be honest this location is simply too dark especially at lunch time"}
{"text":"Ordered medium rare and got a well cooked steak... Disappointing for a steakhouse right? Still they reacted quickly and successfully. Ok I guess. Nice terasse."}
