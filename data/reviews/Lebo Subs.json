{"text":"Big sandwiches. with high quality meats, and fresh vegies - for a good price. What else could you want?"}
{"text":"This is a cool little spot with great subs. It's never super crowded so it's easy to get in and out quickly. It's a little on the expensive side but the quality is worth it. My fav is the chicken philly. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite sub shop. The meats are absolutely amazing when fresh sliced. I can't say enough good things about the meats. I always get my sub made \"Jersey style\" and it's perfect. The bread is also very good and the serving sizes are just right. Nice people in a cool and laid-back setting."}
{"text":"I do not get the good reviews of this place.  Subs are bland bland bland.   It was like eating a paper plate.   Won't return."}
{"text":"It's great they opened a new sammich shop near me. The subs were good, reasonably priced and not always crowded. I would recommend this to a friend."}
{"text":"Food is great but a tad expensive but it is all fresh and delicious.  The people are awesome and especially the one girl, Madison, she always knows what I want when I walk in the door and she's so friendly.  Nice to see a young person work so hard.  This is a great lunch or dinner spot as the service is fast and there's never too much of a wait.  They also sell their deli meats as lunch meat so an added bonus!!"}
{"text":"i lived in south florida for 5 years and ironically the only business i ever walked up to with a locked door was laspada subs in boca raton/obviously the owner is from pittsburgh. \"buy local\" \"support independent businesses\". whomever closes a sub shop at 8pm doesn't take their work seriously. rather, they run a typical pittsburgh \"bankers hours\" business. to add even more insult, the owner doesn't even bother to post his hours on the window? i walked past 2 other restaurants that were still open and headed to panera where i was pleased to read they will be no GMO by year end. and of course, where i will buy all of my take out sandwiches going forward. no wonder why so may independent businesses lose to chains."}
{"text":"This is a really good sandwich shop. I often crave their sandwiches and drive in to MtL and pay to park just to eat lunch here. Service is quick, the people are friendly, and the place is clean. What else can you ask for?  A couple of suggestions: It's a tad bit expensive (the half Italian hoagie combo is $11!)  And their \"frequent visitor\" program is confusing. It's not clear how the points get earned or how to redeem. I've eaten here a handful of times and I still don't know when I'll get my free sub, or exactly how the system works."}
{"text":"Meat and cheese sliced to order and a really awesome staff on my most recent visit.  Definitely worth a visit and a repeat visit at that."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times now. If you like jersey mikes or firehouse you will love this place. Fast, high quality, and delicious. Parking can be tough, but find a side street and walk."}
{"text":"That's a good mutha sandwich! I had one of the in house made roast beef sandwiches and was very impressed. I don't know if they make their bread in house as well, but it was some of the best bread I have had for a sub. I have always said better bread better subs. You have to swing in here and check it out. The sandwiches are simple, but shoot if you make a sandwich this straight forward and it kicks this much butt, who needs anything else. I'm not really sure if the \"fresh cut\" meats make a difference but it certainly adds to the experience. I think this could really be a five star place if their sides were a little bit better. I tried the potatoe salad and was disappointed as there really wasn't much to it and it was just bland. Fries would go great with these subs to."}
{"text":"I always love supporting the home team, rather than a national chain.  I can never go back to Subway or Quizo's after trying Lebo Subs.  It's just a darn good sammich, and the team member who takes your order actually slices the meat and cheese to order!!.  I have tried the Lebo, the Spicy Ham, the roast beef and the meatball.  I have never been disappointed.  Lebo Subs Rocks!!"}
{"text":"We love this place. My son pics it for his birthday dinner every year. A favorite is the meatball sub with provolone. My daughter and I share a sub filled with veggies."}
{"text":"Lebo stubs is your typical standard deli. They carve the meat fresh to order unlike subway, which I like. The menu is small, but straight to the point. I get the Italian which seems to have a good bit of meat. Their prices seem a little expensive, but once you see how large the subs are, it makes total sense. The half is big enough for two people to share if you get chips or a side to go along with it. I really enjoy the oil, vinegar and Oregano dressing they make. The staff is friendly and they move quick when making the subs. Lebo subs also offers free wifi, which is always a plus. One thing I wish they had was a toaster, but I don't believe they do.  If you're looking for a decent deli sandwich in Mt. lebanon, this your spot."}
{"text":"Great subs, friendly staff and high quality deli meats and cheeses \"to go\"... what's not to love? HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"I have been it Pittsburgh for 7 years looking for a decent Sub to no avail until now.   The Lebo Subs sammiches are the real deal. Great bread and meat prepared by the store. The owner is great and the staff is well trained and friendly. I cant wait for the gas company to stop screwing around with them so I can try the hot sammiches and soup.  Check them out, you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"This is one of the few places in the area where you can get a legit jersey style sub. And they're amazing. They cut their meat fresh for every sub which makes a world of difference. Best sub I've had since I moved to the area three years ago and I've tried a lot of places!"}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere. I'm here on a Wednesday at 12:00 noon and I'm the only one here? Weird. Food is a very bland but it's a cool concept to slice your meat right as you order. Price is okay for this area, and a half a sub is huge. Unfortunately it's all lettuce and lacks flavor. It's one of those places you want to support but they really need to step up their menu and ingredients in my opinion."}
{"text":"sub was decent but falls way short of the jersey style deli.  the bread was soft and not a traditional hard sub roll.  meat and cheese were excellent quality but the sandwich was a little bland and the bread really ruined it.  that said it is still light years above many sub shops around here.  if you've never been to a traditional new jersey deli and have no comparison you'll probably enjoy it just fine but if you have you're probably better off at jersey mikes."}
{"text":"Average subs at above average prices. I got an Italian and the most they offered was \"jersey style\" with vinegar and oil.  My friend got the turkey and provolone. We asked to have the subs hot, but were told they don't do that. Friendly people but absolutely nothing special."}
{"text":"Great little sandwich shop in Mt Lebanon. I'll definitely be back.   You place your order, collect your food and pay at the counter for either eat-in or take out. They have plenty of tables. It was pretty filled up on a Saturday afternoon, but I got a table.   I ordered a half roast beef sandwich. Everything was very fresh and well prepared. The quality of the roast beef was excellent and bread very fresh.  The half sandwich is plenty large enough for one person. They prepare the sandwich as you watch and you have a choice of all the standard toppings.   I also got a side of potato salad. This is a home made salad and also very fresh and well prepared. The serving was a little small but adequate as a side with the sandwich.   Prices are reasonable and service friendly. My sandwich and side came to about $10."}
{"text":"Just got my first sandwich here & WOW was the best sub i've had in a while, fresh meat & cheese sliced to order, fresh veggies & seasoned perfectly, guys working were freindly & quick, will definitely be back SOON"}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop in mount Lebanon. Always fresh ingredients, always friendly service. Jersey style sandwiches, but you can get it your way. I think the prices are good for the quality, I go often and will continue to!"}
{"text":"First of all, I don't just give 5 stars because I expect 5 stars to be more than good and service to be better than average. So...I will admit walking in and for there to be no customers and only seeing 1 guy working made me think twice if I just made a mistake. I was immediately greeted and when I asked what was good he was honest. Got a Philly cheesesteak...he added all my requested fixins. I got wedding soup as well. I was staying at the local hotel and walked my food back. My soup was very hot and for being late in the evening it wasn't too salty and tasted great. I didn't feel like I got the last of the pot...great surprise. My sandwich was hot and delish.  The bread was fresh not stale...again it was late and you can always tell you got day old bread...not here. Sandwich was dressed like requested. Service was quick and he was kind. Plus, he packed my items up nicely. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Service with a smile does not seem to be their fort√®. The minute we walked into the establishment we were dissapointed by the lack of greeting by the unenthusiastic teenage employees, not even attempting to say hello. We were then rushed in to orering our food, even though we were their only customers at the time. We ordered two cheese steaks and a meatball sub, all half hoagies too. We were shocked when our total reached almost $30. After that when looking for a table we relized that the clever and interesting fassad was covered in crumbs and dirt. What a shame. The first bite into my skimpy meatball sub, or should I say, a marinara sauce sandwich, wad disappointing because I was constantly fighting off the annoying crunch of the corn-meal type seeds. By the time I was done I realized that there was probably only one meatball total applied to the inside of the sandwich. For $10 I would expect more. The steak hoagie was dull and tasteless. The best thing about the place was the fountain coke and the pictures of old time Lebo that dawned the walls. Besides that, it was a terribly disappointing meal. New employees and food selections are needed."}
{"text":"I love trying different sandwich shops for lunch and this one was... just ok. I'd eat here again in the area and looking for a sandwich,  but I might just decide to get something else, other than a sandwich.    I arrived about 11:45am and I was alarmed to see that I was the only one in the shop. Maybe it was early and a bit cold out so people were staying in but still, no one.   I got the cold Italian, Jersey Style.  I took their recommendations for the vinegar, oil, salt, pepper and oregano. It was tasty! The meat was sliced fresh. I enjoyed that!  I also got the pasta salad as my side. When she was scooping it out,  I changed my mind (intetnally) and wanted the potato salad. I didn't say anything lol I just ate the pasta salad. I personally thought it was a bit bland. It taste like they put vinegar,  oil,  salt, pepper,  and oregano in it lol same as the sandwich.    The atmosphere was cute! With some rough cut wood and large paintings on the walls."}
{"text":"I came here and ordered a half of an Italian sub ($8.35).  The staff was friendly, but the sandwich was just passable. I really liked that they sliced the deli meat as they made the sandwich, but I found the bread to only be passable.  This definitely does not match Uncle Sam's or Peppi's in the city, but it is a step above Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"The best subs in Pittsburgh. Jersey Style is the best. As good a sub as you can find away from the east coast."}
{"text":"My favorite spot to grab a turkey hoagie in the Mt. Lebanon area. The food is consistently good and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"My hot sandwich was excellent. I'm quite puzzled why they don't have a toaster oven to heat up or grill other sandwiches. And when I asked why I got a rather rude response. So... idk. The meatball was good but cold sandwiches suck when not grilled."}
{"text":"I call myself a \"regular \" at Lebo Subs , But never had a chance to tell the YELP world. What a GREAT Find this small sub shop is. Nestled in the heart of Mt. Lebanon this is really a hidden gem. What a FAST & Friendly staff. Excellent selection and the absolute BEST Sub I have ever ordered ! I usually get the Italian Sub and a Cookie. Tonight I actually had to eat only half . because it's sooo freekin huge ! Everything if super fresh and very high quality. As I've said a million times , I LOVE supporting these small businesses here in beautiful Pittsburgh.  Honestly ., If you really want to try something different and 300 percent better that subway, you gotta try Lebo Sub's  Almost impossible to find a place to park , but well worth the effort. PLEASE People , Lets keep these small wonderful Pittsburgh traditions alive and well."}
{"text":"Definitely not the best sub I ever had, but definitely not the worst either. I got the club and it was just okay. It was pretty bland. I didn't think the meat or bread had much flavor. However, I got the half a sub and it was huge. I can't imagine how big the whole is. The place was clean and the staff was friendly and quick at making the subs. My friend got the Italian and she really likes hers. I'd give this place another try, but I'll order something different."}
{"text":"This place has changed my life. There is a before and an after moment in my life at the time I discovered Lebo Subs. These are the subs served in heaven."}
{"text":"Great sub shop! This is our second time going and we always love what we get! Really fresh ingredients, great bread, friendly and fast service.  The person who took our order asked if we wanted the sub jersey style and explained what it was. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food, but I have to give it a four because of the misleading, \"Hot or Cold\" motto. They do not have hot subs. I was told it's because the meatballs are hot, a bit misstated in my opinion. Besides that, the turkey sub was very good."}
{"text":"Great place for a made to order sub with high quality ingredients! It's a favorite when meeting former coworkers during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Meh.  It's just OK.  The actual meats and such are great, so that is why I'm giving it 3 stars.  The bread though - extremely mediocre.  If they could fix that, and improve their counter help, they'd be much better off.  The ordering and pick up experience was weird.  We were greeted and the employee was friendly enough.  But, after being handed our sub's, I had to ask for the sodas I had ordered.  No big deal, but the employee just said, \"oh just reach over there and grab them\"!  Odd, I thought"}
{"text":"Lebo Subs is amazing. High quality, friendly staff and the owner who cares about not only the food and business, but the community. The food is why you come to a restaurant right??? Well this place does not disappoint. I don't even want to bring up Subway, but I have to. Why? Why would anyone go to Subway when Lebo Subs exists in Mt. Lebanon????!!???!? Please do not go to Subway and do all your sub shopping here where the ingredients are fresh and the people care."}
{"text":"Very excited to see such a quality upcoming business in my home town. Ordered the Chicken Philly and was not disappointed at all. All the ingredients are top notch and the flavor is authentic. The price is solid and the portion HUGE; be sure to order a HALF if eating for one. The owners also did a very nice job with the interior making the setting a great place to enjoy your meal. Another great aspect is that you can buy the deli meats and cheeses for home, you could make this your new deli!"}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly and the food is fresh. Much better than subway and at comparable prices. They also serve soda via bottle."}
{"text":"My first time here and it was a good experience. They carved all the meats and the cheese to order. I ordered the roast beef and it was great quality. The only downside is that they didn't have many condiments for their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Thought it was a pretty awesome local sub shop. Enjoyed the sub I had a whole Italian on wheat and it was really good. I will recommend this to friends and family if they visit or live around here. If I make it back this way I will visit again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Fresh bread, good quality meat and cheese sliced to each individual order. Great place to go for lunch. I prefer Lebo Subs to any of the big chain sandwich shops. The staff is always friendly and the service is always fast. I have never had a bad experience or sandwich here!  I always like to get the special of the day when I go. It's a nice way to try all of the different sandwiches they have!"}
{"text":"The former space of a long-time art dealer has been usurped by a cabal of young bohemians with a passion for the almighty grinder, the sensational submarine, the hallowed hero, the zealous zep, and the bulk of their craft is scratch-made from the bread to the roast beef.   It was the latter that had me salivating, particularly when I was told that there would be a wait since the protein in question was still cooking and the just-baked bread was cooling.   While the meat ended up being slightly dry, I savored the fresh, flaky bread, the artistically laid array of vegetables ( I went berserk with my choices), and the \"Jersey Style\" vinegar/oil/salt/oregano dressing which was what truly shot the torpedo across the ocean and into Jared Fogle's yacht. One hearty hoagie, my only lament was that I didn't go with an Italian since I feel it probably would have been more succulent.  A cup of potato salad proved to be a starchy, creamy success with a bit of celery bringing the crunch. The M&M chocolate chip cookies we had for dessert were crispy, chewy caps of joy that rivaled those of many area bakeries.   I must add that the interiors are bright, contemporary, and inviting, the soda fountain is self-serve, the employees are enthusiastic and engaging, and the meat is sliced to order.   Subway sinks to the ocean floor to be devoured by a Kraken as Blimpie's falls burning from the sky.  The age of Lebo Subs is upon us."}
{"text":"Nice new little classic sammich shop that cuts the meat fresh, bakes the bread, and cook their own roast beef.  In the next week or so there will be homemade soup.  The sammiches are topped \"Jersey Style' with lettuce, onion, tomato, vinegar, oil, salt and oregano, unless you request to not have the toppings.  You can add a few additional toppings such as slice pickle, peppers. There is a Veggie sammich on the menu but did not read what it would have on it.  Had the Lebo with swiss, turkey, ham roast beef and bacon with some chips.  The sammich was very tasty. Will have to stop by and try a soup and sandwich."}
{"text":"Got the chicken salad sub. I guess the chicken salad was good. I couldn't really taste it. There was hardly any chicken salad on the sub. Mostly lettuce so that was pretty much all I could taste."}
{"text":"Happy to discover a non-chain subs option in the neighborhood (I know Badamo down the street is awesome, but they're a bit limited in the traditional cold-cut department).  Nice people, nice service, and good, solid food. The subs are $1-2 more than what I would look for in a place to visit more regularly, but I can't really argue with the spin these folks have taken on the Jersey Mike's formula. Meat's cut to order, toppings added as you wish, and the results were a winner at my place. Line was a little slow the day I stopped in, but that's because they were taking care of customers, not slacking and simply waiting out the timeclock.  Menu and seating may be a little too limited for some, but I think there's enough of both here to give everyone an option that works for them. Pasta salad was an excellent side to add into the mix.  I hope this place sticks as an option in downtown Lebo. I'll certainly stop in again."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches. Well worth the price. They staff is very nice as well. I've slowly become a regular here and I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Lebo Subs! We order from here multiple times per month.  If you call ahead, they will have your subs ready and waiting when you arrive.  They accidentally hooked us up with half of a meatball sub once, but I swear it was the best mistake ever.  The meatball subs are AMAZING!! I rarely get meatball subs anywhere because it is rare to find a really good one.    Get a meatball sub, I promise - you won't be disappointed!"}
