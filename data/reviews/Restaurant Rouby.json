{"text":"Rouby provides some authentic Lebanese/Armenian styled cuisine. The menu is quite big with a huge variety of hot and cold mezzes (tapas) as well as a variety of cooked meats to yourself indulge in. The menu is ideally suited to be shared in a friend or family setting.  My extended family knows of this place quite well over the years as they've all been here in past events for birthdays/weddings or special dinners at some point in their lives. My recent visit is nothing so exciting however and  I brought some work colleagues with me to introduce them to this type of cuisine.   Here's my opinion on the plates that we shared:   Hummus : Excellent! (5 stars). This menu item tends to be prepared so differently in a variety of cuisines but the Armenian way... is the best way! :)  Fattouch : Fantastic!!! (5+ stars). My favorite salad without a doubt and Rouby does it justice. The salad ingredients are fresh, the fried pita pieces crunchy (freshly prepped) and the dressing makes this dish really come together. Truly spectacular.  Soujouk : Decent 3/5. Soujouk (or sujuk depending where you're from) is a dry, spicy sausage that I swear is always prepped different at every single restaurant that services it. Unfortunately, I wasn't overly fond with the version provided here, a bit too dry for my taste and the portion less than expected.  Meat Plate : Good (3/5). We took a family plate which consisted of 1 stick of kafta, shish-taouk and filet mignon. The meats were good, I was especially fond of the filet mignon. The plate comes with a selection of salad or fries/rice.   Service is friendly albeit a little standoffish. Good was prepared quickly and efficiently.  The establishment is clean and well presented, our banquet table was comfortable.  Overall the food is good, with some of my particular tastes showing clear bias in my opinion of them, some of the mezze plates are not as generous as they should be and this went in particular for the Soujouk which didn't fill out a full plate. I also regularly find plates of meat at Lebanese restaurants being quite overpriced. The meat plate which was close to $25 only held 3 sticks of meat and anyone knows we could get these at Adonis for about $2 to $3 dollars each. I would hope to see more generous portions in the meat plates but alas that challenges seems to be seen everywhere.  Conclusion? Worthy of a taste, try it out and enjoy this cuisine."}
{"text":"Fantastic family run business. Excellent filet mignon kebab, chi keufteh, and appetizers. Service is friendly and courteous (usually by the owners daughters and the owner himself). They serve one of my favourite beers; almaza. This place is approoriate for large parties (family style platters). I believe you can rent out the whole place if you have a fairly large party"}
{"text":"The food and service is great here. I'm actually surprise there is no other reviews. Casual place. Great for takeout."}
