{"text":"I had the lamb gyro here as well as the Turkish coffee, and both were very good, but the service was absolutely atrocious. I might be persuaded to try it again but the reviews seem to be pretty consistent."}
{"text":"I love the food. I rated this location lower because I ate my meal in the restaurant here and didn't have a great experience, and because it didn't seem as good of a $ value here. Every Friday I think it is there's a belly dancer, and it was just loud and awkward (so sensual for public, sheesh!). That's my fault, I should've come a different day. 

Also you should know that they don't open right on the hour. I came at opening time to try the Turkish coffee and they didn't open for another half hour maybe. 

The owner is friendly, nice guy!"}
{"text":"We went there in the winter when they first opened because Picolo Forno had too long of a wait.    The service was slow, the food came out cold and the prices were double what they should have been."}
{"text":"From what I gathered this location is used mostly for events and private parties, therefore hours are limited, but they are open Thursday thru Saturday nights.  There was only one person working in total--he was cooking, serving, & cleaning. This led to slow service, but we weren't in any rush. The owner was friendly which made up for the 'relaxed' service. 

We were pleasantly surprised at how delicious the food was. We shared an meze platter with hummus, baba, several types of eggplant, roasted peppers, butter bean,  & kidney bean salads, beets, cole slaw, carrot slaw, etc. The owners hot sauce was especially good as was the tzatziki. This was enough to fill us up for dinner, but we followed this with the chicken kabobs which were so tender and so tasty, not to mention the perfectly cooked pilaf.  

We're happy to find another hidden gem in Pittsburgh and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here around 9:30 on a Friday night. We ordered two dishes to go, the istanbul salad and an eggplant and lamb dish. Everything was ready in about 10 minutes. The restaurant was moderately busy for that time too. The staff was friendly and astute. The food was delicious. Especially the fresh sesame seed bread they packed with our meal. My only complaint, which is why I'm giving them a 3/5 instead of a 4/5 is that the prices was kind of high for what we got. Neither of us was too hungry, but the two dishes came to over $30 bucks. We spent $15 on a salad full of parsley, tomatoes, and some feta cheese. That was alittle too much in my opinion. If we would have each had a salad and a dinner, our bill would have been over $70."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with some friends. The waitress told us that most of the items on the menu were unavailable because of a problem with pipes breaking and damaging their refrigerators. Their selection of entrees was cut to about 5 items. They nicely offered us some free appetizers to make up for it. 

The waitress brought all but one of the entrees, mine, shortly after the appetizers. My entree did not show up. After several minutes, we asked one of the waitresses if my meal was coming. She said it would be just a minute and she would get it. After 20 more minutes, no one had come back by our table and our waitress was ignoring our attempts to get her to come over. To get my meal, I had to walk to the counter and remind them again that my food had not come. By this time, everyone else at my table had finished their meals and I was extremely hungry. Finally, my food came out, although it was missing one of the sides that normally comes with it and the food was slightly burnt. They did not charge me for my meal and tried to make up for the situation by bringing us stale baklava. 

This was the worst experience I've had there. Other times have been better, but the service is usually shoddy and they never have all the items on the menu. The food is, at best, okay. I would recommend against going there. The downtown location may be better."}
{"text":"Really nice place. When I came in in need of takeout on a Sat afternoon when NOTHING else seemed to be open, they offered to make me a sandwich to order - Turkish meatballs with cucumber, tomato, and yogurt sauce - and it was delicious and not badly priced (about 6.50 or so). The service was also incredibly friendly and fast. Definitely worth a stop in."}
{"text":"First of all, I am a huge fan of Istanbul Grille downtown on Liberty.  I was extremely excited when I heard they would be taking over the Your Inner Vagabond space.  They do the space a great justice and easily make better use of the front and fill a restaurant niche in Laurenceville that Inner Vagabond simply could not.

That said, it pains me to give the food & service here 3 stars.  Service can be spotty, the servers and owners are extremely friendly but possibly just a touch too laid back, leaving some tables to inevitably be neglected.

The food here is delicious, but the dinner menu is lacking.  It seems as though they have taken the tasty lunch take out options from the downtown location and added a few dollars and a larger helping.  This simply won't cut it for dinner, they need to bring back the entree options from their first location.

Anyhow, I really enjoyed this place and the downtown location is excellent but this one could do with a slight menu overhaul."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant!  Food was excellent.  I can't wait to go back.  The \"Okra\" entree was excellent!!  Service may have been a little slow, but that's ok with me, because the food was so good!"}
