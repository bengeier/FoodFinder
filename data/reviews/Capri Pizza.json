{"text":"I hardly ever recommend Pizza, because everybody is so opinonated with their likes and dislikes .... Let me tell you, every bite of the pizza is crunchy yet chewy, topped with flavorful sauce and toppings.
I live 20min away , but I would drive over an hour to get this pie! and the guys that work there- real nice!"}
{"text":"Excellent thin crust pizza and very good pizza rolls and calzones. My sons' favorite place. Doesn't travel well, though, so we almost always eat it there."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the largest and yummiest calazones that I have ever had.  Owner was extremely nice to this out of towner and gave me highlights to visit in his city!  I highly recommend this friendly place."}
{"text":"Very good cheese pizza.  Thin crust with a bit of char.  I dined in, and the owner and his assistant left out the back door for the last 10 minutes I was there.  Strange.  I grabbed my own to-go box off the counter and left."}
{"text":"They stays open late just for us to get a to go pizza! You have amazing employees! Thank you Capri Pizza! Craig rocks !!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great if you're going to the movies in the same plaza.  Great prices on sheet pizza too.  I've moved further away from this place but still end up there on occasion."}
{"text":"Some of the best New York Style pizza in the cleveland area. Tons of deals (especially the 14\" one topping pizza for $9 on Thursdays!) and a lot of different, delicious pizzas on the menu! If you're coming here expecting to show off the signed publicity photo of eighties metal band Warrant to your friends, quit while you're ahead, they took it down. =\ One star was removed as a result."}
{"text":"NY style pizza like back home in NJ. Possibly the best pizza in Cleveland. Thin crispy crust and great sauce. The chef was really nice and let us try a meatball. It was all beef and delicious. Will definitely get that as a topping next time.

Be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland area from AZ, wanted some local pizza instead of the large chains. Good call! (All three of us agreed while watching Thursday night football). Great 18\" XL pizza, chewy baked crust with a touch of crispness. Was ready soon for pickup, decent price. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Easily the best New York thin crust pizza in Cleveland. Would give anyplace in Manhattan a run for their money."}
{"text":"I grew up just outside of NYC and can confirm... this place ACTUALLY has New York style pizza.  Best Pizza I've had in Ohio!  No comparison.

The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because the physical pizzeria is awkward, small, and a little dingy."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Many choices. Great side salads. Always tons of dipping sauce. Not to mention the pizza is awesome!"}
{"text":"What  to do when on the road, exhausted and feeling down...? order a pizza of course!

I was impressed at the prompt delivery (under twenty minutes!!) as well as the pizza quality. The crust was crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, the sauce was savory and thick, the toppings fresh and not overcooked. I had ordered jalapenos on the side, which unfortunately didn't make it to us with the pizza. It was a shame, but we shrugged it off and dug in happily

about ten minutes later theres a knock on the door. The delivery guy had realised he forgot the jalapenos, went back to the shop to get them, and returned with them, without us calling or asking. I was impressed. Now THATS service!

If you want to pig out on a well made pie, call capri!"}
{"text":"Never again will I come here. $3.95 for a slice of pizza. And I ordered a large Pizza here once and it was well over $30 and there were only a few items. And then they have the audacity to put a tip jar at the counter. Sorry but you need to pay your employees well when you are charging these outrageous prices! And don't expect me to tip on takeout!"}
{"text":"Capri pizza is one of the nice small places that serve basic italian food and are reasonably priced. It has all the ingredients of a small mom and pop shop. They have some good selection but mostly two or three options are ready to be warmed up. 

Pizza is okay quality and taste. Nothing special about it. The slice size is good."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite pizza joint in all of Cleveland.  This place is rocking a true New York style Neapolitan pie with a perfect crust and zesty sauce.

If you want big, floppy, greasy, cheesy slices of pizza...you came to the right place!  Make sure to check them out on Tuesday's \"customer Appreciation\" day for some great prices on slices and whole pies.  This is one of my go-to lunch spots when I'm jones-ing for a slice!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars
     Every time I go here the staff is painfully slow. The food however is pretty good. They have New York style pizza and every so often I get a taste for it. The place is a little disheveled but it's a pizzeria not a church. Soda is bought by the bottle, no soda fountain. If they could pick up their pace and increase customer service this would get 4 stars from me."}
{"text":"If you enjoy New York style pizza, this is the place to go! They feature the large pizzas with huge slices, you can even buy a slice to go for lunch! Their sauce is amazing and I have always had superb customer service here! If your in the area to catch a movie stop here first and grab a pizza for dinner before your flick! 
We always do the plane Jane cheese and pepperoni, but they do offer many specialties here!"}
{"text":"Loved this place as a kid.  Brings back memories and still tastes as good as it did back then.  New York Style pizza by the pie or slice.  Does not get any better than this. Wish they had one in Texas!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about Capri. Working with a big group of volunteers for a children's home at Christmas, on short notice the owner whipped up 2 sheet pizzas, 2 XL pizzas and two pans of salad and saved the day for us. Even comped the second XL pizza when he heard what we were doing. To top it off, pizza was fantastic, and everyone raved about it. Leftovers went home with some of the volunteers and nothing was wasted. Thank you Capri! You have new fans and customers!"}
{"text":"No frills, not fancy...just fabulous pizza.  If you are a thin crust lover you won't have to search any further. Crispy and chewy at the same time with a fresh tomato sauce for the base -- then add your favs from there."}
{"text":"I can't believe that there are actually bad reviews on here for Capri. You can't please everyone, I suppose. Capri has the biggest pizzas I've ever seen. Their NY style 18-inch pizza is massive, and the crust is crispy and chewy at the same time, and not too thick (I hate thick crust). The sauce is awesome, they use tons of cheese and the pepperoni tastes like they've actually been cut in the store (although I don't think it is). On Tuesdays, you can get one of the 18 inch cheese pizzas for $8 (add a buck fifty for toppings.). Give them extra time on Tuesdays, though, bc they're usually really busy. They do not offer delivery either, but it's worth picking up. Yum!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and friendly service. One of the better pizza joints in the CLE area"}
{"text":"The folks here are super nice.  The service is great.  The pizza is good.  Do yourself a favor though and get a fresh pie.  They're a bit tastier.  They do at times put too many toppings on and the dough gets soggy .... nothing a few minutes in the oven can't cure.  All in all it's a good pizza joint that's very homey."}
{"text":"We ordered a large pepperoni.  While waiting  for the pizza we got entertained by two workers ...one Complaining  and then other telling the first one to stop the complaining, but using a few choice cuss words.  I have heard my share of cuss words before, but I had my four year old grandson with me. 

When I went to get the pizza,  it looked over cooked.  Once we took a bite, it was definitely over cooked. The crust was brittle,  which is not good for Brooklyn style, you should be able to fold the slice. The only soft area on the pizza was the cheese.

The side salad was okay, if you like alot of vegetables and barely any lettuce."}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice makes it a perfect fit for lunch. Staff was friendly and having a good time when I arrived. Sets the tone as a nice laid back place.  Plus the pizza was excellent!"}
{"text":"Amazing slices of New York style pizza that nobody else in the Cleveland metro area does quite as well.  I've enjoyed it since I was a kid.  Also by the slice during the day for the working lunch crowd."}
{"text":"Damn fine pizza. No more looking around for pizza joints this is the real deal!!!!! Got the large pizza with sausage and mushrooms, and let me yell you the sausage is spot on with flavor and texture.  Perefect foldable slices with great  crust made me so happy to find this joint. I can't wait to order some more!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is fantastic. The customer service and cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired.  The pizza is very reasonably priced and they have very accommodating combo meals. As far as places that sell by the slice you'd be hard-pressed to find a better one in Northeast Ohio. I think they could really be great if they would just clean up the place a little bit and improve on their customer service. It hasn't had a makeover in many years. 

$1 slices on Tuesday"}
{"text":"The pizza here is about as close as you're going to get to New York Style pie in Northeast Ohio, and the prices are quite reasonable compared to what you'll pay at such food court favorites as Sbarro and Villa. The owner is also very friendly and attentive the customers. In addition to pizza, you can get Calzones, which are  great!"}
{"text":"If you like New York style pizza, Capri's is fantastic! However, if you like calzones, I don't think it is possible to make them any better than what you will find here. I love calzones and get them at any pizza place that serves them. At Capri's, you get three toppings, plus loads of cheese and plenty of dipping sauce, which is good because the calzone is massive. It is literally a large pizza folded in half and then baked in their oven. If you can eat the whole thing in one sitting, you are a man amongst boys. When I return to Cleveland to visit family, I'm stopping here for a calzone!"}
{"text":"Disappointing for me.  Nice people, prompt with the order being ready but NY pizza.....not!  I travel for work so ordered a 14\" pie based on the yelp reviews.  Now I lived in NJ most of my life and worked in every NY borough.  This is not NY pizza, not even close.  My only thought is do they use the same dough for 14\" as they do for 18\"?  The reason I ask is my pie was not thin, crispy and tasty NY style at all."}
{"text":"Capri has been around for a long time. Thirty-some years ago they used to be THE pizza place in Great Northern until all knowing management closed it in favor of a Sbarro. Capri moved around locations and landed at this spot a while ago. The original owners sold to someone who did fine for a number of years, but recently management/ownership has changed and Capri original pizza is BACK- and it is DELICIOUS!!!! New tall skinny Italian guy making pizza's and answering the phone used to work at the Great Northern location and he has brought his mad pizza making skills to Middleburg Hts. They have a refreshed interior and the awesome pizza they used to have in the 80's. Thin floppy cheesy slices with a crunch bottom- YUM. Way to go tall, skinny Italian guy. You have brought Capri back in a great way! By the way they have great specials too!"}
{"text":"I love pizza and by far Capri pizza is best all around its untouchable great New York style pizza"}
{"text":"Awesome NY style pizza. The owner is the same guy there from  20+ years ago. Best pizza and meatballs and garlic wings in CLE hands down! Only qualm - lasagna was not good on a recent visit. Otherwise, definitely eat here~! They have a great Sunday and Tuesday night customer appreciation pizza special, talking 1980 pricing. Absolutely love Capri pizza!!"}
{"text":"The \"New York Style\" pizza is not what you get in NYC.  The cheese and garlic bread are edible, but not much more.  The chicken topping just ruins the pizza, so avoid it.  Actually it's probably better to eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Having grown up on Long Island, I still miss two things: good bagels and good pizza. I still can't find a good east coast bagel; however, I have found the closest thing to a good pizza here at Capri. Clearly, the NY method is used here - the dough, the sauce and the cheese are perfect! I can't rave enough about it. If you want real NY style pizza, this is the only place to go."}
{"text":"I have searched the Northeast Ohio region high and low

In search of that three ingredient hankering 
I have time to time 

Yes it's 

Crust---Sauce---Cheese

Closest I can find to Neapolitan  pizza anywhere in Northeast Ohio thanks to Rob who knows how to rock that pie

He provides excellent customer service total attentiveness and ownership responsibility for that particular store

I travel from Adina for that pizza on a constant basis
A small detour right off 71 and Bagley Road is so convenient as well as no  matter how busy they maintain a very high level of service, Quality product and positive experience

Excellent job............ Rob"}
{"text":"Wow- That's a big pizza! 18 inches. People drive around on tires smaller than that!  It's a New York style hand tossed pie and the crust was very good.  I ordered the deluxe meat and could tell all of the toppings were of great quality. The toppings had alot of flavor when compared to most other pizza places. The quantity of toppings was impressive as well. All-in-all it was good eats. 

Some of my concerns:
The pizza was SO HUGE the box wouldn't fit into my refrigerator until I removed everything including the shelves. Can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow. 
It was a bit greasy but was likely a result of the toppings I chose. 
The manager was MFing a customer that just left to another employee. New York style? 

They've got a Thursday special- 
14\" one topping pizza for $7.95. So...  Try it!"}
{"text":"Best NY Style Pizza in Cleveland.  Been buying pizza here  for a long long time.  I remember when they were in the Food court at Great Northern Mall.  This place is a hidden gem.   Highly recommend Capri Pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza, Excellent Service, Awesome Location. 
Make sure you are hungry because they are generous with portions"}
{"text":"If you are craving a New York Style pizza and just can't make it out to NYC...Capri is the next best pizza!"}
{"text":"In fairness, I'm updating my review as at the end of the day I think Capri makes a good pizza. The problem is this: Capri leaves their slices sit out entirely too long. No pizza place in NYC would do this, rather they would throw it away. I decided the best course of action was to order a small pizza and have something fresh. It was great!  So to sum up Capri: if you go in non-peak lunch or dinner hours order a whole pie. Never get slices unless it's peak hours."}
{"text":"The only place in Cleveland that has true New York style pizza and it is awesome. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. We love this place."}
{"text":"Growing up in the western suburbs of Cleveland, your choice of shopping malls was either Parmatown or Great Northern. When I went to Great Northern and it was lunch or dinner time,  I almost always got Capri Pizza that was located in the food court.  No longer at the mall, I was excited to see it re-open in Middleburg Heights.

Pizza comes two ways. Neapolitan (thin crust hand tossed) which is my favorite or Sicilian  (thick crust pan).  You can get it by the slice or order an entire pie. 

Many say it's the closest thing to New York pizza you can get ib NE Ohio."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a New York pizza place for a long time and finally decided to make the 45 minute drive out the the West Side from Chagrin Falls. It was worth it! The pizza was crispy crust, hot, fresh, perfect \"sag\" and just plain delicious! Everything you would expect in a slice of New York pizza. Staff was friendly and fast, we were there at noon on  Saturday."}
{"text":"Being a transplant from NYC is near impossible to fine a good pizza place like I grew up with. Whelp this is the place. I drove from Rocky River to eat here. This is the best Neapolitan pizza I've been able to find.  The large pizza is truly a large coming in at 18 inches... not 10 inches.  The crust is thin and crispy and never soggy.  This place deserves the title of \"Now that you've tried the rest try the best\""}
{"text":"Pizza is excellent very affordable, pies are huge, thin crispy dough, sauced just right, if thou want a taste of New York I highly recommend it, they don't skimp out on the cheese either. Crust was delicious wife usually doesn't east crust I took a few bites & she was already asking for my crust which I love crust but hey can't disappoint the wife. My mother who is very picky loved it I was really impressed how attentive the owner & the staff was with all their customers, even when on the phone you can really feel how genuine & passionate they were taking orders.

I really liked when the owner came out & take a few minutes out of his busy schedule to talk to each one of his customers, he really takes pride in his products, I had their almost everything except for the pasta dinners, the sandwiches are huge & filling, the bread is made with the same dough as the pies thick/crunchy, the meatballs sandwich are great you can see/taste the fresh herbs, not sure what combo of ground meat it is I can't rave enough about it you'll have to taste for yourself the freshness."}
{"text":"Ok, so I was born and raised in NY, after all my 32 years of life, I moved to Cleveland  last year. Although i dig Cleveland, I MISS PIZZA! It's at the point where we buy Digornio over getting a pie from any of those chain joints that are oh so abundant here. 
Then, we found capris! What a saving grace this place was... It is great. Definitely the closest to NY style anywhere in CLE. It is the normal size, thin crust, and made well. The owner is super cool, and the prices are comparable to a great pizza joint at home. 
I do wish they made subs and the such. But either way, I love it here!"}
{"text":"In the area from Pittsburgh, asked the hotel clerk for a recommendation. He told me about all the big chains - I'm not a big chain guy , I like to discover amazing small places. I found this place, Capri Pizza. This place is AMAZING! You can definitely notice all the fresh ingredients..and the pizza sauce..delicious..you con actually see small chunks of tasty tomato. Also, I forgot to grab a receipt, called in a couple hours later and the person who I spoke with went about be and beyond to provide me with one. Excellent service..excellent food ..pleasant environment...clean and easy to get to. I give this place 10 stars.
Nicely done Capri!"}
{"text":"While Cleveland does a lot of things really well, NY style pizza isn't one of them. So, imagine how excited this 8 year resident of NY was to read about a local pizza place so good that it \"Would give anyplace in Manhattan a run for their money.\"  

I'd really like to know how long that reviewer lived in NY to feel confident enough to state that. I'm guessing--and I very well could be wrong--that he's never lived there. A visit here and there, sure, but anyone who lived there and thinks Capri is as good as NY pizza is, frankly, in need of taste-bud replacement. 

Now, let's be clear, I LIKED Capri. I thought it was a very solid NY style pizza, but as good as real NY pizza? Get serious, please. Not even remotely close. And to be sure my first visit wasn't a fluke I went back again a week later and it was exactly the same, i.e. certainly good, but certainly nothing like authentic NY pizza. But, if I'm in the MH area and in the mood for a decent impersonation, I would absolutely visit Capri again.

Perhaps the reviewer who felt this was the best thin crust in Cleveland will let us know what the other places were. I'd love to try some of them."}
{"text":"Great classic cheese and pepperoni pizza. I had a pepperoni and sausage and it tastes totally New York style. Ambiance not to clean but tasty pizza."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of Capri Pizza since they were in Great Northern Mall years ago! Big, thin slices of delicious oven-fired pizza and a perfect tomato-y sauce that was just enough sweet. 

We also really love their pepperoni rolls- big and small.

I am never dissatisfied with the food at Capri, but I do wish it was not as expensive. We usually save Capri for a treat or just a quick slice because it's a little pricey to feed the whole family.

But then again... how do you put a price on total deliciousness?"}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Capri in the happy years of my life, as a youngster at Great Northern Mall. When they had that creepy office with the glass window on the second floor at the present location of the Sears sign on the east end of the mall. For some reason, the voyeuristic nature of that weird office creeped me the hell out. Still creeps me out. Capri was the quintessential 80's mall-pizza shop. A lot of this flashback is reminding me of that cool arcade there. And how much Fast Times at Ridgemont High reminds me of all this nostalgia. Capri now has a place out on Bagley. It is ok pizza. Brings back sweet memories. And the $8 pizza on Tuesdays is a great deal. One can easily make that $8 stretch to 4 meals."}
{"text":"The best pizza hands down!!! I don't eat pizza much because of how much bread makes up pizza, but when I have a craving it is definitely here. lived in Virginia for a few years and when I came back I had pizza from here for my birthday just because I missed it sooooo much!!!! I have getting pizza from here since 2004!!!! I describe it as teenage mutant Ninja turtle pizza because it is sooooo BIG and New York style with amazing homemade sauce!!! Lol!!!!"}
{"text":"I love New York style pie. They have combos so you can get 2 slices of cheese and a drink for $5. I got 2 slices of pepperoni and a drink for $7. I watched a guy in the back hand toss some dough and make a cheese as I ate the pepperoni. It definitely fit the bill. Not the best I've ever had, but it was real good. I'd go here again."}
{"text":"I don't know why I haven't ordered from here as it is so close to my neighborhood.  I saw the the great reviews on Yelp so we ordered a X-Large 18\" aka HUGE pizza and it was LOADED with toppings.  Well worth the cost for the quality and quantity of toppings.  They serve New York style pizza which must translate to huge slices served here.
Capri Pizza has now earned a spot into our top 3 favorite pizza list. Thanks fellow Yelper's for letting me know about this great place."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Cleveland! It is consistently good all the time...never greasy and they use fresh mozzarella. Legitimate NY style pizza. The employees are so welcoming and awesome too! I can't tell enough people how great this place is!"}
