{"text":"Gino Bros. used to be my go to pizza place, however I have not been happy with their service and have not been satisfied with their food recently. I will not be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"My family and I were looking for a place to eat after visiting the zoo and found Gino's by accident; it was a very pleasant surprise. The service was slow but very friendly, and it was completely worth the wait. The cheese lover's pizza was steaming hot and delicious with soft, fluffy crust. The cheese fries took the longest to come out, but it was understandable as they were fresh cut and firm without being goopy or burned. My family also ordered different hoagies and buffalo fries and loved them. If we're in town again, we are definitely stopping at Gino's."}
{"text":"My family has tried every pizzeria in the area.  Gino Bros Special is the best pizza in the area.  It is consistently excellent, crust just the right thickness, and cooked through to the middle.  The toppings are fresh and generous on this pie.  I don't care for meat on my pie, but the amount placed on this pizza is not overpowering.  There is a slice of heaven found in Sharpsburg!  If you don't live close by, the drive is worth it!  Within the past year, they have re-decorated the dining room, and it is much more welcoming.  Their homemade soups are excellent also, and desserts are out of this world!"}
{"text":"I have been ordering from Gino's for years and it is consistently awesome. Not a bad item on the menu and the pizza is always just right. They also throw in ranch which is a clutch move. The delivery service is always speedy too."}
{"text":"Our neighbor go-to pizza delivery. The pizza is great and delivery is fast. I recommend the ranchero pizza!"}
{"text":"Gino's quality is very suspect at times.  From proportionality of meat to undercooked wings and pizza that tastes like cardboard.   I do not believe their dough to be fresh as it tastes like frozen.  I was excited when they first opened but the food has not impressed."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and randomly picked Gino's.  The 4 cheese pizza was the best pizza I've had.....maybe ever.  Their fries are home made.  Great food.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Gino's several times, mostly because it is close to my work (as this area is not known for a vast selection of eateries), they deliver, and I never pay.  See we collectively order from here (the Office) whenever there is some type of special event, IE corporate peeps in town, special meetings, or things like the never ending bi-annual inventory when the boss will buy lunch and demand you get enough to cover dinner...yikes  Anyhow, Gino's is ok.  Pretty basic fare.  They have your typical subs, pizza, fried apps, wings, some pasta dishes and salads.  I have tried several of their pizzas, specialty and the regular ones.  I have also tried their salads and once got a gyro.  The gyro sucked, straight up sucked.  It was more or less a few pieces of mystery meat in a pita.  Small for the price and the pita was hard.  The salad (only have had the tossed) was very basic.  Iceberg lettuce, some slices of red onion, a cucumber piece and a pepperoncini.  The tomatoes they use are awful, they have never been in season, I throw them away.  But the best part is their Italian dressing.  It is some of the best I have had, and it is (I am told) homemade.  Really, really good.  I would buy bottles of it.  Pizza, eh hit and miss.  The buffalo chicken is a favorite at the office.  Spicy but not too much.  I have had the veggie, meat lover, BBQ Chicken, and other toppings.  Again it's ok, not much to say either way.  Overall not a bad stop especially in this little burg and even more so when you don't have to open your wallet..."}
{"text":"My parents order from here all the time.  I try not to eat a lot of pizza but I cannot resist when I'm around a box of Gino's pepperoni, mushroom, onion goodness with the perfectly chewy crust.  And their ranch.  I could drink it with a straw.  Stopped here on my own this week on my way home and grabbed a steak salad to go.  Really good portion and ingredients.  Really good ranch.  They have homemade soups which looked really good and desserts as well.  Ive had their desserts before.... theyre great.   Have I mentioned their ranch is seriously really good?"}
{"text":"Gino Brothers has the best ranch. I mean the pizza is great too, but the reason I always pick them over anyone else is the ranch, which is house made and comes with every pizza. While the ranch is a big selling point for me: their pizza is perfect. It's always a big hit at parties. Delivery is always fast.  They are also lovely people. They're allowing us to host our daughter's birthday party in their new (and very nice) restaurant! They said we could even decorate if we wanted to - we don't, but it was very kind of them to offer. As a business they are great community members!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a go to pizza place and I think I may have found it in Gino's. Had the Hawaiian pizza. It's was delicious. Plus the drivers have credit card machines which makes for easy payment when you don't have cash."}
{"text":"The best pizzas in the neighborhood! Fast and delicious. Prefer thin crust and eat-in if possible, better when consumed fresh out of oven. They have parking in front and back. They sometimes design out conceptual pizzas that definitely worth trying. I heard they will be moving to a new place in same neighborhood so I'll be following where they go."}
{"text":"Gino Brothers is our go-to for pizza and the only place we order from! We've ordered it numerous times for years now and it's always been delicious and our favorite pizza in the area. The ranch is game changing! The salads and subs are amazing as well, especially the eggplant parm sub. Their new location looks great!"}
{"text":"This is very good pizza. I ordered an XL with half cheese and pepperoni and half with sausage peppers and onions. The crust is not too thin, not too thick. The pepperoni is the smaller pepperonis and it's a little crispy and delicious. Overall this is very good pizza."}
{"text":"good pizza... rude service.... especially when trying to pay by credit card over the phone.. will not be back until I hear that service improves!!"}
{"text":"Gino's is a good neighborhood pizza place. They have good lunch specials that make this a regular spot every week. They have one TV, which is nice for catching up on some sports while at lunch. I've tired their Mediterranean salad, lasagna, and pizza, but the pepperoni rolls are my favorite!  We've also had these guys cater for lunches as work. The salad trays are large, and pizza's are hot. Whether you are catering an event, stopping in for a meal, or getting something for home, I recommend giving these guys a try."}
