{"text":"Good for a fast lunch if you need to make that 1:00pm meeting at the Office.

Our group of 4 were crunched for time during the lunch rush, realizing if we went anywhere on Dundas, it would take over an hour.

Entered Pesto Cafe & Bar. There's a sandwich and salad station ($5-$7), along with a cook-to-order pasta bar ($7). 

The bread for the sandwiches was a bit stale. My co-worker had the fresh pasta and the portion was quite large. Service was very quick.

The restaurant has a cafeteria style and the line got pretty long around 12:30pm.

My co-worker tried to enter the men's restroom and mentioned it was quite unsanitary, opting to wait until later. 

Nothing extraordinary stands out about Pesto Cafe Bar, but if you want fresh pasta, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Many people overlook this place. It's quite a hidden gem. I would consider this place a fast food Italian restaurant. They create the pasta right in front of you - FRESH. Great place to have a quick lunch in the hospital area."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, it looks like Pesto has been pounded out of existence. The shop's been closed since the new year. Rumour has it a Starbucks is soon to follow. One can only dream..."}
{"text":"I can honestly say I have been ROYALY disappointed every time I go here for lunch...or breakfast for that matter.  Let's start with breakfast, apparently Dijon and honey mustard \"are the same\"...ahhh nooo they are not. I didn't even realize they decided on this 'fact\" until I bit into my sandwich which ended up in the garbage.  Now onto lunch, the sandwiches (veal) are soggy and gross; their fries are tasteless and today was the icing on top of the cake where I got a Greek salad.  They asked me if I wanted olives..well yea I do it's a Greek salad but thanks for asking. Then they start pouring balsamic dressing on the salad..BALSAMIC!!  so I ask \"what is that?\" and I the reply I get is \"this is popular, you can try it\".  No, I really don't want to try it.  I didn't ask for a garden salad, i asked for a Greek salad. I then learned they don't even carry Greek dressing. Not too many things in life upset me this much but messing with my food does. Mark my words; this is the last time I will step into Pesto Cafe. If you want strange flavors with your food (not in a good way) please feel free to join the Pesto experiment."}
