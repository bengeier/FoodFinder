{"text":"Amazing drinks specials and tasty Mexican - pretty much all ya need!  Relatively cheap prices too."}
{"text":"My family loves El Camp.  We've been coming there for years, and we feel that it's a 4 out of 5 stars. Service is usually fast, friendly, and maybe it's because we've come so often, but we really feel as though we know the people that run El Campesino like they are friends, and that means a lot today.   Sure, there's an occasional slip up, but by and large, for the price, we haven't found anything we like as well or better."}
{"text":"Excellent food and a very nice atmosphere. I was pleasantly surprised at how clean and nicely finished the place was. It doesn't have the wild, hand painted walls you see in many places like this. As a result, it is a clean and respectable establishment. It is a truly nice restaurant. Margaritas are very strong and service was fast as with most Mexican places. Other places in the area are not worth the time. Guacamole's and Salsita's can't hold a candle to El Campesino. The waiter was not very friendly (possibly due to language barrier) but he was prompt and attentive."}
{"text":"I was staying at a hotel down the street from El Campesino, so I called in a take-out order after checking out the menu online.  I had the chicken soup, which consisted of white meat chicken (in chicken broth, of course), rice, pico de gallo and bits of jalepeno pepper and some cilantro.  It was fabulous and filling and had just the right amount of heat for my taste.  I also ordered some soft shell chicken tacos which come with cheese and lettuce.  They  gave me chips and salsa, so I added the salsa to the tacos.  I enjoyed these very much as well and I ended up VERY full!  My take-out order was error-free and they added in plastic tableware which I needed.  My order was done on time, so if and when I'm in the area again, I'll definitely come back.  They had a good crowd there for a cold Friday night, so they must have some happy regulars."}
{"text":"We stopped in to skip the traffic after an airport run.  I felt bad telling my family that this was probably the worst food I'd ever been served in a restaurant.  I didn't want to be critical as an out of town guest. But they all agreed that it wasn't too good.  I ordered a combo of beef taco, beef burrito and cheese relleno.  The beef was unseasoned and flavorless.  Remarkable really because Mexican style seasoned beef is so easy to make: add onion, garlic, Cayenne and you're basically there.  I ate both the taco and burrito but I forced them down. I had a 2nd bite of the relleno and confirmed that it was so bad that I would not eat it.  I don't even know how that is possible.  The red sauce on mom's enchiladas was not good either.  She barely ate her plate.  Different versions of the same tasteless beef.  The fresh chips and salsa we're good.  The queso appetizer was okay but they apparently topped it with pan scrapings from the carnitas pan?  Greasy and not very creative.    Dad's shrimp dish was the best tasting but here's the thing...ten minutes from the restaurant he had a bathroom emergency.  Literally pulled over, grabbed a roll of T.P. and ran for the bushes on the roadside.  A 74 year old man in the bushes blowing up!  (Photo of the bushes, see the orange shirt) Another 10 min and mom needed to stop at the eat-n-park to do the same.   Sorry to have to write this review, but people need to know and more importantly, the restaurant owner needs to know.  Basic family style Mexican is easy food to make but El Campisino is not pulling it off."}
{"text":"Service review:  My experience at this restaurant was horrible. First we walked in and had to meet the hostess in a very awkward area. The hostess station is im the middle of the restaurant. We were bumped into, etc. very awkward placement! Next we were seated and given cold chips to snack on. When I asked the waiter if there were warm chips he walked away. He came back about 5 minutes later and threw some chips on the table, didn't say anything, and quickly rushed to ask another table if they needed anything. We waited another 5 minutes for him to take our drink order. We then waited another 10 minutes after receiving our drinks   To have out food order taken. It took 28 minutes to receive our food!! The waiter forgot my sour cream and got my sons order completely wrong. My son say hungry for 10 more minutes while they remade his order. By the time they brought his order we were done with our food!! Then we had to chase the waiter down for refills and the check. When I went to pay the cashier asked me of everything was ok and I told her about the horrible experience. She said she was sorry (without looking up or giving any eye contact).   Food review:  the steak on my taco was sub par/ grade d. The rice was good.  Overall I will never return here. There must be a balance somewhere. If your good is mediocre, make it up with your service!!! Sheesh!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant I have found anywhere to eat the taquitos I love so much. Service is always perfect food is always perfect, short wait for food, everything is fresh what more can I say. I love it!!!"}
{"text":"Three mother f***** words:  Fried Chicken Burrito.  That dish is the sh**.  No joke. Man the food is good, the prices are cheap, plus unlimited chips and salsa!  How the f*** can you go wrong with that?  F*** Taco Bell.  I'm running to this border."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place! Great service and better food. The cheese dip is amazing! The place is large and I've never had to wait."}
{"text":"El Campesino consistently has the best Mexican food experience in the Pittsburgh area. Authentic menu and atmosphere, and quality service win every time."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in the area, and at a good price.   Highly recommended!  I am particularly fond of the lunch fajitas!"}
{"text":"While I may or may not be known to be somewhat critical of Pittsburgh metropolitan restaurants claiming to be authentic Mexican when they actually aren't I stand by the fact my reviews are all spot on.  I LIKE El Campesino and feel the quality of their dishes is BETTER than that of Casa Nayarit, Cocina Mendoza, El Paso,  Old Mexico, Cozumel, Steel Cactus, and many others. Hence, they receive a third star.  Having written that, El Campesino in Canonsburg is what I classify as a higher quality, lesser Americanized (yet still Americanized) typical, local Pittsburgh Mexican restaurant which caters to the Southwest PA palate.  I have been to El Campesino about 10 times and am confident in writing that they too have mild salsa de mesa (though it is definitely fresh and has a wonderful consistency), mild salsa verde, a \"pot roast\" type of beef which I think masquerades as their barbacoa tacos, typical bagged warm tortilla chips and over cheesed, under sauced staple foods.  Now, even though that sounds bad I must say that I thought their refried beans were fresh and more authentic than most other restaurants in the area though their rice is typical reddish, over buttered rice nicknamed \"Mexican rice.\"  I cannot understand why Bea and Milagro are the only places that offer good tasting frijoles from the pot instead of refried beans.    Their poblano pepper was very good and they had freshly made, properly cooked enchiladas de pollo.  They made a fine quesadilla and a very tasty chile relleno.  I also observed corn tortillas instead of that faux corn some places use or, even worse, flour tortillas.  All in all, when you order one of their authentic Mexican dishes they get it more right than wrong, truly they do. Their menu is compromised though, as is typical in this area, and many people are ordering tacos with cheese and lettuce, el burrito durango or burrito jefe or whatever they call their Texas creations which is absolutely understandable as one MUST cater to the clientele and make mucho dinero rather than barely fiscally make it.  I totally get it and think, all in all, El Campesino is pretty good.  I'd go their for lunch or dinner if I were asked without thinking twice.  All in all I found their food to be of better quality and less Americanized (and higher priced) than the other places I've already mentioned.  For that reason, they get a third star.  Recommendation?  If I wanted Americanized Mexican locally I'd go here over the others but I much prefer El Milagro, Bea Taco Town, La Palapa, or Las Palmas Ristorante if I actually want REAL mexican food."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the Jonnet Plaza of Monroeville lies a Mexican gem.  Yes Virginia, there is good Mexican food around Pittsburgh.  It memory serves me correctly, it is next to the Office Max and a beauty supply store.  It is a small, non-descript place but don't let that scare you away.  The food is delicious and the prices are affordable.  The chips are crispy and tasty while the salsa is fresh and can have a nice kick to it.  I really only ate the chimichangas which were flavorful albeit the chicken could be a little dry sometimes.  They are gently fried, retaining a softness to the tortilla but still have that fried taste without an overwhelming flavor or oil.  Their cheese dip is my favorite thing and it is a must order (soooooo yummy, even though I pay dearly for it later...)."}
{"text":"I stopped going to this restaurant because the food and service had gone downhill.  Recently, I stopped in after hearing the former manager/owner, Juan, had returned and there were new menu items.  I couldn't believe the difference. The new street tacos, fajita burrito and handmade margaritas were awesome! The service was perfect and the friendly and welcoming atmosphere has returned.  I can't wait for the patio open.  Welcome back Juan!"}
{"text":"very bad service had to wait to be seated for about 5 minutes server in. the bathroom didn't wash her hands no good service at all"}
{"text":"Had to update in response to someone comparing this place to Mad Mex.. This is the most absurd thing I have ever seen on yelp. That's like comparing McDonalds to Burgatory.  I worked at M.M. and frankly I don't like the corporate/upper management and would never go back there and STILL have to say that the food is on a completely different level than El Crappasino.  If someone truly thinks that place beats Mad Mex they shouldn't be writing reviews and confusing people."}
{"text":"Racist staff, not friendly.  We will not be going back to this place. It's a shame people can't put their differences aside and do their F'n job."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I can't get enough of their fajita quesadilla. My mouth is watering just at the thought!"}
{"text":"We were excited to go there,but we were disappointed.  The chps and salsa were great!  Fried shrimp came undercooked twice.  Crab enchilada was nothing like I have seen or expected.  Service was especially slow and not at a busy hour.  We won't be going back. Fish tacos would be your best choice."}
{"text":"So sad how hard it is to find decent ethnic restaurants in NE Ohio--another shining example of how Taco Bell with table service is presented as \"authentic\" Mexican food. It's like saying \"authentic\" American--what exactly does that mean?"}
{"text":"Best mexican restaurant in the area.  The food and service is consistently good.  There is also a nice patio available with lots of shade in the summertime."}
{"text":"I met my best friend, Tishy, here yesterday for frozen margaritas and as we had heard that they were pretty good. We arrived before 7pm so it wasn't too crowded and we were immediately sat. The ambience was nice enough and the place was clean. It took 8 minutes to give our drink order. It took another 14 minutes for us to actually receive our drinks, which weren't frozen-however but it showed on the check that they were, which frozen margaritas costs extra $, at $8 for one margarita. Our server did not take our order when he dropped off the drinks but he did bring up chips and salsa, which incidentally is only free for the first basket-if you want more chips you are to be charged according to their menu.  When the stressed-looking server finally came back to get out order, it was already 7:35. Being as it was getting late and I wanted to be home by 8:45 to get my kids ready for bed, we just ordered one chicken quesadilla to share as that seemed like it would be quick & yummy. We were both very disappointed with the quesadilla was rather bland, with only chicken and some cheese on it, no onions or peppers, so don't assume they will be on there.  There was some rice & lettuce on the side, too, with a slice of tomato on the bed of lettuce. I only ate a few bites as it seemed like it was served only half-made, if that makes any sense. Unlike the margaritas and quesadilla, the guacamole was quite good.  Even though there was a discrepancy on the bill in that we were charged extra for something we did not receive, we let it go as by the time we got our bill, it was after 8:30 and we just wanted to get out of there and go home.  We will most likely not be going back there again as the only thing that \"excited\" us was the guacamole, which I could make myself as it's quite easy with just a few ingredients and a ripe avocado."}
{"text":"Large menu. We all have different meals and even the kids liked their meals. I personally like it spicier, but that's why they have hot sauce."}
{"text":"Loyal customer for years! The frozen margaritas and cheese dip are a must. The service is wonderful and welcoming to all. Prices are very reasonable and the food never disappoints. I always look forward to my next \"el camps\" dining experience."}
{"text":"My mom brought me to El Campesino for lunch one (very cold) day while I was in town, and I really enjoyed it.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and bright and clean.  The food is great and they offer a lot of it for a reasonable price.  The best part?  All the vegetarian options!  I love Mexican food and eat it on a weekly basis.  My mother, however, hasn't had it as much.  I had to explain to her the differences between a burrito, enchilada, etc. since the menu didn't specify.  If you are new to Mexican food too, I would suggest asking your server to explain the menu to you or being adventurous and ordering off the cuff.  The servers are very friendly so I wouldn't worry too much about it.  We started off with complimentary chips and salsa- the chips are fresh and the salsa is yumtastic.  I, of course, ate way too many of them.  Mom ordered the Chicken Suizas Enchiladas and I got the Vegetarian Combo E- a quesadilla, bean burrito, and cheese enchilada.  I also ordered a side of rice.  I was a good vegetarian and called ahead to make sure the beans weren't cooked with pork (usually pinto beans are); they told me that they were not cooked with any meat and were ok for vegetarians.  I was not a good vegetarian, however, and forgot to ask if any of the sauces used chicken broth.  I think it would be ok since they are labeled \"vegetarian combos,\" but you might want to double-check if you are a veg like me.  The quesadilla was a little plain, but  I dunked it in salsa which helped.  Both the enchilada and burrito were covered in red sauce and were very good, the burrito being my favorite of the two.  The rice was also good- not the best ever, but perfect for being the break I needed from all the beans and cheese.  Mom really liked her lunch too.    Service was a little slow, but that was fine because we weren't in a rush to be anywhere.  Definitely a spot-on Mexican joint I would recommend to anyone that wants to stay away from all the chains that seem to surround the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place as so much of the Mexican food in Pittsburgh is a HUGE disappointment. But I have to say that El Campesino is the only Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh that I will go to at all now. The food is good, the prices are completely reasonable, the menu is expansive, and the waitstaff is great. I know that they have a few locations around the city and I would happily go to any of them as I believe it is family owned. Love it, don't be hesitant to try it."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was excellent. The servers have a new drink on the table before you finish the one you have. Nice quiet atmosphere. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys authentic Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"Always consistent. Great food. I highly recommend the fajita quesadilla.  It is overflowing with grilled chicken, pepers and onions.  You will not be disappointed!  My husband really liked the Enchiladas Mexicanas.  Noticed that the guacamole could use a bit more flavor but other than that our entrees and chips/salsa were great."}
{"text":"Wow, I was thoroughly unimpressed with El Campesino. I'm honestly surprised that Mexican food could be so bland.   Our visit started with my husband and I waiting for about five minutes for someone to come to the hostess stand to seat us. We were the only people waiting & there were about 15 tables open.   Once we were seated our waitress was quick to come over & take our drink order. She was back in a flash and expected us to be ready to order, but we were not. When she came back to take our dinner order we also ordered a half order of queso to go with our tortilla chips.  After about ten minutes our dinners came out. I was impressed but how quick they were to bring out our dinners. My dinner was so bland and I was so disappointed. I had to salt my enchilada & tostada for any flavor. I kept adding salsa to my food to add some spice. I ate half my dinner and called it quits because it was so blah. I kept hoping our queso would come out l, so I could possibly add some flavor to my meal. It never came out. When we asked about it when we got our check our waitress said oh yeah, it's sitting in the microwave do you still want it to go? The waitress seemed taken aback that we wanted it removed from our check. Seriously? We never got it!?!?! Why would we pay for it??? Why would I want cheese that's microwaved?   Save yourself from a bland, boring meal and go to Emiliano's, Patron's, Chipotle, Moe's, Qdoba or heck even Taco Bell."}
{"text":"On the road staying across the street at the Courtyard. Recommended on Yelp, so checked it out. Food was hot and well prepared, served quickly. Had the #24 combo. Delicious. Chips and salsa were top notch. Sure enough, as per one of the previous reviews, a booth across the way filled with obnoxious screaming mall brats and their ignorant parents. Made for good entertainment, glad they left. Otherwise recommended and will return as opportunity presents itself."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, than relocated to Arizona than to LA... Strange thing was I was expecting to find all this great Mexican food on the west coast, when In actuality I found myself missing El Campisino's! It's true Folks... The closer you get to Mexico, it doesn't get any better!!! I found out that so many places are about the \"Hustle\" and not about the quality. In Pittsburgh, this is as close as your going to get to authentic without travelling across the border yourself. Mind you all Mexican food in America is Americanized ~ But here you will get the most original elements available. Particular things I would like to note are the combination fajitas (Bien Cosidas) which means \"cooked well done\"~ it's big enough for two people, and the Tamatio Salsa (no tomato)~great on steak/meat (ask for it). They also cook the tortilla chips at the beginning of everyday unlike other places that get them precooked in bags. Eat up, and take my word for it ~ don't take it for granted, great mexican food is hard to find... even on the west coast!"}
{"text":"The food is fast-food unauthentic Mexican.  Sometimes you can sit down and order and then receive your food in 5 minutes.  The food is usually sloppy and not too tasteful.  The staff is somewhat friendly at times.  Not the best choice if you are looking for Mexican flavors or even atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nothing better! Hands down incredible food--every dish. My favs: fajitas campensinos, flautas, and their traditional tacos! Service is great. Edgar is fabulous! We always request him. I could eat here every day, lunch and dinner, and never get sick of it. Go Eat Here!!"}
{"text":"We visited from out of state and found this place by chance. All the food was tastey, the house-made guacamole was super fresh with some chunks of avocado, just the way I like it. One combo, along with chips and salsa, fed two of us plenty. They made my margarita frozen instead of rocks, but that's not a mistake that worried me, and it's easily fixed. Reminds me of our favorite Mexican back home."}
{"text":"I was seated prior to my boyfriend meeting me for a quick lunch date and our server  (who ended up being the same man who seated me) didn't greet us until long after my boyfriend got there, which was about 10 minutes after I was seated. As a server, myself, if someone comes in before the rest of their party, I at least ask the guest if they'd like a beverage while they wait. I ordered enchiladas and my boyfriend ordered the taco bowl. Enchilada sauce tasted like weak spaghetti sauce, and the taco bowl was mostly refried beans and didn't have any cheese. Service was super slow throughout, and the restaurant wasn't remotely busy. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Great !!  Great food, great drinks, great service, the manager came to check our table like 3 or 4 times and no we were not the only customers, they were kinda busy,  but I saw him check on all tables, great atmosphere,  great music, I don't even know what they are saying but make you dance in your seat.. I just love this place I'm coming here to watch my steelers games when I can, they have appetizers half off during the game"}
{"text":"I'm from South Texas and know what good mexican cooking is, and this is the best in town!  I have been waiting for a restaurant that knows what kinds of spices to put in the right foods.  I highly reccommend this restaurant for anyone looking to enjoy a wonderful meal that won't break your bank.  As soon as you sit down you get chips and salsa for \"free\" unlike most reastaurants that you have to pay for.  Also, if you go to their website www.elcampesino.com you can print a coupon for your meal."}
{"text":"I used to  love el camp, (I gave them 5 stars )but now they are  horrible, they dont let you customize your order like they used too, way to go corporate :("}
{"text":"A family favorite for us! Plus 32 oz. beers for 5.95? Bring on the hot sauce!!!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I've eaten here many times. At least once a week. The food is standard Mexican food. Dine in. Don't order to go. We ordered Togo once and was very disappointed. The food we took home was dried and very salty.  . We live 5 min away. Couldn't be the time. I recommend dinning in. That staff is nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Overall I feel this is an above average Mexican restaurant.  My go to dish is the chicken tacos, made with grilled chicken not the bland shredded chicken served at most restaurants.  Order with a side of the shredded cheese to add to the onion, cilantro, and lime and it proves that simple can be delicious.  I recommend you give this place a try and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Efficient friendly service with clean appealing atmosphere. Really enjoyed the shrimp tacos!  Steak is usually over marinated therefore cooked too dry for my taste. Chips and salsa are complimentary including refills. A nearby competitor charges for refill- why???  Been going there for years and they expanded their space. Yes they are doing things right!"}
{"text":"Good service ,very clean and the food is average.Been here approx 5 times. Skirt steak is always over cooked so I tried the beef burrito meal which was good. The chips n salsa were also good"}
{"text":"Firstly, this place was quite large and looked empty, but there were quite a few people there just spread out.  Between my husband and I we split the mole enchiladas, and it was enough food- 2 for him and I had one, plus the rice and salad. The also give complimentary salsa and chips which mad mex does not.  The salsa was too bland for my taste but there were hot sauces on the table so we added that and it was perfect.  The large beer was only about 4 dollars and it was pretty big.  Good food, nice place, quick service, the only thing some background music playing would have been festive."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend on a friends suggestion.  We figured it would be similar to Tex-Mex places around the area.  Fairly cheap nothing amazing but good overall.  We were wrong.  The waitstaff was attentive and nice, and  were quick with refills.  The food was really subpar though, the highlight being the free chips and watery salsa.  I got a burrito and frankly chipotle, qdoba and even taco bell would have been better options.  It was just so bland and underwhelming, i couldn't understand how tex-mex could lack so much flavor. My companion was also underwhelmed and she ended up not even taking her leftovers home  Will not be returning, fix the menu if u want to stay in business"}
{"text":"Terrible..the first sign was the waiter seemed put out when we asked for napkins because the tasteless chips were greasy. Lots of dish choices. The food was served piping hot but it didn't make up for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"We have been going to El Camp for years-but recently have decreased our patronage because of the ever rising prices. The food is always great,service is fast, everything is pleasant bit with prices rising it makes us more hesitant to eat there."}
{"text":"The staff barely spoke to me even though the restaurant was nearly empty.  The food isn't spectacular neither nasty.  Bottom line I'm not impressed."}
{"text":"Two words: clean, yummy. I will come here again. Worth the drive fron Cranberry Township."}
{"text":"I have been coming to el campesino since it opened, and it is still my favorite Mexican restaurant. I realize this isn't the most authentic or unique Mexican cuisine, but everything I have ever ordered has been delicious. The staff has always been very friendly and quick. I always look forward to an el campesino combination platter when I return home to Twinsburg."}
{"text":"The food is always good, and at a reasonable price.  The staff is great, always refilling our drinks right away.  I've been here numerous times, its always busy but I've never had to wait for a table.  I like the food alot better than the other Mexican places in Monroeville.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for good food that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"We went to El Campesino for Cinco de Mayo with our teenage/college children - party of seven.  We knew there would be a wait, but wasn't ready to wait over an hour since we were told 40-45 minutes.  After being seated, we were promptly brought warm nachos and salsa, but never got the bowl of non-spicy/mild salsa that was requested.  I also ordered a side of guacamole, which was nice and creamy but a little spicy for me.  At one point, the empty table next to ours was moved to expand another table somewhere in the restaurant to accommodate a larger group.  This uncovered a real mess on the carpeting where the table was - within a few feet of my seat.  I pointed this out to 3 separate people, including the manager, a busperson and our waiter, hoping someone would sweep it up.  The mess remained for the duration of the meal.  This was a real turn-off for me.  When the food was first served, only 4 people in our group received their meals.  One of them ordered fajitas and his meal was brought without the wraps until it was brought to the attention of the waiter.  The other 3 meals and the wraps were brought out at least 5 minutes later.  I had the Seafood Quesadilla's which were on the \"Specials Menu.\"  They were very good and the price was right, at $8.95.  They were served with shredded Romaine lettuce, sliced tomato and sour cream.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  The rest of our party enjoyed their meals too: 2 had tacos salads - 1 was vegetarian, a huge burrito, salad with sliced steak and 2 fajita platters.    Overall, I have to give the experience 3 stars because of the disgusting mess on the carpeting and nothing being done about it (especially after bringing it to their attention), the sloppy restroom conditions, long wait and the food not coming out together.  If it weren't for one or two of those details, I could have easily given it 4 stars because of the tasty food and value.  Our bill came to $99 plus tip for the seven of us."}
{"text":"As far as authentic Mexican food goes? This is the best place. Taco De Carne Asada? Great stuff. Some of the best around. Prices are reasonable, atmosphere is great. Fantastic."}
{"text":"It's not bad but not the best of the El Campesino restaurants."}
{"text":"Got a take out tonight a shrimp quesadilla and guacamole dip both were great!! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Really fast service cheap good big ass delicious margaritas bartender was not shy when it came to mixing up some off the menu shit mixology at its finest"}
{"text":"This is a complicated review.  The food is good. I don't think I've ever had anything that was not good.   The chips are usually fresh and warm.  The issue is the staff. First, never go there if there is a major sports game on (which goes for many Pittsburgh places) but you just don't want to try it.  Second, you would have to pull up a John Hughes film to find a better example of \"I can't believe I have to put up with you.\"  Its as if they are put off to take your order.   Also, over a four month period our workplace called in to-go orders.  Nine times we ordered and nine times our order was wrong.  It was either shorted an entree or had the wrong entrees.  When I called and asked to speak to a manager I was either told a) there is no manager here today or b) you have to verify all take out orders before you leave the store.  Call any other restaurant and give them 8 entrees a week, and see if they give you that line.   For a while, they were the only place, but now that Rey Azteca, Patron, and even the North Texas Fare of Don Pablos are within 3 miles, I can't see any reason to put up with this nonsense.  Finally, this wasn't one time, it was over 80% of the times I've been there, and I'm sure it was close to 40 times in a ten year period.  Again, food is good.  Wait staff are a completely different matter."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  Good food. Best poblano pepper in town.  Big 23 ounce dos x drafts for $3.50. How can you beat that price.  This is a local family owned chain with 4 restaurants.    Menu is large and very reasonable.  Belly band busting dinners for 9.50 to 11.00. I love the chips. Crisp and made here.  Order the hot salsa with the chips always.complimentary!  Owners and staff very welcoming.  Overall the food is much better than national chains but not quite Mexico City.    Vote from me as best mexican in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"The best place in Kent area for Mexican food.  Pretty much what you would expect from a Mexican place as far as menu goes with fast serve and good food.  Your birthday will bring a sombero picture and a shot down your throat."}
{"text":"First time writing a review.... so worthy. Slowed down eating because I didn't want it to end. Sososo yummy!"}
{"text":"El Campesino has wonderful Mexican food. It is more authentic than what I'd call \"American Mexican\" or \"Tex-Mex\". But that's what makes their food so great!  Their chips and salsa are great - they must be freshly made as you order them. Everytime I come here I leave feeling stuffed. They also have a nice bar. Be sure to check them out!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh. The homemade salsa is always cold and fresh. Food has always been good after many visits here. atmosphere is friendly and always clean. Love the Enchiladas Suizas."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. The servers do not know the menu. The margaritas are very overpriced and not good at all. The beef was bland and the texture was really pastey. I definitely do not recommend the relleno.   Wish I had better things to say."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. Great waitstaff. The tortillas with my fajitas were so delicate they almost melted as I ate them. Other people in my party liked the mole sauce. Another was able to order according to some food allergies so there was enough choice for everyone. Love the decor!"}
{"text":"This is a little bit more of a tex-mex sort of place, but far closer to genuine Mexican than most so-called Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh. You'll find burritos, quesadillas, enchiladas, etc. on the menu.  Prices are extremely reasonable, so make sure to go when you're good and hungry because you'll be able to get a lot for just a few books. The Special Combination is about $10 but comes with enough food for three people. I also really like getting just a plain bean burrito. At $3.50, it's a great lunch choice.  Chips and salsa come free with your meal and are usually pretty good. The salsa is sometimes a bit inconsistent, but that's what happens when a restaurant serves freshly made salsa. I'll take fresh over consistent any day."}
{"text":"The food was okay, not terrible. Everything tasted like it was store bought... just not authentic. The service was terrible as well :/"}
{"text":"Poop on a plate!  This is the kind of place where your food is probably prepared in advance and frozen, then reheated for you to \"enjoy\" and deploy.    My plate was packed with a sloppy, soggy assortment of enchilada's, each stuffed with a bland mystery meat. I couldn't decide if I should eat them or just skip the middle man and dump em' right in the shitter.   And to think I gave this place a second chance. Never again!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent Mexican food and good service. Nothing like you would get in the southwest, but the best I have had in NE Ohio."}
{"text":"We live in Washington PA and there isn't much around here for Mexican restaurants. This is about the only place in the area to get a decent Mexican meal. The prices aren't too bad and the food is actually pretty good.   This is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service with delicious food! I don't need anything else for my authentic Mexican. Enchiladas and fajitas are best."}
{"text":"Love El Camp!  The new Wexford location is fantastic.  They have a huge outdoor patio. Everything from their chips and salsa to margaritas are great.  Recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Our go to Mexican restaurant in the south hills of Pittsburgh!  Seriously amazing food and amazing service.  I love their chicken taco salad. Free unlimited chips and salsa too!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Robinson.  The steak burrito is huge, packed with tons of steak, and the best cheese, it's a great meal.  Considering the huge portions the prices are great.  You could go to a place like MadMex and probably wouldn't find half the items on their menu that's at El Campesino, and the ones you did find would be double or more the cost.  There are definitely some food items like their fajita's that aren't as good as the ones at MadMex but the flautas, pablanos, taquitos, and many other items are fantastic.  They also have some of the best chips and salsa out.  I've seen some reviews that described it as canned sauce and oily chips, I don't know if they've since changed what they use but I think their salsa is one of the best and I've seen them make their chips fresh there. The only reason for the 4 stars is sometimes the service isn't always the greatest,  they have a tendency to speak to other workers there in Spanish (which I speak) and heard them complaining about customers.  El Campesino's is definitely worth eating at if your really hungry and craving Mexican cuisine. It's rarely packed out to the point service is terrible, and the food is made to the same consistency thar if you find something you like, you won't have to worry about it being terrible the next time you order it."}
{"text":"Disappointing. ...once was our favorite Mexican food in Pittsburgh. ...now not so much....had Caluzedos for two...70% beef, that was  ...very few shrimp...to top it off with a near empty restaurant the service was lacking...."}
{"text":"This place sucks. I ate lunch here a few days ago. I know this area isn't exactly a mecca of fine cuisine, but this restaurant was just all kinds of wrong. One of the worst places I have eaten in a long time. The waitress was high on something or half asleep, not sure which. The chips and salsa were the token Mexican restaurant staple, to be expected. The food was slop. Camarones del diablo (spicy shrimp dish), tasted like camarones de la basura (shrimp from the trash can). Tasted like canned food. It was supposed to come with guacamole, and did not. It wasn't very spicy, as described. I'd take a hot-pocket over this food any day of the week. My stomach ached for the rest of the day after this meal. Honestly, if I lived in Robinson, I'd probably return here just to give it a second chance, due to a lack of Mexican options. Hopefully this was an uncommon experience, but I'm not going to find out. Maybe the margaritas are good? Maybe dinner service is better than the lunch service?"}
{"text":"The best.  Chicken Chimichangas, Cancun Cheesesteak, and Pollo Chorizo are my top three.  Don't forget the cheese dip.  Best Mexican food in the area.  Streetsboro location is great too."}
{"text":"This place is always consistent and delivers good Mexican food. I am a regular and always enjoy the atmosphere and the food."}
{"text":"Everybody has one ... that go-to restaurant you can count on to fulfill your craving. It won't cost an arm and a leg and the service is quick and painless. The meal is pretty consistent, and you know you can rely on your favorites. For me, El Campesino (or El Cramp, as we lovingly call it) is my go-to Mexican place in Monroeville. I usually get the lunch special #2, ask for extra salsa, and then dump it all over my rice and beans. Mmmmm."}
{"text":"My husband and I went last week for the first time. It's located in a plaza so we didn't  expect much. We were both pleasantly surprised.  The menu is very large and the service was fast and very friendly and attentive. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"its ok, I've had better...people are nice,  food is mediocre"}
{"text":"Moved to San Francisco 2 years ago.  Live within walking distance to the Mission.  Still miss this place.  'Nuff said.  FYI: I was addicted to their chips/salsa and always ordered the #11 or #14 combo with a big ol' frosty Dos Equis.  Yum."}
{"text":"We've gone here more times than I could possibly count.  Never had a bad meal.  I would not say it is high-end Mexican (food does not look fancy on the plate), but Mexican comfort food--basic, down-home cooking."}
{"text":"stopped here for lunch a few months ago. complimentary chips and salsa! staff was wonderful but the food was VERY BLAND!! should've known there was only 2 other parties at the time."}
{"text":"Went there Sunday eve with six friends. As the posted reviews range rather wildly across the spectrum, I was very interested to try El Campesino myself. I'm glad I did. Starting with the chips and salsa: chips were O.K. but the salsa had a nice touch of heat and enough flavor to make the experience very enjoyable. It wasn't a lot of heat, but probably enough to turn someone off if they don't like spicy things.  Next, I split a half-pitcher of margaritas ($11.95) with a friend. I'm glad I did. The margaritas were very good and you could taste the tequila. My friend was left longing for more.  For dinner I chose three enchiladas ($7.50): one cheese, one ground beef and one shredded beef, plus rice ($2.25). One test I use for Mexican restaurants is \"What is the quality of the ground beef?\" I have found that some places go for the cheapest ground beef they can buy, but better places serve ground beef of a higher quality. Well, all three enchiladas passed my \"Darn, That's Good!\" test. Then I poured some salsa onto my rice and mixed in a little enchilada sauce. Nice. As good as any rice I've had.  Only one person in the party did not give rave reviews to what they ordered. They ordered something that was a lot hotter than what they thought it would be. They didn't say it was bad, just hot.  So overall, we gave El Campesino four stars, and I will probably put it in the rotation of my favorite Mexican Restaurants."}
{"text":"Si por favor!  I just moved here from San Diego and have been jonesing for some good mex-i-can. All I've been able to find so far is Chipotle and On the Border, which are not all that bad, but El Campesino is the traditional fare I've been craving.   I highly recommend the chiliquiles which are prepared a little differently from what I'm used to, but are still so yummy!   Muy delicioso!!"}
{"text":"Love going to this place! Friendly place with great food. Definitely recommend. I love the taco salad. Family friendly."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. Staff is super friendly and service is always top notch. We are regulars here and go at least once a month. We never really go at a certain time so we have been there during dinner rush and times where its been us and few other families.   I recommend sitting at the bar if you're alone or with another. The bartender is very pleasant and it seems to be a lot more laid back. Families won't have a problem sitting in the dining area. The longest we ever waited was 10-15 minutes.  Food is excellent. Hot fresh and many varieties and drinks are cold and fresh too. Prices are great as well."}
{"text":"I love reading reviews of others that say \"not authentic Mexican food\" and that you should go somewhere else in the city. News flash geniuses, the only place to get authentic Mexican food, is MEXICO!   This is a great American-Mexican restaurant. It's away from the city and tucked away from the traffic in Robinson. I have gone there on Saturday evenings and it's been mildly busy. Only once was it packed but the servers are all friendly.   They have a large menu which I see people complain about the servers not knowing the menu. So again geniuses, Mexican is probably the most simple food out there. The menu is not complicated, they have a lot of combos is all.   On top of it all, the food is great, and the place is CLEAN!"}
{"text":"This place is always on point and we end up going twice a week on average. Don't hesitate go eat there!"}
{"text":"Good quality food for lunch or dinner. I would rank this place very high compared to all the local mexican restaurants. A definite must try.  Service can be slow and painful."}
{"text":"I always forget about this hidden gem in Monroeville. The food is yummy and is the closest to authentic Mexican in Monroeville. (I spent 4 months studying abroad in Guadalajara, Mexico back in '98 and this food is very authentic.) The refried beans are creamy and delicious.  I ordered the steak tacos. The tacos are also authentic being that they used real steak. Three tacos are served, each wrapped in foil to keep them warm. They are served with pico de gallo, but I switched that with chopped onions & cilantro. Wish there would have been a side of guacamole or sour cream that automatically comes with them. I did ask the waitress for a side of sour cream and she brought me a small bowl of it. I will say that the service got really slow when they got busy, but we didn't mind. Our waitress was friendly as was the hostess at the front. Definitely recommend if you craving authentic Mexican. Only giving 4 stars due to slow service."}
{"text":"Decent food, tasty margaritas and great service."}
{"text":"The food and service here are amazing, the salsa is fresh and not bought in. Love the place and go there every chance I get"}
{"text":"Good restaurant.   The service here is very good.  The food arrives quickly, and is above average in flavor.  Not as spicy as other Mexican restaurants, but adequate.  The prices seem a bit above average, but not too high.     Pros: great service, above average food and decent beer selection.   Cons:  food could use a bit more spice, and perhaps a tad overpriced.     Overall, a quality, but not outstanding Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is the best Mexican food in the Pittsburgh area!  Alfredo, Nestor, Marta, and the staff are wonderful. Pollo Mexicano is really great!  The salsa and chips we crave. We have tried almost everything on the menu. I can't say enough about their food at this location. Alfredo always remembers our drink order for the 5 of us."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service every time. We love this place!  The prices and portions are good. We have never been disappointed with our meals here."}
{"text":"Food is great but service isn't consistently good here. Portions are large, prices are good, and food is quick. But I prefer the quality of the food and service at the Robinson location."}
{"text":"The food was clearly reheated and pretty bland. Pretty standard \"Mexican\" I ordered mole enchiladas and they didn't taste like much.    The waiter walked away is the middle of us ordering. So strange!"}
{"text":"Ok, setting aside I'm half mexican, have traveled to mexico throughout my life, lived there for 10 years, and am a southern california native. Trying to be objective as possible this place at best is bad. My wife and I ordered the number one plate. An enchilada, a taco, and a choice of beans or rice. That's right, you choose one or the other where anyone who knows even americanized mexican restaurants offer both in an entree. Anyway we got our food and it had no appeal on the plate. Enchiladas drowned in some bland sauce and the taco was a hard shell with only lettuce and white cheese which by the way weren't even in the taco. It was as if the tacos were tossed on the plate. But here's the kicker. I'm used to mystery meat. God knows I've had my share in places like jack in the box and taco bell, but what they call ground beef was down right creepy. Really, this isn't mexican food much less americanized mex food. The service? Bare bones minimum. Oh, and the salsa that they serve with the chips I swear has to be Pace or La Victoria. The prices in the menu do not justify this crap they're serving. One star for the beer on draft I had and one more because they played  mexico lindo y querido through the speakers. Won't be back. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Love this little gem.  I have been here for dinner several times and it has always been a good experience.  Stopped in for a quick lunch today and they blew me away.  The food as always is very good and our orders came out 5 minutes. Great spot if you need to get In and out."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and great flavor here.  The staff is attentive and knowledgeable.  I've tried several items on the menu.  My favorites are the succulent pork carnitas and the  combination tortilla dips.   The margaritas are big and bold.  I have found this to be the best Mexican cuisine in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Everyone's got their favorite combo at their favorite Mexican restaurant. Go with them and they'll lean in with a whisper: \"get the #6. and ask for it with cheese instead of beef! add onions!\" Watch their eyes glisten.  so here's what you actually want to do.. go with the special combination! swap the chile relleno out for a chile poblano! and ask for the burrito with extra sauce and own its own plate!  Then fall back into the cushions of the rickety booths and bask in the tacky decor, which keeps you from seeing most of the restaurant and the mall-shopping families that bring their 5 kids. Enjoy the crisp-if-oily chips and fresh salsa. Alternate drops of red and green hot sauce but apply sparingly.. it's hot!  The special combination arrives no more than 10 minutes after ordering--the service is on point throughout; you'll want for nothing and they don't care to be you friend. Here's how you proceed:  1) Be stunned: 3 plates (if you used the burrito-alone trick) packed with food. It's ok, you won't finish it. At $13.75, you get to taste everything worthwhile (not the tamale) from in the smaller combos and pick your favorites.  2) Go after the poblano. It will be piping hot, the beautiful fried crust still light, the pepper still juicy and bursting with well-balanced spice from the enchilada sauce, and the queso fresco still running across the plate. Best item on the menu.  3) Alternate bites of the cheese enchilada (the chicken gets dry and you'll have enough beef in the burrito) and beef taco. Both must be eaten hot but neither are as important as the poblano. The enchilada's brown sauce again works with the queso, and the rustic taco is tightly balanced.  4) At this point, you don't need to finish any of the remaining items. The burrito is where I go next but it's up to you. I like the tomato+onion sauce but not with my other items (hence it's own plate), and they usually don't add enough--the burrito will be dry. That's why you asked for extra sauce.  5) The tostada is last as it's a salad, can be eaten cold without any loss of flavor or texture, even if it's plain. The beans are decent though they need salt and the rice is occasionally dry.  keep going until you can't. that's how you do it. go do it."}
{"text":"Best salsa on planet earth...purée!  Honestly, just like every other Mexican joint with great food but we had an amazing experience with very friendly staff...highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying that I love Mexican food.  We have tried several since coming to town.  El Campesino has become our absolute favorite.  The food is fresh, the service is super friendly and the margaritas are just perfect.   It always starts with the chips and salsa at any Mexican restaurant.  Here you get very tasty salsa that is watery, not too chunky and has a nice mild taste.  The chips are fresh without being greasy.  The prices are reasonable.  The atmosphere allows for good conversation at your table with family and friends.  Enchiladas are my go to along with the queso and chips."}
{"text":"I've eaten here multiple times in the past year. Love it. Their guacamole is spot. I've ordered their grilled fish tacos and was very happy! I have also ordered their veggie quesadillas with rice, which was deliciously cheesy and yummy. I am a fan of their margaritas, especially when they have their $3 special.  The service here is also quick and pretty friendly. I like it here a lot and will continue visit."}
{"text":"Great place and location. Food is not bad but I wouldn't exactly serenade for it. I know we're a long way from the culture and cuisine but the price is way too steep and you'd understand if you've tried any Mexican food from anywhere in the Southwest region.  Campesino means 'peasant farmer' and the dishes in my opinion should be as simple and flavorful as peasants in any culture use the simplest of ingredients to create flavorful art. Most of the dishes on the menu are quite the opposite of this.  We dined here twice at the bar area and both times the service was not great, overwhelming it seems for the staff, that can't remember to look over and see how you're doing, forgetting anything you've ordered from the a la carte menu or remember the check after you've asked for it. We were left irritated at times observing the staff finding time to chat up with regular customers long enough for us to know the entire story while waiting for a refill on our drinks.  The first time there we sat at the bar because we're 'adults' and a family with three young children disrupted the bar environment and were paid more attention because they knew the owner and staff. I ordered the Chile Verde and it was way too salty the veggie fajitas were ok but we were brought flour tortillas instead of the corn tortillas requested. Waitstaff never returned so we gave up trying to get it corrected.  The second time we sat down our drinks were not filled immediately because the staff decided to chat with the new table that came in for what seemed like forever. I ordered fajitas because it came in a cast iron-skillet, usually means its going to be sizzling from their kitchen to your table, were disappointingly, not very hot at all and we're 'marinated' and kind of dry, which means they were not fresh and the onions and peppers were plated a little early. The other plate was a shrimp quesadilla which was great except that it came before the other dish, so we dined more or less separately waiting for drinks in between.  The atmosphere could also use some music, as you can hear everyone's conversations even from the main dining area. The drink ware is not frosted, so your beer gets a little warm pretty fast, especially in a 22 Oz. mug.  The likelihood of us returning is very slim as there are other choices to explore around the city."}
{"text":"Being from the great state of Texas - I do not consider that I'm eating a Mexican meal if it does come with rice and beans.  Most of their meals do not so that is very disappointing and thus I do not go out of my way to go back to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service. Got a very filling quesadilla for less than $9. Rice could have been spicier but was good."}
{"text":"Fastest service I have ever had at a restaurant!! I ate a few chips and salsa and then bam there was my food, bubbling hot. This is our go to place when we need a quick meal. We each usually get one of the vegetarian combinations which are all great. Just right portions for me, nothing too huge that I have to worry about taking home."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food every time we have been here!  I usually get the enchiladas but today I got the tacos meal with rice.  It's always consistent and one of my favorite Mexican restaurants!  I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Food was alright not the best, not the worst.  We  went on a night that wasn't busy at all and our waiter couldn't have cared less about us.  He seemed completely inconvenienced by us simply taking up one of his booths.  This is the second time in my life I haven't tipped but I truly feel he didn't earn it."}
{"text":"It's inauthentic, campy, unimaginative....but, you could do a lot worse.  This is leagues better than Don Pablo, Chi-Chi's (Hepatitis A, anyone?), Baja Fresh, Qdoba, and even Chipolte. As noted by fellow reviewers the service is a strong suit - friendly, attentive, and seemingly always in a good mood.  The lunch specials are a good deal as well.   So with the right approach - i.e. don't go buck-wild ordering the enchiladas de mole and expect Rick Bayless to magically appear on your plate  - this isn't a bad option.  Just relax with a Dos Equis, some nacho cheese over a burrito, and a couple of churros and everything will be ok."}
{"text":"If I'm going out for great Mexican- I'm eating here. My Favorite, hands down."}
{"text":"I had lunch here the other day and I have to say, my experience was truly stellar.      I'm actually not a big fan of Mexican food, but the group I was with praised this places food (and obviously they all were fans of Mexican food). So as not to be the odd man out, I looked for something I may hopefully enjoy. I ordered the chicken chimichanga and asked for no refried beans. I honestly felt bad to request this because I didn't want to insult them for changing up the way a dish was made, but they were happy to oblige. We ordered Margaritas as well (which were fantastic!) and the bartender (Maurice) was super friendly.     When my food came out I was pleased to find they had satisfied my request (no refried beans), and the food was superb! I found that I was definitely a big fan of the Chicken Chimichanga, and I look forward to ordering it again the next time we choose to eat here.      Not to mention I have been craving another one of their awesome margaritas ever since! The bartender even told us all to make sure we drank \"the wish\" which I learned was the very end of the margarita that resides in the bottom of the margarita glass. Anyways I recommend this fabulous food joint to anyone, whether you like Mexican food or not give it a shot! You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Generous portions of nicely spiced mexican food at reasonable prices.  The staff is excellent --- always fast, always friendly, always on top of their game.  Some of the great dishes include Special Combination #11, Fajita Quesadilla, the Steak Burrito...... Everything is fresh and served piping hot.  Ask for sour cream or Guac, and you get a decent sized portion of it.  None of these little plastic cups where you have to ask for 2 or 3.  The fresh chips are good, and the salsa is good, if a little runny.  I've been here over a dozen times, and I'm always satisfied with the experience."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today. Wait staff was almost absent and dismissive. Food was okay, not amazing but not great. Little pissed about my fries (yes I ordered fries) and brought rice instead. Mix up, no big deal but rolled his eyes at me and brought a pathetic amount of nasty fries much later at full cost. With the food being not really outstanding in any way I won't be back."}
{"text":"I try to give this place the benefit of the doubt. The chips and salsa are decent enough, the food is decent enough, but I swear I get the worst waitress every time I visit.  Me: Do you have any beer specials? Waitress: Huh? Me: ... I'll have a Tecate. Waitress: A what? Our beer have weird names. ... Me: I'll have the Pastor taco special. Waitress: I don't think we have that. Me: It's on the chalkboard in the lobby. Waitress: I've never heard of it so I don't think we do.  The food is fine. I've not had a bad meal here, despite the 12oz Tecates costing $5.50 which is absurd. However, this is one of many bad service experiences I've had."}
{"text":"I love El Camp! It's definitely the spot to go for Mexican food in stow! Chips and delicious salsa to munch on prior to meal... Which by the way, the food comes out so fast!  I always get the shredded chicken taco salad. My boyfriend loves the chimi changas. Spelling?  There is one man who works here who isn't very customer friendly, mostly because he's so silent, but no worries. He probably means well. The food is delicious, fair priced and fast. Great spot for a not so fancy dinner date"}
{"text":"TASTIER THAN ALOT OF PLACES I'VE TRIED IN NEW MEXICO!   Don't bother with Mad Mex. If you what some tasty cheap eats served hot and fast go here! The place serves familiar Tex Mex and also some delicious traditional fair.   Menu Fav: Fajita Quesadilla"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's especially nice in the summer on the outdoor patio. The chips, cheese dip, and fajita quesadillas are the best and the service is super fast!"}
{"text":"Good authentic Mexican food went here on Valentine's day for Dinner. We actually frequent this place as we live close. They have good food the service is always good too !  Is suggest the fish tacos it's usually my goto  They also have happy hour food and drink specials too. Overall a good place with some great eats and service. Maybe I'll see you there sometime"}
{"text":"Good Mexican spot. Very casual.   Their ground beef is delicious. Usually at Mexican places it's fatty, or spicy, or greasy... El Camp's is none of the above.   Food is also inexpensive! I realized today it's sometimes cheaper to order individual items instead of a combination platter... I got three items for $10.50 (combo platter 2) and my boyfriend got three individual tacos for $5.50 total. Lesson learned.   4 stars only because there's nothing that's ever \"wow\"-ed me about it in all my visits there."}
{"text":"Upon hearing how awful Mexican food is in Pittsburgh, a coworker suggested this place to me. Since its on the exact other side of the city than me, I usually assumed that I'd never check this place out (and that he was probably wrong to begin with).  Well, we were up on the North Side and decided to go a little further north. We checked this place out and, to be honest with you, I was happy that I was wrong. This place is pretty good, at least from what we sampled.  The food was great. The decor was pretty cool. They have a couple chairs with Frida's head on them. Our only complaint was the table they sat us at. It was about six feet from the kitchen, kinda just out in the open. Whenever the front door would open, we'd get a blast of cold air. Plus the table was wobbly. I don't want to sound like I'm finding fault, but there were like three other tables taken, they could have given us plenty of tables other than that one.  We ordered 2 lunch platters and an extra side of rice. Altogether, we got a quesadilla, a tostada, a burrito, a tamale and an enchilada. Everything was pretty tasty. My only gripe on the food was they poured enchilada sauce on the burrito. While it didn't ruin it for me, it would have been nice to say so on the menu.  Both the enchilada and burrito were made with ground beef. Again, it didn't ruin it for me, but it would be nice to know on the menu. The quesadilla and the enchilada were both stuffed with cheese. I won't lie, but the quesadilla was the best I've had in Pennsylvania, barring my own kitchen. Creamy cheese, a nice little crust on the bottom, it was perfect.  The chips and salsa were the friggan bomb. Honestly, I could have drank the salsa. And to be honest, I literally did (just so I could say I did it). Its a medium-consistancy tomato paste. It has a bite to it. A nice little bite. I personally like spicy, my girlfriend does not. I loved the salsa and she didn't really have any. I do think they should have a mild salsa....just in case people don't like hot ones.  Finally, the real show stopper. The rice. Simple. Fluffy. Orange rice. Some lima beans and corn in it. Its amazing. I ate all the rice and the chips and salsa pretty much to myself and I let her eat the items. I did go nuts on the tamale, though.  All this for $18...which is about what I'd have paid at California Taco Shop. Its not authentic, but it doesn't always need to be. The food is good, tasty and affordable. The salsa and the rice were exellent. If this place wasn't so far out of the way for me, I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Chicken taco salad is fantastic!  Friendly service always and the prices are great for what you get!  Check the lunch specials if you are there by 2:30."}
{"text":"My friends and I have gone here weekly for years with no issues.  Lately though things have really changed.  The service is less than friendly, the food is served with missing items that are listed on the menu, and they raised their prices, big time!!  My friends and I are going to go to another establishment where we feel welcome."}
{"text":"Had dinner there with my best friend this past Friday night.  There was a small line at the door but we were seated promtly. Our server was polite and attentive but not overbearing.  Our drink orders were promptly taken and served. When he did take our orders he reviewed all of the options with us and made sure our orders were exactly what we wanted.   Our food was fresh and served within a reasonable time frame.  Even when the sour cream on the side of my fajita had fallen he immediately got me another side of sour cream with no charge.   We left with very full stomachs and definitely plan to return."}
{"text":"The food is good but everything else has been slipping since they've shut down the back room. We have been coming for several years and this is the third of three final chances they have gotten from us. The service has been continually slow the last few times and this time both orders were wrong. Had this been a first time issue, we would gladly have given them another chance, but this was the third time and they are still riddled with too many problems to return. We will head to Aurora to El Camino from now on, even though we like to give our money to businesses in Twinsburg."}
{"text":"Best chicken burritos and rice. The service is fast and parking is easy to get in out of."}
{"text":"On the upside, the food is authentic and pretty cheap.  $7.95 for a chile relleno, an enchilada, and rice and beans?  Sign me up.  It's way better than Cuzamil on Murray Ave charging $14 for two chiles rellenos.  It has the typical cheesy music / futbol on TV kind of atmosphere.  The service is pretty crappy though.  Our waiter took our drink orders and told us chips & salsa would be on our table in a moment.  Five minutes later, he came by and asked \"Did I take your drink orders already?\"  Food arrived in a decent amount of time, but soda refills never did.  I agree with Juan C about the chiles rellenos being pretty lame - the pepper was thin and pretty wimpy, and the seeds looked really dried out and old.  Once we were done with our food, our waiter cleared our plates, then got into a lengthy personal discussion with another customer while we waited for the check.  Overall: decent food for the price, but if you live in the city it's not worth the drive."}
{"text":"On another cold, grey, snowy Saturday I was struck by a feeling of homesickness and the need for some good Tex-Mex.  Some local friends had brought up El Campesino so I decided to make the drive out to Monroeville and fight the horde of people going to the mall to try it out.  While others might be put off by the fact that it's located in Strip Mall next to a Big Lots, this was nothing new to me.  In fact it reminded me a lot of home where some of the best Tex-Mex restaurants are small family affairs located in random Strip Malls.    Two good signs that this was probably going to be more authentic were that TV was tuned into Univision and broadcasting a Mexican Football (soccer) match and that Tejano music was playing on the radio.  Unlike some of the other so called Tex-Mex restaurants here in Pittsburgh, El Campesino doesn't make you pay for your chips and salsa, and the salsa is actually pretty good.  It could be a little spicier for my taste, but still pretty good.  My chicken enchiladas verdes were flavorful and quite tasty.  My only complaint would be that I wished they would have put more of the verdes sauce on them instead of sour cream.  So if you are out by the monroeville mall and are looking for something tasty to eat, try out El Campesino instead of one of the many fast food joints in the area."}
{"text":"After coming home from college food and wanting to throw something special as a Mother's Day gift, we decided to go out for Mexican, and reviews said El Campesino was good. I now wonder what these people were thinking when they said such a thing. The only good thing out of this place was the free chips and salsa - but even that comes at a cost if you want a refill. My mom had a salad that might as have been a soup, since it was a liquid at the bottom and had almost no lettuce. My dad and I had tacos and enchiladas, with beef that was unseasoned, and the enchiladas might as well have come out of a damp box. The portions were small, In contrast to reviews I saw here. The service was just as bad, as our waitress, if she even spoke more English than enough to take our orders, did not ask how our meal was or offer any refund at all. The atmosphere is terrible too, since I felt like I was at a Taco Bell that served alcohol. For the future, don't trust all the reviews here. The portions are small and low on flavor, and the service is minimally helpful. Taco Bell offers way more in terms of price, portion, and service. Don't settle, enjoy your meal. Stay away from this sham."}
{"text":"Always fast, good quality, friendly servers and well priced!  Our go-to for taco salads and fajitas!  Tish review applies to both the Streetsboro and Stow locations."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this El Campesino location. We stopped in here for dinner on Saturday night since we were out shopping. We got there around 8 pm and were seated right away. The bar area seemed pretty packed, but the dining room area(where we sat) had some openings. We were greeted by our waitress right as we sat down. We ordered our drinks and another man came out with chips and salsa right after that. When our waitress came back she asked if we were ready to order. We placed an order for the queso, but told her we needed more time to look over the menu. She literally came back out with the queso a minute later and asked if we were ready to order. We still needed more time so we said so. She came back two more times very quickly and finally on her next time around, we were ready to order. My boyfriend got the fish tacos and i got the chicken fajita salad. Our food was out in less than 10 minutes and everything was very hot and fresh. Our food was very good- great flavor and portion sizes.   I gave El Camp four stars because the food was very food and our waitress gave us extra chips for free even though the menu says there would be a charge. The only reason i didn't give 5 stars is because our waitress was very pushy. I really appreciate great service, but it was to the point where i couldn't look over the menu because i kept getting interrupted to see if i was ready to order yet.   We didn't order dessert, but a table across from us did and it looked amazing. I'll have to go back to try desserts next time!"}
{"text":"If you do not get one dish, make sure it's the Chile Relleno!!! Soooo gross. Chile Poblano was delish though."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times while visiting family and have enjoyed it each time. The food is always fresh, tasty, hot, and the service is prompt and friendly.  I noticed on one of the Yelp reviews someone dissing on the chili relleno, but I've got to tell you I really like it. I've eaten chili rellenos all over the US and Mexico, and rarely are any two the same. (I had one in Mexico City a number of years ago that was a green pepper stuffed with ground meat, queso, walnuts, and cranberries - strange, but good). At El Camp the relleno is a ground beef and cheese stuffed green pepper- simple, but very tasty."}
{"text":"Very disappointed today.  Typically, I'm all for El Camp, but today was a bust.  Its Cinco de Mayo, on a Friday, got it.  Gonna be hella busy.  However, when we tried to call in a lunchtime order, there was no answer.  We tried many many times.  Then, I go in to place a to-go order, and the wait time is 30-40 minutes.  Again, Cinco de Mayo, on a Friday.  Did they not plan for this?  Especially for a crazy lunch rush.  Typically, you sit down, the person takes your order, and you have it in 5 minutes.  I'd really have to wait 30-40 minutes...?    Maybe this is all my unrequited hunger talking.  I do like the place - servers and food.  They are willing to accommodate me if I order something and \"Vegetarianize\" it.  The frozen drinks do look appealing.  I guess El Camp is gonna have to get my 3 stars today, and hope I revisit soon, when less crowded, so that I may revise my appraisal in the future."}
{"text":"El Campesino is an established restaurant with several locations in PIttsburgh. The Wexford branch is one of my favorite local places to dine and I personally believe they are arguably the best cultural cuisine in the area. Very large portions that come out very quickly. Service is dynamic, it is not uncommon to have several servers. Wonderful variety including ala carte and the best bar in Wexford with an outdoor patio that overlooks the Wexford area. I recommend the beef chimichangas and house guacamole.   I have never had a remotely bad experience here in the 15 times I have dined here and I will quickly connote poor service when experienced. Skip the clamor of Patron and stretch your legs out at El Campesino. Highly recommended for happy hour."}
{"text":"The food was really good.  We'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard Tex-Mex menu without any innovations or anything approaching real Mexican food. I went to this location a couple of times and while the service was decently fast, it was uninspired. Sitting down, we received the obligatory basket of fried chips with a salsa bowl that was basically watered-down tomato juice. The rest of the meal was almost as undistinguished with the \"normal\" burritos, tacos, etc. I saw nothing that had any kind of spirit to it and was almost completely underwhlemed by the complete lack of any green vegatables in the place. Just to be sure, I looked over several other party's offerings and they all looked the same: rice, beans, and cheese."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place in Pittsburgh -- it's the only place I've found with the white cheese dip I love so much."}
{"text":"I don't come here often enough to give it 5 stars, though maybe it is close to being worthy. First and foremost, do yourself a favor at the beginning of the meal: spend the $6 and add on the cheese for your complimentary chips/salsa. This stuff is incredible. I don't know what kind of cheese it is, but the taste is a cross between creamy and Heavenly.   Tonight, I got the enchiladas \"suizas,\" and they were good, not great. They were chicken/cheese enchiladas served with rice, lettuce, sour cream.  The chicken and minimal veggies rolled up all tasted a wee bit bland.   Anyways, I can't comment on service because I don't come here often enough, but my guy tonight was quite nice except he didn't check on me quite enough.  If you like Mexican food, you can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible. From the bland-worst-then-taco-bell food to the rude arrogant staff. They will rip you off every opportunity they get. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! Go to Chipotle, Don Pablos, Patron, Mad Mex or even Taco Bell before going to this rip off of a restaurant. Monroeville has plenty of Mexican style places that offer much much better food at much better prices."}
{"text":"Being that I have several authentic Mexican restaurants close by I feel pretty lucky. While out one night with my wife we decided to have a date night at El Campesino.  Since it was date night I started off with a Mango Margarita. It was HUGE and so refreshing. It tasted just like a fresh ripe mango. One is definitely all you need.  For our entree we went with the Grilled Cazuelada Dinner For Two which consists of beef, chicken, shrimp and chorizo, cooked with onions, tomatoes and bell peppers. Served with rice, refried beans, lettuce, tomato, sour cream, guacamole, pico de gallo and your choice of  flour or corn tortillas. It is a lot of food for the money and the perfect amount for a couple. The beef, chicken, shrimp and chorizo were all cooked to perfection! Juicy and absolutely delicious! Needless to say that we left stuffed and had plenty of leftovers for lunch and dinner the following day.  I don't get all of the bad reviews as the food is always superb and service is always excellent for us as we have been several times.   Definitely check them out if you love Mexican food and are ever in the area!"}
{"text":"Inconsistent, sometimes the food is great.  Often the same dishes are just bland, and needs tabasco or queso for some flavor.  I have been about 20 times.  It is not bad, but too often not great. :(. I hope they do better."}
{"text":"Typical run of the mill Mexican restaurant in Monroeville. Everyone in the group I was in enjoyed their meal- I got the taco salad and it tasted great. Other Mexican places I've been to have been willing to substitute the chicken in the taco salad for extra veggies or beans, however our waiter didn't allow me to do this. Further, we had a 10% coupon on my phone to use for our meal, and the waiter said they only accepted coupons printed out and in person (the coupon didn't even have a barcode)! Come on guys, it's 2014."}
{"text":"Wouldn't eat here if you payed me. Dirty. Watch what your eating. They are not clean and there are issues in the kitchen with pests. Honestly. Check there rating with the health inspector."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I went with my boyfriend this week. I am already craving it again. The waiter was amazing. I asked him the difference in the margaritas, he steered me towards the sunset. I could have kept drinking them. They are amazing, slightly on the sweet side. But that's how I like it. Next I got a combination dinner and asked for a chile relleno. He asked if I had ever had them there and then explained the relleno and the poblano and how they make them. Best choice to change to the chile poblano. My boyfriend got a burrito and quesadilla. He said they were both very good. We ordered cheese dip (queso) at the beginning. It was a little spicer than most places I have had it. There was a lot of it and it was really good. The portion sizes were huge. I took home half of my dinner. My boyfriend finished all of his, but was VERYY full. I will definitely be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"This is one of those standard \"authentic\" mexican restaurants that have popped up absolutely everywhere in the last few years.  El Campesino, El Meson, El Rincon, Mariachi Loco, Mariachi Coco...I like to think there is one giant Mexican Czar who operates them all!  Much like Chinese take-out restaurants, they all pretty much have the same menu and their food is indiscernible from each other.  Having said that, I like them all.  In particular, El Campesino has very fast service and great food.  Very consistent each time I have gone - which is dozens.  Food often will come out before you even make a dent in the complimentary chips and salsa!  And this location is totally remodeled!  Very nice inside with new carpet, stone columns, new bar, and new dining room arrangement.  New lighting too.  VERY nice atmosphere now.  A step up from the old decor where they just came in and inhabitated what was previously there.  A step up from most of these other authentic mexican places as well.  Love their chicken fajitas that come out on a sizzling skillet.  I recommend asking for extra tortillas as they only give you three.  Their guacamole is fantastic too!"}
{"text":"I crave mexican food about once a week maybe twice.  This place is pretty spot on, Mcknight Road is a good spot for (another) Campies. As is every El Campesino, the margaritas are delish, the service is without fault, and the food ALWAYS comes out in a jiffy!  I always do a combo platter.  It's the best deal for your money (I feel).  But they do sell Tacos A La Carte and all the sides a la carte.  The salsa is good, not overly spiced or flavorful, but decent."}
{"text":"There is no good or authentic Mexican food in Pittsburgh that I have found so far, but this is terrible.  There are several other \"authentic\" Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh that are at least edible.  Having lived in California and eaten at many Mexican restaurants throughout the West where they have extremely large populations of Mexicans, nothing here is even close.  My wife won't even let us go to a Mexican restaurant here because they are all bad.  Objectively though, the food was poorly prepared, flavorless, and they put what tasted like packaged brown gravy mix all over my food, yuck!!!  If you are going to eat Mexican in Pittsburgh, the very best by far is Iguana Grill on the South Side."}
{"text":"Well, after six plus months traveling every other week to Pittsburgh, I finally found a Mexican food place that I liked.   Not a killer inside, but relaxing, cool, and efficient.  Service was great, and my steak burrito was amazing.   This place proves to me that you don't have to have some over fancy state of the art exterior to cook good food and give good service.    I was here last in October, so I see some recent reviews say the service is poor... I'll have to check it out and hope maybe it was a hiccup, and we'll see in January !!"}
{"text":"We started coming to El Campesino EL CAMP in McMurray 16 weeks ago.  Said we would come back each Thursday until we had a bad meal.  16 weeks and counting - we are still here - food is fabulous - chicken tortilla soup, tamales, pollo loco, chile verde -  all terrific.  Do yourself a favor - visit El Camp when you need a nice relaxing evening and great food."}
{"text":"Service is always fast and friendly. Love the feel of the restaurant and the people in it. The chorizo cheese appetizer is absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Yikes not great Mexican food.  I decided to try this place instead of Buffalo Wild Wings to avoid a crazy crowd and maybe have something fresher than fried wings but that decision did not work out so well.  I selected a combo plate of fried cheese basically not really realizing just how much cheese was going to cover all of the items.    I do understand and expect a taquito to be fried and quesadillas are at their core, grilled cheese. But the poblano which generally brings the flavor to a dish was just drowned out by the cheese which was the root of my disappointment - the cheese itself was the lowest quality grade cheese which I liken to a Velveeta fake cheese consistency.  If you want to just have a margarita and nachos maybe, then I don't think you will be that disappointed.  I wish I had seen the prior reviews for this place but I forgot my phone in the car - there were a couple photos that would have clued me in to how low quality the food is.  I really want small businesses to succeed over chain restaurants but ya gotta at least TRY.  I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because the staff seemed nice."}
{"text":"I am a little surprised that this place has close to 4 stars. Maybe I just ordered the wrong things?  I got the sangria and #11 - beef everything. Now, I love ground beef but ground beef without seasoning is just scary.  And I knew coming here would be far from authentic (the coupon drove me to do it) but... Gosh, lots and lots of beef. I did like the chips that are served in the beginning of the meal with the mild salsa. Alas, if I get sick, this place may get downgraded a star or two. Oh well; this was food, I think. (Best thing was the rice, joking aside.)"}
{"text":"I have to write about how terrible this place is. The food is okay. The service, however, is a whole other problem this place just doesn't seem to get. It's night and day compared to their store on Mc Knight road. The bar was a mess and the bartender kept disappearing for long periods of time every time we asked for something. She was nice, but there was no steps of service what so ever. It took 10 mins just to get a menu cause she kept disappearing. It's took 10 mins to get waters for us. She even disappeared for that.  I would advise to go to their location on Mc Knight Rd where the service is by far WAY better or got to Emiliano's. Seriously."}
{"text":"Was visiting the Kent area for a short weekend, and had dinner here.  Overall, food service was awesome.  They had to suddenly accommodate 17 of us, but was able to do it even with the restaurant quickly filling up.  Eventually, we were split up into two tables, but it worked out well.  Drinks were given out without too much incident.  Getting our order took a bit longer because they had to do many things, such as making sure both tables had their drinks, and that no more of our party was trickling in.  Food was given to us pretty quickly considering our large group.  As for the food itself, it wasn't bad at all.  I was raised in California, where lots of good Mexican food is located.  However, El Campesino by itself was really good and pretty tasty.  They made sure we had a good supply of chips and salsa, as well as our drinks being full.  The chips were always fresh and still warm, and well-made.  As a note, the given salsa is not spicy.    Overall, I was impressed by their service and how well they dealt with the restaurant being completely full.    Credit cards are accepted.  Parking can be a little difficult at times depending on what time you may come in (we came in on Saturday evening), but it's not too bad."}
{"text":"Chips very fresh, desserts had pretty plating and delicious.  Waiter checked in often, prefer this location over Streetsboro. Will be back, desserts super affordable!"}
{"text":"I ordered a chile relleno, which is made with guess what? Relleno chiles. What I was served was a stuffed green bell pepper. It reminded me of the stuffed peppers my mom made when I was a kid. I didn't like them then, still don't like them now. I would have rather they explain to me they were out of the right ingredients so I could pick a different dish, but I guess they thought I wouldn't know the difference. My husband and I also ordered margaritas which were watered down. Not good Mexican food, won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been to many mexican restaurants in the greater Pittsburgh area and the is one of the best. I moved here from California and this is by far one of the most authentic. Most places here tend to disappoint me. I come here often with my husband and daughter. She's 3 years old and even she loves it. I have never had anything bad here and because of how often I frequent this place, I've tried a good portion of the menu. The staff is always super friendly and they are very quick with your order. They make really good margaritas as well . This is definitely one of my favorite spots!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"There is one word for this restaurant: bland. We ordered the mango and raspberry margarita, and two combinations: a burrito, enchilada and rice/refried beans and a burrito,  enchilada and tostada. Total: $46.  The margaritas tasted like nothing.  No flavor and certainly no alcohol. My fiancé left his entire drink behind.   The burritos are filled with bland ground beef (they don't ask for a meat preference) and dabbed with red sauce. No cheese, tomatoes, lettuce or sour cream.   The rice is also bland. The Tostada consists of a hard tortilla, refried beans that taste like them are from a can, lettuce and a tomato.   Everything here is a watered down, bland mess. And to top it off, the service is equally bland and uninviting."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. The poblanos are the best thing I've had. Tamales and fajitas are also excellent! The margaritas are strong and tasty. You really can't go wrong and the service and price are great.  *Edit: I recently got the Pollo con Crema and it was delicious. You'll need extra tortillas, but it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Went here with 2 of my friends and we all got different items on the menu. My burritos were definitely the best out of the 3 meals. Covered in sour cream, red sauce, and guacamole, my beef and bean burritos were pretty good. Not the best Mexican food I've ever had but pretty good and filled me up. My friends' meals consisted of two only beef burritos with minimal sauce and fajitas that looked a bit mushy and weren't sizzling on the skillet when they came to the table. For the price they paid, I don't think they got enough value"}
{"text":"After moving from Napa, California to Pittsburgh, it's been hard to find good authentic ANYTHING... Well we found a gem today with this place, the food was good, place was clean and our server Ramon was THE BEST!!!!"}
{"text":"I agree that I wish they had stayed independent, but the food is still good!  It's definitely my favorite place to eat Mexican food n Monroeville (if not all of Pittsburgh).  The waitstaff is always pleasant, the prices are good, and the food is good!  The chips and salsa are definitely my favorite... might be going there tonight! :-)    The chile poblanos are fantastic!  It's also nice that their Mexican rice is vegetarian (others use chicken broth)."}
{"text":"took my mother here at her request one day.  i'm not big into the cookie cutter feel of the north hills so i usually avoid heading in that direction.  she had been here before so i capitulated and was not disappointed in the least.  very great atmosphere.  the view from the top dining area down into the fountain is very nice.  very authentic flavor too.  i grew up in san diego so i am very familiar with mexican food.  i cant remember what mom had but i had the enchiladas with the tomitillo sauce.  we both loved our dishes.  the service was well above par.  our waiter was very courteous and patient as my mother is hard of hearing.  he kept our iced teas constantly full during a mediocre early dinner rush.  two of us, just dinner, no dessert and with tip it was about $30.  acceptable."}
{"text":"Service is on point and friendly.  Food is tasty and portions are large.  Prices aren't bad, fairly reasonable.    It is at the level of your typical Mexican restaurant, free chips and salsa, food comes out ridiculously fast and with a large portion of beans and rice, and menu is endless.  I definitely plan to return, my wife and I were craving Mexican food and it hit the spot.  Defintely more flavorful than Mad Mex and more food for the price too."}
{"text":"Love the Roqueto Burrito. Tons of shredded pork. I get it almost every time. They have great margaritas as well. Service is very friendly and you never wait for a table. Nice big patio for the summer."}
{"text":"This place is really good, and much more authentic than Mad Mex. I've only been here for lunch, but I was pretty impressed. It's also my understanding that it looks much nicer now than it did in the old building they had (which I had not visited). It was quite clean, the service was great, and I was pretty happy with the meal.  It's also next to one of my favorite chinese places, China Palace, which is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Holy bejebus this place was better than expected. Went there last night with Sarah S. I got the Chiles Poblanos, which I have had before other places, but the waiter said was his fav. AMAZING. Hands down the best I have ever had, and I lived in the Hispanic section of Columbia, SC for 6 years. Sarah S. had the veggie fajita, it had tomatoes and cauliflower and broccoli, which is not my cup of tea, but she was excited about it. The salsa was also pretty good, and spicy.  Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I ordered the Carne con Asada tacos and they were soooooo gooooood! I also ordered the Guacamole Dip. I enjoyed the meal. I will definitely return when I come back to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"This was by far my favorite place to get Mexican in Robinson. The prices were dirt cheap and the service was always fast. The food was ALWAYS really good.  El Campesino has the best salsa I've ever had. Maybe it's just my preference, maybe I have no idea what a good salsa is but I absolutely love it. I disagree with the rice comments and think all of their food has always been consistent and delicious. I've been to El Campesino almost weekly for a while; I like Mexican food that much.  The chips are always warm, too, which is a simple gesture but makes all the difference. Honestly, the place is pretty gringo-friendly but it has its charm. You probably wouldn't find anything on their menu in a restaurant on the other side of the US nor would you find it south of the border but you get what you can out of Pittsburgh..."}
{"text":"BAD FOOD EVEN WORSE SERVICE. Let's start with the fact that I was told appetizers and margaritas was half off. I order the cheese dip that, although runny was decent tasting and the Margarita was honestly great. I ordered a vegetarian dish which apparently means I only eat cheese wrapped up in dough and smothered in bland, most likely canned sauce. My friend got the chicken Taco salad and couldn't finish more than a few bites of her boiled chicken over lettuce, although the tortilla bowl it was in was nicely crisp. When the check came  we noticed inconsistencies and we're told with no apologies that our appetizer wasn't among the nachos, not appetizers,  that were half off. On top of that we had a coupon that was from a 2014 coupon book but it expired a year before in 2013. THEY PRINTED THE COUPON ALMOST A YEAR EXPIREDD, so it could never be used. Oh may I add that the ceiling in the booth behind us started raining water from the ceiling. I saw waiters walk by repeatedly before I said something. No puddle was mopped,  they just put buckets around. We decided to ask for a manager when they again over charged us at payment. The check was $32 and when me and my friends got our card statement to sign it came back $20 each.... Do the math. It took 35 min for a manager who refused to comp us anything reasonable. We eventually walked out without signing anything and refusing to pay. The restaurant then charged our cards the initial $20, which was more than we even ordered. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. I still tipped the waiter for taking his time and table."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE FOOD AND EVEN WORSE SERVICE! Lets start with the fact that when I walked in I was told that the specials were half off appetizers margaritas. I decided to order a margarita, which I have to say was great. I also got cheese dip, which although runny, did not taste bad. I ordered from the vegetarian menu for my main course, which I guess means I only eat cheese wrapped up different ways and drowned in bland, most likely canned sauce. My friend ordered the chicken taco salad, which was basically boiled chicken over lettuce. However, her tortilla bowl the salad was in was nice and crispy. Lets note that the booth behind us started raining from the ceiling. I watched several servers walk by and do nothing. I finally told my server and he put buckets around without even mopping up the existing puddle. Apon receiving the check I was told, unapologetically, that the server was mistaken and nachos were actually what was half off and I received no discount. I also had a coupon, which after much arguing I noticed that THE COUPON WAS PRINTED OFF AFTER IT SUPPOSEDLY EXPIRED, therefore it was never possible to redeem it. My check was $32 and when split between me and my friend we got our statements to sign back as $20 each...do the math (we were charged extra from the check). I asked to speak with a manager based on everything. it took 35 minutes to finally get a manager, who wanted to argue and refuse to be reasonable. After $40 minutes of ridiculousness. I decided not to sign and refuse to pay. The restaurant ended up charging me $20, without my authorization (more than I even ordered). I plan on desputing this."}
{"text":"terrible terrible attentiveness at front door tried to sit 2 of us on top of a screaming kid bd party...at a dirty 4 top table said the next booth over was reserved moved us back to the queue we ended up asking if we could seat ourselves at a hightop in the lounge...they answered yes but did not follow with menus TOOK FOREVER to get waited on...over 15 minutes just for drinks then about another 15 to order food server kept forgetting stuff, menus, pico, extra chips for the way too hot salsa, silverware, the rice i ordered  the ala cart prices were reasonable but the dinner items seemed high $5.50 for 3 tacos.  the ground beef was flavorless and looked like canned dog food there was so much cheese on them, i couldn't see inside the lettuce was wilted nothing else was served with them (tomato, onion, sour cream).  the way they were plated (on the side on top of each other) made them soggy instead of standing them upright (hard shell, turned to mushy soft shell) the rice was cold and tasted like nothing more than salt  my companion didn't like her meal either, a taco, something weird looking that she said was flavorless, rice, and beans that looked like something i won't describe.  between the food and service, I WOULD NOT COME BACK HERE"}
{"text":"Ate here recently on my quest to find authentic Mexican in Summit Co, per my hair stylist who is California raised.   Asked the server about the mole, she said she makes better mole at home (I appreciate her honesty), so I passed on that one and just got a combo platter.  My family order a special and a menu item.  Not bad, not a ton of flavor though.  Didn't have a stomach ache all night or any other issues.  I guess this is my new Mexican place for the time being.  Atmosphere is noisy.  Got to hear the torid details of the girl across the aisle's love life while we were eating.  I might try take out next time."}
{"text":"Three reasons I would ever go back: 1. Guacamole--best I've had in a restaurant  2. Shredded beef  3. The drinks are cheap Other than that, this place is just your generic canned refried beans and pre-mixed margarita joint."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre and the margaritas are terrible. I'd suggest Salsita's if you're looking for a standard Mexican fix."}
{"text":"My favorite dinner option is the Rancheros Enchiladas sampler that arrives dressed w/ tomato, lettuce, sour cream, melted cheese, and very fresh enchilada red sauce. You get one each of ground beef, shredded beef, shredded chicken, cheese, and bean enchiladas. Yum!  These are best eaten w/ either a house margarita on the rocks (they use Hornitos Tequila which is just okay or you can \"buy up\" to premium Tequilas) or a frosted mug filled w/ amber Dos Equis draft beer.  Their food is not very fancy nor spicy - it's very plain homestyle Mexican. Their salsa is good but a little on the bland side - it could use more layers of flavor.   The most disappointing thing was the STRONG disinfectant smell wafting past our table situated near the foyer/lavatories. Blech! Hate that!  It's a great place for families and large groups w plenty of free parking and enough menu options to please everyone."}
{"text":"Ordered two chicken enchiladas with a side of rice. It was decent for the price, I smothered everything in queso cheese and all was delicious! This is your standard Mexican restaurant, nothing extra to make them stand out."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I met our friend here for lunch. The food was fresh and the quantity was huge. The price point was also right on task. The chips and salsa and queso were good.   Our quesadillas were huge both steak and chicken. We love supporting local places. The service was also high quality."}
{"text":"decent food and good ambiance....not as tasty as El Meson, in cuyahoga falls, but better seating and ambiance.  I recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you want Chimichangas, Gorditas, Churros or any other Amerimex abomination, go to Taco Bell. If you want good, traditional Mexican fare, go to Mexico. But, like most of us who dont have the time to take a lunch trip south of the border and live in the Pittsburgh area, thankfully there is El Campesino. My girlfriend recommended this place to me as we both have a constant hankering for good Mexican, and I was pleasantly surprised. Being from California, I am very picky about my \"Mexican\" food and am glad that traditional fare has made its way to Robinson.   Try the Carne Asada Tacos or the the Chile Colorado, you will not be disappointed. The flavors are savory and have the right amount of spice. If you are feeling frisky, use some of their Habeñero salsa, it will make that beef oh so right. The Queso dip is also stellar and is a great start to any meal.  Look for coupons in mailers and enjoy this little gem. Oh and if you want Tex-Mex, go to Chilis."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 3 stars but there was hair in my fish taco. And the hair wasn't mine   And then they only replaced the one taco. The others were cold. Not impress. I've had better"}
{"text":"El Campesino is a good place to go for lunch since they get you in and out rather quickly.  They may have the best salsa in the city.  Their other items are serviceable.  I don't care too much for their Enchiladas, but their tacos and burritos are better.  The rice and beans are solid.  They do carry my favorite green hot sauce, which is also a plus I like the place, but don't love it."}
{"text":"I love this place. Went on a Sunday with a party of 3. Music was jamming on the speakers and service was so prompt.   Parking is great because it's within a shopping strip. Ample parking for the restaurant.   The menu is pretty vast. When you sit down you get free chips and some deee lisshusss salsa. Order the queso dip. It's a great addition to the free chips and salsa. I wanted a cherry Pepsi but they didn't have that, but they were able to make it for me. The server added a bit of grenadine to my Pepsi and voila it was cherry flavored!  I also wanted a little alcoholic libation. The Sangria is strong!!! But good like I like it!   I ordered the enchiladas rancheras. Loved them. You get 5 different enchiladas with 2beef, 1 chicken,  1 cheese and one filled with beans. The bean and cheese were my favorite ones. My husband got the quesadilla fajita. It's his favorite dish there.   There's tons of space in the restaurant. Saw a couple of large parties. The only con about the place are the booths. The seats aren't that comfortable to me. The backs of the booth have very little give..so you have to sit either straight up or lean over your table a bit to be comfortable. Next time, I'll probably choose a table with chairs and not a booth. Overall, food and drinks were on point!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of El Camp (as us locals call it) and have been eating there for around 9 years. Ever since my first visit to now the quality of service and taste has been consistently great. You always get complimentary warm and fresh chips with salsa as soon as you sit down. I also like to get the bean dip with the chips. They have an extensive menu ranging from salads to burritos - what you would expect at a typical Mexican restaurant. So far I have never been let down by something on the menu. Everything is prepared fresh and the portions are big. If you are looking for quality authentic Mexican food in the South Hills area, El Camp can definitely satisfy the craving."}
{"text":"Food was horrible,, ordered chicken enchiladas they were so nasty. Taste like it's been in the freezer for couple days and they defrost it and reheat it. I tried my wife's burritos also, not so much different. Our server wasn't very attentive either, didn't even bother to ask if everything were fine etc. not even a refill. we didn't even eat our food and decided to leave after paying $40 for the food we didn't eat. I was thinking about addressing this to the manager but he was too busy flirting with his host. Never again to go back to this place."}
{"text":"El Crapesino!! Completely dissatisfied with this restaurant. Typically when you order fajitas you get a pretty decent size portion. Not here!! Plus, the minimal steak and chicken I had was literally burnt to black!! Terrible. I barely had enough to make a second fajita wrap, let alone a third. For the price this was absolutely pathetic.  Never going back. Took a bunch of friends thinking this would be a great local mexican restaurant to go, nope! !!!! Get a clue el crapesino. Too bad I didn't take pictures of the charred steak and chicken I received.... Oh and our waiter, with the braces, was not very nice at all.."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I went here today for lunch. It was 3:30 on a Sunday, so it wasn't very crowded. We were seated right away, brought warm, fresh chips and salsa, and had our drinks in the first 5 minutes of being there. We then ordered  -- he got Burrito de la Roqueta (\"pork burrito with onions, topped with special green sauce, rice and beans\"), I got the quesadilla verde (which has nothing green in it, btw.. hehe) which comes with a choice of beef done one of 3 ways or chicken done one of two ways and is \"served with lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, guacamole and rice\". I chose the grilled chicken. Our food came out very quickly and very hot (I swear.. maybe we were just talking and people-watching too much, but it seemed like it was 10 minutes later).   Our waiter was nice and friendly and he was VERY good at making sure drinks were refilled before they were totally empty, which is something we both highly prize. Boyfriend would have liked more veggies with his, and we both thought that this place could use a lesson in spicing things up (no salt on the chips, no kick to either of the meats in our dishes, slightly bland). However, other than that, it was still pretty decent Mexican food. I suppose you'd say it's a bit more of an Americanized-tasting Mexican place. We'd both totally go back here, though, especially because of the service."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and saw employees standing around and when they saw me they scattered to look busy. I had to call out to bartender that I wanted to order. I ordered and the food was done in 1 min. How Sway?! The food isn't fresh. It seemed like it was heated in the microwave. I could've went to Taco Bell across the street for that. They used to be good but fell off. Such a shame."}
{"text":"El Campie!! How I love you!! Seriously excellent all around - food, service, drinks, staff, everything! The only complaint I have is that I can never get enough queso!!   In all seriousness, this is an amazing place for Mexican food. I have never had anything bad here. I usually split fajitas and add an order of their corn Tortilla. Everything is always fresh, seasoned perfectly, and oh so delicious. On top of that, your food comes out lightning fast!   Go here ASAP and order a medium margarita, queso, and any meal on the menu. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Meh.....Thats all i can say about El Campesino. Good prices, but boring.  Not terrible though."}
{"text":"I get the Fajita El Campasino, it is always wonderful.  The chip, cheese dip and salsa is very good. But I love the tomatillo  salsa  you order, has a very nice hot kick to it. We always have great food, great service and s nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wait staff was kind, chips and salsa were plentiful. Sadly, the food itself was over priced and typical over cooked, warming line, assembly style Mexican-American food.  Overall, the experience was sterile, the food was bland, and I will choose to never return.   I know Mexican food, and you sir are no Mexican food."}
{"text":"Fast service, chips and salsa arrive just after we sat down. Good selection of food for all ages. Plates come out extremely hot. Prices are very reasonable. A good place to chill, eat or get some drinks."}
{"text":"One of the more original Mexican places I've been to. When a Mexican restaurant does not cover everything in cheese, you know they got it right.  The menu is a bit overwhelming with 25 combination platters, a variety of enchiladas and about half a dozen burritos.  I recommend the shredded beef burrito; cant say the same of the chicken enchilada, thought others in my table liked it.  It is very reasonably priced.  Each one of us ate, had chips and soft drinks for under $15."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars because the severice is so fast!Today I was there with my Mother and friends,we just ordered.2 quick minutes later the food was here,excellent,hot,and delicious!"}
{"text":"Worst mexican food in whole of Monroeville. Been there twice and the food was cold and the plate it came in was smoking hot! Neither it tasted any good. Drinks were fine 2 stars for that only and the cleanliness"}
{"text":"I don't like giving bad reviews, but I was very disappointed in the taste and quality of the food.  Not sure what part of Mexico this cuisine comes from.   This just was not my cup of tea!"}
{"text":"UGHHH!!!   This place was soo bad, I've become angry all over again while writing this review. My girlfriend and I both got sick from our combination platters. The food tasted old, decrepit, and mundane.   The crappy Mexican music they play in the background of every Mexican restaurant kept skipping, and skipping, and skipping, over and over again. If this wasn't the seventh layer of hell, I don't know what was.  I couldn't wait to get out of there as soon as I sat down. The booths are so uncomfortable, my back hurts just thinking about sitting in that awkward, wooden bench.  Our server never ever showed up to see how our food was. He didn't suggest anything, he just took our order, disappeared, then brought out our food. Our food was served to us probably 5 minutes after we ordered it. How is food supposed to be fresh if it doesn't take longer than 5 minutes for the order to go in and the food to come out?  I will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"I'll say upfront that I'm picky about Mexican food having lived in Texas for sometime.  I full well understand that real Mexican food is tough to come by up north.   With that being said, I think El Campesino suffices as a serviceable Mexican restaurant in the North HIlls region.  When you walk in, you definitely feel a change as the decor screams Mexican.  The bar region, where I sat during my visit, was nicely appointed.  Plenty of Mexican beers on tap for those who are so inclined.  The bar service outside the immediate stools facing the bar-tender was a tad bit slow, especially with regards to food.  Speaking of the food: it's good, but nothing to write-home about.  Just your standard gringo corn-flake chips with watery salsa.  I had the cheese enchiladas which were full of goodness, but didn't necessarily pack the desired punch that I was looking for.  Despite its shortcomings, having decent Mexican food at basement prices is a fantastic thing.  And for that, I'm grateful."}
{"text":"I have been to El Campesino a few times.  I am not the biggest Mexican fan, except for tacos which I could eat every day.  My biggest problem with most Mexican restaurants is how most everything on the plate looks like slop.  You got the slop of beans the slop of something covered in sauce, and the slop of something else that isn't recognizable.  So that being said, as sloppy as a lot of dishes look that is about how impressed I am with the taste.  Not that great, and tastes like it looks.    So the past two times I went to El Campesino was for lunch with a co-worker.  They have a lunch menu that ranges in price of 6.99-10.99, give or take a dollar.  They do have tacos on this menu, but they are the very generic ground beef, lettuce, and tomato tacos.  I won't pay 6+ dollars plus tip for something I can make at home for 4 people under $5.00.  So I opted for this trio type of plate.  It was a guacamole salad, with beans and rice, one soft beef taco, and a Poblano Pepper (relleno) with cheese.  The salad came out first.  Hmm, not what I thought it would be but then again I have nothing to compare it to.  Apparently a guacamole salad is just shredded lettuce with a scoop of Guac on the top.  Who would have thunk it right?  Well I really like guacamole so it was ok, just thought there would be more to it.  The rest of my food came out and yep, as predicted minus the taco that was on a separate plate, the other plate looked like slop on slop.  Everything ran together.  The relleno was a joke.  The cheese melted overtop of the teeny tiny, sliver of pepper I found underneath.  I was expecting a whole pepper, not just a piece that I could eat in one bite.  The filling was meh and the beans and rice I skipped after a bite.  The taco was okay, but messy.  Not always a bad thing, unless you're talking about grease rolling down your hand/arm.  This is the messy I speak of.  So my co-worker is going back again and I say \"sure I'll go\" knowing I really wanted to try something else and hopefully it would be good.  Funny cause we met up with a group of people he used to work with and the one guy said to me, \"I bet you aren't getting the same thing you did last time?\"  He clearly witnessed my dismay for the first lunch.  I opted for fajitas since I know I like fajitas.  Of course they are the most expensive item on the lunch menu, but I really thought I would like them.  Well I can say they were okay.  The beef was so overcooked it was tough.  It came with some guacamole, Pico De Gallo, shredded lettuce, sour cream, and was served with onions and peppers in the cast iron skillet.  They only provided me with three tortillas.  I could have used 5 since they were small and I don't like overstuffing my shell, but I didn't want to ask for more because I wasn't sure if they would charge me for them.  Again it was ok, but not great.  I'm sure I will be back since this seems like a common lunch stop for my co-worker.  Special shout out to El Campesino, they do give you a basket of free chips and salsa with your order, but I believe they charge for refills."}
{"text":"This place was \"OK\" but certainly not the delicious Mexican food I've been searching for in the Pittsburgh area... Oh well. I guess I would say the food was decent but not exciting and I don't have any strong desire to return. The tortilla chips were pretty good although the salsa was somewhat subpar and the chicken enchiladas were nothing special."}
{"text":"Salsa is delicious with a mild zip to it. Chips are thin and crispy.  Had the super enchiladas very tasty and plenty to fill the tummy.  When I'm back in the area I will eat here again."}
{"text":"I *love* El Campesino. My fiance and I go there as often as we can because the food is amazing. I highly recommend the chicken fajita quesadilla. I get it each and every time."}
{"text":"This is a great standard Mexican restaurant, if you've been to a Mex. restaurant before you wouldn't necessarily need to open the menu, except for the Burrito Rocheta (sp?). We have been here at least 6 times and my husband has ordered it 5 times and that 6th time, he regretted it! Its a pulled pork burrito with salsa verde on top and a bit of pico de gallo on that.   The reason for the 4 stars (not 5) is that its always hot in there! Even though it was 40degrees outside,it was at least 75 degrees inside, yuck. (I hate being hot)"}
{"text":"Not the most creative Mexican menu, but hey it's Mexican food in Pittsburgh.  I had a shrimp and cheese appetizer that was delicious. The name of escapes me now, all I remember is that it was tasty lol."}
{"text":"I love the food here; always tasty.  I always choose one of the vegetarian combos.  They also have delicious chips and salsa.  The downside is the service is essentially  non-existent--leaving you to basically tackle servers to get refills, etc."}
{"text":"We have just moved from CA to PA and were looking for a good Mexican restaurant.  We tried a few other places since we got here and they weren't very good. El Campesino isn't quite to the level of the really good Mexican restaurants in LA, but it is pretty darn good.  The service was great and the food was tasty.  Portions are fine and all in all, we were very pleased with our visit.  When we want Mexican food in PA, this will be the place."}
{"text":"Went to the one in \"The Point\".  It was horrible.  The one in Monroville was good way back, but let me tell you this is BAD.  How about serving a chiles rellenos with a green bell pepper?  Are you kidding me?  The salsa had an old chip in it.   Did it come from another table?  People are out of their minds thinking this is good.  Dirty, run down and horrible.  Can't believe anyone would rate it high!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The chicken in the fajita was moist and well seasoned. The burrito Campesino was huge and tasty. The chips and salsa were great.  It is pretty nice inside. However we never got our piña colada and they don't have horchata nor agua de piña."}
{"text":"Great drinks at El Campesino, food is good, sometimes great, sometimes OK. Service is fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood Mexican food, an easy go to. Nothing that's going to knock your socks off but fine for a casual close by restaurant when you want quick Mexican."}
{"text":"This is my wife and My favorite place for Mexican. The Salas's great the fajitas is my go to but I've never had anything bad there. The family that runs it are great and their staff is also great!"}
{"text":"El campesino is a pretty solid Mexican option for the North Hills. The food came out shockingly fast, it was good, not great, and very well priced. Our bartender/server was very friendly and quick with a drink.   We used a restaurant.com gift card and they were very accomodating. Our server even offered to split the check in half and evenly apply the gift card code my friend and I."}
{"text":"OMG! The food and drinks were so good. Our server was awesome and gave very good recommendations. The only negative is the salsa. It was bland and runny/watery, but other than that, the food was delicious!  The portions are large and the prices reasonable. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and was pleasantly surprised. I'm from Arizona so Mexican food is my comfort food and I am pretty picky about it. Our waiter was great and went above and beyond to make it a good experience.   My son couldn't decide weather he wanted lemonade or orange juice so our waiter brought him both at no additional charge. The chips and salsa were good. The chips were a bit thick for my liking but as I said Im  picky. The salsa was spicy which I LOVED!!! I did squeeze a bit of lime in it but that's a taste thing. I was disappointed that they didn't have horchata. If you know where I can get some in the Burgh PLEASE let me know!!! I had the chicken chimi. It was good. The guacamole was yummy and the chicken was tender. Got an enchilada for my boy which was a huge portion for his little 4 year old self. He loved the rice. He ate that before anything else. The other half had fajitas with shrimp steak and chicken. I stole a few of his onions and they were well seasoned and yummy. We went with the fried ice cream for dessert which we all shared. It was ok. Not true fried ice cream but still ok for what it was. (Try it with honey a shot of baileys and kahlua its how we eat it back home. We omitted the liquor since the little man was eating it with us.) I will definitely come back here when I'm needing a taste of home. It's not filibertos or macyos but it will definitely do."}
{"text":"There was literally not a single soul in this joint. I mentioned this, and was told it was the time of day to I must not be from around here or I would know.  Happy hour is from 4-7 it's 4 pm....and happy hour is happening somewhere else. And after eating the food I can see why. It took less than 3 min to get my food. Ordered the #5 the meat was cold and my cheese enchilada was still shredded cheese. In other words they didn't care enough to even heat it up. I am sitting here watching the manager in the bar on his phone in the bar drinking beer.  Kind of sums it up. Food in this joint puts the foos from a CAN in Mexican. Read and heed, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Another serviceable Mexican place in the area. Their shredded chicken tacos are really good, but they're not on the menu from my recollection. Just ask for them and get extra salsa to douse them along with some sour cream. Delicious.  Chips came out room temperature  and the serving of guacamole was small for the price. They're having some food expediting issues (fajitas arrived w/o tortillas). Overall, decent place with friendly people."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. A go to local spot. The staff is crazy friendly and the patio is awesome. So quiet and spaced out, a little oasis.  Food was fresh, tasty, and quick, they bring you chips and salsa continuously which is awesome. Love their Mexican rice and the only place that doesn't serve me tacos sitting in their own juice and get soggy. YES! LOVE the shredded chicken, burritos, and taco salads. Come try this place, and the table side guac!   UPDATE: they do a very good job with take out and a lot of places don't. Nothing is soggy, same portions as dining in, and same quality! Its packaged well too. They even give you chips and salsa to go! Nice touch."}
{"text":"This is the nicest of the El Camps in the Pittsburgh Area that I've been to so far.  The review for food and service is the same as the Monroeville location.  Great marks for both food, service and consistency. We went tonight and our waiter, Jesus, was awesome!  We wanted for nothing the entire time we were there.  :) He was great!  (I do think its a taaaad overpriced though.  Not by a gross amount, but a bit off)"}
{"text":"The food was good.  My chips and salsa were kind of boring and flavorless so I got scared.  I ordered a combo of make your own tortillas and it was GOOD!  The fried ice cream was also GOOD!  I wish the decor was more modernized Mexican and not so juvenille."}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent service. Friendly staff. Everything was perfect. If you're looking for a family friendly Mexican restaurant El Campesino is the way to go! I will defiantly be going back and also the fried ice cream  is to die for :)"}
{"text":"Not good good at all.  Been here twice, wasn't going to come back but friend convinced me to give it another try and that was a waste of money.  Go to Patrons if you want good Mexican food.  Food was bla."}
{"text":"I have been eating at El Campesino (Monroeville) for the past 20 years.  The food is absolutely wonderful & reasonably priced.  I have dined at three different locations (McMurray and Robinson, additionally)  and it is always delicious.  The servers are friendly and the food arrives at your table FAST."}
{"text":"We come here every time we're in the Pittsburgh area. Super friendly staff and the food's always amazing."}
{"text":"Quick service, friendly staff, and low prices make up for some of El Campesino's short comings in overall food quality.  Their complimentary chips and salsa are freshly made, delicious and vary from day-to-day in taste: sometimes the garlic is heavier than the cilantro in the salsa, and sometimes it's just the opposite.  Most ground beef dishes come with a meat that I cannot recommend, but if you stick with shredded chicken, shredded beef, refried beans (i.e., chilupa), or steak (Mexican Tacos), you'll experience a five-star course."}
{"text":"After reading over other people's reviews for this place I'm baffled.  From the reviews it seems like you either have to love it or hate it.    When we walked in we technically weren't greeted by a host/hostess.  But we were greeted nonetheless.  One party ahead of us must of been a frequent visitor as they asked for a specific server and they gladly sat them there.  We were then promptly seated and our server was at our table side in an instant.  Drink orders placed, delivered and chips and salsa brought to us.  The server gave us a few minutes to browse the menu.  For not being at any of their locations before, it took a while to decide what I wanted.  I opted for the burritos deluxe: one chicken and bean, one beef and bean.  After we placed our orders I swear it was not even ten minutes later and our food arrived at our table.  Not only did it arrive quickly, but HOT, I mean so hot that when they tell you to be careful of the plate you still have to touch it and curse under your breath.  Two good sized burritos filled with everything you expect to find, topped with shredded lettuce, sour cream, red sauce and a huge slice of tomato.  The mixture of flavors was very good.  I also got a margarita, nothing special about that, a margarita is a margarita.  Why not four stars?  At the end of our dinner it was like they were rushing us out.  They placed the check on our table and walked by almost every two minutes.  I could understand if they were busy, but on Super Bowl Sunday no one was out."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! It has to be by far the best Mexican restaurant around! All the waiters are great. Never have to wait on a refill for anything and the food they serve is always more then enough. We always have to leave with a box of left overs. The drinks are really good, my husband always gets the margarita with the corona in it.. Prices are very reasonable. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Sadly there is no place for ZERO STARS!!! I WILL NEVER COME BACK! EVER!!!!  This place does not care for you or how you want your food. Zero respect for the customer.  I ordered my lunch here with my GF and when it came it was covered in sour cream, which I emphatically specified that I can't eat when I ordered. So when I said I don't want it since I requested no sour cream, THEY WENT IN THE BACK AND SCRAPED IT OFF!!!!! Bringing the dish right back out covered in white smear that was attempted to be hidden by some extra lettuce.   WHAT A JOKE. Never go back. EVER!!!! Shit hole!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican food and worth many return trips, and I have made a few! Like best, drinks: House Margarita's. Buy by the pitcher. Bartenders are excellent. Like best, apps.: nachos beef and nachos chicken. Both are very tasty. Lied best, soup: Chicken soup. Served pipping hot with lots of good chicken. Like best, entrees: Enchiladas Campesinas, three chicken enchiladas, with Mexican rice and guacamole and sour cream. Like best, service: fast, courteous and food pronto. Really a good stand by option.  Long lines are not an impediment since they moved into their new and larger location in Monroeville. Plus now they have 3 large TVs in the bar area side of the restaurant. This section has high tables and bar seats."}
{"text":"El Camp used to be one of my absolute favorite places to grab Mexican food. However, the last few rimes I have been extremely disappointed.  This week our service was horrible, even though it was a Monday and the restaurant was not busy.  Our server didn't ask if we wanted more chips, or another beer.   My vegetable fajitas came out and looked SO SAD. I'm 99.9% sure they forgot completely to put any seasoning on my vegetables.   Worst food (other than rice & beans, but you can't really mess those up) that I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Because I had been to other El Camp locations, I knew this would be a good choice for lunch take out for my mommy friends while the kiddos played at nearby (same plaza) Lilliput.  I called at 11:15 on a Thursday and asked that the order be ready by 12. Not a problem. When I arrived, everything was ready and still warm. Always a good sign. I went with the 3 tacos ( for under $6, you can't beat it) and added guacamole. You are able to choose soft or hard shell as well as beef or chicken. The tacos were as delicious as I remembered. My toddler loved them. The best part of the meal was the guac. I love that their guac is flavorful and full of onion and tomato pieces. So often I find that the guac at Mexican restaurants is an underwhelming mush of avocado and some spices. I love that El Camps adds not only flavor but also nutrition by folding in onions and tomatoes. Even though this $3.99 container of guac was surprisingly large, it didn't last long in our house! The other moms and kiddos agree, El Camps guacamole is one of the best! Another added bonus, chips and their tasty (slightly spicy) salsa are free with take our orders as well!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy or fast food here, just good Mexican food with a great Mexican decor (a tad cheesy but it works). Not to mention, probably the best Margarita's in Monroeville."}
{"text":"Very slow service. I have been to many mexican restaurants and this is the only that charges extra for more chips!! Ordered the fajitas, it was 90% veggies and 10% meat, I didn't like that. The food overall just wasn't the best I had. Ive been to better places with a better atmosphere, friendlier people."}
{"text":"The food was exceptional. Not greasy, and very fresh ingredients. The service staff was polite and very nice. When the waitress wasn't around to refill our drinks, the bus boy was right there to pick up the slack. No complaints. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Service- was decent. Waiter checked in our table often and food was fast to come out and he was able to memorize 5 peoples orders, Nice!!  Food- great food! The rice was awesome. The ground beef tacos were great and so were the ground beef enchiladas. Chips and salsa good too! Came out instantly.  I would defiantly come back. Too bad this is a vacation for me."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow. It was polite though. Food was just so-so, not bad but not worth saying that I have to come back."}
{"text":"I will be the first to admit- I probably enjoy \"americanized\" Mexican food more than authentic so I'm sure previous reviews have validity, but I absolutely love this place. Chips and salsa are always fresh to start, and the churiqueso is a must have when I'm dining in. Chicken quesadilla, steak burrito, tacos de carne asada all have been delicious."}
{"text":"Second time here the best Mexican food in western Pennsylvania. We ordered dinner for two. It enough for four people. Guess what we are having for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"I love El Campesino. I have gone there many times; sometimes just me and my husband, sometimes large groups, and the service has always been A+. The prices are very reasonable, the portions are huge, the food is flavorful, and the Margarita's are strong- you can't ask for anything else."}
{"text":"Not the same to me!  I have been eating at El Camp for over 15 years, but since they relocated to the old Lonestar there seems to be difference. Not just that the service has declined, in which it has do to with the booth set-up, but the food isn't the same. I could be crazy, well yes, I am crazy. But it's just different, can't explain it.   Don't get me wrong, I LOVE me some El Camp, the best Mexican in Monroeville. Just  dosen't live up to the standards now, that i set in my head. If that makes sense.  Jedi Recommended Dishes;  * chile poblano * enchiladas (shred beef or cheese) * fajita quesadilla (large portion) * chorizo & cheese (appetizer)  jedi certified"}
{"text":"I had the fire burrito. It was a good size burrito and the spicy sauce is yummy but the ground beef was not seasoned and very bland. My colleague for the tacos and stated he shredded beef was also bland."}
{"text":"This is my number one choice for Mexican in the immediate area. The service is prompt, the servers are all friendly and helpful, and my drink is never empty. The menu has been pared down in the last few years, which I think has been helpful to the consistency in their service. They also remodeled the Stow location and it now has a much more comfortable atmosphere.  My last visit was on Thursday, 11/13, and my boyfriend and I were seating and quickly given chips and salsa. The chips were really warm and fresh. We ordered drinks - I got water and he got a soda - which were delivered quickly. I ordered a combination with a burrito filled with beef tips and beans, served with guacamole salad, rice, and beans. He ordered the burritos deluxe. Given that we were there 4:30 on a Thursday and there were a fair number of people in the restaurant, our food was brought to the table at lightning speed. Both entrees were fresh and hot, my boyfriend even exclaimed that his burritos were the best he'd had in a long time. The portions were large, but not to an absurd degree. My guacamole was very fresh and flavorful.   This is a pretty standard experience at El Campesino. The menu is pretty solid, the service is prompt, and the food is always good."}
{"text":"A solid 3 star \"A-OK\" Mexican restaurant. I was craving Mexican food after shopping at Robinson Mall, and the Yelp App led me right to El Campesino. Much like everything else on McKnight Rd, it's nestled in a strip mall, and has ample parking. The decor is pretty standard kitschy Mexican restaurant but nothing that turned me off. The service was helpful, prompt and attentive.   I ordered the Hornitos 16oz margarita ($9), and the carnitas dinner ($14). The margarita was tasty: perfect amount of tequila so you don't feel ripped off, and you could tell it wasn't made from bottled margarita mix. The carnitas dinner came with rice, beans, guacamole salad, and tender pork chunks with grilled onions. For me, the carnitas could have been more strongly seasoned and the beans were a little too thick, but the guac had a nice citrus brightness. I mean, it was good, but it didn't wow me. The chips seemed... not stale, but just not light and crispy and fresh. While I loathe chunky salsa, theirs was a little too runny (though the flavor was passable). I was left with the impression that they were maybe gringo-ing everything down a little too much.   Looked like they had some pretty decent drink specials for happy hour and when Pittsburgh teams are playing. If I'm in the area, I would stop by again, but I won't be making a special trip from Sq Hill.  They accept AMEX."}
{"text":"Other el campesinos are better , this was half as good as the rest. Margaritas nothing special, unless you are from Pittsburgh and don't know what good tastes like  This place has horrible bright lighting but is spacious.  They played loud club type of Dominican music which was annoying.  The good reviews on here were from those without true taste for Mexican food. It looks like a strip mall food place.  3 tables of screaming kids says something about the area if you know what I mean  If not for the terrible harsh music I would give a higher rating"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times. Horrible flavorless tomato sauce from a can used as salsa.. No cilantro or fresh jalapeños in  the salsa  Horrible margaritas. Different people made mine and these are not worth drinking. The last bartender put soda water on top to extend the margarita. Sorry, that is not authentic and doesn't cut it.  Maybe pittsburgh has no idea what a genuine margarita tastes like.  Hot tomatillo salsa was better.  This location is not worth visiting and on weekends, way too many families with young kids.   That should tell you something of their quality!  I'm disappointed that they  focus on TV screens with sports on all the time. I prefer Mexican music to blaring loud football stations . The food is bland .    Are the cooks from pittsburgh?   Not a nice place to eat or drink. Margaritas are made from an artificial ingredient mix . Yuk. Fresh lemons and limes are what margaritas are about , not a  fake green mixer.  They need to take Mexican food 101"}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for Mexican food. We've been dining here for years. The servers are super friendly and always accommodating. The food is consistently great and always made fresh.  It gets crowded, but we've never had to wait long - plenty of seating.  The guacamole and cheese dip are delicious. There are 2 other El Campesino restaurants in the area (Twinsburg and Streetsboro), but this one is by far the best."}
{"text":"I ate the worm!  Okay - not really but I did have some good tequila there with some friends.     I went for dinner and enjoyed every bit.   After a couple of beers and some chorizo cheese dip for my nachos - I thought I was complete but then my meal came out.  My meal consisted of a plate full of goodness that had the common Mexican components - Chicken, Tortillas, Cheese, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Sour Cream, Rice, Beans - can you guess what I had?  You are right - I had the soft shell Chicken Chimichanga (who knew)??? I know had just described every Mexican Meal on earth that deals with chicken.   The chicken was the star of the show and tasted really good.  I will go back again.   I hope that If I try everything on the menu they will give me an honorary sombrero and poncho (but that may confuse and scare people)  Atmosphere - It is a mexican restaurant with a good crowd and good food. = GREAT :-)  Food - They do chicken right.   My meal was around $8.   The appetizer cheese dip was $5.   If you are on a budget and want good food - this is the place :-)  Service - My table was pretty silly and our waiter was busy which did not put him in the best humor but he livened up to the end of our meal so I give him high marks (atleast for his patience).  If you want mexican, put on your big poncho and do it.   Just don't eat the worm!"}
{"text":"This place pretty much sucks. I'll be honest... the food was good but the service makes this place a bad bet. The server, with about 7 people in The restaurant came out To our Table three times. After we sat down they took our drinm order. I ordered a beer which took 25 minutes to arrive. We had 6 people at our table and waited 1 hour to order food. Another hour went went by before we started getting our food. Our orders were completely mixed up and incorrect. Like I said the food was pretty good... but not what I ordered. At one point the waiter walked up to the table to double check our order and actually whistled at us to get our attention like we were dogs. The place was empty the servers just sit around and speak Spanish (and point at you) the entire time and the service in general is non existent. We actually had to go to the bar for napkins. All in all this place is dead. For a Friday night... seems like they should be out of business within a month. There are 10 restaurants within a mile or so that are a way better than this. Even the fast food restaurants included..."}
{"text":"food here is okay, not the best... i prefer patron. i think you get more for your money and the quality is better. we were meeting my family there and came in a little, it took me awhile just to get my drink or for the waiter to even notice me.."}
{"text":"I was disappointed that they did not serve fresh salsa or horchata. The prices were a bit high & not worth it."}
{"text":"Nice place and good margaritas but their food is very blend. Not very good."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for lunch because it was convenient while I was visiting family and friends in the area.  We will try another restaurant next time. Not impressed. Food: 3/5. Not bad,  just not exciting. Chips and salsa(which was good) arrived right away. I ordered a lunch fajita with a mix of beef and chicken-It came with beef only and there were mushrooms in the onion and peppers-it made me wonder if the beef had previously been prepared for another dish since mushroom slices are not usually in fajitas in my experience. Also the whole dish was bland without any fajita flavor or sauce.  Other dishes around the table were also said to be not exceptional.  Dishes do come with the usual sides of beans and rice which were felt to be \"average.\" Service:4+/5. Good  Location: 5/5 Conveniently accessible. Plenty of parking Facilities: 4/5 Lots of room, not crowded.  Has a banquet room for large groups. A little tired and mostly clean."}
{"text":"11 dollar weak margaritas seems a little steep. Food was good but definitely not remarkable."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular at this place 3 years ago. Food is excellent tex-mex for Pittsburgh region. I ordered something new from the menu - Enchilada Mexicanas. Deliciously spicy! However, management must have changed as the service is extremely slow (hence one less star). Don't be in a rush, if you decide to come here. Relax and have some margaritas."}
{"text":"Cinco De Mayo..... Hubby and I stopped in for a bite to eat. I will list the pros and cons. We sat in the bar area and they cleaned up a table for us right away. Overall I have had better so if you have high expectations I would not recommend.  Pros: pleasant staff. Accommodating when hubby did not like his food....Enchiladas de Mole and reordered shrimp tacos. Tortillas chips were nice and hot. Salsa flavorful.  Great atmosphere  Cons: No substitutions  No black beans Ordered Cinco de Mayo dinner. Beef tough, chicken dry Rice plain. No corn or onions or anything cooked with it. Shrimp tacos: tiny cheap shrimp. Didn't taste fresh to me. Hubby ate them. Margarita on rocks only and beer as special drink price .  This place has a great Mexican feel. Food quality is low. Food edible but nothing to brag about. I didn't take any food to go, although hubby did. Food felt generic. It would be ok if your hungry."}
{"text":"Fast and attentive staff makes this place always a good choice. With all due respect to purists, the food is American-Mexican inspired, not authentic Mexican cuisine. You've been notified. If you just want delicious, then you'll be happy.   The friendly servers, margaritas and tasty salsa goes a long way for me. Staples ordered are pollo con crema and pollo loco (though I wish Serranos were an option instead of just jalapeños). Muy loco?  Another Yelp rating 3.5 rounded up to 4 due to great service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This is a nice place, but. My friend ordered fried chimichangas and got regular ones. When she said something  the waitress snatched the plate off the table and said it was because they changed the oil so they would not be brown.... when the replacement arrived all of the condiments were piled on top... not cool"}
{"text":"For a more authentic Mexican meal I recommend El Camp. They have lots of good combo lunches and dinners.  Chips and salsa are really good.  Service is friendly and fast.  A good spot for lunch or dinner with friends."}
{"text":"\"El Camps,\" as it's called by my cousin, is my cousin's favorite.  It's where we eat together.  I've been to this location multiple times and have done a tour de France of the menu items. Writing a review it challenging because this place doesn't stand out from your average mexican place.  It's all good food and quality service.  I will have to say that they serve a shredded chicken soup that is a must!!  I've posted a pic.  I'll keep coming back to eat here with my cousin and will definitely get the shredded chicken soup again."}
{"text":"Very good food overall,,nice atmosphere,, some times better the other times,,  I and my wife like them.. Our friends love the one in Monroeville pa."}
{"text":"Let me first say, that the food and service here are not bad, but this is not real Mexican food.  Again, for what you're going to find around Pittsburgh, this isn't bad, but this is highly Americanized Mexican food.  Last time we were there the chips were stale, and they don't have Horchata or Jamica."}
{"text":"Excellent food, decent prices and a mariachi band... Need I say more?"}
{"text":"The waiter was nice. The menu had many choices. I liked my carne asada. My chicken quesadilla had a good taste but also much liquid dripping out. I liked the chips and puréed salsa. Prices were reasonable. Bathrooms were clean. The parking lot had many available spaces."}
{"text":"Standard Mexican food, just like they have all over the area.  But El Campesino is a little better tasting than most.  Pretty much all I get is the El Campesino Fajitas which are steak, chicken, and shrimp.  They taste great with enough left to have a few more at home.  Margaritas are good.  A regular size is big enough for me, but they need more ice in them.  Overall one of the best Mexican places in the area."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. It isn't fancy but is reliable basic Tex-mex. service is usually pretty quick and we never leave hungry."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere but the food is not that great.  The restaurant is in a plaza and doesn't look like much on the outside.  Inside it appears you walked into a sterotypical Mexican restaurant.  It has alot of bright colors around with Mexican type decor.  The tables are very private.  The service was great, polite waiters and things were served timely.  The waiter also kept my drink full, which is about all you half to do to make me happy!  They do provide chips and salsa as soon as you sit down.  For me, this was the best part of the meal.  They have great salsa and the chips are light and crunchy!  I got 2 enchiladas and a taco.  They were all beef and there was no spice to the beef at all.  It tasted just like fried ground meat.  I could have made them better at home.  I realize that not all Mexican food is meant to be spicy but it should have some type of flavor to it.  My meal came with rice which was pretty good.  The rice was soft but not chewy!  The price is pretty good as well, $8 for lunch.  If you want a quick edible meal this is the place.  i probably will not go back anytime soon.    They do have Happy Hour specials - maybe they make better margaritas!"}
{"text":"Tarda mucho la comida el servicio estuvo lento la comida nada fuera de lo normal pero les doy la segunda oportunidad"}
{"text":"When we want Mexican, this is usually our choice.  If the rating was based on food alone, it would be higher.  But unfortunately, service can be lacking.    El Campesino is the typical Americanized Mexican restaurant.  The menu is several pages long with a variety of tacos, enchiladas and various dinner options.  Most are available in combos or entrees where you can choose multiple options (for example, three varieties of enchiladas).  My favorite item is a chicken breast with Chorizo, jalepanos and cheese sauce.  So tasty!  I have also tried their enchiladas and also found them enjoyable.  I have had efficient service, but I have also had non existent service.  The last time we were in it took about 10 minutes before a server came over.  Then he forgot we had ordered the queso.  And managed to get our pretty simple order wrong.  Other times the servers felt like they were watching you eat.  And there were times when it was a completely pleasant dining experience.    Make sure you check the local publications and their website for coupons as they often have offers for 10% off.  Overall, not bad for \"fast food\" type Mexican."}
{"text":"everything is the 1980's style tex mex over saucy food with bland ingredients, more like a taco bell than a real restaurant and why would the bartender keep griping about trump? come on... like i came here for your opinion"}
{"text":"My friend and I grabbed dinner here and were probably the two most indecisive people in there. We could not decide what we wanted or what was good. The waiter Andres  suggested  we got a meal that fit exactly what we were looking for. He was so friendly and courteous to us, we even enjoyed a few laughs. Needles to say this experience was a pleasant one. I can't wait to go back and  try something else!"}
{"text":"Bad customer service!  The server forgot my order and brought me what he thought I asked.  I forgiven the first mistake but he did it three times.  Unacceptable!!!and the food was not the big deal at all!"}
{"text":"Very good! After reading the reviews on Yelp we decided to try this restaurant. Was not disappointed! Service was good and the food was wonderful. The salsa they give you with the chips was really good. I had chicken fajitas a d hubby had shrimp tacos and we both enjoyed our meals. We will back!"}
{"text":"Great Food , Excellent staff & Cooks. The only negative that I could think of were the screaming children at the next table. I guess this is not the fault of the management , It's more the fault of the MORON parents who thought it was a better idea to text on their I-Phones, than to tend to the nightmare children. The poor waiter had to clean up a mess that I'm sure a dozen PIG's couldn't create.  I'll be back , But next time I'll be more careful where I sit."}
{"text":"First time here, food okay. I would comment on service but we didn't get any. I don't think our waiter said 2 words to us, except no to a question. We wouldn't go back to many other places to try. No wonder it was empty?"}
{"text":"I worked here as a bartender a few years ago. Despite how negative the experience was for me, the food is good and their kitchen is very clean. The same cooks are basically there every night and really know what they are doing. However, they go through bartenders like paper napkins. The girl who trained me quit a week later after being sexually assaulted. Really that should have been a warning sign for me. The drinks were fun to make and the margaritas are huuuge. The way the staff members treated me though was just unacceptable. As an example, one time the dishwasher came in and turned off the light when I was in the walk in and I had to swear at him to leave in spanish.  So, go and enjoy the food, but please tip your (probably suffering) bartender."}
{"text":"I used to absolutely love this restaurant many years ago. It has gone downhill. The quality of food is not what it used to be. After living in Texas for 2 years, there really aren't any Mexican or Tex mex places around that live up to the food there!!! The owners of El Campesino should take a trip to Houston, TX and visit Lupe Tortilla! Take some notes and bring that food here, especially their fajitas with the homemade tortillas!!I guarantee business would boom because there aren't any mexican restaurants like that in the area!!"}
{"text":"Good service at lunch time. Went with the dinner menu & it was very good. Rice was delicious and portions were extremely generous. Free chips & salsa kept coming. The good margaritas were priced a little steep but they were \"gooooood\"!"}
{"text":"If the last thing I saw had been the first thing I saw, I would've walked out & ate elsewhere.  My wife & I had a very good meal. I had the Pollo Mexicana. Very good. After we had eaten, I excused myself to use the rest room. The men's room was filthy.  I will eat at El Campesina again, but not that one."}
{"text":"many people said that this was the best place in pittsburgh for mexican food. halves of taco shells as chips? A chile relleno that had more cheese than chile? A taco with taco bell type meat? jesus. the mexicans who work here are laughing at us, i assure you."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've ever had. They have a TON of options and a great atmosphere! Prices are reasonable and portions are huge."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour with a group. Things started out well, drinks were flowing and everyone was having a good time. Food was ok by standards. Once the bill came things got sideways. We had asked several times about HH pricing and what qualifies and what doesn't. The bill came without any HH discounts - once we inquired the manager advised that the \"large\" drinks we ordered had not qualified for HH pricing - we asked for the manager to review and were offered no concession for an error that was obviously not ours. What a shame that the manager wouldn't/couldn't correct a pretty easy situation to resolve. Can't say I would be back anytime soon. Positive note I hear the place next door STOKES is awesome!   Update - manager offered gift card once I went and asked to talk to him."}
{"text":"The best & most authentic food around!  The staff is great and the $ is right!  Try the Chimichangas and wash it down with an imported bottle of \"Sol\" beer!  Yum!!  Quite simply HAS TO BE the best Mexican place around!! The staff is very friendly; The food is amazing; The portions are huuuge; The menu is insanely large!  Overall, A-W-E-S-O-M-E!   :)   Menu Suggestions: Queso Blanco (\"White Cheese Dip\", they'll know what you mean) order this when they give you your chips/salsa   ;)  Chicken or Beef Chimichangas Flautas (chicken or beef) Shredded Beef Quesadillas Fajitas Campesinas  Beer:  Sol (very good)"}
{"text":"For Mexican food and staff this place is top notch. Any seafood dish is fresh. Today I just had the worst service there. The guacamole was not fresh and the server made it feel like we were being an inconvenience."}
{"text":"While living in NYC for three years, I'd become someone of a cynic when it came to eating out.  I didn't expect to see good deals with good food ever again in my lifetime because of how eye opening of an expensive experience I'd had in the Big Apple.  That is, until I went to El Campesino.  There are some disclaimers I'd like to point out before I go any further:  I had a coupon, I'm a tough food critic, and mexican food is my favorite cuisine.  My family was promptly seated in the back dining room.  It was surprisingly quite crowded, which was a good sign.  The minute we sat down there were fresh chips and salsa at our table.  Both are unlimited and the portions were larger than any I'd seen anywhere else.  This salsa was like CRACK.  Because our coupon made us spend at least $40, we ordered 3 entrees, a kids meal, and guac.  The guacamole (another huge portion for FOUR DOLLARS) was delicious, smooth, and fresh.  I got the fajitas which came out piping hot and juicy.  My sister and brother in law got the steak/shrimp/veggie quesadillas and taco salad, respectively.  The quesadillas were delicious, the shrimp was very tasty and seasoned to perfection, and the taco salad looked small, but ended up being a ton of food.    Everything was brought to us piping hot, fresh, quick, and with a smile.  There was no way this food had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours, and if it was, they had us fooled.  The waitstaff was very nice and accomodating.  When we finished our dinner, we were $3 short of spending the $40, so we got caramel flavored fried ice cream.  It was some of the best dessert I'd ever eaten!  I would give this place 4 stars because they make you choose between rice OR beans, which given the portion sizes, I find silly that they are so nit-picky.  However, when I ordered both, I wasn't charged extra, so 5 stars it is!  We went because of a coupon, but I'd go back any day with no discount.  It's THAT good.  I never thought I'd be so glad to be out of NYC."}
{"text":"Great little Mexican joint..... One the best chips and salsa i had in a wile...so watery and spicy. Had a taco chicken fajitas salat.....MMMmmmm......delicious! Everything tasted so fresh and its a decent portion. 4 stars only because my server forgot about me for like......forever"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding!    It's location is a bit out of the way so many people don't know about it though."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good.  Used to visit this restaurant a couple of times per month.  They have a very large dining room, really good enchiladas, and it's very affordable.   Honestly, I wish half stars were an option because they deserve 4.5. This is the second best Mexican restaurant around."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican I have found so far!  I've been a local here since early 2000's and this was the first suggestion we received on good restaurants in the area. One of the first restaurants we went to when we first moved here, actually. I've never found any better Mexican restaurant since. Authentic.  I may know the menu by heart by now, but I've gotten everything from the enchiladas to the taco salads to the steak burritos. The queso dip is to die for (of course it is, we will never know how these Mexican restaurants perfect these cheese dips). My favorite is the quesadilla, I get it with either shredded chicken or shredded beef. It comes with so much cheese inside that is hard for me to resist (I'm a huge cheese lover). If you like spicy-there's a queso dip appetizer with chorizo I believe, and it's good if you want that extra kick with some of that amazing cheese that we all know so well. The guacamole is great every time I've ordered it too, fresh and never seems to have been sitting out for a period of time or anything of that nature. Your food comes out so fast that you swear you ordered not even five minutes ago. The staff is always very prompt and friendly. If you're not in the sit-down type of mood, they have a great take-out option, because they will whip up your order FAST. I like to call and order take-out on Friday nights and pick it up on my way home. It's a perfect take-out option for stay-in movie nights on Fridays. They also give you salsa and chips to-go with your order, which is nice, and will give you as many bags of chips and extra salsa if you ask them.   One of my favorites, and probably always will be. It's been in this city for so long that it just feels like home, as I'm sure it does for many other locals here."}
{"text":"Upfront: I'm a total jerk about Mexican food, in spite of the fact that I've never lived in Mexico, or even CA or AZ or really anywhere that gives me any cred at all. That said, my idea of decent gringo-ized Mexican food was formed in areas with large Mexican populations, and maybe Christmas tamales from kitchen coworkers.  As much as I love Pittsburgh, we've got a serious shortage of edible Mexican/Mexamerican/Tex-Mex going on. El Campesino is decent, and probably one of the better options if you're looking for fajitas or a combo plate in the Steel City.  For starters, they have the ubiquitous chips and salsa; the chips are almost always fresh, and the salsa's decent though made with canned tomatoes every time I've gone, even in late summer. Not a lot of kick, but at least there's cilantro involved.  Queso dip is OK, too, and yes -- it's white cheese, heaven forfend, so not quite the same as Velveeta + salsa in the crockpot or Chi-Chi's queso.  Their mole is decent. Nothing to write home about, but good for a fix if you don't feel like spending twelve hours with your stock pot and blender.  Enchiladas are also decent, as are the burritos, fajitas, etc. The refritos are fairly generic, and as far as I'm concerned the rice isn't worth eating, but I might be picky.  Chile verde is probably the best thing I've eaten there; tart, savory, pork-fatty and corn tortillas? Yes, please.  Guacamole is pretty seriously meh; it tastes a bit like citric acid and nothing at all like someone smashed it up fresh in the back. Still, it's avocado, and with the Iggle charging 2.50 per for Haas, it'll do.  They do have horchata if you ask, which scores a lot of bonus points in my book. I just wish the flour tortillas didn't taste like they came from a plastic bag. Maybe I'm ordering the wrong things, but I think on the whole that the bar for Mexican, \"Mexican,\" whatever, is pretty low in the 'burgh. So clearing said bar by a good margin doesn't mean a whole lot, right? Then again, it's unfair of me to wish it were a 24-hour taqueria.  Service is fast and friendly. The atmosphere (on McKnight) is standard for this type of Mexican restaurant: A bit dark, lots of booths, reasonably quiet until someone has too much tequila."}
{"text":"For Pittsburgh, this is not too bad if a place. Now, if you're from the south or southwest, forget trying to find authentic Mexican or texmex on pittsurgh or in the surrounding area because it just doesn't exist, no matter what any Pittsburgh yelper says. On the plus side: food was served fairly quickly, were made with the correct ingredients and had jalapenos (unlike most of the so-called \"mexican\" restaurants around here. Service was nice, average, polite...always nice qualities to have in service.  On the down-side, like I said, this doesn't even come close to the rich flavors of true Mexican food as I'm pretty sure they'd go under if they did flavor it up because Pittsburgh palets tend to be quite sensitive to bold flavors. Flan was ok but missed the mark with the sauce..could have been bolder with the sweetness. Lastly, they close at 10:30pm on a Friday. Sadly, pittburgh's demographics (average age, 55) means almost nothing stays open past 9 or 10.  I would love to see this place stay open till 2 or 3. Would be a great place to grab a late bite or hang after the clubs shut down, but, then again..average age of 55 also means bedtime by 9. Oh well, what are you gonna do...it's Pittsburgh. I'd still recommend this place as one of the best that you can find in the greater Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Great every time. Polite and prompt service, excellent food, fair prices. Far and away the best Mexican I've ever had."}
{"text":"Yum!!  We ordered the seafood enchiladas, which were on special. They were delicious. Came with rice.   The chips and salsa are fresh.   The staff was friendly.   We will eat here again."}
{"text":"I am so happy that I remembered about this restaurant.  Nestled in a non-descript strip mall in front of Home Depot, it is easy to just overlook this little gem.  It has all the tchotchky associated with your typical Mexican restaurant, but with some more authentic nods to their ancestry in the form of some original paintings.  Entering into the restaurant, you will notice that the dining area is L-shaped with the small leg being the bar seating and the long leg being the traditional dining area -- both sections separated by the Host's stand.    We were seated in one of the many booths that lined the wall and began to review what we wanted.  All of the servers speak English, and they make an effort to speak it but you can see that it is still somewhat difficult for them -- every now and then I would slip in some Spanish when I would see that \"What?!?\" look pop up on their face.  Seeing the cheese dip on the menu, we ordered that with flour tortillas when we ordered our drinks.  The drinks, chips and salsa, and the cheese sauce came out immediately.  HOORAY!  The cheese was WHITE!  It wasn't yellow or stringy like the cheese sauce I have received at so many Mexican restaurants I have been to recently.  THANK YOU!  We placed our order for the rest of our meal:  Chicken soup (no pico de gallo) Steak burrito with different sauce sides Steak burrito with salsa de queso Chicken quesadilla  The chips were thin, crisp and warm.  The salsa had flavor, and a good consistancy but lacked any piquancy.  The combination was wonderful in my mouth.  Adding the supple cheese sauce to my palate only made me want more.  The cheese sauce was light and saucy -- not too watery or too thick -- and had a touch of piquancy and an additional layer of flavor beyond the cheese.  As I gorged myself on the chips and cheese, the soup arrived.  I tried some but was not too fond of it.  I went back to my cheese dip.  The soup arrived and again my attention was diverted from the cheese dip.  The soup had a decent flavor to it: chicken, chicken broth, vegetables.  And it did not have that sodium laden taste that most soups have acquired over the years.    I finally decided that if I ate too many of the chips, that I wouldn't be able to finish my meal; so I left one or two chips in the basket and waited for the rest of the food to arrive.  Our quesadilla arrived with the burritos.  I was eyeing my burrito with a passion.  I had asked for several different sides of sauce to compare: green mole, red mole, and tomatillo sauce.  This, for me, is the true test of authenticity of a Mexican restaurant -- can they make a good Mexican sauce/mole.  I didn't really care for the red mole -- no surprise there, but I figured I would give it a try.  The green mole and the tomatillo sauce were both good.  The green mole was a bit thick and had a bit of a bitter flavor to it.  It was a mild mole.  The tomatillo sauce was also mild but was more tangy/acidic than it was bitter.  I truly enjoyed the sauces due to their flavor.  I experimented and mixed the two into different versions and found that different ratios only improved the flavor -- in my mind.  The steak in the burrito wasn't rubbery and had good flavor.  Add in the green sauces and I was in heaven.  I ate only half the burrito -- darn chip and cheese indulgence.   I did manage to try some of the quesadilla.  It is fairly basic in its composition: cheese, tortilla, chicken.  This is GOOD.  The flavors, while basic, were quite good -- especially with the addition of a little of their fresh-made salsa.    I am happy to have found this restaurant and will continue to return!"}
{"text":"Maybe I wasn't hungry enough, maybe my expectations were too high based on the reviews, maybe I ordered the wrong thing or maybe this place is just \"A-OK\" when it comes to Mexican food.  I've been on a vegetarian/vegan kick lately so I got a combination platter under the \"Vegetarian\" options.  My entree came with one cheese enchilada, chile poblano, mexican rice and re-fried beans.    I wasn't blown away by any of the items but they were decent.  I got most of it \"to go\" since like I mentioned I realized I wasn't overly hungry.  But when I ate the left overs the next day I still felt underwhelmed by the meal.  I am happy to report that the chile poblano had a bit of heat as well as the chips and salsa that they served complimentary with your meal.    Next time I might check out a meat dish because maybe that's where I went wrong?!?!"}
{"text":"We always enjoy coming to El Campesino when in the mood for some good Mexican food! The food is consistently good; the nachos supreme is a meal in itself! We have tried a lot of different dishes here and never been disappointed. The only reason I gave 4 and not 5 stars is because, while the service is a least friendly, they always seem rushed. Food comes out at a good pace but I feel like they're always overwhelmed. And they're stingy with their napkins; it's hard to get extra!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go because they'll allow large (and noisy) groups without problem. Decent quality food and drinks - you won't go away saying it was the best Mexican food you've ever had but you also won't leave dissatisfied or hungry. Solid choice for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great services especially at the bar. Travel the area a lot and one of the best places if your stuck in Robinson"}
{"text":"Great drinks. So-so food. The chicken dishes are definitely your best bet. Really nice view from the patio. Über-friendly servers. Go for drinks on a nice relaxing Friday evening if you really want to enjoy yourself here."}
{"text":"We arrived here about 45 mins  before they were closing. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Food was good & SO ARE THE MARGARITAS!  :)"}
{"text":"The exterior is bright and inviting, the interior is slick, maybe too much. Warm chips and salsa with a nice, spicy tang went nice with a Cadillac Margarita as I checked the menu.   I had the Chile Verde. Chunks of pork and onions served with rice, refried beans and green sauce. The pork was tender and surprisingly spicy - juicy and flavorful. Rice and beans a cut above.   Atmosphere is strip mall chic with modern lines and designs taking precedent over the traditional decor. Good mix of Mexican tunes over the speakers, good service, sort of on the high side if you're ordering specials versus combo plates.  Well worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Terrible \"Mexican\" food. The only thing remotely Mexican in the place were the signs for imported beer.  The food was like a blind Italian grandma would have made based on a description someone gave her of a picture they once saw in a magazine. Anything that says it has \"cheese\" means terrible white American cheese quesso sauce. The flavor of everything could best be described as 'meh'. No notable flavors, nothing distinct or memorable (in a good way at least).   The service was the bare minimum of okay.  Our waitress took our order and brought out the right food without saying anything offensive. But she couldn't answer basic questions about the menu, never refilled our drinks and made us walk up to the entrance to pay.  Next time I want Mexican, I'll go to Casa Reyna or Chicken Latino in the Strip, maybe the taco stand outside Las Palmas grocery in Brookline.   To all you ancient  fat, white yinzers here in Pittsburgh that continue to pay for god awful butcheries of authentic ethnic food, please hurry up and move to Florida."}
{"text":"I was here for the first time in years not long ago and had a poor experience.    The service was really slow and the food was relatively bland.  We had gone through 2 rounds of drinks and ALOT of chips and salsa as we waited.   When I got my tacos the meat was poorly seasoned and bland....and it's MEXICAN food, don't be afraid to use some flavor in it.     In fact the Qdoba and Chipolte up the street are even better as fast food options for Mexican.          The Emiliano's up the street is no longer open at the McKnight location but their other locations are also fantastic."}
{"text":"Service was slow on this trip in... food was good. Took over 10 minutes for anyone to greet us let alone seat us and then another 10 minutes to have anyone come take even our drink order. Once we got someone to come to our table the service was decent."}
{"text":"After hearing good things my wife and I stopped in yesterday. The salsa and chips were better than most American Mexican places. The shrimp tacos were excellent. Good flavor, nice balance of heat and flavor.   Service was attentive and yet not bothersome. Pricing was a little higher than some other places but was competitive for what you get in terms of portions and flavor. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"The salsa was so delicious. Wasn't too impressed with the guacamole, it was pretty bland. However, the food was great. Got a taco salad and it was delicious. The waiter was very friendly, but he was the only one working so they were understaffed and we had to wait a long time to get our check."}
{"text":"Loved the great service! Loved my dinner. And loved the best Pico de galo I have ever had. Will return ASAP."}
{"text":"I am baffled at how this place has such a high rating. The food was horrendous and could barely pass for dog food, let alone authentic Mexican. The place was also extremely dirty and dusty. We will never be going back there. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"We had probably the worst service I have ever experienced in my life.   We waited for service for I want to say at least 20 minutes before anyone even came to our table. The guy said nobody knew we were there? What?   The queso dip we started with was almost impossible to eat because it was so watery (and tasteless) as was the salsa!   The chicken flautas came without queso and when asked our server about this (which I thought was the standard?) he suggested to just use the queso dip we already had? What in the world? Due to the lack of service we were there entirely too long, and I felt like each employee was staring daggers at us! Oh, also, the bathrooms are disgusting. For the same kind of food/price go down the road to Rey Azteca...it's so much better!   While the food was subpar in my opinion, it was the service that really made this one of the worst experiences ever."}
{"text":"This is my favorite go to restaurant. My family and I eat here 1-2 times per week. Usually we order take out from here but on special occasions we eat at the location. For every birthday we come here. We love it when they sing us happy birthday in Spanish. The atmosphere is wonderful. Nice music and good decor.   The food is alway delicious. We've never had a bad experience. I tend to stick with the classic bean burrito and it's perfect every time. My husband loves the fire burrito and quesadilla supreme. Even my ten year old enjoys his food. The chips and salsa are a huge hit and they give a huge amount. The salsa is perfectly spicy! Prices are very good and they offer coupons in the local flyer."}
{"text":"Yummy! This was my Friday lunch destination several weeks ago, and overall, I had a descent experience. Pros -- Food was tasty and authentic and delivered quickly to the table. The staff was polite and helpful. Cons -- The restaurant is older and a little worn, including my booth's bench that was a bit cracked. My margarita - with salt on the rim - was very disappointing. In retrospect, I should have sent it back. A good portion of salt must have fallen in the actual beverage and had the flavor of salty ocean water. No bueno!"}
{"text":"So seeing the manager talk about the restaurant is this authentic Mexican food because she isn't!"}
{"text":"Best place for Mexican food around. Peak hours during the weekends are usually busy but never a long wait. Servers are always fast and are always checking on drink refills. Free chips and salsa is also a perk! Best thing is the food comes out super fast, never have to wait long to get your meal."}
{"text":"We came at lunch time. We were seated quickly.  Our waiter was attentive and pleasant. Food came fast. Chips are typical. Cheese dip and salsa are yummy. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to really \"rave\" about either.  Bathrooms were EXTRA clean, though."}
{"text":"Ahh, Pittsburgh.....flavor central. Not fucking really. Now, I hail from Ohio, which is the king of non authentic Mexican food (next to Texas, of course). I got ground beef enchiladas, which to be nice, were unimpressive. Never have I HAD to put hot sauce on something for flavor. This would be a one star venture, but the service was super quick, and that should at least get a star. Are you bored with this review yet? Yeah, that's how I felt eating there. Mission accomplished, lol."}
{"text":"Long ago, when I lived in Monroeville, my father and I would frequent El Campesino's first location. It was before their big dreams of total Mexican dominance of the Pittsburgh restaurant market, and we felt like we were in on a secret that we only told friends and family about. The food was delicious, authentic, and the waitstaff barely spoke English, thus adding to the genuine ambiance despite the fact that except for a few sombreros and maps of Mexico on the walls, it looked like a hole in the wall diner. Then one day, we went there to eat and a big sign on the door said they were temporarily closed. Oh no, where would I get my chile rellenos fix?? What happened??? The urban legend goes that a van was pulled over in Texas, and upon searching the van, the authorities found it full of illegal immigrants who said they were going to Pittsburgh for El Campesino's. While I don't know if this story is true, it only added to the mystique of the restaurant when it reopened two weeks later.  Flash-forward to 2012, and in my opinion, El Campesino's is Pittsburgh's best Mexican restaurant. Despite having 7 locations, each restaurant seems pretty consistent when it comes to food taste and quality. At the Robinson location, the restaurant is a bright rainbow dream of turquoise, greens, and earth tones with large wood booths, Mexican chotskys on the wall, and a bar area with TVs. The food is still genuine Mexican, and the menu is filled with burritos, enchiladas, tacos, nachos, chile rellenos, chile poblanos, fajitas, and lots more. My personal favorite item on the menu is their chile rellenos, which unlike the battered and fried version you normally see, is a stuffed pepper with ground beef and creamy cheese sauce. In fact, their cheese is so good, that they could put it on anything and I'd eat it- yum. If you're really hungry, go for the Special Combination, which for $13 will comes with four plates of food- tacos, burritos, enchiladas, beans, rice, and more. I like the price point of their combination platters- I think there's like 20 different versions. If you're looking for meals, I like the Chicken Mole- you can get it in an enchilada or just chicken with Mole sauce, My new favorite is the Cincho de Mayo, which is chicken and beef on a sizzling plate with spring onions and peppers. It comes with rice and beans, tortilla, and a fired taco shell bowl filled with guacamole. At $13, it tastes awesome, is a ton of food, and I like to think of it as sticking it to the man since it's basically a fajita plate without the $17 price. After all these years, El Campesino's is still my favorite Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh, and it's very cool to how far they've come from their first small location to a restaurant empire."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's such a cute go-to when you're craving Mexican food in the area. It has such a friendly staff and they're always so quick! The fresh chips and House-made salsa is always waiting for us as soon as we sit down! Also, their salsa is delicious! It's not as chunky and has sort of a lime hint to it - it's just so original.  I typically order the shrimp fajitas (I believe) and it comes with all the fix-ins on a sizzling dish of cheese - veggies, refried beans, lettuce, shrimp (obviously) and a handful of warm and fresh tortillas. Now, I'm not a bean person whatsoever, but I could eat an entire plate of El Camp's refried beans! They're more on the sweet side and don't have a weird texture!  This time around, I was craving a smothered burrito and boy, did I make a great choice! I ordered the Burritos Tipicos, which is 2 burritos in a warm torilla with shredded beef, refried beans (YAS), topped with lettuce and guacamole (no, it's no extra here!), swimming in a puddle of nacho cheese (not the kind you buy from the grocery store, I promise). LISTEN, it sounds like a mess, but it'll go above and beyond your expectations. And most importantly, the food is not pricey for what you get. Two burritos are about $10, while fajitas and other dishes are closer to $15-$20. But again, they make sure you get your moneys worth!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by El Campesino! I came for a late lunch and really enjoyed it. If you like Mexican food, you'll like El Campesino. Its a strip small secret in Twinsburg that has delicious food.  For starters, the menu is gigantic. Soooo many options! The prices are also super reasonable. We decided to try the chicken mole enchiladas as a starter, and wow, it could have been my whole lunch. The mole sauce had a great, sweet flavor and the enchiladas were super hearty with shredded chicken. I also had a house made sangria. It was what I expected, but I wish it would have come with a lime or a piece of fruit.  For lunch, I had the carnitas, and they were tender and juicy. It came with fresh guacamole salad, onions, rice, beans, and tortilla. All the ingredients were very fresh and colorful. The plate was literally put on the table piping hot! The service was so quick that we were genuinely surprised. We had food overload on the table, but everything was too good, so we didn't feel THAT bad. My Mom had the carne asada. I stole a bite, and the steak was nicely prepared, the seasoning was spot-on and the onions were cooked just right. Overall, the food was exactly what I was craving, even though I felt like I needed a nap afterward! El Campesino made excellent leftovers. I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Anyone who gives this place a bad review is crazy. Consistently delicious food, fast service, and friendly environment."}
{"text":"After a recent renovation, the atmosphere here has gone distinctly downhill. The food and service are still good, but the vibe is less date night and more fire hall."}
{"text":"Yuck! My kids(nor I) would eat the beef tacos...the taco salad was horrible! Have tried this place twice and both times bad...don't waste your time (or money)"}
{"text":"I've tried this place three times, and I have never had a satisfactory time. The first time the staff was rude and forgot about us. The second time our food took an hour, our waiter yelled at us for him mishearing us, and there was a hair in our food that the waiter did nothing about. This recent time we had the same waiter as last time who was clearly intoxicated. He went to get our drinks and another waiter came to take over. We were a little confused because our waiter was getting our drinks and no one really said anything about the new guy being our waiter. He walked away to get us salsa and chips and the old waiter dropped our drinks off and never returned. Our food came out efficiently, but my boyfriend ordered a fajita quesadilla that was just fajita veggies and chicken in a folded half tortilla. There was no cheese at all and the tortilla wasn't even grilled. We asked our waiter why it didn't have cheese and he said it didn't come with it. How does a quesadilla not come with cheese?! It can't stick together. It's just an unwrapped fajita. We asked if he could put cheese on it and he instead brought us a bowl of cold shredded cheese and when we said we wanted it grilled he said \"sorry man\" and did nothing more. It's pretty expensive and ok at best and every time there's something wrong. We won't be returning. Patron definitely has won this battle."}
{"text":"This place is a great argument against electing Donald Trump as President of the United States, imagine a Tex-Mex resturant that can ruin something simple as salsa, or even meat and cheese in fried dough.  We need more immigrants in Pittsburgh, iPRONTO!  This place looks like most Tex Mexes you've seen throughout the State. The decor suggests the familar decent but not great fare you typically find at such eateries.  El Campesino is in a word: garbage.  The salsa is watered down tomato sauce with an piece of chopped onion or two. Everything we had off the menu was just unappetizing. We eneded up leaving most of our food uneaten and finished up at Taco Bell.  Bland, bland, bland. Nothing had flavor. Nor the salsa. Not the Chimichunga. Not the Carnitas. I don't think I've ever found carnitas that I was willing to leave behind sitting on a plate.  No one should ever go here. This place takes like Chi-Chis from 1988. Really, can anything worse be said?"}
{"text":"Portion size is small for the money  Salsa and chips were not fresh but the reason for one star was the service was absolutely terrible our waiter stayed in the bar on his phone we had to go in and ask him to get us some more water and the place was empty"}
{"text":"Service was great, but everything was too salty and there were barely any vegetables with too much meat. Did not feel like it was real food."}
{"text":"Great food fast service but up charges for items is ridiculous. Order a combo plate included a cheese enchilada. Asked for onion with the cheese. Check came and there was a $1.50 charge for onion. Mexican food is dirt cheap to make, to charge $1.50 for adding onion to one item  despicable. Needless to say NEVER again."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic but it's the service that sets this place apart. Bring your family and your friends and enjoy an amazing experience !"}
{"text":"Server could have cared less about serving our meal.  10 minutes each time just to bring expected items like water.  Talking to friends while we waited.  Not busy either 5 tables two servers."}
{"text":"Generally efficient service, friendly wait-staff.  That said, the food is okay (mediocre at best).  Nothing particularly delicious, savory or remarkable.  Decent for the price--but not worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"Excellent. Nice clean Mexican decore. Staff is very friendly. Food is very good, not anything out of this world but very good. Good fresh ingredients, 3 chicken  tacos for $5.50, can't beat it! Heck Taco Bell costs more and it's blahhh. I'm giving 5 stars for this overall value. Good food, great staff, clean place and very affordable! I will definately be back. If you are in the area, definately check it out."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. It's not my favorite Mexican restaurant, but it's solid and is a more authentic style of Mexican. I usually get their chicken mole and it's very tasty along with their chile rellenos. Their salsa is thin, but in no way it tastes like spaghetti sauce, it does have a hint of oregano though. I'm not a huge fan of the standards, the burritos, enchiladas and such, they are a little bland and they don't taste like tex-mex that most people are used to eating. If you branch out from those things, you'll get a tasty meal."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go. Large dinning  room and the food and service are great.  Typical  Mexican food done well."}
{"text":"This is the best tex mex chain in the area.  The food is awesome and the prices are very reasonable.  The waitstaff at this location are a hit or miss.  One time I even got up and left after our waiter disappeared.    I just love the burritos though and will go back."}
{"text":"This is the best tex mex chain in the area.  The food is awesome and the prices are very reasonable.  The waitstaff at this location are prompt and have never messed up an order.  Seldom, if ever crowded.  I just love the burritos."}
{"text":"We had the dinner for 2 fajita style. Husband wasn't fond of, I thought it was very good.   The service is always average, never great   We continue to go back.   One of the best, reasonably priced, Mexican food   Oh yeah. Do not order  a ______ and tonic. They arrive  in a glass not much bigger than a sampler"}
{"text":"I have been to el campasino location in Monroeville numerous time and it is one if my favorite Mexican restaurants. This location did not disappoint. The appearance and decor here seems a little newer than monroeville but the space seems smaller with less seating. The staff has always been helpful and friendly.   As you so at many Mexican restaurants, you get free and endless tortilla chips and salsa. The chips are always hot and fresh. I recommend the Queso cheese dip in addition to the salsa. It is extra but worth it!  I always go with one of the vegetarian options but he husband always gets a burrito and we are always happy with our meals. The food is always piping hot and served quickly. I highly recommend  a frozen raspberry margarita or the Coronarita (corona upside down in a margarita!).  I will always come back to el campasino!"}
{"text":"I love El camp for mexican food. We have been here numerous times and have always have good food. Decor is somewhat cheesy as you find in most casual Mexican restaurants. Generally the staff is very friendly here although we did once have a waiter who was not friendly and didn't provide good service. I don't remember his name, but if you get him, you'll know. The food is always served quickly and is always piping hot. Everyone gets free unlimited tortilla chips and salsa. I also recommend ordering the queso dip although it does cost more. I always get one of the vegetarian options and they are all good. I also recommend getting a frozen margarita! Raspberry is my favorite!"}
{"text":"THE Best Mexican restaurant in town.  I used to live in Denver.  Denver is full of authentic Mexican cuisine, so I acquired a more discerning taste for Mexican food.  Pittsburgh is decidedly less \"ethnic\" so I was concerned that I would not be able to get one of my favorite things in the world, mexican food.  El Camp came through.  It reminds me of the best places in Denver and is every bit as good.  Its making my mouth water right now just thinking about it."}
{"text":"I love El Campesino's food.  I swear they put drugs in their chicken as it's just that good and makes you just that happy.  The problem is their service is very unreliable.  They have one server for 10 tables.  If they hired a couple more employees, it place would be five stars."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I'm pretty sure I was meant to be born Mexican considering how much I love Mexican food. El Campesino is always a sure thing. The staff is so friendly we feel comfortable going more than we should because there's no judgement - only smiles of recognition. Large portions which I like because then I have leftovers for the next day and the drinks are always on point. Great spot if you want good service, good food and a full belly."}
{"text":"I am a weekly (or several times a week) visitor to El Camp, great prices, good food, and fast service. The employees treat us as family, and we love it here."}
{"text":"I came here for pick up to go order the Chicken Lunch Fajitas and was charged $ 7.97 for the meal,  I looked the next day and they charged me $ 11.98.  I never tipped or put a tip on the receipt since I was picking up.  Sometimes I would tip a $1 for pick up here but this time I just signed my name and left.  THEY CLEARLY STOLE MONEY FROM me and put in a TIP and added the numbers to the Receipt.  I trusted this place and they stole my $$$$$$ !!!!     VERY SHADY STAY AWAY   store wrote in about a 50 % TIP on Chicken Fajtas -   TERRIBLE BUSINESS PRACTICES"}
{"text":"Service was good.  As soon as we were seated, our chips and salsa were delivered though, for taste, they were just average.  Our server was very friendly and efficient.   Margarita was superb.   Food-wise, it was ok but not stellar.  I ordered a combination plate of a beef enchilada and a tamale with rice and refried beans.  Can't say the enchilada impressed me any.  Not quite worthy of a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"I miss their little place but I understand why they expanded.  The food was excellent.  The margarita had hardly any alcohol in it, though."}
{"text":"Oh, El Camp. I know that this place really isn't that authentic when it comes to its food, but I love it. One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  The service here for awhile was really slow if sitting at the tables in the bar area, depending on who your server is. Sitting at the actual bar, things always seemed to move much faster. They have a decent beer selection, better liquor selection, and reasonable prices. Actually, their prices in general are quite low. Our last visit saw us order 3 plates of food, chips & salsa, one beer, and two sangrias for under $30 (sangrias were a tad pricey at $7.50 apiece).  We always seem to be in here when there's a game going on and they definitely have a good setup in the bar area for watching. The decor in this place also cracks me. Sort of feed the stereotypes, if you know what I mean, but it's all tongue-in-cheek, good humor.  The one thing I always get is a side order chicken enchilada. Always. Doesn't matter what else I'm ordering. I love that thing, yummy. The tostadas are ok, burritos and tamales are pretty good, tacos are bad (stay away from those).   If you're in the North Hills area and looking for something quick, cheap, but still pretty good to eat, I recommend this over something like Applebee's."}
{"text":"Good food, inexpensive, and the staff is always so damned friendly. Their quesadillas are always on point, and the fajitas are amazing. Everything comes out fast, group orders are timed well.   The atmosphere could be improved, but as far as the food and staff is concerned this place is great."}
{"text":"The food was decent. I had the steak and cheese quesadilla. The service on the other hand was horrible. We sat for about 20 mins with empty plates before they came over to ask us if we were done and wanted our check. I didn't even see a waiter for that length of time. It was if they were all hiding in the back room. Don't think I will be back"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant! Their queso dip is to die for, and they always bring you complimentary chips and salsa upon being seated. Waiters are extremely friendly and kind, and I don't think I've ever waited more than 10 minutes for my food. They have a very large menu selection also. Prices are very reasonable and the quality is fantastic. Also a really great environment; very colorful and has an authentic feel!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican I have had in Pittsburgh area! Excellent courteous prompt service. They offer multiple chips & salsa. Wish this was located very close to home!"}
{"text":"this is our go to place for Mexican. I have been going here for almost 15 years even when it was in its old location in Monroeville. The food is always been absolutely fantastic and very reasonably priced. very happy they have been able to move to the new building just down from the old one."}
{"text":"Second time here, this is our favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. Large portions and great food. Fast and friendly service.  You can also get your food to go which is great! I love their refried beans, love their rice, love the flautas, chili verde, enchiladas, tacos and chips and salsa. My husband ate an entire bowl of the salsa and chips himself last time he went. The salsa has just the right amount of heat. The only thing that would make it better, to me, is if they had a chunkier version. When you're in the mood for some great food hit up El Campesino. You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why some people on here dislike this place.  One guy complained that they didn't offer fish tacos.  So what?  Not every restaurant has what you want.    They offer pretty good Mexican style food at reasonable prices.  The service is not great but not as bad as some people have said.  The chips are always warm and tasty, not half taco shells as another poster wrote.  Go try it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"This place was once good several years ago. We gave it another chance today but it was not good. The food is under seasoned and for some reason wet. Our tacos were all soggy to the point of needing to eat them with a fork and knife. The prices have gone up recently and it is no longer a cheap meal."}
{"text":"If you like authentic Mexican food, don't go there.  If, however, your idea of Mexican food is a cheesy enchilada, a large margarita and possibly french fries, well, then this is right up your alley.  The service is always friendly and we've very seldom had to wait long for our food.  The prices are a little steep for what it is and the offerings are your typical very Americanized fare with a Mexican twist.  If, however, you're missing the west coast and just really want comida autentica, well, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went to this place with my wife and friend for the first time. We got seated right away and before I even had my jacket off a guy brought over fresh tortilla chips and some amazing salsa. Sadly, that's as good as our night got. We waited roughly 15 minutes before the waitress came to take our drink orders and then another 15 minutes before she took our food orders. By this time we were out of Chips so I asked for more chips and salsa. She came back 15 minutes later with chips only so we waited approximately 40 minutes to get our food as we sat there and watched the table next to us receive and finish their meals before we got ours even though they arrived 10-15 minutes after us. We asked for salsa at this time as well.  Finally the meal itself was nothing to brag about. Not bad, but not really good either. My wife got the California burrito which had tomatoes even though she asked for no tomato. My friend got the chicken quesadilla which was very small and didn't even come with lettuce, tomato, sour cream or salsa and I got the enchiladas super rancheras It was supposed to be 1 cheese, 1 chicken, 1 beef, 1 shredded beef, and 1 other kind of enchilada. I only received 3 of them but instead of complaining I just ate it instead of having to wait another 30 minutes for a new dish.   We did ask to speak to a manager and we were told there was no manager so the shift leader came over and we explained how long we had to wait in which she took off 50 percent. We never had our drinks refilled either until the very end when we had to ask.   Overall, the chips and salsa were great, the food was so/so , but the service was atrocious. We got there at 6:00 and were there well after 8. We were an abandoned table just sitting there and the orders were prepared with little effort and incorrectly. We will probably go back and give it another chance maybe for lunch, but it was just a really bad experience tonight. If you go here I recommend going around 4 or for lunch and to be very specific as to what you are ordering."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because I was told it would be authentic Mexican food, but from experience of being in Mexico, I can say it was still a mix of Mexican and Tex-Mex with the food quality being disappointing. I am from Texas and it doesn't live up to Tex-Mex standards either.   I had a combination platter with a beef enchilada and burrito. Both had a good flavor sauce on top, but inside was nothing but unflavored hamburger meat. Very bland!   Warning: In small print on the menu it says \"first bowl of chips is free, but second bowl is not\"   I would put this restaurant in the category of what I call \"cheap generic Mexican food\" but for a slightly higher price."}
{"text":"There are several Mexican places around but this place is by far the best. All of the staff is nice except one guy. I don't know his name, but if you get him, you will know. He is terrible. Have to ask him several times just to get a beer. Super burrito is awesome! I recommend getting it with all chicken and no beef."}
{"text":"I come to El Campesino every time I visit Pittsburgh from Las Vegas. That says something right there. They're always polite and the food is fresh and good. They have the numbered platters and the more traditional dishes like enchiladas de mole and camarones mojo de ajo."}
{"text":"I love El Campesino.  My favorite location is the one on McKnight Road, but they are all good.  My favorite dish is the Chili Rellano (on the \"Sides and a la Carte\" portion of the menu) - do yourself a favor and order 3 as an entree.  The chile verde is also wonderful."}
{"text":"El Camp, Monroeville, cannot be beat. The food is consistently fresh and delicious and the service is quick and attentive.   It's colorful and bright and they have not disappointed, ever!  We get dressed up and go there. We go after summer yard work and in the winter in sweat suits. We go for leisurely \"dates\" and for quick meals. It's one of our favorite spots - period.   It gets pretty crowded on Friday and Saturday nights so we usually go through the week our on Sunday evening.   The dishes are flavorful and fabulous. Pollo Mexicano is a favorite, chicken + chorizo + jalapenos = YUM!  One of my husband's favorites is the Guadalajara Special, a little bit of everything, but be warned: it's HUGE!  Here's a hidden treasure tip:  The chicken soup is a very large serving and a meal in itself. It is a great blend of some pretty simple ingredients and is warming and filling. Comfort food at it's finest. Most people don't even know it's on the menu, neither did I until I saw it walk past one visit. I tried it the next visit and have had it several times since. It's fantastic.   We have several Mexican restaurants to choose from but none of them compare to the flavors of El Camp!"}
{"text":"Not only did the woman taking my order give me attitude over the phone but after driving 30 mins to pick up our food, they told us it would only take 15 minutes, we were 10 minutes late and still had to wait 10+ minutes to pick it up. All the food we got was cold, they forgot 4 tacos and when I called, I again got attitude from the worker and got mocked for being upset about the situation. Food isn't even that good anyway but to spend $50 on it and not receive it all, I think anyone would be upset."}
{"text":"Had dinner at El Campiseno's last night.  Quaint little place located in one of the shopping plazas off of Route 19. My girlfriend and I like to sit at the bar when we go out and last night was no exception. I ordered an Amber Dos Equies and my lady got a margarita. We found the place to be very friendly. The bar keep was attentive yet kept a conversation going with the people at the bar... a conversation that we subtly got sucked into while enjoying the nacho's, sipping our drinks and looking over the menu.  I decided on the tried and true #21 combo platter: one taco, one burrito and a bean tostada.  My date had the #25 combo: one enchilada, one burrito, rice and refried beans.  Both of our meals came out quickly and both were delicious.  My overall impression of this place is high. Good quality food, fast friendly service in a very clean and comfortable atmosphere. Four stars is about right."}
{"text":"This place opened just as I was about to leave for college and back then I wasn't so impressed. So when I decided to give it another try nearly ten years later I thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt. They had, after all, won best Mexican restaurant at least twice by the plaques on the wall. I should have known better. I went for a combo platter with a cheese enchilada, a beef burrito and a chile relleno. My fiancé went for the lunch special with a taco, chile relleno and guacamole salad. Now to clarify for anyone reading this, a chile relleno literally means a filled pepper. Traditionally that is a poblano pepper roasted with the skin taken off, then with good oaxacan cheese put inside and finally to be battered in egg and fried. When done right, it's one of the most amazing dishes ever. Done wrong and you get what they served here. A scoop of ground beef drowned in processed cheese sauce with a sliver of poblano hidden in the middle. Whatever this was, a chile relleno it was not. The sad part is that this restaurant is not the only one I've seen serve it this way.  On to the burrito. A large tortilla filled with ground beef. That's it? No tomatoes, onions, rice, or even the classic Mexican space filler, bean? And can I make a request regarding my final dish, the enchilada? No processed cheese, please. And is there a shortage of enchilada sauce? Because the sauce slathered on top almost reminded me of spaghetti sauce, tomatoes but no chiles. I'm sorry that it looks like I'm being so rough on them, but this does kind of cooking does not deserve Mexican restaurant of the year."}
{"text":"Great place to go with friends. Food is amazing-always fresh. Place is spotless. The staff is hardworking. Ask for the hot salsa in the back-muy bueno! Place is totally legit. Best  Mexican  food in town!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this place is under a new owner or what but the menu and service has definitely changed. Prices are higher, food quality is lower, and you're limited to one basket of chips before being charged. I got the steak burrito, as usual, and the portion was way smaller than recent times I've visited.. and the quality of the food was poor. My husband got a combo meal, and it was also subpar. I would save yourself a visit since it appears to be a new atmosphere.... and go elsewhere. Such a let down."}
{"text":"Great food. Authentic flavors. We had a group of 12 and the service was outstanding. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I used to love this restaurant. It still has quick service but the food is awful now.  Everything tastes  old, our guacamole was even brown today. It seems like they just pre make everything and then heat it up before serving.  There was barely and lettuce in my salad and nothing had any flavor."}
{"text":"Food is fine if you want Mexican in Northeast Ohio.  Still looking for outstanding Mexican, but this is our family's best option in the area. Staff is very friendly and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I had a fajita (steak, chicken, and shrimp). The portion was generous and the food was fresh and nicely spicy. The service was also good and quite quick. I've been to some pretty bad Mexican restaurants lately, so this was a huge improvement."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm a Mexican food snob because I lived in the South for a while, but I can't really get into this place.  I've eaten here several times over the years and I can't say I've had an experience that I could consider great.  I can still remember the first time that my friend and I ate there...She ordered a salad and the server brought out a saucer covered in shredded lettuce (like the stuff you put in the tacos) and white shredded cheese.  That's it.  I'd consider that a salad fail.     What I do like about the place is that it is very affordable, but really in order for them to have been open as long as they have, they have to be cheap."}
{"text":"Always good food and fast friendly service! The queso is amazing and the chips are fresh and delicious. I have had the quesadilla, the enchiladas, the beans and rice and have never had a bad experience there ever. Good Mexican food."}
{"text":"They changed their menu and prices. Beware!  You can't even get the bland pseudo Mexican you used to be able to get there for ultra cheap. Now it tastes like cardboard and they charge out the yin yang for it!  Do yourself a favor: skip this place and head across Kent to Guacamole's. You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Its a shame there isnt a rating lower than 1 star.  I had been to El Campesino several times with my fiancee, there food wasn't bad.  BUT the most recent time and the absolute last time I have and will ever go there my fiancee's burrito had dozens of small beetles mixed in with the  ground beef.  upon discovering this we called over our waitress, predictably barely spoke English, and pointed out the BUGS in the food.  Her reaction was completely underwhelming.  The manager never came over to apologize and we had to fight to get them to take the BUG burrito off the bill, you can completely forget them comping the meal even though chances are MY food had BUGS in it too.  The waitress never even apologized.  I have never had a problem like this at any other restaurant but I am sure this is the sort of thing the manager should come out and at least apologize for.  I will never go back this this location or any other, and a suggest everyone that goes there check their food very well."}
{"text":"Our party of 12 nearly brought this restaurant to its knees....  While the family we are visiting swears that the service here is usually very fast (and since they are a family of 9...they should know!), it took more than an hour between when we sat down and when our meals arrived.  And then not ALL the meals arrived.  It took another 10-15 minutes for the last 3 to hit our table.  Then....nothing!  No server.  No check.  It was not until we made motions to leave that our server trotted over with the bill.    All in all, an inexpensive option for feeding a crowd ($150-$160 with tax), but not someplace I would visit on a regular basis if I lived here."}
{"text":"Aw hell, I thought I was in for a Mexican treat prior to the Motley Crue concert at First  Niagara when I saw the rustic, \"authentic\" decor and was greeted by our humble, gracious, classy, and thoroughly attentive server. I was even more hopeful when that mortar full of chunky, ideally lemon-tinged guacamole came out along with a batch of oily, brittle tortilla chips.   The salsa, which I all but totally ignored, tasted to have originated from a economy-sized aluminum can pulled from a Big Lots shelf. Lifeless, it merely smacked of watery Ragu and a packet of salad seasoning.   My burrito, properly fat, was stuffed with ground beef that apparently was \"filled out\" by ground turkey. I've had ground turkey. I know how grainy it can be. I know its flavor. It isn't nauseating by any means, but damn it...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvyc-CiLZxQ  Why I ordered churros for dessert, I can't explain. Perhaps I thought that maybe there was a chance they'd be made on the premises, but they were too uniform, too pristine, too cryogenic. I kept wondering which convenience store I could get them from, that apple filling recalling The Clown or Tiny Deborah In The Cellophane Dress.   Each dish was plated gorgeously, however.   Many of these Mexican places keep popping up in the suburbs of Western Pennsylvania of late, and I can't help but suspect that they are all part of a chain that's trying to hide the fact that it is a many-tentacled chain. The menus are the same. The food's the same. Only the names differ.   Strange. Unsatisfying. Next!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and thought I would give this a try despite mixed reviews, and was very disappointed. My dining companion bit into a huge piece of cartilage in his pork. The waitress took his plate and when the manager came out, he proceeded to lecture my friend that he wasn't used to corn tortillas and sometimes they can have hard bits. Once we insisted that no, we understand what corn tortillas are and that was not at all the issue, he put in an order for a different dish for my friend and then came back out and apologized because at that point he had actually looked at the plate and saw what we were referring to. Generally we're both really forgiving if something happens with the plate of food as long as it is handled courteously, and we're not argumentative, we just want to enjoy our dinner, so we were a bit irritated to get an unnecessary lecture as part of our dining experience. This was on top of the food being not that great, and rather expensive for what it is. I really love Mexican food, and found my plate to be not very flavorful. I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Not what you'd expect if you're used to Mexucan chains. This is authentic Reminds me of food I ate in Cozamel and Mexico City. Not Tex Mex or that food claiming to be Mexican that's barrly a cut above Taco bell. The blend of flavors and spices are excellent. Mexican cheese, not processed cheese or nacho cheese. Great blends. Quality. Nice atmosphere, good service. They can accommodate my friend's gluten intolerance with corn tortillas. Enjoy every time. Love the appraiser of Chorizo and cheese."}
{"text":"Yesterday was the first time I went here. I got food poisoning here and service was horrible. I'm not going back!!! I don't recommend this place to anyone. Eat at your own risk!"}
{"text":"This place has a huge menu! But the first thing I noticed is it's kinda shabby looking on the outside and lacking in Mexican flavor on the inside. No big deal, I'm looking for food, right? And they did do a good job there. Can't complain. Outside deck seating is a nice feature, but it doesn't come with much of a view. Good tequila selection to customize that perfect Margarita, and good food both on the cheaper and more expensive side. I prefer other spots for my Mexican fix, but would have no problem ending up here."}
{"text":"The food here has always been a letdown for me. It is as though nothing is made fresh other than the chips and maybe the salsa. The meat in the entrees seems as though it has been preheated and sitting in a pan of its own juices for far too long, dry but wet. The margaritas are ok, but they are just from a juice box mix.  Damn it for being the only Mexican place with a liquor license within 10 miles."}
{"text":"California Burrito was delicious! Mango margarita was tasty! Good service. No hot sauces on the table. $1.25 for extra sour cream. Overall, It was really pleasant."}
{"text":"Overwhelmed with how spot-on this place was, another win for the strip mall hell of the North Hills.  It's a further drive than Mexico City downtown, but absolute worth eating here as well.  We walked out both fat and happy, as everything they served was perfect and delicious.  I would call this Mexican, not so much Tex-Mex; they have chips and salsa for an appetizer, but they don't have chili, and we had a large selection of items without a fajita or any beef in sight.  Great service, great portions, great food, great variety.  A+++."}
{"text":"Love love love this restaurant! I've been coming here since I was a kid and I am always satisfied every time. The service is quick and friendly the food is excellent and very reasonably priced. I'm a customer for life!"}
{"text":"The service is fast and friendly. The chips were hot and fresh but the salsa was bland - not much more than canned tomato flavor. Our meals were both delicious, although the pico and guacamole were heavy handed on onion. Overall, I would say El Campesino is good for a quick lunch or dinner if you're shopping in the Monroeville area."}
{"text":"Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing. Perhaps I was there on the wrong day, but everything about this meal was pretty bad. Chips and salsa were okay.  The tables were sticky, the dishes didn't look terribly clean and my food was pretty bland. I'm not in a hurry to give it another shot. My girlfriend found it to be mediocre and has interest in going back, but I'd rather drive a little bit to get something that has more flavor to their food."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  Food is outstanding and the price is the same as if you went to a Mexican fast casual place.  Recommend the fried ice cream with Carmel sauce."}
{"text":"Inexpensive and consistent tex/mex at El Campesino.    When you've got that craving for some reliable tex/mex, this is as good a place as any.  You know what you're getting and it's the same every time.  Full bar, kid friendly and not loud inside.    It's also got some high tables near the bar and lots of booths going to the rear of the restaurant.  It's surprisingly big inside  You'd never guess that by standing out front."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancée are regulars here. We just don't check-in all the time. Every time we come here, the waiters served us with an attitude. Throwing the menu on the table, throwing the plates with the food on it at us, making rude jesters while taking our orders are just some of the things they do on a regular basis. They constantly serve us with wrong orders, refill our drinks with wrong drinks, and yet we come every time hoping that there would be a change. This is the last time I will ever come to this restaurant. The management is absolutely horrible we've been sitting here for 30 minutes while we're waiting for someone to come so we can return the crunchy rice that they served my fiancée along with the cokes that taste like dr. Pepper."}
{"text":"Just ate here, had the Chimichanga and they were great. There are no complaints price was very good. There is always a happy hour special with different drinks daily"}
{"text":"A chile relleno is a stuffed pepper, a stuffed chile pepper.  Hence the name.  Tex-Mex, Cal-Mex, Yucatan, Mexico City, everywhere - it's a stuffed pepper.  But El Campesino  thinks that it's a clump of tasteless ground meat with a 1/4 inch slice of a green pepper in it somewheres, topped with white cheese.  This was about as horrid as Mexico City's so-called 'carnitas.'  If you're going to deviate from a standard dish, it would be wise to explain that on the menu."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend I was visiting. I would call this more of a tex-mex place than truly mexican. That said my dish was delish, some sort of cheesey sauce and a TON of food. Guac was only ok, but my VERY large (and cheap for happy hour) magherita was yummy."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food, but I'm not sure I'd say its the best I've ever had. One specific perk that I really love about this place is that the food is always really hot (as in warm). You meal is always served to you on an extra hot plate, which helps to keep your food hot during the entire meal.   The service here, as I've experienced it and observed, has always been good. Service is nice and quick. Ever since they moved locations, within the same plaza, they can accommodate larger groups and more people overall. The newer building has nice murals on the walls and overall has a cleaner feel. Also they have a pretty nice big bar next to the entrance.   I'd suggest this place to try out for above average Mexican food."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to elcampesino ever since I was a child, when the location was next to the old party store in the plaza. I'm rating this a 3 stars (which used to be a 5) due to the fact that the prices have raised over the years and the portions have gotten drastically smaller. I was very disappointment in my last trip to the restaurant, as was my boyfriend. We both waited about 15-20 minutes for anyone to even recognize that we had  already been seated. After I received my food, which always comes out exceptionally fast... I was astonished by the amount of rice and beans that I was given. Literally half of the amount I've been given in the past. For the price of my meal, I was very disappointed. Not only were the portions small, my rice was over cooked. Despite this, I will be returning.. but also hoping my next Elcamp experience will be better."}
{"text":"Very good food and drinks. Reasonable prices. Ambience is very casual. They have corona light on tap and the margaritas are huge. I got the chicken fajita quesadillas and they were delicious. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really love their food! I always get the Chicken Fajitas and always love them. The queso dip is also very good! I would give this place five stars except the service isn't always the best. A few of the waiters are not friendly and do not check back to their tables often which is annoying."}
{"text":"I sure miss Chi Chi's. But this place makes up for it. The food is excellent and the wait staff is always on the ball. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for great Mexican food."}
{"text":"The food was great. Hot. Fresh. The fajitas were amazing,  and my friend enjoyed the queso."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Friday night. It was my first time at El Campesino.   We were promptly seated and greeted. That had to be the last good thing I have to say. The restaurant seemed a bit unkept. Tables were not cleaned, floor was a bit dirty. Our waiter had us waiting a while from the time we got drinks to ordering, then I had to just hand him my card to finally get a check to leave.   Food portions were huge, but only okay. We just got quesadillas but I didn't think it was something I would go out of my way for. They did seem like they had a nice patio area that would be nice."}
{"text":"I have a few friends who like this place, but it was just ok for me as far as the look of the place and margarita compared to the other mexican restaurants I've been to in the wexford/cranberry area.  I had a house margarita on the rocks and it was ok but seemed to have more margarita mix?  I do think Emiliano's up in Cranberry makes them better.  Even Madmex is a little better even though that seems non-authentic.  I also had a quesadila roja (beef tips, sour cream, lettuce, a single slice of tomato, and mexican rice.  It was tasty but I felt I was still hungry after eating it and I'm pretty petite.  If you are claustrophobic, you will probably feel more claustrophobic if you dine inside because it seems cramped in there."}
{"text":"The chips served with salsa while I waited for a to go order were fried in rancid oil. Not planning to return.  Previous visits were just OK. Bland, pre made ingredients thrown together and reheated. Fast service, but not good quality food. Certainly not tasty."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!? Are you kidding me!? This place was just plain bad. They lost tons of points with me for not offering fish or pork tacos. So already feeling like I wanted to leave, I just ordered something small.   I got one of the vegetarian combos with a cheese enchilada, bean tostada, and rice. The enchilada sauce was bland and the enchilada had little filling. The tostada was stale and didn't come with sour cream. The rice was also bland and their was about a half pound of it.   As an aside, i think I've been in cleaner restrooms at gas stations. Ugh, foul.   I won't be going back. I went home and ate cereal."}
{"text":"By far one of the best Mexican restaurants around. They have a chicken dish covered with Chorizo sausage, jalapenos and cheese. It is so good and spicy. I have been to many Mexican restaurants and I think the food is so unique. Delicious salsa too. I visit this place a lot and look forward to many more visits.  Dionne Malush, Realtor"}
{"text":"For as busy as this place gets, service is incredibly fast. Sure, I've waited to be seated but never waited long for my meal or for a refill. The food and drinks here are delicious, especially the fajita's. Gotta end it with the deep fried ice cream. Truly authentic Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Once again, local Yelppers have led me down the primrose path....this place is just wrong on so many levels. Does anyone in the Pittsburgh area even know what real Mexican food is supposed to taste like?  I'm from California where we have lot's of Mexican's and therefore, Mexican restaurants and I have been to Mexico on many occasions. I went here based on favorable Yelp reviews, are you kidding me? This place is horrible!  First off, there was no hostess to seat you, so two servers tried to seat me in their areas. Chips and salsa tasted about as good as Pace picante sauce and the chips were flavorless.  After finally making some sense of their menu (unusual descriptions of their 'specialties'), I ordered the #24 combo (1 burrtio, 1 enchilada and 1 chile relleno). What showed up was a plate of what looked like vienna sausages(small) smothered in red sauce. Nope it was the burrito, enchilada and \"something\". I asked the server if the combination plates come with refried beans and rice, he said, no but you could order them separately....seriously? I've never ordered a 'combo' plate anywhere that didn't include beans and rice, but ok. Under the red sauce were these 1 inch by 4 inch tortilla shaped things which were stuffed with cheese, now the cheese was great but I still couldn't figure out where the rest of the food was, these things were tiny!! Now, remember I ordered 1 burrito, 1 enchilada and a chile relleno, and what I received was 1 small burrito, and even smaller enchilada, and what should have been a chile rellno was a small pile of ground beef with melted cheese on it, not sure exactly what that was supposed to be, but it wasn't a chili and there was no relleno.  Bottom line, go anywhere but here....Taco Bell makes my stomach turn, but I would even have to at least consider it before going back to this place."}
{"text":"They have consistent and decent food at a decent price. Their service and food is pretty fast, and they have a decent variety of options. Nice local place"}
{"text":"Fabulous authentic Mexican food, not Americanized Tex Mex! The service is excellent and the prices are right!"}
{"text":"See the picture posted of their supposed chile relleno. Just gross, and they didn't apologize or take it back."}
{"text":"Food is so so. Our pitcher of margaritas, without a doubt, did not contain a single drop of alcohol. Twenty bucks for a pitcher of ice and sour mix."}
{"text":"I have been there twice now and am not going to go into all the details as to why this experience is poor.  I'll sum it up by stating that I can make better Mexican food at home for half the price.  I can see the bar area as fun if you take it over with a bunch of friends, but the place is otherwise off my list."}
{"text":"This is the real deal IF you like authentic mexican food.  Now, if you are part of the taco bell army (of which I have been known to be a soldier) you are in for something very different when you enter \"El Camp\".  I've recommended this place to many a friend only to hear how disappointed they were with the food.  This is a normal response if you are used to eating a Bacon Club Chalupa and considering it Mexican gourmet.  If you like authentic Mexican or want to try authentic Mexican I've been told by many \"authentic mexicans\" this is the place to go.  This review is for the Monroeville location, located beautifully next to a paper mart and another strip mall staple (your token chinese joint), however between these two common stores lies a delicious oasis of Mole sauce and Poblanos.  They have multiple locations all over the city, but I believe this is the original.  The other locations are a bit more upscale with a bar and happy hour scene.  I go here about once a month or so usually with staff.  The meal starts with their delicious home made chips and salsa.  They have a couple varieties for those of us who like spicier foods.  Some of the more adventorous dishes I've tried were \"Chile Poblanos, Two whole poblano peppers stuffed with white Mexican cheese, topped with egg white, rice, refried beans, three tortillas (corn or flour) and ranchero sauce on top.\" and \"Mole Ranchero, Brown sauce made with Mexican spices with shredded chicken, served with rice and choice of guacamole salad or tossed salad.\".  Both were delicious and unfortunately not having tried these at other spots don't have the background to compare.  I can tell you they tasted great and the portions were good.  I usually stick to the more basic offerings such as fagitas, tacos, and burritos.  They are always cooked perfectly with a generous portion of meats and cheeses and plenty of mexican condiments.  I suggest going to this place multiple times and hopefully being a litte more adventorous than me."}
{"text":"There are a number of other GREAT options in Monroeville for Mexican food.  I hadn't been back to El Campesino in years (they were at the other end of the plaza last time I ate there).  Tonight's visit was our last.  Bland food and after our server delivered it he didn't bother to come back to the table.  We had to get drink refills by calling the hostess over."}
{"text":"I hate to do it, but I can only award one star. I've come here a handful of times and each time I leave more disappointed than the previous. I started my experience with a house margarita, not the fresh made kind, rather the kind where a bottle of prepackaged mix is added to the tequila. Strike one. Strike two is for the Veg Fajita meal. If you've ever had a fajita at any other reputable Mexican restaurant you would expect a sizzling cast iron skillet with deliciously charred vegetables, right? Well, what you get here is the same cast iron skillet with previously heated vegetables. No sizzle. No char. If you've cooked one day in your life, you would know that these were cooked way ahead of time. It didn't help their case when it was 80% green peppers with maybe two florets each of cauliflower and broccoli. I asked the gentleman, \"Why isn't it sizzling?\" He told me to touch the skillet to prove that it was hot. The final strike was the following: Sprite was only carbonated water. Not omitting certain items requested from a dish. Stale corn flakes on the fried ice cream. Maybe i'm asking for too much, but I feel that this place has seen better days. Maybe."}
{"text":"My favorite of the local Mexican Restaurants! The food is always fresh with friendly, fast service. Great atmosphere. Best guacamole anywhere. Good menu variety. Clean restrooms. Ample parking. Overall quality is consistent."}
{"text":"I always enjoy eating there. The food is good and the service friendly and fast. They have daily lunch specials so be sure and ask. I try to go once a week."}
{"text":"The place is slipping a bit lately. Had a vegatarian combo that was bland, tasteless and quite watery. The beans were the consistency of thin oatmeal. No taste at all to say the least. The server barely spoke to us and seemed put out to even have to be waiting on us. Sad enough to try someplace different for Mexican next time"}
{"text":"We had an enjoyable experience for dinner last night. We wanted to watch the pens game and eat a yummy Mexican dinner at the same time so we figured this was a good choice to try. We requested to be near a tv and were sat at a booth where only one of us could really see the tv, but the food and service made up for it. At first service was a bit slow since it was busy, but once we ordered our food it did come out super fast. I ordered the enchiladas and my boyfriend got the taco, enchilada, and tostado combo. We loved the food it was all delicious. I also ordered a coronarita-yummy! We had a nice time and will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"For being a chain Mexican joint, I expected more.  I'm really surprised to see and hear that it is normally a pretty full guest list being that there was nothing too appeasing.  It's authentic staff hardly speaks English, hardly shows up at your table, and is hardly complimentary in any way.  The food was terribly bland for a Mexican joint and the margaritas were a little mix heavy.  If you have never eaten authentic Mexican, then this place may be just tame enough for the shy.  I was really let down that they only had one dish with chorizo and I didn't see nor taste a bit of cilantro on anything.  I'm not sure if they're lack of effort is due to the fact that Pittsburgh does not have a very heavy Mexican culture or I'm still caught up of having the excellent service and food from my old neighborhood in Chicago, but I won't be returning here."}
{"text":"This place is all right. Some of the friends and I stopped by and had some chips and salsa and margarita's and from what I sampled it was pretty good. I'll have to stop by again and actually have dinner but the real win here was the margaritas.   It was your typical sugary sour mix type of margarita, but I liked that you could buy them in various flavors including one that had red bull in it. They also came in three sizes small, medium, and large. The large was 12.50 and I think 2 of them could put pretty much anyone under a table.   The decor of this place was your typical cheap mexican restaurant type of decor and seems to fit in nicely sitting next to a laser tag joint, but if you are in the need of a 45 oz margarita then this place is for you."}
{"text":"The service is really poor. The waiter was a jerk. Other el camps are not like this. Avoid this place if you can."}
{"text":"I'm torn with this one. I went on a late friday night. And The food was  great. The service was great. But the attitude and atmosphere is very awkward.   Idk if it's because I'm black or if it was because I was talking to my friend about how much Pizza Huts pizza taste more like bread sticks these days.   Whatever the case maybe, we got stared down. Like STAAAAAARED DOWN. By both the customers and the workers. Threw out the time, turned my head and made eye contact with what I counted to be about 9 different people. Then they would quickly look away and pretend like we didnt see eachother. I'm not exaggerating.   Listen, when I go to a restaurant, I'm there to eat. If I'm so beautiful or ugly ,then politely ask for a picture. If you think I'm there to rob you. Stop. I would never steal nor theif someone out of their Mexican dinner. Bloody Hell."}
{"text":"I live in Arizona so Pennsylvania mexican food usually freaks me out, but this place was pretty good. It's in a quiet little strip mall, so it's not crowded. We did a lunch recently and maybe three tables had people. We each had a nice meal and enjoyed each other's company. The waiters were really nice and polite. They had knowledge of the menu, too."}
{"text":"I've had better Mexican cuisine in Robinson. It's reasonably priced but if I had to choose between this place and another place in Robinson, I'd choose a different place. Just saying, they are okay, definitely not the best."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in at El Campesino's in Monroeville on a whim. Our waitress, Toni or Tony? Was EXCELLENT. We hadn't been there before and we asked for recommendations. Toni made several and either she picked all the good items, or everything on the menu is good. I had cheese-stuffed shrimp for the first time. The combination of shrimp, spicy sauce, cheese, and sour cream was perfect.  From that point on it blends into a haze of excellence. Note: rumors that I started a fire with sparks from my silverware are grossly exaggerated (at worst it was just a little smokey).  EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS. Tony came by just enough to handle our needs without being obtrusive. And she pointed out that I was wearing some food in my beard. The food was so good I ordered the super burrito, ceviche, juevos rancheros and a coupke desserts to go. Good food + good service = a great experience."}
{"text":"Been here several times and always very satisfied.  Had to write a review on my last visit.  I came in from working all day in the yard and was quite thirsty.  I ordered an Arnold Palmer for my drink, which was mixed perfectly.  Anytime that glass was emtpy, it didn't take long for it to be refilled perfect every time.  We have an abundance of Mexican to choose from now, but this place is in a class of it's own."}
