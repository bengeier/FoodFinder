{"text":"Best darn food known to man. Amazing selection! Get the African dishes and don't forget to grab a meat pie! The owner is the nicest man since Lincoln. Get after it!"}
{"text":"This place is not what you expect in a mall food court.  There are a number of West African and American food options as well as chicken curry, which is quite tasty.  I tried samples of the African food, which was too spicy for my wimpy palate.  Don't let the photos of the American food fool you!  I ordered the chicken sandwich meal expecting a round, breaded circle of compressed meat.  What I got was a fresh, tenderized, battered chicken breast fillet on a toasted bun with recognizable pieces of green (not clear) lettuce, with pickles, mayo, and cheese (it also comes with onions, tomato, and ketchup, which I declined).  It took a few minutes to prepare, but it was delicious!  My portion of fries was very generous, but a little bland with good but inconsistently sprinkled seasoning (full disclosure: I'm not a huge fan of fries, anyway).  I will definitely stop here again."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and focus on the African food.  The peanut stew is awesome, as is the flavored rice.  The chicken curry, although not African, is full of flavor but not spicy hot at all.   The lovely owner works there almost all the time, and is very free with the samples.  It was amazing to get fresh homemade tasting food at this small food court restaurant."}
{"text":"The African food isn't visible on the large menu board, but step up to the case and you'll see the delicious array of options. I only asked for one dish, but he gave more four items (including a meat pie), that and a drink was under $10, and it turned into three delicious meals (one at the food court, two more the next day at home!). An awesome diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"I hate going to the mall but I'll visit there just for this food!  We had a variety of the African choices plus sweet potato pie warm out of the oven. Absolutely delicious!  Owner is super nice, too."}
{"text":"Sad to say this place has closed. Mall doubled his rent, and Taco Bell didn't like him selling food that looked like tacos. Shame. 6/23/17

  Surprise! Good BBQ at the mall. Large portions, great seasoning. Ribs were tender, lightly sauced (didn't see extra sauce anywhere), did I mention tender? Not the biggest ribs in Madison, but more than made up for with the piled on sides.  Cheapest BBQ on the west side, best value too."}
{"text":"Let me paint a picture, it's 12:45pm on a weekday at the food court. It's relatively slow with no line at the Burgers + Ethnic Food B-B-Q. The worker gives you two free samples of beef and chicken. Nothing special, but there's no line and should be quick. I order a simple chicken sandwich and it'll be seven minutes (fresh to order). Okay, I have time.

Same guy disappears back into the kitchen and gives me an update two minutes out. I step away from the counter and check two minutes later... almost ready. I check again and get \"oh, I forgot about you.\" What?? He was looking at his phone while he waited and I'm his only customer. You forgot about your ONE customer?

He throws in a free batch of fries and (drum roll) a cup of water for the wait. That's right, I got a free water. The fries were dry and some were crunchy.

Surprisingly, the chicken sandwich was tasty and moist. The bun was great too. Maybe one of the best chicken sandwiches I've had in a food court.

The whole experience was frustrating and I still don't know how he pulled off the chicken sandwich, when it should have been dry with how long he let it sit on the grill."}
{"text":"I am SO excited that there is a West African restaurant in town. I have tried the ben achin (a little more like jollof than ben achin or chebu jen), domoda and the jerk chicken. They were all great and I am really looking forward to trying the yassa next. The main problem is the location (mall food court) but my excitement way outweighs this minor inconvenience. Try it out!"}
