{"text":"Awesome Italian ice and huge hot dogs. My family enjoyed having this next to the fountain show in Station Square. Very convenient and the kids loved it! Definitely try it if you are in the area, very reasonable."}
{"text":"I was biking around and decided to see the fountain at Bessemer Court, and this little stand right next to the fountain happened to catch my eye.  They have ice cream and Italian ice, (along with lots of other things), and when you combine the two, it is called Gelati.  I had a mango gelati, and it was a nice treat on a warm afternoon of biking.  The woman working the counter was very nice, and I had good service, and the treat was delicious, and VERY COLD . . . got a little bit of an ice cream headache . . . LOL."}
{"text":"Super hot today, and I was on a long walk from PNC park to the boat launch at 10th Street. Should I get water? Heck no!  Not when there's Italian shaved ice available! This little kiosk is very convenient if you're walking or biking along the river trail. I got a gelati with mango Italian ice and ate it while walking alongside the Mon. Delicious and refreshing!"}
{"text":"My seasonal work treat! I wish this place could be open year round. Great little kiosk that serves up everything from hot dogs to ice cream. Of course my fave would be Italian Ice with lots of flavors to choose from and low calories. It seems to be a favorite with tourists as well because they do get a long line now and again. That long line seems to vanish quickly with efficiency. Worth the wait."}
