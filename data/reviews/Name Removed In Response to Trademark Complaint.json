{"text":"There is nothing special about this bar. I've gone three times and no menu item I've ordered impressed me. It was fair. Nothing I would order agian. The server is rather chummy and some customers enjoy this. Personally I do not. Please don't tell me how to eat or drink. It pisses me off when you get chummy with my girl. Friendly is fine but chummy pisses me off.  Now I see it's closed."}
{"text":"sunday night bartender is rude! we sat down, were rudely told to \"pull our i.d.s out\"  while we decided whether or not to stay, decided to leave and hear her tell another customer \"oh, imagine that!\" refering to us, assuming we are underage or something? my friend turned around and confronted her, she tried to justify her comment that maybe we forgot our i.d.s ...regardless, she was rude... never coming in on a sunday again... barely like the place anyways..."}
{"text":"Watered down beer and liquor. Food is mediocre at best. The place may have been a little run down before it was taken over, but the six tables they replaced didn't spruce it up that much. Last night we ordered TACOS. They came with taco sauce that tasted mysteriously like cocktail sauce. When we asked for salsa it tasted like stewed tomatoes with jalape√±os. Their chefs or owners need to taste their food. Yuck. It a time where bars and pubs are known for their food. This place will not be able to compete."}
{"text":"The lasagne was tasty and the salad fresh, but the serving size didn't warrant the 10 buck charge."}
{"text":"The perfect local bar/grill....  Very impressive place, great cocktail selection, plenty of draft+bottle beer choices, excellent service by the bartenders, very good+affordable menu items. Love the gyros, chicken.  Try a \"stoner\" specialty tanquerray+tonic... youll love it!  Also ample parking and the place hardly ever closes!  I saw \"Grizzly\" band there live Sat and the place was rocking as a concert venue too!"}
