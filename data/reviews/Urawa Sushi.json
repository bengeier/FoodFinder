{"text":"I've been to so many Sushi restaurants in GTA, this is by far the best taste of them all.  I was there today, although the place seemed really quiet, the friendly staff and the great food deserve much more attention. I think I am going to pass on other restaurants from now on and only go to this one.  I had lunch All-you-can-eat for $13.99, the staff are really friendly, I am looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"This has to be by far the worst sushi restaurant in the city.  I am absolutely dumbfounded at how disgusting this sushi is. I've bitten into a frozen piece of sashimi before and for those of you that know what that is like.  this is much worse.  Its like a sushi porridge... soggy warm and just weird tasting.  I have seen good reviews on here which leads me to wonder if i got unlucky with a bad chef...   I wish i could get my money back as i stare at what looks more like alien food than sushi...   im so broken right now... man this sucks...   i was so looking forward to good sushi today.  I have never written a review before in my life.  But this brutal tasting sushi has pushed me to warn all y'all fine folk out there. STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"The worst AYCE sushi restaurant I've ever been to. Bad sushi prep, bad taste, bad decoration. At least the service was fast"}
{"text":"History:  - Visited 3 times in total, all in 2014. - Lunch AYCE for first 2, in early 2014, and July 2014. - The latest experience was August 30th, 2014.  Pure facts based on my own experience are my only component for this review.  Service: 3/5  Imagine being in a dollar store of China Town, ask one of the friendly cashiers in sight for the whereabouts of small burner liners, only to realize you now have to break down the idea of what burner liners can be, in the most simple and effective form of human language and hand gestures. That is what I've witnessed on how they deal with customers around me, who had to ask for specifics in their orders. I had nothing complicated to order. They serve fast. They're friendly. Their English isn't perfect, but they don't treat you in a wrong manner in my opinion.  Cleanliness: 2/5  Think back to the past. You've been to a cheap restaurants with mistreated washrooms. The stools that you would never want to sit on without wiping them with sanitized paper towels with a surgical mask on, and the papers will run out on you in crucial moments. Yes, exactly that. An average, sad public washrooms we all might have been to. Tables and seats, clean enough. Would I build up enough courage to eat that piece of deep fried avocado landed on the table surface? No.   Atmosphere: 3/5  Nothing surprising for AYCE restaurant. Pops playing off the speakers, creating ambient noise, chattering from distant tables, not too bright, not too dark lightings. Weird color shifting lights between the sofa seats and the wall. It's exactly what a regular AYCE goer would picture in their head.    Food: 0/5  Remember the first time riding a roller coaster? Up the hill, the ride carried you against the gravity, and you were thinking, 'Well.. so far so good, it can't be that bad, haha' and then it dropped. It almost became a flashback slideshow simulator of your entire life. If this review is a roller coaster ride, THIS is where it gets steep.  I've been to Urawa for AYCE lunch twice before, and I had no problem; a typical AYCE menu, no sashimi for lunch, features decent rolls and good enough quality among both the cooked and raw dishes.  That's what I expected this time as well. So, AYCE Dinner for two is what my party ordered.  - Green Salad:  The lettuce must have been washed the night before, left in the room temperature without any covers overnight, through the day, until it was served to my face. Someone in the kitchen must have went on a chain of experiments on lettuce treatment and thought, \"Dehydrated lettuce taste exceptional, I'm selling this.\" otherwise, I cannot explain why it is difficult to keep the juicy vegetable hydrated until it's served for paying customers.  - Wasabi and Pickled Ginger:  Exactly what kind of sorcery has to be done to undo the wasabi's spiciness and dry every drop of moisture out of these poor, pink slices of ginger? I guess dry lettuce salad was ingenius that they've decided to do the same to pickled gingers. I've been to numbers of horrendous sushi AYCE restaurants, but none of them served me dried vegetables as much as Urawa did so far.  - Rolls (names didn't matter while I was chewing down these nightmares):  Oh the missing moistures have been found at last! They saved it up for the sushi rice!   As far as I know, usually sushi restaurants prepare their sushi rice mixed with sushi vinegar and salt, cooled down ahead of the time to prevent its moisture and heat ruining the seaweed and the rest of the ingredients.  But guess what, that doesn't sound good any more. We want to live a healthy, low sodium, and hydrated life. So let's heat up the steam level. At this restaurant, sushi are supposed to be mushy and warm. You better not drown in this volume of H2O.  Also, I'm pretty sure cucumbers are the reason why we go for sushi, so you will taste hard, warm cucumbers above invisible eel pieces, deep-fried shrimps size of an infant's index finger, and even beyond the drizzle of Japanese-mayo-looking-sauce-mixed-with-sriracha.  - Cooked dishes:  They're very dedicated with keeping their food low on sodium level. I almost gave them a round of a solo applaud for this. None of the stir-fried, deep-fried or even grilled dishes were seasoned. Sweet Chili Squid with a flavour of colored water. That's what I had. Oh and, don't bother ordering the mussles or surf clams unless you like the taste of sand and fishiness.   For the first time at an AYCE experience, I sighed in happiness that they've forgotten about our chicken order.  - Dessert:  Even the icecream they serve here are somehow lower quality than other ones. I mean, come on now. Did you really bought a tub of cheaper icecream that's already cheap?  At least the deep fried banana served well though, because it tasted like... a banana.   TL; DR:  Do you know that feeling of incoming stream of painful diarrhoea, presumably caused by food poisoning? I do. If you don't want to know, do NOT go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty solid all-you-can-eat sushi. The price was great for the selection. Has the best selection of late 90s and early 2000s adult contemporary playing in the background too. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Excellent example of a restaurant cutting any corner they could find from the fish, to the bed of warm shredded carrots the fake crab and boiled shrimp were laying on.  Carrots have a distinct flavour which seemed into the fish. Daikon is usually used for a reason. The salmon was so thin you could see the rice beneath it. Worst sushi I've ever had."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend for the ayce lunch. Literally when we stepped in, the place was empty. There was literally staff just sitting down at the table talking and it looked like we interrupted them when we walked in. First thing we noticed while we were ordering, no sashimi. When we got our order, the sushi contained mostly rice and very little fish or shrimp tempura. The shrimp tempura looked like it was cut in half and deep fried. Although the sushi is a unbeatable price of 13.99 for ayce lunch but they fill you up on rice. I've tried quiet a lot of ayce and this place is probably at the bottom of that list. I would have rather gone to Aji Sai."}
{"text":"3/5. Great sashimi and amazing value! However, I have definitely had better rolls. I would recommend this place is you are very hungry and willing to try dishes aside from maki."}
{"text":"Best sushi takeout in the city, not to mention they include free rolls for orders of sufficient size. I order from them at least once a week. Reasonably priced, great portion sizes and just really, really good. Fast delivery times and great staff. If I could give it 6 stars I could."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from here.  The sushi was warm and you can tell that the salmon was sitting out for a while. My stomach is still recovering right now actually.   TMI: I had to puke like 3 times to get it all out of my system  The staff wasn't all that great either, we asked the server about the chicken teriyaki on the regular menu and yes, there was a language barrier but I specifically said \"no rice with the chicken teriyaki right? Just the chicken?\" then all she said was \"yeah yeah\" and walked away  To our surprise, it came with rice, California rolls and tempura. We were just really confused, because she said that it came alone"}
{"text":"Seriously the worst AYCE Japanese restaurant in all of Toronto, no competition. Service was prompt and friendly, however, the food was repulsive inside and out. LAYERS of rice in the rolls, and I could probably find fresher, better quality ingredients dumpster diving than the ones they used in their food. Other than the rice and noodles, portions for all other dishes were tiny, even the ice cream was of a pathetic size. One word, avoid."}
{"text":"Urawa is definitely the best fresh sushi in the city, we have been ordering food here on just eat for over a year now at least twice a week and it has never been a disappointment!  The staff is nice and friendly and even if we just ate once at this location on a Friday night, the food it is absolutely superb!  I know on lunch time the location is packed and they serve a lot of business meals and even if the location is not the best place for a romantic date, it does the trick if you go in groups for the all you can eat!  We always order the sushi online and there are always great deals and discounts and they always make sure to give us a free salmon dragon roll with our order, I believe if you order more than $30 you get complimentary. Also the delivery guy it's always the same person and it is super nice, it is super friendly.  I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the worst sushi places I've ever ordered from. I have absolutely no idea how it has managed so many 5 star reviews. Seriously, were you guys high?  Urawa has been staring at me for the last few weeks so I thought I would stop in for take out. The interior is run down and dated and their choice of music was a mixture of easy listening and crap. There were three servers with little to do since I was one of five customers at the time but they still managed to ignore me for a good five minutes before I walked up to the cash register and asked the \"chef\" if I could order something.  I ordered a green dragon roll and a bento which were both thoroughly disappointing. The sushi fell apart almost immediately after touching a small amount of soy sauce but that's probably because it was cemented to the rest of the pieces and had to be ripped apart by hand. My california roll was bland and dry and the green dragon roll was soaked in sauce of some kind. Awful. My bento came with coconut chicken, which sounded good on paper but was actually just over fried pieces of chicken with goopy coconut sauce and pineapple. Dry, yet goopy and awful. Oh, and it's fair to mention that the walk from the restaurant to my office is one minute so there's no way transit impacted the food negatively.  The final nail in the coffin, and yet most amazing part of this place for me was the incredibly sketchy looking plaque by the register stating that someone had such horrible taste buds that Urawa managed to make \"The Best Asian Food In Canada\".  For real guys, is there a second secret location that I don't know about where they actually serve good food by people that know how to make good food? Because this place makes day old supermarket sushi look like it just came out of the sea."}
{"text":"I will never order food from this restaurant anymore. Very little portion with rice and Unagi on half of the box, and tons of ginger wasabi and carrot on the other side..I was actually surprised they could deliver this to their customer."}
{"text":"Pretty sure this place upset my stomach. And not because I over ate ... Well, because I overrate bad sushi probably. It tasted good, but man was my stomach turning 2 hours later."}
{"text":"I don't ever take the time to write reviews but for this place I really had to.  I've been coming here at least once a week for the past month or so and the sushi is ALWAYS fresh and SO delicious.   Their AYCE lunch is only $12.99 and is on until 5pm unlike most other places that usually only have it until 3pm. The red dragon roll and dynamite roll are to die for. They alsodon't put too much rice on the rolls so you're not filling up on just rice, but can rather taste all the delicious and fresh ingredients.   The 1 and only downside is that there is no shrimp tempura on the AYCE menu, but they have deep fried avocado, which I'd happily take over shrimp, cause it's the bomb.   The staff are also very friendly.  One other tip: do NOT order the chicken teriyaki. It's just not very good, same as most other sushi and bento places. We asked the waiter to please take it back because we didn't like it and he was SO nice and kept apologizing even though we said it was no problem at all and we didn't have to pay for it or anything.   The restaurant itself is super hip and classy. It's just overall a great place. You gotta go here. I've been to a lot of AYCE sushi places around the area and this is one of the top 5 for sure. For this price you really can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch one day as it's close to work. The food was your typical AYCE  quality which was expected. Sushi fell apart the second you picked it up and dishes were bland and flavourless. Again nothing I didn't expect except for the service.   Restaurant wasn't full yet the food came out extremely slow. 30 minutes for 1 roll and a few pieces of sushi to show up. Asked the waitress when we could expect the rest of the food. She told us it all came out already (we ordered enough food to feed a hungry family). We kindly asked for the bill and left."}
{"text":"This place is just a waste of time and space, I'm not even sure how they are still in business (hmmm makes you wonder). My friend and I came Saturday around 3 for AYCE sushi  and here you go :  - The miso soup tatsed like it came out of a packet,  - seaweed salad was freezing cold, which meant it was in the fridge for dayssss - NO sashimi whatsoever on the AYCE menu - all the rolls, nigiri etc were bland and tasteless  - RICE ...RICE ...and more rice ...omg...why is there so much rice on my plate from all these rolls .. - the chicken coconut balls tatsed stale in some parts - I could taste \" the fridge\" on some of the food.   Just I'd never go back ... Not worth even $20 for AyCe lunch"}
{"text":"This is the best place in town for someone who is not a deep guru on sushi and wants all u can eat. Is it the greatest sushi ever? Not really. Do you get really good value with the AYCE menu for lunch? Absolutely. If I am to pick a sushi place in downtown Toronto for a quick cheap filling lunch... this may be it!"}
{"text":"Quite a popular lunch spot with the option to order a la carte or all you can eat. Within a few minutes after being seated, I knew I wasn't coming back here.   There was bright red lipstick on our wine glass. We asked numerous times for water, and when the water did arrive, the waitress waved her hand signaling me to pass the water down the table for her.   We tried almost everything on the all you can eat menu and nothing tasted good. Sushi was falling apart and tempura was stale, the fish in general did not taste fresh.   When I paid in cash for my bill, the waitress pulled out a toonie from her pocket ASSUMING I was actually going to tip her. Excuse me, but I think tipping is at the discretion of the customer based on the type of experience they had... And mine was horrendous.   I would never come back here again, I don't even think they deserve a second chance."}
{"text":"Came here for work lunch AYCE. Not bad for $14.99. Sushi rolls average. But fish cut is good. Enoki beef rolls and tako yaki is good. Not my fave ayce sushi but not bad overall."}
{"text":"I don't know why there's so many bad reviews for this sushi joint. I come here regularly for my salmon sushi fix and it's one of the best sushi places in toronto!   The interior is a bit small. But their sushi is pretty good. I always order the salmon lover.   The server is super nice! It's usually very dead inside so you won't have to wait very long before getting your meal.   4 stars because of parking issues. Expect to walk a bit because you won't find parking in Adelaide if you dine here. Also, those stairs are really steep to walk up to the restaurant ! Really annoying."}
{"text":"I will help this place get the recognition is deserves..  Came here for the $12.99 Lunch buffet today on a random visit, (was actually heading towards an Indian buffet) when we spotted this place in the corner or our eyes.  My friend went inside beforehand to grab an AYCE menu to see what they had to offer. After a scan of the items (pretty typical) we decided to venture in.   As I sat down I took out my trusty Yelp app to see the reviews fellow yelpers gave the place. To my surprise it was only rated at 2.5 stars! I showed my friends the ratings and they were like.. errr.. its a little too late to leave now.. the waitress already brought us our cutlery and tea.. LOL..   anyways whatever.. it was going to be a write off anyway so we didnt expect too much.   We ordered the menu.. the sushi they brought out was pretty fresh.. and they don't give too much rice (which is awesome!) so you dont get full from the carbs. the portion of fish to rice is probably one of the best I've seen compared to other ayce sushi places downtown...   The service was a little bit slow.. but its okay.. we sat at the window which was like 15 yards away from the sushi bar, our poor waitress had to walk back and forth everytime to bring us stuff... but blame the design not the customers :D  Also, the sushi chefs prepare the maki/sushi/specality rolls with a lot of care and great presentation so that may be one of the reasons why the timing may be off. Whatever we were just critical cuase we were hungry :P    the udon soup was nothing great though and very bland, also the sushi pizza and dumplings can get a skip. But overall the sushi experience was very good!  4.6 stars from me. hope they keep it up... will be back someday."}
{"text":"AYCE sushi in the entertainment district. The restaurant has very basic decor and furniture. Didn't appear like they put much thought into it. In regards to food quality, it was mediocre. The sushi rice came out quite warm, the fish quality was just ok and the server did not seem that enthusiastic.  There are better AYCE sushi restaurants in downtown."}
{"text":"probably one of the worst sushi places I've been to. went for AYCE lunch today and the wait for our food was ridiculous. we were a group of 5 and ordered probably about 8 orders of various maki rolls. they brought out 3 orders instantly and didn't bring out the rest for more than half an hour AFTER we complained. 3 orders of 6 rolls each does not go very far with 5 people! maki rolls were loosely rolled and fell apart easily. the salmon roses that we got 40 min after ordering neither looked nor tasted particularly appetizing. after being there for 1 hour and 20 min, we didn't get atleast 3 of our orders and had to leave hungry. would not recommend this place or go back again! food 2/5. service 1/5. presentation 2/5."}
{"text":"Definitely coming back to this place!! The service is quick and the food is quiet good. The price is fair for the portion size and the selection offered.   Visited on a sunday afternoon when only another table and mine were present. The service is quick and the food is quiet good. Not sure how they may be when busy but on a slow day the service is fairly good compared to other restaurants that fall behind when is not busy. The prize is fair in relation to the selection and portion size offered. Didn't feel like server spoke much english however communication was not a big issue.  Also, the location is a big hidden in comparison to the other restaurants in the building. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Pros: * $15 ayce lunch everyday * Nigiri is good * Yam tempura is good * Fast  Cons: * The rolls have waay too much rice * Enoki beef roll is not properly seared"}
{"text":"Pros: -Good All-You-Can-Eat Sushi spot for Monday-Thursday Lunch time. - Fresh food and ingredients. - Wide selection   - Friendly and quick service.  Cons: - Can be understaffed, which slows down service during peak lunch times on busy days such as most fridays"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with coworkers on a Friday afternoon.  First off, I was pleasantly surprised that this sushi restaurant provided wooden reusable chopsticks instead of the usual disposable one! The decor was very clean and simple.   Food menu is fairly large, there are the usual suspects that you would find on a sushi menu. Service speed was ok. We got everything we ordered in good time. A large group of around 20 people came in after us and the service speed significantly dropped once they walked in. Food arrived hot to the table which is a big bonus, I hate when tempura comes to the table cold.  Lunch is cheap at $13.99."}
{"text":"On the spectrum of food places, there are always players that compete on price, and then the rest. To that end, Urawa definitely draws its strengths on price - much cheaper than Yuzu No Hana, To-Ne, Japango and those other less-than-Yasu-but-still-pricey places around the city, but not cheap enough to warrant questions re: potential food poisoning. I've had a diverse selection of maki (i.e. rolls) here - the American Dream roll, Boston roll, Crunchy Beef roll, and then more typical choices such as the sweet potato roll and shrimp roll. They are all A-okay (I like the sweet potato roll quite a bit, though) - not bad at all. I come here often as the delivery is quick to the financial district but apart from the convenience I can't say I have many other reasons for my frequent patronage - some of the special rolls (e.g. American dream) seem to just be variations of the california roll, but I thought they were alright nonetheless :)"}
{"text":"Let's talk about service here for a second. Good service is something that we all desire when we spend our hard earned cash for food that we could make at home, right? I used to be an avid Urawa supporter. Their food is decent and sometimes even very good but after a recent terrible experience, I have realized there are far too many good sushi restaurants in Toronto to waste your money on a place that does not take your business seriously. Let me tell you what happened. My boyfriend and I had been ordering once-three times a week from Urawa because when we find a place we like, we support it. I had received many good, complete meals during delivery but this time absolutely everything was wrong. It was almost as if Urawa had gotten my order and said, \"Let's ignore every single modification on this order just for shits and gigs!\" I received my order and realized that my \"assorted sushi platter\" was literally 100% salmon, (if I had wanted this wouldn't I have ordered the salmon lover?) and my nigiri was missing and replaced with- wait for it - more salmon!! My boyfriends order was also all wrong. I called in to tell them what had happened and they apologized and promised to call me back the following day. I did not receive a call for over 5 days and decided to call back myself. I finally reached someone I believed to be helpful and competent, he again, promised to call me back within 48 hours. Again, no one called me back. So I called again. This time, the girl I spoke to was extremely rude and unhelpful and simply told me no one was there who could help me. I asked her for the hours of the manager and she very reluctantly told me. When I called back during the time provided and said who was calling, the phone was disconnected. Odd coincidence? Maybe. So I called back. This time, the man who picked up was audibly laughing and again, hung up on me. So this is the type of service you will receive from Urawa. People who are rude, do not honor their commitments and people who go as far as laughing right at you before they hang up on you. It would've stung but then I realized that this shit hole would be out of business within a couple of years... Nice job Urawa, when  you fail I won't be surprised one teeny bit. I will never order from Urawa again and I suggest you don't either."}
{"text":"Located at a convenient location in the downtown core (if you're working west of university), Urawa sushi offers both a la carte and all-you-can-eat. They also do delivery through just-eat. For lunch, you can get AYCE for $15. It was quite busy when we went, and food came out quite slowly. We waited 10-15 mins before our first items started to arrive.  In terms of wheelchair accessibility, don't expect much. Walk up a flight of stairs to get to the restaurant. Walk up another flight of stairs to get to the washrooms. Washrooms are pretty small and not impressive.  Some items ended up didn't coming the first time we ordered, so we ended up ordering it again before it showed up.  The menu features some variety of dishes There's sushi, hand rolls, maki rolls, and some fried items. They offered mackerel nigiri, which was a plus since I prefer mackerel over fish such as salmon and tuna. Fish was not bad for AYCE standards though.  Some of the not-so-impressive items I'd have to point out include the vegetable gyoza, vegetable spring rolls, enoki beef rolls, fried scallop, and calamari. I'd just skip those. It seems like others found the enoki beef to be quite delicious, but it didn't stand out to me. The pork cutlet and chicken teriyaki were a bit better, but the chicken came in really tiny and thin pieces.  Their ice cream options are vanilla, green tea, and mango. However, it came REALLY slow. Perhaps they wanted to wait until we were finished with the meal to serve it, but I personally like to have ice cream in between items."}
{"text":"Called ahead and was told they close at 9pm. Arrived at 7:40pm and they tried to deny us service saying they were closed.  It was nearly 1.5 hours prior to closing time. Extremely slow service. Long wair time between items. Extremely small portions. Cut sashimi too small - little cubes. Ayce selection is pretty standard. Sushi was tasty, but not worth the wait. Ordered items that were never made. Told us to re order them. Probably was hoping we didn't notice. Terrible ordering system using scrap pieces of receipt paper.  Strong paint or lacquer odour in restaurant. Won't return."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi. In terms of quality one of the better ones I've had. Really liked their rock shrimp in coconut sauce. All you can eat for comparable price to others."}
{"text":"I went to this place upon the recommendation of a friend.  My bf and I went on a Saturday night and both got the AYCE option.  There was a good variety of sushi, maki rolls, sashimi and appetizers, all for the decent price of $20.99.  I loved the coconut shrimp and the baked mussels were good.  My bf liked their mango roll (I think it's called Fantastic Roll).  The service was good and they refilled our tea often, although we were one of two tables in the restaurant.  I wouldn't say the sashimi is the best I've ever had but I think for the price point it's pretty decent."}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi spot on ubereats. The sushi is always delicious, fresh and filling!   My favourite thing to order is the salmon lovers combo, but the other night I thought I would try a few individual rolls and I was not disappointed. If I am ever in the neighbourhood I definitely will check it out in person!"}
{"text":"MINDBLOWN. Out of all the times I've ordered food I've never had a delivery this bad.  Order was quick to receive from delivery but holy no wonder.   Had the Spicy salmon salad. That was okay.   Eating my salad... I realize there is a small key chain link at the bottom. Okay... I don't get too annoyed. Stuff happens. I had another salad anyway.  Open sashimi.. I had ordered the Sashimi Deluxe.  Unbelievable. For one; only 10 pieces out of the 19. Second: Two pc salmon, 3 pc tiny tiny shrimp, FAKE CRAB, and three thin thin slices of some white fish. And an egg. Which I didn't even realize was egg until the customer service rep who refunded my meal mentioned it.   Honestly, just what?? Zero fucks to be given by this place apparently. I didn't even feel comfortable eating the sushi so I ordered elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place has made a huge turnaround for me -- for the worse. Over the last year I've come several times and each time the quality of food has diminished. This last visit was the last time for me. I went on a weekend lunch for ayce. I found the price has increased yet again. What was even worse was how much rice was used. And even though I removed a ridiculous amount of rice from all the food we had ordered, I was not able to eat the last roll (8 piece special roll that was 2/3 made up of rice). I had once piece and then (so as not to waste the food) I asked if it could be packed up. They do not pack ayce food, so basically a whole roll got thrown out (a complete waste of food, but I guess if it's mostly made up of rice, then no one cares, right?). After this experience I will not be returning. I'm not sure what has changed (management, chef/kitchen staff) but regardless the changes have not been good."}
{"text":"Don't come here. There are so many all you can eat sushi places in Toronto, you can definitely find a better place with better service and servers that actually care about the customers. We checked off all of the items we wanted and were not brought all of them. The server then asked what was missing and we asked him to revert back to the order sheet, since there were multiple people and tons of food options and it was difficult to keep track. The server was confused and had no idea what else we ordered. I complained and the server could clearly care less. Overall, not good. Mediocre food. Bad service. Don't come here."}
{"text":"AYCE dinner is 18.99$. The food was delicious and really good quality for an AYCE. Will definitely come back! The price is hard to beat!!"}
{"text":"I love their special rolls, and the fact that they include avocado and mushroom in the tempura. I was ordering quite frequently from them for a time. Delivery, which was at first great, slowly took longer and longer... Several times we waited over 30 minutes past the 45 minute delivery window with no explanation."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! The service is fast and the food is amazing. Portion sizes are generous so if you're going to eat here make sure you're hungry!"}
{"text":"Came here for a group lunch on a Friday. Service was very slow, and maybe due to the size of our group, many orders were missed. Yes it was good that there was white tuna, but the quality of the fish was only so so."}
{"text":"For the price range-this place is good. Cheapest AYCE in downtown Toronto by far. If you're looking for a cheap, fast, filling meal this is the place to go. For a special exquisite meal, definitely not.  The Good -Price, price, price -Fast service -Fresh fish   The Bad -The sashimi pieces were very small -The rice was warm and kept falling apart for the sushi, annoying but not uneatable -The atmosphere is similar to that of a foodcourt with the beige tables and chairs -The yakitori was uneatable due to the slathering of sauce, definitely don't recommend this dish  Overall, if you're looking to save a buck, give this place a try."}
{"text":"So much yums in one meal! A bunch of coworkers and I came here before the hunger games of May/June - Ramadan! They requested AYCE sushi and even though my stomach can't handle that, I obliged. Happy I did too!  Lots of options on the menu and lots of veggie options!! They even had avocado tempura, which was amazing. I wanted more and more - healthy fats, am I right ;) I loved the avocado sushi, spring rolls and fried dumplings - they were delicious, crisp and fresh. Very not oily because I don't even like oily foods; it was guhhhh.. so amazing. The rest of the rolls were HUGE and the food came very fast.  They did forget a few items but I ain't even complaining because we would've never been able to finish them anyways. Oh, and the washroom upstairs is slightly creepy and gave me demon vibes - lmao, don't ask. I have no idea either!  Dinner price equalled to around $33 with tip .. meh, that's average?"}
{"text":"The all you can eat was for $13.99 for lunch. Good price but yeah, you get what you pay for. The teriyaki (chicken and salmon) were not that great. Sushi was meh. And no shrimp tempura, beef teriyaki or sashimi. Would have been better off paying $25 or $30 at a better AYCE. Totally ruined our lunch date. Not coming back at all."}
{"text":"Bad. You would think a brand new restaurant would have fresh fish but sadly no. Expensive, bad fish, and poor preparation. Ate a few pieces of my meal and threw the rest away because it was horrible. Avoid this place.  Updated note a few hours after eating at this place. Both myself and the person I ate feel sick. Food poisoning. Do not eat here!"}
{"text":"AH-MAZING!  There is no way to better describe this place! This is easily my #1 AYCE Sushi place in all of Toronto, I'm so happy I discovered this little gem! Some of my favourite dishes are the coconut chicken which comes hot and sweet with pineapple chunks, the salmon sashimi, and the beef teriyaki. they have amazingly fresh and hot rolls for you to savour. You will be greeted with kind/fast service and amazing food. I've brought almost all my friends here because it's actually that fresh, fast and perfectly priced.   YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"4 stars based on fresh buttery salmon and white tuna, fantastic miso soup, on of the best I ever had and I had great before. Also had the Katsu Pork, good. Left very pleased."}
{"text":"The Crazy Roll ordered from the special rolls menu was okay ar best, and the portion was on the small side.  P.S. Somebody please ask them to bleach the tea cups!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. My friends and I came in for AYCE dinner on a Thursday night. The restaurant was empty except for us and two other tables. Per person dinner was 16.99 + tax and 10% tip = ~$20.   The service was alright. Once or twice we had to remind the waiters to get our orders. The food was alright as well. Miso soup only had the miso and nothing else. It was very salty. Try their house roll - it is delicious! However, the quality of the maki was only okay; they could have been neater. Nothing special, just your typical sushi restaurant - EXCEPT THE UNBEATABLE PRICE!! Green tea ice cream was good. The sushi pizza the yaki tori were pretty good. Also can't go wrong with spicy salmon and salmon and avocado rolls. Although everything might've tasted alright to us because we were all hungry. The edamame was bad. Do not get the edamame.   I'd probably come here again with friends for some cheap AYCE but if I'm not that hungry I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Impressed. They seem to have gotten over their opening teething problems. The AYCE menu seems, as best I can figure, only available after 5 pm. It's $20 + change. The sashimi features nice thickly cut hunks of salmon. Delish.   I'd make it 5 stars but have to knock them back a star. Like many AYCE places, what you tick off on the order sheet is not always what you get. There was an intriguing \"pepper salmon\" on the sashi section that took us two tries to get to the table. Had to order octopus twice to get it to the table. Big ups for the pepper salmon, however. The outside of rubbed with some pepper, the outside is quickly braised ahi tuna style, and then sliced."}
{"text":"This place has become a lunch staple for me. Since my last review I've gone an additional four times, and I've had a great meal every time.   Can't beat the price, and everything is fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, quick service, for a very reasonable price (all you can eat). Food is good, so a nice place to hang out at to eat Japanese! The entrance can be a little bit tricky tho haha."}
{"text":"Came here one Saturday before going out to drink. The restaurant itself is okay looking - clean and spacious. We decided to order AYCE for dinner since it is only $16.99 which is a really great price for AYCE.   The bad: -The sushi rice was warm! All of it! I am surprised that no one else mentioned this. So whenever we tried to pick up a maki roll piece or sushi with chopsticks, the rice would just fall apart easily since it was so soft and mushy. Just so everyone knows, this is not how sushi rice should be.   -Way too high of a rice ratio. This was unpleasant especially considering that all the sushi rice we were served was warm and falling apart.  -Tempura batter was thick and mushy and uncooked around the shrimp. I believe the shrimp was sliced in half because it was oddly thin. Kind of unpleasant.  -Service was so slow. There was maybe 5 tables in the restaurant at the time and waitress was not friendly or inviting at all. Each order (except for seaweed salad or miso soup) took at least 15 minutes to arrive. Shrimp tempura took about 20 minutes which seems crazy for tempura.  -Cooked dishes - all tasted bad to mediocre   The good: -Seaweed salad was nice and dressed properly.    -The raw salmon was actually quite fresh  -Cheap dinner. You have to compromise a lot for quality though and quite frankly, it's not worth it. Would have preferred to spend a few extra bucks and went somewhere else, even if it's not AYCE."}
{"text":"Okayish sushi. Don't go when it's busy around lunchtime. They can't handle the workload and the quality of their rolls goes to shit."}
{"text":"This place is the best gor those of you who work downtown. Try to get there before 12pm and order fast...there's only 1-2 taking the orders and at times it's packed.  Grest sushi, very fresh so don't listen to some of the reviews posted mentioning how stale the food is...IT ISN'T! i go there at least once a week and Fridays are the busiest.  Order the adelaide roll, super salmon roll , spicy salmon roll, coconut chicken, dynamite roll, salmon pizza   It's only $18 tax and tip included for AYCE lunch."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi or AYCE. Just do your self a favor save your 30$ (price for two) and go somewhere else. Fish isn't fresh enough. Rice to fish ratio isn't right. The taste is fishy and even cucumbers inside rolls tasted wired. I don't know I would rather dumpster dive than come back for sushi here. Pardon for harsh review but something must change! Ice cream was good ;)"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved everything I ordered. First time eating from this place, ordered in through ubereats. I was a little bit skeptical because it was not my go to sushi place but wow I was sooooo happy!!!! I ordered the Salmon Lovers platter, shrimp tempura roll and Japanese spring rolls... every element was great, quality of fish was great and the food was very fresh. Definitely will be eating from here again!! Would recommend 100%"}
{"text":"Very nice and friendly staff upon walking in, but this may have just been because we were the only two customers there on a Friday dinner. Friday AYCE dinner was a normal price ($21.99 / person). Here are a few things I ordered:  Miso (4/5) Literally tasted like all other delicious miso soups around the city. Nothing special, but I'm a huge miso fan.  Crab stick sushi (5/5) Too good. Just the right amount of rice for the piece of crab. I could have eaten 20.  Cheese wontons (2.5/5) It didn't really taste like cream cheese in the middle like I was hoping for. They were okay.  Spicy salmon roll (2.5/5) Tasted okay.  Coconut chicken (5/5) My first experience eating coconut chicken and it was the best. Comes with a few chunks of pineapple on the plate, too. Definitely recommend this dish.  Thai chicken (3/5) It was a little cold. Sauce wasn't spicy enough. It was eatable, though.  A good vibe overall and the music was killing it for a sushi restaurant. But all the food wasn't quite up to par, unfortunately."}
{"text":"I honestly have ZERO idea how this place has this low of an average. $14 CAD for lunch all you can eat and $17 CAD for dinner all you can eat is maybe the best deal in downtown Toronto. The food comes out fast but fresh, the menu is extensive, and they do not skimp on the sushi pieces.   This is a small place run entirely by a family and it feels really good to go there and support this restaurant. Give this place a shot. I guarantee it'll be worth it!"}
{"text":"Arrived around 12:15 pm today & the restaurant was 1/3 full so no issues in grabbing a seat.  Although when I first walked in, nobody really attended to me, so I had to walk to the back where their register is, to look for someone to ask for a table for two.  The waitress was very friendly and said I could take the table by the window.  We ordered the following from their $12.99 AYCE lunch menu and I rate them out of 5 as follows:  Miso Soups, 2 bowls (4/5) Seaweed Salads, 2 bowls (5/5)  Red Dragon Roll, 8 pieces (4/5) Dynamite Roll, 8 pieces (4/5) Calfornia Rolls, 4 pieces (5/5) Salmon Rolls, 4 pieces (4/5) Crunch Rolls, 4 pieces (4/5))  Fried Scallop, 2 pieces (5/5) Dumplings, 2 pieces (5/5) Chicken Teriyaki, 2 skewers (2/5), DRIED OUT AS HECK Coconut Chicken, 1 plate (5/5), VERY GOOD Eel on Rice, 1 plate (3/5), just meh.  Red Bean ice cream (3/5), not the best I've had  I'm not sure if its because we we're taking our time to eat it, but the sushi got warm & soggy really fast which made it unpleasant to eat after a while.  And I've never really experienced that before, hence the overall 3/5 rating.  Waitress came around and filled up our green teas frequently.  The food came out fast. Although there is a disclaimer saying they will charge for uneaten food, we had four pieces of sushi remaining for which they did not charge us.  Atmosphere is modern, chic, and clean.  Oh, but as a short girl, it was uncomfortable to sit on the tall banquette side of the table.  =S  I read bad reviews here on Yelp about the Chicken Teriyaki, and Dumplings so I was tempted to try it even more.  Spot on re: the Chicken Teriyaki, but the Dumplings were absolutely delicious.  Nice and crunchy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside.  Likewise with the fried scallop.  I would definitely give this place another go.  Probably eat faster next time to avoid warm, soggy sushi.  =S"}
{"text":"*THIS REVIEW IS ONLY ABOUT THEIR DELIVERY*  As I am a generally lazy person, making dinner is usually the last thing on my mind. Urawa Sushi had really high ratings on justeat so my friend and I decided to just go for it. We ordered a sushi platter for 2, which came to around $30. For delivery, you needed to buy a minimum of $20 and also give the driver a tip of either $1, $3, $7 or $10. On the website Urawa Sushi said they would deliver within an hour.  40 minutes later, the driver brought the sushi to my apartment and had a nice and friendly attitude. I gave him the money and opened up the package to reveal that they had given us FREE dragon rolls! What a thoughtful gesture!  The sushi platter for 2 had generous servings of rolls and nigiri sushi. The dragon roll was rather tiny, but a good size considering that it was free! As this is a place that serves AYCE sushi, the quality is not what you would expect from a Michelin 3-Star restaurant, but rather a restaurant with filling sushi for your starving stomach."}
{"text":"I came back here early last week and ordered mostly hand rolls and the usual coconut chicken which I like so much. The first round they served was good but on the second order, they forgot to add spicy may to two of my hand rolls.  Normally, this wouldn't be much of an issue and I would have just ordered spicy may on the side. The problem is, those who frequent this establishment know that the spicy variety of rolls and hand rolls are prepared differently. They are chopped up which makes the overall taste and experience quite different. I actually prefer the fish chopped up/diced. So aside from that, the meal was decent.  I'm keeping my original rating just because the hand rolls still tasted good despite the minor setback."}
{"text":"There is too much rice in the rolls, 75% rice to 25% filling. Not seasoned enough and it's too hard.  Teppanyaki is okay. Tempura is crunchy.  Decor is nice but food is lacking unfortunately."}
{"text":"If you want the dinner menu that includes sashimi, it's actually $22 instead of $19.   All of their sushi components had a lot of rice and very little fish. Of course most all you can eat places give you more rice but this place is just ridiculous. It is an outlier compared to the norm in terms of fish and rice ratio. Very stingy in the amount of food given.   I have been to a lot of sushi places, this would be one that I will never go back."}
{"text":"I've never eaten...uh stuff, that was so bad that I was terrified to touch it. The only thing that was alright was the pickled ginger since it cleaned up my mouth. I can't believe you can serve this to your customers. Something's gotta change. Procuring better quality of the fish and getting the rice right would be a start."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and atmosphere. I went in for AYCE lunch just as they opened on a Sunday afternoon. I was greeted warmly and chose a window spot. I was promptly served a delicious cup of green tea.  Miso soup was hot and had the right amount of \"kick\". Rolls were fresh and the variety was excellent.  I enjoyed my visit so much I'm taking my friends there today!"}
{"text":"Just ok. Had seafood udon and a rainbow roll. The seafood tasted almost like it had been sitting out for a while. The sushi was nothing special. I'll be in no hurry to return."}
{"text":"Ordered a 60 dollar tray online and half of the rolls were veggie. Minimal variety of fish."}
{"text":"Ordered with UberEats and really enjoyed my lunch. I got the Tuna Lovers platter. $25 was worth all that sushi! & it comes with a miso soup and salad. Definitely worth it, the quality was great. Would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"When the imitation crab meat tastes like an imitation of imitation crab...  DELIVERY REVIEW: via UberEATS  I've ordered a few times from Urawa now, and my final conclusion is that yes, it's very budget-friendly. BUT, you get what you pay for (and that's fake crab meat which counts as pieces of sashimi.)  The Good: - Fast food preparation (delivery times on both Foodora and UberEATS are less than 30 minutes for downtown region)  The OK: - The spicy scallop roll was decent and the rice to filling ratio was fair  The Bad: - $22.25 for a \"Sashimi Deluxe\" which was described as \"19 pieces of sashimi.\" Since when did imitation crab or tamago count as sashimi?!  If you must order, I would stick to their rolls. I've also heard decent things about their salmon lover combo and tuna lover combo, but I've given Urawa too many chances now and we're officially over.   Urawa, we are never ever ever getting back together."}
{"text":"This ayce sushi place was such a deal in Toronto city centre. The miso soup was a very traditional kind and very tasty. Sushis and sashimis were fresh and delicious with generous portions. Staff were friendly and attentive. Lastly we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the mango and green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"As an almost daily consumer of sushi in Vancouver, I was pleasantly surprised by Urawa. My expectations for sushi in Toronto aren't high but Urawa's AYCE lunch special is seriously good value. I'll be back."}
{"text":"My friend and I really wanted to go to PAI but it was super super busy. The second option was sushi and there wasn't that many choices in the financial district and we were pretty starving. My friend found this place from google and we decided to try it.   The place was completely quiet, it was just us and another couple hidden in the corner. The only time that the door opened, which was like every five minutes was from foodora or uber eats orders.   This place was classic. Paper menu. A little bit pricier than some places I've been to but we were starving. There wasn't much on their menu so it wasn't worth the price tag. The thing that stood out to me that was super amazing was their sushi salmon pizza. It was delicious. I don't understand the ordering system at all. Some of the stuff would say one piece but then more than one piece would arrive at our table....   Their miso soup and seaweed salad was okay. There was no tofu, seaweed or green onions in their miso soup. That was the first time I had plain broth. Their spider roll was alright. It tasted like the crab wasn't freshly fried and a bit stale which was super disappointing because I was so excited that a place like this had it. Their shrimp tempera had way too much batter and  there was a lot of fried tempera veggies, it's like they disregarded our order and put more pieces just to fill us up. First time that I actually had fried slice carrots, not too bad. The fried sweet potatoe was amazing as usual. It was still piping hot and so yummy.   Their dragon roll was delicious and super filling! I liked their baked mussels. If you don't like mayo, do not order it! The chicken teriyaki was okay, the chicken skewers were better!   Service was okay, the waitress didn't constantly check up on us. My friend kept waiting for water and our tea was cold when we got them.   This place was OKAY. Some of their stuff was a hit and a miss but I don't think we'll be coming back here. For that price, there's better all you could eat sushi places on Queen Street. If you want a quick fix for sushi, do come here. It will satisfy your cravings but don't come here with high expectations!   Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"I do take-out every week from this place.  They make fantastic food.  My issue is that they are terrible on the phone.  They don't speak English well (not such a problem normally) but they don't have ordering online to make up for it and it is PAINFUL EVERY TIME!  Please make an online ordering system or use what is out there.  I am going to have to switch because it is just that annoying.  But keep doing everything the same with the food.  it is the best!"}
{"text":"I love sushi and I usually go for Sushi lunch on Thursdays.I like to try new places  and we accidentally discovered Urawa sushi while we were going to a sushi place on Queen West. 14 bucks for All You Can Eat!!!Yes Pleeezzzz!! It is a small nice place and very clean.  They did not have sashimi though on their menu and even sushi and handroll choices are very very limited. The sushi was decent although I felt it had more rice,less fish and was rolled very loosely. Do try their chicken breast,spring rolls and coconut chicken if you are doing All You Can Eat.Sushi Pizza was decent too. I might go there again only because its cheap."}
{"text":"I had the chance to visit this AYCE Sushi restaurant multiple times in the span of 1 year.  I have to say that I really like the dining experience here.  If you're looking for a fancy place,  this is not it...  However if you look for a good sashimi and sushi fix...  Bingo! You found it!  I simply LOVE their pepper salmon sashimi that is basically seared on top and raw inside.  Mmm delicious!  Their choice of rolls and sushi is not extensive but it can be somewhat unique and different than other places.  I would not recommend anything else than sushi and sashimi.  The other cooked dishes are simply mediocre and have a blend flavour that doesn't impress.  Also one other bothering aspect is that they don't offer fountain drinks that makes me really upset because I think coke zero or diet  coke on fountain should be standard in any restaurant  :).   Overall a 3 stars sushi restaurant that can easily improve and go to 4 if they did the minor issues.   Happy sushi!!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Friday and it was very busy. We waited about 10 minutes, as almost all tables seat 4 and there were usually 2 people per table. We ordered some of the usual -- salmon and tuna sushi, a few rolls, calamari, sweet potato tempura, etc. The fish tasted fine, though you can tell that it was recently thawed since it still had a slight taste of ice. The fish cut is a little odd, rectangular, but I guess that means you get more fish per piece. For a $14 lunch, it's a good deal. We also had ice cream at the end. The choices were red bean and green tea, as well as banana tempura, which was soggy battered banana."}
{"text":"Terrible. We only received 60% of the number of dishes we ordered. And we ordered a reasonable number of dishes. Dishes came out at a snails pace. An hour and a half later most of our party is still hungry. For $13.99 all you can eat, I'd rather have gone somewhere where I could have had a full meal. Sorry, Urawa, not coming back."}
{"text":"I ordered from here with UberEats on one night. What I love the most about the menu is that it's not only huge, but the Tuna/Salmon lovers choice on there is really awesome & genius. Order both & share with someone & you guys will be very satisfied. We ordered a bunch of sushi -- all good."}
