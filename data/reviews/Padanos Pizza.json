{"text":"It is a hole in the wall in St. Joseph and they really make great food. The Chicago style pizza is wonderful with plenty of sauce on the top. The salads are good as well and much better than other nearby restaurants (which are really just shredded lettuce)."}
{"text":"Padanos makes great pizzas all around with better flavor and more toppings than most other places in the area. Make sure to try the Deluxe. It's the best pizza I've had in East Central IL. Definitely worth the drive out from Champaign-Urbana."}

{"text":"Padanos Pizza, where do I start?  I personally love the sandwiches.  They have incredible gyros with an awesome homemade pita that reminds me of naan.  Their Italian beef with Au Jus is excellent.  Chicken bacon ranch sandwich is a favorite of the SO and worth the wait.  A secret menu item ... french fries.  Perfectly seasoned and crispy.  My kids love the pizza and the cheesey cheesey pizza is a great garlic sauce based pizza that is definitely unusual and filling.  This little hole in the whole pizza place is an excellent hidden treasure in St Joseph and they deliver so its great for those nights that I don't want to cook.  I have always had excellent service and the owner and staff are great at suggesting new items to try. Also, the deep dish pizza is well worth the hour wait and the closest thing here in Central Illinois to a little taste of Chicago!   The store hours, for those who aren't' familiar, are open for lunch M-F during the school year and after 430 p.m. during the evening."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Limited choice of beverages. Very nice customer service. Owner was good to talk to while eating a quick dinner while Traveling through the area."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! My favorite pizza by far! Cheese bread is excellent as well! Don't miss this hidden gem. Authentic deliciousness placed in a box. I order a pizza every single time I'm in the area! Absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Well worth the stop driving on our way back to Ohio. The Chicago-style pizza was amazing, and we had great service."}
{"text":"Fresh, hot and delicious!  We've been frequenting this great pizza and sandwich shop for many years and I can't say enough good things about it!  It's a no frills kind of place with limited seating areas.  We usually just pick it up but in a pinch ask for home delivery.  The Italian sausage and tomato sauce are da bomb!  Our favorite oven baked subs are the Chicken Bacon Ranch and Sicilian Supreme.  The bacon on the CBR is so yummy and I wish I could buy the bread for my own home sandwiches!  The kitchen is tiny and if they are busy it may take time so call ahead!  The owner and his staff go out of their way to make sure everything is JUST the way we like it!  The owner supports many community groups and is always willing to help when needed."}
