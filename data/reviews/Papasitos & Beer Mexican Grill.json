{"text":"New favorite Mexican restaurant, such an amazing night here! The patio is absolutely gorgeous and we had freshly made guac made right in front of us that was the best guacamole I've had compared to any other Mexican restaurant around. The atmosphere is great and the people there could not be nicer. We got the fresh guac and tacos for taco Tuesday and they were delicious. I highly recommend this place and already can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I think the food is wayyy better since the new management. Great service. Keep up the good work. I will definetly be back again."}
{"text":"So far, not good.  The menus are sticky. The tables around us are unbused and the staff seems completely disinterested in working.  It took three trips to the table for our server to get us water. No one seems to have any direction.  Maybe dinner will be better... Negative, fajitas were cold and had almost no flavor.  I'm not picky, I just want warm food and something that has more flavor than hospital food.  My $9 margarita, was unimpressive as well. Oh well, you live you learn."}
{"text":"My god. What a dump. I wanted to tell everyone walking in that this was a joke . Food, service and bugs all awful . The entire meal was just a pathetic attempt at trying to be a restaurant"}
{"text":"Food was not good. They don't ask how you like it because they probably already know. No one at our table ate their meal and we didn't want to take it with us. It didn't prompt them to ask if there was a problem. Waste of $$$. I definitely do not recommend it."}
{"text":"Great people great food, great prices. For Ohio this place is really good. Coming from CA, and AZ my family is spoiled. However this place is great!"}
{"text":"The patio seating and lake view is the only saving grace of this place.  The service is impossibly slow.  We had to set up our own table to eat because it hadn't been bussed properly and the hostess didn't help.  Good thing I'm a mom and not afraid to pitch in and get things done!  Food was good--no issues there, but we had to had to wait so long for everything-drinks, chips, etc.  Worst part was we waited from 8:54 to 9:15 just to get the check.  We wanted to leave-definitely couldn't!  We were a party of five so not too many people and our orders were off the menu, not complicated.  I think they were way understaffed and not well prepared for a large holiday (July 4) weekend crowd.  Too bad.  Huge missed opportunity to make a great impression."}
{"text":"This place is obviously under new management. Our meals were bland, cold & overcooked. Place needs a makeover. Nice location. Service was adequate. I suffered a bout gastro intestinal distress for two days. That generally does it for me."}
{"text":"After hearing the name change and seeing the other \"okay\" yelp reviews we figured to give this place a try. This is only getting one star because the salsa was decent and you can't give the review zero. The service is very slow and our waiter had no idea about the items on the menu. When he was specifically asked what each item was all he could say was I think and when the food came out it was all the wrong stuff nothing like he described. We ordered a side of queso cheese for our chips and it was so runny but I would not even stay on the chip. The food was not good at all there was supposed to be cheese on the item of food that I was given but it was so runny you would have no idea it was even there, there was green salsa as well but I don't know if that was on the plate or not. After about 3 bites into the food (which had no flavor what-so-ever) a baby millipede came crawling out of my pile of salad and onto my napkin. We had to go to the hostess for assistance because the waiter never came to check on us and there was no one else around, we asked her for the manager who again took forever so we had the hostess look at the bug before it ran off. Finally he came and acted like okay so what, then I believe it was the owners brother who came over to help us out. We never ate another bite and will not return this guy was a good help apologized, took care of our bill and gave us a 20% off discount for our next visit however won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"Great day to enjoy lunch at Papasito's Restaurant! A small group of us, gurls, got to sit on patio & enjoy great Mexican food on outdoor patio, overlooking beautiful Lake Erie, with PERFECT weather 73Â°!! As we all know, hospitality is half the pleasure of dining out! Well, our server, Michael, was THE perfect person to fill this role. Michael was friendly, amusing & very attentive, refilling our drinks as soon as they got low! Excellent job! Our food orders were taking just a little longer than he liked, so he brought us \"complimentary\" guacamole & white cheese sauce with extra tortilla chips! Everyone was quite pleased with their food. I, myself, had a shrimp chimichanga, filled with plump shrimp sitting on a bed of grilled green peppers & onions. This dish was served with great rice, beans (which ALL Mexican restaurants insisting on blending them so beans have dissipated!) and a nice salad with guacamole & sour cream. Papasito's serves an excellent raspberry iced tea! #SatisfiedCustomer"}
{"text":"Just reopened with new owners, family that has Las Cazuelas in Avon Lake.  Menu very similar. Eating outside with lake view cannot be beat. Service and food was great but we had few problems on food order.  But one can expect this being opened only a week.  We plan on making the drive over again and enjoying a dinner on the lake."}
{"text":"Have been there twice since the new management. Best two meals I have ever had at that place. The shrimp for the tacos are huge and fresh. The carnitas burrito was delish! Servers very attentive."}
{"text":"Good service good food. My son is autistic sand he was a little loud at first, but he told them what he wanted and they put it in immediately and let him keep the menu because it was entertaining him and keeping him calm. And the food was so good. I enjoyed myself thoroughly. It's not often I get to enjoy going out to eat."}
