{"text":"Came here for drinks with a couple friends on a Thursday night. I wanted to like this place more than I did because it's a great location and the atmosphere inside is really nice - a good place to meet friends for drinks while being fancy enough for a nice date night. But I think the service and drinks we received left a lot to be desired.   I was the first of my friends to arrive and asked for a table for three. The waitress asked if we would be ordering food and I said we'd probably just order drinks. She then asked me if I wanted a table for three or if I'd prefer to sit at the bar. There was literally only one other table in the entire restaurant and no one at the bar. I was catching up with some friends and sitting all next to each other at a bar can make for some awkward conversation holding so I said I'd prefer a table if that was alright. I made sure to ask if it was okay if we had a table if we were just ordering drinks and the waitress assured me it was okay.   So I sit down at a table, my friend arrives, we order some drinks. My friend ordered one of their craft gin and tonic cocktails and I ordered a paloma. We weren't necessarily wowed by our drinks, especially for the price point but they were fine. Nothing amazing but I felt like I expected more since you're paying $9-12 for a cocktail. Another friend arrives, we order another round. Our waitress was giving us weird, passive aggressive vibes during a lot of our interactions (I thought it was just me because I had such a weird seating experience with her but my other friends confirmed that the service was pretty awkward) and then, while all of us are still halfway through our second drink, our waitress comes up to us and asks us if we need more drinks. We say we're okay for now and then she asks if we want our check. All of us are a little surprised, because honestly the place was not crowded. There was no one else seated at the tables and there were seven or so people at the bar. I would totally understand being rushed out if it was crowded and we were just taking up space. But we were literally halfway through our drinks. Anyway, we finished the drinks off, paid and headed off to Genna's. The whole experience left me with a weird taste in my mouth - I still might return to try the food one day just to try it but I'm not necessarily trying to rush back to this place, which is a shame."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place. The burger sounded fabulous and was cooked perfectly but was extremely salty. Also the shallots overwhelmed my palate. My husband wanted the pork belly but that was all sold out so he opted for the steak sandwich. The steak was super tender and delicious but again the onions were a little harsh. I would've actually given this place 4 stars but unfortunately the service was absolutely terrible. We could tell the waitress wasn't happy about being there... We enjoyed our meal but she never came back to ask if we liked it even though the place didn't look very busy. Most of the people were at the bar and were being taken care of by the bartender. We waited, and waited, and waited. Literally a minimum of 20 min passed AFTER we finished eating before my husband finally went up to her and asked for our check. She practically threw it on the table when we got it. Then, as we were leaving, I could hear her complaining that another group was arriving to eat. Yes it was kind of late but it was a Friday night in Madison so not sure what she expected."}
{"text":"I'm giving it two stars for the cocktails and liquor, which were great. Excellent and wide selection of whiskeys, especially for Madison. Mixed cocktails were attended to with concentration. Unfortunately, air conditioning was out in the restaurant, and it was kind of miserable to be in there. We hung on, but our server did not, spending a good deal of time outdoors \"talking with an old friend\" we were told. Hmmm. By the point that we were the only patrons left in the place, she should have been paying attention to *us* instead.   Food was a disaster. Limited menu, the meat and cheese boards were laughably meager and poorly constituted. Seriously, in Wisconsin?! We left for another restaurant, ordered their cheese board and burst out laughing when it showed up overflowing with 5 times the selection and serving.   Like others, I wanted to like this place. Great space, great concept. Execution is really lacking right now. Shore up the food (or get rid of it!) and service, and find some experienced table help soon! Otherwise, I'm afraid, people are going to stay away in droves."}
{"text":"Came in here for cocktails and dinner on a Thursday night. The food, drinks, and service were phenomenal. The cocktail and drink list is expansive  and our server helped us select ones that worked best for our tastes. We tried a few unique and artisanal cocktails and they were all great. We got salads and small plates to share and it was all delicious! Generous portions and it was clear a lot of attention and detail was put towards each dish. The service was very attentive and personable, really made us feel welcome. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Drinks are strong and yummy! The bone-in pork was to-die-for.  Staff is extremely friendly and attentive.  Portions were generous. A must visit for Madison."}
{"text":"I've visited three times now and they have all been disappointing. I really want a place to do well in this location! I'm only giving it two stars because the staff is friendly. For a whiskey bar the selection of whiskey needs work, it looks like a distributor offloaded on them for a discount. Last night it was extremely warm inside the restaurant to the point where I was very excited to leave. I ordered a daiquiri to start and it was awful. They went overboard on the simple syrup by a lot. I tasted my friends signature cocktail and we both agreed it was dissapointing. Then our server came over and announced 3-4 dishes on the menu were modified or unavailable including what I was interested in. They did have a special steak sandwich that many at our table ordered but I didn't hear any positive comments.  All in all the extra warm room really made it feel like they were already struggling and the daiquiri was kinda the nail in the coffin. I will visit sometime again after they have a few more months. Hopefully these are just startup issues."}
{"text":"Wow- Great service, great food, great drinks! I can't decide which was the best part. We were instantly greeted, seated, and our coats were hung for us. The Mad-town Riblit was absolutely delicious. The bread was perfectly toasted while the pulled pork inside packed flavor. We had spot-on drink recommendations based on our likes. Also, the vibe was relaxing and comfortable with good music. We will defiantly be back soon!"}
{"text":"Terrific ambience. We were greeted warmly by the owner who seated us immediately. Our server, Sarah could not have been better. Fun, professional and attentive.   We had several of their cocktails and their bourbon list cannot be matched in the area. If you're even remotely serious about whiskey, you owe yourself a trip to Boar and Barrel. We will 100% be back, soon."}
{"text":"This neat bar opened just this month! Across the street from the Bartell Theatre, it's a great before-or-after drink place if you're seeing a show. The look inside is beautiful. A bit industrial-feeling, with the exposed rock and wood/metal chairs. The staff are very nice and a lot of fun to talk to.   While they are not serving food quite yet (I believe they officially begin on April 1st), I was able to get a little preview from the chef. The chef is incredibly kind and his food is AMAZING. Everything I tried was delicious and I kept going back for more. I hope all the samples he had end up on the menu!   They have a specialty cocktail menu, along with a full bar. Here's the bad part -- all of their drinks (even bottled beer) are very expensive. About $9 for a cocktail and even $8 for a bottle of New Glarus. In addition to that, they were making their drinks *very* boozy. And not in a good way! To the point where they were undrinkable. We gave this feedback to one of the staff and she said she would pass it on to the bartender, so let's hope things even out a little.   Overall, I would visit this place again for their food. Not sure that I would seek it out for drinks because of the prices."}
{"text":"I went to B&B on Saturday night for a night cap with 3 other people. The first thing we noticed upon entering the bar was how extremely hot it was inside. It was about 80 degrees outside, and somehow it was HOTTER in the bar! It was so unbelievably uncomfortable that we almost didn't stay. Other than being extremely hot, the bar was very nice. It was cozy and inviting. The bartenders were SO welcoming and very friendly. We spent quite a bit of time just chatting with them, they were very fun. Now this next part, I will take some of the blame for, for not looking at a menu/prices before ordering. However, I knew I wanted a sparkling or regular rose' of some kind. I told this to the bartender and he seemed to know exactly what to give me, so one of my friends and I both took him up on the recommendation. He handed us both a mini bottle (single serving) of a very tasty sparkling rose' with a cool little spout to drink it out of. My 2 other friends each ordered an  old fashioned (which they said were very good). When it came time to cash out for the 4 drinks, the bartender told us our total.... and I nearly fell off my bar stool. $71!!! For 4 drinks!!!!! Now it was definitely my mistake for not asking the bartender how much the drink he wanted to serve me was going to cost. But I never in a million years would have thought that one rose' would cost $25! I had a much better sparkling rose' at Eno Vino that same night for $13... thus adding to my shock. Again, I acknowledge my part in this lack of communication, but I like taking a bartender's recommendation, and I've never had it backfire this badly before. Honestly, I probably won't ever go back there... I just personally didn't enjoy it enough to justify the cost, not to mention the stifling heat (seriously, what is up with that?) That being said, I'm sure this bar may be someone else's cup of tea. Very expensive and very hot tea."}
{"text":"Came into town from San Francisco, went on a date downtown. Walked around capital square and saw this little joint, peeked inside.  Staff was very friendly, decor was historic and well-appointed.   We each ordered a cocktail that was well made, I could tell it was fresh ingredients. Sometimes cocktails taste a bit college-y (is that a word?) in a college town, but not at all here. We had a Manhattan and a Paper Plane (very citrusy, tasty).  Ambiance was lively, and if we didn't have dinner plans would have stayed for the fare. We'll definitely be back and would make it a stop if you're in Madison."}
{"text":"This new establishment has been on my radar since March as I am at Bartell Theatre frequently.  I had an opportunity to try it the other day.  The inside of the restaurant is the on-trend: white washed walls and rich wood bar.  The wall behind the bar is covered with bottles of whiskey, scotch, and other libations.  There are several tables and high tops.  It could get very crowded very fast.  There were two gents behind the bar and one front of house staff.  She was the hostess and server.  She was thoughtful to my party not wanting the high top tables and let us move two small tables together.  My mom and I got there before my other guest and started with their signature Old Fashioned.  The drink was very good and had a \"dirty cherry\".  The cherry was infused with alcohol and quite a tasty treat.   I am starting a project at home now...  We got the cheese plate and it was three types of cheese.  A cherry reduction and toast points accompanied the cheese.  It was a lovely starter.  When my third party arrived, we ordered.  The menu is smaller than most restaurants in this neighborhood but it is very thoughtful.  My mother had the Bone In Pork Porterhouse.  She felt it was cooked very well.   There was some confusion about a missing Endive Salad that was listed on the description of the Porterhouse.  The manager got it cleared up after a bit.   I had the Palak Paneer.  This Indian dish was a nice veggie option and had good flavor (but not spicy). I would get it again.   And my other guest had the Diver Scallops.  They were large, beautiful scallops.  They were very tasty.  As this spot irons out it's opening, I can see many nice things happening.  It's good for drinks and a small concentrated menu.  It is not, at this point, a place for desserts.  I hope to give them another try in the near future."}
