{"text":"Seems like these steamed \"hot pot\" is becoming popular in recent year so I decided to give Captain S a go. Went there on a Saturday night and I was the first one there (5:30pm). Left close to 9pm (yeah I stayed there for a loooong time) and I counted a total of 10 occupied tables including mine so not the most packed places of all, which is understandable given the hefty price tag on their menu/combo.   Customer service is good for the most part, but mainly because they don't give you instructions on how many minutes in the optimal cooking time for the seafood. Guess they want to do everything for you so you eat quickly and leave.  Be prepared to pay $60 per person and have a great seafood meal (end with congee). Personally I wouldn't go again due to the price and the lack of options."}
{"text":"The seafood we had was not fresh enough to be steamed and eat directly. We were food poisoned... Had a stomachache for hours right after we finished the dinner. Will definitely not come back again. BE CAREFUL AND THINK TWICE!!!"}
{"text":"I guess all these steam tables have somehow replaced hotpot, as I am seeing more and more of these opening up in Markham. Came here for a family dinner last week because they wanted to eat healthy after the holidays.  The menu consist of different combos with a variety of items from the à la carte but minimum order had to be 2 orders (almost $30 per combo per person) so almost $60 for 2. However, there was 5 of us, our server suggested we order 5 combos, but we wanted to try the minimum order with 2 combos first, because not everyone in my family likes seafood too much.  My honest opinion: 3 combos would be perfect for 5 people and order some à la carte items like veggies, steamed pork dumplings, and the stone pot pork bone congee that they start cooking underneath the steam tray and served after all seafood has been steamed. Great idea with the \"steaming\" and healthy aspect of eating food made in front of you, however, it would be nice if the restaurant had more side dishes on the menu and dessert could incorporate some healthy aspect in it as well, and not use ice-cream which wasn't quite appealing. I'm guessing because this place is still new, there's still room for improvement."}
{"text":"Customer service was top notch.  The food was fresh.  Check out the photos I posted.  Food was delicious.  U can watch your food cook in front of u.  Although it's optional, u really should get an order of congee or soup as all the seafood juice from all the steaming is released into the pot where the congee or soup is located below the steam tray.  The clams & congee was my favorite part.  Will return.  Super friendly service.  This restaurant just opened this week."}
{"text":"Cool concept, but pricey for Asian food. Combo A is normally $60 a person. If it's a white place, then the price is expected, especially since they cook it for u. But it's downstairs of a big Chinese crab/seafood restaurant. So for the same price, I can get a table full of seafood and not just a bite of each.    There was an app that have us a good discount, ended up $31/person for the cheapest combo. We were scared the wasn't enough food and we would need to go eat a burger afterwards. But at the end, they give u enough veggies, siu long bao, chicken, and the come that made us full.   It would be better if they also allowed more a la carte items so we can decide what we wanted. My parents doesn't like shellfish so he sat for family while."}
