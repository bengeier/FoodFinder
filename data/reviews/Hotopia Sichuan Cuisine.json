{"text":"I ordered the meat lovers hot pot and the curry fried rice.    The hot pot wasn't a soup based hot pot to my surprise and was more like a dry stir fry. It was a nice balance of flavours and wasn't overpoweringly spicy or drenched in chili oil, which I've come to expect as the m.o of Sichuan cuisine.   The curry fried rice was also nicely done. The rice wasn't sticky at all and had an aldente texture. There was a subtle curry flavour to the rice that added some intrigue to an otherwise   conventional fried rice dish.  The food also came out lightning quick, in about 5 min or so.   I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Excellent Sichuan food. Tried lobster. It was simply excellent. One order is good for 4 people."}
{"text":"This place opened up about a week or so ago.  Since we like trying new restaurants we decided to walk over there today.  Being a Thursday evening, it wasn't very busy, tables were available.  No greeting at the door or on entering, we chose our seats.  A waitress came by quickly and asked if we wanted anything to drink.  We asked for water and she handed us one menu.  When she came back with the water which was in a bottle, with a plastic cork (kind of different, however the water was luke warm) I had to ask for another menu.  The menu was on a 11 X 17 double sided plastic sheet.   Not really too much of a selection.  We decided to order the rice in soy sauce with peas and slivers of carrots However it also contained corn which was not listed.  (Some people are unable to eat corn for personal reasons).  For the main dish Beef and Ox tripe in chili sauce with peanuts, green onions and other greens.  It certainly was spicy.  These two dishes were plenty for two people.  The food was excellent however the music playing was way too loud!  Once our food was served, the wait staff never returned to ask if everything was fine or if we wanted anything else.  Once we finished, I simply walked over to the cashier, paid the bill, left a tip but she didn't really acknowledge it.  We might go back there again but other establishments on Spring Garden Avenue provide better service, quieter atmosphere, and friendlier service."}

{"text":"I'm a huge fan for Sichuan food. I was eager to try this place as it looked cool af from the outside.   First time here, extremely disappointed. Service was super slow. Rice didn't got served until we almost finish the dish. Servers are not attentive enough.   Pork intestine dish was deep fried with no flavour. No numbing peppers. Spicy bass fish was served with eggplant, which turned out to be pretty good actually, but again not spicy or numbing at all just pure oily.   Not to mention how overpriced it is. A potato dish for 12 dollars. You pay a premium for the nice ambience."}
{"text":"Always a supporter of new restaurant, especially when is down the street from my home and it serves  seafood!  Hotopia specializes in Sichuan cuisine (???). Sichuan is well known for its spicy food and use of peppers due to its humid climate.  The most prominent traits of Sichuanese cuisine are described by four words: spicy, hot, fresh and fragrant.  Remember to grab a few friends before you head over.  Hotopia's portion is XXXXXL and serves food in huge bowl!"}
{"text":"I have been craving for some sichuan boiled fish and decided to try this place. Upon entering I found the restaurant to be clean and spacious. We were greeted right away. The boiled spicy numb basa tasted great - the portion was big, probably would have been enough for four people with two sides. I loved the \"spin\" on the traditional dish by including seared eggplants in the soup. The price was a tad bit more expensive compared to some other sichuan restaurants. We spent around 50 for two people. I however preferred the dining  atmosphere here. We definitely left satisfied. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"So here is the thing, when you fucked up the spicy fish dish so bad that I asked them to take it back to the kitchen and re-cook it, and still taste like fucked up shit. The fish was way too fishy even the god damned chili oils and Szechuan peppercorns can't even cover the fucked up fishy taste (foul taste) from the repugnant ingredient they used. You might wonder \"well it is fish after all buddy, it will taste fishy undoubtedly!\" But not my friend, it was like the taste of dead fish sitting in a bucket for 35 years.   I asked the owner to try the fish, and he admitted it was too fishy. And guess what the pretentious pig charged us full price for the shitballs dish that nobody touched for the entire meal and only gave me 10% discount for the bill.  I came here a lot ever since it was opened, but when you do this kinda shit to tell your regular customer to fuck off, I guess I will."}
{"text":"Dry stir fry in a big bowl suitable for 2-3 people. Got 'the marrying four' (shrimp, pork beef and lamb) and thought it could be a tad more spicy, but I like my spicy food. Bill came to 50 dollars including tax and tip for that dish, one order plain rice and one domestic beer. Enough food for 2 plus food to take home. Will come back to try the other items on menu."}
{"text":"Came here a bunch of times but the food quality was always inconsistent. Sometimes you will order the spicy fish and it will taste amazing, (1/4 times). Other times it will look different.... we have ordered the same fish 4 times and got a different one every time.. even the colour is wrong sometimes (we would specifically point at the yellow/green spicy fish but sometimes would get the red soup base) but the waiters will always insist its the same dish. Once we even pointed that the picture shows a different colour soup than the one we got... but still denial.  Even with that we came back. the last time we came back we got the spicy pot and a spicy fish... each of which are $30+. The spicy pot was good but the fish we got was super sour and fishy. I took a bowl and tried to eat it and had to pour it back cuz it was totally inedible. We complained saying this time it really is terrible and asked them to take a look. At first they took it back to the kitchen and reworked it... but when it was brought back it was slightly better but still inedible. The owner came at that point and tried some and agreed it was not a good fish and apologized profusely and thanked us for bringing it to his attention. He came back a few times to talk to us about how important it was to hear this feedback and he will not order from that fish distributor anymore. We literally did not have any of the fish soup because it tasted awful.   When we got the bill we didn't ask for the fish to be taken off the bill.. but honestly after having the owner come out and agree with our complaint after having tried it and after receiving so many apologies and thanks from him we kind of expected it... I mean we didn't even eat any of it!!!! Instead the guy took off like 10% off the bill and still charged us like $80 plus tax and tip on it. Seriously man. I feel sad they have no idea how to run their business but even when we crave that food we won't be stopping by here anymore.  How can u serve an totally inedible dish (that you yourself agree tastes terrible) and then apologize like a mad man to the customer then take off a random 10% off the bill but still charge $80+ to them when they clearly could not eat it. He even kept apologizing and saying he hopes to see us next time as we're walking out. Yea right so we can pay for another rotten fish. Thanks for the $6 off man. Glad u were able to sell the rotten fish in your kitchen for $30 u are a real pro. (Y)"}
{"text":"Not an authentic Sichuan restaurant. What a pity. We ordered three dishes but none of them were close to real Sichuan dishes. The pictures looked good but I'm quite disappointed. Don't even like the oil they used in bean noodles."}
{"text":"Hotopia is another hot spot that recently got added to the holy grail Yonge and Sheppard area. They serve Sichuan cuisine which will contain a lot of spicy food as well as cold side dishes. For a big mala pot that could be shared between 3-4 people along with some side dishes, i find price point here is decent. Very spacious with great lightings and animated inspo decoration. Between two, we got the \"spicy meat lover\" mala pot and boiled Chinese broccoli. The pot contains beef tendon balls, beef tripes, spam and intestine (u can add extra toppings) with heap of dried chillies. I found it can be oily, but the flavour is very bold and reflects a strong spice element of Sichuan cuisine, which is the numbing affect. However, as a spicy food eater, i find it very bearable. The veggie on the side also reminds me of comfort food with sliced chillies and splash of soy and fish sauce. Overall, great experience, will come back."}
{"text":"Really good Sichuan food. Had boiled fish. The size is too big, the plate (or pot) is almost half size of the table. Will come again."}
{"text":"A pretty decent place. Food are but taste wise and the prices are definitely decent compare to a lot of the places (Chinese or non Chinese restaurants) I have been to in Toronto. A couple of the cold dishes are a little bland, but the entrees are okay. I get the feeling that there is a lot of Japanese influence in this restaurants given  the decoration and how the food and menu is presented. Overall I don't have much complaints, but this is definitely not in the top 3 best Sichuan cuisine I had in North America, but I feel like it deserves for a solid four star given the quality and cost.  Also something interesting I noticed is that the first review on this place is more focused on the service of the waiters rather than on the food itself. I have noticed this to be generally true and is heavily dependent on the reviewers ethnicity. I personally care more about the food rather than the service, and therefore found that a 2 star rating is unfair."}
{"text":"A new restautant thought to try it out.  Food was good I like these type of spicy flavors.  The decor is modern and fast-food like.  The price was way too high for this type of place.  We were around $40 each with one beer."}
