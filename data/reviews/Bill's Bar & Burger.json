{"text":"I stay in the Westin often, so I keep giving this place a try, but this is probably the last time, and here is why:

1) Bar service is terrible 
2) They overcooked my burger twice, and added the wrong toppings when I was 1 of 3 people at the bar
3) Bar service is &!?$ing teterrible!  Man, the bar is where I sit...  Terrible."}
{"text":"over priced. $15 lunch. small portions. $4 for a lemonade?? greasy, over cooked fries that are additional $$. wrong food delivered to wrong tables and wrong customers. just not good. at all. CNN's Top 10 burger?? yea right. such a disappointment."}
{"text":"I came here when they first opened and was disappointed.    I heard they changed the corporate chef so I gave it another try.   I have to say I was throughly impressed.   I also like the biergarten and I think this will be a go to place for after work drinks and burgers.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Super slow service - went there at 10 and there was very few people.  Ordered a wine glass and a salad without meat etc and after 35 min still no sign of salad.  Come on how long does it take to throw some greens from a bag on to a plate.  The staff is good but there seems to be management issues as whole thing is super slow.  Food is ok at best - nothing to rave about but when you are staying at the hotel and it's 0 degrees outside what choice do you have really.  Would avoid this place unless it's a snow storm outside and you don't have any winter clothes and can't leave the Westin hotel"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with a coworker. It was our first time there. I ordered the Bobcat Burger, it was amazing...there's something about the beef, not sure if it was the seasoning it the type, but it just melted in your mouth!!! And the pickles were different, a combo of sweet and dill...yum!! Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I wish this was a half star. Save your money and go somewhere else. For those who are traveling and want something quick do yourself a favor and go across the street, so many other places. This place made my boyfriend and I wait 20 minutes when the restaurant wasn't even filled halfway (due to not enough staff). So being nice we went to the bar in hopes the food and drinks would pay off. WRONG. They didn't notice we were sitting at the bar until 15 mins later. We finally were sat, ordered food. Sliders. You think sliders would be easy, these things were so pink and undercooked it wasn't even funny. So awful like I said, do yourself a favor go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Bills is amazing. The burgers are perfect. I have gone twice and had the Farmhouse Cheddar burger-the pretzel bun makes it. Definitely try the truffle fries; a must. I've also had the sushi which is a great treat; large rolls stuffed to the brim and tasty as ever. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great food and service that welcomes locals and the out of tower alike! Pittsburgh and sushi? Absolutely when you're at Bills! Great selection and expert guidance from Lisa on her favorite rolls which were excellent. Local beers provided an excellent accompaniment to the food and after a few you'll forget you're on the road. Great place and a welcome addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"On a whim we walked into Bills after reading the menu outside. It was definitely a great decision! We had two Bill's burgers and split a side of fries. 

The burger was cooked well and I definitely appreciated the boatload of jalapeños added to my burger. The fries were crispy and a welcome addition! The only complaint we had was the burger size to price ratio. The burger was a little small for the $8 price tag. 

Definitely give this place a try, I will be going back for the sushi!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch during a conference. Waited 15 minutes to get order taken and an hour to get the food. When food came out the order was wrong and the food was just ok.  Don't bother- go somewhere else. The 1 hour wait is not worth a 20% discount off the meal."}
{"text":"Bill's is very convenient to Westin guests as its off the lobby. Their happy hour is VERY good with 1/2 off drafts and wells and their wings are perfect! Warning: sweet and spicy is more hot than their damn hot wings. Their burgers look amazing but we haven't ordered one yet. Their fresh cut fries are wonderful!"}
{"text":"Went to Bill's today since it replaced the Fish Market.  I have traveled a lot for work and have dined at many places. I ordered a Bill's classic burger and a salad.  Was not aware the Burgers are a la cart on the menu and a side salad was $8. Not over impressed with the cost and quality of the food.  The burger was nothing special. The place was nice on the inside and two blocks from the office.  With that said, I have eaten better burgers at my house and other places. I would rather eat at Burgatory than Bill's.
   However,  the service was great, David was a very good waiter and kept my glass filled."}
{"text":"Boyfriend had the Bill's Sushi Roll and he wasn't psyched about it. No flavor, apart from an oddly flavored \"Japanese spice\".

I had a burger which also had no flavor, apart from grease. Cooked as requested, but when it's a pre-made burger, that's really all that's left to mess up. 

When the bill came, I found that we had also been charged for fries, which had presumably been included with the burger. NOPE. If I'm paying $16 for a burger and fries, I'd like to be somewhat impressed. This was just incredibly disappointing. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Extremely pleasant atmosphere, great tasting food, and a staff that actually understands gluten (they even offer gluten free buns).  If you are at the convention center and need a place to grab lunch this is high on the list."}
{"text":"Was not sure what the expect at this new restaurant but was pleasantly surprised! Funky vibe, interesting flow of space, impressive bar and tap selections, and fun foods. Who would have thought about homemade cherry pop tarts for desert w vanilla ice cream? The charred Brocoli was delicious...a smidge salty perhsps. The salmon was beautiful on a side that included edamame. The flank steak had a lovely earthy a jus and tons of fries. The sliders were awesome, tons of excellent flavors mingled w fresh ingredients on a sweet bun.  We are going back!!"}
{"text":"We loved the restaurant and it's location in our hotel. Portions were large. Specific to our order: Reuben could have been less greasy. Fries were on the salty side though the kids liked that.  The chicken tenders were made of up of nicer quality breast meat.   Fish and chips were excellent with the only downside being that the tartar sauce should have been less sweet. The Bill's Burger was fine but not stand out. The restaurant is more for business travelers."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday. But I sure do miss the old fish market! 

This place is a remodel of an old restaurant in a hotel. They did a good job on the remodel. The bar is way nicer and much better layout. I did not like the lighting which was set up on a grid under the drop ceiling and looked like a movie set. Just too much clutter when they could have a nice clean look.

They tables are terrible. They have huge bases and there is no room for your feet under the table. It felt like I had my legs wide open the entire time. Very uncomfortable! 

Service was good but food was not. 

Burgers are 8.00 with no toppings or chips or sides. They claim it was a hand made patty but it was a plain burger that was not hand made. Not to mention I ordered my med rare and it was about a 1/4 inch think and cooked well done. 

And it was served on a plain bun on a old looking diner plate. Come on! At least care about your presentation and throw some chips or slaw on the plate. Charging $1 for a slice of cheese is just stupid. 

Salads are $12 and up and not worth it. 

So this is a burger place! So then why do they have sushi????? I can't figure that one out. 

Won't go back again!"}
{"text":"Incredibly rude staff and awful food. Not much more needs to be said. Don't go here, tell your friends not to go here."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to try one of \"Bill's\" burgers. I only live a half a block away, so today I decided to walk over, place a take out order and try it out. I walked up to the bar, and was greeted with a big smile from Shiah, one of the managers. She was very informative about what kind of burger I might like. I ordered, and the food came out very fast. When I got it home, it was prepared exactly how I wanted it to be and was delicious. I know it sometimes takes time for a new place to \"get it together\" , so the service was not bad for a restaurant that had just opened a few days ago!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Did not receive order that we paid for and nothing was done to help us. Employees were extremely unhelpful. Food we did receive was horrible. Fries over cooked and burnt. Dry. Burgers were tasteless. Would never recommend going and will never go back. Orders that we did receive were all classic burgers."}
{"text":"The burger was frozen. Not much better than a McDonalds $1 burger so I don't think the $10 price tag was justified. Side of broccoli was good but for a burger joint I expected quite a bit more from the namesake entrée."}
{"text":"I can't say that I'm a fan. I expected better food from a hotel restaurant, I suppose, especially after all of the reviews and hype built up around this place.

The hamburger size and quality was comparable to a McDonald's sirloin burger and tasted very gamey. Very overpriced ($9/basic/6-ounce) and underwhelming. Absolutely disappointing considering the quality of other local competition like Tessaro's, Burgatory, etc. Had a milkshake and it was very sweet, average, and also expensive ($6) for the taste and quality.

The location is great and the atmosphere is modern and large, so it would be good for groups. It is interesting that they also sell sushi!"}
{"text":"Myself and 11 others had a great dinner and time on Saturday the 12th. Our server a young man was great. At the end he and the staff gave us all a sample of their peppermint milkshake. Way to go"}
{"text":"Went for a Happy Hour with coworkers from out of town, but even with \"happy hour\" pricing, 4 of us still made out of there with an over $330 bar tab which we feel was not right at all. We had $25 worth of food (which was really really good) but don't see how the bill could possibly be so much and we carefully reviewed each item and still could not see how the tab was that much - especially when we were there for \"happy hour\" prices on several of our drinks. Our waiter though nice and chatty seemed shady as he made seversl \"mistskes\" but allegedly didn't charge us for wrong or incomplete items he brought us, so even with that, there is just no way we could have had such a high bill. The issue was so shady/disputable that the manager even discounted our tab by $40.
We left feeling scammed/targeted for being from out of town. My advice is if you go there, have the wings and pierogis but don't settle in for drinks."}
{"text":"I was hoping for good things from this place but first go round not so good.  Asked for a well done burger not saying it wasn't cooked but it sure did not look like it had been browned at all.  The burger also was tasteless no flavor at all.  Liked the ambiance may try again for happy hour but my go to burger in the burgh is Benjamin's."}
{"text":"Lisa the bartender was great and made traveling easier.  Would definitely go back and recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was a total clown show. Came on a Saturday night and the place was half empty, yet there was still a 30 minute wait for a table for 2. We were told the kitchen can't keep up with the size of the restaurant so they purposely keep it half empty. It makes no sense. We decided to wait at the bar until our table was ready and sat there for 10+ minutes before anyone noticed.

Our food was OK, just a typical chain restaurant burger, certainly not worth of the accolades they claim to have received. Not sure how they do things in NYC but unless they make some changes Bill's won't last long in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I've had better burgers at Alcatraz.  Thin, wispy and underwhelming.  The servers were terrific.  Informed, personable and engaging.  Unfortunately the cuisine {a misnomer if ever there was one} was impersonable, unengaging and overpriced.  I was hungry after the minute amoeba burger passed thru my less than bulky system.

Adios William.  You'll never make in the same town where Tessaro's rules with style, class and um,  a really good burger."}
{"text":"Was a little apprehensive reading some of the previous reviews as to whether we should come here or not, but we really enjoyed ourselves.  We were a party of 9 and there was no problem with the service. Kid friendly.  Hamburgers were very good. Not much of a wine menu though. Our waiter, Jeremiah was exceptional.  We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with this place.  They do  not use fresh ground meat. Ordered with lettus and tomato and recieved lettus and pickle.  Cheese is processed cheese squares.  No salt and pepper on tables.  Menu states bottled Iron City and recieved flat canned beer.  Better burgers from McDonald's.  Atmosphere horrible!  Take your crappy restaurant back to NY & NJ. This site says rate with a star but they do not deserve even a half!!!"}
{"text":"Only thing good was the beer.  Burger was very greasy, chips were over cooked, the seasoning on the wings was burnt, and the chili was too sweet.  Food was terrible and menu selection was very limited."}
{"text":"Great burgers and a huge, well chosen beer list in a cool setting makes Bill's a solid choice for pretty much anyone. The Rock Center location is massive, I prefer the original in Meatpacking with its bar vibe."}
{"text":"I happened to stop by on a recent business trip and was surprised and pleased with how amazing the food was! After a few too many fries, a burger, and a milkshake I was so full I could barley move. Which wasn't bad considering they have a pretty beautiful outside dining section. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I ordered a cheeseburger with a side salad and a cherry pop tart for desert. 

Service was great. Very attentive and friendly. Food came out in a timeline that was expected. Salad was good. Burger was one of the better ones that I had. Food price for these items seemed reasonable to me given their quality. 

However, I was disappointed in the cherry pop tart. It was $9.  Given that price, I would have expected a desert with premium ingredients. Instead, the ice cream that came with it seemed to be of lower grade and I would have expected real cherry filling - not some synthetic goo. 

Overall, it was a good restaurant to go to in a pinch but it cannot compete on the level and experience of Burgatory."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out for work- loved it!

We had the sushi and the cobb salads. They were both very well prepared and the service was WONDERFUL. Elysa took our oder and she was extremely pleasant to work with. 

We will definitely be back-Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this restaurant, and I have been wanting to go here since it opened last year. Last night was the first time I had the chance to go, and I must have had my expectations too high. The house mojito was delicious, but my burger was just OK. I got the bacon and cheddar burger with onion rings on top. It was nothing to write home about. We had a large party too, and they got more than half of the orders wrong. Not sure if that was on the waiter or the kitchen. They apologized profusely for it. There was also no on there on a Saturday night. I expected it to be packed. This will probably be a restaurant I check off my list and don't go back to."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at the restaurant. I asked for the daily special burger to be subbed with the black bean patty and it was delicious. It didn't hold together super well (hard to do with a homemade patty) but it tasted great. Fabulous service from Jeremiah who was friendly and knowledgeable and excited about the new menu. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place as it had been rated as having one of the top burgers in the country. My coworkers and I went for lunch and were seated immediately. The interior is very nice and our server is friendly. I ordered the classic burger, priced at $9. To my surprise, the burger didn't come with any sides and if I wanted fries, it would be $4 extra. I was even more disappointed when the burger that came out was rather small. For $9 I would expect more, but if it tastes good I am willing to splurge. After one bite, I knew I wouldn't be coming back. While the burger was decent, it tasted similar to frozen patties from the store and wasn't worth the price. My coworkers did heap praise on the pretzel bun but felt similarly about the quality of the burger itself. You can get a much better lunch downtown for the price of this place."}
{"text":"Eat here way too often (travel a lot to Pittsburgh). Fat cat burger with egg and meatballs are excellent. Fish sandwich is huge and delicious. Look for Lisa the bartender. She mixes an excellent martini."}
{"text":"I ordered a burger well done.   It came out medium at best! The bartender did not even ask how it was.  I've been here a few times and it is not getting any better!  This place doesn't understand customer service..  Avoid!"}
{"text":"Burgers average tasting...  did not taste like high end beef. French fries barely warm. Service prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Burger place, but the salmon was outstanding, service was great and friendly. Would definitely frequent when in the city."}
{"text":"I had a fairly basic burger, bacon and cheese, nothing fancy.  Except that it was the best burger I have ever eaten! I don't know why, but the burger was just delicious!  Perfectly seasoned and so tasty.  Only reason I didn't give Bills 5 stars is that my fries were cold.  They must have been sitting for a while before I got my plate. Sorry Bill, but cold fries cost you a perfect rating.  I will definitely go back. Next time, I'll send back the fries!"}
{"text":"I honestly had no ideas this place was in the Westin until a fabulous Yelp event held here introduced me.  I couldn't wait to go back and we did a few weeks later for drinks after a wedding held across the street at the Pennsylvania.  This place is spacious and great for large groups.   They have a nice mix of drafts and bottled beer plus cocktails.  We went back last week for dinner and drinks and sat in the bar area (separated from the dining room which I really like) so we could get the happy hour specials. They offer 1/2 drafts and I went with the Fathead's Bumbleberry. My fiancé ordered 2 different Southern Tiers.  The appetizers are also 1/2 off from 4-7 (love the longer happy hour) and we went with the mini hotdogs.  It was basically a gourmet corndog cut into pieces with mustard but the way they presented it made it taste that much better. Delicious and a perfect snack before the main entrée. I went with a side Cesear salad (the portion could have been bigger) with the mini B burgers (comes with 3 sliders with pickles, cheese and onions) for my entree. They were fantastic and it was the perfect amount of food.  The rest of the burgers come on their signature pretzel bun with a side of chips.  You have to save room for dessert as they have amazing milkshakes. Since we were celebrating a birthday we had to order the chocolate bomb or whatever it is called as it is the biggest milkshake you can imagine served with a sparkler.  It has crushed up Butterfingers, peanut butter cups, reeses pieces, peanuts, chocolate icing and whipped cream. It is amazing and enough for two! Our waitress was great and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Bartenders were amazing! Thanks so much to Lisa and Terrance for good old fashioned great service and good food tonight! Will check this place out again!"}
{"text":"Burger was great- moist, melts in your mouth, and bun mashes into burger nicely. 
Hard to believe, but they blew it on the fries, both regular and sweet potato are tasty, but not crisp or hot, soggy,  most likely not cooked long enough! Fries should always be awesome, but a no go here.   Need to up there game.  They should serve them with sauces also and/or in a cone or basket form, where they are hot and salty!"}
{"text":"The only way this place will survive is from hotel and convention center clientele.  I had the Bacon & Farmhouse Cheddar Burger.  A premium burger at Hardee's is better!!!   The $4.00 little basket of fries was cold.  Neither item had any great flavor.  Never again."}
{"text":"I have been here three times so far. The first visit was for lunch. There were three of us and we were sat at a table the size of a manhole cover. I had a sushi roll which was average. 

The second visit was another lunch visit and I had a burger. Nothing to write home about but I cannot say it wasn't good. 

The third visit was for happy hour...overall not the best experience. I was in a group of 15, so I can understand that is never easy for any waiter so I am very forgiving. We had a slight issue with a reservation we had made earlier in the day (they told us we did not have one) however it was corrected promptly. I had another sushi roll which was phenomenal...the truffle roll?

All three visits the service has been average to slightly below. Although somewhat friendly, everyone seems to be nervous or in a hurry. I will try this place again in a few months. I am sure it is just a new restaurant and employees trying to keep up with the new rush"}
{"text":"Food and drinks are excellent, and the happy hour bar menu is an incredible bargain. Staff is very knowledgable and attentive, particularly Lisa, who has become one of favorite bartenders anywhere. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stayed at the westin for a supernatural convention and had dinner our first night at bills and we both had an all-American burger and it was excellent!  We also ordered the not-chos and we were both surprised by how good the bbq chili Watson the chips!  We were both raving how good they were! So since we were surprised we both came back on our second day for lunch and I was blown away by your English muffin burger and of course again your not-chos! My girlfriend got the wedge salad and loved it! We will recommend this to all our friends we will stop back again!  Thanks for saving us from a fast food weekend!"}
{"text":"Great place to have a burger when you're in downtown Pittsburgh. There's a place in Cleveland called Beers to Burger and before going to this place, I'd rate that as my best burger, but having eaten here, it's now my first place burger. Great staff as well, really make you feel welcomed and appreciated and the food again, was fantastic. I'm a fan and will visit here whenever I find myself in Pittsburgh and I suggest you do so as well."}
{"text":"I went here twice because it was in the hotel I was staying in (Westin). I was pretty excited that I had a great bar in the hotel so as to avoid having to drive or walk far. 

It's a nice looking restaurant/bar. I sat at the bar so I don't know what the rest of the place looks like. The service here was really good. I didn't have a single problem. 

First night I ordered the bacon and cheddar burger with a pretzel bun. I was skeptical of the bun thinking it was some sort of gimmick, but it was really good! The burger, I ordered it medium rare, came out rare, but I'd rather go that way than the other. The only big problem with this burger is that the onion rings I ordered to go on top of it were red onions. Red onions are not sweet, they are very bland and in turn really bring the taste of the burger way down. I like the sweetness of white/yellow onions. These were not that. I couldn't even eat them, they were gross. 

The second night I was there I ordered the same thing because it really was a great burger. I asked this time if they could make my burger actually medium rare since it was so rare last time. The bartender recommended I order it medium and then it would come out medium rare (you'd think), but it actually came out medium. Uh. They brought me my new burger out and it was fine, but I was irked by the insistence of the person who brought it to immediately cut into it (which I don't, I eat it as a whole burger) to see if it was okay. That was not okay, the burger was. 

I then ordered a dessert that I waffled on. I really wanted the pop tart but then waiter told me it was really small. I then ordered my other choice, the red velvet birthday cake. They should REALLY have a disclaimer that their cake is NOT made in-house. If I want boxed cake I don't need to pay $6 a slice, I can walk to the grocery store and get a whole cake for that. I don't go to restaurants to have boxed dessert, I just don't. This and the onion rings were why it gets this many stars. 

The service is excellent, the bartender that waited on me both times was very nice and the food could be great with a few modifications. I won't be back, but it was an okay place to have dinner a couple of times."}
{"text":"Great service. Good food. And one of the best beer selections I have ever seen. I ate there every evening during my stay at the Westin because I enjoyed it so much. And everyday the service was exceptional (different server each day)."}
{"text":"While not a place I would have initially picked as a dining spot due to its location, Bill's Bar and Burger has consistently surprised me with its service and the quality of its food. The bar staff create excellent cocktails that will delight you after a long day, and the kitchen also does a great job making orders that will please your taste buds.

During my last visit I was dining with family, so between the group of us we had a chance to test out multiple menu options. For an appetizer we ordered a stuffed pretzel, which was excellent; I'm admittedly sensitive to salt so I thought that particular item didn't need as much as it had, but I suspect a lot of people will be completely fine with that, as pretzels tend to be salty anyway. And the pretzel itself was fresh and warm, so I can't fuss too much!

For our main courses we ordered a veggie burger, sliders, and a pretzel bun burger between the group of us. Nothing disappointed. The meat-based burgers were all mouth-wateringly juicy and perfectly cooked; and my black bean burger set itself apart from being a \"blah\" vegetarian option with its tasty and even spicy toppings.

Unfortunately we failed to save room for dessert this time, which is shame: Bill's is home to some pretty fantastic oversized candy milkshakes. But hey: there are worse things in the world than wanting to come back in the future for dessert, right? I will indeed be back, for dessert and for another meal as well."}
{"text":"Always fantastic service here. Never had an issue. The bartenders are attentive and generous. Food is great and the tap selection is always on point."}
{"text":"Some coworkers and I ate here last week for lunch.  Atmosphere is nice and so is the decor.  Service was attentive.  

Coworkers had real meat burgers and I had the veggie burger since I'm a vegetarian.  They all agreed the meat burgers were okay but not super.  They also started off with Bill's meatballs for an appetizer and they agreed the meatballs were better than Mercato's meatballs down the street.

My veggie burger was okay but it was just a defrosted veggie burger patty which had the potential to be so much more.  I mean really Bill, find a recipe for a good black bean burger and implement it here!  They have jalapenos and guacamole as extras to add, so a black bean burger would really fit in well here.  Also, I cut my burger in half but still had the problem where I bit into it and the entire thing fell apart.  I'm talking everything was pushed out the other side.  I don't know how to make that better.  Toast the buns first maybe?  It was very messy.  One coworker just grabbed his fork and ate his burger and bun off the plate to cut down on the mess.

And the prices?  Yeah, totally unreasonable.  My veggie burger and side of fries came to a total of $12, before tax.  And about those fries - it was a small side order, totally not worth $4.  And they had some sort of seasoning on them that made it feel like I was chewing sand.  It was not a good crunch.  At all.  Bill, you should change that."}
{"text":"If I could give it less than one star, I would. This place is, in a word, awful. The service was non-existent and even the \"manager\" seemed to be less than enthusiastic. I had a burger and, quite frankly, it reminded me of the frozen, pre-cooked burgers that I buy at Costco only less tasty and more expensive. Also got an order of $4 fries which were served cold. Yummy.  I had to ASK for my bill as my \"server\" wasn't bringing it -- I left $0 tip - I think that's the second time in my 48 years on this earth that I've done so. Think I'll be back?"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was HORRIBLE! We just stayed at the Westin this weekend, my wife had a conference at the Omni hotel and we were able to get a great rate for the whole family at the Westin just a few blocks away. The hotel is excellent, so we thought this type of service would be extended to the hotel restaurant. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Our waitress could not have been more dismissive of us. When we initially arrived, she took the drink order for our boys, and when she came back to the take the rest of the order, she didn't ask my wife and I what we wanted to drink, we had to flag her down to get a drink order. I asked for a beer, she didn't then ask if we wanted refills. Never came back to ask us how we were doing, how the food was or if we needed anything else. I ordered my son another hot dog, it took 20 minutes, I couldn't believe she never even came to tell us why it was taking so long. Basically she dropped off our food and never checked in on us again. We had to flag down other waiters to get our check. Probably the worst experience at a restaurant, which is unfortunate b/c we had a great stay at the hotel."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Bill's and in Pittsburgh. The food was delicious. The sweet potato waffle fries are heavenly. Our server, Zach was superb! Great food and outstanding service. Thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times, especially since I work in the same building. Bill's is fine, really. It's not a stand out place for me but it's a good place to go in a pinch when I've forgotten my lunch or we don't want to go outside in the winter or super hot days for work meetings. 

Although, I can only base my opinions on their salads because that's all I've gotten here. Their salads are good. When you dine in, they give you a nice portion. But when you pick up, the portions seem to be a bit small- though this is the case for a lot of places when you pick up, never really knew why. I also order their homemade chips and they are super finicky with it. They don't give you many at all, yet they charge you too much for it. The service is nice, though. Never had a problem!

Again, I only eat here in a pinch and it's okay. Lots of other good options around this area to eat instead."}
{"text":"Dear BR Guest H. of Bill's Bar & Burger.  About the only thing you could do to make me happy is buy me a gift certificate for 5 Guys where I can get some fast service and a great burger and fries."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Asked twice for water refills and never got them.  One of the party guests sent back her burger because it was medium rare not medium well as ordered and they tried charging her for the new burger.  Had to speak to the manager.  Saw my sushi order sitting at the sushi bar for about 15 minutes before the waitress got it.  Also forgot the fries of another member of our party.  Overall a very frustrating experience."}
{"text":"Bill's Bar & Burger is located The Westin Convention Center on Liberty Ave. We went here a couple of times since we were staying at the hotel. Both experiences service was slow, like really slow. The food was good, I enjoyed everything I had an opportunity of trying. However the one time I ordered drinks, I was highly disappointed. It was one of the worst old fashioned I have ever had. I recommend to stick to beer, wine or easy mixed drinks if you decide to drink here."}
{"text":"Just wanting to grab some food while staying at the Westin and didn't want to go far 
The restaraunt is in the hotel making it easy..
The service was impeccable I believe Michael was his name... I had a classic burger and fries...it  was decent and so was the fondue my sister and I shared...
Not bad I would go back ..."}
{"text":"Really awesome burgers and good, local craft beer. My kind of place. I just feel out of place there, it's in the Westin and seems to be a higher class place. I think it was around $6 for a beer and $14 for the burger. The burger was great, so you do get what you pay for. The bartender was nice and accommodating when asked about the different drafts, let me try a sample as well to ensure I liked what I was ordering."}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking:  \"I'm staying at the Westin; it's late, dark, and raining; and, after all, how bad can a hotel restaurant be?\"

Do yourself a favor and take a walk down Penn Avenue, or across the street, or to the closest McDonalds.  Or, just go hungry.

First trip (w a group of 6):  VERY dirty wine glasses, confused orders, out of key ingredients, mediocre food, and extremely slow service.

Second trip (group of 2):  Confused servers, again out of key ingredients (no Greek dressing for Greek salad).  Food arrived fairly quickly, which made it all the more amazing that the burger and fries were lukewarm.  I THINK the toppings on the burger were wrong, but they were not super recognizable.  Not to mention the glass with seriously chipped rim that could have drawn blood.

Why I went back I have no idea, I guess I believe in second chances.  Best to remember wise words from a past President:  \"Fool me once, shame on -- shame on you. Fool me -- you can't get fooled again.\""}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner before a hockey game. My beer was delicious, try the full pint white lightening wit! I got the cowboy burger which was okay but my parmesan truffle fries were amazing. They got better with every bite! The sweet potato fries were great also. Maurice was a good server."}
{"text":"There is a special place in hell for those eateries that disrespect a burger. Bill's Bar & Burger has earned a seat in that place. 

My colleague and I were visiting Pitt on business and staying near the Westin where this establishment is located. We walked in during lunch time and it was nearly empty in the restaurant. They were slow to seat us and even slower to take our order. When a server did come by, he apologized profusely for the delay and proceeded to tell us what was good on the menu. He took off to get our drink orders and the smarmy manager swept in to take our food orders and to drone on about his philosophy on the perfect burger. I was sold on substituting the \"english muffins\" for the standard bun and substituting the fries with the homemade chips. I received his high praise for ordering my burger cooked as rare as possible. \"I wouldn't have any other way, sir\" he muttered.

After more than 45 minutes (and don't forget that this place is empty) we were served our \"food\" along with more profuse apologizing for the delay. 

At first glance, the portion size looked really small. I took my first bite and to my dismay (horror) found The patty char-burned and  the two store-bought english muffins not toasted. Really?! I took another bite hoping for the a different outcome. The second bite was worse. And those homemade potato chips were no better -- I think they may have been guitar pics in a former life.

Naturally, I complained to the server and again received more profuse apologizing. He offered to go to the chef and have what remained of the english muffins toasted. I refused (mainly in fear of what they'd do to what was left of my meal) and I told him that I would just pass on the meal altogether. He apologized again said he'd make the smarmy manager aware of the situation. I expected the manager to come right out to apologize and remove the item from our bill. He didn't. In fact, I didn't see the manager again -- as if he vanished. I envisioned him hiding in the kitchen, behind the friolater until we left.

We received the bill and, yes, I was still being charged for that abomination of a meal. All I could do was laugh and leave the scene of the crime with a bit of grace.

If you find yourself in this neck of the woods, avoid this place. I would suggest you visit two truly exceptional eateries: Meat and Potatoes (http://meatandpotatoespgh.com/) or Proper (http://www.properpittsburgh.com)."}
{"text":"Bill makes bum burgers. Period. If you have ever eaten a burger or chicken sandwich from a Sheetz that is what you will get here, only worse. I got the buffalo chicken burger and parmesan truffle fries. The chicken burger thing was a rubber mess that my dog wouldn't even eat, and that is no joke. I once had to yell at my dog for trying to eat a cat turd and she wouldn't even touch this rubber chicken burger thing. Also, fries were terrible with literally like 10 strands of parmesan. If you ever find yourself in a bind and it's either stop at a fast food place you have been to a million times, remember; Boggs' dog would choose a cat butt nugget over Bill's Bar & Burgers."}
{"text":"Overall menus seem to be quite salty"}
{"text":"We had a late breakfast at Bill's while staying at the Westin for a friends wedding. The American breakfast is delicious - it was $12 for eggs cooked any way you like, 3 slices of thick cut bacon, potatoes and 4 slices of sour dough toast. Not the healthiest breakfast, but it hit the spot after parting all night. Breakfast also included a complimentary mimosa or Bloody Mary. Our server Ashley was very friendly and attentive. We will be back again this afternoon!"}
{"text":"Meh. $24.61 for sushi and a burger. The burger was clearly a frozen patty, and the fries were limp and soggy. I think this place exists as a convenient place for companies to go for a quick lunch, not as a restaurant aimed at impressing anyone."}
{"text":"You might be surprised; this place is definitely not what I expected. I'm not a huge burger fan, but I gave them a whirl after trying some of their samples. 
We ordered a few appetizers to start: Black Truffle Popcorn, Crispy Jalapeno Cheddar Bombs, and Crispy Black Pepper-Crusted Bacon. All were superb, but the table's unanimous favorite was that delicious popcorn.
We then shared the Mini B's. The little patties were unspeakably juicy, and the toppings were simple, but not skimpy.
There seems to be a lot of attention to detail from the chefs. I'll have to come back for a bigger burger sometime!"}
{"text":"Bill's is kind of a divey place in the middle of an upscale hotel, the Westin Convention Center. After walking around the area looking for something that caught my eye, I settled on walking back to my hotel for a burger and a beer.

The reviews were average but it was convenient. The server could not have been more friendly and helpful. I had their basic burger. It's two patties with lettuce, tomato, and onion, on a bun. It comes with their house-made chips or you can \"upgrade\" to fries or a salad at an extra cost.

The burger was a little greasy but not too bad. The meat had a good taste, it was not overcooked (a pet peeve of mine), but the chips were stale. The beer was good. Actually, both of them were good.

Overall, the server made the experience worthwhile - I believe he called himself DJ. Great guy - I ate alone so he came by to talk to me. This alone made it all good."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of Bill's! Located Downtown there are many options in the cultural district, so it took me quite a while to realize Bills was there - however, I'm glad I did. The space is beautiful and very open. The staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming from the moment I walked in the door.

The bar space is certainly big enough for large groups but also seems like if you are there as a solo traveler it would still feel welcoming. I tried several items when I visited and the peanut butter explosion milkshake was amazing!"}
{"text":"The worst experience in a long time.  It took three times to make a simple manhattan.  Then got charged for the mistakes until I brought it to the waiter's attention.  Food was fair at best.  Turkey burger was flat and dry.  Truffle fries had no truffle salt and no one ever cleaned the table after dinner!  Nor were we asked about dessert.  Never again and it will not last at this rate!"}
{"text":"I need to write this review while it is still fresh in my mind, otherwise I am sure I will let something out.

I recently stayed downtown and due to the fact that the hotel I was staying at didn't have a restaurant in it I needed to find food elsewhere.  Yes, I know this is part of a hotel itself, but I did not stay at the Westin.  I was looking for a place that had later hours due to the fact that I was going to have a late dinner.  This place fit that bill on that fact alone, but I probably should have looked elsewhere.  

When I had shown up I had all intentions to sit at the bar to dine, but once I entered I decided differently.  After a rather sad sports day in the city the bar was lined with some long faces and drunken attitudes.  After the host had a lengthy conversation with a coworker I was finally noticed at the host stand.  When I told the host that it was only me and he suggested that I sit at the bar, I deferred that notion and requested a table.  Once seated at the table, it wasn't any better.  Those drunken attitudes seem to have spread out through the restaurant.  To say the noise level was loud is close to an exaggeration.  If I had to hear the drunk lady tell her daughter and son-in-law how much she was ready for a baby any longer I may have offered to help that process along just to get her to shut up.

Once I had a chance to look over the menu I was a little confused.  Everything is priced extra.  That is unless you get the platter deal.  The burger by itself is not on the cheap, ranging from $8-$11.  The sides start at $3 and range up to $6.  So if you were to go on the complete cheap side of things here, your meal before anything else is already at $11.  They do say that you can make your burger a platter, but it is basically the same pricing.  I went with Big Bill's Deluxe Platter.  At $13, it is probably the best value.

The burger patty is bigger, but that didn't make up for the lack of spices.  There was no taste to this thing at all.  And let's touch on the grease issue.  Or should I say let the grease issue touch on you.  There was so much burger grease that the bottom half of the bun was saturated and nearly inedible.  The fries, cold.  However the fries did have a decent seasoning on them.

I really need to touch on the customer service before I end this review.  My server, or maybe I should say order taker because he did not serve a single item to me, was so scarce for me that he might as well had been a ghost.  After my order was taken he only came back to give me my check.  The guy that actually served my food was the most pleasant person I had an interaction with the whole time here.

After finishing my food and drink, I waited for twenty minutes.  In those twenty minutes I watched my \"server\" whiz by multiple times.  I even attempted to wave him down so I could get my check and go.  I'm not sure how he missed me on all those occasions, especially when he stopped at the table next to me to hand them their checks.  People seated after me were already gone and here I still sat.  Finally I received my check and was eager to pay and leave.  I will never stop back here again, this visit has left a less than desired taste in my mouth, figuratively and literally."}
{"text":"Staying at the Westin and didn't want to venture out in the cold. Facility and menu looked enticing enough (burgers, a few other varied options, and a large beer selection - basically your typical hotel sports bar/grill) so I ventured in. Sunday afternoon with Steelers playing at home it was pretty slow at 6 pm, and all TVs seemed to be tuned to the local favorite (which might have been an issue had my Cowboys not disappointed me yet again the night prior). Server was fairly attentive and friendly enough. Ordered the Fat Cat (iirc) burger - this is the \"CNN Top 10 burger\" they tout - I guess I buy that if they ranked only 25 or so. It was a good burger but not extraordinary at all. 6 oz patty (just right) was medium well but pretty moist, somewhat greasy. Sweet potato fries were ok and in a pretty large portion. All in all a decent meal at a fairly reasonable price (burger basket w/ fries $11.50 + 2.75 for iced tea; tax and tip and out the door down about $18)."}
{"text":"Two visits and I'll start with the good.  i found the service very friendly and attentive.  There is good craft beer selection.  The sweet potato fries were perfect.  The chili was not.  Considering they just opened, it looked like the chili had been cooked over and over for days.  The burgers are good but not great.  The portions are very small for a burger specialty restaurant.  Everything on the menu is a-la-carte so a burger and fries is a hefty price for a lunch out. The meat was overcooked.  My friend ordered the cobb salad and said it was very good.  The other was the chicken salad and the meat was dry and the bread burned on the grill.  There is hope I guess, but I don't think this will be at the top of my list for downtown restaurants."}
{"text":"So I want to love this place, but today was tough. The drinks were phenomenal, Bloody Mary and mojito, and the staff is nice, but the burger was very odd. We ordered the turkey burger and it was full of what looked like strings, when we asked what they were I was told it was mushrooms.  I am a foodie so I initially wondered if it was saffron, nope... Looked up all kinds of mushrooms to figure out what this was and I cannot find anything that looks like this. :-( 

The sweet potato fries were great!!

If you come here, please don't get the turkey burger.."}
{"text":"The place is very nice and in a good location. It's a hotel restaurant so expectations were low. However, didn't know the food was going to be so bad. It was completely horrible. If you want a burger to to McDonald's. Cold discustin burger and fries is the worst u ever had. It was wet over salted and cold. Completely horrible food."}
{"text":"Great dinner at bills tonight.  You must start with the not nachos that are made with potato chips instead of tortilla chips.  I had the lobster burger which was tender and cooked just the way I like it.  The salmon entree was cooked to a perfect medium temperature.  The staff was very attentive and well versed with the menu."}
{"text":"I love their mac and cheese but sadly the burgers weren't up to par at all. They use premade patties instead of fresh ground beef. You'd think with the price tag being on level with Burgatory and BRGR they'd be the same quality. But the aforementioned competition is so much better quality.

Slow service as well but likely because I went on like the 2nd day. They're decent but no Burgatory."}
{"text":"This place is great, good was delicious and well valued, my husband had the fat cat burger and talked about it all day! Service was friendly and efficient, very casual and comfortable, what more can you need, we came three times during our visit, as they have a variety of items we wanted to try, and we were never let down. Great atmosphere, happy staff, can't wait to come back on our next trip!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great location, great beer. Random food.... A couple burgers and sushi. Sooo many better places downtown. The food was very mediocre and the service was not good."}
{"text":"We were pretty disappointed with just about everything except the location and decor. It's nicely situated near the Convention Center, inside the  Westin, in downtown Pittsburgh. It's designed as a more upscale \"burger bar\" but the burgers were pretty lackluster. When you're opening up a burger joint in the Burgh, you're competing with places like Burgatory, BRGR, and a lot more trendy spots in our number 1 Zagat rated city. You better bring it.

My burger was super tiny (6 oz, not nearly enough considering I got it with no bun). There was also no option for a double Patty which was sad. It also was nothing spectacular. It was thin and not memorable. My side salad (which cost me 5 bucks) was a handful of lettuce with no toppings.

My husband got the spinach artichoke dip as an app. They gave him a handful of chips and didn't even fill the bowl up with dip. He got the loaded nachos app as an entree and it was loaded... for an infant maybe. Scarce toppings and a small portion for an app that's supposed to be shareable. He said the taste for both was decent but not worth the price or portion.

Overall, we will not be back. Absolutely no point in visiting this spot."}
{"text":"First time and we will be back.  Burgers are great with tons of bun choices.  Our party had the Classic, Patty Melt, Fish Sandwich and the Bacon Burger. My husband proclaimed the Patty Melt as the best ever

We had the Charred Broccoli which was over the top good. Crunchy and seasoned well.  The Hot Mess was fun, fresh cut fries with cheese curds and gravy. 

We saw the Sushi go by and it looked good. The shakes can in so many varieties it was hard to pick from.  

If you find yourself at the convention center, Consol or the Strip District worth the stop"}
{"text":"Omg! This place is ideal for good vibes, excellent service and even better drinks! I've checked out a few places in the neighborhood but Bills Bar & Burger is the only place Ive been to 3 times during my business trip. 

Kelley is amazing. Ask for her! She makes a drink called the Mizz Sinner that will put you in a creative state of mind. I have nothing but positive things to say about this place and the staff!!!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here with a large group of work colleagues. We called ahead to check if they could seat all of us and they said they could. When we arrived about 10 minutes, our table was ready and we were seated promptly. Everything ran pretty smoothy and efficiently. I was just a little disappointed by the size of the burgers. They looked puny. I felt that they wouldn't hold over the average person. My turkey burger was tasty. A few colleagues said that their burgers were a little greasy and more rare than they would've liked. We all agreed that we'd try it again."}
{"text":"Given the limited choices for food within a short walk from Amtrak, this place was okay. Not something I can rave about. Menu selection not bad. Good selection of can/bottle beer but not much on draft. 

Had a cheddar and bacon burger on a pretzel roll. Asked for thousand island on it. Delivery of food was prompt. Burger looked good but the taste was odd. Never tasted thousand island like this. Plus it was very \"wet\". Crap dripping. Everywhere. Too messy to eat normally. Had to to fork and knife it. 

I also thought the beer and wine was over priced. No blush options on wine. $7 for a small bottle of Angry Orchard. 

Will I return? Don't know. Dominos delivered to the station would have been cheaper and just as good."}
{"text":"The food is great and the service was wonderful. My server even suggested making a change to my food order that improved it greatly. We will definitely be back! The milkshakes are AMAZING. I rarely get dessert, but could not pass up the milkshake and I'm glad I didn't. Bryan said the beer flight was good. They definitely have a large  beer selection."}
{"text":"After walking by on our way home from work wondering when it was going to open, on Friday we realized it was kicking, so we knew we would have to go soon.  Saturday night, we decided to meet a friend there for dinner as we were curious. 

I have to say, I am a fan.  We were greeted promptly, our service started and ended great, and the food was pretty good.  I did not expect it to be like some other places that we frequent but when I base this review on other establishments like this, it definitely deserves a 4.  We got the fried pickles and banana peppers with ranch and I think that they were pretty awesome.  We also had Vanilla shakes, a few burgers, regular fries, sweet potato fries and the Steak and Fries (Wagyu steak with a red wine reduction).  The only think I would not get again would be the steak... i will save that for some other places that I go to.  The steak and reduction were good, just not the best that I have ever had and they did several other things better. 

The sushi that I had seen looked good, and since the Original Fish Market was one of my favorite sushis in town, and the staff seems a lot the same, I am confident that when I try it, I will not be disappointed.  I regretted not ordering it when I saw it walk past our table a few times. 

Prices were fair... $5 for a vanilla shake, $8 for a 6oz burger, the steak and fries was $25 I think.  I think they were in line with the market downtown.  

Large beer selection, some good wines to choose from, specialty cocktails... I was pretty impressed.  

I had seen someone mention that they could not tell who was staff and who was not.  The staff (less the managers and the host staff) is wearing denim shirts... easy to spot. 

The place is huge, and it looks like they have a private area too.  I think this a great addition to the dining scene downtown personally."}
{"text":"I have been back here multiple times since my previous review, not by choice.  Each experience has been well below average.  Everything from the service to the food at this place makes me wonder how they are still open at this point. 

My most recent trip was for a lunch.  The place was not crowded.  We asked for a minute to decide on our order.  The server really took this to heart because he did not come back to check on our table for about 15 minutes.  I ordered the fat cat burger and fries.  The burger was overcooked and barely even warm by the time it got to me.  The flavor was below average and you could not taste much other than the special sauce they use.  I have never had a burger here that was juicy or came out anywhere close to hot.  On top of that, the french fries they use are incredibly generic looking.  They are the equivalent of McDonalds fries.

With so many good burger places in the downtown Pittsburgh area, do not waste a meal on this place."}
{"text":"Food was good... the waiter David was not feeling it.. had to pull info about beers and such... like he had better things to do... ooh well."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh over the weekend for a wedding and stayed at the Westin. Bills Bar and Burger is the hotel bar/restaurant. 

Pros - Service was great. Every employee was attentive and easy going. Vincent the bartender, GO TO HIM! There was a female bartender as well. I can't remember her name, but she was fantastic as well. $2 happy hour drink specials. SERIOUSLY AMAZING! They serve food until midnight I believe. I had an order of fries. Fresh and crispy!

Cons - They close too early, but not their choice. After several drinks you can get lost trying to get to the restrooms. That's it. No other complaints from me."}
{"text":"The food here was OK. Not the best burger I've had but some interesting combinations. Definitely overpriced. But we had good service and over all the food was decent"}
{"text":"I liked this place.  The food was good, the service was good, the location was good...but it was deserted the Friday evening my friends and I went.  

I don't know what all those missing people thought they knew, but I suspect they were mistaken."}
{"text":"I was quite disappointed in this place especially since it is in a very nice hotel.  After we ordered, we waited and waited and waited for our food.  Nothing.  The manager did approach our table and did apologized.  He told us about the staff and people know showing up.

The burgers were okay,"}
{"text":"I lived in NYC for a while, and have been to a few of their locations, I wasn't very impressed. They solely rely on tourist foot traffic. Mediocre food, at inflated prices to people who don't know any better. When I heard Pittsburgh was getting a location, I knew that they would need to change up their concept, if they wanted to succeed here... Well they didn't. I'm sure they'll do ok during conventions, but unless they make some major changes, Bill's won't last long in the Burgh."}
{"text":"This review is for the bar only- we didn't have any food.

The bartender seemed like a nice guy, but he was absolutely clueless. The girlfriend ordered one of their cocktails and it took forever. The guy couldn't find the ingredients or tools needed to make the drink. This wasn't a rare obscure drink, it was one of their advertised drinks on the black board above the bar. To top it off, he was coughing the entire time he was making the drinks. Just truly gross. 

As for my drink, I asked what type of beer the Troegs is and he didn't know. He poured way too much beer and it was a mess to even pick up the mug. This experience was so bad we actually had to laugh about it."}
{"text":"After a long flight to Pennsylvania (with a layover of course), we finally arrived in Pittsburgh. We were super tired so we ended up just eating at a restaurant in our hotel, the Westin. The burgers at Triple B were pretty good. I ordered the portabello mushroom burger. The mushroom was cooked tender and the balsamic vinegar was a nice touch, cutting through the rich burger with some acid. It was a yummy first meal in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Food was ok, sushi was better. 

Burger was excellent. 
Chicken and Avacado Club was ok, bread was too hard on the edges to eat so very crunchy...and chicken was a lil over done, but, still ediable. 
Sushi Roll was amazing. 

Great Beer selection, lite wine selection. 

Excellent service and very attentive.  

Will go back for another shot."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers!!!  It's downtown, so it's pricey and busy, but it is a fantastic burger. I have had other entrees that were also good, but I would not sway from the burgers.  It's in a busy hotel across the street from the convention center, so expect longer than usual waits."}
{"text":"oh where do begin??? maybe with lisa? in what i thought was a layover city; and what  thought was a coffee and bagel hotel--- never expecting to spend more than a few hours here ..but then i met bills, lisas. --- sweet; caring; on top of details; schooled me on peychauds bitters and variations of manhattans.  all tasty, but more imp, she opened my eyes and my taste buds.  .i will come back tomorrow nite, after my long, boring business meetings--- and cap off a great visit in a great urban city.  #lisarocks!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever- empty bar had to beg for a drink and got attitude from waitress about wanting another drink, she will get to us when she can. Ok, will never come back ever"}
{"text":"I was on a time crunch and needed to make a quick to-go order. I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and took the bartender up on his recommendation of Sweet potato fries. My order came out within a fair amount of time. The fries were indeed amazing. I was also surprised and excited that the sandwich came double stacked with chicken however, the chicken was a bit more that crispy it was over cooked and a little burnt. That didn't stop me from eating it because I was hungry but it wasn't the most enjoyable meal.
Overall the hostess and bartender offered great service and the restaurant itself was nice with a simple casual vibe. I was just disappointed with my entree."}
{"text":"Bill's is the most convenient restaurant for those who are staying at the Westin because it's right inside the hotel. Usually, I don't go to hotel restaurants because those have a tendency to be overpriced, but it was a rainy July 4th and I didn't want to walk out to the Strip District so what the hey?

The dining area looked very comfortable and spacious, with two large sections. There's a smaller cafe area out back as well. I'm not sure how and when all those areas are used. For this visit, my friends and I sat at the bar. One look at the menu comfirmed what I knew about hotel restaurants. Everything was premium-priced! However, the Pittsburgher I ordered was easily one of the best burgers I've ever had so perhaps it's worth the cost.

There are a host of minor issues with service though. The server probably expects everyone to open a bar tab. I had to tell her 3 times that I was paying in cash before it sank in. Call me old-fashioned but I don't automatically use a credit card for everything. Secondly, she removed the condiment tray before I was done with it.

In summary, if you enjoy the premium burgers or simply don't want to or can't leave the hotel (like Arkady Balagan in Endgame), I'd say go for it. Otherwise, there are much cheaper options elsewhere."}
{"text":"So this is a good hotel bar especially if you are in town for business and staying at the westin. The real plus is Lisa at the bar. She knows the taps, drinks, hockey and makes you feel at home when you are away from home."}
{"text":"I went to this place when it first opened. I work in the Strip District and this was only about a 10 minute walk on my lunch. I thought the food was good and came back one other time before today...It's been several months since I was there and well, I remembered why I was only there that one other time.  The burgers are ok,  they are cooked medium, which I like, but they are on the smaller size, think whopper jr or McDonald's burger size . I ordered the bacon cheddar burger. The lettuce was wilty, bacon was burnt and the cheddar had about melted off so there wasn't hardly any left.when I got back to work to eat it the bun was soggy and I ended up throwing the bun away. For $12 + for a burger I wasn't impressed. You order fries seperately from the burger too and most of them are burnt.  The service is good, but, there are many places downtown where you can get a much better burger for your money."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! My girlfriend and I both got burgers and fries, and both were extremely impressed with the quality and proportions!! I cannot remember the exact burgers we bought, but they were huge, and uniquely delicious! The server made our experience even better. He was amazing kind, and felt like a long time friend that we just met! The atmosphere was great with the comfortable booths and color scheme. I loved everything about this restaurant. We are both underage, so we did not drink any alcoholic beverages, but all of them sounded great! I'm going to be 21 soon, and I will most likely come back around that time to try the drinks! I would highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"In an half-empty restaurant, even though we had reservations, we were seated right by the POS and service station. We ordered beverages and the pour on the scotch was so weak as to be almost non-existent. We ordered salads for our apps and burgers for our entrees. They all arrived at once. We sent back the burgers since we were pretty clear that we wanted them separately. We had the salads, which were ok, not very good but not soul-crushingly terrible. I ordered the patty melt and my husband a double bacon burger. When they came his was a single so he sent it back. When I bit into my sandwich there was no meat. I opened it up and there were just crumbles of burger pressed into the bread, not a whole patty. At that point we just asked for the check and left. We paid for our drinks and salads and the fries, which were ok but again nothing to write home about. The manager comped the burgers we didn't eat - I think she should have done more but whatever, because we will not be back."}
{"text":"Not too bad, not too good...burgers are tastey, but only come ala carte. Frys are good, not great. Beer selection never seems to change,or if so only a select few of them. The appetizers I've had, fondue and Mac and cheese were disappointing. All and all it's just ok"}
{"text":"For a place that has \"burger\" in the title, they sure don't serve a good one. I've had better burgers at McDonald's!"}
{"text":"Food was good. We had Cobb Salad, Mini B's, and American classic breakfast. 

Server seemed a little distracted. Poor time management on when to return to check up on a table. Two side dishes were forgotten. By the Time he returns, we were already done 3/4 way. So just make sure when you do come here, that you have everything you need before they walk away from the table. 

Would return, though make sure we do not have same waiter. Food was good. Just poor service."}
{"text":"The burgers were not worth it my wife got the meatballs and they were the worst she's ever had she didn't eat her meal in my opinion it would not be a place that I would go to again we eat out all the time and this will be a place we never stop at again we had to go out of the hoteldown the street to a place called Sammies for her to get a meal"}
{"text":"Food very average. Burger was just okay, nothing that makes you want to go out of your way to eat again. Service was very poor. Bartener took forever to get our order and then took forever for them to mix the drinks.  Service was so bad we will not come back even though we stay quite often at this Westin.  So sad, the prior restaurant was a favorite spot and now even though the menu is different we had high hopes we could still come down and spend an evening after a long day."}
{"text":"This place was such a disappointment. Drinks were horrible, service was terrible (couldn't even get a refill of water?), and had to send a chicken sandwich back that was SEVERELY undercooked. I suggest going somewhere better down in the heart of the Cultural District."}
{"text":"Great and quick service. Delicious burger and good variety of toppings. Great staff. Late night service. Very friendly. Truffle fries were a little salty. Great price for the value."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. Great menu. Great sports watching events after a day a work. Would recommend that you eat at the bar -Lisa is the best, she's knows the menu and knows her hockey! 

If you like beer, burgers, sushi and a good atmosphere while on the road, you can't beat Bill's."}
{"text":"No one really in the restaurant but took food way too long to come. The food was below average. I ordered a crab stuffed flounder special..but it really was a plate of vegtables and potatoes with half size piece of fish. Truely disappointing.  The burgers ordered by my party were not even warm and were not any good. The chicken and waffles was burnt, dry and salty. Our waitress was very good or i would have given a 1 star."}
{"text":"Was in town from Philly and stopped by for my last meal before I got on the greyhound. Food was great! Dave was very attentive and helpful. Will definitely come back when I come back into town."}
{"text":"Considering this place just opened, our experience was excellent. It's certainly a more accessible atmosphere and menu than its predecessor, The Original Fish Market, and definitely much more affordable. While I'll miss a handful of the menu items from the OFM, as well as the larger array of sushi offerings, Bill's is much more suited for economically-conscious visitors, convention goers, and really anyone unwilling to wait at some of the other, more established places downtown. There was plenty of staff on-hand and service was excellent. We were greeted by a nice hostess staff and manager, and once seated, had a wonderful experience with our waitress and the other staff that we interacted with. It certainly was a nice surprise based on some of the other reviews we had read. Perhaps we got lucky...perhaps others on here were unlucky. Either way, I have very little to complain about.

With many on here complaining about the high cost of a meal, I tend to disagree. I guess I'm just used to dropping $12+ on a burger, a la carte (a trend that's growing in the area as places like Burgatory continue to raise the bar on both flavor and cost expectation), but their price points fall below other popular places in the Pittsburgh area, albeit for a slightly smaller patty (6oz, when most promote 8oz). I got the Fat Cat burger, and it was delicious. It was a basic, greasy burger with American cheese and caramelized onion on an English muffin. Simple, and well-prepared (medium is their go-to temp, but they'll do whatever you prefer). The muffin was actually ideal for a greasy, medium burger. It didn't get soggy at all (although, to be fair, I housed that thing in about 2 minutes, so I never gave it a chance). 

Our group ordered quite a bit from the menu. Aside from my Fat Cat, my wife got the steak & fries. The fries were, by far, the down side of the meal. A bit too soggy and undercooked. Her steak was delicious, but she orders similar meals at some other outstanding restaurants (Brewer's Art in Baltimore or Eleven in PGH), and it wasn't even close to on par with those places...especially not for the $25. The steak was really good, though. Her fries were honestly the only issue we had, though. The \"Frickles & Peppers\" were perfect and crunchy, with a hint of Old Bay to the batter. The vanilla shake was basic, but very good...so yummy, in fact, that I ended up starting AND ending my meal with one. For $5, it's a heck of a shake. Their side of charred broccoli was tasty, and the sweet potato fries were absolutely PERFECT. I can usually limit my fry intake, but not this time. Perfect level of crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. If my wife's fries were as perfect as the sweet potato fries, I'd have likely given Bill's five stars.

Overall, it's hard for me to be too critical, and I'm rating Bill's on a curve. It's not pretending to be fancy and I think the expectations set by the menu offerings and atmosphere place it in that TGI Friday's-level of expectations, only much better. We've been to so many places that delivered way worse experiences days after opening that I'm confident Bill's can succeed and only get better. With a pleasant and attentive staff, simple, well-executed menu, and - in my opinion - fair prices in a downtown restaurant scene that's continually getting more expensive, I'm oddly excited to return. Walking by this place every day means we'll either get to see it improve or worsen, but regardless, they've proven it's worth revisiting very soon! Check it out!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Jay and Kelly were not only attentive, but also very informative on what's the best and not so good places to visit in Pittsburgh... The food was great, and the service was exceptional... I will definitely eat and drink here again... Great place!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered burgers and some snacks and I have to say the Pittsburgh Burger is sooooooo great! It contains many materials and I felt so happy with those things all in my mouth.  I'll be there again!"}
{"text":"On the food alone, I give this place a zero. You have burger in the name of your business and cant even cook one right. I got a bacon cheese burger that was all bread and no burger. You're serving me a thin patty that's undercooked with a pretzel bun that tasted like I was eating a loaf a bread. All this for 14 bucks? Embarrassing! ... The service was good."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening for dinner. There was no wait, which was nice, but a party of children which were running all over the place. This was going on the entire dinner. 

Aside from that, the food was not worth the price. I wouldn't believe how expensive it was. The sides of fries the waiter just asked what our choice was, she did not say for extra cost ($2.50) would you like fries. I got onion rings for 2.50 and there were FIVE small onion rings on my plate. 

I don't mind paying for sides but at least give me enough to be full. 

I won't be returning and hope that they change the cost for added sides because it is really a shame. 

Beers are expensive as well and the meat for burgers does not seem to be fresh."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this restaurant I'm disappointed. I think I am fooled by the allure of a nice bar and atmosphere. Will occasionally go here for a beer and service is always a crap shoot. Employees always either seem to be in a bad mood or have an attitude."}
{"text":"Wow all of our food was great - the Peanut Butter Bomb Shake was especially over the top amazing! Plus, they have a new outdoor beer garden which means I know where I will be spending my summer afternoons."}
{"text":"The service was great, they were fast, kept the drinks full and checked on us the right amount of times.  Unfortunately was not happy with the food.  I ordered the chicken sandwich and it was terrible.  extremely dry, over cooked and you could tell chicken was a store bought frozen patty.  I had very high hopes for this restaurant but I doubt I would return.  My suggestion would be to remove that sandwich form the menu or make it with real chicken."}
{"text":"I'm basing this only only one visit, so I'm aware my opinion could change...but isn't that true anywhere? First impressions: the hostess stand staff needs some training on making guests feel welcome! The couple of chicks just standing there were more interested in complaining to one another than in giving a smile. Not good. 

Upon getting to our table, there seemed to be confusion over who our waiter was, but was soon straightened out. At least he was friendly and helpful and knew the menu...including what is and isn't gluten free.

The food? A top notch, well cooked burger for me! The Onion Soup Burger was go good, I fact, I've been craving another ever since. 3 in our party really enjoyed the same selection. Others ordered the chili cheese fries, and several other burgers. Every single one of us are looking forward to a return trip.

Next time I'm opting for one of the boozy shakes! And the onion soup burger...soon!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Servers are slow and food is over cooked at times. I had maybe one or two good times here but more bad times.  Today, was the worst experience ever.  One of the workers, who looked to be a manager, an older guy, was sick.  He was Hacking all over the place.  So I am sure he was hacking all over the kitchen and everyone's food!  If he is working and sick, I am sure they let their servers and cooks work sick. Very considerate of this person to spread your sickness.  We will never eat here again and my work frequently comes here.  We will go someplace else."}
{"text":"Arrived from a Steeler game Christmas Eve at 9 pm with our two kids. When our meals finally arrived  at (2 hours later) 11pm, totally wrong, We first and finally complained. When the manager, Marcus, arrived we expected him to apologize and correct the order. But instead, Marcus turned the tables and took out meals  away stating it was Christmas and because we complained we should get nothing for complaining. Thankfully, he left our children with their meals. My husband and I sat at the table while our kids ate. The incident was totally bizarre. Marcus should NOT have a job in service management. He was an angry, arrogant, somewhat unstable person. THIS WAS RECOGNIZED BY SEVERAL TABLES DINING NEAR US. Because of this, I will never eat here again. Total shame as we live in NYC and there are three restaurants. As a big traveler and total foodie this was the most bizarre experience ever."}
{"text":"It was just ok. Nothing special as far as the quality of my burger.  The burger was cooked at a low temperature and it resembled more like being boiled than char grilled.  I wouldn't order a burger there again."}
{"text":"Highly suggest the fat cat burger. Bills is a wonderful spot for great milkshakes and awesome burgers."}
{"text":"We ate here for a late dinner.  You never know about hotel restaurants (it's in the Westin) but this place has some super tasty food!   We shared a Caesar salad, which was excellent. The portion was a good size, the croutons seemed house made, and the dressing was quite good.  A very satisfying Caesar salad!  I ordered a fish sandwich with no tartar sauce.   They accidentally put tartar sauce on it but the customer service response was excellent - the server apologized and left quickly to get me a fresh sandwich. Then the manager came over and apologized. They were so nice about it and pretty quickly I had a new sandwich with no tartar sauce. So kudos to them for the way that was handled!  And happily, the sandwich was delicious - tender, flaky fish in a crunchy Panko outside on a buttery brioche roll. My husband got the Bill's Burger.  Again it was delicious - juicy and flavorful on a brioche bun.  A special shoutout to their awesome crunchy house made potato chips!   Our server Jessica was fantastic - efficient, professional and friendly.  The only element that needs some tweaking is that the decaf coffee was very weak.  But overall, very good food, awesome customer service and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to Bill's on a Saturday afternoon for drinks because we had some friends staying at the Westin. I would of never came here if it wasn't for that. I was pleasantly surprised! As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a smile. There weren't enough seats at the bar for all of us so the host told us to sit in the couch/lounge area and he'd send a server over. The lounge area was cute and casual. The service was fantastic! I wish I could remember our servers name. He kept coming over and checking on us and getting us drinks even after a wedding party came in and it started to get busy. The service alone makes me want to go back and try the food! However, it's located in the Westin and the drinks are rather expensive."}
{"text":"Tried this place out as my wife and I were staying at the Westin Convention Center. It's not bad, but it was pretty average. Got their 2013 burger that won an award - pretty tiny, but was definitely savory enough.

Would not recommend the cornbread."}
{"text":"The restaurant is attractive and comfortable.  Server Jordan provided pleasant, competent service.  The burgers are a bit pricey, $13 for a half pound with house-made chips, $1 more to substitute fries.  They are attractively presented and delicious: made from fine cuts of meat.  My cheddar baconburger was served on a pretzel bun, making it more enjoyable for me.  This is a fine choice for an excellent burger meal in Downtown Pittsburgh.  A side note: my companion and I dined here during Piratesfest, the annual off-season gathering of Pittsburgh Pirates fans, which was taking place at the adjacent Convention Center.  The only other party in the restaurant at the time was that of Pirates Manager Clint Hurdle and his family.  It was our good fortune to have had the opportunity to go over and chat with them.  Clint could not have been more gracious and kind: a lasting and special memory to accompany the good food we enjoyed at Bill's!  Clint told us how he enjoyed the restaurant as we did."}
{"text":"Although I usually look for locally owned, mom and pop kind of establishments when I choose a place for dinning, I was very intrigued to try Bill's Bar & Burger that is on CNN's list of the top 10 best burgers in America.  The place just recently opened in the Westin Convention Center replacing the Original Fish Market, which closed last November.
 
First off, the place is huge!  I made the mistake of thinking that I could enter it from the outside. I ended up walking the length of the Westin entering the hotel on the east side only to have to walk the entire length of the hotel again to find the entrance. Do yourself a favor if you come here and simply enter the hotel off of the main entrance on Tenth Street. The entrance to the restaurant is right there on your right. Inside you get the feeling of spaciousness. I was left to wonder if they will ever fill all of these seats.  In addition to traditional seated dining, there is a full bar with an impressive beer list and, I suppose as a reminiscence to its predecessor, an eight seat sushi bar.
 
I passed on the sushi in favor of its namesake; a burger and took a seat at the bar. The bartender, Becky, pleasantly greeted me, offered me a menu and gave me a moment to look it over. Wanting to try something unique I went with the Fat Cat Burger and included fries and an ice tea with it. It took only 10 minutes for my burger to arrive. It was two greasy patties with melted American cheese topped with a mound of caramelized onions and butter served on a toasted English muffin. The fries came in a wire basket. Wake up arteries!!! 

No doubt the burger was yummy. Greasy as all getup but what would you expect? The fries were average at best with most of them being \"fry fragments\" (if you know what I mean), hardly worth $4.00. The entire bill for a burger, fries and ice tea before tip came to $18.14. 

The service was exceptional, the atmosphere was pleasant and clean but in agreement with Maurice W. and Dave M. who provided previous reviews here, $18.00 for a greasy burger, fries and a drink is way overpriced for the Pittsburgh market. Especially when you consider all of the options in the Cultural District which offer quality meals for less. I say, bring back the Original Fish Market."}
{"text":"I went to Bill's twice recently and must say my overall experience was a NO GO. As in, DO NOT GO HERE. Before you think I am overreacting, read on...

I went to Bill's for the first time for lunch. I was with a group of coworkers. Our group of six or so was seated quickly, which was a plus, but seeing as the place was half-full at most, that didn't require much effort. Our service at lunch was okay; I will say the server was friendly enough and knowledgeable about the menu. But here is where it gets hairy: the food is OVERPRICED AND A LA CARTE. You order your standard burger for $9 or so (they have variations on the base burger for up to $13), but then as you add on extras, you're paying for each topping. Now, this isn't a groundbreaking concept. Burgatory does this, but I have no problem paying $15 for a giant gourmet burger. Bill's burgers are comparatively standard in flavor and are about the size of a fast food burger. I'm talking small. Which is fine for lunch, but charge me $5, you know?! We were in and outta there in about an hour, which meant we were late getting back to work from our lunch hours.

But the real kicker here is when we decided to give this place another chance and go back for a birthday happy hour. We were greeted rudely... WELL, we technically were not greeted at all, as there was no one at the front desk when we walked in. So, as we scoped-out whether we wanted to sit in the bar or dining room, we were quite literally intercepted by one of the servers who said, \"UM [SIGH], DO YOU WANT A TABLE??\" To which we replied, \"Um, yes, please,\" and she then stated, \"Well, let me go back and check with, YOU KNOW, the GREETER.\" Read this in a rude, pretentious tone (THIS IS A BURGER JOINT!), and you get the idea. Keep in mind there was no one there when we walked in, no noticeable sign saying stay put and we'll seat you, and there is a GIANT BAR when you walk in that gives the SEAT YOURSELF impression. (This was this past Tuesday night, November 10, 2015, by the way, in case management gives a crap and wants to train their staff further...) This server (female) then grabbed a young woman walking by who we assumed was our server, because we weren't actually introduced, and hollered the word \"COMMUNAL!\" at her before scurrying away to ruin someone else's night... Okay, so we are seated at this large table in the dining room without actually being asked if we'd prefer the bar (there were only six of us - we're not talking giant party here), and told after we'd been sitting there for several minutes that this \"communal\" table meant that they MAY be seating another large party with us at any point, and therefore, we might have to move our stuff off the seats beside us to make room... ... ... OKAY. I won't even get into the inexperienced server, because everyone's been a new person at a job and waitressing is not easy, I get it, but this girl had NO guidance and seemingly very little training. When we asked for a manager after things were going downhill, THREE TIMES we asked, mind you, a manager never made an appearance and simply whispered things in our server's ear awkwardly behind our table. This happened. We were not rude, we just wanted someone to explain what the heck was going on with happy hour, because our server DID NOT KNOW, literally could not tell us what was on special, and she repeated twice that they were doing us a favor by extending the happy hour deals into the dining room, because they don't do that. THEN LET US SIT IN THE BAR! We were a party of six ready to spend money, and there were very few other customers in the restaurant, so we thought we'd be taken care of... Even just a piece of cake and candle, for god's sake: if you can't even do what T.G.I. Friday's can do, YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

Oh, and their happy hour beer special was $5 DUQUESNE AND ROLLING ROCK BOTTLES. $5. You read that correctly. And $5 appetizers that were the size of my pinky finger. (I'm short.)

Awful, just... Bill's Bar & Burger & Disappointment."}
{"text":"Fresh ground beef!

Was very pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food here! Came in on a rainy day when I was in the area for something else. 

Started with the jalapeño cheddar bombs. A little on the dry side but were tasty and spicy. Tried the bills burger and the fat cat (sub a regular bun). Both meats were fresh ground, well seasoned, well cooked. Fresh toppings! French fries were good but onion rings better!

Will definitely be back and it's a Landry's restaurant to boot. They have one of the best rewards programs in the restaurant industry."}
{"text":"I think that I and two of my co-workers have visited every Burger restaurant, joint, bar in the Downtown Pittsburgh area.  So, I made reservations for our pilgrimage to Bill's Bar & Burger expecting a blow your socks off burger experience.  Let me first say that the restaurant décor is inviting.  White tiled walls, red accents and dark wood accents, I was pleased with ambiance as well as the wait staff.  Friendly, without hovering, glasses refilled and plates cleared without asking.  Can't ask for much more than that.

Now on to the food.   Bill's Bar & Burger is supposed to be known for their amazing burgers and their use of a custom beef blend made especially for their restaurants.  I've heard people rhapsodize about their burgers and all three of us ordered the \"Bacon & Farmhouse Cheddar Burger\" with thick hickory bacon (nitrate-free), aged cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes and pickles served on a pretzel bun.    The burgers are supposed to be a Pat LaFrieda custom blend, fresh ground daily and hand-pressed into 6oz patties. (We'll talk about this later.)

We also ordered their regular fresh-cut fries and \"Iron City Fondue\" which included an Iron City beer reduction, local cheddar, whole grain mustard, soft pretzels and kielbasa.  
 
So, let me just say that I was disappointed and underwhelmed by the food.  The famous Pat LaFrieda blend didn't seem to be hand-pressed at all and the burger wasn't well seasoned.  I've had Pat LaFrieda meat before and the burger that I had at Bill's Bar & Burger just didn't taste like their meat.  The burger was just okay; Not bad, just not spectacular.  I don't know what to say...  Additionally, the fries were tasty, but the order that I received had bits and pieces of fries. (Like they were the tail-end of the fry basket.)  With regards to the \"Iron City Fondue\", the beer reduction was a nice touch, but the whole grain mustard was overwhelming and the kielbasa had a strange aftertaste. (I think that it tasted a little like the fluid used to keep the fondue warm.)  There was also NOTHING distinctive about the pretzel bites. (They tasted like the frozen pretzel bites that you get at the grocery store.)

Overall, the restaurant is attractive and the service was great.  The food was just okay, which is really the main attraction.  The carpet doesn't match the drapes in my opinion.  I would go back again, but my expectation level has been readjusted."}
{"text":"They have great food and their milkshakes are monster shakes. I was here for a Yelp event once and I loved that atmosphere with the bustle of crowds and things to do. When there's not an event you'll still get a good meal and some background music but depending on if there's a convention or not determines if they're busy. I don't eat red meat and still had plenty of options. These guys are more than burgers. Also do yourself a favor and try their queso. The milkshakes are also cheating yourself if you leave without one. Their happy hour menu is also affordable and I would recommend. The only hassle is finding parking. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This rating is strictly for their happy hour, which I've been to a couple times. Runs to the respectable time of 7pm, for one. Includes all beers, house wines and some great food selections."}
{"text":"We figured that since this restaurant is in the Westin lobby, it would be good. Sports bar feel, but the food is bad and service is worse. 
We were quickly seated at a dirty table and were given dirty, sticky menus. Water was served and then no one came to take our order for at least 10 minutes. Ordered an appetizer which took 30 minutes to get. Same problem with the entree.  Our waitress took our order and brought our check which was awkward as she never really waited on us. We flagged down other waiters for water and everything else we needed (napkins, silverware and missing items we ordered). No one ever cleared empty plates and glasses during our entire stay. Food quality was at the lower end of the sports bar spectrum. Very salty overall and soggy from sauces and grease. It was a two hour misadventure for our table for two."}
{"text":"Many thanks to the staff of Bill's Bar & Burger in downtown Pittsburgh for a DELICIOUS & FANTASTIC THANKSGIVING DINNER! I am the main organizer of two Meetup groups, Pittsburgh Dining N' At & Burgh Adults. Every year I host a Meetup Friends Thanksgiving dinner for my two groups, and I often cross-post the event to a few other groups where I'm an assistant organizer. 

This year I chose Bill's Bar & Burger because the price was affordable for the most people (Only $25.40 for a full Thanksgiving dinner with side dishes, dessert, soft drinks, tea, coffee, and tax and gratuity included!), the food was all home-made in house, and the restaurant is centrally located. Tiffany Welsh, the Special Events Manager, was a joy to work with and answered all of my questions in a timely manner. The day of the event, the staff provided my group with excellent service, and the turkey dinner, side dishes, and pumpkin pie were the best I've had in any restaurant on Thanksgiving day! 

It's a lot of extra work to write separate checks for such a large group, but Bill's Bar & Burger went above and beyond the call of duty to accommodate my people. We all got our food and drinks really quickly, and the food was delicious. And you could tell everything was home made with quality ingredients.

After dinner, we enjoyed spending time in the lounge area near the bar where there is a sofa and comfy chairs for customers to relax and hang out while enjoying after-dinner drinks and conversation. It was a really fun event, and Bill's Bar & Burger really hit it out of the park! They took care of my group with top notch customer service AND really delicious food! THANK YOU FOR A GREAT TIME! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I went there with my family and we had an awful experience.
We were seated by the host, and no kidding, it took over 15 minutes to get service on out table. When the waitress came to take our order we were thirsty, hungry and already tired to be there waiting. Once the waitress took out order I asked for a glass of water and that took a lot longer that I would have expected. I had to ask water three times for three different people until we finally got a glass of water.

Our food came out quite fast which was great, but service was somewhat bad."}
{"text":"My kids took my wife and me to Bill's for Fathers' Day. I ordered the Bill's burger. When it was delivered, I thought they forgot the meat. Then I found it; it was the size of a slider! The $5 fries were very ordinary and a small portion. The appetizers were cold when served to our table. All in all, VERY expensive for poor quality food. Stay away..."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of tasty food and great service and this location seems to cover both very well. I ordered the Bill's burger with the special sauce and some sweet potato fries. When it came the bartender asked if I had ever tried sweet potato fries with syrup as oppose to ketchup. I was a bit hesitant at first but to my surprise it tasted really good. Then after telling her I had a sore throat  she made me a special ginger ale with mint leaves that not only soothed my throat but quenched my thirst as well. I'd recommend anybody to come back and see Kelly and ask for her signature \"twisted ale.\""}
{"text":"Being new to this place it was confusing to know where to enter to get to this place because it has a sign on one end of the building with doors but when you entered it seemed like they have multiple entrances with no clear way where to start.  So you would want to make sure to enter near the hotel side of the entrance.  But I really enjoyed the Pasaneo's burger and the best part they have Gluten free buns as well as pretzel buns.  I would give it more stars but the entrance to the place really bothering because I ended up walking through the entire restaurant just to get to the hostess"}
{"text":"I never Yelp... But Bill's Burger Bar made me Yelp, congratulations! Despite my girlfriend reading mostly bad reviews (and not telling me) she chose this place because it was located inside the hotel, which is the only good thing about this place, the waitress we had \"Shay\" was also very nice. The food is mediocre at best... Just horribly average to poor... The drinks are very pricey ($10-$15) and they take it upon themselves to supply you with Top Shelf liquor (how convenient... They're not paying for it). My best advice would be to go anywhere but here for food, you will only leave disappointed and a lot lighter in the wallet for very subpar food."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurants venue! The bar is very nice, it's very very clean, well arranged and huge! I walked in an exit by accident and saw the whole place and there is nifty art on the walls and you can tell there's a lot of money wrapped up in it. Nice views of downtown and such. It's sorta easy to cruise down Liberty and miss it though. Only way in really is by Uber or parking in the Greyhound Station. They have an outdoor eating area that should open up soon id think when it's not cold out. I had this awesome blue Hawaiian alcoholic drink that was a 10/10. They didn't skimp on alcohol! And my burger was the Konnichiwah Burger and the Chili and let me tell you it was pretty good. The chili was well done and flavorful run of the mill countryfied meat/bean chili and the burger was so good. It may sound silly but they don't use a bun that fills you up. You get full on the meat and fixins. The bun is simply there and small which is how it should be. It's attached to the Westin, so if you're staying there and need some food this is one of a million places you can go. :)"}
{"text":"This place is a must try! Food is out of this world good & the service is top notch. The bartender (I think his name was Theo?) was super funny, friendly, and really knew his stuff on their impressive beer selection. Got to meet the manager (her name was August, i believe?) and she, too, was great; not only with me but many of the other patrons in the restaurant. I'm in Pittsburgh 3 or 4 times a month for business & this is now my go to place!!!  #BillsRocks"}
{"text":"I should've ordered the happy hour wings.  My bad.  

Firstly, three bar tenders on shift and all looked my way when I sat at the bar and all ignored me for a good bit.

I ordered the \"whitefish\" sandwich and a draft beer. 

What I got was some sort of shriveled, dried up, thin, farmed, brownish fish.  Probably tilapia.  

What I can't stand is misleading menu writing.  It's like lying to my face.  

Simply put, you can't trust Bill.

Never again at this place."}
{"text":"Wah!

This is my second time visiting. The first time I arrived for happy hour the week prior. The bar service was so slow. I had to give the bartender the evil eye before I could get a drink after staring at the two bartenders for 15 minutes. I had a mojito since it was a happy hour special (still $8), but it was good. A little more lime-juicy than a normal mojito, but I liked it. 

The next time- I came for lunch with co-workers on a Wednesday (I figured I would give it another shot). My one co worker made a reservation for us at 12pm. I was impressed that we were seated right away considering the crowd, and that we were a few minutes late. 

The interior of the restaurant is nice- It's also a lot bigger than it looks from the outside.

We were seated, and our drink orders were taken quickly. Our water arrived after 15 minutes, and my mojito arrived after 25 minutes. The manager brought my mojito to me, and advised it was on her for the delay. I thought it was a nice gesture- until I tasted the mojito. Too much simple syrup was added, it was horrible and very hard to drink. Not at all like the one I had last time. Couldn't taste any lime at all. I didn't complain any further as it was free. I opted to try their sushi for lunch. The California roll was decent, and made with real crab. The spicy tuna roll had too much sauce and not enough tuna for my taste. My friend tried one of the tuna rolls, and liked it. 

My co workers each had burgers and fries. First off, one of the burgers never showed. The one co worker was so hungry after waiting 40 minutes for the food, she started eating hers. She said the burger just tasted like patties from a box (they also looked liked patties from a box). After the second burger arrived, the same manager gave it to the other co worker for free. 

To top it all off, my receipt should have showed the sushi since my mojito was free. There was an additional charge of $1.00 for pepper jack cheese that one of my co workers actually got on their burger. At this point, I'm so annoyed I deducted the $1 from the tip. 

The waitstaff was very friendly- I feel bad only giving two stars. I'm so disappointed since the restaurant is located in the building I work in downtown. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I came here with a few of my friends, and it was definitely good. I had the turkey burger, which was cooked very well and sweet potato fries, which were very good. However, the portions for the price aren't very reasonable compared to other burger joints in the burgh. They have great deals during happy hour, so I will definitely be back for that."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, will not come back if they get rid of it. Keep the sushi!!! Everyone I talked to said they only come here for the sushi. Pittsburgh lacks a good sushi reasturant and the original was it. Corporate doesn't know what pittsburghers like but we love the sushi"}
{"text":"Their food is decent, but the wait time to get a cobb salad was 50 minutes. Wait staff are nice."}
{"text":"Found a bug in my drink, they remade it but did not comp anything.  Then when our food came out they said my sons burger was made wrong and they had to remake it.  But there we sat with food in front of us while my son had nothing for well over 10 mins.  Awful service.  Decent food."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I was this thoroughly disappointed in a burger. First off, it should be a sin to not offer a free side with a burger order. Their veggie burger has to be the worst I've had in a while. Apart from being mushy and barely staying together in a patty form, they couldn't even find a bun that could fit the patty properly, forcing me to eat it by scooping up the broken patty pieces with a fork. Come on Bill, get it together."}
{"text":"We all know Pittsburgh has become Foodie City and having Bill's Burgers here only adds to it. I went into Bill's with low expectations because of its hotel location. What a ridiculous preconception; they proved me wrong. The layout is spacious with great ambience as well as a small courtyard style patio.
I can't imagine how difficult it is to work in the service industry but you'd never know it with employees here. Customer service levels exceeded my expectations for sure. I like being able to post positive reviews when a team of people work so hard at what they do and genuinely seem to be enjoying themselves. The bar has a great selection of beers and spirits and the food is impeccable.
Chef Michael (Chopped winner) rocks! The sliders and breaded jalapeño cheese balls are super yummy. The food was beyond delicious! Simply put, the food, drinks staff and service at Bill's=perfection!
I can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"We decided to go to Bill's Bar and Burger after walking around the RV show at the convention center because it was in a convenient location. I made a reservation via OpenTable and we were seated right away. That was the only positive experience the entire evening. Our server did not come to our table for about 20 minutes to take our drink order and then it took another 20 minutes for him to bring our drinks. The wait for our meals wasn't any better as we waited at least 40 minutes. The server did not come to check on us the entire time we waited. The food was mediocre at best, especially for the price. Again, our server never came to check on us after we were served our meals. It wasn't until everyone was done eating that he came back and we asked for the check immediately. I would definitely not recommend this place."}
{"text":"There are 40 servers and one bartender. And everyone is in a panic. Twice we were asked for our order and twice we didn't get it. Didn't ask how we wanted our burgers cooked. Burgers were tiny. So awful.

And who serves sushi and burgers? The sushi is about on par with Giant Eagle..."}
{"text":"I did the takeout, not the dining room. The food was okay but the staff could not have cared less. Super rude and unhelpful. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Not good at all!!!! With all the competition around you would think they would know the market... Almost 20 for hamburger & fries... Child please!!!!"}
{"text":"Food: 4 stars
Service: 2.5 stars

Let me start off by saying the burgers my friend and I ordered were very tasty. Would recommend the food. Service however mostly sucked.

My friend and I came down here from our room at The Westin Pittsburgh to order take out and was told by the hostess to order from the bar. We originally were served by a male bartender but he gave us a few minutes to decide what we wanted.

The other bartender came to serve us and with her we ordered  Bill's Burger with a side Garden Romaine salad and a Blackened Blue Burger that came with chips.

From the beginning she had a bad attitude but whatever, I brushed it off. Immediately after I ordered, I wanted to change something and tried to call out to her before she punched it through. I said \"sorry, excuse me\" in a somewhat loud but very polite tone because it was busy for St. Patrick's Day and I said \"excuse me\" a few times after because she didn't seem to hear me and she said \"yeah, I heard you. I just wanted to make it a take out order first\" in a non-caring tone... And I get not wanting to forget the original order but wouldn't a server/bartender want to know the customer's order completely before sending it through to the kitchen?

Her attitude was not necessary and it really put me in a bad mood for a while after we ordered. She then comes over after punching in the order and asks \"alright, what do you want?\" like she was annoyed with us...

What the hell? I am sorry that it's busy and she might be having a bad shift but do not take it out on me. I'm in the customer service industry too and I get it, some days are bad but it does not mean I base the rest of my shift on a bad experience.

When we went to pick up our food we paid with the male bartender and he was so much more friendly and courteous. I wish he served us the entire time."}
{"text":"Lisa was super nice and had me back in the bar every night for 4 nights straight.

The wings were the best thing on the menu. Followed by the Pirogies.  Sushi was honestly better than some other nearby sushi places. 

I found this place a great improvement over the previous Resturant. 

I think the cost more like $$ (currently yelp has it listed at $$$)"}
