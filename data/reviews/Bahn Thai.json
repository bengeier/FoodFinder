{"text":"I work in the same plaza. i started going when they had only been open a few days since their official opening. Wonderful decor!! Wonderful food!  Ive ordered the pad se ew two times. Once for dinner. And once.for lunch. I love that the lunch comes with a spring roll. Was so great! 

The hostess is so nice! My coworkers ordered the mango and sticky rice, said it was great but just needed a little more sauce. And pad thai portion was large and excellent. 

For spice leevel it goes from 1-5 . 3 is quite heavy but doable.  I reccomend 2 for those with a hankering for spice but flavor as well!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to check out this place today.  We arrived 15 minutes before they opened and the hostess/server not only let us in but also went ahead and took our order.  The inside of the restaurant is really nice; much nicer than you would expect for the location.  They have a sushi bar in the back and then booths on each side.  

We ordered miso soup to start; for entree we got Pud Gra Pow with tofu and Pad Kee Mao with tofu.  We chose a 3 level of spice (out of 5).  The miso soup was what you would expect but the other two dishes were outstanding and the portions were large.  I especially liked the Pad Kee Mao; the spice really kicked which is right down my alley.  My girlfriend loved the Pud Gra Pow and continued eating the leftovers 20 minutes after we got home.  

When our waitress brought the check, she gave us a little after dinner drink for free (thai tea).  I don't know exactly what was in it, but it had the consistency of a liqueur and was very tasty.  

Lastly, the waitress was great and went into great detail about the spice selections.  She even came back by our table to make sure we were okay with eggs in the Pad Kee Mao since she knew we were most likely vegetarians based on our order.  

Overall, it was a great experience and we will return many times. On a side note, 3 level spice was plenty spicy."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Terriyaki chicken was inedible...pad thai and mussaman curry was fair.  Service was good though....Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a new Asian restaurant and found it here. I had the Pad Thai and it was wonderful. Great chicken soup and service"}
{"text":"Love the food and the spring roll was warm and crunchy with just the right.  Also, tasty Pad Thai!!"}
{"text":"Finally found a really good Thai place. Plenty of fresh veggies to go with your spicy Thai and protein is choice. The staff is genuinely friendly and refill beverages frequently.  The restaurant is clean and comfortable.  Another high five"}
{"text":"We have been going to Bahn Thai since they open and the food is always consistent. There are nights that the place is very busy the food takes longer but they never disappoint us on the quality and taste! Our favorite things to start off with are the lettuce wraps...yummy!"}
{"text":"We went here eat on Monday with my whole family. Our whole family was sick right after we eat from here. We was vomiting and diarrhea for the last 2 days. Someone need to check further on this matter."}
{"text":"Had a lunch date there with my husband. We had a very pleasant waitress who was  attentive. I ordered the spicy tuna roll to share as an appetizer. I was impressed. It was delicious and unique. Nice flavor and presentation. For lunch I ordered the Pud Thai with chicken. I like mine hot and spicy. It arrived and exceeded my expectations. I loved it. A very generous portion with large pieces of white meat. It was bursting with flavor. Not too hot that you couldn't taste anything else. I ended up taking it home with me and having Kentucky left over for dinner. I give it 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and I wanted some Thai food. I read the reviews and decided to try it. Wow, best Thai I had in a very long time. Spicy is 1-5 and I selected three--very hot but I could still taste my food. The restaurant was very nicely appointed  and appeared very clean.  Although I just went to pick up food I would definitely dine in. The service was friendly, fast and food delicious! I will be back when I come back to NC."}
{"text":"Love this place and go there often with family. Good for sitting on our take out. Pricing is good too add the other Thai houses are getting crazy in the prices."}
{"text":"I am giving this place a three stars because I dine at a lot of Thai restaurants. The quality of the food is good, but it is overprice for the portion that you receive. This is however typical when it is located on the upper scale side of town. 

However, it does not have me going for more unless I am in the area and feel like eating Thai food. Even then, I would probably go to Bangkok Ocha!"}
{"text":"Exceptionally good!!!! Glad I came! I'm impressed!!! Forgot the name of the noodle dish I ordered but it was recommended by the waitress and she as 100% correct!!!! Very good spring rolls! Definitely worth going to!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have ever had.  Certainly the best I've had in Charlotte.
Great service and friendly staff too.  I  have eaten there twice and love it and have a friend that eats there every week and loves it too."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed their take out several times, but went and enjoyed their excellent in restaurant service and incredible sushi. We had the fried rice and it was the best we have had.   The Sushi beat our old stand by -  will not say who - by a mile!  We will be returning soon"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been trying to find a good Thai restaurant since we moved here and so far, this is the best. Good food, great service, very clean.
They were also accommodating in helping with dietary restrictions.
On the way out I noticed that they close between lunch and dinner rush, so you will want to double check the hours if you're not going at a typical meal Time."}
{"text":"We were going to go someplace different but changed our mind. Very glad we did. Food was yummy. Service was very good. No problems. Would definitely come back. People were nice. No problems"}
{"text":"I was here today with my friends looking at all these reviews ... As soon as we went they won't even care and signs of racism ... We ordered food and the waitress was dumb .. We ordered something and we got something else ... We tried to talk to somebody who is responsible ... she had a bad attitude towards us .. We tried to explain the problem but she never listens and we were helpless ... Worst experience .. Good night be good but worst service . Never again at this place ... We left the place with incomplete dinner because of the wrong food we got"}
{"text":"Omg found a great Thai restaurant !!!!! The best in ballentyne sushi is awesome and Thai food is great also!!! Must go and try!!!!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. When I go out for Thai food I expect to smell new aromas, to taste different flavors that I don't have my own kitchen. The food we ate could have been made at home. The rice was not jasmine rice & I swear my curry tasted like it had mayonnaise in it."}
{"text":"When I go out to eat, I rarely consider a Thai restaurant, just because everything I have had in the past is just okay. This is my go to from now on.  It's clean, fresh, and flavorful.  Kudos to the chef and staff.  I ordered the Pud Se Ew with chicken.  The veggies were not overcooked, the spicy was perfect and I was surprised at the level of presentation.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, food tastes great. However, the servers were stingy with the Thai Tea. They didn't give me a full cup and said they charge extra for not having ice in it. The dumplings were remarkable, the chicken and rice were tasty, but I could get the same food from another Thai spot for half the price. \"I don't fux witcha!\""}
{"text":"food selection same as all the thai resturant in charlotte.i ordered yum tum soup..to greasy all i had in my soup is mushroom.nice place for friendly family dinner!they also have sushi!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in CLT 4 yrs running. Service has always been great and the owner is normally working in the kitchen or with the sushi chef.

Well kept secret in Ballantyne"}
{"text":"1. Food - Excellent food with a vast menu. Chicken dumplings and lettuce wraps are a must try. Entr√©es tasted fresh. Rice and noodles were very good. Spice levels can be adjusted according to our wish which was very good.
2. Ambience - nice clean place 
3. Service - was very fast. Our waitress was very polite and patient 
4. Cost - Moderately priced. Worth
 overall good experience. Will visit again"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! As soon as you walk through the door you are greeted with the tantalizing aroma of great Thai food. The atmosphere is lovely, not too small, and not too big. The place is decorated nicely with granite tables, and beautiful Thai art on the walls. The staff was extremely friendly, but what you will really love is the food. Their Pad See Ew is fantastic! The noodles cooked perfectly, and the sauce just right. I'll definitely be returning to this fantastic restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. We tried the Bahn Thai roll and it was awesome!!
Service was prompt and food was served quickly.
Will definitely return for more to try other sushi."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place in Charlotte. Their sushi, nigiri and rolls are extremely tasty. The Thai dishes are very authentic as well. I highly recommend all the stir fried noodles and Papaya salad. Also their chocolate cake is heavenly, you must try it!"}
{"text":"One and done -- terrible service experience on a (busy, but not swamped) Friday night.  We will NOT be back.

Food was fine ... passable, not special by any means.  We ordered pretty broadly across Thai staples and sushi rolls, and none of that was bad.  But you can certainly do at least as well among other local Charlotte thai spots (and Charlotte is hardly a haven for this type of cuisine).

But our daughter ordered a simple roll, which she had to wait for for more than 25 minutes after the rest of us got our food.  Our whole family was done eating before hers even arrived.  The server blew it off with \"the sushi chef is overwhelmed\" ... despite the fact that our other roll arrived on time, and we had a direct line of sight to the sushi chef to see that was plainly a lie to cover for having forgotten to put in the order.

To top it off, she refused to comp the roll.  The manager wimped out and avoided my obvious attempts via eye contact to engage him.  Weak, weak, weak.

Sometimes a restaurant has food so good you're willing to put up with poor service.  Bahn Thai is not one of those restaurants."}
{"text":"Great pad Thai and red curry. Long sushi selection. Highly recommend the Thai basil fried rice."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in Charlotte. The family that runs the restaurant is super friendly!"}
{"text":"The mark of a good restaurant is not necessarily its size, but the quality of its food and the generosity of its staff. Along that line, some of the finest dining experiences I've had throughout my career have been in the small diners and dives scattered throughout the suburbs.As we went in we got a very cold reception and told us to wait for 15 min. we did not bother much about their reception and 15min wait was reasonable for a table of 6 on a Saturday evening at 8 o clock.
As we were seated we had to wait for 15 min for some one to notice us and take an order ,as nobody showed  we had to call one of them to take our order.The lady who took the order was young.we ordered our food amongst which were tuna sushi ,thai basil & pineapple fried rice also.once the order was placed she repeated the order and she asked us for the spice level on a scale of 1 to 5 .5 meant thai hot, so we told her hot was good.once the food arrived we ate sushi and was good.With the same expectation i started eating pineapple fried rice and it was hot as hell and to confirm i asked one of my friends to take a bite and they had the same reaction too.The other fried rice my friends ordered was supposed to be equally hot as we mentioned hot for both pineapple & Basil.I took a bite of their fried rice it was not even close to Hot.So we called out for the young waitress and explained to her what the problem was her reply to us was\" when i say hot you should assume it is thai hot.Another waitress just stormed in with a slip in her hand even before we explained anything to her she started talking and telling us\"you asked for thai hot and that is what you got and that is what was written down while taking your oder\".When my husband tried to talk to her and tell her may be there was a miscommunication she told my hub\"HOLD ON\"in a very uncivil mannerly and to us that \"i cant help you if you cant handle the spice level\".Again the young waitress immediately came back with the bill and when my friend tried to place a take out for her son she replied rudely that the kitchen was closed.There was no prior notice that the kitchen was closing,in most of the restaurants they usually ask for last order before closing the kitchen.We paid for the food with 20% tip and left.There are many reputed restaurants where people replace your dish if you don't like it.Some restaurants don't even charge you for the food if you don't like it.But there they acted like they were serving free food and we had to jus eat without any complaints.
service industry is all about experience and hospitality but in case of this restaurant it is just not true.The waitress did not care to replace the dish nor took it of the bill. This review is to help others and not for free food.
Visiting Bahn Thai was certainly an experience to remember, but one that I never hope to repeat and would not wish upon anyone."}
{"text":"Wow, amazing Thai food!! So glad this opened up in ballantyne!!

Pad Thai is an easy staple and incredible at this place! Spring rolls were amazing and their papaya salad was very good (first time having it). 

I can't wait to try their items on their menu and will always order their spring rolls every time I eat there! 

The restaurant is a little small but it's perfect for take out!"}
{"text":"A beautiful presentation, great service, and wonderful food!  

Red curry, crispy duck, spring rolls, shrimp, and sushi...all incredible.  Everything they made exceeded my expectations.  The service was attentive at the right times, and very helpful with recommendations. Despite the Ballantyne prices, Bahn Thai gives you a bang for your buck in the way of fresh, quality ingredients. The sushi rolls are gourmet with a variety of ingredients stuffed into one roll. I'll be back.

Try:  The crispy duck with some heat"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants I have ever visited. Im a vegetarian and ordered pad Thai and pad won sen. Really Amazing! Everything was cooked just right! Nothing more or less! I would definitely recommend this place to Thai food lovers!"}
{"text":"This is seriously one of the best Thai restaurants we've been to in Charlotte. Not only is the atmosphere warm and friendly, the food is SO delicious and cooked by an actual thai chef. The portions are large and the prices are fantastic especially compared to other Thai restaurants in the area. This restaurant is now a regular of ours and will be for a long time coming!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times. The chicken pad Thai is delicious! Same goes for the egg drop soup! It's definitely a good lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed dinner at Bahn Thai.  Stopped in while waiting for a haircut across the street and was pleasently surprised.

Sat at the bar and had a couple pieces of sashimi.  The chef asked if I had tried a different type of tuna from what I got, and when I said I hadn't he made me a sample of nigiri for that that type of tuna.

Ordered Pud See Ew with a 3 out of 5 on the spicy scale.  Thought it was great and a large portion.  The sushi chef also recommended a couple different sauces for me to try, and when I had to pack up some to take home they gave me containers to put the other sauces in.

Overall, really happy to see a casual Thai place pop up near my home.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"After all the hype, this place was a pretty big letdown. The ambiance is pretty cliche 'strip mall asian' restaurant. My friend and I shared the chicken lettuce wraps which were good, but nothing to write home about. For our entrees, my friend got the pad see-ew and I got the pad guey teow, both with shrimp. We both are not spicy food eaters so we went with the minimal spice level on both meals. Apparently no spice means no flavor at all! Both entrees were extremely bland, to the point where we had to ask for salt, pepper, and some spicy sauce to give it some flavor. The pad guey teow had a fishy taste to it. Not sure if this is because a couple of the shrimp hadn't been de-veined and cooked in with it, but it was rather foul tasting. I am puzzled by all of the wonderful reviews because not one of our plates were worth the money or even the meal. Save your time and go to Basil."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this hidden gem! Been there over a dozen of times and have done take out about the same. Very consistent items time and time again. The spice is spot on! Service is good, they adopt the whole wait staff approach where it seems as if all the servers are available to each guest. The overall appearance misses the \"chic\" that are shooting for but again, it's all about the food. Side note - never had the sushi. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Very good food and fast. Friendly staff. Great location with lots of pre/post dinner options."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Thai restaurants I've ever been to! I've lived in LA, DC, and Houston and spent lots of time in SF. All of those cities have incredible food, particularly Asian food, and even more particularly Thai food. I can honestly say that this place is probably the best, or close to the best, of any of the places I've been. They also have incredible sushi, which is a huge bonus. In general, I haven't found great ethnic cuisine in Charlotte, but this restaurant is a welcome exception and it can hold it's own with the best Thai restaurants in the biggest cities. It's my go-to place in Ballantyne!"}
{"text":"So good, everything is fantastic. The service is also impeccable. It's great to have the sushi options along with the Thai. We go on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Really nice little Thai place.  Good variety even though somewhat small menu for a Thai place.  They do allow substitutions and have a very good wine & sake selection.  Excellent service."}
{"text":"This place is great - I can't wait to go back.

I have been on the lookout for good Thai food since moving from NY down to Charlotte and had been unsuccessful until now!  From now on, whenever I'm craving Thai, this is my go-to place.

The restaurant is clean and laid out nicely.  Our waitress was super friendly and attentive as well.  

For our appetizer, we ordered the chicken steamed dumplings and they were ok - they weren't actually hot and I felt like they had just been kind of warmed up or had been sitting out for a while.

I got pud see-ew & loved it!  The flavors were great and everything was very fresh and delicious.  My husband got a curry dish and LOVED it.  His was better than mine!"}
{"text":"Really good vegetarian options! The Tom yum soup is very good as well. The sushi is really good and fresh- I wish they served sushi on Sunday's as that is typically when we visit. Service is fast and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Best Thai for the money in S Charlotte and I've tried them all. I had the Massaman Curry -- best I've had anywhere in Charlotte. The only reason I'm not rating it a 5 is just that the service was very slow. But if you aren't in a super rush, it's hard to beat Bahn Thai."}
{"text":"Best Thai place in Charlotte, hands down! But I apologize to all my papaya salad lovers because I am not a papaya salad fan and I can not handle the spice so this is a review on basically everything else. 

Service is always great and all the servers are very attentive and friendly. Yes, I've been here so much that I did my fair share of having the chance to get served by all of the servers. 

Food is always delicious and consistent. One thing that gets to me about other Thai places in charlotte is that they are never consistent. Whether it's too sweet, salty, or way too much coconut milk in the curries. But bahn Thai always does it just right. And I would never in a life time think about ordering sushi here because... It's obviously a Thai place but the sushi here is pretty awesome. And the quality of the fish is great. 

These are my all time favorite dishes. 
Thai Tea- the legit kind too, not the bottle kind. 
Sake Nigiri (omg.. melts in your mouth) 
Salmon Crunch 
Ballantyne Roll
Bahn Thai Roll
Gaeng Karee- Mild Curry (C6) even better the next day for leftovers
Pud Woon Sen 
Pud See Ew - they should rename this dish  Pud See Freakin' Yum!!! 
CRISPY DUCK!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Awesome staff! Must have the sticky rice for dessert! Once you go to Bahn Thai, it will be your go-to Thai place!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We have been so many times and tried so many of their dishes but nothing disappoints! The papaya salad is so delicious, the sushi is pretty good too and my favorite it Pud Kuang Gaeng. It is soooo good! But be careful Bahn thai loves spicy!! haha We usually get our dishes at spicy level 3 and its pretty darn spicy!! 

If you love thai food, def give this place a try! You will not be disappointed =)"}
{"text":"I loved this place.  We often go there for speedy lunch.  They have good picks in the Sushi bar.  They have tons of options for vegetarian like me. I love the Pad Thai Noodles and Red Curry."}
{"text":"What an awesome surprise. Lettuce wraps and green curry rock! between the above average beer selection and friendly service, we were happy enough to start planning our next trip. Don't look for moody, candlelight dining, but if great Thai food in a clean, accessible setting is enough, you'll love it."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. All Thai food entr√©e taste amazing. My parents and I had a wonderful time there. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A 1 star, yes. On a restaurant that has so many great reviews. The reviews are the reason we tried this place. 

We are always at viva chicken (they are a solid 5), and decided to get take out from here instead this time, change it up a bit. Well, never again. 

We ordered a tofu fried rice, tofu pad thai, and an avocado and tofu roll. We got home (in Fort mill, so about 25 minutes away) and I opened up the sushi first and WOW, it looked like my 2 year old made it, and each roll was the size of a bottle cap. I didn't think an avocado or tofu roll could be messed up, but it was and I just couldn't believe it. 

My husband called and asked to speak to a manager and the girl who answered asked why, and he told her that sushi looked like a child made it and was almost microscopic. She really could care less, had a major attitude, and didn't want to put the manager on the phone. She then made a comment like \"yea well take that to heart\" and my husband just hung up. 
He called back again because he was in disbelief how this girl was talking to us, after we just spent hard earned mone and weren't satisified. He insisted we speak to a manager who was apologetic, and told my husband he could come in for a full refund whenever it was convenient. 

We ate the dinner and the pad thai was so dry and was nothing but noodles and tofu, no oeanuts, or scallions, or anything else that was supposed to be on it. The fried rice was decent and just like any fried rice you can get somewhere else. 

30 minutes later my husband gets a call from a different woman (this is now the 3rd woman we are speaking to) who says she will \"gladly refund the sushi but not the rest of our order because you only had an issue with the sushi\" little did she know we actually ate the food and wasnt happy with most of it. Anyways, we told her we were already promised a full refund for being disrepescted. 

Apparently the woman who told us we can get a full refund wasn't the manager, and this woman would not budge on the full refund. 

We finally said, you know what, you guys are obviously hurting real bad that you can't give us a full refund ($35) so don't even mind refunding the sushi. She said ok. 

That was our first and last time there."}
{"text":"I've already been there twice. The service is really prompt and they got the food as spicy as we like. I liked the Pud Pong Graree, the traditional thai curry and in desert, mango slices with sticky rice, sprinkled with coconut and sesame seeds is what I most liked. 
Would surely go there again."}
{"text":"One evening I was coming home from the airport and was craving Thai food in the worst way. This place was close to the freeway and had been reviewed buy a few friends so I decided to give it a try. I am fairly new to eating Thai food, but know a good pad thai from a bad one and so I was hopeful that this would be better than several, less-than-stellar iterations I've had locally recently.

Upon entering the restaurant, I was immediately greeted and seated but I noticed it was freezing cold and it was uncomfortable for at least 10 minutes while I was trying to decide what to eat. Fortunately the restaurant was very clean and pleasant in every other way, as was my server. Pleasant that is!

I am happy to say that I was pleased with the pad thai ordered as well as the Philadelphia Maki roll I had as an appetizer. Both items came quickly and my pad thai was hot and had just the right amount of heat. I asked for a level 2, and it was enough that my gums were tingly 10 minutes after I finished eating. LOL
The sushi roll was adequate for its price range and the fish was fresh and tasty. It was perfect for an appetizer or for including in a multi roll meal. I only wish they had garnished the pad thai with a few more fresh vegetables or something to take away from the fact that it was just Pad Thai heaped on a plate. A simple Improvement in presentation would go a long way.

The food was good enough that I will consider returning on my next trip to the airport to try something else, which is more than I can say from several restaurants I've tried recently! I give it 4 stars because I have not yet felt like it was out of this world. I will reevaluate after eating there a few more times."}
{"text":"A sweet girl named Ploy welcomed us in. Really nice people work here! 

¬∑Lunch special - massaman curry with Onion, cilantro, potato, zucchini - Absolutely Wonderful!!! 

¬∑Lunch Special - Hibachi - my friend loved it!!

¬∑Thai Ice Tea- a tad too sweet for me. The lady was nice and brought me some more cream to make it taste better."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai food in town. The papaya salad is spicy with a nice balance of sweet and sour. It's light and refreshing, especially in the summer. The noodle in the pad Thai is cooked nicely, not too soft. I like coming here for lunch with a nice selection of munch menu with decent price and nice portions."}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai restaurant in the area...and we've tried many! Two words: Panang Curry. I lived in Asia for a year, and this is the best I've had. You must try it! We've had other dishes that have been excellent as well but always go back to the Panang Curry. Lovely staff as well!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh sushi!!!!!  The noodle dishes on the adjoining tables looked incredible.  AND they do my favorite chicken noodle soup!  Hooray for a new fave!"}
{"text":"Mango sticky rice is a must try!! Had the pad Thai, sushi lunch special, and spring rolls- everything was delicious!! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This is our go to sushi place.  Food is great.  Service is ok,  never been wowed by that.  Keep chomping back because the flavours are so great!"}
{"text":"The waiters and waitresses here are helpful, and the menu has a list (in English) of what is included in each dish. The atmosphere when I went was quiet and there were only a few other tables of people dining. Their prices were reasonable for the portions provided."}
{"text":"Pretty good food! We started with the sashimi sampler. The fish tasted great; it was neither fishy nor chewy. To follow, we had the Ballantyne roll and the California roll. Both rolls were delicious, although I was expecting the Ballantyne roll to be larger."}
{"text":"I loved it, thought it very authentic! Lettuce wraps mix was delicious.  Also tried green curry with scallops. Very good!"}
{"text":"Chicken dish smelled fish and bad service.  It took us 25 minutes to pay the bill as no one attended after giving us the bill."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi, best I've had in this area.  I was there with co-workers and we all got different things, but we shared some sushi.  The Ballantyne roll was out favorite.  Service is prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"We tried Bahn Thai for the first time last weekend and LOVED it!  I had a vegetable curry dish and the Hubs had sushi.  The curry dish (c1) was great (I love a restaurant with lots of veggie options), and my husband said it was some of the best sushi he's had in Charlotte.  I think it was the \"sunshine roll\" that he loved most, but he was really a huge fan of everything.  The service was very attentive and friendly and our food was delivered quickly and prepared correctly.  We'll definitely be back to Bahn Thai.

Just one note - this Yelp listing says it's in Quail Hollow, it's not even close to Quail Hollow - it's in the heart of Ballantyne."}
{"text":"What a find! I had the Yum Woon Sen, and Spicy California Handroll. I eat a lot of Thai food, and Yum Woon Sen is my staple dish. This place ROCKED IT! Holy yum!!! (Pun intended)! Ate there twice in one week. Love that place!"}
{"text":"Love Thai food. My favorite was the sticky rice with some kinda desert sauce. And usually I don't eat carbs but made an exception. Had the squid soup which was amazing and a bunch of appetizers. Overall would recommend. P.s. Thai house - the best soup ever ;)"}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Very delicious Thai food.  I got the green curry with chicken. I was impressed because the curry was thick and full of flavor. It had the consistency of a stew.  The spice was good.  I probably could have gotten a 4 out of 5 on the spice level,  but I was happy with the 3. The chicken was all breast meat as usual in the states. It was cooked just to tender and not overdone. They also had large chunks of eggplant. Unfortunately,  they used peas and carrots so it made it feel a little americanized. Otherwise,  I liked the place and would recommend to anyone looking for a good Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"The wife and I have been to Bahn Thai on a few occasions and have always had great food. I typically get the green curry, actually I have always had the green curry here. I usually get it 4 out of 5 spicy, which still has some pretty good kick to it.  It's always nice to ask for something spicy and actually receive it just how you like it. On my last visit, I also tried some of their sushi as an appetizer and the nigiri was all fresh tasting fish. The service has always been great as well.

The wife and I have recently moved away from south Charlotte, but I would not hesitate to stop in if we find ourselves in the area or even making a specific trip to Bahn Thai. I just have to venture out on their menu and get something different, but man those eggplants in the green curry get me every time."}
{"text":"Very tasty dinner! Food, service and variety of menu options were great! For apps, we ordered the Calamari, which was done in shoe strings which I absolutely love, but they were a bit tough/over cooked, but I still enjoyed regardless. Fresh spring rolls were also good.

For dinner, I ordered Pad Kee Mao, which was superb. I really can't think of any other place that I thought was better. 4 stars was plenty spicy for me! My fianc√© got the red curry with seafood combo and I think we were both surprised by both the quantity and quality included in the entree. The actual curry was delightful as well. It didn't seem to be as heavy and coconut milk forward as with other places. 

We thoroughly enjoyed our meal, just had to subtract a star for the tough calamari and the price - still trying to understand how a party of 3 racked up a $100 bill at a Thai restaurant! Oh well, at least it was delicious."}
{"text":"I decided to stop in here for lunch after reading other Yelp reviews.  I decided to go with one of my fav Thai standbys - chicken Pad Thai.  I can't remember if I went with spicy level 2 or 3, but, it was just right - the dish had great flavor and just the right amount of heat.  Service was friendly and efficient on my visit. The sushi  bar looked good too from what I could see. In any case, I will definitely coming back to check out some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"Had a craving for Thai food, and after reading reviews, decided to try Bahn Thai.  Very nice decor and atmosphere, friendly staff.  Had the Pud Thai, which was delicious.  Definitely had the right ratio of ingredients, and was (thankfully) not greasy.  Salad and ginger dressing also very good.  Great service."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting such a great experience for a Thai Place in Ballantyne, but I am happy to report a fantastic experience with hopes of visiting again really, really soon. We came in for an early-ish dinner on a Friday evening. 

The place is really clean and has great attention to detail. Plenty of tables, booths, and ample seating at the (sushi) bar. We grabbed a booth and our server promptly took our order(s). 

We forwent apps and went straight to entrees paired with a few Sing Ha beers. Ordered the Pud See Ew, #2 spicy, and chicken. It was fantastic. Those wide noodles are executed so perfectly and retain such a unique and smoky flavor. The #2 level of spice was enjoyable and served up a balanced twinge of heat throughout. About the same as a moderate helping of Sriracha. 

My wife ordered a veggie dish with the same wide noodles. Can't remember the name, but the flavor was so peppery. I'd order that myself. 

Our server is was really rounded out our experience. She was so, so, so friendly and explained the menu thoroughly. 

5 solid stars for this Thai joint. I'd head back in a heartbeat. Only wish it wasn't all the way down in Ballantyneland."}
{"text":"I was glad to see the place open on a Monday night.  We were greeted with smiles from across the room and from the sushi chef.  It was around 530 and only 3 tables occupied which had me concerned.  But our waitress came right over and took our drink order.  
We ordered a couple of sushi rolls and a Spring roll.  Took about 12 minutes to receive (remember 3 other tables), but all the apps were very good.
I ordered a grilled cod fillets entree and phad thai; my son had a dish with wide noodles.  
They restaurant was filling up while we waited for our entrees.  Others were served before us that came in after our appetizers were served.  I was told that they wanted to be sure the fish was cooked.  About 15 minutes later four hot steaming meals came to our table.  My fish was great but coated with a slightly bland sauce, and I ordered it 3 chili style.  Side if broccoli was cold.
I loved the phad Thai, best I've had in Charlotte.  Tender noodles, spicy peanut sauce with a hint of sweetness.  
The others enjoyed their meals without any issues.
Nice addition to Ballantyne."}
{"text":"My go to Thai place in the area. Authentic flavor, great service, and superb food. I always get the drunken noodles or any variation of the wide noodles with seafood combo. They never disappoint!

if you are into spicy food, ask for Thai spicy. And if that's not enough, ask for the spice rack and add their homemade sauces to any dish. Guaranteed to not disappoint. 

Their apps and salad (especially the papaya salad) are great. 

They also have amazing dessert - molten chocolate cake, sticky rice, fried ice cream!"}
{"text":"Pineapple fried rice was good. So was curry. Not excellent but good for Charlotte. Service was friendly. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food in Charlotte. Restaurant is relatively cozy and tastefully decorated. Service is attentive and rather impeccable but the food is the true standout. 

Though I've never been to Thailand (yet), I've been quite an aficionado of Thai food since I first discovered this wonderful cuisine in the late 80s. Thus, I cannot attest to authenticity, just to taste. 

Every item I tried was perfectly cooked, flavorful and vibrant. I strongly recommend the som thum (green papaya salad) as we'll as the fresh summer rolls. For dinner I had trouble deciding which entree I enjoyed the most. It's a total draw:  I really loved all the entrees I shared.  The pud Thai (that's how it's spelled there), the pineapple fried rice, and the red curry with pineapple were all wonderful. And mango sticky rice for dessert was a befitting end to a terrific meal. 

This was my first visit but I plan in becoming a regular. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Good food... Spicy is really extremely spicy even my Indian spice standards.... I really enjoyed my panang curry !"}
{"text":"Shrimp basil rolls '& Pud Kee Maow were my choices tonight . 
The roll was good but not much shrimp in the roll . Seems like the shrimp is shaved in half before it's placed in the roll. A lot of filler but not much shrimp.  It was lacking ! 

The Pud Kee Maow was good but not nearly what I expected. The broccoli was overcooked . It was Flavorful but just not fabulous. 
All in all it was tasty but just okay. 
The place was empty so I'm not sure if NFL football tonight had the crowds at the pubs or if this was a typical night here."}
{"text":"Service: We weren't seated right away even though there were 4-5 servers there with a couple of open tables. It also took awhile to get out checks... Like a good 10 minutes. 

Food: I ordered tofu pad thai at a level of 2 and I tasted nothing to be frank. My friends ordered levels of 4-5 with their varying dishes and it still wasn't even that spicy. Taste-wise, it was good. 

I'd come back to try some other dishes but hopefully they'll pay attention to us more.."}
{"text":"Been to Bahn Thai again and the food and service was excellent as always. The Restaurant is not big I can't help but over hear the table near us complaining about their food. The poor girl she didn't do anything wrong and a lot of the servers  even went over to see what's wrong but I guess they want free food and wanted
to complain. The funny thing was they ate all the food! Lol 
All in all the food is great and I recommend a lot of my friends here and they all love it!"}
{"text":"Really like the atmosphere here, and has a good selection of food for lunch (haven't been for dinner yet, but likely will!). They're always very speedy and polite and let me switch my veggies up on my entree with no extra cost! It is very close to my work and though I have an hour, they haven't come close to taking that long all the times I've been here. Would definitely recommend for a busy schedule, and the lunch entree with soup and spring roll is really the perfect size. Great place, excited to have found it."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the Charlotte area. My favorites include the pud gra pow with chicken - delicious classic mix of chicken, veggies, basil, bell peppers, and carrots; the pud Thai with shrimp - as perfect of a version of this go-to dish that you'll find anywhere; and last but not least, the gaeng keow wan - the BEST green curry I've ever had. Perfect hint of spice in delicious coconut milk with peas, carrots, and eggplant. Over jasmine rice, this is AMAZINGLY good. The curry can't be beat. They can be a bit slow in terms of service, but no big deal. I never would have expected to find one of my favorite Thai places in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Great place for some Thai food and offers sushi! Located in Pineville off Johnson Road on i485 service is excellent and food preparation in a timely matter. Environment well lit with a bar. Not too small not large but good enough for a group for dinner. Recommended for people that want a taste of good quality Thai food! Only downside that makes me give it 4 Star is pricing, but hey gotta run a business right? All in all great service and great food!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest I wasn't a huge fan. It was okay but I will drive a little further for better Thai food. The spice level wasn't on point and it basically tasted kind of like Americanized Chinese food. Don't get me wrong it was not disgusting or bad food it just seemed catered to American customers. That probably helps them out in the long run but for me I was looking for something else entirely. I'm sure there may be a time I come back but I honestly can't even think when that would be lol. If I remember correctly we ordered spring rolls, chicken satay, tom yum soup, a \"spicy\" beef and green beans dish, and a \"spicy\" chicken dish. The beef and green beans dish was not good at all, and I would not recommend. Everything else was just average."}
{"text":"If you are craving some spicy Thai in a casual, yet well decorated atmosphere, look no further. Bahn Thai is new to Charlotte serving up some deliciously spicy dishes. 

The spice level is on a 1-5 scale. Being cautious of a new place I tend to start on the low end until I get a feel for the spiciness. Wow, even level 2 is spicy! Ask for the spice tray too...4 different types of dips or dry spice to add flavor to your meal. Bring a few tissues with you as the nose starts to run and the eyes water because the cloth napkin just won't do. I ordered the Pud Thai and hubs got the Pad-see-ew. Both were great and plentiful! The sushi is good too, but upon return I think I'll skip the sushi and just hone in on the Thai dishes. When mangos are in season, I love to get some sticky mango rice dessert. Their version is pretty standard and good.

The service is good and friendly. Felt like our water glasses never got empty. 

It's a nice, new Thai restaurant...and I left completely full and satisfied."}
{"text":"This place is decent. The tofu was a little over-cooked. Service was reasonable, and the food came out rather quick."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with friends. First time for all 3 of us during lunch hours. We were seated in less than 10 minutes. Bahn Thai has been recommended on a number of occasions and I'm so glad we finally made it! Two of us got the red curry with chicken (no basil or bamboo shoots), level three and our other friend opted for a noodle dish with chicken. Man oh man it was SO good!!! The soup that came with the lunch, I can definitely do without but that curry is a MUST!! $10 per person, can't beat that :)"}
{"text":"I consider myself a Thai food snob. I was told to come here for the excellent sushi. Upon arrival the sushi bar was closed for the next few weeks. I tried the lunch special - chicken and broccoli in oyster sauce. The soup that came with the meal was a rice soup. It was mushy and bland. Then they swapped it our for a Miso soup and it was not better. The rice was mushy. The chicken was okay and the egg roll was good. I left underwhelmed. About 30 minutes later I threw the food back up. Needless to say, I dumped the leftovers immediately. Probably won't try this place again. Server was great but food left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"We are getting to be regular pimps for Bahn Thai, continually bringing neighbors to try it out.

A number of people are afraid of Thai food being too hot or spicy.  To their credit at Bahn Thai they do reassure diners that the spice will be low, but, sad to say, the kitchen does, on occasion over dose and you get sizzler.  When that has happened, they graciously take the plate back and re-cook it for the low spice crowd.

On the other hand, if you REALLY want to light up your life they will bring a condiment tray to the table with four pepper varieties that will water your eyes as well burn your nostrils.  So go for it if you dare, although their five spice levels should please you.

Their volcano fish and ginger fish specials are very good.  The ginger fish comes with two generous half-inch thick cuts of fish with around a three inch diameter.  A good satisfying portion.

Service is so nice.  The wait people don't rush your ordering and will delay staging your meal so you have time to chat, snack, drink over an appetizer or two or three before ordering your main courses.  I like that as I dislike getting the main dish while we are still on appetizers.

Don't be afraid...come on in and enjoy the experiment without suffering bodily harm.  You won't regret it.  Just look at the reviews!"}
{"text":"Very tasty and fresh, I had the basil fried rice with chicken.  I am allergic to fish and nuts and I have had good safe service here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a Saturday night at 7pm and did not have to wait, plus we got a seat outside! I ordered the shrimp tempura sushi in which the waiter told us it might be a longer wait for my food. It was worth it! Very good sushi! My husband got the Pud Thai noodle bowl. He always had pad Thai at any Thai restaurant we try. This was his favorite! He even let me try it and it was delicious! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today and came away quite impressed.  My coworkers and I all ordered very different items and we were all quite pleased with the results.  I will be coming back sooner rather than later!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Oh baby. I love Ban Tai. Such good Daeng Gang. Am I  saying that right? I hope so. The first time my husband and I  went for gaeng dang I did not and nobody corrected me until we left. Not cool. Anyway. There's is the best! Sushi  awesome! Thom kha, awesome. Oh btw, they have deep fried oreos and fried bananas for dessert. Are you drooling now?"}
{"text":"Had a great Pud Thai and california roll here recently - my friend ordered the fried bananas and ice cream dessert which was really good!  Nice place in a shopping center, staff was friendly, food was good and served hot, and restaurant interior was comfortable.  Great place to stop in for lunch - service was reasonably quick."}
{"text":"(3/21/15) Ok, so its been awhile since we were last here, but I have thought about it a lot. I'm having a great Thai tea cool & sweet. We ordered a variety of appetizers including beef satay, fried tofu, steamed dumplings and a bowl of Tom kha for me. My wife is having the beef with wide noodles again and I'm trying the red curry.

The one consistent thing that we both noticed about our dishes was that the meat was overcooked in every single dish! Not good. With the exception of the meat everything was excellent."}
{"text":"I Love Great Thai Food!!!  Opened May 1st!  The food was Very Good and based on them only being Open for 10 days it seems they have Great Potential!!!

Beef Satay tasted Great without the Peanut Sauce and even better with it!

Peanut Sauce!  This is the kind I Love!  

Onion Carrot Cucumber side with the Satay was Very Good!

Pud Gra Pow - Beef with Thai Basil Stir Fry... Very Nice! Ordered with a Spiciness of two out of five...Two is quite spicy!  Spice level is similar to most Thai Restaurants (the Better ones)!!!

Brave use of Garlic!  More than most places I will say it is about perfect for me!

Crab and Cucumber Salad was very nice!

Thom Kha (Coconut Milk Soup) included more Chicken than most versions of twice the size!  More than one source if Spiciness gave this one a Moore complex flavor! Nice flavor though still needs some work

They gave me a Taste of the Green Tea Ice Cream!!!  Reminds me of the Fine Flavors designed for  \"i\" years ago!!!  It was that good!  My Waitress said they order it from a ________ for Japanese Food!  This version of Green Tea Ice Cream was PERFEKT as I have eaten! Described as \"mildly sweet\"... I thought it was Perfectly sweet with a fine Green Tea flavor with no overpowering Tea, tea taste!  

NOT to the Onwers : : This Ice Cream does NOT need to be served with \"whipped cream\", nor Chocolate sauce!!!  It stands on its own very well!  OK you can decorate to sides on a dish without putting all that extra 'stuff'\" \"on\" the Ice Cream!

For Dessert they tempted me with a shot glass of Thai Tea, presented on a white dish !  Very Nice Flavor! They are SMART !  !   !

Thai Coffee was Very Nice too, though a distant second to Vietnamese Coffee!

Mango with Sticky Rice needs work and was better when we put some of the green Tea Ice Cream on Top!"}
{"text":"Great service every time and the food is always consistently good. One of my favorite Thai restaurants! 
Also, gotta try the coconut ice cream for dessert!"}
{"text":"Great great great food.  You can not find better service then this. I recommend to all Thai food lover!!"}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to Thai restaurant in the South Charlotte area. We love the gaeng massaman and have always been pleased with the sushi as well. It is expensive so it's a treat for us. Service is friendly."}
{"text":"Solid Thai place for Charlotte. (Again, graded slightly on a curve because it's Charlotte.)

We tried:

Papaya Salad - Definite standout. Loved the mix of tangy flavors and crunchy papaya and everyone who tried it gave a thumbs up as well. (Also they were able to make it non-spicy upon request, which I loved because usually I love papaya salad, but can't eat too much because of the spice).

Summer Roll - Solid rendition, and better executed than the one at Be's. It's got a better a balance of ingredients inside the roll and the sauce on the side ads a nice bit of flavor. 

Pad Thai - Found this to be too gloopy and sweet and it was definitely the least favorite dish at the table.

Among the other noodles, I honestly couldn't tell what they were but I think we ordered a few different versions of pad see ew / pad kee mow (wide noodle dishes). The seafood version was actually quite good, and if you like spice, ask them for Thai level spice and they will deliver.

In general wasn't super impressed by the mains, but would come back just for the appetizers."}
{"text":"Entering inside you would notice it's not any regular Dark and Gloomy Thai restaurant that has dimmed lights - instead it's the opposite - large windows, well spaced tables, spacious booths and a really big bar area. The menu is a regular Thai - Appetizers, Curries, Stir Fry and Pad Thai. One surprising section though was Japanese! And even more surprising was the Sushi Menu that came with its own card! I wasn't ready to try a sushi at a Thai restaurant so went with the usual Thai dishes.

We got some coconut soups to start with - The soup was flavorful but loaded with a ton of veggies which will make you 'eat' the soup rather thank 'drink' the soup. For entree, we decided to order three dishes and share between ourselves so we don't get bored. We got some fried rice, pad Thai and paneng curry. 

The service was quick and our waitress kept checking our table often. The taste was not exceptional and rather blend without having any real kick to it. The Pad Thai seemed okay but it was too sweet for my taste buds. The paneng curry was a let down - felt like they added too much peanuts over coconut in the curry that made you feel like drinking a bowl of watery peanut butter! 

Overall it is the kind restaurant where you could enjoy the ambience and the hospitality but the taste of the food is little too bland that makes you think about not bookmarking this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Three 1/2 stars
First thing I noticed when we walked in was the decor in a West Elm style - possibly by an earlier tenant? A pleasant break from the usual Bangkok palace anyway.

The lunch specials were $9-12 according to the protein of your choice and include soup or salad. The soup of the day was egg drop something -no thanks- so we went with the salad, Chicken Pad Thai, Shrimp Tum Yum ($6)  and Crispy duck ($18) - same as we did in the last few Thai places we tried.

-The lettuce was crispy, the ginger dressing tangy and tastier than we're typically served. It also wasn't thickened as usual but that was fine too. 

-The Tum Yum made for a fine medium spicy soup with many ingredients - mushrooms, shrimp, tomato etc- but no trace of lemongrass and malanga. The waitress told  me they don't put lemongrass in the bowl because customers objected to bits of \"wood\" in their soup but the chef uses it to make the broth. Maybe true, the soup had some nice flavor but my taste buds could not recognize it as Tum Yum : 3 stars

-the Pad Thai was very tasty but fell just a little short overall because there was no crunch to it (no bean sprouts or anything of the sort) and it was made with thin noodles instead of the wider, flat kind :  3 stars

- Crispy Duck: now we're talking! I've had good, bad and indifferent Asian duck around town but this one was the only one that came close to the experience of *Crispy* Thai duck. What looked like a whole half duck chopped into thick slices with a cleaver, crispy meat with lots of crunchy skin (like rind) to nibble. That's what I was looking for. The meat had been deboned, which I didn't notice at first because it had been carefully put back together for a traditional presentation -a compromise I can live with. Excellent duck:    Four stars

Now, I'm NOT going to claim this or that Thai restaurant makes THE BEST DUCK HANDS DOWN, nope! Apples and oranges, they all use different recipes. Thai Orchid's for one, serves a duck dish that's every bit as tasty -if not more- than Ban Thai's.   

However Ban Thai was the only restaurant in my admittedly limited sampling which -in spite of claims to the contrary- actually serves Crispy Thai Duck ."}
{"text":"Pleasant and rather clean atmosphere inside with a combo of booths and tables. A few tables on patio/sidewalk outside.  Service is efficient and perfunctory. Food is mild for spice level but did not ask to increase level since this was first visit. Glad I went and may return someday if in the area and hungry for Thai."}
{"text":"Something for everyone. I had sushi and my mom had a Thai curry. We both left content."}
{"text":"Had to wait 18 minutes for wait staff
11 additional minutes to be served water & drink
Quality of food is now of no concern
Can't tolerate absence of customer service"}
{"text":"After reading great reviews on yelp, I decided to satisfy my thai food cravings. The place looks newly constructed and clean. I couldn't wait to try the sushi after looking at the scrumptious looking pictures on yelp. So, i ordered Spicy Salmon Maki roll and boy it was delicious. I also ordered Pad Kee Mou with tofu and spicy level 3, it was just perfect for my preference. The entree is big enough to be shared or to be taken home aa leftover. I was very pleased with the food, i am already planning to go back and try other items :)"}
{"text":"Its really tough to do everything with excellence.  They try here by offering a lot of various asian foods and keeping the ambience friendly and casual.  I was just here for the sushi and was both pleased and a little disappointed.  Here are my nuggets for consideration:

- No warm towel available to clean your hands before handling your sushi.  Overall not the traditional Japanese sushi experience, if that's what you're looking for.
- Tamago didn't seem to be made there and was pretty bland as a result.
- Maguro was very good.  Nice texture and taste with very little fat.
- A really good family atmosphere.  Definitely a nice place to bring the kids.  Casual.
- not a place for sushi snobs, as thats not their focus I believe.
- Miso soup was pretty basic, mostly broth.
- Overall, I'd recommend the place for a good, quick meal as long as you're not looking for the full sushi experience.

I hope the review helps."}
{"text":"I love my food every time I come! The shrimp pud Thai keeps me coming back for more. The service is always professional and friendly, and the environment is always clean. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time last weekend with my parents. My mom is a little bit of a Pad Thai snob, so she said it was just alright. I, however, loved it! It was sweet and just a little spicy (because I'm a wimp and asked for level one spice). The sushi was a lot better than I anticipated and it wasn't too pricey. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sushi and Thai food??? Odd mixture of culture,  but still tasty.  The California and shrimp tempura sushi rolls were excellent.   Also, the papaya salad was great.  Everything else was moderate and lacked the \"wow\" factor. It was reasonable as far as price, so it could be worth the trip."}
{"text":"The food here is really great! But  when there are a lot of people in there be prepared to be overlooked. Took us 20mins just for someone to come ask us our drink order!"}
{"text":"I didn't realize this place was here until a client invited me to meet him there.  Food was delicious!  So glad this spot is close to work.  It will become one of my go to spots for Thai!!"}
{"text":"I drive right by here almost every day - what took me so long to try it?? The fella and I stopped in on a Wednesday night and were seated immediately. Booths are around the perimeter, tables are in the middle, and a pretty decent-sized bar is in the back.

We were both pretty boring - I got the pud thai with chicken, and fella got the pud puk with chicken. I cleaned my plate, and the fella came close! My pud thai wasn't as sweet as Basil's, which is my go-to, but it was just as delicious. Throw in two glasses of house wine, and we only spent $35. Service was pretty solid, too. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Today I got a to go order from here. I tried something new  and it was delicious. I usually go with pad Thai at Thai restaurants but I decided to get the Pud prew wan. It was like a sweet and sour stir fry. So delicious.  The restaurant  was very efficient and my order was ready before I finished my beer. I plan on returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"It just didn't do it for me. All you Yelpers are crazy for this place but wow...I must have had a pretty bad experience compared to you all. We went on a Saturday night, and it wasn't terribly busy. The restaurant isn't big in the first place, and it was only about half full. We were seated and water was eventually brought out. 

We ordered some spring rolls (I think...this was 2 weeks ago, forgive me!) for an appetizer and I ordered Pud Thai for dinner. The spring rolls were pretty good, and the sauce even better. Immediately after it looked like we were finished, our waitress ran to our table \"Can I take this from you!?!?!?\" \"...no thank you!\". A few minutes later \"Can I take this from you!?!?!\" \"...no thanks!\" She even put her finger on the dish before asking--my mom's biggest pet peeve. It is quite disgusting.

Our entrees came out, and my Pud Thai was...okay. I didn't love it, sure didn't hate it, it was just in the middle somewhere. My dinner was interrupted by a few more \"Can I take that for you!??!\"'s which was exceedingly annoying. Oh well. The portion was huge, though. I ended up getting a stomach ache after it was all said and done. My parents both said they enjoyed theirs, which makes me give the third star. I don't want to ding them too much on my taste buds alone.

Maybe it was a one-off, but I really didn't love Bahn Thai. I probably wouldn't head back, but who knows."}
{"text":"Been there a few times.  I love the tai dishes. The staff is always friendly. Not a big fan that they close in between shifts. The sushi there is not bad, its just nothing special. I'm not a fan of minced tuna, so maybe it's just me. Always clean store though."}
{"text":"Whether it's Sak√© or sushi... This place is my favorite spot!!! Great food & even better staff!!!"}
{"text":"I was moved to write a review of Bahn Thai not only because their food is spectacular, but also because their service is excellent.

This past Sunday my cousin and I tried to go to Bahn Thai, but were disappointed to find them closed. As we were about to leave someone came and opened the door. They were very understanding of our situation and allowed us to eat lunch in the restaurant while it was closed (they were there cooking for a catering event).

The Pud Thai (pad thai) was some of the best I've had in the entire country. I live in LA, and can't find pad thai this good. 

5 star thai restaurant"}
{"text":"We were in the area and wanted to try something new so we chose Bahn Thai. It wasn't the best Thai food we've ever had, but it was good! A nice little restaurant in a nice area of the town. We had to get the mango and coconut rice to go because we were all so full after our meal. I think the best thing we had was the money bag dumpling appetizer!"}
{"text":"I ate there with my client today.  Very tasty food.   I go to this restaurant at least twice a month.  Great atmosphere!   Wish you all the staff Happy New year!"}
{"text":"Okay, this place has gone downhill since my last visit. We ordered a thai iced tea and it tasted like southern sweet tea brewed too strong covered in condensed milk: not spiced and refreshing like it should taste... Just bitter and sugary. Then we got the summer rolls, which came with a sweet and sour sauce instead of (the usual and expected) peanut sauce. At this point my teeth were aching from all the sugar but we ordered the Pad Thai anyways. Wow. Just wow. Instead of a fragrant, light, zesty sauce on the noodles, the dish was covered in gobs of frozen-entree-mandarin-chicken sauce. Soooo sweet and sooooooooo badly cooked. The noodles were practically inedible. The only saving grace was the waiter who took the dishes away from us and had the kitchen make us something else. Granted, that \"something else\" was also pretty inedible but we ate as much as we could and got out of there ASAP. Won't be back, not worth the almost $40 tab."}
{"text":"Decided to make a quick last minute lateThai food fix with the (GF) Upon arriving I notice the restaurant was slow and more of a family traditional style place, Kudos to them!  We ordered the beef larb- ok\"flavor they use ground beef and some spices.  The papaya salad was sweet and citrusy definitely  not my style I prefer my papaya salad to have a kick of spice, fish sauce and some bang to it. Had better Thai and Laos food in Los Angeles. Will I return.? Prob not."}
{"text":"I ate there a few days ago during lunch and the food was ok, it was the customer service that sucked. I asked this waiter named Anthony for a simple request and he responded, \"hey you do know I have other customers right?\" I could have fainted!!! I could not believe he said that.... Extremely sub par customer service, will not be returning!!!"}
{"text":"I'm rarely on this side of town but was craving something ethnic and local for lunch. This restaurant did not disappoint! I ordered the Pad Kee Maow and it was delicious. I love wide noodle dishes! I asked for spicy and they did not disappoint. Quick, delicious, and friendly service. Definitely will come back if I'm ever on this side of town again."}
{"text":"Been to this place numerous times and it has been great every time ! Usually go with the Panang curry and veggie tempura sushi ... The best in town slightly beating cow fish . If your a vegetarian they can make any meat dish with tofu , mushroom soup , basil noodles all amazing and full of flavor . Best thai food in Charlotte"}
{"text":"My cousin comes here at least once a week, so he HAD to take me when I was in town. I'm sure glad he did! They have everything: sushi, Thai curry and noodles, and even hibachi. Too hard to choose for the indecisive like me! I finally decided on the massaman curry. Delicious! The portion was big too, definitely enough for two meals.

My cousin ordered the hibachi steak. They even ask if you want to spice up your hibachi. Never heard of that. I'm not a fan of spice at all, but that's cool. I tried a bite, and although too spicy for my taste, the steak was juicy. So good that I wanted to come back the next day to get some (non-spicy)  for myself.

My other cousin and her friend both ordered one roll of sushi each. Usually, one roll isn't enough, and I order two. I was very surprised (and pleased for them) when their rolls came out and it was almost the equivalent of two rolls! Good thing I didn't go for the sushi and order two! Although I didn't get to taste their rolls, they looked just as good.

For dessert was the \"must-have\" sticky rice and mango. I was so full by that time, but couldn't help myself to the fresh mango. Yum!

Coming for a late dinner on a week night, the place was pretty empty. I don't know if that's the reason the service was so great from all the staff, or because they personally know my cousin who is always there. I believe it's the former because they seemed to treat the other customers the same way: friendly, having fun, and very helpful."}
{"text":"This spot should just focus on Thai and remove the sushi. 
The sushi isn't cut properly and they are selling imitation krab as sashimi. 

When we complained they were a bit argumentative and charged us for extra tuna. Sorry but imitation ANYTHING does not qualify as sashimi. 

Soup was OK 
Steak salad was in desperate need of more lettuce and the beef was of poor quality. 

Recommendation - adjust the attitude to service-customer first and focus on making great Thai food with quality ingredients."}
{"text":"The decor is wonderful and the sushi was extremely fresh. 

The only negative thing I have to say is that service was a little slow. My wife and I were the only people in the dining room, but it still took us 30 minutes to get our food. 

Having said that, the food was excellent - so much so that it made up for the slow service."}
{"text":"We ordered the Pudthai with chicken as our protein, mango sticky rice and Thai tea.  The tea was delicious as was the food.  The 2 stars comes because there was at least 1 piece of chicken that was definitely a spoiled piece.  It tasted as bad as bad chicken smells.  I discreetly spit that into the napkin.  The tea, mango with sticky rice, and water was not enough to get the taste out of my mouth.  Only 3 bites into this dish and unable to finish.  Let the server know the situation when she came over. She apologized,  took our plates, and returned with check.  No manager ever came to check on us to follow up.  I know people who go here regularly and love it. I will probably try them again.  I do hope they are more cautious with their raw meat. I would think that that chicken left an odor when it was raw that should have been discovered.  Also, I would suggest follow up with customers who have legitimate complaints.  I usually only give reviews when extremely favorable, I don't bash for poor service or food I don't like.  I just don't respond.  But after 5 days, I am still bothered by the lack of concern on their end and I am grateful I was not affected with food poisoning"}
{"text":"Never have I been to this Thai place in Charlotte. We went on a Friday night around 7:30 and it was packed but we did not have to wait too long for a table. We had a party of 4. We started out with some appetizers, Spring rolls, Beef Sate, and a order of Thai Chicken wings. The Spring rolls were excellent - two to an order. The Sate was beef and such a great grilled flavor. The Thai Chicken wings were crispy but could have had more of a Thai flavor, served with a sweet and sour sauce. Our entrees, which we shared were the Thai Fried Rice with Chicken, a order of Pud Thai, which we call Pad Thai? And a order of Pud ma Maung, which was vegetables and cashews and we had Pork added as our protein. All the dishes were very good. Although I never found a Cashew in the Pud ma Maung. The Fried Rice was especially good, just a perfect Thai flavor. We ordered everything with a heat level of #4 and it was not overly hot.   They staff was very nice and very attentive for a very busy little restaurant! I will be coming back !!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the red curry chicken. It was delish! Next time I will ask them to add a few pineapple pieces. Heat at level 4 was a good but just little hotter than I expected but a sip of water took care of it. The spring roll was good. I also had mango sticky rice : It's not my fave but it was interesting. Prices are a tad high."}
{"text":"Ordered vegetable for soup for lunch and they charged me $17.27. Told me it was extra for vegetables and tofu. Absolutely ridiculous. It's vegetables 3 pieces of tofu and broth."}
{"text":"On me newfound never end quest for awesome thai food, I am happy Bahn Thai opened up and wish them much success.  They have only been open about a month and a half and have all the class of an established restaurant.

Saturday night, I called ahead since I hate waiting.  It was not needed however and we walked into a nicely decorated casual type atmosphere.  A few TV's were strategically stationed throughout which provided a nice outlet for ignoring your dinner companions if you so choose :-).  Sushi bar in the back and booths on each side.

Service was attentive which is very nice especially in Thai restaurants so that they can explain the level of spiciness and the intricacies of the dishes.  Our waiter was friendly and did a great job of recommending dishes to suit our taste.  When one of my co diners chose a level 3 for spiciness, I had to pop in and make them back it down.  First rule of Thai food is you can always add, but you can't take away you know?  

We started with the Fresh Summer Rolls which were mui tasty.  Shrimp, lettuce, carrots, thai basil and rice noodles rolled tightly in rice paper with a well put together plum sauce on the side.  The plum sauce and the plump shrimp are key to making this dish awesome.

Next up, Pud Kee Mow, chicken.  Al Dente wide rice noodles, egg, bamboo shoots, peppers, carrot, mushrooms and thai basil.  This dish was nicely fragrant thanks to the abundant use of the thai basil and blended together nicely in a rice dish that did not disappoint.  Nicely flavorful and piping hot.  I'm glad I chose the level 2 spiciness because my pansy a** couldn't have handled anything hotter.  My only issue is that the chicken was slightly tough which is about standard for these types of restaurants so I'll probably switch proteins the next time I go.

That being said, I think Ballantyne has a big hit on their hands.  Great work Bahn Thai, see you again soon."}
{"text":"I've been a few times now and the Thai is good but definitely will be skipping the sushi!!  I guess it's like going into an Italian restaurant and ordering a hamburger!"}
{"text":"Saw that they had positive reviews on Yelp for papaya salad so we decided to head here for dinner and try it out since I was craving for it.  I'm a huge fan of papaya salad so I was supppperrr excited to devour it! However, it was such a disappointment.  The sauce was too sweet in my taste and wasn't as authentic like most places I've had.  (Pho Hoa and Viet Thai's papaya salad are more of my taste bud) 

We also got the beef larb which wasn't terribly bad. Just ok, nothing really special. The tom yum soup was good, they give you a lot of meats and big jumbo shrimps which I thought was pretty nice. (Considering the price $7 for a bowl is kind of pricey for a small soup bowl) However, they do give you a pretty good amount of foods and service was good. 

Love the decors though. Very clean and was still very new inside.  Had the papaya salad been good, I would have been sold on this place but too bad it didn't."}
{"text":"Great food.  Best sashimi salad I've ever had.  The shrimp spring roll, edamame, and red curry were all very fresh and delicious. Excellent service and the owners are very friendly."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Thai in South Charlotte. WAY better than Bangcock Ocha!! Everything is so good! The chicken satay is the best in pineville! Their quality is outstanding compared to other thai places in the area!"}
{"text":"I'm here at least once a week and they never fail me. Awesome Sushi, Great Thai dishes, and fantastic staff.

The staff are always friendly and the food is quick but delicious.

My favorites: spicy tuna roll, The Thom Kha soup, Teriaki Chicken or beef, and if your not strapped for cash then the Bento Box

EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"We had read all of the good reviews for this place and we finally had a chance to try it. The ONLY reason I am not giving it five stars is because they seemed to be ginger averse in my opinion, which is odd for a Thai restaurant.

We went for lunch and we were happy to see they had a nice crowd. We definitely want this place to do well and stay open. The Thai options in Ballantyne are meager. 

My wife had the Pad See Ew and it was very tasty. I had the panang curry which was also very tasty but had no ginger in it. Ginger would have made that dish really pop. I also got the Tom Ka Gai (chicken coconut soup) which is my measuring stick for any Thai restaurant. If your Tom Ka Gai is good, you have won me over. Theirs was good, but lacked ginger and lemon grass and they put a fist full of whole cilantro on the top. The cilantro really made the soup tasty, but it was gone in the first spoonful.

My advice would be to add ginger and lemongrass to the Tom Ka Gai... and chop the cilantro and onions for the soup (onion pieces were really large). Otherwise the chicken pieces were large and tender... and the overall flavor was above average.

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves Thai or is on the fence about it. The bonus is they also have sushi there, so if you are Thai averse and all of your friends want to go there, you can get sushi and everyone will leave happy!

Edit: we had take out from Bahn Thai for the night before Thanksgiving... these folks are SO NICE... I'd go back there just because they were so friendly and helpful with my large order. Additional dishes you need to try based on our new experience: Pud Prig Paow... REALLY SPICY.. I got it a little extra spicy and wow, was it good! Gaeng Keow Wang if you like a green curry.. my wife loved it."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch while in Charlotte for work.  Great sushi lunch specials.  Soup and two sushi rolls for $9.99 can't go wrong.  There is plenty of counter seating along with tables and booths."}
{"text":"Takeout-their chicken, cabbage and rice noodle soup is really good.  It's one of my go-to places for when I'm not feeling well and need some healthy comfort soup."}
{"text":"I've tried many many Thai restaurants in the area through the years this one is by far the best!!! Authentic and fresh! Great sushi, curry dishes and the Pad Thai is my FAVORITE!"}
{"text":"I am a fanatic for Thai food and this one is definitely on the list!  Being vegetarian makes it hard to eat at most places but this Thai place does accomodate to everyone.  The noodles, rice & stir fry dishes are Delish.  I don't eat sushi but my sister devoured the veg sushi she got because it was that good. They have a good selection of food, drinks & sushi.  Its a place to try if you love Thai food or feeling adventurous."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I'm new to town and I ran across this place while looking for a place to love. Their sushi is outstanding!  I love their lunch special - 2 rolls and a salad for $9.99. I've been back seven or eight times and still have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for Thai food!  We enjoyed their Chicken Satay, Chicken Pad Thai, and Beef Pad See Ew. Oh...and the Basil Fried Rice is what food dreams are made of!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to Charlotte and had lunch at Bahn Thai last week. The food was good, but nothing spectacular. Just OK. It was also way overpriced. It's possible that we just need to get used to the cost of food out here (as opposed to Southern California); but we ordered Pad Thai, Red Curry, Papaya Salad and chicken soup. My husband had iced tea and I had Thai tea. Our bill came out to $66. We'd have Thai food regularly in CA and we'd try different Thai restaurants to change things up, but I don't think we've ever paid that much for Thai food. One thing I thought was interesting was that they also have a sushi bar. I didn't see an itamae there so I don't think we'll be trying their sushi."}
{"text":"This little shopping center that could is in Ballantyne, but I have this tendency to forget about it because it's \"over there\", on the other side of the freeway - not to mention coming off of 485, it can be a real pain to get across all that traffic and get into the correct lane in time to make it over in time. Sometimes you end up turning right, turning around (which itself isn't easy because of lane restrictions) and then coming back at it.

Regardless, Bahn Thai is another nice surprise hidden within, and it is almost overwhelmed by other favorites there, but don't let that fool you. The staff is very friendly and service is prompt. While I haven't been for dinner, the lunch is just about the right size, and prices aren't bad at all for what you get. Definitely a nice change of pace."}
{"text":"The service here has gone down hill. Came here with my husband on a thursday. We got sat right away but no one came to greet us or asked for a drink order for 10 mins! We waited and waited. They weren't even that busy. No one looked rushed or running around. We were about to leave and finally a server came up to us and didn't even greet us. All she said was \"Ready to order??\". I didn't know if she meant for drinks or for food. We gave her our drink order and then our food. Right when we gave her our drink order someone came right after her and asked what we wanted to drink. Super confusing. We got our food at a decent time. I did not like my noodles. They were sticking together and there were way too many vegetables compared to noodles or chicken. My husband wasn't crazy about his food either. Our drinks were filled once and that was it. Their prices are more expensive compared to others. But the thing that would keep me away is the awful service."}
{"text":"We've been enjoying Bahn Thai for almost two years.  Consistently good food and good service.  Can't ask for more than that."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on my lunch break. Quick service and friendly staff. I ordered the  Gaeng Dang - red curry chicken, basil leaves, peas, carrots and bamboo shoots (my new Thai fave everywhere). The curry seasoning seemed to be a bit stronger than the many others I've tried in Charlotte. I personally loved the flavor but can see where others wouldn't. The portion size was just perfect for a lunch trip. Although, the itis--sleep that follows a great and normally large meal--still managed to catch up with me when I returned to work. And despite the fact that my Ballantyne Corporate Place perks card didn't get me anything free other than a few giggles from my waitress, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So far the best (authentic) Thai dishes in NC, from what I've tried so far. Nothing really compares to some home cooked thai by Bennie who happens to have a restaurant in NYC. THAT'S clearly the best and most authentic, but this is REALLY close and great."}
{"text":"Saturday around 5pm not crowded but not empty, service was prompt, food came out quickly. Sushi was a little pricey but all food was great. Enjoyed the Lucky rolls too."}
{"text":"Service was really great and atmosphere was nice. Food was bland. Got the Tom kah soup and it tasted like warm milk with hardly any spice. Would consider giving the restaurant another try since other reviews were good, but probably will try a few other Thai places in the area before going back. Disappointed :("}
{"text":"I love their papaya salad. I'm laos so I order it \"laos style\" so good and spicy! I also love everything else they have to offer. Only downside is some of the stuff is more pricy than other Thai places I've been too but it's to be expected since it's in Ballenyte."}
{"text":"Okay! I Love, Love, Love this place! It was my first Thai experience and I give it a Double A+!!! I had the Pud Met Ma Muang with Scallops and Brown Rice (Stir fried with roasted cashew nuts, bell peppers, celery, carrots, onions, and scallions in chili sauce) I can't describe how great this dish was... I didn't get the ladies name who was our waitress, but she was so nice and very friendly! Since it was my first Thai, I had some questions and she was patient in explaining and helping me to decide what to try... it was very flavorful and just a little spicy, but not hot at all... Suzanne had the Charlotte Roll and her Mother had the Shrimp Teriyaki... Let me say, there was not one morsel left on anyones plate! We will probably go back this week! I recommend trying it at your earliest opportunity!"}
{"text":"First and last time. I like to tryout new Thai places now that I moved to south Charlotte and my favorite Thai places are no longer conveniently close to my house. I got carry out Pad See Ew after my kickball game today. I had my mouth set for that delicious Pad See Ew flavor. This dish tasted like nothing. COMPLETELY FLAVORLESS! I had to add salt and pepper to bring out some flavor. The rice noodles were mushy (wayyyyy over cooked) and there was barely any meat. Who knew Thai could be flavorless? The place was nice and clean and the staff was attentively, but that's not enough to bring me back. #ontothenextone"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!!! Been here over a dozen times. I've tried a few dishes but I keep going back for the curries. I have NEVER been disappointed once eating here. The staff is great, the service is quick and you will leave stuffed. Love!!!"}
{"text":"This is my goto spot for Thai food in Charlotte.  Fresh food and great team.  I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. The pud gra pow was very authentic and delicious. The portions are a good size for lunch and it came with a choice of salad or soup and a spring roll.Excellent Thai food."}
{"text":"Reliable, not over crowded and service is impeccable. The sushi is a little heavy on the rice, but it came out fast and fresh. I highly recommend getting one of their sake beverages. Kids all seem to like the fried rice/tempura choices and they make a mean Shirley temple!"}
{"text":"Great selection and service. We were sat quickly and staff helped me stash my husbands crutches while we ate. Everything was delicious, although I was disappointed to bite into cilantro in my crab dish as it wasn't listed on the menu and I can't stand the taste. Will be back to try more dishes next time a Thai craving strikes."}
{"text":"Where to start-I guess with my repeat order of the Thom Ka soup and the chicken wings-the chicken soup is made with coconut milk, lemon grass and cilantro and is topped with a spicy red oil that really opened my sinuses. The chicken wings are crisp and served with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. 

They always have special sushi offerings that are fresh and are served beautifully on long white platters. We also have had sashimi and it has also been fresh and beautifully sliced. 

Casual dress, private parking lot, give this one a try when you are in the Ballantyne area."}
{"text":"An overall decent experience here.  I always get the pad kee mao...and forget that they do not ever give enough noodles.  I need to ask for extra next time.  The favor is good, spice level 4, although next time I will try 5.  They serve a little tray with 5 different sauces, which I hadn't experienced before. Very delicious! Try the green one..yum! Very spicy though.  I had mango sticky rice for dessert..they used a green tea rice?! Why? I don't know because it was honestly disgusting.  Yuck! Days later I can still taste the grossness.  Please use white rice!

The service was good. Good sweet tea. Friendly and fast waitress.  The food come out very quickly which is great! The sushi was pretty good too."}
{"text":"My favorite dishes are the stir fry clam, stir fry lobster, stir fry beef with oyster sauce! Bahn Thai roll is yummy to!"}
{"text":"I've worked in Ballantyne for a few years and never knew this place existed, but am glad I found it now! Went in for lunch and the place was packed, seeming to be a hot spot for business lunches. 

The server was very quick to take my order and brought me a delightful cup of their \"house soup\". I don't know what it was exactly, but it seemed like a spin on a chicken and rice. It was a tasty start to he meal. As for lunch, I went with the 2 sushi rolls and that did not disappoint. The sushi was very fresh and made to order. Each lunch dish also comes with a spring roll and it was just the right amount of crispyness to go with the light lunch. 

This is definitely a place that I will be returning to for many lunches in the future."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch.  The waitress obviously did not know the menu.  The dish she explained was not what I received.  A runner brought the food out and when the waitress came by soon after.  You could see the \" I got that wrong\" expression on her face.  She immediately started asking if she could get me something else.  The food was ok, the portion was tiny and it was way over priced.  Starting with better service, this could be a good place."}
{"text":"Bahn Thai serves the best Thai food in Charlotte. We have been to this restaurant several times and the food is very consistent and always delicious. The service is excellent. The Panang Curry and Pud Gra Pow dishes are my favorite. I also like the Pud Thai and Green Curry dishes. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Thai food and super friendly staff! Casual place, come as you are. My favorite Thai spot in town. I've been there at least 20 times and never disliked anything I've ordered."}
{"text":"Authentic, filling, best all around place that I have been to in the Charlotte area when it comes to Thai food. You will be glad you stopped in and your stomach will thank you as well. If you want a different experience, sit at the bar and watch them make the sushi rolls. Such an art to the preparation and it comes out so nice. Enjoy it"}
{"text":"Very rude staff, very poor service. 

I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! If I could give this place a -5, I would! I walk in at 9pm to a server shouting across the restaurant, are you ordering to-go (Not hello, welcome, HI)! I replied, yes, I guess. He replied, \"We close at 9:15\", I said \"Oh, your sign says 9:30 as I take a seat\", Server \"Yea, but we close at 9:15, so we can go home at 9:30\", Me \"Oh, I work in the industry and I never heard of a business doing that\", Some guy sitting at the bar (appeared to be a manager) interrupts conversation and states \"If you don't like our policy you can leave\". ME \"Ok\". Walked out, now wonder why the place was empty. As, I walked out I noticed how dirty and un-kept the restaurant was and I thought it was a sign that maybe I should not have eaten there. If a business wants to close at 9:15, then put 9:15 on the door. Granted I was close to closing, but 30 minutes away for someone who was just ordering a single take-out dish did not warrant this treatment. Ended up going across the street to Midwood, having a great dinner and leaving $20 tip ($19 check) to a great service experience!"}
{"text":"What thai is it? It's THAI TIME!!! Thai food is amongst my favorites of cuisines. A bite of any of the dish at Banh Thai will have you tasting the exoticness of Thailand right here in North Carolina. How much better can it get?! Our waitress was very friendly, and the service was great. The only thing I would change is the lack of variety on the menu. There aren't a whole lot of options when it comes to the curry dishes. They are each delicious nonetheless! :)"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and were pleasantly surprised that we had a choice of tables on a Labor Day Saturday night at 6pm. Very clean and quiet atmosphere.  Our waitress was attentive regarding dietary issues for two in our party. That worked out well. 

The appetizers of fried calamari and tempura shrimp were excellent although for four guests there could have been more of each. The crispy duck was excellent per two guests. I had the pineapple fried rice with shrimp. Excellent, not greasy and an abundant serving.  My wife had the Pud Thai with chicken
with no complaints. 

I had forgotten to look for the beautiful lobster roll with sushi & tempura pictured here elsewhere. I'll have that next time.  

All in all a good visit with more to come."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband and have found my new favorite Thai restaurant. After moving to Charlotte from Atlanta, I've been on the hunt for a good Thai place. One that is tasty and authentic and makes your mouth water each time you think of it. I'd read the reviews on Yelp, and was a little skeptical, but they definitely lived up to the words people were saying. I can't remember exactly what we had, but I can say everything is good. Next time I visit, I will write another review and give the names of the dishes. I'm sure that will be helpful to first time visitors! Enjoy this place :-)"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch while in south Charlotte for work. Nothing spectacular, but was a good choice for something different for lunch with coworkers. Tried the Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Had Thom Kha shrimp soup - as good as I've had anywhere, and the shrimp was so tender, not overcooked and rubbery like most places.  The Gaeng Panang curry was equally great.  Very clean, great vibe, great service.  Can't find a single negative about tonight's visit!"}
{"text":"The true test of a Thai restaurant for me is their Pad See Ew. Why? Because, if it's good, I will order it each time I return. If it's not good, I won't go back. Well, unless their sticky rice is to die for!

This place failed in their sticky rice, but, the Pad See Ew was spot on. Perfectly chewy noodles with a liberal dose of egg doused in a slurpy sauce makes this my new go to Thai place. Glad we moved so close to this gem. 

Some of their seafood specials looked worth deviating from the pad see ew. Some day."}
{"text":"Visiting from LA. You wouldn't think they would have amazing sushi in North Carolina but man the food was so amazing. Really top quality meat. Server was really nice. And the saki was amazing. Next time we're here we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Solid Thai food place. Staff is friendly. Food is scrumptious! Prices are alright. Best deal is the lunch special which I highly recommend (Starting at $9). You get your order, rice (brown or jasmine) and a spring roll. Soups are on point!

I got the Gaeng Keow Wan, which is green curry in coconut milk with peas, carrots, and eggplant. I thought the eggplant was mistakenly beef and I didn't eat it. I had extra vegetables and tofu as my protein. The dish was very flavorful. I would like to try the Gaeng Karee next.

I also had the Thom Kha soup, coconut milk with onions, scallions, mushrooms, herbs and dried chili.. And I got mine with extra vegetables- broccoli, carrots, bamboo shoots, etc. The soup is $5. I always get Thom Kha soup or a variation of it to compare with other Thai restaurants.

This restaurant stacks up very well. With that being said, price is higher end but definitely worth it. Great quality, friendly staff, great ambience and decor. 

Would I return? Yes."}
{"text":"I mostly come here for the sushi. Spicy tuna roll and crunchy shrimp roll are my favorite. Aside from the sushi, Pud Thai is also very good. I've never dined in, but the sushi counter is a great place to hang out and nibble if you're alone (I enjoyed chatting while I waited for my sushi.) LOVE that the sushi chef is a lady, too--very rare!"}
{"text":"BF was craving Thai food, amazing how many Thai places closed on Mondays. Based on Yelp reviews we decided to check out Bahn Thai.. it did not disappoint. We started with the spring rolls, they were crispy, fresh and served with a nice dipping sauce, order came with 4, we could have easily eaten 8 especially since I only had the opportunity to eat 1 and a half!. For dinner I ordered Pud Kee Mow level 3 spicy with chicken. Noodles were perfectly cooked, generous amount of chicken and fresh veggies and not overly loaded with sauce. I like things spicy and the level 3 gave a good kick. BF ordered Ped Met Ma Muang level 5 spicy with beef... also excellent, as with my dish generous amounts of beef, fresh veggies and not overly loaded with sauce. We didnt notice much different between the level 3 and level 5 spicy so the BF would have liked it hotter. We both ended up with leftovers to take home and mine was even better the next day... the thai basil flavor really shone thru on the leftovers. I have already told two friends about this place and look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Always have great food and experience here. Been there few times for lunch and dinner. Their tempuras are awesome - crispy without being greasy.  The basil fried rice is near perfect and flavorful.  Service is always good.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I was in town from Maryland over the Christmas break and was craving Thai food. I read reviews for a bunch of places and talked my inlaws into trying this place. I was a little nervous it wouldn't meet my expectations, but it exceeded them. Everything was good, from the spring rolls to the pad Thai to the red curry (which was my favorite). My husband and inlaws loved it as well. The waitress helped with recommendations and provided a spice tray so we could experiment which I loved. It will definitely become a tradition when we are in town!"}
{"text":"I grabbed take-out here a couple days ago, 3 dishes - vegetable red curry (11.95), tofu pad thai (10.95), and tofu pad kee mow (10.95).  I asked them to have it ready for pickup at 6:20.  They were very friendly and spoke clear English on the phone (a nice plus) and my food was ready as soon as I got there!  The food was very good, no complaints.  I feel for the price point that the food is at, it is a 4 star restaurant.  I will definitely return to try more dishes."}
{"text":"So I left a review a long time ago for take out and I can't believe I haven't updated it. Bahn Thai is still just as amazing! It ended up turning a once week spot for lunch every week for almost a year! Pineapple fried rice is amazing! Gaeng Mussamun is also amazing. Almost everything on that lunch menu is amazing. Even their Japanese food options and sushi is great! Ask for Mary! She's great!!"}
{"text":"I love me some Thai food and I mean LOVE!  I've been to Bahn Thai to eat in and for take out.  The service while dining in was excellent. The food was good as well. I had chicken cashew and it had great flavor. Thai tea was also good. Then we decided to try mango and sweet , sticky rice. My first time trying this and it was great!  Who would think something so simple would be so tasty. I've also had Pad Thai here and it was good as well. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the wait for take out was pretty long. They told us about 15-20 minutes. It was more like 30-45. Definitely could've been worse but it was around 1 on a weekday and not very busy. Still food is great and the staff has always been very friendly."}
{"text":"I love Banh Thai's food so it hurts me to only give them 3 stars.  The food is always 100% but the staff could be a little more attentive.  Also, I've watched parties wait 5+ minutes to be sat, while staff walks right by them.  That's only happened to me once and I almost walked out... just not sure why that happens at all."}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai I've ever had, also their eel rolls is amazing I believe is called the Rock and Roll Eel!  But you MUST, MUST try their pad thai the noodles are thinner than your traditional places but their spice and blend of flavors will simply leave you addicted."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I suggest the Ballantyne sushi roll. But everything is great, and the place is clean and a bit small but it doesn't get too crowded to feel comfortable."}
{"text":"Great Thai Food. Pud Thai they call it here, not Pad Thai. I love it!"}
{"text":"Their Pud Thai is ridiculously good. Just went for the first time tonight, and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing friendly atmosphere and excellent service! I ordered chicken vegetable soup and loved it, vegetables were  prepared just right lightly cooked fresh and crispy. We also ordered pad sew ew with chicken. Dish was very tender, light and flavorful sauce, crisply vegetates. Definitely a place to go back to!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious Thai is happening down in Ballantyne! We stopped in after a crazy day around town, ravenous and hopeful.

We ordered some bottled beers and set to work on the menu. We ordered noodle dishes and were both pleased with our choices. My Pud Kee Mow was smoky and spicy (but not too spicy). The Mr's Pud See Ew was equally well-executed and satisfying.

Our server was delightful and talked us into the mango and sticky rice dessert. Simple, not overtly sweet, and the perfect finale to a fantastic dinner experience.

I'd recommend checking out Bahn Thai on a date night before catching a movie at the Ballantyne Village Theatre, or after a pre-dinner glass of wine at Cr√º Wine Shop close by."}
{"text":"Went with the traditional Thai and saw some recommendations for the Pud See-Ew and went vegetables and hold the egg.  Pretending a nearly maybe vegan dish. ;-)    Dish came out hot and well seasoned at a 2 out of 5 spicey was perfect for me.  Very flavoraful, crisp cooked vegetables and rice noodles not \"starchy\" and gooey, but we'll cooked but firm.  Good job."}
{"text":"Great find!  This place is small but they turn tables well.  The food portions were huge.  We all had leftovers.  We tried to pud Thai and fried rice.  Everything had a nice flavor.   The wings were perfect and crispy.  You can ask for your level of hot for certain dishes.  Will be back and looking forward to trying other dishes."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!   Discovered Bahn Thai on yelp and decided to give it a shot.  Best dinner decision we've ever made!  Everything we have tried has been great!  My wife and I came a few times and finally invited my mom and sister and they love it as much as we do.  It is all of our favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Bahn Thai is one of our favorite places to eat in Charlotte. The service is wonderful, the prices are just right and portions perfect. Most importantly, the food is amazing. We drive all the way from Huntersville to dine at this gem."}
{"text":"Was here visiting family for the weekend. My brother suggested we go here for lunch. I ordered the panang curry. It was great! Very filling. The portion size was large. The service was also good. Would definitely come back here when I'm visiting again."}
{"text":"I'm not that adventurous when it comes to Thai food and so everytime I come here i've pretty much gotten the same thing. Which was the 1st dish I tried and liked. I always get the seafood combination as my protein. The food is so fresh!! I decided to venture out recently and tried the Summer Rolls and Thai Tea... not a fan. The summer rolls were dry and boring and the Thai Tea was just weird. So i'll stick to my old faithful from now on which I never have any complaints about."}
{"text":"I've been seeing Julia M check into this place for a while and already heard some good things about the place so I put it on my list of places to check out.

I stopped in for lunch one day.  While it was a pain to get to because of 485 construction, thankfully 485 will hopefully not be under destruction for too much longer and getting here will be a bit easier.

When I arrived, service was a bit slow.  There were 3 servers and a sushi chef behind the bar.  I waited about 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged me to seat me.  Once seated service improved a bit.

Compared to other Thai places that might have 5-8 lunch specials, this place has a bigger lunch menu.  You can order your meal with various types of meats or no meat at all.  You can also opt for brown rice instead of white.  Lunches come with soup or salad and a spring roll.

I went with soup and my standard meal for trying out a new Thai place, Pud Gra Pow which is choice of protein with Thai basil, peppers, carrots in a light sauce.  I also ordered it level 5 on the spice meter.  

The soup was kind of meh.  It consisted of chicken with julienne strips of veggies.  The chicken flavor was overpowering.   The spring roll was chewy instead of crispy and lacked real flavor.   The meal was nicely presented and it tasted wonderful.  The spice level was about a 4 rather than 5 but still decent.

For my first visit I think there were too many flaws to consider this more than 3 star review.  But I will definitely add this to my list of Thai places to return to."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai restaurant!   The red curry chicken was one of the best I've ever had. The restaurant is very clean with a nice atmosphere.  The service was very pleasant. I am thrilled that we  have a Thai restaurant in the Ballantyne area. If you like Thai, this is a great restaurant to go to. Eat in, or takeout!"}
{"text":"Been going to Bahn Thai for 4 years and I love it! Very rarely can I find Thai food around the country that compares to Bahn Thai. Sushi, curry, and pad Thai dishes are all delicious. Service is always consistent fast and friendly."}
