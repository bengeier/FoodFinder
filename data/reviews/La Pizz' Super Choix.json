{"text":"I just ordered 2x chicken pita sandwiches and for the first time in eating this dish I regret ordering from La Pizz!  Ive never had problems with this establishment but this is just over the top!!  Solid dried out chicken which was probably way past the eat before date, tons of oignons but exaggerated... probably to hide the chickens taste, way too much sauce and the salad was brown borderline rotting!  Disappointed to the last time i ever order or show up to this place!!  I think they just didn't care enough to put fresh ingredients...   never again!!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, but hits the spot just right. Something about the sauce."}
{"text":"The best pizza in town, period. Don't go looming elsewhere, you won't find a better place. The sauce is awesome, the crust just right. I'd recommend it any day."}
{"text":"This restaurant makes heavenly pizzas!!! The crust is not too hard and not too soft, just right! I had mine delivered home, and there is an advantage to that and it's the 2 for 1 pizzas! Buy one get the cheapest one free (also applicable for take-outs)! I had the \"P'tite\" sea food pizza and the Du Chef pizza. Both are uuuugh too good. As the name of the restaurant says, it is a \"Super Choix\"!!!! I have nothing to add. This is the best pizza place in Saint-Basile-Le-Grand!!!!!"}
