{"text":"Visiting this restaurant was very depressing to me, since i had been a regular of Sweet Tomatoes. As a vegetarian it was fantastic.  The new concept, not so much. I'm not really sure what they were thinking?    From the start, the \"smartcard\" idea is stupid. You definitely feel like they are grabbing money from you on every turn, and you can't tell what your final bill is until you leave. Then to top off the insult, they add on a 7.5% gratuity.  When I have to go around to serve myself. I'd much rather have a waiter and give them 15%.  I read that this is a 4 month experiment. I have no doubt it will be a failed experiment because I certainly won't be back. If you can't make enough money with your Sweet Tomatoes just raise your prices. This way you are loosing all your customers, and when you finally realize that and turn it back into Sweet Tomatoes will your old customers come back? Some won't.   If your going to change your concept, I definitely recommend you do some better research first. If you did do research and they recommended THIS, I'd get a new research firm."}
{"text":"WARNING! This is not a SWEET TOMATOES. This new concept is like coke creating NEW Coke back in the 80's. Whatever it was that you liked about the original sweet tomatoes is gone. No all you can eat, no serve yourself. This is a fancified version of a 1 trip salad bar. I was a very frequent Sweet Tomatoes patron, but I highly doubt I will be back. First off you have to carry a card which for every item you buy is then swiped. I don't like being nickled and dimed. 1 bowl of soup - that's it for you. Did you like the foccia pizza - so did my kids - GONE. Like the baked potatoes - GONE. How about the Wonton Chicken Salad - GONE. Did you like the ice cream toppings - GONE. How about the muffins - GONE. I guess our favorite family eatery is GONE too. My biggest complaint is that this new sweet tomatoes isn't kid friendly - maybe that was the plan. If you kids aren't lettuce eaters - go somewhere else. FYI Gilbert is scheduled to be remodeled next so visit your real sweet tomatoes there before its gone. :( One last note - even if I had never been to a sweet tomatoes before - I would have been disappointed. The whole \"Card\" system reminds me of my college cafeteria."}
{"text":"Well, this one took me by surprise.  Been a long time visitor to this as Sweet Tomatoes.  I must not be very observant, because I had not realized this had converted over to a Field Kitchen.  Anyways, showed up with my daughter (12 yrs old) tonight.  Walked in and was a little bit confused.  The hostess at the front walked us through, gave a great explanation of how things worked, escorted us to our table, gave us a menu, and we were on our way.  The build your own salad bar is now one-time thru only (which is what we did, everything else looked way too expensive when you add it all up).  Everything is now priced separately... cafeteria-style... and it's pay per item, except for fountain drinks and their small selection of house breads.  The atmosphere is trendy and the staff was decent, but the prices are very high.  If you are not careful you will walk out of there paying quite a bit more than expected.  Also - be aware they add 7.5% gratuity onto your bill unless you specifically request they not do so.  All in all, the food was alright, but the experience is not worth the price.  We will not be returning to Field Kitchen again.  So disappointed... and we are huge fans of Sweet Tomatoes.  Goodbye - you will be missed."}
{"text":"Sweet tomatoes changed to Field Kitchen, seems more like an effort to boost the bottom line.  We would've preferred they raise the prices and kept it the way it was.  It used to be our relaxed unpretentious place for an easy dinner, now the food is overblown, the portions are over sized and the atmosphere is no longer what it was.  We'll keep going for now but we're in the market for our new weekly hang out if anybody has any ideas, please share!"}
{"text":"Total bummer.  Who turns a buffet into a cafeteria?  Walked in, took the tour, and walked out.  Once they hand you a \"Field Kitchen\" debit card to use on your culinary tour around bland land, you walk the bleep out of that place.  Soup Plantation you have made a very big mistake with this endeavor.  I hope the brain trust you paid to invent this frankenstein invested that money in something other than Sweet Tomatoes Field Kitchen, kind of like a boxer throwing a fight."}
{"text":"I wandered into Sweet Tomatoes...err, Sweet Tomatoes Field Kitchen on a whim out to dinner with my family, and what a surprise! The interior has been renovated to give it a fresh, lively and welcoming feel along with a crop of super-friendly staff who were there to explain the change and walk us through the new concept.  I ordered the Japanese Steakhouse Wedge (to fulfill my craving for ST's Oriental Chicken Salad that I love so much) and it was better than anything I had ever eaten at the old Sweet Tomatoes. Extremely fresh with perfectly-cooked beef and a delectable dressing that I've been thinking of ever since..  The rest of my party tried the rotisserie beef brisket, pork ribs and the Baja Shrimp salad, all of which were enjoyed all around. I snuck a bite of the Mac n Cheese with bacon and caramelized onions -- that and my salad were worth a trip back, for sure!  It's a bit more pricey than the OG Sweet Tomatoes, but worth it. I wasn't a big frequenter of the original concept but can definitely see myself visiting the new ST/FK every few weeks. Looking forward to trying some of the other menu items!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is now Sweet Tomatoes Field Kitchen. It's a whole new concept, so don't expect your usual buffet. You receive cards at the door which you have to get swiped every time you put something new on your tray, and then take your card to the cashier to pay when you leave. Don't lose this card, because as in the photo, it's a $50 fine (which is crazy!). Anyone over 4 yrs old must have a card (it's their rule), so make sure your kids don't lose them! They also automatically charge a 7.50% service gratuity charge to your bill unless you request otherwise.  I had the \"make your own salad bar\" deal. It's $1 cheaper than it used to be, but you can't return for more. They have a couple new items in it, like pineapple. Also, they pour dressing on your salad, you can't do it yourself. Everything tastes the same too, no change in that.  They seem to have a lot more choices, along with their old items, and now serve alcohol. The catch is you have to pay extra for everything, and there are no seconds."}
{"text":"I personally like this much better than the original sweet tomatoes concept but I may be a little different than the normal consumer. It is a little bit more expensive but the quality of the food and the service is much better (and the clientele). I prefer to be able to taste food ala carte that is a little higher quality and not fight the all you can eat crowds. I am definitely going back soon since I'm not sure how long it will last."}
{"text":"I've read a lot of the negative reviews and it looks like it really comes down to whether you were a fan of the original all-you-can-eat format.  I'm a big fan of the Field Kitchen concept.  I'll admit, the format is likely to be confusing for a first-time customer, but the hosts will walk you through the changes.  Once you're familiar with the format, the many choices are a major plus.  The food is definitely an upgrade, although if you were a fan of the do-it-yourself salad and soup format, that option is still available and you can end up paying LESS than under the old format.  I really like that if I only want a bowl of soup and bread, I only have to pay for what I order and I don't feel like I need to eat more than I really want just because it's available.  At the same time, if I'm in the mood for something more substantial, like dinner of pork ribs or turkey, or a gourmet salad I can do that too.  The service is also a big upgrade over the original Sweet Tomatoes, not to mention a different class of customer from the old crowd that used stand around the soup in order to pick out the meatballs or chicken out of the soups to put on their salad so they don't have to pay any extra for the grilled chicken they had available in the salad bar.  For me, that's one of the biggest and best changes resulting from this switch in format.  There are bugs to work out, but they've improved in the handful of times I've visited.  That's what it boils down to -- if your heart is set on a buffet, you won't be happy, so go somewhere else.  If you're more concerned about good food, you'll be pleased with Field Kitchen."}
{"text":"I am new to the Sweet Tomatoes experience, but I have to say that I'm enjoying the change to the Field Kitchen environment. Having an option that's so affordable and close to my office is excellent. Being greeted by a living herb garden is a great touch and it makes the health food geek inside me smile. I also really like the addition of carving meats and rotisserie.  Overall, I'm excited for the new change and am eager to see if Sweet Tomatoes takes this concept to a national level! I can't wait to see what they do next!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I miss the old Sweet Tomatoes...  It is no longer a buffet but you can still make your own salad if you wish. We opted to order one off the board and it was good but I wouldn't say fantastic. Looks like we should of made our own. We also order the chicken with Irish mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. While everything did taste good it was not the healthy meal we were looking for. The chicken was SUPER greasy and it was rotisserie. I think they ladle butter or drippings on it before serving. The mac and cheese said that is had bacon in it but the bacon was over kill.  All you could taste was the bacon, which sounds good in theory but nope. It was my least favorite. The potatoes were good but you could taste the fat in it. We also got the \"infused\" lemonade which is infused. I watched her pour some sort of berry concentrate into lemonade and shake it.   The ambiance it ok. The employees are nice but the whole set up can be confusing. You have to got to each individual station to get order something. Why go there when you can just go to a regular restaurant and a server can do the running around for you?  Also, today I wrote a comment on their Facebook wall.. no response but I did notice they got write of my post right away. Seems like they don't want feedback."}
{"text":"Where oh where has the old Sweet Tomatoes gone? I see one positive review out of 12 below. That has to tell you something. I'm OK with change so don't get me wrong. But in the restaurant industry, change should be driven by your customer input and by competition. I can't imagine customers asking for this and certainly competition didn't drive this change since the old concept had the place packed all the time!  The clock is ticking Sweet......er......Field Kitchen?? We went this evening and it was a ghost town. I've never seen this restaurant so slow. The food wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either. If I want ribs, sorry, but I'm going somewhere that specializes in ribs like Dave's, Texas Roadhouse, or Dillons. The chicken reminded us of Boston Market, nothing special. And forget about the Alfredo and noodles. Stick with Cucina or even Olive Garden for that.   It's a shame, we used to hit Sweet Tomatoes at least once a month and happily paid our $50-$60 for a family of 4. Sadly this was our last trip there. Let's be honest, the food wasn't exactly out of this world before this new concept, except for the cobbler of course, but the experience was. And that's been taken away. It's just another subpar restaurant now and I'm afraid it won't be long before the doors shut unless some of the old concept and food is brought back.   As for kids? Don't bother bringing them. Especially if they really liked the old concept. It's a real bummer for them. Our kids loved being able to get up and get what they wanted when they wanted it. That was the draw here for them (and of course the original Mac & cheese, focaccia bread, and chocolate lava cake). All of it gone.   The only update/change this restaurant needed was maybe some new carpet and tables. Not an entire concept change.  All I can say is good luck."}
{"text":"OK. So I didn't bother eating there. I can not give the food a review.  I was seated  and they explained how everything worked... I had 3 kids with me and their choice was mac and cheese or chicken soup.... I thought this place was a buffet style?  The cards... everyone over 4 years old has to get one... that is company policy.... and if your kid looses one we have to charge you 50$  It didn't take long and we left.  The people parked next to us had the same experience... I don't see this place lasting long at all... We found another place that was similar and the food was good...The cool thing...  we didn't have to pay for 3.49 for each cup of soup and the kids had some variety...  I might try it again (not bring kids) and  give their food a chance but I have a feeling they will be closed by then..."}
{"text":"I'm reposting this from my last review, however I'm adding a star because I've returned and all their minor tweaks have been flattened out.   Also -- I heard they'll be serving local brews soon, huge plus!!  Was accidentally dragged into going here after my aunt became \"gluten intolerant\" and we were searching for lunch in the area.  Not that I am saying I'm too good for Sweet Tomatoes, but I was taken aback by all their new changes! Sweet Tomatoes Field Kitchen has evolved into a kick ass concept. Goodbye dusty old salad bar! They have rotisserie meats, bomb mac n cheese and daringly good brussels sprouts.  They've revamped the interior with a cute, farm meets the modern world take and I am liking it! Le Creuset pots? Adorable!  The card at the door is a little funky, but it makes it feel less like a buffet to me. Overall was a great experience, wasn't a fan before, but I'm diggin' the new change!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this, I really did. I am an extreme Sweet Tomatoes regular. Although the food is acceptable, this concept is overly complicated to the extent that it ruins the experience.   For everything I could find that I liked, there were two things I didn't like. I went in looking for a salad bar. Well, it turns out they have one. The problem with their salad bar is that it's not really a salad bar. It's an extension of their \"pre-built\" salads concept. The concept being, that if you don't like the pre-built salads they offer, you can pre-build your own.  So this isn't a salad bar so much as it is a \"choose your own pre-built salad-bar-style-adventure,\" at the end of which you are expected, naturally, to want your salad tossed with some dressing and garnished with an expensive protein. If, like me, you wanted a damn salad bar, you throw a serious monkey wrench into the proceedings, as you force the people in chef uniforms behind the \"salad bar\" to contemplate how they are going to deliver their dressing to you if you don't want it tossed with your gourmet salad that you pre-built yourself at the adventure bar. They do have small plastic cups which they will stingily put two tablespoons of dressing in for you. When you ask for another they will also give that to you, even as they look at you as if you just grew another head right before their very eyes.  Well, how bad can it be, I wonder. It wasn't bad. The bowl is generous and the soup is as it used to be. But they don't have the Greek dressing I like and they aren't even prepared to give you an \"I'm so sorry, we don't carry that anymore\" about it. No, nothing but blank stares. Greek dressing? What on _Earth_ is that? No feta either. So a Greek salad style salad that I used to pre-build for myself when this place was a salad bar for working-class schlubs rather than an orgasmic gourmet supersalad experience (now with MEAT BAR)... is not even an option in this grand new adventure. If it was, I might honestly have gone for some overpriced charbroiled chicken to throw on it.  They have a bunch of other stuff too. And they give you a little credit card when you come in, and you go from station to station, deciding what to put on your card. I don't know if the hope is that (as with using a credit card in real life) you won't pay attention to how much money you're spending, but I didn't go to any of the other stations. Oh and if you lose your card, get ready to drop fifty bucks... LOL! Genius! They've managed to find a way to make eating at a restaurant more like parking at the airport! Who could have imagined?  It appears that they also add a gratuity. Look, I'm a good tipper but I don't usually tip at any place where I serve myself and if I do, it ain't 15%. Sweet Tomatoes, are you on crack? I'd love to hear from the employees about how their salaries went up now that this \"gratuity\" is being charged, too. I'm sure that's how it goes and it's not just a naked way to suck 15% more off of your customers. Right? I'm so sure.  Sweet Tomatoes, you had a brand. A good brand. Your brand is so good I will continue to go to it elsewhere. But when I come to your stupid restaurants, I want a salad. I don't want an experience, I don't want giant honking meat carvings, I don't want to have to think so freaking hard and I don't want to pay more than 8 bucks. Unfortunately, it seems that my desires and theirs are almost 100% exclusively mutually at odds. I won't be back."}
{"text":"OMG...went to Sweet Tomatoes last night, and I mentally prepared myself for the usual. I didn't realize it is called Field Kitchen now, and it's a little weird how much they changed. I was pretty hesitant, but I am a sucker for good brussel sprouts. I think I will bump up my once a year visit to at least once a month. Happy to welcome it to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This place is a JOKE! Go over west of it, on the north side to SOUPERSALAD. Hurry up and go out of business , so we can try whatever replaces you. People walking out by the GROVES!"}
{"text":"Would have given it one star, but the food quality was solid.  The whole thing comes down to the stupid card concept and the over complicating of meal ordering.  We go to Sweet Tomatoes/Souplantation/Souper Salad/Fresh Choice BECAUSE IT'S A BUFFET!!!!!  The idea that I need some carry a card around to track what I eat is ludicrous!  Talk about over complicating things.  Ordered the build your own salad and barely filled the bowl.  Of course, only having like 6 leaves of romaine lettuce to get while there was a bucket of spinach didn't help the cause at all, but I digress.  That was one card swipe and it covered the salad, soup, desert and bread.  If I would have wanted to throw in a slice of pizza (which isn't there any more) that's another swipe; visit the rotisserie = another swipe.  Go to the drink island (WTF!) that was another swipe.  Point being is that if you're running a restaurant of any kind and can't track what's on a tray, then it's likely too complicated.  Just the idea of not being to go to a soda fountain and not have glasses waiting is mind boggling.  That said, the food was good, environment was nice, but way too uppity for what it is....A BUFFET!!!!  Whoever the MBA that came up with this idea should be flogged and just reset it to what was.  The price is certainly cheaper and while it's a one trip salad bar, you can load that mofo up and take home the extra.  But still...who wants to do that at....A BUFFET!  Oh...and another thing...why church up all the salad dressings?  Is it too hard to just have Italian?  Yep.  Gotta have \"basalmic vinagrette,\" because Italian is too peasant-like or something.  I suspect this place will be closed within 6 months.  Sad because we actually liked Sweet Tomatoes."}
{"text":"This one isn't closed anymore. They closed it temporarily to get rid of the Field Kitchen thing. It's been back open for a couple months now. Field Kitchen is gone! :) I saw they kept a couple things, like if you want to add chicken to your salad for a little extra cost. And i believe they kept the selling alcohol too. Doesnt seem to go with the kind of food you eat there but hey to each their own. Would be better if they had at least two soda stations instead of the one. You wait awhile when a few people are up at the same time. It's a pretty cool touch screen kind of thing though. Overall i'm glad it's back to just regular Sweet Tomatoes."}
{"text":"So I've always stopped in to Sweet Tomatoes from time to time during lunch for a quick and healthy build-my-own take out salad -- the all-you-can-eat lunch has never really appealed to me. When I stopped into the Tempe location last week, I walked into an all new experience - Sweet Tomatoes is now Field Kitchen.  It was a little overwhelming at first to get used to the new set up - no more football-field size salad bar - I now have more options for salads that the staff makes and tosses right in front of me.  But the best thing - I can still build my own salad if I choose.  WAY more options for salads, so I chose to wander off my usual beaten path and ordered a Caesar with fresh shredded rotisserie chicken.  My chicken Caesar wasn't quite what I expected - the dressing was a little more oil based than what I'm used to - but very tasty nonetheless - a unique take on Caesar!  I walked around the restaurant at the encouragement of one of the staff members to check out the additional offerings.  The rotisserie meats look and smell amazing, as did a dish of mac and cheese walking by me on a tray (which appeared to be cookie sheets cleverly turned into individual serving trays).  The menu of desserts was also diverse and appealing - individual cheesecake shots with fruit - sounds yummy!  The decor is now updated and more visually appealing, but it still has a bit of the old school Sweet Tomatoes charm.  As I never frequented Sweet Tomatoes before the change for anything but a salad, what I saw last week was encouraging and I'll definitely stop in later this month to check out the rest of the offerings."}
{"text":"In no way is this place a buffet like it used to be. I completely agree that their new concept is utterly confusing. I heard many people complaining about that while we were there. Whatever consultant told them to go to this format needs to be fired ASAP. Why any business would deliberately shoot themselves in the foot like this is beyond me. I had been to this Sweet Tomatoes numerous times and I have never seen it as empty as it was then (which was noon on a Saturday). The Soup & Salad accross the street from them must be ecstatic."}
{"text":"I used to eat here relatively often and my family has been a fan of Sweet Tomatoes for years. Unfortunately when I stumbled into the Field Kitchen I was not expecting the change and I was already a little grumpy and hungry. When the woman at the front door offered me my restaurant tutorial I really wanted to leave, but I decided to give it a shot.  The basic issue is not that you only get one trip to the salad bar. Most people never take advantage of unlimited trips to the salad bar, myself included, and I'm a salad fiend. They didn't make the salad mixing bowl too small. My complaint is that Field Kitchen has greatly reduced the number of healthy options available in the Sweet Tomatoes restaurant model. They reduced their lettuce options and all of their salad toppings. My biggest complaints are with their vegetable-based proteins (beans) and dressings (ST's original Greek dressing was gone in favor of a nasty, unhealthy cream based Greek and I had to take the dressing woman's word about and contents of her HFCS vinaigrette...instead I opted to pour straight vinegar on my poor salad). If you choose to use the salad bar, they only give you one cup for soup and three soup options...one cream based soup, one salty minestrone type of soup, and one nasty soup they like to call chicken noodle. You are also expected to fill your second side dish with a macaroni salad (yay, that sounds healthy!) or a fruit salad (nowhere to be found). You are also given an ice cream dish and if you are lactose intolerant, tough! Actually, the biggest problem for me was actually that I found no fruit in the whole establishment except for in the decor. There were no healthy dessert options at all.  So there you go...if you opt for the \"healthy\" meal option of the salad combo, you get unhealthy dressings, pasta salad, unhealthy soup and unlimited bread. That sounds reallly healthy, but then I forget ST's regular clientele. It's just sad because in the old model people actually had a choice, you know? I could eat my salad and chicken noodle and everyone else could have their Joan's broccoli salad and pizza bread.   This place also now has a bunch of overpriced booze and cupcakes and macarons the size of your head and greasy meat and overpriced soup (that used to be free) and veggies cooked in bacon. I can't speak to the quality of those things because I came for salad. I really wanted a corn bread muffin or a low fat blueberry muffin as a guilty treat, but they phased those out too."}
{"text":"Once I walked in, I was immediately approached by a greeter that introduced me to their Souplantation/Sweet Tomatoes new concept of field kitchen.  I was from out of town and thought this was going to be like the usual Souplantations in this area of Arizona filled with chain restaurants.  The workers are all really nice and friendly.  I got the create your own combo (i forgot what it was called) that comes with a create your own salad, a soup or macaroni choice, frozen yogurt, and bread.  While I like that they are trying to test something new at this location, I don't think this is yet.  By the end of my meal, I was quite disappointed.  I felt like I was being ripped off .  It's nearly the same cost as Souplantation with same quality, especially since they automatically charge tip, but it's not as much food.  Nothing was that special.  I came in quite hungry and left unsatisfied.  They did have other options, but the sandwiches and stuff seemed pricey for what souplantation quality is..."}
{"text":"We'll, they finally changed back to the original Sweet Tomatoes food, which is great! They kept some of the updated decor which is nice. The biggest problem now is the soda machine. They have one soda machine for the whole restaurant. It is the kind with the touch screen and different flavors for every kind of soda. It's great, but I've seen children and some older people get confused and it takes a little longer than usual. During busy times, there is typically a line. Added to this, the soda machine is incredibly inconveniently placed. The line blocks access to and from the hot food, the ice cream machine, and just traffic in general. Add another machine in a different location and the entire dining experience would be much improved."}
{"text":"Good news...Field Kitchen in Tempe, has been converted back to a Sweet Tomatoes. Where we were in the Sweet Tomatoes in Gilbert in January, we were told that the Field Kitchen idea had been the biggest mistake their company had ever made, and it was being converted back to the original. I guess they learned the hard way...\"don't fix it, if it ain't broke!\""}
{"text":"They clearly spent megabucks remodeling this place and made some bad mistakes in the process. If the trend is towards healthy eating options, they are moving in the opposite directions. Baked potatoes and yams have been replaces by smashed potatoes and other high-carb, high-fat options. Mac & cheese appears at two separate locations, just in case you miss the first. The 3 comes-with-the-salad soup choices were all sad, overcooked, under seasoned. The premium soups were no better. The cornbread was cold and lifeless. The dessert \"gourmet\" cookies were soggy and overly sweet. I rated it two stars because the greens were fresh, the decor was pleasant,  and the servers were totally sweet and over-the-top helpful. I give the place 6 months. Ninety percent of the time I eat at indie restaurants. Make that 95% now."}
{"text":"Rant and rave: (scroll down to see food and service details) Went to this location for sweet tomatoes however they have changed to a new concept called field kitchen.  A greater meet us, and nervously tried to explain the concept.  He focused on the build a bundle option probably because its the closest to what Sweet Tomatoes used to be.    We both ordered the bundle, however we made the mistake of ordering before we saw the salad bar (which is half of what the available selections used to be, or at least it seems like it).  I made my salad but was disappointe to see no egg, no bacos, no parmission cheese, and no blue cheese crumbles.  I made my salad the best I could but knew at that point I might have made a mistake.  \"Can I have your card please sir?\"  Chi-Ching.  I decided to also order the chicken ginger and garlic skewers thinking maybe that would makeup for the lack of ingredients in my salad.  I poured my soup and get a table.  Another card swipe, Chi-Ching  Went to get a coke, card sir!  Another Chi-Ching.  At this point I felt like I was being Nickle-n-dimed.  The soup was disappointing because the bundle didn't offer the chili, and the only option I remotely liked was the chicken noodle, so not wanting to complain I tried it.  --------------------------- Food run-down: -  Salad was boring, my partner couldn't use her dressing because it \"taste funny\"  and I gave up on mine after two bites because the only items I liked that they offered were corn and carrots...got bored of that real quick.  -  Chicken noodle soup was bland, like siping dishwater with lots of veggies in it...  -  No bread was offered to us, however we noticed it didn't look too great when we walked by it, so we skipped it.  -  The chicken skewers looked like the chicken was run over, toned up by the tires of a card, grilled and skewed.  They had no ginger taste, and definitely no garlic taste... I ate two bites and put the rest down.  - Dessert was a chocolate yogurt (no idea if it was low fat or not) and the dessert bar had no topping at all... Gone.  What's the point of having that dessert machine if there's nothing to put on you lump of poo-like chocolate.  Customer Service  -  Greater that meet us upon arriving was young, nervous and had a very hard time explaining the menu and card system... Tough we figured it out on our own  -  Gentlemen at the skewer station was nice but after I ordered he said it would be a few minutes and he would \"wonder around and find us\"... No numbers or card for the table... Not very professional  -  Waitress at table was also nice however when I said I didn't like any of it and she took my meal away, she didn't mention it to a manager, no supervisor came to ask us about our meal...nothing.  -  The cashier was also nice but when we asked how was everything I gave him this same rundown of complaints...  His response everytime I mentioned something negative was, so sorry for that...  Neither him or the gal standing next to him bothered to offer the meal for free or get a supervisor.  Just rang us up... $25...  For two people that barely touched their food and told staff we were unhappy.  Decor and seating:  - I like the color schemes and overall newness and updating of the location.  However we noticed these annoying light bulbs at each table where you can see the filament in each bulb just singing its impression on your eyes so that everywhere else you look you get that ghost affect from seeing something too bright, of too long...  Who thought of this and did they actually eat a meal next to these light bulbs?   Concept Field Kitchen - Epic Fail. Loyal sweet tomatoes fans not going back.  The extra kick is this was the closet location to us by a long shot...so that rules out eating at sweet tomatoes again...Time to find something else dear!"}
{"text":"Okay, first let me say, we didn't actually eat their food so I can't comment on how tasty (or not tasty) the their food is (although it did look good).  However, we went in thinking we were still going to Sweet Tomato only to be bombarded by a youngling waitress working their and wanted to show us a tour of their new place.  We left after the tour and here's why:  1. If you're going to have a different restaurant, stop calling it Sweet Tomatoes  2. WAAAAAY too cluttered.  I couldn't follow what the heck the waitress was saying.  She didn't even mention the part about using some kind of card that remembers everything you ordered and that's how your price total is tallied up.  Nor did she tell me that essentially, you pay everything a la carte - she kind of just tap danced around that part.  I had to research online to finally figure that out.  3. TOOOOO CONFUSING.  You go in there and you don't know where things start or end.  There's just too much going on and in the center there is a huge wine bar (I think that's what it was anyway) and I was just put off by that.  I guess it's not as family friendly as it used to be?  It was just too much to soak in.  I don't have time to go through a tutorial on a restaurant layout when I have a hungry 2 year old.  I was still confused by how the whole place works.  I had to look everything up online.  We may be back and try it sometime but if you don't feel like \"learning something new\" before eating your meal, I'd say skip it for the day.  Sorry Sweet Tomato but this is very disappointing and we are not ones to shy away from new things!  And yes, as other people mentioned, it does feel like you are getting \"nickel and dimed\" - another reason we chose to skip it.  Don't keep the Sweet Tomatoes name if you're not going to keep the same concept!"}
{"text":"Disappointed, concerned and a little pissed. This Sweet Tomatoes went upscale to become Field Kitchen. Customers like me came for the selection of fresh salad items, soups, breads and deserts in a buffet restaurant. NO LONGER. No more buffet. A la carte. I tried the help yourself salad bar. One visit to the salad bar with much less to choose from. Someone behind the counter  adds your salad dressing. 3 soups to choose from  and a cup for your frozen yogurt. One trip only. Drinks are available at a separate station. If you want water you get  a small plastic cup. They issue you a special card that keeps track of all your spending and you pay when you leave where the add an automatic service charge of 7.5% for tip. Trays are replaced with metal cookie sheets but there are no cookies. See pics posted. Everyone over 4 years old needs a card. No one leaves without having a card to present to cashier. $50 fine for losing card. This concept is ludicrous. My friends and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"What an awful, misguided, greedy idea.  They have killed the buffet concept, removed favorite food items, raised prices, and made getting a meal entirely too complicated.  I will drive the extra distance to go to the Sweet Tomatoes that hasn't been ruined, but I will never come back to Field Kitchen."}
{"text":"What have they done???  We walked in, got the \"tour\" of the new field kitchen model and walked out.   Too confusing, too expensive.   We loved the old Sweet Tomatoes. We wll not be back to that mess.  If its not broken, dont fix it. Whoever decided to change the concept thought they were smarter then they were. Dumb Idea."}
{"text":"I am VERY disappointed that our favorite local salad buffet had changed to this new place seemingly overnight without much, if any, warning.   But I was pleasantly surprised by my recent visit and give them 3 stars.   Here's why:  What's good: The build your salad ($6.99 for lunch) had just about everything I normally put on my salad.   Plus some nice extras such as apple slices, fresh pineapple, mini orange things, and edamame to name a few.   I got my dressings on the side in little cups.  The mango and sesame tasted great.  Quality was the same as the old ST.  You can build a salad that's twice the size as before since the new metal bowl is large and deep.  And since it's no longer a buffet, you can share a plate. (Or at least, we did without getting yelled at.)  The cream of mushroom soup was pretty damn good.      Bread selection was good.  Yogurt was the same as before.   Waffle bowl is better than the mini cake cones.    We also purchased some type of pomegranate drink which was good.  ($2.79) You can refill your glass with the standard sodas and teas afterward too, with no extra charge.  I tried the samples of cookies and they were all delicious. (comparable to Paradise or better)  I didn't buy any however.  ($1.99 each)  Tried 2 Mini-Cupcakes.  Red Velvet  and Vanilla.  ($.99 each).  Both were very good.    The décor was moderately updated.  Of course the food stations are all redone.  There are some new lights, upside-down hanging plants, random herbs, silverware buckets at each table, and of course the new metal trays and salad bowls, and updated ceramic dishes.  Customer service was just fine.  All the employees were in good spirits and very helpful.    What's not as good: Most obviously, the buffet aspect is gone.  No more seconds except for the bread.   The menu is all over the place, literally!  There's a monster huge one when you walk in.  Then there are smaller item menus at each food station.  It would be nice to have something on a piece a paper to look at and reference.    We had to repeatedly get up to see what's available.    There were very few or no labels for most of the salad bar, soup, and condiment items.  Many times I didn't know what was inside the dish.  What is vegetarian?  Does it have pork/bacon?  Nuts?   How about a list of the dressings, since there seems to be many unique ones now?  The fellow behind the counter had to recite them 3 times for us.   Chicken noodle soup didn't have noodles or big chunks of chicken like the old ST.   No premium vegetarian soups!    Corn bread was on the dry side.    No toppings for the yogurt.   The décor was only moderately updated.  The ugly nasty reddish carpet remains.   How many gallons of old salad dressing and food juice is half-lifeing on that old thing?    Also, the old ceiling fans were still there and were covered in a THICK layer of dust.  The place should be spotless after being redesigned.   For a \"new\" restaurant, we were never approached by any management types to ask us how we liked everything even though we saw them.    I really didn't like the swipe card.  I was nervous about losing the thing ($50 fine!) and watched it like a hawk.  You have to always have it with you, and be careful if the staff takes your tray and the card gets taken too.    Also the card can be a source of cross contamination (germs and bacteria) since it's being repeatedly handled by employees who have handled other cards who have been handled by other customer's dirty hands.    Seems some of the employees still need to study-up on the menu and procedures though, as a few of our questions could not be answered right away.  What's up with the service charge?  That's just low class.  People will leave a few bucks at the table if warranted.  But by adding it automatically, it guarantees nobody will leave it at the table while surprising the customer upon checkout and leaving them with a bad feeling about the place.   Other thoughts: There is potential to really play up the take-out aspect of this new concept.  For example, I could see myself swinging by for a few of those delicious cookies, cupcakes, or a bowl of soup or salad to-go.  I think it's possible, but it's not advertised and I didn't see any to-go containers.    You really can spend a little or a lot at this place.  It can definitely play well for parties where not everyone wants a salad.  (I'm fine with just cookies for dinner!)   I understand completely how the regulars are disappointed by the change.  Proper communications and setting our expectations way in advance would have made a world of difference.    BUT my first visit to FK wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  There's definitely room for improvement.  All things considered, I hope they succeed (or go back to the old ST.)"}
{"text":"I finally tried the new concept Field Kitchen for lunch today. I will miss eating at Sweet Tomatoes. What an utter failure of a concept. The decor and uniforms were an improvement. The cleanliness was improved. On to the food. The lettuce was wilted and soft. There were hard pieces of core and rib in the lettuce. The veggies had no flavor. The once flavorful brocolli salad was gross. The soup was the same. The dressing on the side let me avoid the swirling tossed salad thing. The girls working the beverage station were blank faced and bored. The bread was dry and stale. The music was loud and the light bulbs on the tables seared your eyes with a photgraphic effect meaning you just had to stare down at your plate. The chocolate frozen yogurt was SO bitter that we threw it away immediately. What an complete miss. Sweet Tomatoes has erred with this concept. It will NOT succeed unless they find a completely different clientelle. When I checked out, the card was still full from a previous users order. Five girls standing in the front and not one said goodbye or thanks. No one asked us how anything was. The food had no flavor whatsoever. Piles of salt didn't even help. Methinks they eliminated the MSG they swore they never used. DO NO bother even going to this new Field Kitchen if you are looking for the Sweet Tomatoes experience. The managers stand around looking useless and don't even pretend to offer customer service. The female hispanic manager is the worst cust. service provider I have ever met. They kept the creepy back of the house worker that is interested ONLY in staring at women and making us uncomfortable. Arrowhead will miss having a salad bar. I will not return to this terrible, terrible excuse for its former self. Sweet Tomatoes should fire whoever designed this debachle."}
{"text":"This concept is totally idiotic!  After having a bad day, we decided to go with some familiar comfort food.  Upon entering we knew that things were different and there was a nice young woman who was there to explain it all.  I was willing to give this a try, but we found out immediately that it's no longer a buffet.  I've never had to be given a tour with detailed instructions how to order at a restaurant before and still didn't understand.  It was move like we had to *trained* on how to order.  Each person gets a card with a magnetic stripe and you're expected to get it swiped at every station you go to.  A swipe for your salad.  A swipe for your soup.  A swipe for your meat.  Older people and families with lots of kids are really gonna hate this!  Then you pay at some register that's either in the soup section or the salad section.  I'm not sure which.  By that point at was so annoyed and had stopped paying attention and we left.  Admittedly, this review is not about the food, but the complete confusion we felt immediately despite their friendly and patient staff.  This is horrible idea and I hope abandon this test concept soon!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of good restaurants in the area and now is the time to try one.  I've been going to Sweet Tomatoes for a long time and those days are sadly over.  This place should be called the Head Ache.  The surrounding restaurants will surely see and increase in sales due to this flop.  I was so annoyed that I left laughing."}
{"text":"Just went to one of these for the first time, post conversion. As a PDMA (Product Development Management Association) member working toward NPDP certification, I'd love to know what research process led them to this model - it has some serious flaws. - When we came in, we essentially were given a \"class\" by a VERY soft-spoken hostess. She gave us \"Smart Cards\", including one for our two year old. We asked about that, and she took it back. - We just wanted \"Sweet Tomatoes\" - what we had grown to expect. It was there, with some differences. There was the \"Smart Card\" swipe, with no real explanation. The salad bar was the usual - and good. But only three choices of soups, plus a little dish of mac and cheese. There was no indication that there might be more elsewhere, or if we'd be expected to pay more for it. The dressings were rather runny, and doled out by the cupful by a person behind the counter - you're out of control in regard to whether you want to add more or less, or mix dressings. - There was no real explanation about drinks. There were three of us. I wandered around finally asked someone \"How do I... wind up with a beverage?\" He pointed me at the beverage island - which is actually separate from the actual beverages - to get glasses. I was there with two other adults, and I told the girl at the counter that I needed three glasses. She swiped all three cards. I mentioned that two were for water. She UN-swiped two cards. Good thing I mentioned it, or I'd have been charged for three fountain beverages. There was no indication of how to ask for a glass for water, and not be charged. - Apparently, fresh bread is included, but this was never explained to us, nor did we see where the bread was, or how to get it without having the \"Smart Card\" swiped. We skipped the bread. - The \"Smart Card\" in particular, isn't very \"smart.\" It's confusing. There is no way to know what you've spent without trying to keep track of it in your head, or writing it down as you go. It's a standard magnetic swipe card. The \"instructions\" for the restaurant, written in the menu, make it very clear that anyone over the age of 4 HAS to have a \"Smart Card\" to exit the restaurant, even if all the food is purchased on one card. There's a note on the back that a \"lost or damaged\" \"Smart Card\" will result in a $50 charge. More than the lost ticket charge at most airport parking garages. Just the NAME of the card is intimidating - \"SMART Card\" implies that if you're confused by it, or don't understand... you're not \"Smart.\" - They add a 7.5% gratuity, without asking. If you want to remove it, I assume you have to sort of make a scene to do so - which many people would be embarrassed to do. - The tableware and napkins were in galvanized buckets on the table. I'm no \"germophobe\", but that sort of \"squicks me out.\" What happened to that tableware prior to my arrival? Did anyone sneeze? Use it, wipe it, and put it back? And why is everything stuffed point down into a bucket? How clean is that bucket? And why no napkin dispenser? We're very informal at home, except for special occasions, but at least we have a napkin holder and silverware tray. - I counted at least 2.5x as many employees as before. Add that up, salary plus benefits. There was a whole person swiping cards, another doling out dressing, another swiping cards and giving glasses. There were also a lot of hosts/hostesses sort of wandering around, answering questions. - The core demographic for Sweet Tomatoes tended to be older people - seniors. I asked a hostess how it was going, and she confirmed this. She said that most long-time customers were NOT returning after an initial visit post-conversion. The best way to get a senior customer in particular to not return is to make them feel confused and stupid, and I got the impression that \"Field Kitchen\" was doing just that. Add in the implied intimidation of the possible charge associated with a \"lost or damaged\" Smart Card.... and you have a perfect way to get your core customers to try something else. On the other hand, the food was good, and the staff was nice, though visibly frustrated at times. While we exited (with Smart Cards firmly in hand!) another customer was asking for the manager, to explain what her bill came to, and why. All in all... I'm not really certain what VoC or focus group/1:1 exercises Garden Fresh went through to arrive at this, but their participants, moderators, inquiry structure, ethnographics, and interpretation matrix should probably be re-examined. I didn't get the impression that the piece they've created fits the puzzle. From another article I read (this post is mostly transcribed from a comment I left there) I understand that Garden Fresh spent two years, $2MM, and hired 250 new employees to run this experiment. I'm genuinely interested in knowing how they arrived at... THIS... from a professional basis, so I don't make the same mistakes."}
{"text":"Well we had not been to Sweet tomatoes for a while now. So when we got coupons on line yesterday we thought we would go. Drove over here and guess what it was closed. Nothing good about that. Though the sign said they will be opening in a few weeks. If they sent us a coupon they know which one we go to the most. We used to go here at least every 2 weeks. They should of let us know this location was closed. You know they track you when you use coupons."}
{"text":"This restaurant changed format about 4 weeks ago, according to the staff, and I have to say that the changes are an utter failure for me...   Used to be a relatively healthy buffet with great build-your-own salad variety along with soups, comfort foods, and desserts. Most of the key ingredients are still there, but they've changed to an a la carte system that requires you to tote around a hotel-key style card to register your purchases as you go. I had the salad bar, which includes a few basic soup choices. Their better soups are now \"premium\" upgrades that are not included in the salad bar price like they used to be. The chicken noodle soup was especially disappointing, as they used to have a very tasty made-from-scratch soup with thick noodles and good-sized chunks of meat. The new chicken noodle soup tasted alright, but not nearly the quality of what they served before. I would also note that the chicken noodle soup looked / tasted suspiciously like Progresso. Salad dressing was a huge letdown, as well. I poured the house Ranch dressing on my salad and ate my soup. When finished with the soup, I turned back to my salad to discover that the dressing had completely settled at the bottom of the salad bowl leaving a thin watery residue across the top of my salad - are they actually watering down their dressing now? The basic salad bar includes a bowl of frozen yogurt, but devoid of all the toppings choices (nuts, sprinkles, hot fudge, caramel, etc) that they used to offer.   The drink tender asked me how I was doing and I said, \"Fine. How are you?\" He said, \"Well, been dealing with some complaints lately.\" I told him I could see why and that I didn't really care for the new format. He suggested just piling the salad bowl as high as you can and making do - since you only get one trip through the salad line now, he seemed to assume that my disappointment was limited to the loss of making return trips for salad. Even the staff seems a bit weary of dealing with customer confusion and dissatisfaction since the changes. Upon leaving, I found that the prices are about 20% higher than before and they automatically add a 7.5% gratuity to your bill unless you object to it at the register (a small note on the register screen flashes that notice as you checkout - blink and you'll miss it). I noticed that they've removed quite a few tables to create more space in the restaurant and yet there were more open tables there than I'd ever seen before - an indicator that their clientele is expressing disapproval also?  Overall, the food is still good qualty (which is why I still rated it 2 stars), but I think that they've gone cheapskate in a few key areas while raising prices, most notably in reducing the add-in options when building your salads, downgrading the chicken noodle soup, charging extra for most of their soups, skimping on the dressings (maybe watering them down too?), and going away from a buffet and more towards a cafeteria style experience. Needless to say, the changes are pretty dramatic and I don't think a single one of them was implemented with the goal of improving the diner's experience. I reckon the new format will increase the restaurant's profit margin quite a bit in the short-term but will wind up driving away many loyal diners once they've experienced the new format once or twice. I and the other members of my party all expressed that we don't think that we'll come back after sensing the downgrades. If you've never eaten here before, you may like the new style. If you have eaten here before, I can pretty much guarantee that you won't like the changes that they've made."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this location and the way they added gratuity into our bill.. We had absolutely no service from any type of server! We were frequent patrons... We will gladly drive to metro center to get our Sweet Tomato fix. I would rate zero stars if it were possible!"}
{"text":"The terrorists are winning.  Lol.   Bring back regular sweet tomatoes... Somewhere some CEO needs to be fired.  I could go on and on but I will not,  just go somewhere else for your salad fix.    I did enjoy watching people walk around confused about what to do next."}
{"text":"I Liked the ordering process since you can take some time at your seat and look at the menu but the paper menu is impossible to read. Look at the website the paper menu is half the size  and the ingredients listed just look like squiggles. Also on the website the left end of the menu is cut off and you can't see all the ingredients in the salads.    I thought the \"Hippy Grains and Kale Salad\" actually sounded really good. Mixed Greens, Kale, Bamboo Rice, Wheat Berries, Lentils and I think Orzo and some other stuff. I thought with all the stuff in it I really wanted it healthy and I thought I didn't need the orzo filler added to it. So I asked the worker if orzo could be not added to my salad and she said, \"what is orzo?\". I tell her it's the rice shaped pasta. She still doesn't understand and gets another worker and I ask her if they can leave out the orzo and she also ASK ME \"what is orzo?\" and tell tell her and she doesn't have a clue. I thought maybe with the fist worker it was a language barrier since she had an accent but the second worker should have understood me.   It's a possibility that orzo isn't in this salad and it's in another  salad I saw but I know I saw orzo on the board where you order. My husband wanted to leave at this point because he didn't think I should have to inform them on what one of the ingredients they use are.  We left and went to the only independently owned eatery in the shopping center (the Hawaiian one) and had a nice lunch anyway.  I'll give them another try sometime and just eat the effen orzo."}
{"text":"I'm so angry and confused right now. Whoever came up with this concept should be beaten severely. I can't imagine how the elderly are taking it. I'd rather have hoards of obese children running and screaming, than this abomination."}
{"text":"I had seen the emails stating there were changes to the local Sweet Tomatoes, yet I was surprised when we pulled into the parking lot at dinner time and saw no cars.  The food tasted good, but if you are a fan of Sweet Tomatoes, you will be disappointed to see many favorites gone. No more blueberry muffins, minimal choices on soups, no chili unless you buy it ala cart. My children were disappointed to see no more brownies and pizza, and no toppings for their frozen yogurt.  They had very little signage on ingredients. As a vegetarian, I found it very difficult to determine beyond the vegetables what was vegetarian or not. They had some pasta and cous cous salads but it was tough to determine the ingredients. They no longer had the potato bar and the vegan margarine. They did have some additional ingredients in the salad bar (or at least that I may have not noticed before), mixed bell peppers, some seeds (chia seeds?), and dehydrated cranberries.   The shopping ala cart is just not a good experience.  If I had gone to this restaurant not expecting Sweet Tomatoes perhaps it would warrant more stars. Unfortunately, by branding it as a Sweet Tomatoes Field Kitchen you go in expecting a Sweet Tomatoes experience. You do not get it here.   We were not told of the $50 fee for losing the card, as other reviewers mentioned. They gave us a card for each person in our group so I don't know how they would even know if we lost a card when we went to check out.   Would I go back? If someone else wanted to go, I'd go with them and I'd eat and be content. But, I don't see myself being a regular any more, nor would I expect to go with my kids. As others have stated, this was a kid-requested place for birthday dinners and family nights out. It was a great place that had something for everyone.    I hope that Sweet Tomatoes does not convert its other Phoenix restaurants to this \"concept,\" though our next closest Sweet Tomatoes is now about 50 minutes away. Bye bye Sweet Tomatoes. You will be missed. :-("}
{"text":"Let me be short and sweet....  Nice people.  Salad items no better than Sweet Tomato - maybe not as good.  Same lousy soup.  Same crummy hot plates.  Horrible wine selection.  Not worth geting out of your car."}
{"text":"I've been to Sweet Tomatoes a few times and I have to say, I like the new changes they're making.  The whole look on the inside is different - and in a good way. I like the new decor right when you walk in. It's a nice change, and makes everything look more modern and fresh.  As far as the food goes, I also like the new additions. I had the rotisserie chicken and the creamed corn and both were pretty darn good.  Overall - it's nice to see them evolving and changing things up."}
{"text":"This new \"Field Kitchen\" concept is designed to nickel & dime customers and it absolutely succeeds in doing one thing: loosing repeat customers.  Basically, the new model is not the fixed-price buffet that has existed in the past.  Instead, you now get a card which you swipe when you purchase separate items.  I have been a loyal Sweet Tomatoes (aka. Souplantation in So. Cal) customer since the mid-80's and I want nothing to do with this new concept.  It's obvious that they didn't take care in completing a customer consensus before switching to this model as other reviews echo my own sentiments and observations.     I will miss my Sweet Tomatoes though and I hope & pray that they will revert to the beauty that was."}
{"text":"Critical Miss.  Jokingly someone at lunch said \"what, did they get a new CEO\".   Before posting this review I did a little research, yup, new CEO-June 2012.  Go Figure.  My complaint is I don't think they know who their customers are or were in my case.  This concept tries to be partly what it 'was' and then something different?  The layout is a bad idea and confusing.  At least they should have re-done the front end.  The soup that I loved so much are narrowed down to three (and only one cup is all you get or pay more) and really that's what I truly liked the best of the old ST's.  I just don't get it.  It's way too complicated and it's just not worth going because seriously there are lots lots lots of places to get good salads.  So what is the \"value add\" of this concept.    A positive side (maybe) is there is a lot less food waste.  You just don't get to load up and bunch of food, seconds and take two bites and be done with it.  I am quickly going to the remaining ST's to enjoy one last tour around the soup bar!  Field Kitchen, meh.  Sorry, I will spend my $ elsewhere."}
{"text":"It was a long day of shopping and we were starving so we decided to try Sweet Tomatoes Field Kitchen. We used to eat here and its been about two years since we were here. As we enter we see about ten employees look at us like \"here we go again\". So as we are seated they give us a menu and try to go over it with us, we ask a lot of questions trying to understand this \"charge for this & this & this & this concept\" so I see the girl seating us is getting tired of answering so many questions so I tell her thank you and that we will get it from here. She than gives us a Card that we need to give to each station as we get food and tells us if we lose it its a $50 charge. She leaves and we just look at each other and just try to soak all this in and have that feeling of just leaving but we are so hungry that I just want to eat anything and dont want to travel again. We after just sitting there for about five minutes STILL trying to get up the courage to leave, we see about NOT KIDDING eight couples get seated, get read the menu and get the courage to just walk out. After the fifth couple leaving we are just giggling about it and start to make bets about who we think is going to leave next.  After all that we still decide to try it out and eat. Well yes they do charge you for every little thing you get, when all I wanted was a buffet salad bar. No one came to check up on us, many employees were just grouped together and talking to each other. A lot of customers as confused as us and leaving and a lot of empty tables. And after ALL that they charged us a HIDDEN 7.5% gratuity FEE!!!!!! Who ever thought of this idea to change Sweet Tomatoes to this Field Kitchen concept should be fired. I drive by here every day and see the parking lot always empty and now this place is known as the \" Remember when we went to Sweet Tomatoes Field Kitchen \" joke. I will NEVER go back here and I will WARN everyone about this place. What a shame."}
{"text":"Unlike the other reviewers, I like the new Sweet Tomatoes Field Kitchen.  I ordered the California Cobb Salad and it was excellent.  I appreciated purchasing a salad with upgraded ingredients like fresh avocado and rotisserie chicken. My friend ordered the brisket sandwich. It was excellent too.  I like the idea of having many different salad and hot food selections to choose from and not just salad and soup.  Honestly I was tired of the old Sweet Tomatoes.   Yes the concept is different and yes the first visit can be a bit overwhelming but the end result is a much better restaurant with a variety of food offerings. Come on people, give it a chance and don't be so critical of change. Change is good. I will be back."}
{"text":"poorly organized.  poor service. hate the field kitchen. the old way was amazing. disappointed with the changes."}
{"text":"Yeah Just got an email they will be converting the FK's back to Sweet Tomatoes.  I used to love, love this place but now.... A terrible experience. The great old place is now gone. People were turning around and walking right back out the door while we were scratching our heads trying to figure out the wall sized menu which is massively confusing  not to mention the idiotic set up and hoops you have to jump thru just to get your meal. Now I wish we'd left too and went over to one of the other eating places in the lot  By the time my daughter and granddaughter got their food  My soup was cold from waiting for them it took so long. SO if you are on a lunch break forget it. You will not have enough time to eat if you get anything beside the salad bowl and cup of soup  And now for $6.99 you get only a cup of soup period , a  non refillable salad and bread and a frozen yogurt cup.  The ranch dressing has also been watered and is now flavorless Well I don't eat the bread or yogurt there. So I didn't end up with any variety and that was boring too.  Everything else is extra and they give you this stupid credit card thing they swipe at each station and you pay on the way out. If you lose the card they charge you $50.00 and you need a card for each person over the age of 4. There was also an additional $1.50 SERVICE CHARGE tacked onto the bill as well. Seeing that we served ourselves I have no clue what that was. Too bad we left as much of a tip as we did since we were charged extra.  The mushroom soup  that use to be great was an awful gummy mess  and I actually got sick with terrible cramps about a half hour after eating and had to go running around looking for a bathroom while still on the road and afraid I would not make it to a bathroom in time. I have never gotten sick on their food before  The girls has the rotisserie chicken with the mashed potatoes. The potatoes were awful and bland and the chicken was way too salty and they left 3/4 of the food on their plates  it was so bad. I understand the chicken soup is no longer good either. People around us were also grumbling with dissatisfaction over the change The only good thing I can say is they did spruce it up inside. But I'm not there for just the decor  If they have sense they will go back to the way it was. I'd be willing to pay a higher price if it was the same. After 6 years of eating there at least twice a month, we will not be going back. It's 4 hours and a dose of Pepto later and I still feel ill as I write this. A little addition here I also posted on their Facebook page about getting sick on the food. They said they would get back to me shortly and never did. They are also sanitizing that page of all the horrible reviews they are getting and only  leaving up what you can only think are shill reviews. But it won't work. Sadly it's all over Sweet Tomatoes.   Little update: we tried the new Sizzler on Country Club & Southern and it was great. Tons of fresh veggies on the unlimited salad bar including peel and eat shrimp, avocados and even whole hard boiled eggs. Also tons of other prepared choices like crab salad and so forth. Three soup choices too. And you also get the taco bar which includes hot wings, pasta with meatballs and sauce. Vanilla soft serve for desert . So if you are anywhere in the area there is another option"}
{"text":"I have been waiting a while to write this review because I was torn. I am always on the hunt for farm fresh, healthy food. I find that the west valley is seriously lacking in this type of cuisine. I think it is a great idea to bring this here, and if it was done right, it would be successful. For example, Paradise and Jasons deli are always packed. Also a Wildflower bread is on its way, and I think it will do well.  I think Field Kitchen would have done a lot better if it was opened in its own location, and not taking out a crowd favorite of Sweet tomatoes. There are many loyal sweet tomatoes customers who are upset about the change. Try this in an empty building, don't take peoples favorite thing away. This building was not designed for their new concept and just trying to fit it in the cheapest way possible. The flow and feel of a restaurant is very important. It sets the whole foundation for the experience. The flow here is off like many reviewers have pointed out. What was a good idea, had poor execution.  Anyways, we went to this on the opening day. I was excited but wary because of the change and the increase in prices. Again, I would have been a lot more excited if it wasnt at the expense of the normal sweet tomatoes and at a separate place. But being the food adventurer and wanting something healthy, we wanted to give it a shot. The first thing my husband noticed was the change of staff. There were a lot of hipster young kids. I am not sure where they came from, maybe somewhere in the east valley. I guess they are trying to market towards a younger edgier crowd than the traditional patrons. We went through the same spiel as the others when we sat down. It was a confusing concept but we got it. I am not a fan of confusing concepts but they dont break it for me. For example, I still love Paradise even though the different stations are a little confusing too but maybe because I was introduced to Panera first and they have a better flow.  Anyways, my parents went first. My dad is hard of hearing, and I don't think he got it, and he got frustrated and just ended up with a bowl of chili and did not want to go back to get something else. So he was pretty hungry by the end. My mom ordered one of the gourmet salads. She was very disappointed. She ordered a chef salad, and there was barely anything on it. I think they missed half of the ingredients, and put some flaccid meat on it. It was a terrible looking sad face salad. Next, we went up. I wanted to try one of their gourmet salads. The salad maker was so excited that I wanted to try one because not many people were, but then I asked if soup and stuff were included and was told No. Um, what? I am paying a premium price for this salad and I can't hit the soup bar? That is messed up to me, especially since you order in the same line. So I cancelled that, and got the soup and salad bar. My salad was good. I can't think of any topping I was missing. I did miss the premade salads like the asiago cesear and coleslaws. I got the the dressing spinner, and picked out a dressing. I didnt like that the dressing went all over the bowl, I had some things that I did not want dressing on. It was annoying, and I mean seriously, paying someone to do that is a waste.  Then,  I got to the 3 soup choices. I was thoroughly disappointed that I could have soup or macaroni and cheese.   I also did not like that it wasn't all you can eat. Most salad bars are all you can eat. That is the appeal of having to make your own salad, so you can try different things. Jason's deli has a small salad bar, but its delicious and you can go back. What are they doing differently that Field Kitchen cant do?  The bread station was good. I didnt taste any difference in the butters. It seemed like a marketing trick to think you are getting gourmet butter, but there is really nothing different or special. We didn't bother with the yogurt. Our experience was just lacking that we wanted to get out of there. Its sad. I think that it was a poor execution to try and get more money out of their customers and they took a crowd favorite out. Now we will never have a sweet tomatoes by us.  We have gone to the metrocenter one a few times, but not to the extent we were frequenting the Arrowhead location.   Will we be back? Probably not, I will just go to Jason's Deli, Paradise, or Wildflower."}
{"text":"Okay, we tried it tonight.  I went with my two small children - aged 2 and 6.  The 2-year-old was free, and I found out he will continue to be free when he turns 3 in a few weeks.  That 's nice.  Field Kitchen was better than I expected it to be, but my question is - why mess with a good thing?  Sweet Tomatoes was awesome.  Field Kitchen is just okay.  I asked my 6-year-old daughter to tell me what she liked more about Field Kitchen than Sweet Tomatoes and here is what she told me: Cranberries  Okay, then I asked her what she liked more about Sweet Tomatoes than Field Kitchen, and this is what she told me: Field Kitchen doesn't have a Sundae bar (Field Kitchen doesn't carry any toppings for the frozen yogurt - not even sprinkles!)  Field Kitchen doesn't have pizza  Field Kitchen seems really big, which she doesn't like - she told me it was overwhelming She tried the Rotisserie chicken and didn't like it.  Waste of money.  Other than the pizza and sundae bar, my daughter actually ate pretty much the same thing that she would have it we were at Sweet Tomatoes, and for the same price.  So some things changed, and I suppose that she eats more healthfully without the sundae bar and the pizza.  Is that the point?    Here are my PROs and CONs about Field Kitchen: PROs Nice presentation on the salad bar Pesto pasta salad Salad was fresh and delicious as usual  CONs - Price went up for less food (with coupon, Sweet Tomatoes dinner was $8.29, now Field Kitchen is $8.99) - Salad bar no longer has banana squash.   - My favorite salad dressings were gone - Catalina and fat-free ranch - The layout is confusing; I had to ask several different times to find things \"Where do I get a water cup?\" \"Where is the ice cream?\"  I also wandered around looking for the bread.   - Soup selection included with the salad bar is mediocre at best. - Cornbread is way too big, and does not taste very good - the Sweet Tomatoes cornbread muffins were much better - Bread selection is tiny - where are the chocolate muffins?  Blueberry?  Fun flavor-of-the-month muffins?  Foccaccia?    The bread tonight was too fancy and my kids wouldn't even try it. - No more potatoes - sweet, white, or otherwise - No more grapes, fresh oranges, or sugar-free pudding - Service was terrible; we were pretty much ignored after we sat down; no one offered us a to-go container or even checked on us so we could ask for one - I usually tip at Sweet Tomatoes, but it's most always warranted.   The automatic 7.5% gratuity is insulting.  I usually tip more than that.  Although today 7.5% was about right for the service I received. - I get the point of the cards - how else can you keep track of an a la carte restaurant?  But, it's gross.  Are they cleaned between users?  I had to take mine into the bathroom with me.  No, nothing gross happened but it could, right? - The buckets of silverware on the table have to go.  My daughter LOVED having it, mind you, but my kids couldn't keep their hands off of the silverware.  They kept touching it, and not just the handles.  I pulled the silverware out so that the next person wouldn't use it, but is everyone else as considerate? - My kids didn't like the rotisserie chicken.  I'm a vegetarian, so I can't judge it,but normally they eat chicken.  I wasted $1.49 on that plate of chicken.  Oh well.  Live and learn.  Well, that's it.. my Pros and Cons about Field Kitchen.  We will probably go back, but not near the frequency we used to go to Sweet Tomatoes (was once per week).  Field Kitchen is mostly okay.  I just don't understand why Sweet Tomatoes felt the need to change so much?  They had a great thing going - the place was always full and busy whenever we went (Wednesday nights normally, but we've gone other times, too).  Tonight I saw several people walk out when they realized the Field Kitchen was so different.  One family even sat at their table and studied the menu for about 5-7 minutes before walking out.  The problem is - Field Kitchen is not unique.  You could go to Paradise Bakery and get a very similar experience.    It wasn't terrible, but it just wasn't great."}
{"text":"I just don't understand.  Even with the coupons offered, Sweet Tomatoes had to make money!  It was by far one of the most popular restaurants in my family and with several friends.  The new concept just falls flat on my expectations.  The food quality was good, but the menu was a mess!  I walked away feeling as if I over paid too under the a la cart system.  I know the place is new, and they want their customers to walk in with an open mind.  However the bottom line is I was let down and am happy to make the longer drive to the few remaining original Sweet Tomatoes."}
{"text":"I always love coming here.  Everything taste's so good and fresh!! The new layout is awesome, and the soda machine has hundreds of different flavors to try!!  love the updated place more than the old!!"}
{"text":"The food was fine, or just as fine as I found it before. The issue is the concept. Swiping a card everywhere I go? If you have to have a ton of staff just to show people how the restaurant works, you're doing something wrong. I watched our \"guide\" bump into two different people as he showed us around, which goes to show that everyone else was just as disoriented as we were.   Keep it simple!"}
{"text":"we were surprised at the change. we didn't know when we went there that they had undergone such a transfermation. but we were pleased with the quality of the food for the price. we just went for the basic salad and soup deal, and were pretty happy with it. while it's true that on most items it is no longer buffet (one trip through only), it is still a great deal! they give you a giant bowl to create a salad, and they now let you bring home your leftovers. for around $8 per person (including automatic gratuity, and tax) we recieved an abundance of tasty, fresh food. thumbs up. the people who don't like the new prices/procedures are going to mostly be folks who just don't like the change from an all buffet set-up, or the ones who are just too confused/challenged to understand the new card deal....it is a bit confusing at first, but it works. one more note; while nearly everything on the salad bar was good, stay away from their potato salad...it's awful (too much sweet relish makes it unbearable!)."}
{"text":"Field Kitchen threw away everything good Sweet Tomatoes had to offer. Don't bother wasting your time -- increased pricing, charges for every little thing. Not worth it. Terrible business idea. Families -- no longer free ice cream for kids. Incredibly disappointed and will not return. You can only go up to the salad bar once now, even if you don't order a la carte. Seems like they were trying to lower food costs and destroyed their core business in transition."}
{"text":"Field Kitchen is closed! They are switching it back to the original Sweet Tomatoes and will reopen in April."}
{"text":"The \"Sweet Tomatoes\" that we love for years is sadly gone. The Field Kitchen is truly a disappointment. It is more expensive, you pay more and you get less.  Not sure if I can say taste better, just taste different. And where is my must have wonton chicken salad!!?? Its gone! Chicken noodle soup is not even the same!   Sweet Tomatoes, we go to the old \"Sweet Tomatoes\" on a weekly basis for many years, and if you care big fan customer like me. Please don't remodel the rest of your locations, cuz I will not go to Field Kitchen!"}
{"text":"i was hesitant about the change but gave it a shot. you can still do the \"make your own salad\" bar with some soups and the same mac n cheese they used to have.  but you can also do a fancy-pants salad. i got the california cobb. it had this awesome chunky shredded turkey that they now roast on site. tasted like legit roasted turkey, not a preprocessed slab of meat. and this salad was, i think, cheaper than the old sweet tomatoes salad bar.  didnt get to try any deserts though, they were all sold out on the night i went.  biggest complaint, i guess, was that i wish they woulda given me an actual cup for water, not some rinky-dink 6oz plastic thing."}
{"text":"Fear not Sweet Tomatoes fans.  I just received an email from saying they have \"heard my feedback\" and are changing it back to the way it was \"sweeter than ever\".  I guess the 2.5 stars it received was enough to give it a second thought and pull the plug.    I think if they went ahead and converted all the restaurants to Field Kitchen it would have bankrupted the company.  Good riddens."}
{"text":"OMG-Bring back the regular Sweet Tomatoes.  The place is a disaster.  You walk in and are confronted by chalkboard menu that is overwhelming and a hostess who has to explain everything to you.  They still have a do it yourself salad bar that is a scaled down and not for the better version of the old Sweet Tomatoes, except you have a server who doles out the watered down salad dressing to you in individual paper cups. You end up paying more and getting less than the original concept.  They also have taken away their great strawberry lemonade. Even though you are with your family you are all given your own order cards---dumb.  Suffice it to say we will never go back to a Field Kitchen and will just have to drive further to a original Sweet Tomatoes.  Decor was only slightly modified from the old place and still has the gross original sweet tomatoes carpet."}
{"text":"Ok, so ST is OPEN again. . . .back to being a Sweet Tomatoes . . . well, more or less. Some positive changes, some negative. Still a little confusing when you first enter. Actually had to ask a couple of questions before we could get started. It wasn't all intuitive, like the old Sweet Tomatoes used to be. And the price for \"Salad & Soup\" has jumped. The increase is not just a few cents, but a few dollars.   It seems they have fewer choices than they used to have under the old Sweet Tomatoes umbrella . . . and they have \"extras\" that, of course, cost extra on top of the increased price. Yes, the cost of food has gone up while they were playing this game of \"up-scaling', but not that much. It seems we are paying for what it cost them to give the Field Kitchen a try and then return to the old version.  I will continue to go to ST, because I can still get a salad prepared to my liking - when I put it on the plate myself; but I will go less often to compensate for the increased prices.   To Whomever is the Parent Company of Sweet Tomatoes: Next time think changes through more carefully & thoroughly, before you dump them out there. Even Test Changes.  This one was a fiasco and still isn't back to the great alternative ST was before  . . . ."}
{"text":"They should have learned:  \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"    My wife and I used to go to Sweet Tomatoes probably twice a month.  I will never step foot in the Field Kitchen again.    They took a perfectly good place and ruined it.  When you enter, they explain how the restaurant works and hand you a card, which you have to swipe pretty much everywhere for pretty much everything.  It's a constant reminder that they're nickel-and-diming you to death.    You can now choose a \"prepared\" salad (for $7.99 or so - swipe!) or you can proceed to the \"make your own\" salad bar (for $7.99 or so - swipe!).  They hand you a tray with an oversized metal bowl with handles on each size (kind of like a small bucket), a soup cup, and a waffle cone thingy that you're supposed to use for frozen yogurt (which they say is unlimited).  You now get one trip through the salad bar, so load that sucker up, whether you plan to eat it all or not.  They have three soups to choose from now at the do-it-yourself line.  The rest of the soup varieties are available later (for a price - swipe!).  You will eventually get down the line and notice that the salad dressings are behind the counter.  Apparently, you are not responsible enough to dole out your own salad dressings these days, so you have to ask someone behind the counter to do it for you.  Awesome.    From there, proceed to the drink station and purchase a drink (swipe!).  Then, grab your bucket of salad and head back to the serve-yourself soda machine.  Then, head back to the bread area and load up on the unlimited bread.  While you're there, take the time to review the various menus overhead.  Want a bowl of soup?  Swipe your card for $3.49.  Want a skewer of meat?  Swipe!  Want pretty much anything else?  Swipe!  I told my wife to take her card to the bathroom, in case you had to swipe your card to get into the stall these days.    On the way out, you swipe your card and find out how much you owe.  For your added convenience, they automatically add a gratuity, regardless of whether you saw a waitress that night or not.  Awesome!    The only thing that could have made this dining experience worse is if they sent the information on your card to the Federal Government and you had to pay an additional tax based on the calories you had that evening.    Goodbye Sweet Tomatoes.  I'll miss you."}
{"text":"My little one and I were excited to get some Sweet Tomatoes. We were craving the soups, salads, and other goodies. Being a budget minded mother, Sweet Tomatoes is pocket friendly and reasonably healthy. It's also laid back.   After today, I'm sad to say I won't be visiting the Tempe Sweet tomatoes anymore because if I wanted to spend $10.00+++ on a bowl of soup and some dingy salad I'll go somewhere else.   What made Sweet Tomatoes a success was that it was a buffet. I honestly foresee this as a flop."}
{"text":"I am sorry to report that this concept for a make-over of Sweet Tomatoes is a disaster with a capital D.  The food is good.  The problem is that it is virtually impossible for a first-time customer to figure out how to eat.  The fact that a hostess is stationed at the front door to give step-by-step directions to order should be a red flag to any diner.  I ordered a \"designer\" salad at the first station, while my two dining companions ordered the traditional ONE TRIP ONLY salad bar.  While they ate their salads, I sat at the table for a good 20 minutes before my salad was delivered to the table.  It was good, but why did it take 20 minutes to put together a salad at 2:30pm on a Tuesday afternoon when the place was empty??  At the end of the day, I figure that the marketing people decided to remake Sweet Tomatoes into a trendy Paradise Bakery/Chipotle/former Sweet Tomatoes/wine bar.  Note to corporate:  This concept does not work.  The marketing gurus at corporate struck out big-time with this concept.    I can only hope and pray that the corporate big shots will swallow hard, admit their mistake, and convert the Field Kitchens back to normal and beloved Sweet Tomatoes before it is too late and they lose their loyal clientele.  Sweet Tomatoes was a happy, multi-generational place.  Field Kitchen appeals to...well...nobody.  It is sad.  Very, very sad."}
{"text":"Cafeteria style now, but more confusing.  You pay for what you pick out and put on your tray, but you can't do little portions as you could in the buffet - so do you really want to pay X amount extra for that macaroni 'n cheese?  The new theme of pre-sorted menu items and portions is a loser for me, and I'd wager it will be for many who liked the old format.  Plus it is incredibly confusing as you look at the menu with some items having large price tags like $7-9 but then some having smaller ones like $2 or so because some are add-ons and others are straight up entree portions.  They've gone so far as to have a dedicated explainer working at the front to help you understand it, and offer you a walk-through the restaurant in case you're still confused.  The fact that they anticipated this problem and had to come up with this as a solution is itself a problem.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Booo field kitchen. You suck in so many ways. You think you are so damn fancy. The upcharge for crappy salad and limited selection of soups was not warranted. I DO NOT need somebody to toss my salad or pour my dressing for me, thanks. I also think that your drinks and additional items are a huuuuge rip off. You are ostracizing your original customer base by enforcing a one time through trip to the salad/soup bar. Do you really think that the customers that frequented your establishment are going to think that the decrease in value is worth it now because you put some fresh rosemary in a tiny vase at each table and planted some lettuce out front? I got news for you field kitchen...you are digging yourself in deep this time. Oh and the tip you slipped in to everybody's check? Classy touch."}
