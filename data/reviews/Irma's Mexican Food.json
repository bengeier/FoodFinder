{"text":"This little hole in the wall should stay that way. My husband, son and I ate here. All got separate meals and all got sick to our stomachs. Never eating here again!!!"}
{"text":"Chorizo burrito con papas, juevos, queso y arroz is always good.  Grab the salsa verde to kick it up a bit  ;) Been going for years, always good. Park in the street, tight parking"}
{"text":"Ok I'm from Chicago so I'm used to great mexican food... First of all the tacos are super tiny, secondly the meat is bland and had fatty pieces everywhere third of all they barely put any cheese on my tacos and fourthly the service was slow... I will not be back"}
{"text":"Only reason this place is getting 3 stars is my parents liked the food. I thought that it was not so good. They had red chili that was made with canned tomatoes & green chili that was good but both were watered down. The bean seems to be blended & also watered down. I had the Chili Verde which was not green but a brown/red color. I added the table chili to add flavor. My parents had breakfast plates which they enjoyed. They do take credit & debit cards but charge you .25cents to use it. You are asked what tip do you want to add which is awkward. We left a cash tip on table. I now understand why this place isn't busy."}
{"text":"Came in the morning since was one of the few things actually open, very friendly, food tasted fresh & was overall really good, will come back!"}
{"text":"I have nothing against dives, as long as they're clean and the food is good. This place was not. The chips were greasy and stale. The food had no seasonings. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Fast and yummy! We were satisfied! The rellenos were excellent and the tacos were also great!"}
{"text":"The food is good, nothing extravagant or mind blowing.  The menudo during the weekends is always on point.  I usually get mine con pan, instead of with tortillas.  Since I've been eating here for so long I always find my self ordering the same items...  all the time.  If it's not a breakfast burrito (ham, egg and beans), then it's menudo.  Sometimes I get crazy and order the chile rellenos plate or camarones rancheros, both rarely disapoint.  The camarones rancheros plate is a shrimp dish that is served with rice and Irma's signature runny beans.  It is served up in spicy red sauce that is \"muy delicioso\" and garnished with lettuce on the side.    The chile rellenos plate is what you would expect chile rellenos to be.  No suprises here, just good sized green chiles stuffed with white cheese and coated with egg.  This plate is served with the typical rice and beans and lettuce on the side."}
{"text":"The menudo is the best! Beans are delicious and the food never changes.   Here are the reasons I didn't give 5 stars.   The restaurant itself is not in very good condition, it's defiantly a dive but overall I don't mind.   They don't actually serve breakfast potatoes they serve French fries. Yes, I know they are both potatoes but it's just weird to me. A Mexican restaurant should serve Mexican style papas for breakfast not French fries.   They only accept cash.   Other than that this place is a regular stop for Sunday morning breakfast!"}
{"text":"I'll take a pass.  The staff at Irma's Mexican Food are warm, friendly, and extremely personable, which is why I feel terrible for calling out their Mexican food as bland, tasteless, and poorly executed.  The food at Irma's isn't so much bad as it is bland, and the presentation is sloppy, even for a fast food establishment. On this visit we had the Beef Tacos and Barbacoa Sopas, all of which border on terrrible. The Barbacoa Sopas were drowned in a tastelesd red sauce with a very small amount of  diced up pieces of meat, and  topped off with a combination of cheese, grease, and more grease. The food could have been worse,  unpleasant flavors would certainly be worse than no flavor at all.  I wasn't expecting fine dining, nor was I expecting terrible Mexican dishes."}
{"text":"(This review is from 2015) The only good thing I've had there is the side cup of green chile. Their red chile burritos have this taste I don't like I can right now only describe as gamey or maybe it was tainted. Idk. Their carne asada burrito is dry and only contains meat (including too much fat) and lettuce. Their carne asada fries are served right on the styrofoam so if you eat them you'll be tasting and ingesting some of that styrofoam. They only come w/ beans, overly stretchy cheese, and too much fat. The restaurant itself has that distinctive old people smell. The lady who attended to me seemed nice though."}
{"text":"Only because the salsa and chips where great. Not fresh!!!! Meat tasted old! I ordered 3 sopes. Carne asada, green chile ( beef ) and barbacoa. The actual sopes on point! The meat however,  not so good. Imagine when you put meat in the fridge to thaw out over night. But the next day you forgot all about it. The weekend rolls around and you open your fridge and you get brutally attacked by the stench of what was. Once a red juicy steak, now dried shriveled brown rotting protein mass. I'm not saying Irma cooked old meat but im pretty sure their lame excuse of carne asada had been cooked and reheated more times then I care to imagine. On a good note my wife liked their hard shredded beef taco. And for that my dearest Irma you get 2 stars.   Ps the sound of the microwave door opening and closing never a good sign. Ill wait the extra 10 min to have pan warmed rice and beans."}
{"text":"Great food! Service could be a little bit better but overall, authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. This place was not good at all. The food was over priced, over cooked, and oily. They claimed to not have chips on the weekend. But they did have them available for Nachos which were bad.  The service was slow despite having a small dining room and 3 servers working. Maybe I should have been drunk or hungover.  Because the folks around us had menudo. In any case their Special was anything but. And $6 for a kids meal with 4 nuggets. Even I wanted the toy. Bottom line is a learned its way better across the street or next door. If you are in the area go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Never found a place that taste like authentic mexican food. I wanted something that taste like home and this place definitely provided that."}
{"text":"Carne asada bland. No flavor whatsoever. Will not be coming back.  Also, wish bathroom was a lot cleaner too."}
{"text":"Will not recommend this place to any of my family and friends living in Tolleson. The food was not good at all. Service was bad, she never came back to refill my coffee cup, which was the only thing I enjoyed."}
{"text":"We have been going to Irma's for over 10 years! They  have truly the best Menudo ever! The meat is cut perfectly and the flavor is always on point!!! The chilaquiles are to die for!!! Their food is authentic and nobody makes beans like them...better than my Nana'a beans!!! Don't get me started on their salsa... it's hot, but delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This is a very plain basic, cafe like place. The food was good, but the kind of food I would make at home for my family, basic Mexican food that is good but nothing special or memorable. The rice I had some of it was hard, same thing goes for my tortilla. Kind of like a bad night of cooking at home... some stuff fails at times. You pay at a counter, which right behind is a microwave where the cook was warming up food.... did I eat last night's left overs? Again the food is decent, more like eating at a tias house when you pull up unexpectedly. I wouldn't say I won't go back but I probably won't."}
