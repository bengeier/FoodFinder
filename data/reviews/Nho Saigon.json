{"text":"Wonderful staff and service. I wish I could say the quality and taste of the food equated to the service. The food was inedible. I tried four dishes. The worst part of it was that we had plastic in our milkshake. They tried really hard by bringing out another milkshake but the second one had larger chunks of plastic in it. They did try and replace what they considered to be better versions of the order we had, but unfortunately it was not good.  Normally I would not pay for a meal like this. I was charged for everything but the dumplings and a milkshake at my request. I paid for their efforts."}
{"text":"I am not sure what is with this place but, I didn't get what I ordered and wanted my money back. The refused to. I will never be back. If you get my order wrong and argue with me about what I wanted and refuse to settle it peacefully, then you don't  deserve my future visits or a positive review."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Vietnamese food I've ever had. I grew up on Vietnamese food and this was so anticlimactic compared to what I usually expect from a bowl of hu tieu. Broth was seasoned weird, was too sweet and honestly lacked any sort of flavour. I don't think anyone in my group finished their order, actually."}
{"text":"Great local pho place in marda loop. Great beef sate and the spring rolls are great too."}
{"text":"Pho soup had a weird sweet aftertaste.  The peanut sate pho had good heat and flavor, a bit on the oily side.   Service was quick and fairly standard for a Vietnamese noodle shop. The meat and noodles used were ok, nothing unique or special.  Price was on par (~$10 per person).   15/30"}
{"text":"Very good quality Vietnamese food and super quick! The service is very good and it's almost laughable that they won't let your glass of water reach the bottom. I've tried a few different things from the menu like the noodles and the curry. Both are super tasty as are pretty much all of the starters. The spring rolls are amaing! Above all, this is quality food and for a low price! I've been here probably 20-30 times and just keep going back."}
{"text":"My wife and daughter love their Pho. Great value too - we fed three adults and four kids last night for $68 - and had leftovers!"}
{"text":"They don't put enough noodles in the soup. So we've started going to other places instead. Too bad because it's so close. Why skimp on noodles of all things ? they cost nothing."}
{"text":"I 've been enjoying this place since Feb 2015 when I found it while waiting for my kid's wisdom teeth to be extracted nearby. Cold and snowy day, tried the beef sate pho with peanuts and BAM! I was in love!  I actually felt so guilty for enjoying this soup so much while my kid was unconscious that, as soon as she could chew again, I brought her here to check it out herself. It's a 20 minute drive from our neighborhood but our family is here at least twice a month for our fix!"}
{"text":"I've gone there a couple of times. It's a nice place with polite and helpful staff. The quality of the food is good with good value. Overall I have had an OK experience and I will definitely go back there."}
{"text":"Fantastic and inexpensive Vietnamese food. It's a small space, family run, and basic but serves up a fast and delicious set of dishes sure to please."}
{"text":"Best peanut sate in the City. Big portions, great quick service. Food came quick. Affordable $10.50"}
{"text":"Coming from SF Bay Area, I am scouting out great vietnamese food at a reasonable price! BINGO.... This place delivers!  A lot of food for a great price.  I order the Bun dish with chicken or beef and shrimp with spring rolls and ice coffee.... A great start to an afternoon... Only been here a week and have been here twice!  Always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite Vietnamese place in Calgary. The dishes are authentic & the staff is friendly. I would definitely recommend eating here."}
{"text":"What the restaurant name was NO (versus Nho), don't come here. The server forgot her smile at home, was rude and didn't give good service at all. The food was okay, nothing special."}
{"text":"I work down the street and stumbled upon Nho Saigon one night when I had to work late and needed to grab a bite. I ordered the chicken sate soup (#17) and have never looked back. I recommend it to absolutely everyone and have never heard anything but positive feedback. I have successfully made addicts out of most of my friends and coworkers. When my husband and I were considering moving out of the city, \"no access to #17 was at the top of the 'Cons' list."}
{"text":"Started with the short ribs which were pretty good, had a bubble tea which was made with caramel ice cream, not good. Had the house special vermicelli bowl and the stir fried curry vermicelli bowl, both were needing a little more flavor. Service was good."}
{"text":"My dining partner asserted that this was the best chicken peanut satay soup he has ever had. Rich and flavourful, not just empty spice. I found the pork dumplings to be good, but the star of my experience was the coconut bubble tea. The pearls were still slightly warm, soft exterior, and just the very centre slightly firm. Quite nice. The liquid clearly had more than a passing association with actual coconut, I could easily sate the richness of a good amount of actual coconut milk. Very nice!"}
{"text":"A solid choice for Vietnamese in Marda Loop. If, the only one.  Nho Saigon has the usual full menu of bun, pho, salad rolls and sandwiches.   Of course there's also Vietnamese coffee and shakes as well.  This is a small restaurant and fills up fast at peak hours so be prepared to wait, however outside of that, you can be seated almost anywhere.  My personal favourite is the sate pho, as they are not shy about using spices here! The salad rolls are also crisp and fresh, with plump shrimp in them. There's also some vegetarian selections as well.   If there's one fault with Nho Saigon, it's cleanliness. This isn't to say the place is a health hazard but on my last visit the synthetic flowers on the tables were stained with previous diner's meals.  That small issue aside, if you're in the area and crave some fresh Vietnamese, hit up Nho Saigon. Just put your flower on another table."}
{"text":"Amazing! My boyfriend and I are regulars here. The food is always good, and the owners are super friendly. I go to a lot of pho places, and this place honestly has the best service. Best peanut sate in Calgary."}
{"text":"My brother & family and my husband I stopped in for dinner here the other night.  Good thing I made reservations since the place is not huge and filled with customers quickly.  We ordered the pho soups with medium rare beef & beef balls in rice noodle.  And several House special Rice Vermicelli bowls as well.  The noodle bowls were quite filling and every mouthful had meat!  Some places you may get huge serving bowls but often not much meat ... just noodles .   This place is located in Marda Loop community and on the corner on the main strip... parking available in the back.  We enjoyed our dinner here."}
{"text":"Rich flavorful sate soup with a broth that is clearly made from scratch not like some of the watered down generic pho broths I have tasted. This place is always busy and has great service!"}
{"text":"I was here for the first time with a friend yesterday.  It has become a new favorite for her and I can see why.  It's cozy with limited seating, therefore it will never be a loud and busy gong show like one Vietnamese place I used to frequent.    I only ordered starter dishes, being spring rolls and prawns, both deep fried.  Apparently I was in the mood for some grease.  The spring rolls were just average but the shrimp was incredible.  They were large and thick with minimal coating.  I brought some shrimp home to my spouse and he was really impressed as well. I'd be more than willing to return to try a noodle bowl.  Glenn M. is right in that your water glass is never empty.  I appreciate that the strip mall in which this is located has free parking, as I was concerned I'd have to pay for Marda Loop street parking."}
{"text":"My friend and I had decided to give Nho Saigon a shot after reading the rave in avenue magazine.  I ordered the sate chicken pho as the magazine had suggested and was quite disappointed. There was a disconnect between how creamy the soup looked and how diluted it actually was, which threw me off slightly. The rave also promised a peanut base soup but there was way too much ground peanut in the soup that it left a bitter after taste after every bite. I didn't actually finish my order, which never usually happens!!   However the price points and serving portion were good. Our server was also very attentive and friendly. Maybe the other dishes are better?"}
{"text":"The service is always fast and friendly, the portions are generous and the food is good quality. It's our favorite spot for a healthy and quick bite!  The shrimp salad rolls are excellent and I always feel full and satiated with any of the soups :)"}
