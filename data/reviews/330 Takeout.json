{"text":"I am a value for dollar buyer. Let's get that out of the way. I also love my sandwiches.  Why I stopped at 330 takeout?  Needed a sandwich on the go, and I had felt pretty good about the last few times I tried it. Not great, but average.  What I didn't like?  The general experience is tied into everything. The service was slow. There was a big order in front of me. I paid almost $12 in tax and had to wait over 10 minutes. When you acknowledge your customer, it usually calms them. Lone behold, I could see your big order was not going smoothly. at one point, the two sandwich chefs left the cutting board. I assume you didn't make it as a line cook.  'It'll be a couple minutes as we are preparing a big order, you cool to wait?\". Absolutely.   Sandwich pros:  I like where you are going with the combinations. Nice bread, slow cooked meat, and some innovative ideas.  Some interesting sauces.  Sandwich cons:  dry bread, dry warm chicken, dry deep fried onions, cheese not melted and little sauce.....!!!  Style and and ingredients mean nothing if you cant put it together to make sandwich harmony!! I've found this with all your sandwiches.  Just b/c you overload it with meat, doesn't make it a great sandwich.   Overall:  Two or more average experiences do not justify your prices. I'd rather spend $5 at subway and customize a sandwich how I want, OR hit the food court where I get the custom sandwich and salad for the price.    Good luck boys."}
{"text":"This place is a disgrace to food. The prices seem affordable at first and then add the overpriced sides.  The chicken which is what  I had  with a \"farrago\" salad was a little over $22. The \"farrago salad\" should be called \"grains floating in grease\" tasted like greasy pebbles interspaced with carrots with a hint of salt and vinegar. The chicken was undercooked and tasteless. Their debit machine defaults  to 18% tip...for a take out.  This I have never seen at a \"take-out\" and I eat out often.  Anyway, if you value your money and hate taking a risk at undercooked chicken, this is place should be avoided at all cost..."}
{"text":"Mercatto's renovations to create this separated outpost of a sandwich/coffee take out joint was a freaking delicious idea. I always thought mercatto's sandwiches at the to-do counter would be tasty whenever I dined in but thought it hassling if I were to just stop by. Note that there's no signage outside which 1) had me really curious after all the construction was done, save for a massive \"330\" decal alongside a pig/chicken/cow chimera decal representing their porchetta, roast chicken, and steak fixed menu. 2) probably limits how much traffic their getting so far as there was no line whatsoever at 1PM or so on a Friday.  The PORCHETTA SANDWICH ($10), or as I like to call it: the never-knew-my-hands-could-be-so-soft sandwich, had juicy slices of porchetta, topped with a sweet honey garlic sauce and a rapini and feta (?) topping sandwiched between foccacia. While I (especially my upper palate) appreciated that the bread was toasted only on the inside, staying soft on the outside, it overall just wasn't structurally sound enough to hold up against the power of pork juice. The beads of juice/fat sweat is ultra enticing as the meat is carved before you but little do you know just how much is retained (in a good way) in the meat when assembled. You see it when it starts to pool a little in the box (itself a brilliant design btw) and definitely as you receive a full hand spa treatment (umm forget paraffin wax). One handed eating is not recommended, but messily doable. I'd ask to have the sandwich cut in half next time but fear how well it'll stay intact if so. Cracklings still have good texture, and I don't recall porchetta & co. sandwiches to have been nearly as juicy (I.e. better bread to filling ratio here). Rapini was cooked soft enough that I wouldn't have been able to discern without seeing what what it was, but the mini bits of feta was a nice high five in each bite.  A sandwich and a drink will probably satiate most for lunch but for this camel, I opted for an additional small side of farro salad ($5). Refreshing with a lemon vinaigrette and diced cucumber and carrot, but nothing particularly mind blowing. Farro is a good choice vs barley which can leave your jaw sore. Caesar salad or roast potatoes are your other options for sides.  Note that they'll still offer mercatto's take out through this joint and have coffee starting in the AM. Barely a few weeks old but fingers crossed a breakfast sandwich menu comes out soontimes."}
{"text":"I saw this place last week for the first time as it's new in place of another restaurant that closed months ago...as I went into the take out, there is a full restaurant...when I first saw this place, I looked at the menu and immediately noticed one item: Porchetta...anyone who knows me know I love my slow roasted pork and I've have it many ways...this porchetta sandwich has rapini (another fav), roasted garlic, a sweet sauce, topped with parmigiana, wrapped in toasted focaccia bun...as I watched the meat being sliced, I kept hoping they would add some of the crackling to the sandwich and, to my delight, they did...I'm sorry, I have eat this very delicious sandwich with greasy fingers as I forgot napkins...wow, the explosion of flavours topped by the crunch of the crackling...I have found my new indulgence."}
{"text":"I just found out about this place and it's the PERFECT location for lunch. They have a variety of sandwiches, but I've only tried the porchetta one. The price is a bit steep, but the sandwich is pretty big. The meat is great and the rapini topping really is a nice touch. You also get your sandwich packed in a super cute yellow container, which I loved. A new must-try spot especially if you work in the area!"}
{"text":"The Porchetta sandwich may be the best sandwich I've ever eaten.  Hits it on all notes... Crispy skin, soft fresh bun that hold together, sweet sauce and bitter greens with the a hint of saltiness... I could have this everyday for the rest of my life and be happy."}
{"text":"You don't expect much from this little takeout place but its a must try. The chicken sandwich is heavenly! Its all about quality over quantity at this place. Its not a meal but an experience. It doesn't get 5 stars because its a bit pricey for just a sandwich. You have to pay an extra $4-5 for a side."}
