{"text":"The Decor is awesome .:.the food is horrid. I had their featured salad which had one grape tomato (cut in half), no olives, three small pieces of cucumber, two pieces of artichoke and more bland lettuce that could cover the plate (some of which were brown and soft).  There were five  people behind the counter and it took them 3 1/2 minutes to wait on us. I brought the salad quality to the managers attention and she said \" oh they prep in the morning it was their fault\". In no way would I return."}
{"text":"Love this new restaurant in town. I grew up on la Madeleine in TX and was so happy to see it come to Charlotte. Their pastries are delicious!"}
{"text":"Our group of four (including two teen boys) loved this place. Every plate was cleaned. We ordered the Country French Breakfast (what makes it French is the potato galette, which is outstanding); a custom omelette, a custom crepe, and the Cinnamon French Toast. (The boys said the blueberries were the best they'd ever had in a restaurant.) Standard coffee and soft drinks are self serve, along with free bread, jam, and butter (the drink and bread stations are very clean and well organized). I opted for the $5 mimosa, and it was great! My own carafe of OJ and a split of champagne. The order is placed cafeteria style, and then the food is delivered to your table, just as at Panera or Amelie's. Prices are reasonable for the quality of the food. ($8.49 for two eggs, 3 strips of bacon, potato galette, a large, delicious croissant, and all the additional bread you want.) I'm glad I took a chance on this place, despite some other Yelp reviews. I loved our experience and I will be going back. We were so full we didn't even pick up any of the gorgeous pastries to go. Next time!"}
{"text":"I've been going to la Madeleine for years. So glad they opened one up by me. I moved from TX several years ago and was craving la Madeleine's authentic pastries. I heard they do catering so I decided to give them a shot. I now order catering from here twice a week for my office and they never let me down. Keep up the good work everyone... I'll see y'all for dinner tonight. The Chicken Crepe is calling my name!!!"}
{"text":"Both times I have been here were great. The French Country breakfast is so good - the croissant and potato gallete - oh my! They have delicious French roast coffee and cafe au lait. They also have a good selection of Bigelow teas and they have a mango iced tea. My party and I enjoyed the tomato soup and Caesar salad the first time we came. The ambiance is very nice as well. It has a French country farmhouse feel complete with a fireplace."}
{"text":"I attended a pre-opening event for charity, so for the sake of full disclosure the meal was free and the staff was still in training. Because of that I'll update my review when I go again after it opens on 12/3. I think if it keeps up this way with the full menu I'll go 5 stars.  The food was delicious and presented well. My table had Quiche Lorraine (which I missed snapping a picture of but it was delicious), a custom crepe, and Crepes Romanoff. The presentation was nice, and the service was also nice. Even though this was a free meal they accommodated a custom order graciously, which says a lot. We shared all of the food so everyone at the table got to try everything ordered. It was all really good but the crust on the quiche was so beautifully crisp and flaky, not the anemic yuck you sometimes see on quiche. For me that was the first wow. We also got croissants before leaving, which were very well made. I had the plain croissant and both taste and texture were spot on.  All in all I can't wait to go again and try it. This place is definitely worth visiting. I'm looking forward to trying the lunch and dinner menus in future visits. I'm also looking forward to trying some of the other breads and pastry."}
{"text":"We would go to La Madeline in Columbia MD when we lived near there.  La Madeline Northlake does not disappointed.  We will come frequently.  New lentil soup is very good."}
{"text":"Epic fail. So I order a sandwich that clearly says it comes with Pesto on it, and instead comes drowned in mayo. So I take it back to the counter, point out the error and they take it back. I hear the manager correcting the staff, who mouths off to him. The manager comes back and says that the fixed sandwich will be right back out. They give me the same sandwich, with all the mayo still on it and a gallon of pink goo which I assume is the tomato Pesto. Not going back again. What a waste."}
{"text":"Yikes.  I ate at this establishment twice and there won't be a third.  With such a french name you'd think french but it's oh so far from that. Food is quite bland in my opinion and the second time both my wife and I had the green apple splatters. Let me also throw in there that the bread had mold. The service was fine though, you get a star for that."}
{"text":"Great food and customer service, it's over in the high B gates but worth the walk if you're flying out of the other gates. The Chicken Parisian sandwich is AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"This place is an over priced cafeteria style place with marginal food at best. I ordered their signature dish Chicked La Madeleine which came to the table barely lukewarm but only because the mushroom slop was hotter than the chicken. The steamed broccoli was obviously the bottom of the frozen bag with lots of tiny florets on my place which was also barely warm. Save your money and time and if you want good French food in the Charlotte area you're better off heading to Amelie's. I'd give this place no stars if that were an option."}
{"text":"I had to give this place a five star. The food and staff are better than any other options you have in the Airport. The only down fall like many of the other establishments in the Airport is the lack of tables for customers to sit. I recommend the Turkey Bristo, pretty good for a Airport sandwich."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and it was so delicious!  The place was amazingly clean and the food was fresh and so good!  We ordered the custom crepes which came with a gruyere sauce and it was fantastic!  Such a convenient place to come for a work lunch.  Great atmosphere!  Will definitely become a staple for us!  Can't wait to go back and try more menu items!  So glad to have a nice spot in this area now for breakfast and lunch!!"}
{"text":"Food was great and fresh for lunch yesterday.  Ambiance is a plus. Got the regular chicken Caesar Salad....delish, & a tomato soup piping hot. Only hiccup is they need to work on line orders....WAAAAAAAY TOO SLOW! !!   #SLOWERTHANACAFETERIA"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the rapid food ordering process, the overall quality of the food, and the quaint atmosphere."}
{"text":"Worst La Madeleine in chain. Crepe was mushy, bread stale, French dip broth tasted like water. The tomato soup and Caesar were good since they are pre made. Staff was overwhelmed. The food runner was very nice and capable. Long wait too"}
{"text":"My friends and I had lunch here. They have a delicate taste with amazing flavor in the food. The service style was great, we enjoyed seeing the food in front of us. I love the deserts especially the fruit tart. The space has good circulation and the employees are very kind."}
{"text":"Avoid this place. I ordered soup and rice. After 15 minutes of no food I went to ask where my food was. They said they were out of soup. When I asked if they were ever going to tell me another guy said what do I want. I said my food and he proceeded to drain the soup dregs into a cup. It only got worse from there. (This is the short version) Finally the manager stepped in to give me a refund, never apologized once, but only gave me the cash for my soup. I then had to point out that they never gave me any food at all! Finally when I went to their corporate website, this location isn't even listed. Which makes me think that mismanagement must be company wide."}
{"text":"I don't expect much from airport food, however, I ordered a breakfast sandwich and it took over 10 minutes to make.  When you have 3 tables to sit at and everyone is standing around, you should be able to do better than 10 minutes for a breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. My chicken provencal rice bowl was delicious but the service wasn't good and I found mold on a slice of bread I was about to eat There was also a lady that ordered before me that didnt get her salad until I left so she demanded a refund."}
{"text":"They used to have outlets of this restaurant around the Phoenix area and I always liked them so I tried this one on a recent trip through Sky Harbor.  Well I was totally annoyed by their service.  Tons of people working there, all incompetent.  They lost my order and when I went up to ask about it they acted like I hadn't ordered anything at all and they would never lose an order.  So i had to pull out my receipt and they still thought i was lying to them even though i had been sitting there waiting forever.  I mean it had been like 30 minutes!!  Only after giving them my receipt did the MANAGER work to put the order together and still one thing was left off and I had to go up and say it wasn't given to me.  Then they asked me to produce the receipt again, really??  After all of that I asked them to refund my money for such screw up and the manager acted like I was trying to steal from them.  I would never go back here again."}
{"text":"I really liked the food, bread and ambience, but I'm not a big fan of the confusing way to order.  You basically tell the hostess what you want to eat as soon as you walk in, wait for it to be entered into a tablet, and then walk down a cafeteria line where you pay at the end of the line.  You pay for baked goods at a separate register, even if you want it with your meal.  The staff was very nice, but need more training."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch at La Madeleine prior to boarding my flight. Had the chicken Friand and got lucky since a fresh, warm batch of chicken Friands were just coming out the kitchen. The food and price was pretty decent by airport standards. They have a number of small tables and chairs. I had my lunch and was able to work on my laptop using the free airport wifi, quite convenient. There are very slim pickings when it comes to restaurants in this terminal (where AA is located), so Madeleine is an ok choice given the situation."}
{"text":"We had lunch after the place is open for two weeks. The ambiance is very nice as we were sitting next to a fireplace. The workers have not perfected the process and they seems to be so hectic. I hope they will be as good as other locations. The Croque Monsieur that I had was just slightly above average. However the French Onion was really good. My friend had the chicken croissant sandwich and he was happy with his choice."}
{"text":"Extremely good airport food.  Highly recommend if you have time and are willing to get something more decent."}
{"text":"Not bad for airport fare, but the best thing about it was the packets of Grey Poupon. Had the French dip and basil pesto pasta salad side. Better choice than the adjacent McDonald's."}
{"text":"The only place to get a beer/wine after 11pm at Sky Harbor airport in Phoenix. Mark was the server great guy. We had a couple of drinks service was excellent. The egg/cheese sandwich was yummy.,"}
{"text":"Staff was courteous and chipper even with the mob of people who had just landed and swarmed their facility."}
{"text":"I'm like Oprah - minus the bank account - I love bread. So naturally I love that I got a croissant with my meal but also could nibble on bread while waiting. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed Le Madeleine at the Houston airport on several occasions.  I was so happy to see them under construction in the old Mimi's spot.  The fresh baked goods are fabulous, the service is warm and lovely and the atmosphere begs you to sit by the fire and relax with your person.  The couple of times we've been has been busy with little clusters of friends or families and it's such a nice little place to run in for a meal or just a fresh baked nosh.  So so so happy to have this gem in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"Just ate lunch here today. We used to love it here. They've apparently switched from counter service to full table service, and seemed very unprepared for it. One waitress was handling the whole restaurant. The hostess was also taking drink orders. The cooks were helping get the food to tables. It was severely understaffed. Customers all around us were complaining, adding to the misery. I don't blame them though. Some were entirely ignored and left. The food isn't what it used to be either. My Croque Monsieur looked like it was microwaved."}
{"text":"We went this morning for breakfast! $38.00 for three adults. Two had French toast with fruit and the edges were hard and the other had the American breakfast. All of it was cold. Walking In Nobody was there to explain  what to do. You had to get your own menu then we didn't know how to place it. We won't be back. Sad cause it wasn't busy either."}
{"text":"I'm always skeptical when a restaurant inside of the airport claims they make the food fresh.. But la Madeleine tasted so delicious and looked like real food you'd whip up in the kitchen. Highly satisfied with my decision. I usually bring my own lunch but I'm glad I forgot today!  PS: try the ham and Swiss cheese melt"}
{"text":"Always been a fan of La Madeleine. Seeing them at the airport was a welcomed sight as they had cheaper prices compared to the other restaurants in the terminals."}
{"text":"I was really excited to see a La Madeleine in CLT. I used to eat there all the time in Dallas, TX. Unfortunately I was very disappointed with the food. I had the chicken friand (one of my La Madeleine favorites). The puff pastry tasted very stale and there was hardly any chicken. What little chicken in there was dry and tasteless. What a letdown."}
{"text":"Place was beautiful. And, the food was delish! Very friendly staff. Great place to meet a friend to catch up."}
{"text":"I had a couple of problems but they were solved. The food was great! I am going to refer friends and family to eat here."}
{"text":"The cordon bleu was extremely delicious, the ham felt fresh as well as the sauce. The presentation itself was remarkably satisfying. The staff is extremely french and everything inside is so pretty. The environment of the restaurant makes me feel like I am actually in France. They have delicious pastries and breakfast all day. The portions are fair for the price."}
{"text":"Excellent french pasteries and breakfast. Croissant sandwiches and french roast coffee. An enthusiast attentive staff. A great way to start a weekend. Hard to wrong with any thing but i like the french country breakfast and the tomato basil soup."}
{"text":"It was all too confusing.   We get in the door and there are people sitting at tables with menus and a hostess. Then when we get to the hostess, she tell us it's cafeteria style and you go up and order and we can sit where ever. Ok, fine. We then go up to order and I try to get something that is on display and they tell me to go order it from the register, like a fast food place.... They had a lot of people working but no one really helping us. I got a little annoyed when they ran out of forks in the dining room and had to wait quite a while before one of the workers realized that I was standing by the registers for a reason.   Food was ok."}
{"text":"On my recent travels through terminal 4, I was delighted to see this slightly better option.  Ah, what a welcomed change!  I ordered a croque-monsieur and ate it there seated... the staff was helpful (the guy managing it was very kind and genuine in helping people decide on something).  The food itself was decent and good enough that I'd probably stop here again when in Terminal 4 to give them my business, especially if i'm looking for 'warm' food that isn't a Big Mac or a Pizza Hut pie."}
{"text":"I don't yelp often at all....I just wanted to let the powers at be know that I eat here at least once a week connecting between flights....usually, it's pretty standard...nothing to write home about.   Today, it was on point! Who ever made my breakfast croissant today(6/26 at 7 AM), keep doing what you're doing! I usually have to adjust the bacon, the egg is all over the place, the croissant is sloppy....but damn, today, it was perfect! Everything was neat and evenly distributed! There was pride in that breakfast! I know, I'm yelping about a breakfast croissant, but I felt it was necessary.   Kitchen hero, have a great week! Manager, look at your work schedule, find out who was working this morning and give that person a high five(at least.)"}
{"text":"First visit....had lunch with Dad...fresh, flavorful, filling. We both had the Duet Magnifique: half or whole sandwich & 2 sides.  I had: French Onion Soup,  Chicken Parisiene, Salt & Pepper Chips.  Dad had: Caesar Salade, French Dip au Caramelized Onions, Potato Soup.   The half sandwich was cut in half and we could only eat half, which is really 1/4th.  The manager, Melvin, was very hospitable.   We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not what we expected but very good. I had quiche and a mimosa. The quiche was very tasty and the portion was huge! And you can never go wrong with a mimosa at brunch. We thought this was a full service sit down restaurant. It is a French infused Panera bread with much better and friendlier service. Some items (eggs, French toast, salads and sandwiches)  are made to order which is also nice."}
{"text":"Brunch with the Hubs. We had been seeing this place for awhile and decided to pop in. Upon walking in you see a lively counter with lots of decant desserts. So you grab a menu and hop in line and and order cold and hot options. Some of the items on the menu need to be ordered at the register. Grab a seat and they bring it out to you.  The crepe was good but nothing to rave about. Crepe seemed to be pre-made earlier, inside was piping hot. I could have done without the cheese sauce on top. Next time will defiantly remove it. Crepe had a herb built it, wasn't really a fan.  Hubby enjoyed omelette which came with a croissant. The bread was light in density.  Would definitely comeback and maybe try some other sandwiches and would defiantly try the desserts they looked wonderful."}
{"text":"Really cool place.  Love the layout and French feel.   Super friendly service. Nice portions for the price.  Great value.   We had breakfast and all tastes great.   We will be back."}
{"text":"Today was my first time grabbing food from La Madeleine. I have previously tired to order take-out from this location but every time I called I was put on hold for so long that I've hung up. This time I decided to place my to-go order online. I ordered the Chicken Salade Croissant with a side of Tomato Basil Pesto Pasta Salade and a Mini Café au lait Crème Brulée for dessert. When I got home and opened my container I noticed they forgot to give me the pasta salade. The container for the pasta was in the box but the container was empty. Needless to say; I was very disappointed. The actual sandwich was OK. Not bad but not great either. I will say that they only reason i'm giving this place 3 stars is because the Mini Café au lait Crème Brulée was DELICIOUS. I will not be going back to get food here but I may be stopping by to pick up a dessert."}
{"text":"This place should not be in an airport. It took 20 minutes to 1 sandwich. The guy in front of me was waiting 20 minutes on plain salad. Another person asked for their money back. They weren't even busy! Do not go here u less you have all day!"}
{"text":"Where to start, my husband and I wanted to grab a small bite at this place. It's roughly after 1 on a Sunday and there's barely anyone in the restaurant. It takes us forever to be seated...not sure if there was staffing issues or not but there was no line in front of us waiting to be seated. We waited at least 7 minutes to just sit down. Finally when we get seated a waitress tells us she is really really busy. Then we just put in drink orders and 10 minutes later she comes back with a single coffee. Not my husbands coffee nor the two glasses of water we ordered. We ask another waitress where my husbands coffee is and she says it's coming. Mind you there are a good 5 people working and not many patrons at all AND the floor was filthy with old food as well as our seat and table. I will NEVER come back to this location as I am thoroughly grossed out and came ready to enjoy one of my favorite restaurants that I haven't been able to go to in a while. I am so glad I left when I did."}
{"text":"Absolutely an embarrassment of an establishment!!  That should be enough.  But I will expand a bit.  The food is bad-gross apple, bad tasting food.  The service is terrible:  the guy at the counter couldn't be more oblivious and rude!  Oh, and they threaten you over refills of your drink because they expect you to pay for refills.  Don't bother unless you have to!"}
{"text":"The logistics of this place are terrible. If you are in a hurry, don't bother. I ordered a croissant and had to wait for 10 minutes! It would have taken anyone 5 seconds to grab it!!!"}
{"text":"Next to American gate 19. Cafe Madeline chicken, mushroom and broccoli bow tie pasta with a light cream sauce made to order with a fresh hot bread stick for $11.50. Tasty and a good value. Nice manager offered me a free drink because they were out of the chicken breast with rice and broccoli that I wanted."}
{"text":"The second good place to eat so far in Phoenix airport. Ordered the turkey bistro with pasta salad for under$10.00. The portion size is deff good for the price. Baguette is nicely toasted and the sandwich did taste really good but I have to say, the side pasta salad is the star. It has the right balance of tartness and creaminess with al dente pasta. It's one of those, I wanna figure out what's in it bec I wanna make it at home kind of pasta salad. I've been at this place twice already and I've ordered the same thing bec it's soooo good. By the way, make sure to finish your meal with a baby lemon tart, that's all I'm going to say."}
{"text":"Are here while waiting for connecting flight. The spinach salad with strawberries, mushroom, walnuts, red pepper, and bacon bits was pretty darn good. The custom omelette where you can choose 3 ingredients was a mediocre."}
{"text":"Always delicious and fresh. Their soups are amazing! And you can't go wrong with any of their pastries!"}
{"text":"Nice little café style restaurant at the airport. This is a great place to grab a hot meal when you are not in the mood for fast food.  I ordered the chicken pesto with grilled chicken. It was bowtie pasta style.  It tasted fine, but there was way too much pesto sauce. It was almost like soup.  However, the meal tasted fine and The staff were fast and friendly. I would go here again when traveling through Phoenix."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for FRESH made food inside the airport!!! Made to order omeletes! REALLLLLY nice counter staff and food runners. Excellent for airport food."}
{"text":"Tasty, Faux European, Fast, Cheap (for terminal food)  Stumbled upon this place because McDonald's had a line and Cowboy Ciao seemed heavy pre-flight. Best deal I've had in a while for a pre-flight meal! Quick at the counter, they have some sandwiches pre made under the heat lamp & quiches too.   I am not a fan of French food, but am always a fan of Faux-European Murican dining. The name croque Monsieur Makes me think I'm getting something fancy when I'm really just eating a ham and cheese sandwich!  The staff is chill too, no rush, no fuss, and fast to give you a cup for water because airport water prices are absurd."}
{"text":"I ordered Chiken La Mandelein thinking it was something else I saw someone eating, but oh my was this plate delicious. It looks and taste better then the picture.  You can't go wrong with this plate."}
{"text":"Well we decided to try this place on the way to pick up a movie. Interesting concept place was very clean employees were extremely friendly and helpful as they navigate us through the ordering process. Food was ok nothing to write home about. This place reminds me of an upscale Cracker Barrel with the fireplace and all.   The folks we talked with all were new to trying this place as well. The overall picture is we probably would not return food did not have that uniqueness that would drive customers to return."}
{"text":"OMG. Stay away. What a cluster. Get your kitchen in order. You're in an airport. You should be able to handle high volume quickly. Waited 20+ minutes and apparently my order \"disappeared\". That just means they probably gave it to someone else! Anyway as soon as I went over to check on my order then they started getting it ready. When I got it, they forgot include my soup so I had to go back. Cool.  I saw people asking for refunds and just walking away because they couldn't wait anymore.   They asked me if I wanted a cookie for my wait. No I want my f'in food and I wanted it 20 minutes ago."}
{"text":"Mark &  Mercedes helped put my day back on track. You could see the positive work environment between the coworkers. It was fun and they kept me laughing! Thank you for being the first positive people in my day!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and great bang for your buck. The big difference for me was the customer service by Ryan Anderson. That employee went above and beyond to help me order the right food. Ryan deserves a promotion!"}
{"text":"This review is based on my first experience. Charming atmosphere. Delicious food. That's the good. Now , the not so good. Confusing ordering process. Staff seemed uninterested. And frankly weren't very friendly. Would I return ? Of course."}
{"text":"First impression was this place is different. Your met at the door by a staff member that explains how things are done there. Then your given a menu to select your entry. Then it's like a cafeteria line where you can pick ready made items or shuffle through to the end and place your order at the register. Which is what we did. You Pay get a cup for your coffee or glass for your drink. Sit down and they will bring out your food. Up to this part it's a fast food, cafeteria and self service restarunt combination. It does work but not a fan. Now the food is another story. That we liked with one exception. The eggs, sausage and French style hash browns were good but the croissant was cold and there were no jellies or butters on the table. You had to ask for them. There was nobody refilling your drink you did that. I rated this establishment lower than it should be due to the style of service not the food because the food was good I just didn't like the procedure to get the food.  But do try it at least once you may feel different."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I feel about this place..overall I really want to like it.. especially the whole French Bistro concept. Much needed in the north lake area. I'm hoping they will change some things and that get ppl to come back.. So here it go!    When I first walked in. I'm greeted by a host.. very friendly. 5 stars.. but it start to go down hill..   It reminded me of my high school cafeteria.. You get in line with a tray and start ordering the food. I have ordered some food to go for my sick friend. Then ordered the paella. After I paid and sat down. I realized I have to get EVERYTHING myself.. Fork, knife, water, bread slices and even napkins.. The Paella was disappointing.. somewhat bland and mushy.. I have to keep getting up because of course I keep forgetting things..  I must have a staff check on me like 4 times to see if I needed something but I felt awkward to ask because I been getting things myself this whole time.. soo no point in having him get stuffs for me..  I just feel like if customer service is that one point than they may as well be our waiter/waitress. I have no problem tipping.. I'm not a fan of going to a high end cafeteria. I can come back for the food if there's food serving but I won't be coming back for food and self serve for the prices I'm paying."}
{"text":"The reviews that call this place weird are right. Their business model is all over the place. The desserts do not taste freshly baked. My guess they are made offsite-reminds me of a hotel breakfast. Definitely NOT worth the money."}
{"text":"Quiche Lorraine and dark roast coffee, what could be more French?  My experience, overall, was positive with friendly staff, warm food, and hot coffee.  I concur that ordering is awkward and if you're looking for a sit down service with waitstaff, this ain't it (c'est pas çe).  My quiche was well prepared and fresh.  The hint of nutmeg found in classic quiche from the northern part of France (Lorraine) was spot on.  I missed, however, the tangy bite of gruyere cheese and onion playing off each other.   While tasty, it was more an eggy custard with diced, sliced ham than the familiar cheesy custard.  The portion size matched it's price at $6.29.  Cannot say I'm excited to return.  Maybe it's because I prefer the genuine thing with all its quirks, trials, and intimacy over a big box copy cat.   Au revoir, Le Madeline."}
{"text":"Food was amazing - had the eggs Benedict and chocolate croissant.  Wow!  Service was excellent and ambiance very quaint.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I have myself to blame for part of this review.  After enjoying one of my top 5 dinners of all time at Monsieur Paul in the French Pavilion of Epcot, I expected authentic French food when we visited La Madeleine during our stopover in Phoenix.    After also visiting France, I have a basic idea of a typical quick lunch in France.  If I order a ham and swiss, I expect a simple ham and swiss with mayo on a baguette, possibly tomatoes if you're lucky.  Well, I was disappointed.  The ham and swiss seemed premade and reheated on a croissant.  There was no evidence of what was in the sandwich on the menu (not even bread) and the lunch rush at an airport does not allow a lot of time to question the menu.  Served with chips, they poured an individual bag of chips onto my plastic plate.  If we're at an aiport, a business should safely assume that this person is on the go.  I would have liked this explained to me so I could opt to just have the bag as it is.  I have also struck out with wine at an airport.  Each white wine I've ordered, including here, was metallic in taste and hard to swallow.  I'm not a wine expert, but I know enough to know that is not good quality for the price paid.  I do not see any reason to try this place again if we find ourselves in the Phoenix airport.  They must have something better."}
{"text":"Reviewing an airport terminal \"restaurant\" is a little strange to me. It's not like yelpers in Phoenix looking for a place for dinner can utilize this review unless they're willing to buy a plane ticket to brave TSA for a meal, and I'm not usually on yelp looking for anyplace to eat at the airport. But like the other reviewer mentioned, this place is worth a good review.    I have a 3 hour layover here in Phoenix and what better way to pass the time but to eat, of course! Although my departing flight is over in Gate D, I wasn't keen on any of the food choices in Gate D so I wandered around Gates A/B/C till I found something. I apologize, I can't remember what Gate this was in. I want to say Gate B. But it was a hefty walk to pass the time during this endless layover. I got the cold balsamic chicken pesto sandwich (which came with a choice of chips or fruit), and the baked spinach pochette. I ate half of the delicious balsamic chicken sandwich before I stopped myself from devouring the entire thing so I could still have room for the spinach pochette. I don't usually go crazy for hearty pastries like this one, but I couldn't help myself. I ate the entire pochette with no shame. Ok maybe a little shame. But I'm a weary traveler. Worth it.   I'm honestly looking a little forward to the rest of my chicken sandwich on the plane, despite my repulsion of the incessant coughing and sneezing in the recycled air that I'll be breathing in as I eat. The deliciousness of the sandwich is somehow worth it.  If you're trying to survive a lengthy layover, browsing yelp just for the sake of passing the time, with hunger pangs starting to knock on your abdomen...I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since they opened. I was SO happy when I heard on the radio they were opening one close to me I could not believe. First time I went to La Madeleine was in NOLA, my father-in-law lives there and they have one in his neighborhood. We go there for breakfast almost every day! Since they opened this one in Charlotte I've been there a few times (not as many I'd like to :) ) The place is very cute, with a French chic decoration, in their restrooms they have French audio \"classes\" which I thought it was interesting.  The place is clean and big so it fits large parties without issues. The staff is well trained and nice. Their options are good and their desserts are divine! I love the fruit tarts and the chocolate parfait , they are my favorites! This time I had a lentils and kale soup, potatoes chips and cheese and ham sandwich. The potato was so delicious with a fresh hint of lime, the soup was pretty good too and my sandwich good, crispy on the outside, warm ham and melted cheese inside. My gas and had the chicken parisiense sandwich (I am not sure I spelled it right) that was great! We also had vanilla fruit parfait, chocolate and lemon tarts. The only downside is that sometimes they keep sandwiches ready to go on the buffet counter and I rather have my sandwich made per order."}
{"text":"Second time visiting. Comfortable environment. Service was fast. Temperature of food is good. Taste fresh; not pre-packaged. Mimosa is EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"La Madeleine is a tweener, somewhere in between fast food and sit down. It is about 1/3rd cheaper in price than Zinc Brasserie, a more sit down French influenced spot in the airport. At La Madeleine, you order and pay at the cashier, take a number and they bring the food out to your table. Fast casual it is.   They have have quiches, soups, salads, breakfast, pasta dishes, beef bourguignon, roasted salmon and dill, croque monsieurs, paninis, spinach pochette, chicken friand, etc.   Country French Breakfast (Eggs any style w/ Potato Galette, Bacon or Sausage, Tomatoes, Croissant) - It came three slices of bacon, two eggs, two cooked circle slices of tomatoes and potato galette, which is a shredded hash brown mixed with some cheese.  The croissant sadly was not warm or crispy on the outside, it was soft all over.  The bacon, eggs, and tomatoes were fine.  I couldn't tell if it was baked or pan fried, but I liked the flavor of the potato galette. It looks like a crab cake, but is potates with cheese, butter and seasonings, cooked to a crisp. The only thing was that the potatoes were very oily and were probably had been sitting pre-cooked under a lamp for a bit.    If you're looking for mind clarifying French food, this is not it. But if you just want something fast that is a step up from fast food, this a decent spot to get a quick bite."}
{"text":"The French onion soup was lack luster coming from a French restaurant. The pastries were good but not great. The place had a lovely feel but I won't be back Due to quality"}
{"text":"The potato soup had very little taste. The Caesar salad tasted like the Dole prepackaged supermarket variety. A great place for people to act cosmopolitan and believe they're eating in France. To me it's an overpriced cafeteria with a French theme. When they greeted me with \"Bonjour\" they lost me. 2 stars = smiling faces and nice and clean."}
{"text":"Been here several  times now and still waiting to be impressed.  First time we went, we both had the sampler and the highlight were the salads. The French Onion Soup I had did not even have onions in it.  Last time was a even worse.  My wife order a Croque Monseiur with a Caesar Salad.  This is a basic Ham and Cheese Sandwich that was very dry and cheese was slightly burnt.  I had the French Dip au Caramelized Onions which is normally one of my favors.  The Roast Beef was dry with little flavor but more flavor that the hot brown water that was suppose to be the au jus.  Even the horseradish was more mayonaise that horseradish so this ended up being one of the least flavorful French Dips I have experienced.  Another large problem was the Coffee.  When we got to the Coffee Urns, they had just run out and had not replaced them with fresh.  We alerted the attendant to that.  15 minutes into our meal, we tried again and they were still empty.  Went to the cashier and asked for the manger who eventually took care of the problem.  The French Cuisine I am familiar with is delicate, moist and very flavorful with a lot of attention to detail and presentation. This Cuisine is not delicate, often dried out and presentation from what I can see, is not even addressed.  It's OK but if you're looking for true French, you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"The restaurant is nice but it's confusing if you've never been there before as there is no host staff or clear signage as to what to do. The food was nice, they didn't understand what eggs scrambled soft meant, as mine were fried hard. The potato cakes were good and the jam. It's definitely not a service oriented restaurant they don't come around and check on you or refill drinks it's more like a nice cafeteria. With that being said I would go again now that I know what to expect but probably not often."}
{"text":"The manager of this location went above and beyond for us.  I'm only sorry I didn't get his name, he gets 5 stars!  He remade my salad without any hesitation (when he saw I didn't want some type of sautéed onion that my husband wanted).  I can only review my Caesar salad and it was pretty normal... Fresh lettuce and veggies so nothing outstanding, but the service was truly  beyond amazing!"}
{"text":"Why does airport food have to be so terrible? Yes, we are trapped like rats, yes we are at your mercy but as a business offering a SERVICE, you should be taking your customers into consideration. Serving a sad excuse for a meal is unacceptable. Serving a sad excuse for a meal with an attitude, even worse. Suffice it to say my \"Spinach Salad\" was a huge disappointment. They basically dumped some spinach in a box with a few surprise bits of strawberry and mushroom (check out my accompanying picture.)  On the upside, this was the last real vegetable I was able to consume ahead of my trip to Mexico. Who knew?!"}
{"text":"Dissapointed experience. Knowing this restaurant just opened in December 2016, I remain optimistic that they'll work through their issues, such as those mentioned in this review.  Came in for a late weekday lunch and ordered a Quiche Lorraine, side Strawberry Spinach salad and cup of potato soup. The salad was freshly prepared and tasty, the soup was good, although it needed to be kept at a slightly higher temperature as it was only warm by the time I got to my table with it. The big dissapointment was the quiche, to say it was overdone is an understatement. The crust was so overbaked, it was a dark brown, dried out, tasteless mess. I scoped out the egg custard mix, hoping to salvage the entree, only to encounter a bland, barely warm filling that left my taste buds grasping for flavor. Fortunately, the size of the side salad was large enough to compensate for the sad quiche experience. Once finished with my meal, I set my eyes on a tasty dessert item I'd chosen from a beautiful dessert display case on my journey through the French inspired cafeteria line. It was a beautiful item called a 'Strawberry Napolean', made up of layers of pastry, filled with lucious cream and strawberries...ah, the anticipation of diving in to this glorious appearing dessert, only to be shocked by the instantaneous taste of spoilt strawberries! Ugh! Fighting the uncontrollable urge to vomit, I politely spit the bite out into my napkin and proceeded back up to the display case/cafeteria counter and catching the attention of an associate, I explained the dessert was spoiled and wanted something else. They were happy to let me pick out something else so I settled on a tasty looking Chocolate Torte. Back at the table, I dug in with my fork only to discover a good flavored but seriously dried out dessert, obviously an item that'd been in the dessert case far longer than it should've been. Needless to say, at this point, I'd lost all appetite for dessert and elected to forgo another replacement.  I'm not a big fan of cafeteria style eating. When I go through the hassle of getting ready to go out for a meal - be it breakfast, lunch or dinner, I prefer to sit down and give my order to a wait person, have my food brought to me, my drinks refilled, my empty dishes taken away. For me, that's all part and parcel of the meal experience and what I pay for, what I tip for. that's not to say I don't occasionally enjoy a family trip to Country Buffet, K&W Cafeteria or a good Dim Sum Chinese buffet but for the most part, I'll take sit down service most times, so I was a bit taken back by the French Cafeteria concept here. Had my meal experience been more positive, I'd be far more likely to return, even if I do have to stand in line like old school lunch lines but I think it'll be a while before we venture here again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, the turkey sandwich with stuffing in a cranberry bred tastes like an entire Thanksgiving meal in every bite. Had the turkey sandwich, French  onion soup, and pasta salad. Similar style to Panera but way better quality, taste, atmosphere, and prices. Paid the same as Panera but with 2 sides."}
{"text":"I've been waiting a year to come here I live in Statesville I'm so disappointed The food was really bad except for the sandwiches My salad was so drenched,all I could taste was the dressing and the lettuce was wilted My quiche was dry and the crust was so hard I had to cut it with a knife So so sad Bring back Mimi's"}
{"text":"QUICK convenient cafe in the Phoenix airport when you've got few options to begin with!!  i like this cafe because i was looking for a salad, and normally airport salads are expensive & limp BUT they had a nice bacon spinach salad w/ strawberries here which was pretty cheap (it's extra if you add chicken)  workers were SUPER nice  NOTE: you can order at the register for a fresh salad OR if you're in a rush, they have pre-made ones in the fridge that you can grab & go"}
{"text":"At night staff is rude and kitchen is closed. Cold sandwiches only that were pre-made. Better than nothing at PHX at night but really a shame."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have eaten here and it was amazing both times. I ordered a French Dip and my wife got the Croque Monsiuer. My sandwich came with a side of their bowtie pasta. The French dip didn't initially look like it would be awesome as the bread was a bit pale-white. But don't be fooled, it was still crusty on the outside and a little doughy in the inside (which may not be for everyone, but I loved it). ALL of the food was outstanding and I wish there was a La Madeleine in Tucson. The service was a little slow, which may be risky if you need to hurry to catch a flight, but if you have time it is so worth it."}
{"text":"I've been twice now and it's still not wowing me like I would like it too. The food is pretty bland and tasteless. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for fun French cuisine. It's kind of like the Cracker Barrel of French food. My latte was sub par.  Stick to Amelie's."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service especially for Asian patrons.  There were three Asian men in front of me, and the cashiers were very rude to them and didn't explain that the sandwiches came with a pasta salad or potato chips.  Those poor men got charged the full price of a meal and only received sandwiches.  I am Asian myself and they tried to do the same thing to me.  Then, my cashier failed to give me a number for my food so they couldn't bring the food to me as they did to their other patrons.  Then, the server gave away my soups to someone else and tried to only give me my sandwich when I paid for two soups and a sandwich that comes with potato chips and a pasta salad.  I pointed this out to the server, and both he and the cashier were unapologetic about getting my order wrong, giving away my soups, and making me wait an extra amount of time for my order.  Totally do NOT recommend this place.  Just go to McDonalds or the country food restaurant next door."}
{"text":"Thank you for being open 24 hours!!!! Food was pretty fresh...friendly, great customer service! Tyra is so sweet! Thank you for your hospitality and going above and beyond!"}
{"text":"I'm usually not very impressed with quick airport food options. Today I was pleasantly surprised. The staff at LA Madeleine was friendly and the chicken salad croissant sandwich was delicious. I'd definitely eat here again if I'm in this terminal."}
{"text":"This rating is only on the take out process not the food for that would receive a solid 5. I have gotten take out 3 times now in the past few weeks and 2/3 times they have forgotten items of the order. The time before was a baguette for my soup which they charged me for. Called to inform and they apologized and would take care of it next time along with coaching the staff. Well today I went in explaining what happened and they took care of the bread but then when I got home I didn't have my Cesar dressing to my salad ... called back for something has got to give - their food is so good. I was speaking to a mgr explaining the situation and the call either dropped (what I'm hoping for) but the timing was like he just hung up on me. Now I'm sitting here with a salad and no dressing. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Even with a brand new McDonalds next door, you can appreciate fine pastries and coffee. The sandwiches are top notch!"}
{"text":"For the most part reviewing airport restaurants is not usually something I consider doing however, I must say I truly enjoy this place! I am in love with the lemon tarts and I make sure to grab a couple every time I fly to PHX a. They have delicious hot sandwiches filled with ham and cheese and mmmm did I forget to mention..... Delicious! I rave to all my friends who travel to PHX about this little cafe and I've never heard of one bad review."}
{"text":"My sister-in-law and I visited Le Madeline for dinner around 6:30. There were two people eating and no one in line. It took a good 5 minutes before the lady working behind the counter acknowledged us. She spoke to me first even though my sil was in front of me. She said, \"Are you getting a salad?\" I told her yes. (No welcome at all). She made my meal, skipping my sil completely and started to ring up my meal even though our order was together and she had not taken my sil's order.   She didn't ask us if we wanted drinks so then we had to buy those separately. We had to bus the table ourselves. The manager(?) came by while we were eating and mentioned they were short-staffed but seriously there was no one there so it couldn't have been too stressful.  After about 15 min my sister-in-law's food had still not arrived when she saw that it was sitting in the pickup window and had to ask for her food. Again, this girl behind the register was doing absolutely nothing.  The food was terrific though! There is so much to like about this place (atmosphere, food, fireplace) but they need to better train their staff or have higher expectations for their employees. From my perspective it seems like a super-easy job (put in an order, ring people up, make a small salad, put precooked quiche on a plate, make a bowl of pre-made soup) but I could be wrong.   I think I will go back and give them another chance but based on other reviews I don't think it was an isolated incident."}
{"text":"The food was good, yet the service was quick,sloppy and unpleasant.  I waited 15 for my food to be handed to me, while I saw my dish being place on the counter 10 minutes prior to the server giving it to me.  She asked if I wanted it to stay before I payed yet she placed it in a bag to take to go.  Also when I opened the bag there was sauce in the bag because apparently the food container had a hole.  You get what you pay for. A $10 dish worth less than $5 $ervice."}
{"text":"First time here and I was less then impressed. The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly; however, the food leaves a lot to be desired. I had the Chicken La Madeleine which was ok. The portion size was very small for $10. The mushroom sauce was a little too salty but the chicken was moist. My sides of broccoli and rice were lukewarm...almost cold. My husband had the Croque Monsieur sandwich, and it was very tasty but his French Onion soup was also lukewarm and not prepared in an authentically French way which is kind of what you would expect at a French restaurant. Overall, the pleasant staff is the reason I gave them 3 stars. The food is overpriced and I don't know what the reason for serving cold food that's supposed to be served hot could be. Not sure we'll go back."}
{"text":"I was a little unsure at first because the menu sounded a little fancy. The food was tasty. Service was quick, and to my surprise for a Sunday morning/ afternoon brunch it was very easy to get a table. You must try the potato galette! On a nice day the patio seating is perfect!"}
{"text":"(more like 2.5 stars)  I'm just going to jump right in and say that the ordering process at La Madeleine is le désordre (a mess). I've watched dozens of people come in utterly confused as to whether or not they should place their order at the counter or walk down the cafeteria-style line.   When you walk in, there's a bakery counter to your left and then the cafeteria-style prep line to your right. However, if there's nobody behind either counter...actually let me re-phrase that, in my experience, there's been at least one person behind the counter but it depends on whether or not they feel like acknowledging you and informing you of how the ordering works. Which is the reason for my gripe: ordering should not be complicated but they seem to secretly enjoy watching people get confused.  On my first visit, I ordered the turkey and brie with salt + pepper chips. The sandwich was delicious and definitely something I would order again. It came out slightly warm and the bread had a nice crunch. I just wasn't a fan of the chips.  On my next visit, I had a craving for soup. Unfortunately, I found out they do not offer a half sandwich/soup combo. The only option they have is a sampler that includes a salad, soup, and sandwich for $10. I did not want all of that food so I decided to just stick with a cup of tomato basil soup and drink (sweet tea). My total for those two items came to $7.23....and my soup didn't even come with a piece of bread! Had I known, I would've ordered the sampler and saved the rest of the food for leftovers. Let my error be your lesson.  Once you order and pay for your food, if you're dining in, you take your tray and number to your table. I do enjoy how cozy they've made the inside feel. There's plenty of seating options so you won't have to worry about waiting for people to eat, pack up and go (like you would at say a Panera).  They also provide actual silverware and glassware. If dining inside, they will give you a glass for your beverage and then you pick up your utensils near the beverage station. If you've ordered a sandwich and/or salad, they will then bring out your food.  I really want la Medeleine to succeed because the food is actually good but the service is lacking which may be due to the new-ness of the place. Next time I come in, I plan on trying out one of the pastries that always look so tempting."}
{"text":"This is much better than Mimi's - if you don't mind the cafeteria style. I had the holiday special and sat by the fireplace. The staff are still learning their roles; apparently I should have received my entree while in line. Instead they gave me a number and I waited 15 minutes before a woman came up to ask if I was ok. She apologized and quickly got my turkey and cranberry pastry / delicious. I think $9.99 for an entree, soup and salad is a great value. I will be back and I'm sure things will improve. They have a complimentary bread station."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our time here. Food is cafeteria style unless your getting brunch, then they bring it out. We sat in the back it was quiet. I highly recommend them for a brunch with loved ones or even a business meeting. I have found out that you can use that back room for private events! They will close the sliding doors and it has a entrance right to that side room from the outside!   There crepes where amazing! I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"It's correct for a airport restaurant. Croque Monsieur was ok, price is not very expensive.  For a good snack"}
{"text":"As I was waiting to board my plane at terminal 4 of sky harbor airport this location and its visual menu looked too good to pass up! A deli cafe kind of place seemed fit for my short flight. I honestly don't recall the name of the plate I had but this sandwich was toasted with cheese on top and in the inside cooked ham with more cheese! I love me some cheese so how could I go wrong...  The meal also included some red sauce now pasta. The pasta was also delicious with fresh tomato flavors. The unsweetened mango ice tea complimented the meal very well! Too bad this location doesn't have a stand alone place outside the airport. Maybe in the future ...."}
{"text":"Nice little cafe with variety of options from salad to sandwichs and pastas. LJ was very helpful and very nice service in regards to suggesting sandwiches  YUMMMMM. Definitely way better than McDonalds next door!"}
{"text":"Tried this new place in town for the first time tonight, and needless to say no one in my family left disappointed. I got the Pesto chicken sandwich with a caesar salad and it was phenomenal. Although the service took a little bit to put out more complimentary bread, it did not hurt the overall experience at the restaurant (I say this knowing the place recently opened and is still working out the kinks). When the bread did come out, it was a fantastic compliment to our already delicious food. They have strawberry, and blackberry jams set out for the bread, which were absolutely fantastic. Overall the food was very fresh and tasty. The price won't clean out your wallet, and it is something different you don't have everyday. With its slightly out of the way location, this place has to be good to keeps its doors open and it is. I hope to see it strive"}
{"text":"If you dont have the time to go to France, this is a great place to experience french cuisine at a reasonable price. The food is exquisite and there are so many options to choose from! The owner is really nice, he tells funny jokes and the staff is always friendly and willing to help. If youre spending the day in North Lake, I would say this is the best restaurant around!"}
{"text":"When my two sisters and I visited this location on Wednesday, December 14th it was open for about two weeks. One of my sisters has been to several locations throughout the United States and suffice to say this location fell short of what she's experienced. The food was lackluster and she bought two bakery items which were cookies and they were rock solid. She complained and then they return back with a new set of cookies that were microwaved which were not freshly baked that they claimed they were but honestly were not. One other thing I noted who are the dirty utensils I finally gave up after searching through several forks and knives and spoons to find a decent one. I asked the cashier if I could get some plasticware. The restaurant as a whole was very clean. I don't plan to come back bc this place did not impress me much."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped to have lunch at La Madeline and this location was so clean the service was five star.  And the workers were so inviting.  I felt welcomed. No doubt will always eat here."}
{"text":"I asked for a quiche Loraine but was told they were out. I ordered the quiche florentine instead. Tasteless!  When you find your fork, knife and napkin, grab some salt and pepper!  I was disappointed as the unhealthy McDonalds next door smelled so much better!"}
{"text":"It's an airport location so expect a line and chaos. Customers don't know where the line is so at times its a free for all to place an order. Most of the sandwich selections are pre-made and under a hot light. I only stop by to purchase cookies and pastries after hitting a different spot for actual food a guy can admit to eating. There were a couple college girls today sitting around with berets on their heads looking silly. I guess if you want to be Frenchie this is the only place in the airport to do it. I have never ordered more than desserts so I cannot talk about the food. My delectables are always great but way more than I wish I'd spent."}
{"text":"Only had pre-made sandwiches and salads at 9:45pm. Both were expensive for the size (as expected in the airport I guess). Although it looked fresh, when I opened it the bottom half of the sandwich croissant was completely soggy and gross. The salad was OK until we found a hair in it. We ended up getting our money back. This place is disgusting and I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"What was once 'Mimi's', which mysteriously burned down and then pops up 'la Madeleines' ( within the same family of restaurants), also carries a similar menu. This is a self-serve ordering line-up and a get your own coffee. Not a fan of this place as the food did not appear freshly cooked, but more like stand-by pre-processed food items down to the small fruit bowl.... if that's what you want to call that! I was incredibly NOT impressed with the entire process and the meal itself, and felt like a greatly wasted my $$. Oh well, you live and you learn..... but, never again."}
{"text":"Mom and I visited today, opening day, for lunch. The restaurant is beautiful. The food is beautiful. The staff was enthusiastic and well trained. Can't wait to meet Mom there next Monday! I'm so tickled to have a French Patisserie so close to home. Very nice! You order, kind of cafeteria-style and there didn't appear to be any tipping. You are handed a menu as you enter. Many beautiful rooms of seating and a beautiful fire place! It wasn't on at lunch time. My only complaint."}
{"text":"Picked this spot hoping for a quick bite between meals.  Looked to be slower than the McDonald's but quicker than the Cowboys restaurant each flanking this place in the Spartan B terminal (higher number gates).  Instead of being just right, this turned into a 20 minute wait for a quiche and salad leaving me stressed and a little mad. The last thing one needs at the airport after a mile walk from the upper gates of terminal A is slow service when u were trying to be good and not eat junky fast food.  I now have to grab it to go and try to figure out how to eat this on a plane!"}
{"text":"If u want fresh desert and bakery this is the place for you. If you want cafeteria style fast breakfast this is the place for you. If you are looking for a inexpensive breakfast and enough food to fill you up this is NOT the place to come to. The inside when you walk in is very confusing layout. They have a nice fireplace inside. For the amount of food you get it is pricey. It's a nice place to try once but not a regular breakfast or brunch place for me."}
{"text":"This place is good to grab a quick sandwich, but as a bakery, their food lacks. My Apple turnover was sahara desert dry, crumbled in my hand, had flavorless layers of pastry crust, and very little Apple."}
{"text":"What the Hell happened??? I first visited La  Madeline for Thanksgiving to score pastries for Thanksgiving dessert. I was given 5 Xtra free pastries bcuz I arrived at 7:30 pm the Wednesday nite before Thanksgiving. I only saw one elderly couple seated and dining, but that's understandable!! It's Thanksgiving Eve!! I visited again in December to purchase fresh baquettes. They were wonderful!! Crispy and fresh outside and soft and chewy inside. I told my sister about it and she got hooked in their huge oatmeal raisin pecan cookies and the ham & cheese  pastries. She actually went back more often than me, during December and January. Today(February 20,2018) we attempted to visit for a late lunch. We approach the door and see a sign that reads \"This location is permanently closed.\" WTH??? This place had awesome pastries and bakery items and nominal business whenever I visited!! They had the most business on the weekends for breakfast and brunch. I don't understand!!! Why do the good businesses always fall down the rabbit hole??? If anyone knows why this business folded, pls respond on Yelp. Thanks."}
{"text":"Meh. Fast casual but nothing French about it except maybe the attempt at a croque monsieur. Too bad. Was hoping for something interesting.   Suggestion to owners - Cut your menu in half, make it traditionally (or approaching) French, and careful on lunch prices and you might have something."}
{"text":"Ambitious name but nothing really draws you besides that - no atmosphere, unique drinks or food and a far cry from what you'd get in Paris airport so no excuse for being \"airport food!\""}
{"text":"Very cool! I actually read the reviews above me and got discouraged to almost not come in.....just because you have to read a little and follow direcrions doesn't deserve reviews like that. But I am glad I decided to ignore those reviews and come in anyways.  The food was delicious. I had the \"make your own crepe\"!! So good!! Love crepes!! However, I will say a little more movement, involvement and excitment from the staff would probably be more helpful than not, when they see someone at the door looking around. Even someone walking up to the glass to order was being ignored. I wanted to stand up and be like \"say hey to the customer, can i help you with the ordering process!!\" Don't worry tho, the lady just started ordering hahahaha. So, overall MY experience was great, so if your someone reading this after those crazy reviews above me....dont listen to them....\"cafeteria style\" really down grades this place a bit. It's kinda like that...but alot nicer!!! And the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"They're pasta's are really good. They have so much flavor and the baguette that comes with it tasted fresh and warm. The GM Melvin was very welcoming. I am really happy with the service that we received. I would totally come back again."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. The first time it was crowded. I ordered breakfast and my food came out cold. This time no wait, ordered breakfast and the food was Luke warm and not worth $40 for 2 people. They also forgot to give me a potato galette, even after I reminded them. When we went through the line to get our utensils, they were out of forks and had plastic forks in place of the real ones. I had to stop the manager and ask for a fork. You guys can do better than this. You need someone that knows how to place people and keep the food line moving so orders are promptly picked up and customers receive \"hot\" food. This is my last time coming here. I will gladly drive 35 minutes to Cafe Monte in South Park! You get great customer service and the food is amazing. I came to you because I wanted to patronize our local businesses. I am completely disappointed."}
{"text":"Just average and not all that french. Ordered french onion soup and no melted cheese just sprinkled some grated cheese whoch then a large clump of cheese on the bottom of the bowl.  The tomato bisque looked good may try this place again after it has been open longer."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place to grab a quick lunch before flying home from Phoenix.  Decided to get a massive spinach salad for $8.11 to get some greens in.  They have a lot of other French options like quiche and stuff that looked a bit heavier and would take longer to prepare, so I didn't go for those.  Just grabbed my to-go salad from the fridge case.  Spinach, mushrooms, roasted pecans, bacon, red bell pepper, and strawberries in a balsamic vinaigrette...  my meal did hit the spot for some much-needed micronutrients after a week of heavy meat and starch gluttony.  But I had dumped my entire container of dressing over my salad, and it was a bit thick and heavy, so I think I had overdressed my salad.  Probably half of it would have been sufficient, oops.  But a good meal with seating area right next to the gate, so I hope it was a healthier meal option than McDonald's before my flight."}
{"text":"Ordered breakfast. Beside belong expensive for a place where you order at the cash register, the food was cold. Bacon, omlette, French toast, eggs over easy, all cold.  Staff was nice hence salvaging their rating."}
{"text":"I have to say I didn't have a bad experience here during my short layover at PHX. After reading some other reviews, I just wanted to point out that this location is located in an airport. If your expectations are authentic French cuisine or food just like it would be in Paris, please just don't. I'm pretty sure you wouldn't find any 5-star meal at any airport.   I ordered the omelette plate which came with a HUGE croissant (decent). My food did take a bit long to come out (~5-10min), but I realized it was because they actually made my omelette with fresh ingredients. I love mushrooms and was surprised that they used huge slices of mushrooms instead of sad little cubes of mushrooms I usually find elsewhere. The spinach was fresh as well.  For $8.56 (tax included), I got so much more food than other airport restaurants would give at the same price. If you're worried about having to wait too long after ordering to eat there, just grab a sandwich or salad. They looked pretty filling to me. Overall, this place is great for decent airport food quality and really good for quantity. They don't skimp out on amount of food. Come here if you're looking for something that won't be too disappointing!"}
{"text":"We waited for half an hour and the food was not ready yet. Then after 45 minutes, the server came out to check and let us know that they did not put the order through in their system. Totally a bad experience. Avoid this place if you could."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian; got the pesto-tomato-mozz sandwich with side pasta salad (also pesto-y). Very good. Better than my lunch at the Four Seasons the day before! Yay for airport food upgrades. Agree with others that there was a very friendly guy working there who seemed to think he was working in a real restaurant. :)  Wish I'd picked up a yummy looking pastry too. Next time I'm at terminal 4 in PHX..."}
{"text":"Maybe I got there at a bad time.  Ordered turkey and provolone on sourdough.  Roll was bland, didn't seem fully cooked. Very little taste to sandwich. Service seemed slow but it was lunch.  Ate less than half the sandwich.  Recommend other alternatives."}
{"text":"We ordered via Postmates. Everything was packaged nicely. I ordered Pasta la Madeleine. The serving size was good. The chicken was thin sliced and extremely tender. The pasta and sauce was tasty and creamy yet not heavy at all. The tomatoes and broccoli added a nice lightness. It really was a perfect spring pasta dish. I added a little salt and pepper because I like a lot of seasoning, but it wasn't needed if you prefer a lighter taste.   My son got the Provençal  Chicken and Rice Bowl and said it was the best chicken he's had in a long time. He really liked the flavor.  We also got a piece of lemon cake and it was very yummy."}
{"text":"Great food that's not greasy, and friendly service! Nice to grab a real meal at an airport..."}
{"text":"Excellent food and outstanding service. You can get Crepes any way you like. Traditional French pastries. Great coffee! All excellent. Serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"We had a quick bite here before boarding our flight to London. I seriously picked this place because a.It had a fancy parisian name. b.They have a nice area where you can sit and work for a bit. c.It was a little less crowded than the other places.  The menu is mostly croissants,baguettes,sandwiches,salads,soup and the likes of it. We got the Chicken salad croissant which is a cold sandwich and the chicken parisian sandwich (grilled chicken,tomatoes,bacon,lettuce).The food took a good 10-15 minutes to get to the table but made up in taste. I wouldn't recommend ordering the sandwiches if you need to rush but a lot of the stuff is freshly made so i would say they are doing a good job as far as airport food goes.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"The SLOWEST service for a sandwich I've ever experienced. And it wasn't even that good. No manager came to apologize or try to make it right either.  Bottom line: there is better food and far better service in this area."}
{"text":"I could've sworn I already reviewed them... Anyways, here goes. I generally like this place. Always wonderful to have something that's completely new to the area also conveniently also located very close to home.  Inside it can be a bit confusing. I came on Grand Opening weekend and it was expectedly packed. There were naturally lots of staff on hand to explain how they operate. It was definitely needed - the service locations are a bit divided. It makes sense when you start to understand what they make and sell though. Directly in front of the entrance is a glass-faced display cooler with lots of French-inspired sweets (think Amelie's if you've ever been). Not all the highest quality, but lots of choices. Beside that is a register if you want to skip the line. To the right of the sweets begins a tray line where you can go down and tell them what kind of salad you want or pick a few kept-warm items off the hot plate. At the end of that a few more registers. If you don't want anything off the hot plate or a salad then you just skip the line right to the registers and get something made to order. This is a very confusing layout for first timers and returning guests alike. I'm not a fan.  Service, otherwise, is on point. They try to keep it as French as possible. They greet you with \"bonjour!\" and in the bathrooms you can even learn a little French while European (get it? \"ur a'peein!\"). The background music is very stereotypically old-movie French accordion and vocals. And the interior décor is, in my opinion, excellent. It's a very relaxed and easygoing atmosphere!  Prices are on par with chain restaurants in the surrounding area. Food quality is not bad. Sometimes the items that get left out too long start to taste like it. My favorite dish is the Mediterranean Paella. It's a yellow (saffron?) rice with diced veggies and shrimp that is only made to order so there's a bit of wait time in there. It is very filling yet light in calories and arguably still healthy. The salad options here are also quite good with darker greens, nuts and cranberries as well as proteins available. I'm sure to come back in the future for more paella at the least and have breakfast here on my list too."}
{"text":"It's too bad this location closed in Phoenix, but it's still at Sky Harbor Airport. This is my favorite place to eat at the airport. The sandwiches, salads and pasta are delicious. The wait time is quick even when It is busy. They do have some sweets like fruit tarts but those are usually a hit or miss for me as far as freshness (again this location is in an airport and isn't the same as a free standing location)."}
{"text":"Had the pesto Alfredo pasta. I needed to add a little bit of salt (I add salt to everything to bring out the flavor ). I also got the iced mocha which was really good. Total came out to $15.50- a little pricey."}
{"text":"Customer service was good but food was sub par- it's airport food, I KNOW but it's a French style bistro w out bastardized version of French food. All I wanted was some tasty French onion soup- all I got was onion soup. Luckily it was replaced w tomato basil soon thereafter. Also had the pasta la Madeleine- the chicken tasted sour and whoever is putting the decorations on the food dumped WAY too much parsley and tomatoes on top. It just looked like they didn't care. I didn't eat that much- if I wanted tabbouleh I would go to a Mediterranean place. Not sayin that airport food is good, but I expect more out of la Madeleine. Guess I was wrong to do so"}
{"text":"My friend and I had a really great time. The food was delicious and service was great. Definitely coming back again. Angelina was really helpful in the bakery, she helped us satisfy your sweet tooth. She also cashed us with a great smile."}
{"text":"Overall: Small slightly-expensive breakfast spot with a touch of faux-French. Nothing extra ordinary, but you are at an airport.  Menu: Lot of options for food, and faux-French items. I had their Breakfast Croissant. It was fairly big and delicious but also $8.  Price: Expect to pay airport rates  Service: Food comes in to-go containers. Coffee is fairly good."}
{"text":"Pretty hard to beat for an airport. Affordable, great food, excellent service from counter girls who care!!"}
{"text":"Sorry the scrambled eggs were horrible. Bacon very bad also... it looks like they have a kitchen in the back but this food was mass produced somewhere else. You are better off going next door to McDonald's....  The staff was friendly though."}
{"text":"Definitely a disappointment compared to other delicious dining options in this airport. Had the spinach salad and it was haphazardly thrown together--old strawberries, weird grilled chicken (it had been over marinated) and a strange flavor combo. I honestly just ate it because I had to rush to my flight.   What's weird, it seemed a general manager was there overseeing operations with the local manager. As I sat down, I was shocked to see dirty tables, a dirty floor, a HUGE puddle of water (that I pointed out to them) and mostly indifferent staff. If this is how they act while the BOSS is here, how is it when he is gone?"}
{"text":"Nice decor and design inside.  The resturant gives you a very cozy feeling when you walk in.  All of the waitstaff are pleasant and super friendly. Ordering seemed a little chaotic. There are things in the line readily avaliable and some things that are not that have to be made to order.  But since the cashier is at the end you either have to have great memory or tote the menu as well as trying to balance the heavy glass of anything you got off the bar.  Also the pastries are at the beginning of the line so you have to order them separately.  They were slow cleaning off tables also. I firmly belive they should at least have someone around offering to fill your drinks-that was the most irritating aspect.  The glasses are small so if you are thirsty prepare to spend your time walking back and forth. This took away from our experience. Its reminds me of K&W and Amelie's having a baby-but atleast K&W will fill your drinks so you can enjoy your meal vs walking back and forth. Maybe invest in larger cups to accommodate. The food was pretty good and fresh.  I liked that they had other types of fruit available for the fruit salad instead of only the run of the mill cantelope and honey dew melon that most places serve."}
{"text":"Food could have been a little hotter. Good lunch spot. Quick. Good price point.  Would go back but not regularly."}
{"text":"This rating is almost entirely based on the lack of customer service we experienced here.  My friend and I came in on a Wednesday night about 6:30. There were very few patrons in the restaurant, but 5 employees behind the service line. We walked up to the line and stood there waiting for one of them to greet us or ask what we wanted.  All five of them were restlessly moving around a little (like you do when there is nothing to do and you feel like you should be doing something but you really dont have anything to do), but not one would make eye contact with us - and we are literally standing right in front of them looking at them. A couple of them said a few words to their co-workers, but no one spoke to us. After a while, it was so comical, my friend and I looked at each other and just started laughing (like wtf?). I guess they were playing chicken with each other because finally one of them broke down and asked me what I would like. I repeated my order 3 times (it was just a salad) before she finished the very very slow process of putting the 4 ingredient salad on a plate. I slid my tray down to the cash register and then, despite the fact that there were still multiple employees hovering, had to wait until the same person who made my salad finished with my friend's meal before she slowly walked down and rang up my salad. One young woman then gave us a cheery \"Bon Appetite!\" I jumped because it startled me.  The salad was meh. My friend's salad was a goopy mess with what had to be 2/3 c of cranberries on top of it (she left most of it).  My friend had to walk back to the counter for something and when she returned to the table she said she had asked why everyone was standing around like that when we walked in and was told that they were waiting for their shift to be over. So I guess if you hate your job so much that the chance of waiting on a customer might mean you have to stay one minute past your shift, better to just stall until it's time to leave. I think that explains why the we were finally waited on - she must have been the one who started her shift at 6:30...I dont know, just a guess.  The same cheery woman who wished us well came by the table as we were leaving. I wasnt sure if we were supposed to bus ourselves or that was for her to do, she said she would do it, but not in the way that made me feel like it was right for me to leave it. I couldn't see where to take it though, so let her pick things up. Being a new restaurant and a relatively new concept for people a good customer service tip might be to tell patrons as they go through the line where to pick up utensils, etc and instructions about whether or not someone will bus the table when finished.  Parking was easy and plentiful. Should continue to be so if they dont step up their game."}
{"text":"I have a sick addiction.  It's S&M, but for my taste buds.  Why I constantly subject myself to airport food is unfathomable.    I should have gone with something simple, which generally is safe at airports, but I opted for the French Dip sandwich.  The main draw of the sandwich is the horseradish mayo - this condiment (if one chooses to categorize it amongst the common ketchups and mustard) is my weak spot.  Much to my dismay, it was slathered with regular mayo.  I returned it and they were nice enough to prepare a new one for me.  Kudos for that.  But the sandwich wasn't even great, despite the horseradish mayo.  Chips were a little stale too.  And it was expensive at like $12-13 bucks.  Y'all can try the other meals they have ... just don't get the French Dip!  dmo out"}
{"text":"I had a 2 hour layover at B22 so I decided to eat. I ordered a turkey and provolone sandwich on ciatbatta bread from the open refrigerator area and upon checkout, the very nice team member offered to make it fresh and toast even toasted it. I would have eaten it cold as it looked delicious already. He also made my pesto pasta fresh as well! This was my first time ever eating at this restaurant and I will definitely go back to one near my home. All of the staff were friendly, efficient and short waiting for time for fresh food! Every single one of them had smiles on their faces and great attitudes. LJ, because of your immpeciable service, I will be back! My only suggestion is to allow tip when paying. I didn't have any cash."}
{"text":"Food is fairly good, service is good.  It isn't gormet cuisine but better than your average fair.  Probably a visit every few months; not a routine dining establishment."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love going here for brunch. They have the best quiche Lorraine around town. The employees are very friendly. Speed has been hit or miss. We've waited anywhere from 5 mins to 15 mins to get our food. We usually spend about $25 for two people."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, rounded up to 4.  What's with the lack of love for this place?  I visited Le Madeleine for a late lunch one day.  They are located in Mimi's former location, following the fire several years ago.  However, unlike Mimi's, Le Madeleine is more of a fast-casual place, rather than a sit-down restaurant.   Having never been before, I needed some time to decide, and the staff were very patient and helpful.  I selected a quiche lorraine, a creme brûlée, and a water, all for $10.  I think that is pretty reasonable for this caliber of food.    The quiche was precooked and heated so it could be served quickly.  Regardless of the reheating, I thought it was delicious.  The creme brûlée was served cold so the topping wasn't really crusty, but it was still delicious.    The dining area is very cozy and comfortable.  Nicer than a Panera, and certainly better than any fast food joint.    I like that Le Madeleine has many options for meals, including samplers and made to order crepes.  This place beats any of the food court options in the mall, and is worth the drive across the street."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Reed.  This place does take airport food, & make the \"airport\" go away.  We had a significantly above mediocre experience --and it was stellar for airport dining.  Not only were the employees very nice.  But our food was good, and we actually enjoyed our experience.  And believe me, we were grumpy because our nonstop flight somehow transformed into an undetermined delay in Phoenix that we were NOT planning on.  Having an nice place to dine at the airport, while we waited in frustration was very comforting.  I was able to order an omelette to my liking, sans any gluten or milk products, and my travel companion enjoyed a really delicious looking pasta."}
{"text":"The Phoenix airport's dining options seem to be getting better, at least since I last visited in 2012. I remember reading at the time that the airport was making a concerted effort to bring in better cuisine. An airport location of La Madeleine Country French Cafe is a start. It opened in 2013 in Terminal B, sandwiched between a McDonald's and Cowboy Ciao (Scottsdale-based American restaurant and bar). These restaurants are all relatively new (or renovated) with open, fenced-in, dining areas along the concourse. All of these build-outs look good with nice modern designs.  On a recent pass-through, La Madeleine looked most appealing to me for a quick meal. The restaurant has an upfront ordering system where you wait for food to be brought out to you or your table. There are glass display cases with ready-made foods such as baguettes, yogurt, cakes, and French pastries. A large window behind the ordering counter allows you to see inside the kitchen. The tables are small and the dining area resembles that of a French street cafe. The staff wears French chef uniforms and berets.  The restaurant serves breakfast (eggs, bacon, oatmeal, omelettes), soups, salads, sandwiches (hot and cold), quiche, and chicken and pasta entrees. Prices are reasonable, especially for an airport restaurant, with no single item costing more than $9.99.  If you're dining on-site, your order is brought to your table on/in disposable plates/bowls. If you're dining off-site, your order is securely packaged in sturdy disposable plastic containers and comes in a bag with handles. Practical and convenient. I saw multiple passengers on my flight leaving Phoenix who brought meals on-board packed by La Madeleine.  Drinks (fountain drinks), napkins, plastic cutlery, and condiments are self-serve at a station next to the ordering counter.  I ordered a Quiche Lorraine ($5.89) and one of the Soups of the Day, the Tomato Basil ($3.99). The other Soup of the Day was French Onion. The Quiche Lorraine comes with ham, bacon, and Swiss cheese. They've also got a Quiche Florentine which comes with egg, spinach, and Swiss cheese.  The quiche have already been prepared and are reheated for new orders. They're served in plastic containers with clear, snap-shut lids. My Quiche Lorraine was OK, though it wasn't heated properly. I ate immediately after it was served and it was unappetizingly lukewarm. I think it would have been much better if it was hot. It reminded me of the frozen quiche I've gotten at Costco before. So it wasn't a very fresh or super tasty quiche. However, for airport food, it was satisfactory.  The Tomato Basil soup was good, though the portion size seemed a bit small. The soup was flavorful, creamy, and a little thick (I didn't mind). I'd definitely order it again.  Service was superb. The on-duty manager took my order at the register and also served the food to me. I saw him assist another custom with finding (and cleaning) an open table."}
{"text":"This place is perfect to do brunch with a group of friends or to have a mini brunch with the family. Their pastries are so good."}
{"text":"Despite the other tepid reviews, I had one of the best gastronomic experience at an airport here. I ordered chicken friand with crispy, delicate layers of crunch with a scrumptious sauce. Who knew an airport in the middle of the dessert would have french food. A fruit tart is the perfect dessert I'm saving for the flight."}
{"text":"Tasty creamy tomato basil soup. Pretty fast service. Nice staff. Great place for a quick eat. More vegetarian options than McDonald's so that's a big plus."}
{"text":"The food here is consistently good. Hot items are hot and cold items are cold. I haven't had a bad dish yet (except for the soup -- skip the soups). I think of this place as a French version of Panera. (PS. Panera has a much better French Onion Soup). Great for lunch!"}
{"text":"I have gotten lunch to go from here 6 times. My first experience was in April 2017. Food was surprisingly great though the service was mediocre. It never fails, EVERY visit, an item on my order is forgotten or the order taker creates it wrong. I've overlooked the poor service for the tasty food. My visit today puts an end to ordering there again. Arrived at 10:50 AM to avoid the lunch crowd. 2 other people in the place who are dining in. The girl taking my order was new and in training. She was being trained by another girl who boasted she had been working there 2 MONTHS. After repeating my order more than 2 times, I paid (using La Madeline's app).  After waiting 20 minutes, I inquired to the 2 monther in regard to my food. At that point she decides she'll attend to it. AFTER 30 MINUTES my to go order (2 half sandwiches and salads) was ready. We went through the order as she packed it. She assured me nothing was forgotten. Well upon getting back to the office, they completely forgot the BACON on the Blt! Needless to say, I won't be returning  The food isn't worth the wait or the hassle."}
{"text":"This place confuses me a little bit. It was sort of a chaotic mess when we arrived. When you walk in, you are supposed to grab a menu and then go through the line to place your order. Well, there were no menus, and we were told to order at the hostess station and then pay at the end of the line. It was just a little confusing as to how the flow was supposed to go.   The food took FOREVER.  A lady even came around and stated they thought we already got our food and she would bring it out.   I got the turkey and brie sandwich and it was ok. The sweet tea is excellent. The French onion soup was pretty good too. Overall not a bad experience, just a little unorganized."}
{"text":"My experience was similar to Carolyn L. I loved the fireplace and the host was very helpful. However the quality of the food was average or below and the staff (other than the host) seemed uninterested, uninformed and ill at ease.  I am resourceful and soon figured out that other than having the food delivered to the table, I had to get everything....I even had to search for a glass for my beverage.  I wanted to sit down and enjoy a nice lunch. Instead, I left without having had a pleasant experience and probably won't return."}
{"text":"I couldn't have been more thoroughly impressed by the service and incredible food for this place. I had this ham and cheese melt with cheese on the sourdough bread, a mini fruit tart and hot chocolate. I liked the service the kid gave me so much that I gave him a tip"}
{"text":"Friendly service and nice atmosphere.  Those are about the only compliments that I can give this place.  I ordered a Croque Monsieur (warm sandwich) and a side salad, while my wife had the eggs benedict and my son had french toast with blueberries.   My Croque Monsieur was not a traditional Croque Monsieur - very little sauce, way too much ham, very disappointing.  My wife's eggs benedict had two small eggs that were folded over and they were not poached properly - they were not runny at all.  We paid $5 for one piece of french toast and about 8 blueberries for my son - way overpriced for what we got, and the syrup was closer to corn syrup than anything else.  The only saving grace is that everyone checked on us regularly to see if we needed anything and everyone was friendly. However, they need much more direction for ordering.   I got my sandwich immediately and my wife and son had to wait for 10 minutes or so before receiving their food.  I don't like that the food was served at separate times.  There were also two lines and confusing signs, so ordering wasn't intuitive.    Also, the Americanized \"French\" food only seemed to be French in the name, but not in the execution.  Do not go here if you are expecting actual French food.  This place does to French food what Olive Garden did to Italian food, but at least with Olive Garden ordering is not confusing and you get your food at the same time.    I won't be back."}
{"text":"Glorified cafeteria. Interior was very clean and inviting. If you go, order the Sampler. Your choice of three items, in smaller than normal size. I had Onion Soup (it was just OK), Quiche Florentine (so, so) and Caesar Salad (freshly made but little taste)."}
{"text":"For airport food... they were ok to good depending on your mood.  Why I decided to give them a 4 star review was due to the freshness of the ingredients, but mainly due to their customer service.  Most airport workers you encounter have a \"mundane\" attitude about them since they see so many people on a daily basis... and I could only imagine that about half of those interactions aren't very pleasant due to the weariness of traveling.  However, this quaint little airport joint in Phoenix put a smile on our faces when they greeted us in French prior to getting our breakfast order."}
{"text":"Located near terminal B20. Recommend Apple turnover"}
{"text":"Great fresh made breakfast and the staff is super friendly. I was accidentally overcharged for my meal (no biggy) and they offered to wipe my table in the middle of me already eating. Other than that no complaints!"}
{"text":"So it came down to a choice between McDonalds and this place with a french ass name and pictures of croissants everywhere.   Since ive eliminated fast food from my life completely after graduating from college I figure i'd take a risk and try some breakfast here.   The menu is pretty extensive but I decided upon an omelet- with ham cheese and spinach wary that it would be the cheap eggs that terrible restaurants use.   I however was pleasantly surprised when I got my meal- it came with a rather large croissant and a huge 3 egg omelet that had great flavor and hit the spot.  The service here was good and attentive and also kept the french façade going when the told me to bon apetit.   The only 2 knocks on this place is the lack of refills on soda (1 dollar refills) and lack of hash brown or other side with an omelet.   Ill be back should I have some downtime at Sky Harbor"}
{"text":"Met my family there for lunch. Cafeteria style with hand prepared items made to order. Fairly fast with the lunch crowd, waited maybe 15 minutes to get through the line. Lovely restaurant, very open easy access. Food was quite good and reasonable."}
{"text":"The breakfast quiche and the croissants are really quite fine here. The chocolate and almond croissant is off the hook! This place takes \"airport food\" and makes the the \"airport\" part go away. Good food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Friand and quiche have a delicious pastry shell. Soups were tasty though the French onion was a bit tepid. Staff was friendly and the fireplace was a nice touch.   Have to take one star because they are a chain. (Vivre le propriétaire)"}
{"text":"Not bad for airport food. We ate the croque monsier and it was just ok, a little on the bland side. We ate the fruit tart which was very good. Customer service was awesome, the gentleman brought out our food with a sincere smile. And fast service."}
{"text":"I know it's the airport. I know it's the middle of the night. But the cinnamon scone I ordered was extremely dry (aka stale), bordering on inedible. Only my imagination, piecing together in my mind what it might have tasted like early this morning (or yesterday), boosts the rating to two stars. That and the sense of humor of the friendly cashier who knows even less French than I do."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot. Atmosphere was nice and friendly as well as the service. There were a many options to try samples with the combo choice. Food was warm and tasty. I will return."}
{"text":"Meh. Ordered something that was a puff pastry with chicken in it and came with a mushroom gravy. It was fairly salty and I had to scrape off most of it. Dining area with tables are really crowded and hard to navigate with too many tables and not enough room as people with luggage juggled food and not tripping over suitcases.  Conveniently located across from bathrooms and a nice sitting area with tabletop charging stations."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Sandra is very sweet and accommodating. A great place to stop for a quick and stress-free lunch. Want to say this is better than some of the stand-alone La Madeleines I've visited before."}
{"text":"The food is very good. you order similar to a cafeteria and some of the menu items are prepared had the time of order. The only thing is if you get one of the hot items from the line by the time you get through the line pay and get your drink the item is luke warm or cold. Other than that there are no complaints whatsoever. Great place to eat"}
{"text":"Take Panera and the old style cafeteria and give it a French flare and there you have it.  A couple of things you need to know about La Madeleine.  1.  They are a chain out of Dallas, but not public traded on the market.  Just in case you love and want to invest.  2.  There is an audio of French language lessons in the restrooms.  I seriously felt like I was back in high school.  3.  There is free bread with fresh jam and butter.  4.  The ordering is cafeteria style.  5.  They serve breakfast food all day long.  6.  They cater.  7.  The French Onion soup is the bomb.  8.  The Quiche Lorraine was very fresh and very very yummy.  9.  They have soup, salad, sandwiches, omelets, french toast, croissants, muffins and more.  10.  They great you with Bon Jour.  Like for real.  11.  Prices are between $4.00 and $14.00.  Very affordable.  I think that sums up everything.  Check it out."}
{"text":"After taking a red eye to Wisconsin last week, I made a pit stop in Arizona before reaching my destination in Milwaukee.  Upon landing at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in the morning, I was starving..........and decided to walk around the airport to forge for some morning grindz.   After walking around long enough, I decided on trying this place called - La Madeleine Country French Cafe.  The main reason why I came here was that there was no long lines (as the other places appeared to be a lot busier).  I ended up ordering the French Breakfast & a coffee - which came out to $11.24.   What was in the French Breakfast? I got a croissant, bacon, eggs, a tomato slice, & this potato hash thing with some crap in it. (sorry gang, don't know what that was).  What can I say about this place..........well, airport food is airport food. I knew exactly what I was gonna get so I really didn't have too much high expectations, and all I can say is..........to have something to eat, is better than having nothing at all.   Coming here, don't expect that you will be sitting in a French Cafe............or having elegant French food! It just another fast food place with a fancy name........that's all I have to say about that.   Coffee wasn't too good either..........I guess I should have gone to Starbucks instead. Le sigh...........Lol!"}
{"text":"The chicken was tasty however the portion was extremely dmall and when i mentioned it to the counter agent she agreed but no offer to do anything about it. The coffee was gas station quality."}
{"text":"I've never reviewed an airport restaurant before, probably because my expectations are extremely low anyway. However, LM at gate B21 definitely stands out. I was bummed after I missed my morning flight but decided to make the best of it and get a decent sit down breakfast. I'm not a huge fan of LM simply because the service and food have always been mediocre wherever I go and the food it extremely high calorie. But I wanted breakfast and I'm in an airport so I rolled the dice. Great choice. The service was friendly and prompt. The food was phenomenal. I had the American breakfast  and it was a lot of food for about $8. The eggs were perfect and the bacon crisp. The croissant was not super fresh but still very good. The cappuccino was not great at all--save your money or bring your own. The seating area is small, so busy times will be challenging. Worth the walk if you have the time."}
{"text":"Wow! Cannot say enough kind things about the experience we had yesterday at La Madeleine! We reserved a private room for my baby shower and they catered it for us! The staff was extremely friendly and food was delicious! Thank you so much for making everything go smoothly!"}
{"text":"I ordered the \"potato soup\"... it didn't have ANY potatoes. Just some chunks of thin and overly cooked bacon. The soup didn't even taste remotely good. Wasted $7."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their soups are amazing as are their quiche and their desserts. Staff are always friendly and provide great customer service. The only downside is that it can get pretty expensive for the amount you're getting."}
{"text":"When eating here, you look at a menu then order at a register and walk down a line to pick out other items. If youve never been there before, that was kind of confusing because there were no more menus at the door (needed to be put back by the staff). Then it was sort of a cluster EFF when our food was delivered, none of the staff knew who ordered what and were walking around having a hard time finding people. Then we got each meal 1 at a time, im sure im not the only one who likes to eat at the same time as the others in my party.. and especially difficult if you have hungey kids.   The staff were fairly nice and food was pretty good so I would give this place another try."}
{"text":"Best new restaurant. So happy they just opened up across from the mall. I will be a regular for sure !! The chicken la madeleine was amazingggggg"}
