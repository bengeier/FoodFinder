{"text":"The flier we received said, \"A NEW UPSCALE AMERICAN TAVERN IN LAKE LAS VEGAS\". 
So to break it down, yes it's new. Yes, it is in Lake Las Vegas. And that's where it begins to fall apart. 
A tavern as opposed to a bar is supposed to be inviting, warm, and a place you want to hang out with friends. This place is none of those things. From the insufficient staff who acted like we were doing her a favor by being there to the metal chairs reminiscent of well, cold hard metal chairs.... 
The food was mediocre at best, the drinks were pricey and ice filled to capacity. 
Needless to say, we will not be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Tough rating as we live in the area and want restaurants to succeed here but this place was not good.  The service girl (dark skin with a strange name) was horrific and spent 80% of our time there staring at the computer with a confused look on her face, then brought us the wrong bill in the end.  It's a little more than odd that the hostess bar is in the back, so we walked in the front door and stood there for several minutes confused what to do or where to check in.  No sign, no hello.  Basic menu that was generally edible at best.

In summary, bad service, wrong bill, poor design, limited menu, below to average food.  They need to step it up if they want to stay alive. - Scott"}
{"text":"Great fresh food with a lot of flavor. Specialty drinks were on point. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Plenty of tv's to watch sports and the only gambling in lake Las Vegas area! Can't wait to come back and try the breakfast menu"}
{"text":"Sunday 7/2 was Lake Las Vegas Independent celebration. Went to Proof around 8pm. Several tables open inside and outside. Was told there would be a 30-45 minute wait. All the other restaurants that were open had people waiting in line. Proof only had about a handful of people waiting but we all left when w were old about the wait. Couldn't believe it seeing there were so many tables open. Management needs to do something."}
{"text":"Weak service, beer on tap was two things: warm and stale. Tell your sales rep to check his codes, or do it yourself. Oh and maybe come back and check on your customers once in a while. Thanks for nothing, will not be returning."}
{"text":"We came for breakfast with our dogs.  They were very dog friendly, brought the dogs water and a few slices of bacon.  Service was great and the food was delicious!  I had the breakfast burrito ana my husband had the three egg breakfast. Both were great!"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful and well designed. Additionally  the food is out standing we had the edamame and pork belly appetizer s and they were both delicious. For the main course we had a Hawaiian flat bread pizza and a chicken Sammy which were both equally delicious. Reasonable prices as well. Can't wait to come back soon"}
{"text":"First week open so thought we'd give it a try. Pleasant staff. About 5 tables occupied plus some people at the bar. Ordered burgers. Took almost 40 minutes for them to arrive. They were dry and tasteless. No spices or flavors added. Up charge for truffle fries - did not taste like truffle oil, we're lukewarm and a very small portion on the plate. Auld Dubliner across the street has better food that comes hot and fast to your table. Hope they work he bugs out as we need some more dining choices here. Staff were pleasant and attentive. Kitchen needs some supervision!"}
{"text":"Went in & the sign said \"please seat yourself\" we did and no employee was in sight we looked around sat down and waited for around 5 -8 minutes finally I got up to look around again and the waitress had been sitting at the bar hugged up on a male customer laughing and giggling  the whole time we thought she was a drunk customer  !   
Aside from her acting as if she was a customer on a date : 
She didn't even acknowledge us & we sat right across from her and the boy toy & her appearance (tank top cut off shorts and wearing sunglasses indoors) we would have never know she was employed there 
when we got up to look around she says \"oh yeah so party of 3 right?\" 
Too late we took our business elsewhere"}
{"text":"The food is very simple atmosphere is fun service just okay. Location is a fun place to be. Great people watching place."}
{"text":"The absolute worst service!!  Waited an hour and a half just to get water. The manager was worthless, he just walks around not acknowledging anyone.  The waitress were incompetent to even put an order in.  Do not go to this place. Absolutely horrible!!"}
{"text":"The best thing about my experience at Proof was the free WiFi... and the live band outside.

My party of 6 waited for over 20 minutes to get our drinks and then another 45+ minutes to get the food we ordered.

The drinks were either in warm glasses with lukewarm beer; improperly mixed with alcohol and mixers/ bitters; or the wrong drink altogether.

Our food was not much better. We ordered chili, sandwiches, prime rib and a flatbread. Sides were undercooked, the Reuben was barely warm along with the prime rib and bbq wings.

The staff, of 3 (1 bartender, 1 waitress and 1 manager) was insufficient for a busy Friday night at a restaurant with a live band and everything slowed due to that. We will not be visiting this location again after this experience and would recommend any look elsewhere or be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"Nice place in beautiful Lake Las Vegas.  Good atmosphere, great service, but our food was bland."}
{"text":"As a Lake Las Vegas area resident, received a coupon in the mail for buy an appetizer, get one free. Also, read about this new place in the Next Door neighborhood app where some of my neighbors recommended it. Others, were pretty critical saying the service was subpar and to let them work through the new restaurant kinks. 

One review that stood out to me was a neighbor saying that they're dog friendly on the patio. I called ahead to verify and they sure are! Took the 2 puppies with us and enjoyed some dining on their patio. 

We got the edamame and wings for appetizers. Both were tasty. We only ordered one entree which was the skirt steak salad. Also tasty. 

The place has beautiful decor from what I could see on the patio, looking inside. I never made it in since I had the dogs but my family all used the restroom and confirmed that it was very nice inside. 

I found the service to be good- On par with what I expect at a bar/tavern. Again the food was good. 

I am excited for this new place in our neighborhood. Will definitely be going back again and hope to try some other things on the menu. Hopefully will find that one menu item I find to be 'great!' and will keep me coming back even more frequently! 

Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Shrimp appetizer was good (but not crispy) and the chili sauce was very flavorful. I requested the fish & chips as main course. Fish was crispy and ok. Tartar sauce was thin and unremarkable, no lemon provided. Fries were horrible, almost bleached white color and tasteless. Plenty of food at reasonable prices. Salt on the table is larger granular type in a but regular shaker not effective when trying to season your food. Service was excellent plus drinks were refilled before empty.  Will try this place again and hope they serve fries for grown-ups next time I go!"}
{"text":"I never really knew this place was here, mainly because I don't get out to Lake Las Vegas as much as I would like but a friend and I went here when we realized to our dismay that the Auld Dubliner was closed :(.  So we sauntered over and had a few cocktails and beers on the beautiful patio.  The cocktails were good and the bartender was very friendly and inviting.  I don't know her name but she is from Chicago and with the relaxing patio atmosphere, made our night.  I would definitely go back here again for drinks and may try food at some point."}
{"text":"Great food, had the Proof burger with fries. The burger was cook exactly how I wanted and the fries were hot. Love how many beers they have on tap. Sunday's is get 1/2 off burger great deal."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. There were about 3 other tables with guests and a few openly at the bar watching football.

What I liked: drinks were good except for my friend's Long Island iced tea that was all ice and no drink. 
Food was decent but not spectacular. 

Dislikes: they have one half-booth available and uncomfortable metal chairs for the tables. Slow service! One person working tables and it wasn't even crowded. It took about 10 minutes to put in drink orders. Our server seemed to have attitude and we knew we were in trouble when she didn't write down our orders, which had some modifications - repeated 3x! So of course food came out wrong and had to be sent back. They were out of Tator toys which we were all going to order.  Delivery of drinks took way to long for a bar not that crowded. 

Our appetizer took a good 20 minutes to come out... for some cheese dip? 

We were all parched about 10 minutes after eating which indicated that food was way over salted. 

Probably won't go back. Disappointed because we had high hopes.

Update: gave this place one more chance.... servers are still rude and slow. We sat down and waited 15 minutes for menus and a drink order... and nothing. There were only 4 other tables and one paid the bill while we were still sitting there. We got up and left. Seems like all of the action is at the bar along with the servers.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Lake Las Vegas in a while it's time to revisit. I absolutely love going there. You don't even feel like you are in Las Vegas. Have a couple more new restaurants. They also have a couple art galleries and I love when they have the lights around the trees. It's so awesome just to walk around especially during the fall and winter holidays. They definitely give it this throwback to the days of when everybody just hung out and there was never any issues. It's just beautiful there. We went for dinner and ate at proof Tavern. My wife and daughter both got salads and I ordered the fried brussel sprouts and sweet potato fries. The place is very clean and contemporary. It has outdoor seating and never seems to be that crowded where you have to wait. The staff that I met were very friendly and attentive to us. Our food arrived and of course we started to dig in. Now I know brussel sprouts does not sound like something amazing for others but these were off the hook good. My daughter was completely raving about her Caesar salad dressing. Even my wife was excited about her Cobb salad. Not sure why it was all so much better than somewhere else but it was. The brussel sprouts were a lemon pepper type of brussel sprout and they had an spicy aioli for it. I gobbled those right up and they give you a big bowl full. There sweet potato fries are hands down my favorite. I think it's time for all of you to just go visit Lake Las Vegas stop at proof Tavern and maybe grab some apps and beers or stay for dinner and even maybe gamble a little bit. Then take your time and walk around that place make it a date night and maybe go to the Chocolate Factory or grab some ice cream or anything make it a day it's awesome. Great job proof Tavern!"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday for a late lunch with a friend and to my surprise, the place was pretty empty. We walked in and were told that we could seat ourselves at any table we liked. There is a full bar on the left with video gaming and a separate area for dining on the right. We sat at a table close to the windows and were quickly greeted by our server. I didn't catch her name, but she was friendly. She brought us our drinks right away and then asked us if we were ready to order although we had just sat down. I told her that we needed a few more minutes to look over the menu and I honestly just felt a little rushed, so when she came back for the last time to finally take our order, I quickly chose something.

The menu is small, to the point, and everything is decently priced. I ordered the Club Wrap with sweet potato fries and my girlfriend ordered the Hawaiian Flatbread. I asked our server what kind of onions were in the wrap because I'm a little picky when it comes to onions and she had said that they were green onions. Sure enough, when our food came to the table, the onions were in fact red! I love red onions and I'm not complaining, but I think it's important that the staff know the ins and outs of the menu in case a guest like myself has a question.

Our food was good and the decor is beautiful. I loved the dark color scheme and light fixtures. It gives Proof a very modern feel. I'd probably give this place another try in the future after they've been open a little longer. The breakfast menu looks great!

P.S. A million TVs in this place and not ONE has the playoffs on? What kind of madness is this!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. One waitress on Football Sunday. Took 45min for drinks & appetizers."}
{"text":"Would not recommend the pork butt app...looked bad on the plate, taste was just ok.  Corn dogs are always fun! Homemade chips were ok. Burger was just ok. Not a place for food, just get drinks at happy hour!  :)"}
{"text":"If there was zero I would give it that.

Visually the place looks nice but service was trash. 

Waited an hour for a breakfast burrito and a chicken Sammie. Not once did the server come up and apologize for the wait or even fill our water or coffee. 

I was so thirsty even after my food came that I had to fill my own glass, my server watched me and said nothing.

Two thumbs down."}
{"text":"First time here. Nothing quite impressive from food to service. Only good thing is happy hour buy one get one app and low price drinks. Avoid order fried Brussels sprouts!! Horrible! It's like a bowl of deep fried leafs. 2 stars for heavy poured drinks."}
{"text":"This place has wonderful customer service from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. They were always very attentive. The food was okay I had a flat bread pizza which was too flat, but the edamame made up for it since it was so good! My friend has the skewers and she felt they were dry."}
{"text":"Food was good.late night eats. Coleslaw salad which they serve on the side  was freaking good."}
{"text":"The food was great and the prices weren't too expensive, but the service is what killed it. The girl serving us was newer so I want to cut her a bit of slack but it really made our visit unenjoyable. 

My friends and I decided to come here because they gave 50% for military members. When I asked the server about the 50% off, she specifically said everything was 50% off. Alright, sweet! 

I believe we were the only table that the girl had, but she went missed for periods of time. One couple in our party ordered additional food, but it never made it out until we asked about it. By that time, we wanted to cancel it but it was too late. 

At the end of our meal, the bill came out and everything was incorrectly charged. We had come in during happy hour but everything was normal price. So we had to ask her to change it to happy hour prices. She also keyed in drinks/ appetizers that we did not order so we had to ask her to change it to the correct items. 

When I got my check, the 50% off was only applied to a few items instead of ALL items like she said at the beginning. When I asked her why only certain items had 50% off, she said she made a mistake and it was only certain items. While this is not the end of the world, it was a bit annoying to be told one thing and then charged more at the end because she made a mistake. 

I think this place has a lot of potential, but the owner should make sure that all the staff members are properly trained before being out on the floor by themselves."}
{"text":"We had such a great time at this new place in Lake Las Vegas! The service was great and the food was amazing! The skirt steak salad and hummus were my favorites. My husband loved the ribs and the homemade chips. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had lunch at Proof today and it was a great time! The food was great and the service was quick. I loved the classic rock music and someone at the bar hit a five hundred dollar jackpot! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was exceptional! Jennifer was our server and could not have been better. We will definitely be back soon. 5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"If I could leave 0 stars for this restaurant I would. After waiting 30 minutes for a waitress to take our drink order, we had to walk from our table in the restaurant to the bar to order drinks. The bartender got our drinks no problem and we walked them back to our table. After waiting 40 minutes for the waitress to take our food order, I asked her if we could please order. She responded to me with an attitude about how busy she was and that she told us in the beginning we would have to wait 40 minutes because there was 8 tables in front of us.  However that was not the case, all they said when we walked in is that there was a 10 minute wait and they were busy. She also never apologized for the wait. Finally she took our order. We waited 30 more minutes for our food, only to have food come out for other tables who came in after us. They brought random drinks to our table that weren't ours, only for the waitress to respond that they were on the house. We were pretty sure these drinks belonged to another table where people had already left. We asked the manager if we could please get our food as we had been waiting in the restaurant for 1 hour and 45 minutes. He apologized and said sure right away. 5 minutes later he proceeded to bring out food for another table that had sat down after us. At that point, 1 hour and 50 minutes of waiting we finally left. I would have rather eaten at McDonald's over this place. Do not go to Proof Tavern, it is awful."}
{"text":"We had had a party of 6. We received terrible service. Food was below average. Pricing was okay. Some of us were finished without meal before others were even served. They were not busy but would not split out tab and then ended up charging one of our people the full amount of the bill."}
{"text":"Had a great time. Loved the Band The Rum Runners 6pm to 10pm. Love the Pineapple Margarita next time less ice please, Angus Sliders and sweet potatoe fries. Can't wait to go again next time the band is there. My Friends and I are coming save our table"}
{"text":"Restaurant and pub located in the Lake Las Vegas area.

The Lake Las Vegas area is like a ghost town after 9:00pm especially on a week night. Even restaurants that claimed to be open later shut down early. We were lucky to find Proof at 9:30 on a Wednesday night. The kitchen was still open as well.

The restaurant had a large bar area with video gaming at each barstool. There was a separate seating area for dining.

The food menu was small but had some good selections. To start I had the pineapple margarita which was delicious. For an appetizer I had the corn dog bites which were yummy. For my dinner I had the fish and chips which were also good.

Good food and good service."}
{"text":"I like Proof.  I've visited three times in the past two weeks so maybe I more than like it.  The first day that I came in I met Makayla, a bartender/manager at the restaurant.  She's really personable and helped me to pass the time as I waited to get the go ahead from my realtor that I could move into out new home.  She is the reason why I've come back again.

I've eaten a lot of the food from the menu due to my frequent visits.  Twice I've had the Cesar salad.  It comes with large croutons that seem to be cut from baguettes.  That's fun.  I think they could go a little easier on the dressing though, but I'm sure others would beg to differ as I know plenty of people like lots of salad dressing.  It's still tasty obviously or I wouldn't have ordered it again.

I also had the clam chowder (loaded with clams) and the meatful chili.  If you love beef, definitely get the chili as it's true to the name.  My husband ordered this and loved it.  I had it a few days ago and found it too heavy but I have been meat free for  close to a year and only started back eating it this past month.  

I also tried their grilled chicken salad with tater tots and that was yummy too.  There isn't anything that wasn't good, my palate just needs some work right now. 

I'm most impressed with their beer selection.  First of all this is because I (thought) that I hated beer.  That was until Makayla suggested an Austrian grapefruit beer to me and I fell in love.  I'm glad that I broke out of my comfort zone and tried something new.  I now want to go so I can try my luck on the video poker and enjoy a refreshing Stiegl and some good conversation with the staff."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have had great experiences. Shaina, the night time bartender, is awesome. She's friendly and quick! The few items I've tried from the menu have been great. Glad this place is in Lake Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Really good Happy Hour, specials on the weekend too. Great Angus Beef Burger. Salad with home made Blue Cheese as a side option. I just discovered my new favorite white wine here too!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! The Sammie was bomb!!! And my sissy who is vegetarian loved the veggie wrap! Jennifer was so nice and attentive!"}
{"text":"Upon walking through the ghost town of Lake Las Vegas Hilton you will find this friendly modern restaurant. They have a tv, seating area, bar and bathrooms in the back. 

See pics for menu selection! 

Typical restaurant brunch food but done very well, as were the drinks 

I just really liked the laid back atmosphere and the fact it wasn't crowded or noisy. That's what you get when you go to a resort  

I would come here again, I want to try their dinner."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? First off there was a staff of four. The place was popping good crowd, but the staff was unprepared. We waited a total of 1:45 to only get one serving of water. I ordered drinks from the waitress but never received them. After going to the bar where multiple drinks were on back order i finally received my beer and wine from the manager with multiple excuses. 
Lake las vegas has a reputation of being a ghost town during normal hours and thats because of crappy places like this. I would rate this place a 5/100 because they gave me 2 free beers for the wait which i believed were given to us because ppl were walking out. 
After finally drawing a line at 1 hour 50 minutes to receive our appetizer we decided to walk out. The service was the absolute worst in the business. It was like an episode of bar rescue but there was no one to shut the place down after falling so far behind. If i was a manager here i would resign because they obviously have no idea how  much food industry works in Las he Vegas. I hope this review is a warning to future customers to avoid this place because it is absolute trash."}
{"text":"Ordered the Margherita and BBQ chicken flatbreads from the Happy Hour menu plus the Buffalo chicken sliders with tater tots from the regular menu. Everything was delicious! Good beer and a great atmosphere. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The food was great and the selection of beer on tap was awesome. Great place to hangout in the afternoon. The live music was amazing."}
{"text":"Although the crowds were not swarming- this place was awesome! Happy hour deals were great- and delicious! Live music was set up on the patio. I wish Lake Las Vegas Village was more hopping to ensure this great set of staff members continued success."}
{"text":"First time checking this place out tonight- not very impressed.  
I ordered the skirt steak salad- very disappointing. The greens were sad.  I was unsure if the steak was actually meat as it was quite an unusual texture. I couldn't even eat the salad.

The sweet potato fries were hot crispy and tasty.

My husband ordered clam chowder which he enjoyed.  But the sliders were fair at best.

The mixed drinks were good.

Probably will not be returning, especially paying $60+ for this dinner which I couldn't even eat and came home hungry..."}
{"text":"Went to their grand opening today and the food and service was great! I read some of their reviews on here and keep in mind this place is new and were still testing the waters. I got fast service and food was on point. I def recommend this place! Plus from what I know it's the only place there that offers gaming which is a plus."}
{"text":"This is a great bar with a multitude of HD televisions and great food as well.   The bartenders are all very helpful.   The selections of beer on draft is way above average.   The selection has a slew of microbrews."}
{"text":"I had to check out this new place at the Lake, so off I went on their 4th day open, a Sunday. The menu online seemed impressive, and I anticipated that it would be busy. The bar area was busier than the dining area. I signed up for their player's card which comes with a promo of $10 play after earning 20 points. Service is friendly and the decor is very nice. They have gaming at the bar and more machines behind the bar, closer to the dining area. 

I've tried a few different menu items, the Proof burger and the eggplant parmigiana. I had a salad with the burger, which was an awesome side of mixed greens. The eggplant was pretty good also. The draft selection is fairly average, with 3 local brews- Big Dogs Tailwagger Wheat and Crafthaus Resinate IPA and Evocation. The mixed drinks/martinis are very good, and my fave is the Proof Sour. So tasty!  A patio provides a great area for enjoying a bevvie outside. 
Since opening, they're had some food/beverage daily specials, which are posted on a board at the entrance or on Facebook. 

After visiting a few times for their weekday gaming promo (earn 20 points get $20 play), they had some issues with the promos working correctly. I hate when that happens! After that promo ended, I wasn't informed of the new promo until I asked if the old one was no longer valid. They didn't have many players the times I've been there, all the more reason to inform them of any promotions. I will continue to visit Proof because I support new businesses at the Lake."}
