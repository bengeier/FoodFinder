{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would. Today was my first time ordering from here, my co-worker and myself ordered breakfast......BAD IDEA!!!!
First of all it took and hour to get our food, Second I had an omelet with turkey bacon, mushrooms and onion with cheese, this was not an omelet it was a fried egg with the ingredients thrown inside, bacon wasn't done, and my red velvet waffle was a waffle with red food coloring, one of my co-workers didn't even receive her order and when I called them they said oh we were out of what she wanted ......REALLY!  NEVER EVER AGAIN WILL I ORDER FOOD FROM THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The only reason why I gave this place one star is because I was just belittled, degraded and called a BITCH by their delivery driver. Grey Chevy Equinox with 30 day tags.  I am going to spread ALL over social media what this black man just said to me...a black female. I wonder if he disrespects his mother like that or if he has daughters... does he call his daughters BITCH...Oh Mr delivery driver, if someone someone called your daughter that how would you feel? Didn't think I watched where you drove into did you? I have eaten from yhis place many times but NEVER AGAIN due to this employee. In the end, watch what you say because you'll never kniw when it'll turn around and BITE you.  I am a professional BLACK WOMAN AND ALSO A QUEEN. Please employ nicer people Hungry Hut."}
