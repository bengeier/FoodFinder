{"text":"Been here a few times at the Baby Point location and have been pretty happy with everything. That said, I'm a huge fan of Brooklyn style pizza (Grimaldi's, Lombardi's, Ray's, etc...) and the closest thing in this city to that is North of Brooklyn. But since they only do takeout, QM is works if you're looking for a sit down dinner. Don't know that it surpasses Terroni or Libretto, but all in all, can't complain."}
{"text":"Loved this place until they changed the menu, use to go to the queen east location, but was excited when a Etobicoke location opened, because it's closer to me, went a few times when it first opened and it was just a good as the Queen east location, but sadly they menu has changed, and now the food is BLAND, the pizza crust is too thin in the middle and soft and mushy on the edges, and it lacks the fun huge bubbles that use to be on the edges with the nice brown crisp on them.. the sauce is BLAND no garlic or flavor at all. and I don't want a salad on my pizza, too many weird toppings and I HATE ARUGULA, it's bitter and unless your going to put a balsamic reduction on it it's just gross, the pizza was cold, as I watched the poor servers have to wait for this new chef to dress and cut each pizza, so the pizza sit's on the pass way way too long..And now to the prices..way way too much for a small pizza, guess these owners don't know the clients they are catering too, old money, sad to say but they are cheap, they won't pay more than $55-$65 for a family of 4 to eat pizza's and a couple of appetizers and drinks, with this price increase it's going to cost over $100 for a family of 4 to eat..and old money just won't pay that..they are thrifty with their money.. I won't be going back to this location EVER again the queen east location has thankfully kept their menu the same, and I will be heading back there next time I want a great Pizza..I say fire the chef, who btw smokes, so limited pallet. go back to what works, lower the prices and the old money crowd will return, I was astonished that I was able to get a reservation at 7:30 that should have been my first clue something was up, 3 months ago you couldn't get a reservation at this location until after 8:30 9:00 it was so booked up.. I feel sorry for their WONDERFUL staff, they are forced to SELL this new menu, to customers only to have the disappointing Food arrive, 35 min's later, which is now way way way longer than before..and it's COLD too boot.. I  have to say that over all the experience was disappointing and it's a shame because.. if it ain't broke-don't fix it..the place was excellent as it was, it didn't need to be shee shee foo fooed all up.."}
{"text":"Really disappointed by this place.  Went with a few friends, and we were all surprised by how mediocre the pizza was.  The place looks really nice, but the pizzas were just meh, and the service wasn't very friendly either.  Maybe was just an off night, but not likely going to return."}
{"text":"Not a particularly great experience. Limited menu and whwn I asked to make a substitution due to a good allergy, they have me a hard time telling me it wasn't possible. All in all even though it's around the corner from home probably wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"My girlfriend (a certified chef) and I went to this hip, new restaurant the other day.  On our way in, a guy stands in front of us (girls) with his arms cross (bouncer style), never greeted us, my girlfriend greeted him and asked for a table for 2.  \"Do you have reservation\", he asked... \"no we don't\" we said.  Mind you, it was only 5.30 pm on a Wednesday , there were over 10 empty tables.  They didn't even look at the reservation book to see (on a Wednesday if there was anything available.  Another guy (employee) was standing behind us said \"the bar\".  So picture this, the one bouncer standing in front of us and the other behind, no greetings, restaurant more than half empty and we were supposed to sit at the bar, sorry but no.  Way to go and make your customers really welcome, first impression matters."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Toronto and I've been to most of the VERA certified establishments, I would give it 5 stars if the prices were slightly lower, the drink list a little better and the menu a little more no nonsense.  Gorgeous dining room in an old bank, friendly staff and an interesting kitchen."}
{"text":"I've heard the food is quite good but the restaurant was so noisy this evening at 9:30 PM that my wife and I walked in and walked out. We already need hearing aids and didn't want to add to our diminished hearing. I would caution anybody don't forget your earplugs."}
{"text":"Great Pizza.  The sauce is flavorful (love the simple herbs and the consistency) and the pizza was baked in a fire brick oven.  I like having my pizza just near crispy, but not crispy.  They've always accommodated my request and do a great job.  I come here with family and friends.  Management here is great.  They're Courteous and go out of their way to make sure your time there is a great experience.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went here as part of a big group for a birthday party. The pizza was solid and the portions were generous. Service was spotty during the meal, but they didn't rush us out, either. I would definitely recommend this place for large groups. The location wasn't ideal via the TTC, but it didn't seem as busy as other places so we were able to hang out for a while after finishing our mains."}
{"text":"Such a great pizza joint right noir neighbourhood!!we have been many times and always delish! The prosciutto and arugula pizza is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Went there last night with a group of 10.  The service was excellent.   The arugula and romain salads were very fresh and full of flavor.   We also tried the queen's balls and they were moist and tasty.   The calabrese pizza was very spicy and excellent. All the pizzas were cooked perfectly....a little crispy.   I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have absolutely no clue why the rating for this QMP (or any of the QMPs!) is not higher.   First, disclaimer: I rarely give 5 star reviews. Also, pizza is ACTUALLY my favourite food ever, so you can bet that I'm discerning about it (and have tried a wild variety of them).   The pizza here is absolutely amazing. Seriously. I am not the biggest fan of cheese, and I've only been easing my way into enjoying cheese and meat platters in the last few years, but the cheese on the pizzas here -- I will go out of my way to pick up off the plate and shove in my mouth.   The margherita pizza (surprise, surprise) is the real winner. It's so incredibly simple, as of course, it's just tomato sauce, basil, and mozzarella. But it's just SO good. \We've been here three times now, 2 pizzas each time, and every time, the margherita is one of them. I don't even really like basil either, but it seems when it's cooked at high temperatures and eaten on a pizza, it works amazingly.   The crusts here are also perfectly chewy, the middle of the pizza has *never* been soggy, and the toppings work so well. The Calabrese and Diavola pizzas are also great. I haven't tried one of the white pizzas yet but that's because a pizza without tomato sauce feels wrong to me, but at the rate that we're coming here, we'll eventually have to try every pizza on the menu!  Never had any complaints with the service here, and even on the busiest of nights, they make an effort to get us seated.   It's a lovely open concept atmosphere, where you share an entire room with all the other patrons and the kitchen itself. When it's busy, it's bustling, but despite the openness of the room, you can hear your dining companions perfectly well -- and maybe it's the illusion that happens with big crowds, but it feels almost more private than if you were in a smaller room with less people.   P.S. Prefer the pizza here over Pizzeria Libretto and every other thin crust pizza I've tried to date. I haven't had the ones at Terroni yet but they're next!"}
{"text":"Would have chosen 3.5 stars if it was an option. Rounded down based on the lack of ambience and noise level.  Had the GF pizza crust which was average.  My boyfriend had the regular traditional pizza.  We both rated the pizza as good but not spectacular.  Decent variety of pizzas to choose from.  This location can get loud. It feels much too large (high ceilings) and lackluster design sense.  Service was attentive.  (PS. In case you're wondering, Libretto Pizzi would receive the same rating. Their (spelt) pizza was also only average.)"}
{"text":"We have never been disappointed here. We love the Giovanna and romaine salad. This is a great addition to the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Beautiful building with high ceilings and exposed brick interior. Wood pizza oven is exposed for all to see. Prix fixed menu is good value. Always busy on the weekend evenings cuz it's the place to be."}
{"text":"The pizza was the best in Toronto!   Tomato sauce was sweet but not overpowering. The crust is very light and thin, with locally made mozzarella (if you order a pizza with mozzarella of course). The oven that they use was built from people that they flown in for Italy. Because of this, the pizza is very traditional. I liked the calabrese sausage although the others at my table felt it was too spicy.   The service is very good and I got a chance to meet the owner of the restaurants. The waiter that we had is a writer for the irrelevant show on CBC Radio (very cool!). They screwed up our order by giving us another pizza, which was on the house after we asked why there was an extra pizza on the table (another awesome twist to the evening).   They are only open for dinner for now but will open for lunch starting on weekends. In conclusion, its great, so if your in the area give it a try. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food! We came here one night and shared the wings and caprese salad, the salad was one of the best I ever had and I eat caprese everywhere I go.... The wings were delicious with spicy oil and a creamy dressing for dipping yummy. We got the pizza with sausage and Parmesan, the flavours were lovely and the crust was beautiful. I then alone ate the flourless chocolate tort all to myself, it was so good! This place rocks!"}
{"text":"I dream of this pizza. This is my favourite pizza place. Ingredients are fresh and dough is outta this world."}
{"text":"It's really 3 and a half stars....  Service was great: server was friendly, attentive, knowledgeable, etc.   The windows are very tall, and the building is on a corner, so it was full of natural light.  I believe it's an old bank building, so it's one big cavernous room, but with a friendly and festive atmosphere (people from other tables chatted a bit, the room buzzes with conversation).    Food was good, and reasonably priced.   I don't personally care for sundried tomatoes, and it seemed an inordinate number of the pizzas came with that topping, but that's not really such a big deal...there were still good choices.  Probably I should rate higher, but the location is Leslieville is better....."}
{"text":"I ordered the margarita pizza and an Italian soda. It came up to about $20 which isn't horrible. The pizza was thin crust and the dough was super chewy. The sauce was not seasoned and the toppings were barely there. The waitress was ok. Your paying for the atmosphere. Its a cute restaurant. The food was mediocre"}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza. We took my parents who only like to go out to eat if it is pizza, and if the pizza is good. They loved the pizza and the locale, as did we.  The only think I would like changed is for the addition of a hoppy IPA on tap.  The pizza was cooked perfectly and was not greasy at all.  Just super."}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying that I am not a pizza fan at all whatsoever. I know, I know - who doesn't like pizza? Well, me.... until I came to this place.  Nice thin crust, great selection of toppings - and well-made cocktails.   If you can win over someone like me, you're doing something right."}
{"text":"Queen Margherita has clearly made a name for themselves in this city. With two locations, a third on the way I constantly see them ranked as one of the top three pizza places in the city so I had to give them a try.  They most certainly lived up to their reputation. The pizza is a little saucier than some of their competitor, but fantastic  never the less.  The only complaint I had was that the noise levels we oh the high side. I could barely hear the person across from me.   Overall, definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Had the deal of an app, pizza and dessert for $30. Ordered the Arancini which was okay, the cinque staggione pizza and it was really good. For dessert I had the flourless chocolate cake with strawberries and ice cream and it was delicious. Only downfall, too many annoying children running around with parents that didn't care to control them. Will probably return during the day instead next time."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. We came with a child. They were equipped with a high chair and the server offered to make a quick cheese pizza for him which was really helpful.  Our food came reasonably quickly and was excellent.  Very similar pizza to Libretto."}
{"text":"Ordered through ubereats - they give you updates on when the food is being prepared, when it's picked up, when it's on the way and when it arrives. Absolutely loved how efficient it was!  The pizzas were great. 4 ladies shared 3 pizzas. Each had 4 slices which was perfect. Birdman was really saucey with the dressing on top and kale was perfect. The other two were good but nothing new and definitely felt a little too pricey."}
{"text":"Terrible service with a  very slow and rude hostess.  Pizza was ok."}
{"text":"Read my tip section review!! I've described the place in details! Overall, very good spot!"}
{"text":"We have been to this place several time for lunch and supper. They are very accommodating for large groups and for young children. They even have gluten free pizza that doesn't taste like cardboard which is a major draw for my wife. Sides and salads are very good. Overall great food and service."}
{"text":"Food here was great as was the service.  We just moved and were looking for a place to eat.  This is across the street and we're loving it.  We've been to the Queen St E location as well; that one I think is louder and too busy for me.  But the food at Queen might have an edge."}
{"text":"This place is a delicious experience, they have stove cooked pizza, it was perfectly crunchy and the ingredients are what they say: authentic. You have to come here. One thing I enjoyed was their choices of pizza, I had the Gio Oldschool with spicy oil. It's the most popular and you won't regret it. I FORGOT, their tiramisu was to die for. Try it."}
{"text":"Like the pizza but consistently the service has been terrible. It starts with wait at the door to be seated while staff laugh and joke with me another and then very slow service both to have order taken and brought to table. Waiter had snotty attitude and was always talking to other staff so difficult to get her attention to order another glass of wine."}
{"text":"I don't usually leave bad reviews but this time I must do It and only for helping them to improve service, quality of food and recipes: had arancini who they presented as stuffed with porcini mushroom but they were tasting like a rice pudding ball without any taste. Result: left! Had beef carpaccio but poor of arugula and shaved parmigiano, nothing to say regarding the topping of oyster mushrooms, because we had to ask for an extra. Calamari? Well that's the biggest disappointment tonight: as Italian and also as chef I was expecting calamari rings to delight my craving .. Well no rings but pieces of calamari and tentacoles. They Need to review the serving size, it could be 2 nor 3 oz in total. Imagine? I'm not a big fun of Neapolitan pizza but it was burned. I probably won't suggest neither return."}
{"text":"Everything is good, however there is a fine line with serving good thin crust pizza, and burnt thin crust pizza. Unfortunately our order was on the burnt side, which meant a burned flavor more than anything."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place!  Went for lunch with my family.  Pizza was amazing.  The mozzarella makes me want to go back right now...so fresh!  The lunch special of app/dessert with pizza for $23 was great value.  We took leftovers home!    Great ambience and is located in an old bank location!  Staff gave great recommendations and really genuine people!  I'm going back for certain!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this area to walk around in. I had my eye on this place for quite some time as I do take my usual strolls in the area. After some back and forth likes on Instagram, I finally decided to come out to this place with a friend. Luckily, it was a cheat day for me because I WOLFED down the entire pizza. I asked for the simple Margherita pizza... Simplicity at its best. My friend ordered La Scala which was great as well, recommended by the pretty waitress. It was a perfect blend of hot and sweet. The pizza crust was thin and crispy as it should be. :)  The kitchen is of open concept which is nice. I love this idea of seeing how the kitchen prepares  your food.   Thank QMP! Dinner was great, tasty and your staff is wonderful."}
{"text":"The pizza here is better than Pizza Libretto but not as good as some of the other wood fired pizza joints in Toronto.  The crust was tasty, but a bit soggy and undercooked in the centre.  Toppings were pretty good.  Service was good and fast.  I found the room to be extremely noisy - it's basically a big can filled with people.    If I lived in the neighbourhood, I would probably eat here often without complaints. But I don't think I would go out of my way to get here because there are better pizza places in the city."}
{"text":"I've probably been here 5-6 times since it's opened, and unfortunately the quality of the pizza has definitely gone downhill. The last two times the pizza has been so burned on the bottom that it just tastes like charcoal. For the price, I expect perfection (it's just pizza after all!).  No real issues regarding service, we've always had positive experiences and they've been very accommodating."}
{"text":"What has happened here ? I have been many times and it continues to go down hill . Pizza was not crispy , lacking flavour as well , empty room also surprised me on a Thursday . Generic charcuterie board with product you can buy at any super market . Servers are still very friendly and good . I will give it one more try and hope pizza gets better . If not its back to vesuvios  pizzeria on Dundas my go too take out ."}
{"text":"After hearing so many good things about queen margherita, I finally decided to come here with my family last night. We sat down at around 5ish, so it wasn't as busy. Because it was our first time there we had a hard time deciding what kind of pizza to get, but our waiter who BTW is awesome gave us his recommendations and we went with it.  Good thing we did because the pizzas did not disappoint! I dont remember what the pizzas were called but one of them was the dominator (which was my fav!) They were delicious, I even ate the crust and I never eat the crusts lol.  After pizza, we got desserts and once again went with our waiter's recommendations which were the tiramisu and the flourless chocolate cake. Absolutely on point!  One reason why I won't give it 4 stars is because the service was beyond slow. I'm not sure if it's because maybe the pizza takes a really long time to make or they had to go through a long tunnel to get dessert ready..who knows lol.   Anyways, I'll still come back because the pizzas are actually really good and it's in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We had good service. Our server was entertaining; however, they didn't admit to forgetting one of our pizzas (the drawbacks of having an open kitchen with us being one of the only tables in the restaurant for an early dinner by comparison to most folks). Ultimately the last pizza was delivered, obviously after a couple of inquiries.   The most entertaining part of the evening was discovering from our server that calamari is a seasonal dish. The calamari wasn't available on the menu, and that was the story he shared with us.   I'm not a big lover of large crusts; as such, I only ate 7/8 of the pizza. Of what I ate, it was very good, but too bad that the crust was so overwhelming."}
{"text":"Get the prefix deal. For 30$ You get any app, any pizza & any desert Yummmmm! Great for any date night!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best spots for Napoletano pizza in the city. Consistently good pizzas, good wine and beer selection and great appetizers. We usually try a different appetizer every time we visit, and they've all been good so far. The restaurant itself is pretty cool, they took over a bank building and did a good job of the interior, keeping some of the bank's finishes. The prix fixe menu is a good deal. This is also a family friendly place, you'll see a lot of kids in there, especially on weekdays. Usually really busy at dinner times. Don't recommend the pizza for takeout, it's needs to be eaten while fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic Arancini for starters. Wonderful.  Pizza, although a good one, still for me not the best. I like my crust to be a bit crispier, it is out of wildfires oven after all. And the red sauce is a bit watery and could be more concentrated.  Overall a good experience, though the first waitress brought me my order boxed although I wanted to eat in. Only free chair at bar was at end where people pick up orders, but I had sat down, took off jacket didn't order take out. Second waitress was absolutely lovely.  I will come again"}
{"text":"At the recommendation of friends, my family of 4 decided to give QMP a try.   QMP offered a reasonable selection of pizzas however if you are looking for a more \"meaty\" option, you won't find a pizza here.   We made our selections and the food was ok, and the service was adequate (not memorable).   However I don't think we will be back, there are better (tastier and better value) options around."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very nicely done up, large, and well lit. The servers are very friendly and helpful, and overall, I had a great experience there. However, the pizza itself was average at best and cannot even be compared to Libretto. Their pizza base is not thin enough for a Neapolitan style pizza, the mozzarella is average, and the pizzas were, in some cases so over baked that the cheese was dry, browned and crisp (as opposed to being gooey, bubbling, and blistered in a few spots).   Of course, it might just have been an off day for the chef when I visited, so I will perhaps, give it another try and update this review, should an update be warranted."}
{"text":"I'm also surprised at Queen Margherita's lacklustre rating. Ever since I moved to the area everyone has told me how good it is and I finally got to try it recently. I was very impressed with the quality and taste of the pizza.   We arrived at about 6pm on a Friday and did not have a reservation.  They were able to fit us in and the place soon became very busy. It's quite large too.   The pizzas are a little on the pricier side but they are quality with a lot of interesting toppings. There's a good selection of pizzas with and without sauce which I thought was pretty cool.   I'll definitely be back at some point."}
{"text":"Late night, recommended by friends, pricey....  But what they've got is sincerity. This is our pizza, try these combinations please, we want you to have an experience. Not generic...in the prix fixe menu, we had amazing selections, an abundance of arugula (hurray!) and an altogether refreshing late dinner.   It's a love it or hate it place. Interestingly, all the reviews here are worth reading: if you want cheap fast food pizza, you will not find it here and you will hate it."}
{"text":"+  Great food/variety +  Awesome atmosphere/design +  Good prices  -  No wifi offered  As a visitor to the Toronto area (from California) I was definitely craving some good old fashioned pizza after non-stop Chinese food with my family haha.  This place came highly recommended so I was eager to try.  The food was great and the variety of offerings was the same.  It was the middle of the week day so there weren't a lot of customers but they had plenty of inside seating (plenty for our party of 18 or so).  I'm being petty here, but I did mention not having public wifi as a negative only because coming from the USA, I did not have data.  How else would I share my Yelp review and check in haha!  I did see two wifi SSIDs with their name so they do have it.  I guess they just don't provide it to their customers."}
{"text":"This place is such a great place to have datenights. The atmosphere is so comfortable. The service is friendly and quick. The food, is consistently AAAMAZING. This is our fav pizza in Toronto!!"}
{"text":"I finally made to the Queen Margherita Pizza in Baby Point.   I'm a resident of Bloor West and was very happy and excited to have it added to the neighbourhood last year.   I went on a Thursday night and the place was full of locals from the 'hood: couples, families (yes, some kids), and small groups of friends, like my 3 girlfriends and I.   The ambience is great - music not too loud, tables not too cramped, casual and classy.   The food? Great!  I'm not a huge fan of pizza, but I had to try the Margherita and it went great with my glass of red. My girlfriend's salad was very generous and delicious. A tad pricey, but hey, it's Bloor West.   Our server could have been a bit warmer, but we forgave her - we were 4 ladies who couldn't stop yammering away and may have ignored her a few times when she tried to take our order.  (Hey, we hadn't seen each other in a while, girls gotta catch up, you know?)   It's a great addition to the neighbourhood, I'm glad it's here. I just may bring the kids next time."}
{"text":"Pizza pizza pizza. What's there not to love about pizza.   This place is reasonably priced - $16-20 for a personal pizza and is definitely a meals worth. Drinks are also reasonable - $8 for a pint.   Service was good. We were a group of 10 and we didn't have to wait long for our food. The only issue was that our server decided to put everything on one bill and couldn't provide separate bills after the fact. So if you want separate bills, ask them beforehand. Not a huge issue, but a slight inconvenience.  The pizza itself has great toppings and everyone's meal looked great. The dough is usually what make or breaks a pizza and their dough was excellent (which made for a nice soft crust, with the perfect amount of crunch from the fire oven.   Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Sunday, and i was surprised how empty it was. We were the only tabl for at least 30 minutes.  Eventually people did start coming in, larger groups. But this place is quite large and it did not come close to filling up. The oven didn't even seem like it was on at first.  So we had the margherita pizza and the diavola pizza (hot salami). Both tasted good, decent heat on the salami, crust was crispy. Though I gotta say my jaw started to hurt a bit with all the chewing.  Service was nice, but often times I felt it hard to get their attention even with no one there.  Bathrooms are downstairs, really wished with all this space it was on the main floor.  The Prix fix menu is pretty good if you plan to order a few things, I'm not sure if it's lunch only or all day. One pizza, one appetizer and one dessert for $29. Not bad when you consider a pizza and an appetizer is basically $29 already. But is this a $29 lunch place for one person? I'd be hard pressed to say it was. Shared makes it more reasonable."}
{"text":"Since the oft-delayed opening, this place has been a tough reservation to pin down.  I was expecting to be letdown after the build up and heightened expectations, and I came away noting the strengths are strong, and the weaknesses evident.  A converted bank at the corner of Annette and Jane St, this is not a neighbourhood chockablock with eateries.  What struck me was the surprisingly spacious interior.  What disappointed me was how they crammed nondescript tables into every square foot therein.  We were a large group, and our server could not access the back half of our group without inconveniencing the adjacent tables and weaving her way into our midst.  Table service was friendly but strained (Saturday night, the place was packed), but the hostess station was not welcoming at all.  A very entitled attitude from the dude at the door.  Buddy, this is Jane and Annette, not Madison and 44th...  Menu selection is simple- rustic Italian pizza from wood burning oven.  Quality cheese from the Cheese Boutique, and market fresh herbs.  The shrimp appetizer was very good.  Price tag was about what I expected.  The true test for this place will be to see how many return customers they get after the opening months are behind them.  Summary- great, fresh food; and service can improve to take the experience to the next level."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from Uber eats Order totalled over 70$ Ordered a Caesar salad- $12 for a few pieces of lettuce- pics attached And calamari at $13 ridiculous prices for these 2 items Definitely not recommended Pizza good- but cold on arrival Will spend money elsewhere  - pics are uneaten as delivered"}
{"text":"Exceedingly kid-friendly, albeit a bit loud, the QMP at Jane & Annette is a cavernous old bank branch.  The massive wood-fired oven churns out delicious, perfectly crafted and baked Neapolitan pies.  The menu is ridiculously simple, and everything we've had is great. The salads are fresh with a great balance of flavors. The pizzas are divided into those with and without red sauce, and have a great combination of toppings. The desserts are great, including the Nutella pizza, the Nutella budino (like a Nutella pudding - it's better if you ask for no whipped cream), topped with sea salt.  I absolutely adore this place, and can think of nothing better than a QMP pie, a bottle of wine, and a snowy night."}
{"text":"I have been here on three previous occasions and returned the other night for the first time in a few months.  Sadly, the menu, food, and experience had changed.   Initially, they seemed set on having a good vibe with reasonably creative pizzas. Now, it seems like they got carried away, trying to be some culinary surprise or win Top Chef Canada, and no longer a pizza place. Here's what's wrong:  1. The pizzas at my table were too salty, too greasy and had too much going on. 2. The tuna app was unappetizingly fishy. 3. They try to take a page from pizzeria Libretto... By using ingredients (meats) no one has heard of or eats often, they can seem more sophisticated and charge more money. The problem here is that they go too far. I had rather pay 18$ for a damn good pepperoni pizza than a lousy pizza that has leeks, walnuts, speck, cat hearts, or whatever else no one can pronounce or recognize. 4. They have a beautiful bar, but no bar business. The bar identity (like the restaurant) is torn between pizza place bar and sophisticated cocktail bar. It does neither well. They need smaller, simpler bar plates and possibly a beer or wine special or damn good cocktails to build this side of the business. 5. Without alcohol my bill came to nearly 100$ with tax and tip for two pizzas and two appetizers that were all somewhere between ok and \"never again\".  The place is nice and the staff are clearly trying their best to provide decent service. However, it is too expensive and off the mark to make this my (or anyone's) go to (or return to) pizza place."}
{"text":"Excellent Neopolitan style pizza! Some interesting appetizers as well including my sea bass carpaccio. Lots of comfortable seating with large windows."}
{"text":"Great pizza cooked very quickly in their wood burning oven. Their staff is professional and service has always been excellent."}
{"text":"It's been four years since my last review...  I'm doubling the score.  This place is great now, and the staff are very accommodating and delightful.  The 23 dollar lunch deal is great (pizza and app).  30 bucks if you want dessert (the 30 dollar deal is available all day long.)  Pizzas range from 15 to 20 bucks.  Go for the spicey options.  They're devine.  I've been back a couple of times this year.  Glad I decided to give it another shot."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite pizza place!  The pizza is always tasty.  I love how the flavour of the ingredients mix so well together.  The La Scala and Dominator are my favourites!  I also love that you can ask for their chili oil to add a little more spice and flavour.  Not only are their pizzas good, but so are their desserts!  We always get the Prix Fixe menu and their appetizers are good too.  Too bad they took of the arancini, that was my fave.  Their flourless chocolate cake and tiramisu are yummy!"}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant multiple times. It definitely is kid friendly, and interestingly it seems to work for parents very well when they arrive early (5-6 p.m.) for dinner (when kids are usually hungry) without a reservation even on weekend nights. Wine and cocktails are just fine for a pizza restaurant. My husband and I have sampled a variety of the pizzas at this point, and all were quite tasty and very similar to what you would find in Rome.   However--it is too expensive (especially considering what you would pay for similar fare in actual Italy). That is one of my beefs. It generally costs my family of four about $90-100 for three pizzas and drinks. My kids love the pizza though, and really enjoy going there. My second beef would be the wait staff quality/consistency. We have had some very nice servers and others who were too busy texting behind the bar to bring us our food and bill. My third beef might be that it is \"too\" kid friendly, in that every time I have visited this restaurant I have witnessed terribly behaved children and parents (i.e., making paper airplanes out of napkins and throwing them at the decor, topping out on the booths, while mom and dad drink wine and totally ignore their kids). I would never let my kids act like that in a restaurant!  A suggestion--I think their bar is beautiful and they could do well by taking advantage of that fact and staying open later. With a better wine selection and a few more appetizer offerings it would make for a lovely wine bar. As it is, no one really uses the bar for anything more than waiting for their take away or table."}
{"text":"Very tasty but way too expensive. $18 dollars for a personalized pie and $10 for a drink. I'm rebelling towards all pizza places charging so much for a personalized pizza. The cost on that is so small. Unfortunately I have strict guidelines on my star rating system and I can not go lower than 3 stars."}
{"text":"Left: Diavola - fior do latte, hot sopressata and black olives (we opted out of the hot peppers)   Right: Gio Oldschool - fior di latte, cherry tomatoes, prosciutto di parma and arugula   By luck my cousin wanted to go for pizza and me being the foodie that I am I brought her here. Food was obviously fresh to order and tasted amazing. The wait time wasn't too long, we did get there just after 6pm. The service was good. I believe we were served by the bartender and he was nice. I would give it a 4/5 and would definitely go back agains"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why they only have three stars. This was my second visit and I thoroughly enjoyed both.   The service is friendly and efficient. The space and decor is fun and modern. It looks to be a family friendly location as well as suitable for date nights (like ours).   The food is fantastic. There are a number of gluten free friendly options on the menu and they make the best gluten free pizza crust I've tasted in a restaurant that I didn't make myself. Queen Marguerita hasn't just ordered frozen, cardboard-like gluten free crust from a manufacturer, they've set out  to perfect the dough themselves to mimic the glorious Neapolitan style pizzas they are known for. It's chewy and crispy at the same time and makes me never want to order from another pizza joint again. Ever. The different pies we've tried have been incredible. It's a bit of a hike to get there from downtown and we've done it twice in two months in winter temperatures and was our choice for Valentine's Day. That says volumes. The desserts are decadent - we shared the flourless chocolate cake and the Nutella, salted caramel budino and ate every last crumb even as full as we were.   They take gluten free seriously - they have a dedicated separate oven to ensure as little cross contamination as possible."}
{"text":"What a weird (but good overall!) experience I had here.  Let's talk first impressions. This place was once a scotiabank and it's so painfully obvious from outside. I really think they should have at least changed the facade or something, what a weird feeling when I saw it (\"but this is a scotiabank!\"). The inside makes up for it though, it's a large open space with an open concept kitchen and a large bar, which is quite light and airy. It's very nice!   We had to wait about 15 minutes for our table for the group of 13. It was annoying because we had a reservation, but not a big deal overall because of the large bar with plenty of room for us to wait!   Once seated, I had a chance to review their rather small menu. While small, it was the right size - there are lots of pizza options without it being overwhelming. There are also a selection of crostini!   I had the chance to sample four of the pizzas, the dominator, the tominator, the bird man and one other. They were all excellent, my favourite was by far the tom. We ordered a pizza per person on my half of the table which was right because we are big eaters, but lots of people split pizzas. I also tried some delicious crostini! My favourite was the sweet onion.   The service was great but our server was a bit too chatty / chummy near the end of the experience, hanging out a bit too long and talking about old jobs. I could have just been extra grumpy because I was ready to go home but it was weird!   Overall a great pizza experience!"}
{"text":"Since we've been living in the area, we watched this space transform from a bank to a wrestling school and now the West side branch of Queen Margherita Pizza.  They have done a remarkable renovation to the interior!  It's open concept with high ceilings and everyone has a nice view of the tiled pizza oven in the exposed kitchen.  We made last minute reservations online as we feared a wait.  I had walked by several times and saw line ups for hungry patrons waiting at 5pm for the doors to open, not to mention a packed dining room on weekends.  Arriving around 6pm, we were seated immediately in a half full dining room.  Our server came to take drink orders.  We decided to go with a 1/2 litre of the Norman Hardie riesling ($32) on tap at our server's recommendation.  I'm not usually a riesling drinker and found this particular one to taste too much like alcoholic apple juice.  Pizza order - we went with the Calabrese ($16.95) and the Capicola ($17.95).  Pizzas came quickly.  The Calabrese had a nice spicy sausage on top while the Capicola had prosciutto with mushrooms.  Both were tasty and I enjoyed the thin crust.  Service was friendly throughout the meal and we never felt rushed even though we lingered at the end of our meal to chat.  I wished that the tables were spread a bit further apart as our neighbours probably got an earful of our conversation.  Queen Margherita Pizza will do well at this location catering to the Baby Point and Bloor West/Junction crowds.  There are no other eateries quite like it in this area, while Buddha Pie Pizza at Runnymede and Annette is probably feeling the pinch."}
{"text":"I go here all the time because the pizza is just plain delicious and quick. The staff are reliably friendly.   I give it 4 stars (3.5 really) because the décor is lacking and I think you can get great pizza for better prices elsewhere... but it's a great neighbourhood standby for when you're craving good pizza."}
{"text":"Had one of the best dining experiences that we've had in a long time. The food was excellent and the service was outstanding (thanks again Justin!)"}
{"text":"This place seems to have a great reputation for awesome pizza but I found it to be very ordinary.  I had to custom order two pizzas with Calabrese to give the pizzas some zing.  Somewhat dry.  Not worth repeating for me.  The prices are quite high too."}
{"text":"Booked a party of 25 here only two weeks out from the event date and they were incredibly accommodating. There was concern about fitting 25 around the family style table but they made it work comfortably. The staff is great here and they made sure everyone's food came out quick and hot - even though they can only cook 5 pizzas at once! Apparently each pizza only take 90 seconds to cook but still, there was a lot of care and planning that went into making it work and we appreciated that. We were even able to bring our own birthday cake with no cutting fee. We served it ourselves but they stored it and carried it out :)   The food is exactly what you want in an authentic pizza place. A great menu, not too big but thoughtfully compiled. A reasonably priced wine selection and a great cocktail menu. Thank you again to the staff, you guys made our Mom's birthday something she will never forget."}
{"text":"I Love this place! A pizza é maravilhosa, o atendimento é ótimo e o preço melhor ainda. Hiper recomendo!"}
{"text":"Very good place to eat pizza! They are very tasty with a fair price. We definitely will go back."}
{"text":"The staff here are exceedingly friendly, and I love the wood fired oven, as well as the wine selection - but if I compare this place to Terroni's pizza, Terroni definitely wins out!  I definitely appreciate that they are more accommodating with toppings on their pizza than Terroni,  but something about the flavour profile just doesn't work here for me, on all the pizzas I have tried - Birdman, Cheaky Florence, the Tominator - other than the margherita pizza.  I keep trying a different one every time so I can hopefully change my mind!  Also: the hot peppers also lack kick!!  But, in terms of finding a good pizza place in the neighbourhood, this is probably the closest one, so we keep returning.  If you do plan on coming, definitely make reservations if you can!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is perfectly textured straight out of the oven. But if you wait too long to eat the pizza, it does lose some of that texture and gets soft and dense. Highly recommend to dine in rather than bring home. Beef carpaccio, kale salad are great starters, the prix fixe deal is excellent value. Desserts are very tasty, too. Nice servers. Very kid-friendly. Our 6- and 9-year old were made to feel welcome and even got to sit at the bar for a half hour to entertain themselves with soft drink sipping."}
{"text":"Ok at best.  Dough is gummy and nowhere near authentic.  Waiter was unattentive, even though I tried to get his attention many times.  Prices are ok for this type of pizza but this pizza doesn't deliver like authentic oven pizza from places that make a real pizza."}
