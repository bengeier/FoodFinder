{"text":"Discovered this breakfast joint while our house was being built in Medina. Haven't had lunch there. If you want fancy, don't come here, it's an old school dive, and that's part of it's appeal. If you want hot, cheap, fast, tasty breakfast-this is the place! The home fries are homemade, you know, with real potatoes. Not that frozen processed junk the breakfast chains use. The Belgian waffles are not good, though. They are pre made and then thrown on the grill to heat up. That's gross and i'm not sure why they do that because it does not take that long to dump batter on a waffle iron and cook it. For eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage, toast-so worth it! And during the Christmas/Candlelight walk parade you can walk in there and get a hot, fresh cup of coffee to go to warm you up for much cheaper than down the street!"}
{"text":"Have only eaten breakfast here, but the food is good, you get a lot, and it's extremely cheap (you can eat a full & hearty breakfast, with coffee, for less than $5 per person).  Staff is always friendly, but it is more of a dive diner than upscale eating.  We like to walk here on Saturday mornings for breakfast and there's always a decent crowd there."}
{"text":"I usually attempt to over estimate a new restaurant in order to give them the benefit of the doubt. This place is exactly worth the price. It's cheap, but in return it provide crappy service, jeering from the kitchen and a general rude, unwelcoming attitude. You can't fuck breakfast up, but they did. There are two other breakfast restaurants right next to this place that could light me on fire and would still be the better option."}
{"text":"After raving to my girlfriend about how this old-school diner had super affordable breakfast and a quaint classic old fashion setting, I finally had the chance to bring her there (visiting from LA). Upon entering, everyone facility looked at us with a scowl. With reluctance the waitress came up to us and said please wait. So, we waited for five minutes. After which we spied a few open tables, went up to one of them and cleaned it off our self. We sat there taking in the hustle and bustle of the restaurant. After another 10 minutes and watching other people come in and have their orders taken, we decided maybe we were sitting in a cursed section. 
Find me a waitress came up to our table section grabbed a few tips off of the surrounding tables looked at us and said \"I'm out of here\".
Continue to sit there and wait patiently with a smile on my face watching others who came in after us be served.
So, we thought maybe we can sit at the counter/bar and get some service, and do them a favor at the same time. Well, then we heard the waitresses saying \"I'm not going to help them\".
After hearing that we decided to leave. 
We went next door to Marie's and were kindly greater and had a wonderful home style breakfast with perfect service."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a classic diner, look no further. The food Is great and the prices are amazing. The staff are super friendly, which definitely enhances the family atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not a pleasant display of food choices. Restrooms not up to quality standards. Water was bitter. Taste of food just ok"}
{"text":"This place by far had the worst food I have ever been served. The first thing is they should take the word Lebanese off the window that's what drew me in. The falafel I ordered was unlike any I had had before . A ball of uncooked grain. My quest had another 2 items from the menu that were equally disgusting. I am also surprised the health department has not closed this place down. Dirty everything sticky"}
{"text":"There nothing more like where the local goes Every morning for Breakfast. Eli's Kitchen is one of the best places to stop at on the square no matter if their an event going on or not. The food, the staff u name it are always good and easy to find place to sit. One thing that people need to realize service can be a little slow on days when their a big event going on the square from parades, Farmer market, etc but that should not stop you from trying this place. If something does not seem right speak up and say it. Just be thankful you got your food. 

   i see most people complaint about the coffee or the service maybe the people passing through don't experience this but all it takes is patient. Give Eli's a second chance."}
{"text":"We ordered the Lebanese Feast which included hummus, grape leaves, and falafel.     We knew we were in for a treat when the cook didn't know what our meal consisted of and the waitress had to bring over the menu to show him.   The falafel tasted like small balls of very dry cornmeal.  The grape leaves didn't taste fresh and the hummus was inedible.    

With regards to the atmosphere it did not seem very clean.   The cups were chipped and cloudy.  The speakers and wires that fed them probably were not dusted in 5 years, if ever.    The floors were not clean.   The waitresses were all sitting at the counter which seemed a little strange.

We took a couple bites of our food and left."}
{"text":"First let me say that my boyfriend got a hamburger and stated that it was the best burger he's ever had. The fries were great and it was all very fresh. It was huge and filling with a nice roll. The chef cooked it to perfection. So for all that why the 1 star rating? Well, everything else is the reason. There was no excuse for the outdated and dilapidated interior, the drinking glasses that were badly chipped that won't come clean should have been thrown out years ago and no excuse for the dirty cook top. The salad I got didn't taste good and the dressing was bitter. The dressing was also served in a plastic cup and was not homemade. The sign says home cooking but it clearly isn't, because if it was they would take the time to make their own dressings. I asked which soup was fresh and the waitress said none. None of the soup was fresh daily and she couldn't give me a date as to when it was made. It was also microwaved and had hot and cold spots. Microwaved soup in a diner??? Why?  It was spilling over the bowl and partially burnt on the side. YUCK!!! She never once asked me how my meal was but stared at me the whole time, so I think she knew something was up. My advice, Gut the place! Start over! Please!! Get rid of all the dishes and glassware and start over. Sell your burgers, upgrade your salads! Make your dressings FRESH! Make your soup FRESH daily! i guarantee then you will be the busiest place in town. Talk to your staff in the back about business not on the floor in front of guests. Maybe they are going for greasy spoon? But it's not good and isn't that the point of selling food?"}
{"text":"Eli's Kitchen is a very nice place, if you're looking for tasty, but inexpensive food. About, right when you sit down, they give you their menus so you can order. It is a very nice place, if you're looking for some nice kind of like fast food but still freshly homemade. It is also like an old fashioned diner . The waiters and waitresses are very nice my order was the top of the, breakfast special. 2 eggs, (over easy) some English muffins, potatoes, and bacon. For my drink, I got hot chocolate. When they put the whipped cream on it, it was everywhere, so minus a bit for that.. But overall it was fascinating. When I got my food, my potatoes were cold, and my eggs were more likely over hard, than over easy. My mum was upset when they did not have Tabasco sauce. But overall, the food was delicious, and for a good price too. I haven't tried anything else yet but, I'm sure it is delicious. 4 out of 5 stars. I will be back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and you can't beat the prices. The atmosphere was great and relaxed. Not only were the workers beyond nice and kind, but so were the other customers. Just an overall great experience and we plan on being regulars!"}
{"text":"Misleading.   They have a menu outside with prices and you think WOW that's not bad walk in and their table menus are $2 more.   Walked in and the waitress said \"you do know it will be about 45 right\" yeah no kidding I read the sign.   When I ordered the off the kids menu for portion control she kinda looked away and then wrote my order down. From the time we got our drinks to our meal we waited 30 minutes just for refills on our drinks and she blamed it on being busy when it wasn't all that busy when she looked at our table 3 times within 30 minutes. Don't know if we will be back or not."}
{"text":"The end of my Family Sunday Breakfasts at Eli's... Goodbye to old school breakfast place, bad coffee, shady looking staff, grease filled food at a good price. You can still get the greasy food, bad coffee and shady looking service juts expect to now pay 2-1/2 times what you did just 6 months ago. The old staple of 2 eggs, toast and barely a hint of  meat and potatoes for $1.99, then $2.99 then $3.99 is gone, it's now just been raised again to $5, and the quality is still the same. Sorry Eli's, these are Bob Evans prices, so we will go to the cleaner higher quality Bob Evans. 

Actually left once we saw the increase... Good news is they now have new menus"}
{"text":"If I could give less than a star I would... I love local places and small dive diners are one of my favorite things! HOWEVER this place was absolutely awful. We arrived at 10:30. Didn't get to place an order until  10 till 11. And didn't get our food forty five mins!!!!! For eggs and potatoes! On top of it all the waitress brought the food and flat out said \"let me know if it's even warm enough for you\" hahaha what a joke!! Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"One of those little local shops you have to try.  Might not be the prettiest shop in town but that just adds to the atmosphere.  Great breakfast and good prices. Come in and support local business!

Update:  Yup, still awesome!  I recommend the Greek omelet.  Credit cards are now accepted for any purchase over $5."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch. Got the \"large Greek salad\". Probably the worst Greek salad I have ever had.  The toughest parts of the mixed lettuces, including end pieces. Huge hunks of onion and the gyro meat may as well been steak-umms.  Maybe I should have gone with breakfast, Idk.  For what I paid for the salad, what could be eaten, over-priced and not good...."}
{"text":"Eli's is often a breakfast stop we make before hitting the Medina County farmers market.  If you want gourmet, go next door to Marie's.  Divey, greasy, cheap, awesome."}
{"text":"Been going there for years. Good food, good prices, best coffee. A nice way to warm up on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Eli's Kitchen serves up a tasty and reasonably-priced breakfast, and has plenty of other delicious-looking American and Lebanese food on the menu for lunch and dinner, as well. 

My mother and I came in from out of town and met a friend here for breakfast. The bill for three people came up to less than $8. The waitstaff were friendly, the food good, and I would definitely consider stopping in again the next time I'm on Medina Square."}
{"text":"PLEASE READ. We were just there last week. The waitress at first was very nice and chatty, the cook even came over an chatted for a moment. At first we were feeling pretty welcomed and looking forward to a nice brunch. The food came out at various times as if it was being prepared one dish, one pancake at a time.?? This would have been ok but the timing of the food was between 5-10 minutes apart. There were 6 of us. So by the time the last dish was served, most of our table had finished eating. 
It gets worse. The waitress obviously was drunk at 11am. She kept sitting at our table making small talk. She wreaked of alcohol. My friend, who was visiting out of town, was quite put off by her because she \"shared something personal,\"...that she doesn't get paid to work there??? What? Why she felt we needed to know this became apparent when we paid the check. ( which she added up while sitting with us uninvited) We gave her $100 bill. The bill was $40. She took the money and came over and kissed my friend and sat down again. Really bizarre. Meanwhile we were waiting for our change. We wanted to move on with our day, as the whole meal took so long to be served.
She kept chatting at our table, while we waited patiently for our change. The cook came over again and started to dance. Which would have been ok, but we realized that they were trying to distract us from the fact that we had not received change, we were sitting next to the register. 
My friend spoke up and asked for the change. 
The look on the waitress face was like someone had ripped her off. Did she actually think we were leaving a $60 tip? Really. The cooks face went from friendly to not so friendly. WTF? We aren't stupid. Come on. 
She got up, finally, huffing and puffing, went and got our change. The \"friendliness\" ended right there. No thank you, have a nice day, nothing. You would have thought she knew us for years the way she sat with us throughout our meal. Yeah. No! 
It was quite obvious that we were being swindled from the get go. 
I'm pissed off and embarrassed that I brought my visitors there, and they had to witness that. 
Medina needs to shut this place down. I have no doubt that this is a common practice there. We will never be back, and I will be visiting chamber of commerce and notifying everyone I can. Medina square has come to far to have this crappy business ripping people off."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worse customer service I've had. Waitress took forever to refill my drink and by that time I was done with me meal. People in there are rude too. Arguing in front of customers. I will never go here again. I wish Marie's cafe was open when we decided to give this play a try."}
{"text":"My family comes here every sat and sunday and it is One of the best places to eat!!!  Best staff! Love the one cook, he always is in a great mood and sings. Food always perfect!! I highly recommend eatting here. I will definitely be back to eat!"}
{"text":"The best greasy spoon on the square, the staff make all the difference friendly and efficient"}
{"text":"We stop in every morning when home for vaca. They take debit/credit just to correct the last review. Eggs Benedict, 3.99... Come on that's a great price, especially for medina! I love it!!!"}
{"text":"We were pleased to stumble upon this diner in downtown Medina.  Very good breakfast and great value for the food. We will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"Couldn't tell you how the food is. After waiting 45 minutes from the time we placed our order, we gave up, cancelled and left. Giving 2 stars because our server was nice about it. Get it together guys, terrible customer experience:-("}
