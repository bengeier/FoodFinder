{"text":"We went here on my first trip to Calgary, hoping to scope out the town before moving. We were really looking forward to a brewery tour, but unfortunately it had been cancelled. They were super friendly about it when we asked and apologized. I was thinking I'd be intimidated by such a cool place, but nah, the folks there were super chill.   It's an awesome place to have lunch! There are several beers on tap that you can't get anywhere else (I totally recommend the Alberta Crude, even if you think you don't like dark beer, this one is soooo smooth and savoury). The music was an excellent mix of blues and rock a billy and get this - IT WASN\"T BLARING. Ugh, that's such a pet peeve of mine, when I go out to dinner or to shop and the music is so loud that you can't talk to the people you're out with.    The ambiance is great - there were young bro lookin' dudes there, some older couples, and some elderly lookin' gents at the bar. No one was obnoxious or anything, and the decorations - high vaulted ceilings with tons of interesting paraphernalia to look at - are really neat.   The food is pretty excellent and eclectic. I had pita crisps and a crab and cheese dip, my husband had roast duck with blood orange tortillas. Everything was delicious. We really want to get out there again for a date."}
{"text":"I apparently have trouble writing reviews for Calgary establishments, compared to the number I write for vacation spots. Time to start rectifying that imbalance!   In particular, I need to review Wild Rose Brewery before they have to close this location for good. They currently have their lease til Feb 2015 & are hoping to get it extended again. If they do not, you have to check them out before they shut the doors forever! I am sure the beer & the food will be just as fantastic anywhere else, but this small restaurant & tap room attached to their older brewing facility in the Currie Barracks has atmosphere they won't be able to duplicate.   Wild Rose is Calgary's best brewery (although the competition is increasing) & they serve all of their beers here on tap, plus you can buy them on site in bottles & in mini kegs called party pigs. Never have we failed to impress company when we open our fridge door & reveal our party pig, complete with a name tag & filled with the equivalent of 25 bottles of beer. Patterson is currently pouring IPA at our house right now. (They also have a program for larger kegs, but you need to order those ahead of time)  But this is definitely more than a mini beer store - they have a kitchen & full menu to go with the pints. Food is always good quality, although I must say I miss the black bean dip they used to have! The veggie chili is just not as good (strangely, though, my meat-eating partner thinks it is excellent, & has ordered it several times, so I guess it is just me) A few daily specials complement the set menu. Several of the dishes include beer as an ingredient & they will help you pair a beer style with your meal if you wish.   They also have beer specials - their \"seasonal\" brew will be available (also found in many local pubs' tap lists) as well as a featured cask conditioned ale on Friday, usually a special variation of one of their standards (last week was their brown ale with coconut & vanilla bean). The pour usually starts at 4 pm on Fridays, & there is rarely a seat to be found, so arrive early!   The inside of the tap room is a mix of small tables & larger communal seating with long benches. The regulars are quite friendly so there is generally no problem sharing. Some of the small tables are bar height, but there is plenty of accessible seating too. On one occasion, I witnessed someone in a wheelchair enter when the room was quite full, with only higher seating available, but a group immediately offered to move to it so their low table could be taken over by the newcomers.   Edited June 12/14 to include info that both washrooms are wheelchair accessible. I've only seen the inside of the women's, however :)   For me the big downside is location, not for atmosphere, but for ease of visiting. I wish it were closer to downtown so I could walk or cab there, as I hate making my designated driver cut his drinking short!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the beer is fantastic.  If you are planning a camping trip try the \"pig kegs\"... they are great, come in all the delicious flavours of beer.  Pig kegs are pre-tapped and are (i can't remember exactly) but I think around 30-40 beer so not too much for a weekend trip with friends!"}
{"text":"My first visit to the Wild Rose although I have enjoyed their brews for years. I took my lovely Miss for a pint and a bite. Velvet Fog was her instant favorite. I enjoyed one as well as the IPA. Shared the Brewer's Lunch. The bread, meat and potato salad were excellent.This was a perfect share for us. The other meals leaving the kitchen looked amazing as well.   The location of the building on the barracks grounds coupled with the walk from the parking lot to the door along the dirt path felt like walking onto the MASH set. Upon entering the quonset, the nostalgic feeling carried on.  Friendly greeting and being helped to a seat where two fellas kindly shared their table was really cool. The atmosphere was nice with lots of noisy chatter. The small room was at capacity.   Not sure if WR is like this all the time, but it is a place to enjoy a beer and rub elbows with other fine Calgarians."}
{"text":"I really liked to place. Decent beer and had reasonably priced food options and the options were fairly healthy conscience"}
{"text":"this is by far the best beer, the best best service in calgary!  my only suggestion is........... i with they would get a deep fryer! great beer deserves some unhealthy food :).  however the food they serve is fresh and great!"}
{"text":"I've introduced a number of friends - native Calgarians, recent imports AND out-of-towner's -  who all agree that Wild Rose is an especially unique brew-pub and a \"MUST-return\" destination.    I call it a destination because... it's beyond out-of-the-way; it's practically deliberately hard-to-find. With the south entrance to Currie Barracks closed last night (the one on Richardson Way SW by Mount Royal University) we had to enter from the East/Crowchild side and tell the security guard at the gate we were going to Wild Rose for \"just one pint\". You see... unique! (Who else has tax-payer funded bouncers?)  Co-piloting my friend down poorly lit roads past military vehicles we squeezed into a jam-packed dirt parking-lot. A full & lively scene welcomed us on a Wednesday night! It spilled out through the open overhead door onto the large concrete patio which was also brim-full thanks to a rare & treasured warm September evening.  Fellow Yelper's - Point of Information here: the building is called \"Quonset\" (not a barn, hanger, or shed). Wiki-link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quonset_hut   The ex-Canadian-Air-Force Quonset gives Wild Rose a 1-of-a-kind atmosphere (look for the trouble-light chandelier) which keenly matches the sites, sounds & smells of the machinery of brewing. This somehow lulls your expectations in such a way that beer, food, and even the service have you saying, \"Well, I didn't see that coming.\"  It's the magic of Under-Promise; Over-Deliver that has me coming back again and again and taking the time to share the love.   In a city of a million people, many of which suffer from \"Quadrant-itis\", it is worth the drive to this SW brew-pub from any direction. And for those who are GPS-less or directionally impaired, the cab-drivers know the trail to Wild Rose well enough. Besides - your car couldn't be safer overnight than being parked in the middle of a dim but still-functioning military base swallowed whole and now slowly being assimilated into one of the oldest 'burbs in Calgary."}
{"text":"Some of my earliest childhood memories stem from visits to the old WWII runways that used to cross the fields near the THEN Mount Royal College.     Long stretches of runway still remained decades later; and as a kid, I watched model airplanes fly from them, friends' go-carts putter up and down them, and various weekend car clubs racing and slaloming and doing static \"shine and shows.\"   These strips of concrete were just \"there,\" as far as most people cared.  Roads to nowhere without traffic to kill you.    But I do remember one day asking WHY runways nobody used somehow existed in the middle of the city....  and being somewhat amazed to learn of their military history (despite the more than obvious CFB Clagary, JUST OVER THERE)!  Amazed, because something I only knew as black and white war footage on TV, had physical ties to this place.     And everything here was most definitely real.  That \"making it real to me\" moment was profound as a kid.   I've probably been fascinated by war historiy and aircarft ever since.   So not surprisingly, I was sad the day I learned the runways were being torn up and removed.  As time moved on, though, I pretty much forgot all about them.  Years passed. Currie Barracks shuttered as an active base.  But thankfully, much of that past still remains -- almost as it always did, though with a new, now-commercial purpose.    And all of that makes the location--and the building that Wildrose finds itself in--so incredibly unique to Calgary.    Walking through the doors and having a pint here for the first time, those ties to the past are once again brought home.   I honestly could see a similar scene 60 years ago:  an officers lounge, or a room of newly trained pilots ready to ship out.  It wouldn't look much different then as it does now.  This has been a long way of saying:  I'm into the vibe, because there's more meaning here, if you allow it,  than you will find almost anywhere.  But let's face it:  the beer is great, which also  helps things along immensely!  More than a few Calgarians list WR as their favorite of any brew.  And the food?  I've tried only appetizers, but in each case, they surprised me by surpassing what I would have expected in a pub.  Unique and original in their own right.  This is something special to Calgary, and I'm a fan.  Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012 - 2/30"}
{"text":"I've come to pick up kegs from here in the past and wanted to try their food because it seemed like a very popular spot. So the other week I made my way out for a couple beers and dinner. I had the sausage with apple and onions as well as the curry slaw. My boyfriend had the mac and cheese. Both were amazing, even the mac, which I don't usually care for at restaurants, was some of the best I've had. The portions were just the right size, I didn't feel wasteful by leaving half my meal, but I was satisfied. My  only complaint is the seating is not very comfortable. I would probably not stay here longer than it takes to eat and have a beer because its so bright with the sun shining in and the chairs are hard. Plus we were packed at 1 table with strangers. I prefer darker places with comfortable booths if I'm going to be staying late."}
{"text":"I love it here. Delicious food (I mean REALLY GOOD), fantastic beer. This is one of our favorite spots on a beautiful day. It's just a shame the patio is sort of basically a fenced off bit of parking lot LOL. Would be nice to have something prettier to look at but really, my husband and I go there just to spend time together anyway. Just maybe not a place I would necessarily bring guests from out of town, or clients etc. despite the delicious cuisine."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a flight and meal and was glad I did. The place has some history as it is an old hangar of sorts converted and preserved from the old airport. I think I got that right?   Had the flight and would easily buy 3-4 of the beers again. They have a couple light entry beers and the raspberry fruit beer kills it on flavor. Their brown ale and chocolate stout were my favorite and both IPAs were a kick back from a hop bomb. About $19 CAD for a flight of 8 beers.   I had the ribs after at least 5 people asked if I wanted food and I wouldn't get them again. The flavor and texture was almost mushy and the bones were breaking in half. Over soaked in seasoning/ liquid? I don't know but I opted for another beer instead of more food.   The place was packed and crowded and akward for a solo traveler to find a place even at the smaller bar. They let me go back and give myself a tour which was cool as well. I'd come back for the beers but would pass on the food."}
{"text":"A must see for all Calgarians and visitors to the city. I moved to Calgary a few years ago and have been to Wild Rose more than anywhere else. The ploughman's lunch or any of their dishes with cheese (I am sure you couldn't buy the cheese in the grocery store for as much as you pay for the whole meal). The beers are great too. You can see the brewery equipment from your table and they sell little mini-kegs shaped like a pig."}
{"text":"We absolutely love the beer at WR Brewery!  We quite frequently pick up a Party Pig for party or get together.  It's a great idea, no preservatives and it lasts 4-6 weeks in your fridge!  Fave flavours are Wraspberry Ale and Velvet Fog!"}
{"text":"We dropped in for a casual dinner and we were absolutely blown away at Chef Robbie's new menu. The beef tartar was such a highlight - with the perfect balance of simple classic flavours and interesting textures. The session IPA is the perfect crisp hop to compliment the beginning of the spring summer season. Service was great. Ambience was great."}
{"text":"Excellent beer and atmosphere. The bartenders are typical in that they are always insanely busy and don't chit chat.  The clientele when I went were mostly low to mid 20's, probably because of the bar's proximity to Mount Royal College and the residences. Makes an old fart like me feel even older :|  I wouldn't hesitate to return; especially for their yummy beer!"}
{"text":"The beer was cold just like our server!we ordered the chicken wrap . It came without chicken so when we ask the server about it, she went too the kitchen and brought back brought a plate of cold chicken . I guess so we could make our own wrap. The wrap was dry and no source and I think there was supposed to have bacon but nope.  There was not a sorry or anything! I had too ask for the wrap too be taken off my bill. I would not  eat there ever again"}
{"text":"Whenever I have visitors from across the pond, I take them to Calgary's best.  And this is the place for beer.  Whether they are from Heinekenland or Plsen, they rate Wild Rose as 'damn fine beer.  Friendly staff.  And the food ain't half bad either.  The Wild Rose is a place that quenches, fills and entertains."}
{"text":"great beer in a very casual atmosphere.  Didn't have time for the food as I was just there for a quiet pint, but will definitely go back.  For those for whom Big Rock just doesn't cut it anymore (and that means all of the rest of the standard Canadian and American brews as well) this craft brewery produces real ale with FLAVOUR -- deep malts and bracing hops, head that lasts, complex tastes in each lovely mouthful.  I am not a fan of the fruit flavoured, lime infused, frou-frou beers - give me a good ale or a refreshing Pilzen every time, so if you are like me and enjoy a real ale, give it a try. I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"After a long day of travel my friend took us to the Wild Rose Tap House for beers and food. I am usually the guy that doesn't like \"different \" beers and usually stick to my go to favorites but I was forced out of my comfort zone here. I went with the Wraspberry Ale and it was outstanding! a slight fruit taste made for easy drinking. Next up was my food choice. My friend ranted over their pull bison but I just wasn't feeling it, I wanted to be more adventurous. I had the wild Vietnamese sub with bison. It was GREAT! , the right mixture of bread, bison, sauce and fresh garnishments. My friend had me try her pulled bison on a pretzel bun and I had her try my sub...needles to say she now has a new favorite on the menu. I was eyeing the fresh peach cobbler for desert but was too full. We might just need to stop back. Servers and bartender were very helpful and let you sample any beer you desired, cooks were jamming in the kitchen to familiar tunes signing along. I think we practically closed the place down. #bisoniswhatisfordinner"}
{"text":"I stumbled onto this place while staying for a night in Calgary.  It's a little out of the way and seems like you're going to a random shed when you get there but it was great.  I tried a couple of their IPAs and their bison brisket which was quit tasty! The staff was also very friendly! I would return here if I go back to Calgary."}
{"text":"Quite possibly one of the best breweries this side of the rockies, the Wild Rose tap house also has fantastic staff and great food. Make sure to get in for the special cask each Friday at 4 pm. Or stop by any time to enjoy the fantastic seasonal brews."}
{"text":"Amazing micro brew and the food is to die for, meaty chilli with an oatmeal stout. Yummy"}
{"text":"still a big fan of the velvet Fog, great local brewery"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place and decided quickly that I will return. I already know their brew is good and now I know the food is good too. I love the unique location of the place (in the Currie Barracks) and the atmosphere inside. It is unpretentious and simply a delicious alternative to standard fare."}
{"text":"They really helped out me and my friends with a last minute birthday party, even though we called an hour before (they request a day or 2 in advance) for a keg - they got it all done up within the hour with a big smile! and DELICIOUS AMAZING BEER!!"}
{"text":"Really love this out of the way brewpub experience! Chili is fantasmic and the beer is chilled and delicious. This is a great low-key environment for any event; date, lunch, late-night, foodies, etc.   Wraspberry is my fave summer beer and this place has to be my favorite place to drink it. I really like the casual atmosphere and the fact that this place is very out of the way, you're not going to stumble upon it so every one there is there for a reason: yummy hand-crafted food, brew tours, or the beer itself.   Not sure how a place like this was born in the area and managed to survive, but if more brewpubs start popping up in the industrial areas of Edmonton (my current locale) and are as tasty and affordable as this one, I'd def turn up!"}
{"text":"This is such an awesome little place tucked away in a great part of the city!  They have great beer and food!  Their seasonal beers like Cherry Porter are awesome!  And they have so many different kinds of food that it appeals to everyone you're going with.  Another great thing is there is plenty of parking, and the building is just so different from most other places.  Oh, and the prices are super reasonable. You have to try it!"}
{"text":"Awesome beer first off. Their party pigs made our vacation a huge success (even if it was a bit foamy). Love the Velvet Fog but the food is just mediocre in my opinion."}
{"text":"I've heard stellar things about this place and had some high expectations.  I was kind of let down by the food but I did try something very outlandish (some apple meat thing) so it could have been just a personal preference.  The location was so hard for me to find!!  But the setting was refreshing and novel, which was fun.  Waiter was nice and catered well to us.  I had a dark ale which was yummy but clashed with my dish.  I haven't tried their lighter brews.  Price was decent."}
{"text":"While beer is not my adult beverage of choice, the quality and the taste of the beers from the Wild Rose is undeniable. Yesterday, I had an opportunity to visit the taproom for a farewell lunch for a colleague and got a chance to sample their food offerings. One thing you have to know is that their kitchen has no deep fryer so although the team aspires to do \"pub food\", they have done an effective job at replacing those fried stables like ribs and french fries with options like coleslaw, baked beans and salads. The prices for their appetizers and entres are very reasonable, considering the amount of food received. I ordered the pulled pork sliders with a side of curried coleslaw.  The food was fresh, quickly prepared and most importantly delicious.  I washed down those tasty sliders and slaw  with a glass of their SOB (Special Old Bitters).  Be warned, you will not leave hungry.     It would be really easy for the group at Wild Rose to not give two cents about their food offerings as their real competitive advantage is their beer but fortunately for consumers, that isn't the case.  These guys care and it shows.   Highly recommended for beer sampling and tasty food while doing it."}
{"text":"Great food, fresh beer and awesome service. No TVs but I think it adds to the character of the place! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"After a long day yuppie-ing it up at the farmers market, you can come on out to this place to further your yuppiehood. Ok, enough of tha hate. The beer goes without saying, and the entrees? Two sausages, two cuts of bread, massive amounts of beans and sauerkraut for $10.50. Not super cheap, but it was totally a \"Calgary in year 2000 pricing!\" moment. Amazing.   You know what else is amazing? The lack of TVs."}
{"text":"From the other reviews I've seen it looks like I'm preaching to the choir but Wild Rose really is something special.  The product (that is, Wild Rose beer) is easily a favourite pour and stacks up well against the best beers I've ever drunk (and, for what it's worth, that's saying something).  Try: the 'Velvet Fog' - a cloudy wheat ale that is sure to be a top seller; 'Brown' - my own personal 'go to' pint, dark brown ale with lots of everything you expect in a brown ale... if you drink Big Rock Traditional (another Calgary iconic best brew), something like Sam Adams Dark or Newcastle, you'll appreciate WR Brown; or 'IPA' - a very fine version of the classic Indian Pale Ale that just ooozes with hoppy goodness.  Those lucky enough to get to Wild Rose can also sample from their seasonal tap of specialty seasonal pints that aren't widely circulated.  The tap room itself is a great pub room with a small outside patio that's well used in the Summer.  Food is well above average and is sans deep fryer... lots of fresh... lots of sandwiches, soups and salads... Meat Pies from the next door Farmer's Market; all are fine choices and well above the pale.  The room itself is on the smallish side (even with a recent reno to expand floor/bar space there's maybe only room for 50) and would be an EXCELLENT choice for something like an office party or birthday.    All together it's really hard to find a negative other than that it's not downtown... maybe that's a good thing though."}
{"text":"My favourite pub in Calgary.  Great beer, great service.  Delicious simple food (I particularly like their flatbread). I feel comfortable going there alone or with a big group.  I always order the brokeback (brown ale mixed with a touch of raspberry ale). Sitting on their patio on a warm day in Calgary is a bit of heaven right here in our midst."}
{"text":"Great micro-brewery.  Great place for a pint on summer afternoons.    The Brewery is in the Currie Barracks, which makes adds a bit of history to the drinking/dining experience.  The Brewery is located in an old Military repair hangar, which adds unrivaled cool factor to the place.  From the eating and drinking area there is a wall opening that reveals the taproom.  Very interesting place.  The beers are very tasty, very sophisticated in their flavour profiles.  The food is equally good, most of the ingredients are from the market itself.  The beer and the food complement eachother greatly, creating a very Albertan and organic dining and drinking experience.  Prices are reasonable, staff is friendly and passionate of their product, I recommend the Brown Ale and the cobbler."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, and great service. It was my first time there with my wife, so we each ordered a flight so we could try multiple types of their beer; and I think that's the way to go. The food was fantastic - I ordered the flatbread pizza with mango and spicy chicken and I would recommend it to anyone! Definitely worth a stop if you're in town!"}
{"text":"We had a great afternoon there tasting beer and picking one out for our wedding. Its Great that they have sizes that arent just huge. They were great about our getting it back after the honeymoon and all in all, I would go back for a keg or two of some of the other kinds as well."}
{"text":"I really dig this place. I have been here a few times and it never fails to put a smile on my face.  Perfect place to chill out with friends or a date. Food is consistently yummy, I have tried a few different things, never had the same thing twice and have never been disappointed with the eats. Tried the pulled pork sliders last time - we loved them. Loved them so much i got an order to go so my roommate could try them, he loved them just as much as me.  It's nice to stop in for the casked beers on Fridays, they start serving it at 4pm. It's always busy but I have never had to wait long for a seat. Last time I was there the patio was totally slammed, but I'm hoping to hit that up soon, it's west facing which means lots of sun.  I am also known to have backyard bbq's and fires, I am thinking this summer will be the summer of the party pig!"}
{"text":"Great place to relax in the summer. Nice patio. Unpretentious. Food is pretty good and last but not least... Great beer!   Velvet fog is a winner!"}
{"text":"Having called Calgary home for 4 years now, I've never been to the Wild Rose Brewery. Though I've always been a fan of their beer, WRB is one of those establishments I was secretly avoiding. The reason being everyone I know has had a great experience here and I was concerned that it wouldn't live up to the hype. I'm happy to report, its reputation is warranted.  We did take the tour and it was very educational. The host certainly seemed to know his stuff and indeed one does get a better appreciation and understanding of the process behind Wild Rose products. It also came with a half pint of beer and WR glass which was a nice keepsake. The tour cost $12 + tax and I think it was well worth it. If anything it was a neat way to kill 45 minutes.  I really enjoy the atmosphere. Though it's novel to see worldly beer bottles lining the tops of the walls acting almost as badges of brewing conquest and fun to watch the darts battles in the corner, I just feel at peace here especially after a  long day. Friends getting together in a pub where one can actually have a conversation in a sunlit atmosphere, delicious yet reasonably priced food and challenging your taste buds to try a WR beer you've never tried before. What more could one ask for?"}
{"text":"I love, love, love Wildrose.  The seasonal beer right now is the Wild Rose Cherry Porter.  If you haven't tried it yet, you should seek it out.  They describe it as the 'black forest cake' of beer.  How could you NOT want to try it??  Their regular lineup is filled with flavorful, unique beers - each one has a wildly different flavor - so you are sure to find something that appeals to you.  Here are my thoughts on a few of their regulars:  *Wildrose IPA - This is one of my favourite beers, and is definitely the best local IPA I've tried.  It is very hoppy yet drinkable.  *Velvet Fog - This one lays claim to being the first available unfiltered commercial beer in Alberta, which is hard to believe given the robust flavor unfiltered beers like this one can have.  I find this particular one to be more hoppy than fruity (I find many unfiltered beers tend to have more of a fruity flavor).  *WRaspberry Ale - This one is a fruity, tart beer that is perfect for a sunny day.  Or a cloudy day.  Or a snowy day.  It used to be a seasonal brew, but it became so popular that they now produce it year-round.  *Brown - This one is an easy drinking brown ale which has a refreshingly clean finish.  If the beer alone doesn't bring you here, they also serve up some excellent food.  Last time we were here, we shared a few plates along with our samplings of beer.  The Brewer's Lunch had a wide assortment of cheese, meat, salads, onions, pickles, etc and was served with bread made in-house.  The bacon-wrapped skewers were delicious as was the garlicky hummus and naan.  At times, part of me wishes that they were more centrally located so that I could have a more convenient place to imbibe.  But their location has character, and you really don't want to change that.  Keep up the good work, Wildrose!  Review #16 of Yelp's 30 Day Review Challenge"}
{"text":"Hard to find but worth the effort. Overall solid beers but access to a cash beer starting at 4pm on Friday was a highlight. Pink belly was very pleasant as well."}
{"text":"Wild Rose Brewery was the perfect break in a touristy day in Calgary, separating a visit to the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame and heading downtown for the nightlife.  The current brewery is just southwest of downtown (as I understand it they are expanding with an additional location), and the place has ambiance all-around.  Housed in a small hangar/fallout shelter, the building has character from the get-go, and continues to get better with a sizable beer garden and interior hall.   Although I was slightly bummed to find out prior to my arrival that Wild Rose was no longer offering tours, I was still strongly encouraged to check the place out based on the beers and the food.  Even with the highly enthusiastic recommendations from the staff at the hostel we were staying at (I always have concerns that a highly-set bar will lead me to at least some level of let-down), this place did not disappoint in any fashion!  To start, if you've never been here before, grab yourself a flight of 8 of their beers, including 7 of their flagship brews and their seasonal.  That'll fill you up with just over 3 pints of beer!  Continuing on, order some food.  This is a great spot for lunch or dinner.  If you've been conserving your beer samples appropriately, you'll be able to do some beer-food pairings.  What were some of the highlights?  The filling \"Barracks Brown Ale Stew\" went perfectly with their brown ale of the same namesake, while the \"Brome Lake Duck Tacos\" were a perfect match for some of their lighter brews...I personally thought the \"Velvet Fog\" wheat and the \"Wraspberry Ale\" raspberry ale complimented the blood orange-roasted, cranberry-topped duck perfectly.  Whether you're just popping through Calgary as a stop on the way to Banff National Park, an oil and gas tycoon that's in town for work, or a local that loves a good brewpub, Wild Rose Brewery is a must-see (and a must-eat, and a must-drink...well, you get the point)."}
{"text":"I'm the designated driver these days. Flat bread was great."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great service. Great beer. And great food. The perfect place to enjoy beers with your friends.   Nice spot to get away from the overloaded bars in downtown Calgary. I went on a Friday night, and I had no troubles getting a table. Try sitting at Craft on weekend evening."}
{"text":"Walking into this brewery, I didn't know what to expect... But was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere! I really liked that you can see into the brewery from your table.  Our waiter was super nice and helpful. I asked him what I would enjoy based on my taste preferences and he brought me over a couple different samples of beer.  My friend and I ordered the Hummus & Naan for a starter - it was a huge portion of dip compared to the Naan given but was full of flavor.    I ordered the veggie flatbread for my main dish and let me tell you... It was great! I love flatbreads and sometimes I get disappointed at places, but not Wild Rose! Definitely coming back for another pint and some food."}
{"text":"Love me some Wild Rose Brewery! Local? Check! Good food? Check! Kick ass beer? Double Check!  I have been drinking Wild Rose brews for a long while now.  I couldn't even tell you when I first discovered them, but I have been loving them for years.  Special fondness for the Wraspberry, Velvet Fog & recently the Cherry Porter (& am sad that I had missed it all these years.)  Their brewery location serves some fantastic food.  The chips & three dips is a steal of a deal. Also rather impressed with their chili. Throw in a few pints of beer and you have a pleasant afternoon on your hands.  Especially if you manage to score a patio spot on a hot day.  If it weren't for the fact that it is so difficult to get a spot when it's busy & that I have found service to be hit or miss, this would be a solid 5 stars."}
{"text":"Every friday my gal and I swing by the WR hangar for our \"Quittin' Time\" beer.  Mine is generally the cask (a special cask-conditioned iteration of one of WR's extensive line-up of regular and seasonal beers) if there is any left, or an SOB (I love a good Bitter); my wife usually defaults to her favourite: Velvet Fog (a beauty of a wheat beer).  The food is good--but the beers, atmosphere, and people are the best!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go to get a real 'Brauhaus' feeling.   The food is good and the atmosphere casual. We have been here and listened to classical music as well as on 'normal' days to have one of their own beers.  Personal favourite beer: Alberta Crude  Beer to go: Try one of their Party Pigs. It is a 8.5 litre keg of beer which looks like a pig."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, but has nothing on the Alberta Crude - Oatmeal Stout, it's like heaven that comes by the pig!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I finally made it to Wild Rose for dinner. I've been meaning to go for some time based on the reviews. Maybe it was the food that I chose to order, but WRB was very good, but not great. The experience is different here, the space is wide open, and the crowd seemed to be an older bunch that most likely live in Garrison Woods. The staff was friendly enough, and service was pretty good, as was the food.   We ordered the pistachio crusted goat cheese, which is served with crostinis I thought were too crisp. My friend had the veggie chili for dinner, I had a bite and it was just ok, but I'm not a huge chili - especially veggie chili - person. I had the crab cakes and they were huge, but seemed rather heavy and I would have preferred it if they were crispier. Both the appetizer and the cakes were served on greens but they lacked any dressing/flavor, otherwise I would have eaten them. Of course, the beer was great.   I'm glad I tried this unique place out, but living downtown I would probably save the trip and go some place closer to home next time. When my beer enthusiast step-father comes to town again, I will definitely bring him here."}
{"text":"the food is alright, limited choice, but then it's not really about the chow here is it?, but the beer, well that's what I'm talkin'  about baby!! I love the fact that you can buy a pig of beer too and take it home!! SO awesome!! if the food was a little better it'd be a five star pub"}
{"text":"I ate there yesterday for a corporate gig. With my job I eat at all kinds of nice restaurants and catering. The food was phenomenal top tier for shizzle! Staff were amazing as well!"}
{"text":"I once stumbled in to this place on a frigid winter evening in Aught Seven, looking for directions to a Roller Derby tournament that was taking place nearby. They gave me the wrong directions, but I made a mental note to come back and try their brew (if I survived the swirling blizzard!).  Fast forward to 2011 and not only do I get to try their potions, I also get to see how they craft them! The environment is friendly and unassuming. Our tour host was awesome, really knew what he was taking about and didn't hesitate to say that on a night out with his wife he'd still order Wild Rose beer. I've been a longtime fan of their Wraspberry Ale, but drinking it straight from the source has now spoiled me for buying it anywhere else. You have to try it from WRB. Or plunk down 90 bones and fill up a Party Pig so you can pull yourself a pint straight from your own fridge. Is having your own keg excessive? Maybe. Am I filled to the brim with Wild Rose Propaganda? Definitely :D. *waves hands* You will not buy cheap beer anymore. Ooooooo.  Oh, and the food here is good too! Must come back another time to try out their veggie chili. This time I won't wait another 4+ years."}
{"text":"Somewhere along the way I had a beer from Wild Rose. I don't remember what it was or where I had it but it was stuck in my memory bank. Visiting Calgary I knew I wanted to hit it and was I ever happy I did so!  It's in an old hangar where a lot of the patrons know each other and the staff. Everyone was friendly with us. We ordered a couple flights and most of the beers were really good. I really, really liked the Blonde Ale. The Oatmeal was also really good. These were my standouts but you can't go wrong with the IPA or Brown or the sour.   We did have a pretzel - make that two - while we were hanging out (they were perfect). If we had more time we probably would have spent another couple hours there. It was a really enjoyable experience all the way around."}
{"text":"I've read such good things about this place so I was pretty excited to check it out last week. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed.   The place is tucked away on the old Curry Barricks. It's a bit of secret location. I thought I might need a secret password or knock to get in the door but nope, just pull the handle and you're in.   This place doesn't have much for ambiance. So if you're looking for something special, this isn't it. To be honest, it reminded me of the caberets we had back in the day in Saskatchewan. They were usually held in some boring community hall and had nothing but long tables and some uncomfortable wooden chairs. Wild Rose was pretty much the same thing. Not much here for interesting decor other than the big brewery thing behind the wall of glass.   The food was ok but nothing to write home about. The macaroni and cheese was ok but I have had better. The baked brie cheese in phyllo pastry was good.  I had the Wraspberry beer and it was very tasty and that's about the only reason I would go back.  I would certainly have this beer again and would also consider buying it in the store. Everyone at our table enjoyed their beer as well. I'm giving Wild Rose 3 stars because it's about the beer here."}
{"text":"I realize that sour beers are still relatively unchartered territory for breweries in Alberta. So I give this brewery credit for being one of the first here to get into the game. However, they still have a long way to go. I drink sour beer often in the States and was excited to see it offered here, but the Cowbell Kettle Sour here tasted much more like a gose than a true sour. I couldn't bring myself to have more than a few sips, as I really dislike gose beers. I hope Wild Rose is able to work on it so that people here can appreciate the true taste of what a sour beer should be.   Outdoor seating area is nice and umbrellas offer shade. Can't comment on the food."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. We crossed this one off the Calgary bucket list today and I must say that I was not so impressed? It was a Sunday afternoon, I know, not a good time to go and drink a big pint of beer (now sleepy!) but this was the one plus about this place. The pint was tall and cold and I am not even much of a beer drinker. Got the Wraspberry one. (no spirits here, beer and wine only) Service - embarrassingly bad. No hello, no goodbye, no checking on us as we ate. The place was not very busy. I felt like I was in a cross between a garage, basement and a barn. However, that said, the place is for sure unique and it was very clean, even the washrooms.  Ordered: Pretzels - yummy, hot, salty and fresh with interesting mustards on the plate. Crab cakes - worst I have had in a long time. Looked good and had decent crunch but were all bread filler. Beef and Barley soup - not so good, the broth was watery and the barley was all clumped together in a sloppy ball. No meat. Odd! Meatballs Sliders - meat not so fresh and lacked sauce and cheese. All in all, if you like Wildrose beer and are not concerned about food or service this is the place for you. Do not expect to find TVs here to watch Ottawa win the Playoffs, there are none! Would be hard pressed to return."}
{"text":"Great beers. Inviting atmosphere with a cool patio. Try the pink velvet. It's a clean and crisp mix between two of their most popular beers. We loved it."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!  Not only is the beer fantastic the food is too! There is a beer for everyone, I especially love tasting the feature brews and seasonal brews. Super friendly staff, fun environment, a very cool place to chill. I have yet to be on a tour but I LOVE that you can see the beer masters at work well you enjoy their labor. Just fantastic!!   Cheers! www.bristolcleaning.com"}
{"text":"I must add to my previous review after attending a Co-op Beer Dinner at WR. If you've never been to a Beer Dinner, I recommend them. They are usually around $60 for five courses and five beers.  Now here's where it gets interesting. I always really enjoyed the food at Wild Rose, finding it complimentary to the beer and relatively healthy. But the menu at the Beer Dinner revealed the Wild Rose chefs to be nothing short of genius. These guys are capable of much more than they are letting on. That said, I have seen some of their more unique creations start to creep their way into the standard menu.   The beer dinner consisted of Velvet Fog steamed mussels and clams, roasted SMOKEY butternut squash soup with bacon paired with IPA (mind blowing), mushroom and goat cheese salad, and then an unbelievable Alberta braised short ribs in demi-glaze, roasted winter squash, cabbage, and baked polenta. This all finished with a cherry porter trifle; light, and full of cherry flavour with smokey notes. It was simply outstanding.   Keep your eye out for this event in the future! With any luck, even more of these awesome menu items will crop up on their standard rotation!  Normal menu rotation must-try items: Blue cheese field greens (if you're into blue cheese), Alberta crude oatmeal stout (on a cold day), salmon gravlax, Brewer's lunch (come hungry)."}
{"text":"I came back to Wild Rose again for a Yelp Wrap up party which really, was just a reason for all of us to get drunk and stuff our faces with jummy food once again.  I've had Wild Roses' popular beers like the Raspberry and the India Pale so this time around I settled for their seasonal Cherry Porter which was soo good I had it thrice. Great, Wildrose brewery you made me say \"thrice\" and I abhor saying that word.  We all shared Wild Rose's appetizers. I like their nacho platter which had beans, salsa and  cheesy dip neatly placed in a bowl which was a nice alternative to the usual \"dump everything on the nacho\" goodness other pubs strive for. We also shared several of their fresh pretzels which, when I made a blasphemous joke about \"breaking bread\" was divinely punished when I underestimated the hot mustard and it crawled up my sinuses. Finally, I had their \"craft\" mac and cheese. It was delicious. I'll leave at that and leave out the part that it was cheesy goodness finished off with an amazing baked crust permeating a tasty smell that interrupted Carol K mid-speech several times.  Lately, I've been closely observing the service in these places I've been going past the surface level of their pleasantness, but in how they seem to enjoy their job. Everyone at Wild Rose seemed to love what they were doing and wouldn't shut up about the food and beer. Our waitresses were lovely and witty, and Andrew was cool enough to ring the massive bell and buy the house a round of drinks.  Also a side note: I ran into a co-worker of mine whose family was allowed to celebrate at the Wild Rose, who appears to allow minors only before 7pm :)"}
{"text":"You know how I feel about Wild Rose Brewery? Proud.   Now, I haven't done anything to deserve this pride. It's not my business. I don't even know the owners or any of the people who work there. I'm just your average customer. But I like their beer so much that I actually feel pride when I tell people they're from Calgary. Wild Rose Brewery, it impresses me how much you impress me.  When it comes down to it, this is the company that sparked my own personal beer revolution, empowering me to toss off the shackles of big brand beer and explore the endless craft beer universe and I've never looked back. Ever.  S.O.B. - You sunnuva bitter, so special and old. Smooth, delicious, and mellow enough to have at your side as a party companion for those all night sessions.  Velvet Fog - You know, I honestly think if it wasn't for the name, this could be the most popular everyday beer in the city. It's flavourful, refreshing and would have huge mass appeal. While yeah, it's \"velvet\" smooth I think it gets perceived as girly... it's not! Fellas. Drink this beer! Call it a \"Fog\" if it makes you feel better. It makes me feel better... Actually, Wild Rose, can we please just call this a \"Fog\"? Us Alberta boys can get a little insecure about these things...  I.P.A - Industrial Park Ale before I even knew what an India Pale Ale was. So you want to get into the hoppy world of IPA's? Wild Rose is a great place to start. It's got enough of a  great hop-kick to the face to be a real IPA (the Keith's your drinking is a lie!), but is still mostly approachable by many novice beer drinkers. It's inviting, and will open your eyes. If it's a bit much for you, order a pretzel to go with it. The pretzel grease helps take the hop edge off. Seriously.  WRed Wheat - ...meh...  I don't really drink this one, actually. *shrug* You can't win 'em all. :)  WRaspberry - A very berry flavoured summertime classic. Have a significant other who doesn't like beer? Here's your real raspberry getaway vehicle from those horrid alco-pops.  Brown Ale - Nutty, chocolatey, and one of my preferred fall beers.  Alberta Crude - as the weather gets colder, my beer preference get darker. In the deepest depth of winter the toasty malts of this oatmeal stout keep me warm inside.  Ooh ooh! Are you ready for this? I AM!  Cherry Porter - The Wild Rose winter seasonal... Ok. THIS is why you need to drop what you're doing right now and get down to the brewery! The fruit flavour isn't light like it is in the WRaspberry. Ohhh no. Think deeeeep cherry, like stewed cherries mixed with dark chocolate. THAT is the Wild Rose Cherry Porter.  Now that we've covered that, let's move on to the food, shall we?  The Food - Yah, it's good.  The Place - I love taking people from out of town here, because I'm proud of it, yes, but also because just as they are convinced I've taken a wrong turn we roll up at the old airplane hangar at the Currie Barracks. I love how the brewery is always a destination visit and you can't just stumble in. I don't like how you can't just stumble home. Someone always has to behave themselves. *sigh.  Seriously though, the food is really well thought out and totally delicious. I've just written enough for one evening. Go see for yourself."}
{"text":"I went recently for a relative's birthday party. Service was really good. Our server had no issue splitting the tab among coming and going guests. The brewery let us bring in a cake and didn't charge us for using their plates. Totally recommend this place for large get-togethers.  I've always liked Wild Rose beer, but their special beer cocktails were fantastic. I never would have thought about blending one beer with another, but it works. I enjoyed the blends more than drinking a regular Wild Rose beer.  The food I tried was good quality. Food was like a home-cooked but better than you can make yourself. Portions are on the smaller side, and no fries are served, which is better for you anyway."}
{"text":"Menu is straight out of the 90's pretty boring even for pub style food, and it wasn't really even that good either. Wouldn't recommend eating here, maybe just a beer."}
{"text":"We were invited to join my son and his girlfriend for a few beers on her birthday. The place was packed and it took a little while to get our group all seated together.  We shared a long table with about eight other people.  The beer was marvelous, the service was a little slow, but the staff had great senses of humor, The food was delicious!  We will definitely go back, but will likely pick a week night for a better seating choice.  The Velvet Fog goes down great!"}
{"text":"The only aspect of that Wildrose Brewery that is less than stellar is the location. It isn't exaclty easy to get to if you don't want to drive, and when i go to a brewery/restaurant I like to have a few pops. So there is the negative.  The positive is pretty much everything else. Located in a building that looks like it was once a hangar or something similar, it is pretty spacious inside with a lot of stainless steel and a clear view of the brewing area.  With seasonal beer along with their classic line-up, you're likely to find a beer you will enjoy, but keep in mind Wildrose tends not to brew too many lagers and light beers.   The food....to be honest I can't remember, but I've been told I liked it and I hear rave reviews from many friends about the chili.  If you ever need a drinking buddy to accompany you to Wildrose, let me know, I will bend my schedule."}
{"text":"It's kind of far away, but worth the trip! The food is simple, but it tastes fantastic... and wow huge portions! The spinach dip was basically a meal for two people! The atmosphere is fantastic, especially outside on a nice day and the wait staff were all very kind. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Place is always well worth the trip.   Great regular beers and often something different to try as well.  Staff and the regulars are always friendly."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure today of taking part in a brewery tour, and I must say I was extremely impressed!  VERY impressed!  In November, I had a tour of another brewery outside of Calgary. and I will say that it did not have the same \"heart\" and \"passion\" about its product that I saw at the Wild Rose Brewery.  Forgive me of not mentioning the name of the competitor tour.  I'm not looking to bash the competition on the competitor's yelp page.  :)  What is clear to me is that Wild Rose Brewery has a great product with a lot of heart.  Many of the technical details were lost on me, but some of the details that did stand out are as follows:  1.  They are socially responsible.  Our tour guide explained how they have a relationship with a local farmer and they give their grain bi-products, still full of nutrients, to the farmers as feed, at no charge.  Its a win- win.  The product is still full of nutrients, so it is still useable and the responsible thing to do.  The animals eat it and the farmers benefit from the donation.  Also, it saves wild rose the cost and the additional process of disposing of this grain.  Those types of win-wins make my heart sing.  2.  Again, technical details are lost on me, but our tour guide was explaining the process of moving the beer from one big copper vat to another at different stages of brewing.  What stood out for me, was that he explained that the hot water that is used to heat the beer in one vat, is transferred to the the other vat when completed to use again, because it takes less energy to keep hot water hot, than to heat cold water in the second process.  One of our tour members asked if they did it to save money.  The answer was no, because they pay a flat rate regardless, so the cost to Wild Rose Brewery is the same.  In other words... they do it, because its the RIGHT thing to do.  Again... tingles of happiness.  Due to time constraints this evening, I did not have a chance to sample the menu, but I certainly will be back, with friends to do so.  Wendy P., fellow yelper, and our Community Manager for Yelp made a number of recommendations that I am looking forward to going back to try another time.    I`m a huge fan of lining up to support a company with so much heart.   I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"I don't usually eat meat or drink beer, but their brew was fabulous and I couldn't believe how amazing the beef panini was. Great atmosphere too. Our server was adorable."}
{"text":"\"OK MAGGOTS!!  I ORDER YOU TO DROP INTO THAT SEAT AND DRINK A BEER!!\"  screams Drill Seargent Beer-y McBeer-a-lot. ....   \"ummm....ok,\" i reply. \"UMMM....OK, WHAT?!?\" ....  \"ok, sir?\"  i'm scared at this point.  I then drink my beers with a straight back, fresh crew cut, and military precision.  ************************ Ok, it wasn't like that at all, but when I went to Wild Rose Brewery with my sister, Ari G., we were surprised to find this cool brewery in a military Quonset hut.  I was prepared to drop and give the beer maiden 20 push-ups if I was so commanded....as long as a Wild Rose Sampler soon followed!  The location definitely makes this brewery/pub unique!  It was a nice summer day.  The roll-up door was rolled up, and we grabbed a table inside---although the patio seating outside beckoned.  We liked it in here.  The joint was busy, but chill.  Loved the old B&W military photos.  Also liked looking at all the foreign beer bottles displayed around the dining area (we liked looking for breweries we'd been to).  On to the beer---with names like \"Alberta Crude Oatmeal Stout\", \"S.O.B.\", & Wrasberry Ale, I knew I was in for a creative treat.  I, of course, went with a sampler.  My sister maid me look like a pansy and went with a tall cold 20 oz. pint.  The beers were oh so tasty, and helped throw us into the festive spirit of our fellow Albertans.  We were also lucky to meet Calgary Yelp Ambassador Wendy P here.  I wish I tried her beer concoction:  1/2 Wrasberry Ale & 1/2 Velvet Fog (sounds scrumptious!).  For a beer sponge, I had a plate of pulled pork sliders.  They were ok, nothing to Yelp about.  They served their purpose and helped soak up the alcohols.    It was cool to find a cool brewery like this in Calgary.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"A - List. Highly Recommended. Not Just A Place For Beer - Superb Beer. Amazing Food (definitely not your regular pub food!!). Excellent Pricing. Very Cool Space. Friendly & Folksy Atmosphere. Absolutely No Plasma Televisions Anywhere!!!!!!!! Woot Woot! If you have friends coming in from out of town, take them to the Wild Rose Brewery in the Currie Barracks, next to the Farmers Market. It is one of the gems of the city!!! AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"It's fun because of what it used to be. Now it's all new staff, new menu, different beers brewed elsewhere. But strangely the regulars are consistent. This is why I continue to appear here."}
{"text":"Really, really, really good. Never had a disappointing meal here. Usually the service is impeccable, though sometimes three servers can be overwhelmed by a full house (since the rebranding). I love this place, and come here often enough so I see how consistently above average their food is and how friendly the staff remains, and last but not least, how beautifully refreshing the beer is."}
{"text":"We order party pigs from them every year at least at Christmas. The deposit is expensive but it makes sense. We still have our party pig and its been almost a year. As long as you bring it back in good shape you can either get your deposit back or trade for a new party pig and just pay for the beer.   When picking a beer for your get together the staff are knowledgeable and will let you try them first. The velvet fog is a popular pick and seems to please the masses. You don't get much better than fresh brewed beer in your own mini kegs.   The pub also has some not bad food. The last five years that we have ordered beer from them I have picked up a meal to go or we ate in. The food was pretty good for pub food and the staff was always very friendly.   I look forward to picking up our beer this year. If you are having a new years eve party or a holiday get together or even just a party with friends than pick up a part pig. Your friends will thank you."}
{"text":"Wild Rose is one of those restaurants where I can keep coming back, time after time.  I'm not a big beer fan, but I do like Wild Rose's selections. The Wraspberry is my favourite but they're pretty good at recommending \"mixes\" that I might like as well.  The food is always excellent - I have yet to order a meal that I'm disappointed with. And, even not being a red meat eater, there's tons on the menu that I can eat, including a vegetarian chili (not many places offer that!)  The patio is awesome in the summer, although the restaurant can get pretty packed and it can be difficult to find space to sit.  Definitely a must try if you haven't been. I need to try a tour next!"}
{"text":"My family and I are huge fans of breweries. While on a road trip this summer, we stopped at several breweries in the western US and in Alberta. This was, by far, our favorite of the trip, and personally one of my favorite breweries period. Every beer I tried was delicious but I especially loved the raspberry beer they had. It was a perfectly balanced beer and delicious on a warm day.   We also tried their pretzels, and a couple dips- all of which were amazing.   I hope to visit Alberta again someday, and if I do, Wild Rose is on my list of places to go."}
{"text":"What a spot!  The girlfriend and I came here after a quick 9 holes of golf at richmond green. We grabbed a seat on the patio and the server provided us an umbrella as it was super sunny.  We had some grizzly paw soda (we both weren't drinking that day) - black cherry and ginger beer (epic sodas!) and then added the nachos (huge portion), plus pulled BISON.  They didn't skimp on the sour cream or salsa and even had reasonably sized to-go containers.    They were $22 nacho's all-in, but they were worth it.  I will be back to sample other food options!"}
{"text":"The must-do stop in Calgary, Alberta. Draft beers brewed on the spot, lots of bbq lunch choices. The ribs are top-notch, but you really must go for the Brown Ale Meat Pies with beef, gravy, veggies. I haven't had meat pies in years because I was never a fan, but I am now because of \"Wild Rose.\" I enjoyed the Wred Wheat Beer with a shade of burgundy tint, but I loved my second beer even more, the Velvet Fog -- I don't know how, but that's the perfect name for it. Smooth like velvet, has some kind of foggy, misty and sudsy finish that is just an incredible original. Last, I love the wide open factory feel that lets a lot of cool breeze in. Outdoor seating, too."}
{"text":"The beer and food here is deliciously amazing! However if you get a party pig/crowler to take home make sure you drink it soon, or else they start leaking a little bit. Not a deal breaker, just slightly inconvenient :-) But then again, who would keep tasty beer like this for long enough to leak?"}
{"text":"My absolute, 100% favourite thing to do within city limits in the summer is to take a spin around the farmer's market and then settle down in front of the Wild Rose Brewery for the afternoon. Great beer, warm sun, and lovely location in Currie Barracks... Yeah, I'm pretty sure there is nothing better. Any food can be gotten in the market, and there is a good crowd that likes to hang out in front.  Of course, the sheer quality of the beer helps. The seasonal brews tend to be interesting and nuanced, but their normal brews: Wraspberry, Velvet Fog, and Wred Wheat Ale are probably the most prolific (and all of them delicious). Wild Rose reflects so, so well on Canadian beer making techniques, proving once and for all that we are one of the best beer countries in the world.  I think it should be a requirement for all Calgarians to at least visit the brewery, but there is nothing like a cold, expertly crafted microbrew to throw a summer day to the next level. Go Calgary for sweet, sweet microbreweries."}
{"text":"The best microbrewery in Calgary and for sure one of the tops in Canada (yes, even better than that *other* Calgary brewery).   It's great to see Wild Rose embracing their air force hangar location (down to their newest ale AF23 named after you guessed it) as well as all their beers.   WR specializes in ales, do not go here expecting anything approaching Canadian (but really, you wouldn't be here if that was the case). My personal favs are the Alberta Crude Oatmeal Stout (think Guinness) and Wild Rose Brown (think Newcastle). However, there are beers for every palette.   In addition to the beers, there's the food which is more often than not, made with the beer. Plenty of meaty and vegetarian selections for all diets.   Last, there's the swag, party pigs (a great idea for a BBQ or house party) or even a keg to take home.   We're lucky to have such a great brewery that has such helpful, knowledgeable staff. For example, the last time I was here the server helped a grouchy old couple who didn't read the menu and only wanted a \"light beer\" to share make their decision and they (and all of us sitting by them) were happier for it."}
{"text":"I enjoyed our visit to Wild Rose.  The location is fun, beer is interesting and worth trying different kinds, and the food is a great fit for the types of beer that they brew.  My favorites were the brown and IPA, but the porters are a nice change as well."}
{"text":"Great beer decent service and the food, meh.  I've loved Wild Rose beer for many years, and had a fun time visiting their brewery before it moved to the Curry Barracks location. I have yet to experience a tour in the new location, I'm sure it's great!  I've gone during the day and evening and find that at times, even when it's not busy, that it can take awhile to get served. The servers are friendly when they come around, but I do have a problem with having to wait more than 10 minutes with a table full of friends with empty glasses.   I do appreciate that you can get a tasting of beer to decide on what you want to get a full pint of, and that they have different pour sizes. The quality of the product is outstanding and the seasonal brews are always something to look forward to.   Now, the food. There are some yummy appetizers but the fact that you can't get things on the menu changed at all because they are already made is frustrating, and I personally don't like to think of my food as being \"pre-made\". The salads could use something more for the dressings, they have always been too bland. The toppings are great, but if you don't top it off with a great vinaigrette then I might as well be eating plain lettuce at home.  Overall a great place for a pint and if you like appetizers you'll be a happy customer, maybe even more if you head home with one of their \"pigs\"."}
{"text":"The beer here is amazing, I have always been a rasberry fan but the cowbell is my new favorite! One of the best beers I have ever had. And after a few you mix it with rasberry, mmmmmm.   And then the food, just as amazing. The smoked meat sandwich is as good as any in Montreal. The smoked meat flatbread is equally awesome. The problem with the food being so good is it takes away more room for beer."}
{"text":"Go discover the genuine spirit of this brewery and have great beer and food, but don't tell anyone else. Lets keep this hidden gem in Currie Barracks to ourselves :-))"}
{"text":"I've not been a fan of the typical microbrewery gastropub experience, wherein food quality and value often take a back seat to the beer and to the maintenance of a faux-casual urban chic vibe (a vibe generally reflected in menu pricing).  WRB, however, is an exception to this in many ways.  First, the ambiance is fully unpretentious,  This converted army barrack is about two-thirds brew plant and one-third taproom, and the latter is unassumingly adorned with beer bottles and related paraphernalia (the way a dorm room might be decorated, I suppose, though that comparison really doesn't do this place justice...).  I won't pretend to be a beer aficionado, but I've had four of the WRB brews (Wraspberry, Wred Wheat, Brown Ale, and Velvet Fog), and have enjoyed them all enough to appreciate the hype about this local brewery.  That's pretty much all I can say about the beer itself, and I likewise can't say too much about the food (since I haven't had a full meal here yet), other than that the three appetizers we shared were far better than I'd expected them to be, that the menu appeared extensive and well thought out, and that this appears to be a popular place to dine.  For me, the kicker at WRB is the tour of the brew plant.  I had done a few such tours prior to the one here, but I can say that, for whatever reason, this was the first time I fully grasped the brewing process in a way that left me with a greatly enhanced appreciation for what beer is and how it should be experienced.  (One interesting aspect about the tour - about which I feel ambivalent - was the way that our guide, though a series of rants, played out a battle between the humble, well-meaning typical microbrewery and the malevolent large-scale industrial beer manufacturing powers, accusing the latter of various forms of unsavory and deceptive manufacturing and marketing practices.  While this was entertaining, and perhaps educational to a point, it left me curious to learn more and hear the other side of the story...)"}
{"text":"97 reviews? Well, here is one more!  If there's one menu item that you need to order, it would be the soft pretzel. It's so good and so worth it.  Came with a few other Yelpers for a UYE and we had a great time. Nothing like kicking back a couple of pints on a Sunday afternoon. When you first arrive at Wild Rose Brewery, you may question whether or not Google Maps took you to the wrong place. This place has the one of the most unassuming places to have a brewery.   Enough about logistics, let's talk about the beer. One of my fellow Yelpers got the \"paddle\" which seemed like a great deal and a great chance to explore many beers at once. I've had plenty of Wildrose beer before so I wanted to try out some of their seasonal flavours (which were great!)  Will be back. For the beer and the pretzel."}
{"text":"I was quite impressed with this place, I'd heard a lot of good things about it but never ventured in. As an Albertan I'm always happy to check out local breweries, and I've had Wile Rose beer before and boy is it tasty!   Trying to find this place if you've never been is a bit tricky... it kind of feels like it's in the middle of no where but it's definitely worth it once you find it.   We came on a Saturday afternoon and it was packed, we were lucky to find a table! They had a lovely assortment of beers on tap including a couple I'd never heard of before (cherry porter). We sat down and order some beers and lunch and had a great time.   The food was delicious, the atmosphere was fun and the beer was good... need I say more? I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Wild Rose Brewery, how do I love thee? I'd try to the count the ways, but I'm afraid I won't ever be able to stop. From your tap room to your tours to your staff who are so obviously passionate about your product, if I'm not heading out there for a pint, you can rest assured that there's some Wraspberry, Velvet Fog or Alberta Crude in my fridge to tide me over until my next visit.  Faves in your tap room: Pink Velvet - it's half Wraspberry and half Velvet Fog. The Best Wurst - how can you go wrong with a plate full of sausage, beans, sauerkraut and cabbage? I have a hard time finishing this one. Meaty chili - wow! The first time I tried this I couldn't quite understand why there was a chili pepper on top... until I took my first bite. It's got some kick, and it's one of my faves.  What is the best occasion for Calgarians to visit your tap room? Why, every occasion! I've been here for birthday parties, group dinners, lunch with friends, meetups with yelpers, post frisbee drinks, brewery tours etc. It's amazing food, drink and atmosphere with better-than-reasonable pricing.  Heck, I've even taken a couple of your party pigs houseboating. They're fit just perfectly into those little fridges :). Whatever your magic sauce is, keep doing it! Cuz it's got me coming back for more."}
{"text":"Oink oink... party pig?!   Yes please!  What is a party pig?!  It's a pig full of beer! 25 glasses to be exact!   My coworker received a pig (Analise) as a present!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yM__QJKXtvLM_KFH-kpSlg?userid=-gzH91WI8-RphjXAfuR8xQ#CircZ7HR5G2lwbS2vScZig  Cost is $50 for a full Pig + $40 refundable deposit Two options when you're done: EXCHANGE - Bring in your empty Pig and they'll fill it or give you another Pig for $50 RETURN - Bring back your empty Pig and they'll refund the $40 deposit  Located in the old Curry Barracks this place is a hanger/ barn/ garage looking thing in the middle of no where with a gravel lot and chain link fence I felt like I was driving through a desert  and came across this watering hole / oasis! hahah.   Love the atmosphere, garage-y feel, Fermenting bins in the back behind the bar. Prices are reasonable. Food is good - soft pretzel, nachos,  Good beer selection. Patio outside the garage for those nice hot days."}
{"text":"Great beers, and often new variety. The food is excellent also (I think they source most of their produce from the farmers market). A great place to relax and its location next to the farmers market is ideal."}
{"text":"The beer it's all about the beer! Wild rose is truly a business that has risen from the ground up.It's a beer fairy tale, a living breathing fairy tale that not only inspires me with their unique business model but puts real pride and love into their products. It taste amazing!   I have been a fan of wild rose since I first tried their beer. Velvet fog is truly one of my all time favs! But pretty much all across the product line each beer that they brew will certainly satisfy beer lovers anywhere! From the Alberta crude to their very popular Wraspberry they keep it pretty tight and don't get carried away with to many flavours. The tight product line is one of the more solid on the craft beer market. They don't make no junk at wild rose!   In the summer I had the pleasure of taking the brewery tour and enjoyed a very nice dinner after! The food overall was quite tasty and fairly priced, but let's be honest as nice as it is to have a decent restaurant inside the brewery I don't come here for the food, I come for the ultra fresh brew!   If you love beer or even just learning about new things I highly reccomend coming for the tour. It's a quite homey operation that takes its self seriously where it counts ( the beer) but is otherwise extremly relaxed and laid back which I personally love!   One final thing to say about wild rose, the beer is potent it will go to your head a little faster than most! And according to the guy who gave the tour it's not a higher alcohol content than average it's because they don't use preservatives so it actually absorbs much faster. Just so you know 2 pints of wild rose is like 3 pints of standard swill ( aka Molson or bud) really good bang for your buck! Come and enjoy!  9/30"}
{"text":"Velvet fog tops my list of favorite wheat ales so there's something sexy about drinking it right where it's brewed. All their beer is naturally brewed with no chemicals or preservatives and maybe that's why it just feels right to try a few every time I'm here. Sitting in the sun on the patio drinking beer and tasting quality bites doesn't get better then this spot. I highly recommend the marg. pizza and fish tacos."}
{"text":"I finally got around to actually staying in at Wild Rose, as opposed to popping by for a six pack when in the area.  Last night I ended up at Wild Rose for dinner with a pal around 7. It was bustling and friendly and warm, but not so busy that we couldn't find a table to sit, glad we went earlier on a Saturday night. Upon sitting down, I asked our server about the seasonal ale for the autumn, and she brought me over a taster of the Marzen. I ordered said brew immediately, and it came in a 20 oz mug with a handle. It felt majestic or medieval or something. But mostly just cozy. This Marzen was a delightful little lager. Copper in colour, crisp and clean, but at the same time warming and somehow toasty.  Additionally, I ordered the veggie chili, and subbed out the jalapeno cheddar corn bread (I've heard it's amazing, but alas, I don't want the vegan police up in my grill). Instead, our server brought me two nice slices of foccacia bread with the chili, which was wonderful. The chili was tasty, alllll kinds of beans, including green beens, which I liked because I am not a fan of just kidney beans. I would definitely order it again, but I noticed there are also other veggie friendly things on the menu which makes me happy, that it is not the only option. The menu prices were very reasonable, a pint of beer and my order of chili rang me in to about $15. My pal had some greens (as a general rule I don't eat most salads in restaurants because I make them better at home. Plus I hate how everyone thinks that is the only option for vegans), and the Potato, Cheddar, IPA soup which she claimed was delicious, and this is a picky eater/drinker who haaaates IPA, and comes to Wild Rose only for \"the raspberry one.\"  Angelo already brought this up, but I adore how Wild Rose does not have deep dryers in house. I feel like this challenges the conception a lot of people may have about \"pub food.\" I can tell their menu is very intentional, and pairs well with all of their microbrew offerings.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Considering how many reviews there are for this place, I feel like a big loser for not having been here prior to this afternoon to enjoy food and beverages.  There were only two empty tables when I walked in, so clearly a Sunday afternoon doesn't slow them down.    I had my favorite, the WRaspberry Ale, which was brought out in an unexpectedly gigantic glass.  Wow, they don't mess around here.  I sampled a few starters, being the chips and three dips (I couldn't get enough of the chilled jalapeno cheddar dip or the brown beans), hummus & naan and the pretzel with slap you in the face dijon mustard.  Also, something happy occurred while I was there as well because someone rang a big bell behind the bar and then before I knew it, the house was buying a round for everyone.  Woo hoo!  I then tried the Cherry Porter, which was quite delicious and thankfully in a much smaller glass because I thought I was going to explode.  I had a very full belly at this point.  The servers were casual and friendly and it was a very comfortable atmosphere.  It might be out of the way, but Wild Rose is worth the drive."}
{"text":"I wish this place was in range for a \"quittin' time\" beer. Seriously, the only complaint I have is that this place is tucked deeply into the former Currie Barracks. So no 1 am staggering home for me. Which is too bad, because the beer is amazing, like mind-blowing great, the staff is friendly, and the menu has the best pub food in Calgary. The best summer hang-out and an excellent place to take people from out of town.  Also, they could clean the patio a bit, but I say NO. This is Wild Rose country, we don't need no fancy wanna-be Irish pub patio. The concrete tables and mis-matched chairs suit me just fine, thanks."}
{"text":"We buy kegs of beer from here for our stampede parties as well as those little piggies for use at the office.   I like the beer and the pricing is good but actually sitting in the brewery for drinks is loud and packed. In the summer you eat dirt from the highway.   The food isn't good at all and there isn't much vegetarian to choose from - but that's what you usually get in YYC.   I'll stick to big purcahses from here....or a quick beer posssibly. Not a place I would hang out at regularly or for much time."}
{"text":"As far as ambiance and atmosphere go, this is probably one of the best pubs in Calgary: it is a unique location, with a unique look (umm, yeah it's a brewery in a BARN) and an uncommon menu. I am pretty sure I had a burger with some interesting things in it: off the top of my head, I can only recall that it was filling and satisfactory. We went on a lovely summer evening, near sunset, and I felt very content with the world. I am waiting for summer to arrive so I can go again!"}
{"text":"i LOVED the wild rose brewery! i loved that it was in the middle of nowhere in a building that looks like an old garage. i loved their stout and i thought their meaty chili was kick ass.   the wild rose was just what we were looking for when we got into town. highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Impromptu Sunday afternoon visit with friends to Wild Rose included a fantastic hot spinach dip, a coconut curry prawn bowl and white lagers! The DJ spinning vinyl had my friends and I singing along and playing name this tune."}
{"text":"This place is cool ... But not fancy at all... But the wine was not bad and the service very friendly. I am not a beer person, but most of my friends like the beer here... This is a great place to go in a group for a different time..."}
{"text":"The Wild Rose brewery makes great beer and great food. I'm a huge fan of the Wraspberry ale, which is perfect for the summer. All of the food on the menu is full of flavour and very reasonably priced. It's a shame that the Calgary Farmers Market is no longer near, but it is still worth going to the Wild Rose brewery for a trip of it's own. The patio is also a nice touch for enjoying your beer and food for summer."}
{"text":"A bar on the Currie Baracks?  You heard right!  Wild Rose Brewery is situated right in the middle of Currie Barracks, right across from the Calgary Farmers' Market.  What a strange and perfect place for a microbrewery.  Okay, so locally brewed beer aside, let me tell you a couple of interesting and different things about this place.  Wild Rose Brewery actually offers tours of their brewery, a tour that allows you to see behind the scenes, learn about the fermentation process and sample different beers!  Each staff member knows more about beer than any other person I've met, aside from other staff members.  They are usually fun people, who enjoy educating us about one of man's greatest drink:  BEER!  They have great specials on their beer, since it's brewed right there!  And they have a surprising amount to choose from.  I'm a huge fan of their Wraspberry ale!  It's so sweet and tasty, I think of more like juice than beer!  Among others are Velvet Fog, Wred Wheat Ale, Brown Ale, IPA and Stout.  It's nice to support a local brewery with locally brewed beers!  Have I mentioned their Party Pig yet?  This is a mini keg, holding approximately 25 pints of beer, which they rent (or sell) for any occasion.  Whether you're having a party, or just want a little kegger in your fridge, you can get the Party Pig for only $50... full!  It's a great deal... and it actually looks like a little pig!  Party Pig!  Hehe!"}
{"text":"With the recommendation for the mac & cheese here, I thought it would be worth a visit. They were right. It was a delicious treat and the beer was excellent.  It was a great beer and good food, but why don't you have wifi? I would have stayed longer, had another starter and another beer to go with it, but not if I can't check in on Yelp. I was bummed about it.  Note: the place is easy enough to find, once you realize that it's buried on a former/current army base. When you come off the road, make the sharp right."}
{"text":"SO great. Velvet Fog. So good. If you haven't visited Wild Rose, fake a cold and leave work right now.  For real.   So exciting to have a local company that produces so many solid products and the environment of the brewery itself is fantastic."}
{"text":"I've never had service like they provide at Wild rose brewery....it's unreal how attentive, efficient and awesome the staff are. A group of us went for some grub and beer, and at no point in time were any of our glasses/pints empty before a server came to ask how we were doing.   Velvet fog and Barracks brown are my favorite.  The Montreal smoked meat flat bread is tasty!!  Kind of in a random place, but definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"It is impossible not to give Wild Rose Taproom 5 stars because their beer is so darn good. ... the fact that they serve food as well is just a bonus on top of those 5 stars.  I don't want to compare, but when I first tried a Wild Rose beer, I could not believe the flavour I had been missing out on (unlike some other Calgary breweries, which shall not be named).  But making a visit to the Brewery/Taproom is an experience in itself. Set in (what seems to be) an airplane hanger, the bar of the taproom looks RIGHT into where the magic happens, so you can watch a Master Brewer hard at work while you sit and enjoy the delicious labour of his hands.  I have had the pulled pork sliders, the jalapeño Mac & Cheese, the curried coleslaw and the Oatmeal Stout brownie. All very good! Like I said, it is all just a \"bonus\" to go with your beer.  On our visit, Jessica and I had the pleasure of seeing them boiling (is this the right word for this?) the hops while we enjoyed our meal.  Aromas of what smelled like cut grass or green tea filled the space with it's rich \"farmy\" deliciousness.  I had seen breweries before, but this was the first time I had seen the brewing in full action. Quite exciting.  It is nice to be able to see first-hand how one of my favourite breweries (ever!) produces it's fine product. The fact that I can go any time, watch it happen and enjoy a tasty meal is priceless."}
{"text":"We are regulars for the past couple years.  I love the fact that there are no TV's.  You can actually talk here.  There are big tables so you can meet interesting new people.  Food is wholesome and service (especially Geoffe) is prompt and courteous.  You have to go and visit just to see the lighting and the wall chart, \"Perodic Table of Beer\". Oh yes, another surprise, go often and become their \"friend\"!"}
{"text":"I visited the taproom last night. We all got flights, my husband didn't love all his beers but I really liked mine, and so did our friend. We were going to stay for dinner but there are signs disallowing minors after 7p, and we had our 14mo daughter with us. I don't begrudge them that policy, I personally feel as though kids should be out of breweries by 7 but we were killing time before a red eye flight so had to have her with us. The sign says no exceptions but we left just before 7 so I don't know how much it's enforced. It's a nice place to spend some time in good weather."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong with drinking any Wildrose product and their Brewery itself is a treat. Nestled away in the Currie Barracks, where this is basically the only thing left other than defunct military housing, you will find the source of Wildrose power inside an airplane hanger.  My favourite part about actually visiting the brewery, is their food! This kitchen is boss and they don't have a deep fryer, so everything you get here is ovenbaked or stove top cooked. It is also neat to see how they utilize their own brews in the cooking process. It's also a big bonus cause WR Wred Wheat is my favourite beer and to find it on tap in this city is ridiculous. So come, drink your WR favourites, enjoy the food, go on a tour, pick up a party pig (they name each one individually) and relax in this cozy beer haven."}
{"text":"This place is fun!  It looks like a barn and almost feels as one, but service is very friendly and useful, portions are huge, menu is interesting (I mean - not common), and obviously there was plenty of beer to taste.  I was brought there by some local friends and totally enjoyed the experience. Nice place, worth returning, just don't expect it to be some sort of \"restaurant\" or such - it is a brewery, and a darned good one! :-)"}
{"text":"I have recently discovered a mixed beer they serve - called Brokeback This is a blend of their WRaspberry and Stout.   It is my favourite beer.  I've also discovered the salmon gravlax on flatbread instead of the bagel they typically serve it on, and it is so tasty."}
{"text":"How is it possible that it took me so long to finally go here?  BEER SAMPLERS - 8 little beers, all different brews! My favourite thing! BREWERS PLATTER - plate full of meat and cheese and pickles and bread and potato salad and roasted garlic! Also my favourite thing!  I love this place!  Super well priced, cozy, good service, and you can take a tour of the brewery, which we didn't do, but next time for sure!"}
{"text":"I hosted a 30 person event here, and there was plenty of room. They were fast and attentive, their lunch was delicious and upper scale. We had some last minute vegan orders which Chef quickly prepared to their delicious satisfaction. They quickly and discreetly took drink orders and refills. Everything was ready on time.   I am certified with the Beer Judge Certification Program, and the beers I tasted here were to style (aroma, body, mouthfeel, and overall), and they were delicious. I can see why this is a favorite hangout for locals.  I highly recommend hosting events here - they can seat 80 people."}
