{"text":"Clean bright restaurant.  Have never had a bad meal here.   Sports Bar atmosphere, but not overpowering.  Very friendly staff and owner."}
{"text":"complete POLAR OPPOSITE FROM MY LAST VISIT. Great food, good service. Average prices! I had the double grilled chicken BBQ burrito. The entree had a little too much BBQ sauce. But aside from that it was very tasty!! Too bad it closed now :("}
{"text":"Not much good to report tonight.  Food was decent; the wife had cajun pasta, which she said was okay, but not warm enough.  I had the hot meatloaf with mashed potatoes, which I liked; but the missus tried it and hated it.  The appetizer, which came out AFTER the salads, was buffalo chicken dip and chips, but it was mostly chicken salad, buffalo style.  The waitress acted like she was in a hurry to go home, and kept ducking out the side door to grab a smoke (very classy).  The coup de grace, though?  There was a Pens hockey game on, NOT ONE tv, out of a half dozen, had the game on.  Now, the game started an hour after we got there, or I would have walked out much sooner.  Never again, Chicks."}
