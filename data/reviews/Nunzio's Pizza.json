{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick bite to eat after the MJ Tribute.
Service was really awkward and not friendly. By the cashier and the manager. I ordered chicken parmesan with a bread stick and soda. Food came out fast and it was just okay. Pasta sauce was nothing special. The portions were huge which I appreciated because it was about $14 for the whole meal. And the bread stick was wide and literally a foot long. Definitely a sharing portion. The chicken itself was flavored nicely and had the potential to be good but it was sitting for such a long time that it was sooo soggy. I wish they at least threw a pre made chicken into the oven to stay crispy but instead it was all just sitting there soaking up marinara sauce.
Overall it's a decent fairly priced place to eat. And you get what you pay for. Portions were the best part of eating here."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Walked by this joint after the comedy club, ordered the combo special that included one extra large pizza, side salad and a soda for $11.99. The extra large is literally a quarter of a whole pizza. Ordered the white pizza and it was nothing short of delicious in every aspect. The crust was soft on the inside with a slight crisp from the flakey outside. The cheese tasted fresh, not too greasy! I ordered a cheese and spinach stuffed shells. Some of the best pizza I've had in Vegas! Great quality food in a hole in the wall joint. Definitely visiting again. The caprese salad was fresh and the portions were very generous."}
{"text":"We ordered the 11.99 deal. Got pizza, pasta and some more dishes.
The dishes were ok, nothing great. The pizza was somewhat chewy and the pasta seemed microwaved out of a ready to eat frozen meal."}
{"text":"this should be at the ground floor, because this is what people want. this and sometimes chinese takeout... but this italian stuff comes first of course, so don't keep it a secret please"}
{"text":"Bottom Line: This pizza is nothing special, but if you're hungry, being cheap, lazy and in the stratosphere...it works! and then you can go right back to your room :) 


Food: 2/5. The pizza doesn't have much flavor but it IS a big slice. That counts! It's filling... and very quick! They do have a variety of flavors. Pizza plus soda water for me cost less than $10- so you won't be breaking the bank as much as you would at other places on the strip.

Service: Very quick! The staff is very friendly and accommodating as well. When I went after a day party, there wasn't much of a line. 

Not a fan of: The temporary re.... maybe it needed to be reheated more? Lol"}
{"text":"It's not too uncommon to find \"by the slice\" pie shops anywhere you have a steady flow of intoxicated hungry people.  My girlfriend and had just left the viewing area of the Stratosphere roof and noticed this spot and decided to save some time and effort and just grab something to quick before getting ready. As we looked over the menus and displays the two staff members up front seemed reluctant to great us and tried not to look in our direction. We placed our order and somehow paid somewhere between $15-20 for one slice and a salad (no drink) after which we waited around 5-6 mins for our order. Not great or particularly good but not terrible. It was a good portion size and saved us from an expensive dinner on the strip which seems what this shop is here for."}
{"text":"The food was ok. They do offer a good deal for 1 slice of pizza a side of pasta and a drink for $12. The pizza is very bland. The cheese breadsticks are not cheesy at all. When i asked for parmesan cheese the lady ( marinia?) argued with me until she finally gave me two packets."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I have had has been in Vegas.  Unfortunately, Nunzio's didn't quite make the cut.  It was fine for what it was...cheap pizza when you're starving or drunk.  However, if you have time to find something else, I'd suggest doing so.  I mean, you're in Vegas where there are so many options.  We ordered a couple of pepperoni pizzas for our group.  Some of us enjoyed it more than others. To me, it took way too long to deliver a pizza that basically had no flavor.  On the upside, there are coupons all over the Stratosphere for specials so you won't pay too much for either the whole pie or a slice. It's also conveniently located if you're shopping, seeing a show, or headed up to or down from the tower.  If you're just stopping by the casino, it's a bit more difficult to find.  Just not my favorite but perhaps it will be yours.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A little pizza and sandwich spot in the stratosphere.  Nothing to go all out crazy for.  Three of us all had calzones,  picking out our toppings took a while, drink selection is small.  Overall quality of the calzones surprised me.  Small personal size, made to order.  Larger Calzones would clearly take too long.  Almost went back a second day, but ultimately decided to try something new."}
{"text":"So when I got off the observation deck I was really hungry and wanted a quick lunch. I got the vegetable slice and hubby got the pepperoni slice. It was horrible tasting but admitadly edible. The only good thing was the veggie toppings. Even the hubby pepperoni was awful. Yes they are HUGE slices but still not worth the 6 a slice. Maybe 4 a slice to be reasonable. I should have held out for something else"}
{"text":"Located on the retail level of the Stratosphere is where you will find this establishment.  Upon walking up the pizzeria you'll notice the display cases (various pastas and the baked wings in the first, several pizzas in the second, and various salads in the third).  The display cases with the dishes under the heat lamps is not a good look and makes the food look old and/or dried out.  

 Service was ok, small issue with the ticket machine not printing my order to the cook so it took an extra 10 minutes to recieve my food.  Staff did appoligize for the inconvenience but a little frustrating nonetheless.

  I recommend staying with the basics of pepperoni or cheese for the pizzas and the build your own Calzone is a great value and in my opinion the best dish in this pizzeria."}
