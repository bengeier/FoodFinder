{"text":"Ordered online at 6:07pm received my order at 7:40. 
Slow service for take outs. 
I did dine in a couple of times, the service and food was really good. 
But for sure I will not order take out from this place anymore."}
{"text":"Good quality food and taste amazing . Better than fredrick or any other hakka restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"The fried rice are tasty and not too spicy. We tried the Singapore and Thai fried rice and like both. The beef is a little dry and the chicken is better. Good value esp for their lunch special which includes egg roll and pop. Waitress was friendly too. Keep in mind this is more of a take out / fast food setting seating wise."}
{"text":"We first tried Hakka King with a Groupon and loved it so much that we came back two more times in recent months.  They have very reasonable lunch specials for $6, but even their entrees from the dinner menu are excellent value.  Portions are very generous, and the food has just the right amount of spice and heat!  We love spicy food, so this restaurant is perfect for us.

Recently, we came for a birthday, and the servers were so kind and friendly that it inspired us to write our first Yelp review.  Simran was our server, and she was very good at recommending dishes, advising us that any of the dishes that are marked as Chef Recommended [CFR] are worth trying.  She also mentioned that the Chef has cooked in India for a number of years.  We tried the Bombay Mutton, Manchurian Tiger Shrimps, and Chili Chicken with gravy.  The mutton was delicious and spicy, and there was a complexity to the sauce that we loved.  The tiger shrimps were also huge and spicy!  The chili chicken was crispy, and the gravy was very good with onions.  Each entree came with its own complimentary scoop of rice which we appreciated (since most Chinese restaurants tend to charge for rice).  

At the end of the dinner, we were very surprised when they brought out a slice of yummy cheesecake with a candle for the birthday person in our party!  Not to mention, the birthday person got their entree free.  Overall, the great service and delicious food makes Hakka King one of our new favorite go-to places for Hakka food."}
{"text":"Ordered Hakka King on UberEats. We had the vegetarian Cantonese chow mein, chicken balls, general tao chicken, and vegetable fried rice. The chicken balls and general tao chicken had a terrible after taste as if they were deep fried in old oil. The taste and everything was there but the after taste killed it for me! The vegetable chow mein and vegetable fried rice was okay. The food would have been amazing if it didn't have that weird after taste!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend as everyone raves about this place.  We shared Kung Pao Chicken, Szechuan Beef and the Mixed Manchurian Fried Rice.  Spicy and fresh, but low quality meats.  The beef was quite chewy.  Also, tried to ask about ingredients, as my friend has a gluten sensitivity.  They had no clue what I was talking about.  Overall, I've had better."}
{"text":"Place was great for years, then something or somebody changed and now it's no good.
I went back after two years to see if they returned to their high quality, but they had not, so, never again."}
{"text":"I really like this place! The chicken pakora is really good!!! All the dishes are very flavourful and there is enough rice to go with each dish. I think if you check groupon they usually have a deal so make sure to bring that!"}
{"text":"We happen to be in the area last Sunday 09/10/2017.  We were craving for chili chicken, but we also were willing to try a different resto for it.

We ordered : N8 Hakka Chow Mein (sweet), CH5 Chili Chicken (Dry) & FR1 House Special Fried Rice.

Service :  was a bit on the slower side at the time of our visit (around 2pm) only 1 person covering the dining room and what appeared to be only 1 cook in the kitchen.  Upon sitting we were given a glass of water each (room temperature), I had to go to the counter to request a glass of just ice.  Later in the meal I also went to the counter to request a pitcher of ice water.  The girl serving was still pleasant and courteous.

Food : the sweet hakka chow mein was good we would rate a 3/5.  It was really dark in color.  The chicken used in this was breast meat, since it was really dry.  The chili chicken - dry version, we would rate a 2.5/5 overall.  There wasn't enough spice heat in the dish tho the nuggets of chicken themselves were tender.  As for the House Special Fried Rice we'd say 2.5/5.  Nothing super special about it, not enough shrimps and the squid pieces were cut too small.  The chicken in the special fried rice was also breast meat..since it was also dry.

As a note on spicy heat, the chili chicken isn't spicy enough at Hakka King. There was spicy heat, in my case as well as my wife, we would say the spicy heat would be about 1/5 for us.  At China Cottage in comparison we would rate the same Chili Chicken - dry we would give their version 3/5 for spicy heat.  We still enjoyed the dish in the end, for a milder experience..since neither of us had to guzzle down water to put out any flames.  If you happen to be looking for a Chili Chicken -dry experience that you need to reach for something quenching to put out the flames I'd say look somewhere else , or use the chili condiments to mix with the chili chicken.

As for repeat visits, yes we would go back, to try other dishes.

I would rate Hakka King as $$ for couples (walking out full for $11.00 - $30.00)  For per head rate $ ($1.00 - $10.00) is a bit harder to determine since Hakka King at least time of our visit didn't seem to have any lunch time combo offerings for weekends.  

As for method of payment, they accept CASH, DEBIT.  Uncertain as of this writing on Credit Cards."}
{"text":"It's tasty deep fried food no doubt. We order tAke out from here too. I'd love some fresher/healthier options. The chilli paneer is good and has this really spicy red sauce.

What would make takeout more better is fortune cookies :p"}
{"text":"Before reading this review, I don't mean to be an A--hole so I will only write my experiences and how they happened, you be the judge...

I've given this place 3 tries in the past 6 months, all strikes in my books, here goes.

#1
Tried the chili chicken lunch special, took it home to eat.  Portion was much smaller than Federick's and just didn't taste very good, also there was a long grey hair in it, like from an old woman or something, I had pulled out of my teeth, disgusting.

#2
They advertised that they delivered so I let the hair strand in my food slide.  I ordered at 530pm on a weekday, ordered the chili mutton, fried noodles and some spring rolls.  I ordered by just calling them, not from JUSTEAT.ca.  I live fairly close and would expect the food to be here as quick as a pizza, 45 minutes.  By 630 I was getting hungry, I called the restaurant and they promised me the food had just left the door, GREAT!  Food will be here in ten minutes.

LIES!  I waited ANOTHER 45 minutes and I get a phone call from the delivery person that he's outside.  I do apologize for getting angry at the delivery person, it wasn't their fault, I was just venting and I hope he conveyed my anger to the owners.  I had ordered the food at 530 and it arrived at 715, no phone call they were going to be late, no apologies, no discount, nothing to acknowledge their F-ck up!  Chili mutton was good so I let this one slide yet again.

#3
Knowing that last time my order took almost 2 hours to deliver even though I live like 2km away, I ordered again, this time, at 930pm using JUSTEAT.ca website this time.  At 933pm, literally 3 minutes after putting in my internet order, I received a confirmation email that the order has been placed.

The website says the order will be delivered within 45 minutes, wonderful!
at 950pm, I get a call from the restaurant saying they JUST received the order, WTF, is it really that busy on a weekday close to 10pm?
They called at least this time but to say the food was going to arrive at 1045pm, an hour and 15 minutes for chili chicken, chili mutton and Manchurian chicken? Seriously?

This is the LAST straw for me, I gave them 3 tries and all were bad experiences although different.  

Chili mutton tastes great, but due to the poor execution, communication and lack of management, I will not be recommending this restaurant to anybody.

Happy Eating Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here with a groupon. 

I'd never heard about Hakka Chinese before coming to Toronto, and this is actually my only 2nd time having it, so I'm by no means an expert. I did think that this place is pretty comparable to Frederiks 

I liked the food. My favorite was the chicken pakora. Dishes are about $8-$12 and are pretty big. I think they come with rice. I think the value was good, even without the groupon. 

It's pretty small (just a few tables), and is more casual than Frederiks. 

10% discount for takeout (not sure whether you need a coupon for this or not)."}
{"text":"This is a mom and pop restaurant that is on the plaza across from Costco.

The service at this place is really slow because there is only one staff (aside from the kitchen chef). The staff had to take orders, clean up tables, pick up phone orders and bringing out the checks. It is very inefficient and a normal lunch on a weekend can take you more than 2 hours (for just 2 dishes).

The good thing about this place though is that it is very cheap. If you combine with a Groupon, you will be only paying minimal amount for 2 people. 

The food are mostly Chinese, with Indian style spices to generate Hakka food. Though, there is too much sauce in this dish, so your noodle is pretty much soaked with sauce.

I wouldn't recommend going to this place unless you don't mind the wait and you want something really cheap."}
{"text":"Place is nice and clean. Not very busy since most people line up to go to federicks next door. We stumbled in here because federicks was full and there were no tables for 45 minutes. Got a table here right away. Staff were super friendly but only 1 server was available/visible on a Friday night between 8 tables. The food was bmhorrible. No taste, no spice, no flavour! Fried rice tasted very similar to steamed rice. Pakora had no taste - not even salt. Chilli chicken didn't look or taste anything like chilli chicken. We regretted not waiting for our table at federicks every moment we spent in there. Hopefully food quality improves in the future before they lose all customers."}
{"text":"Will definitely go back with a Groupon deal, not sure if I would for regular price. The food does the job if you are craving hakka food. The service was great, staff were extremely friendly and bathrooms were clean (if you care)."}
{"text":"Ordered some takeout the other day and the Chicken fried rice was very bland and tasteless. The hot and sour soup was the worstt hot&sour soup I've ever tried, I felt like I was drinking soy sauce :/ I had to throw it out. The chilli chicken was okay - not horrible but not the best. I'm obviously not going to order from here again."}
{"text":"Nice little place, Indian and hakka options on their menu, one of my new favourite hakka place.

Have already been twice here....plus delivery."}
{"text":"Food was OK (Bombay chicken, chicken fried rice, and Manchurian beef), was dissapointed on a Sunday night where we were told our food was going to take 20 minutes. We were willing to wait, however it was disappointing to find out that we couldn't order any Pakoras or appetizers due to having one chef that day and they can't make them, I suppose due to the many orders. The place was fairly busy too so we were waiting for our food for longer than 20 minutes. Waitors tried their best but only filled one of the three cups (there was three of us), then we had to ask for more water. We tried to flag down a waitor for our bill."}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-3
Service-3
Food-4
Strikeouts-0/3

When I first walked in, it felt like a place where you sit down to have a quick lunch and go. I didn't like the chairs very much. They were hard to sit on. lol 

Service was a bit slow. We went there during a weekday for lunch and there was just one person serving us. Many times I had to get up from my seat  and walk to the counter so I could tell the waiter my order.

I'd say food wise, everything was pretty mediocre, but I would say  it's one of the better hakka restaurants I've been to. My favourite was the paneer curry. That was amazing. Too bad it wasn't part of the special lunch menu.

Overall it was alright. I think next time I come to eat would be if I am in the area to grab the lunch special."}
{"text":"Purchased a groupon for this as I was feeling like some Hakka food. Got their chili chicken and shrimp along with a fried rice dish. Quantity was great. Taste was so-so. If you use a groupon, I dont think you'd be disappointed. More than enough food for two. Was pretty empty when we went for a weekend dinner. 2 stars because of the really slow service - waitress taking order needed help from another waitress for almost everything we were ordering."}
{"text":"I have ordered from then once online and the food tasted good. What turned me off is when I tried to order them for a second time online on a separate occasion. Just like the last time my friends and I ordered a couple of items to have it delivered to our address and waited approximately 30-40 minutes. After waiting we decided to call them to see why it was taking so long to have them tell us that we clicked 'pick up' and the food was ready. We were then told it would take an additional 20 minutes to arrive, which then turned into an hour wait. It became evident that either the website was having an error or they did not realize the order until we called and needed to cook and deliver it. It was poor customer service to try to blame the customers for their fault and the food is not worth the lacking customer service."}
{"text":"I really like Chinese luncheon specials with my favourite Hot and Sour soup and chicken / rice entre. It was a mistake to come here. The food had minimal taste and the soup was a major disappointment.
Service is minimal. Never will I return."}
{"text":"Mediocre service and speed of food coming out was slow.

Out of all dishes order only 1 was decent which was the chilli paneer.

Beef and chicken dishes are way to saucy/watery.

Overall there are better options in the area."}
{"text":"Hmmm Hmmm taking the gamble of ordering Hakka King over Fredericks paid off well.
This small unit is well laid out, clean, and their service is up to my standards.  You'd be surprised to hear that they have special promotions every week. For example,  if you purchase one order of Chili chicken ($8.95) you get the second for $5!!!  It's essentially a sweet deal that no one can refuse. Another promotion that Hakka King has available is their $30 gift card that entitles you to $50 worth of food.
We had to make a quick pit stop for more food, so it was a no-brainer to try out their dry chili chicken. This dish was a solid 4/5.   Just be sure to advise them to make your order mild as their spicy can get REALLY SPICY.
The Portion, price & quality was worth it and I'll be back to try some of their popular dishes."}
{"text":"Food used to be good, but it's gone down-hill over the last 2yrs. No wonder they have to use Groupons to get customers.
Service has been decent consistently, but the food has been erratic since Fall 2015. The waitress suggested that their chef quit, so they brought in a new chef.

We've had their lunch specials and dinner menus, and the food's quality has been on a constant slide downhill.

Not only are their no longer as spicy as they used to be, they're bland (un-salted) too. That along with excessive amounts of MSG is killing it!!"}
{"text":"I ordered food at 12:30 And did not receive the first plate until 1:20. The food is very good but if you're in a rush look at going somewhere else"}
{"text":"We usually go to the one in Scarborough but this one will do in a pinch.  The space is clean and open, we were seated immediately, the service was good and attentive.  Our order consisted of \"chili chicken - gravy\" and \"ma po tofu\" (sauce is chicken), both come with rice.  In addition, my husband opted for the second chili chicken for only $5, to take home.  The chili chicken was alright, if a little salty.  The spice level was good.  It doesn't come close to chili chicken of Royal Chinese Seafood Restaurant (Scarborough), Lin Garden (Scarborough) or Tangerine (in its heyday, Markham).  However, the ma po tofu was made with fried tofu.  In no universe does my ma po tofu come with fried cubes of tofu.  When the cubes are this small and fried, they become hollow cubes of skin which I do not enjoy.  The main reason that I love ma po tofu is for the silky cubes of 'fu.  If not for this, I would have given it the additional star.  I see that they deliver and have online ordering which is a nice service."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Generous portion.  The chilli shrimp (dry style) comes with huge shrimp and lots of it.  A steal for only $12.  Must try.  Amazing.  Food taste very good.  The spicy dishes are satisfying."}
{"text":"Recommend chilli chicken and fish dry. Don't get it with gravy. Fried rice is a bit oily but is worth getting then plain white rice

Service is excellent. 
Get your groupon deal if still around"}
{"text":"It takes courage and strategy for a small, independent Hakka restaurant to locate just a few steps next to Federick's.

A Yelper invited my BF and I to have lunch at Hakka King last Saturday.  The Hakka food here is different from Federick's.  In all, I find the food spicier than Federick's.  I liked the Chicken Pakora the best.  The exterior was slightly hard to the bite without a thick crunchy coat.  The Fish in Szechuan Sauce didn't taste like fish, because the spicy sauce was overwhelmingly spicy.  The stir fried noodle tasted average.  The Vegetable Balls was the strangest.  I could not tell the balls were made of vegetables.  I think that the food strategy of Hakka King is to make its Indian Chinese food more Indian than Chinese.  You will like it here if you like spicy Indian food. Also, portion is generous.

The dining room was quiet during our visit.  There were our table and another table only.  In other words, services was good, and food came out fast.  I noticed that there were quite a few take out orders, though."}
{"text":"Delicious hakka chinese food.

We had Chili chicken, fish pakoras, singapore rice noodles.  The fish pakoras were light and crispy, singapore rice noodles were delicious, chili chicken was nice also although I thought the batter coating on the chicken was a bit hard.  The spice was perfect.

Overall we enjoyed the food even more than Fredericks.  Staff was friendly and since we went for early lunch it wasn't busy.  Will come again!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Food is always very tasty. Don't come here for ambiance, just for solid hakka food."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out on Sunday evening. The Bombay Chicken is very good - will definitely come back for this dish again, 5 out of 5. The Manchurian Veggie Fried Rice is good. Portion is generous."}
{"text":"Ordered take out at 6:25pm, still waiting and it's 7:40pm. We were told 30 minutes on the phone when we ordered. Not the greatest experience to sit here and wait after a long day at work. First time here so can't comment on the food yet - since I've only seen it pass by for the past 45 min."}
{"text":"i should have read the reviews here before coming to this place, there is ONE waitress and im not kidding you it took her 1 hour to take our order, i had a groupon so i had no choice but to rough it out.  She did not know what she was doing, we waved at her for her attention and she acknowledged us several times but after 1 hour of her meddling randomness she took our order, after another hour we just left, only thing i ate was the money i lost from groupon."}
{"text":"I ordered Vegetable Hakka balls and vegetable chow mein, the quality was at par with Fredericks (my usual Hakka spot) which is located a few doors down. If you want to avoid a long wait at Fredericks for a seat on a Saturday night then just walk over here. 

3 stars because I wanted a glass of white wine - they had bottles on display and bottles in the fridge. He kept telling me he can't serve me wine for 2 hilarious reasons: the first being he didn't know \"how to prepare white wine\" and the second \"the bottle isn't opened yet!\". Seriously?!"}
{"text":"Plan in advance if taking out as they \"are too busy today to be able to make anything in 1 hour \" ..."}
{"text":"For at least a year now, I have seen various Groupon deals for this restaurant. This place is near Costco. Whenever I visit Costco, I end up eating at the food court. 

I decided a few Saturdays ago to drop by Hakka King and check out the food. It was roughly around 3 pm.

It is a family-run restaurant. Two women were sitting at a table. One of them was eating. The other got up and asked me whether I was ordering takeout. I indicated that I was hungry and wanted to dine in. She asked me to pick any table.

Once I did, I was promptly given a menu and a glass of water. Nice service!

I ordered the garlic chicken. It came with a bowl of rice.

I loved how much chopped garlic you get in this dish. It wasn't spicy. It would have been more enjoyable if it had some heat. However, I enjoyed how tender the chicken was. The sauce worked nicely. My indication is how much rice is left. I left nothing.

I got a fortune cookie with my bill. It was strange that, after cracking it open, not only did I get a fortune with a set of lottery numbers, but it gave me a link for a second fortune. Huh?

Anyway, I will return to try some more dishes. This area does get busy, as there are many businesses surrounding this restaurant.

{"text":"We had hakka chow mein, chicken in hot garlic sauce and crispy beef.

It wasnt tasty. Crispy ginger beef had a floury taste to it.

Service was good tho and they honoured our groupon without any hesitation 

Sorry. I wouldnt recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We found a voucher on groupon for this place. We paid $10 for $20 worth of food (I believe the groupon is still available!). 

We heard good stuff about this place and thought we'd give it a try as we're huge fans of Hakka food. I got the chilli mutton with gravy and my girlfriend got Manchurian chicken. Both dishes were extremely saucy. I really liked the chilli mutton as it was so flavourful and tasted delicious with the rice (the gravy made it more tasty too). They have a deal where if you get one chilli chicken you get the second for $5! The Manchurian chicken was only decent. Every Hakka place we go to we always get Manchurian chicken so we had something to compare it to. This place's Manchurian chicken was too bland even though it was drenched in sauce. Both dishes were around $8-$9 and the portion was quite big. 

Service was excellent as the server was really attentive and always checked up to see if we were doing good (drinks were always refilled!)."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Fredericks. This place really caught me off guard. After reading bad reviews of service, it was really good. The place filled up after  7 so we got here just in time.

The General Tao Fish wasn't red sweet and sour but more authentic with red chili's.  Flavor was on point. I could have eaten that by itself.

The chicken 88 has  Malay flavor.  Not too spicy so we emptied the chili jar on our table but the flavor was nice.

The Manchurian tofu and veg was just deep fried tofu with broccoli,  baby corn, boc chui , carrots,  onions in a soy base but style tasted bland. The other dishes made it up.

I am eager to explore this place some more. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Restaurant was nicely lit and clean.  The staff was also very nice and helpful.  The food was pretty tasty and dishes ranged from about $8.00 - $12.00 for a generous portion.  However, after 45 minutes upon leaving the restaurant, my stomach was a little queasy.  Not sure if it was the food or something else.  Overall would give this place a 3.5/5"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for Hakka King

the portions are big which is good.. food also tastes good.  although my chilli chicken was a little bit on the salty side.  

if you cant handle heat, this may not be the place for you.  Service was good and attentive.  If you do a survey at the end of your meal, they will email you a coupon."}
{"text":"I was greeted as soon as I walked in. Place looks new and very very clean. 

They have a big menu with tons of different dishes. All which sounded delicious. 

We ordered the chilli chicken, vegetable fried rice and a couple of spring rolls. (We were craving Chinese food and Fredericks was full, so we came here) 

Food quality was good. Nothing amazing but good and fresh. Will definitely return. 

Price wise was also quite cheap!! They also do deliver for FREE! 


Pros of my experience were: enormous serving of fried rice, delicious spring rolls. 

Cons of my experience were: we ordered dry chilli chicken, it came loaded with sauce. Also, waiter never checked up on us."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I ever had.

I eat Chinese food 5 - 8 times a month.
Went to this place with family. Ordered 2 appetizers and 5 entrees. Every single item we ordered was either burst or under cooked. Sent three dishes back to the kitchen to cook the shrimp more because they were raw. 

The food had NO taste whatsoever.

I complained to our waitress and commented to her that this was the worst Chinese food I ever had. Her response was \"our Chef quit and the person cooking in the kitchen is not very good at cooking Chinese food\"

I commented to the waitress why are you guys serving this kind of food to your customers and charging for it when you know it is no good? In her response she just shrugged her shoulders."}
