{"text":"Chili was nothing but a of cheese 
Taste was bland not even good 
Service was  sub sar"}
{"text":"Awful food (breakfast). Cold Potatoe wedges soggy with grease and sausage that was fried fat with no real meat.  Where do they this stuff? Service is good but unfortunately that doesn't fill your stomach."}
{"text":"Service was slow and don't bother with the Cobb salad.  Lunch meat, lettuce that was cut far too big,egg and bacon portion was limited and no trace of cheese.  Hostesses too busy chatting to seat anyone on a timely basis"}
{"text":"I ate the pulled pork sandwich and GOT FOOD POISONING!!!!!!

It was the only thing I ate that afternoon before flying home. When I got off the plane I was deathly ill and vomited violently the rest of the night.

I will add that when I asked the waiter about the sandwich, he winced and recommended the burger instead saying \"it's  made from fresher meat\". I should have taken the hint, but the pork looked good and I has not in the mood for a burger ."}
{"text":"The service was fast, but the food was lacking a lot.

It was very busy, but my food did come out quickly. I had the wings and the famous BBQ sauce tasted like tomato sauce with salt, pepper, and a hint of sugar or honey. 

Timothy probably would not make it as a server in a standard restaurant as I had to ask him for my drinks twice and never did bring me napkins.

Cindy, on the other hand, assisted without me even asking and was friendly to all servers and patrons alike.

The guy who seats you barely speaks English and doesn't care to ask you where you want to sit.

I will rethink coming here in the future. I would have given it one star but I did get my food quickly."}
{"text":"Great food. I was walking through terminal E wanting to grab a bite in bewteen flights. I saw this place and stopped right in. I was seated immediately, which was good because it got really busy shortly after I arrived. The waitress had a beer to my table in less than 3 minutes and my food shortly thereafter. Fantastic service and flavor!!!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 830 with a 2hr layover and decided to get brunch or regular breakfast since it was a Sunday. Well FAT chance of getting a mimosa or any alcoholic beverage.  They serve alcohol after 12 noon. Our waiter was rude about it after I said that's all I really wanted for breakfast.  We went ahead and ordered breakfast. I got the classic breakfast with 2 eggs your way. I asked to have them poached, the waitress laughed  .....and said either fried or scrambled.  Why advertise your way if it's only prepared two ways.

My husband got the large breakfast which was just like mine except they put 4 tbs of grits under his eggs, oh did I mention they only serve cold white un_toasted toast"}
{"text":"The cocktails are terrible and cost a fortune even though they don't put the prices on the menu. The food is mediocre at best. I had the Buffalo shrimp. It was a sad meal."}
{"text":"Avoid breakfast at this place...  poorly run during breakfast time, the staff doesn't care, and they truly fail to wait on your table.  The food wasn't good either.  Just sad...."}
{"text":"Passing through Charlotte airport and meal at Whisky River caused salmonella food poisoning.  After many test, visits to medical facility, and prescriptions it was not only confirmed but finally cured.  Most likely cause would be poor food handling and cleaning."}
{"text":"The fake cardboard whiskey barrels on the wall should have tipped me off to the crappiness of this place.  This is a super greasy spoon masquerading as a mid-tier bar and grill.  The on-tap selection is pretty small and the food quality is less than spectacular.  The club sandwich had meat that looked like it came straight from the deli at Wal-Mart.  The fried shrimp was no better."}
{"text":"I know airport restaurants aren't the same as city eateries but be aware Whisky River is not sensitive to flights, short stays and deadlines. Nor are they by any means good. I had an hour and got seated right away but that was the last of the quick service an airport restaurant should have. It took 20 minutes to get a beer 45 for a horribly under cooked Patty Melt, asked for medium and God a burger that had blood soaked bread. If I were squeamish that would be the end. But I asked for the check as soon as the food came and it took 15 more to get them to cash me out. 
If you're in a rush don't stop here it's not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Can't complain, despite the other low reviews, my service at the bar was outstanding. Cobb salad was good as well."}
{"text":"I would probably like to either eat here or have a beer, but I'll never know. The bar was full and the bartender ignored me when I stood at the bar. Then I went and waited in line at the host/horses station and the guy asked where I wanted to sit. I told him that all I wanted was a beer and wanted to get one then. He said he'd seat me by the bull and a server would help me so I told him I didn't have time to wait on a server but wanted to get a beer and pay for it then. He mumbled something unintelligible and took the guy behind me. So they can pound sand I won't be going there ever again."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Go somewhere else it's not worth it. 

BARTENDER was super rude. As was the  doorman. Bartender was Milady, she told me I could not hold a seat for my friend who was coming from a different gate and plane. I had already ordered our food. I was only drinking water and happened to be the only female at the bar so it felt as if she was a stripper working a bar for tips and not for Customer satisfaction.

So if you want somewhere to eat good food listen to good music and relax between your flights go somewhere else. You will feel more warmth sitting next to the TSA AGENTS.

Food was good music was good, seriously don't sit at the bar. If it's the only place open and youve had all the customer service you can handle I suggest you sit at a table. 

If you've had all the good service and pleasant personalities you can take in your travels and want to feel abused, unwanted and like your in a mean gurl scene sit at the bar."}
{"text":"'There are kids starving in Africa...'. But they wouldn't eat this stuff!  Ordered the boneless wings and they were so stale and dried out that they were more like left over bones.  I sent them back and you would've thought I tried to rob the place, as the waiter argued that they were fine - even if you couldn't stick a fork into them.  

To replace that pile of dog food, I ordered chili cheese fries (I know, I'm a real health nut!) and they came out with a strange soupy mix that made the fries soggier than soft boiled eggs...  maybe a fork of meat, a dozen red beans and some shredded cheese sprinkled very lightly on top of the potato soup.  Yuck!

All around it was a very bad experience and I only gave them one star because there aren't lower ratings."}
{"text":"Yuck, buffalo chicken ranch wrap was bland and cole slaw side was a lazy dump of mayo. As far as airport food standards go, this is below the bar - by a lot."}
{"text":"Our waitress, Chanel clearly wasn't listening as we placed the order. As soon as she walked away from our table, I told my friend our food would not be right. BINGO - she brought fries when my friend said \"no fries\". Her burger was dry and inedible. I ordered a black and blue burger with a veggie patty substitute and I got a mushroom and Swiss burger. Wait?? WHAT??? There was some slight empathy from the waitress but it didn't feel very genuine. I'm sitting here now waiting for her to offer to bring my bill. Tick tick!!! I think she accidentally asked once if we needed anything else but she hasn't been back since. 
Update - Chanel is getting ready to clock out soon so she's going around asking people to settle their bills now before she goes. Good thing it's all about her. Good riddance!
Awful food, slow waitress and apathetic customer service. Run run far away from Whisky River in CLT!!!"}
{"text":"I struggled writing this review. While, the food was delicious (my husband and I got the tequila burger) the service was abismal. 

It took forever to get our drinks and all we asked for was water. Once our order was placed we again waited for an extraordinary length of time. While we finished our food not once did our waitress come back and check on us or offer to refill our drinks. One of the waitresses was more interested in taking snaps by the bar then serving her customers in the not overly crowded restaurant. 

If you're looking for a place to kill a long layover this place will definitely fulfill your needs as you will be here for over 2 hours. If however you're looking to make a tight connection your better off hitting up another joint."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. I waited 22 mins just to order my drink. When I stopped two waiters, they stated that that isn't their section. One gentleman saw the frustration on my face, and decided to help me. The food was ok. I ordered the salmon and potatoes. I probably will never return again."}
{"text":"Service was good. Ordered the beef brisket. It was tough instead of being tender.  Also ordered the Moscow mule.  It was a lil off."}
{"text":"I didn't read any of the other reviews before deciding to try this place for the first time. I have been coming through Charlotte for years and was sad to see the old restaurant replaced by Whiskey River.  I knew several of the wait staff and they were my breakfast place because of the prompt service.

Tonight I had some time because of a long layover, so I gave the place a try. Service was just fine. The menu is not that broad, but just fine for airport food. This is the place to get a solid meal and be able to watch the game. There are enough TV's for everyone. I don't drink, so someone else will have to tell you about the beer selection. The salmon was good."}
{"text":"Over priced average food. Service was fine and timely. Pulled pork was OK but small for the price. One in our party really like the French fries."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. Multiple TVs with college football on, just about every game. For airport food it was pretty good. Waited on by really nice bartender. He was hard working and very friendly."}
{"text":"Unbelievably horrible service. I sat and waited forever to order a beer, then they brought the wrong one. Waited forever for the correct one. Then forever to get a visit to order. By that time. I had to leave. Unreal.."}
{"text":"Little pricey for beer but service is quick. Very important in an airport. Service was also friendly which I can't always say.  Kitchen is quick and efficient as well."}
{"text":"Well I was hoping for something a little better but when you arrive here expect it to be dirty. Me sing the tables and chairs have precious diners left over crumbs. However the service is slow so maybe they leave those to tease you or for those impatient and so hangry, an lil snack before your actually take the plunge and order. Okay the atmosphere is country with blues. Cool seats with faux cow hide backs. I hope they are fake! There is a small stage for entertainment. I guess if you flight is delayed this could be great. We just missed the
Live music because guys was taking his black bag and leaving. The music they pipe thru heir system
Is loud if you don't want to talk to someone, come here
Check out the belt buckle walk. That's a nice distraction why waiting for your food which takes a while. Hopefully you won't be seated in the back by the whiskey barrel wallpaper because all you have to distract yourself with is people or free internet like me. Okay the menu is general American fare. We tried the chicken burger with bleu cheese crumbles. Ugh! The flavor on the chicken breast was too salty and not what I anticipated. the fries were okay. Overall, is it better than other airport food? No. I advise you to walk to different terminal and try something else. Not worth it"}
{"text":"What a great start to the trip! I work in the restaurant industry and have never seen this level of service in an airport bar. Great service for any type of restaurant. Brad was an amazing bartender, the drinks & food were delicious! We will be back next time we pass through!"}
{"text":"My 2 hour layover was made awesome by the live music and service of Mikayla! I'm blown away by the quality of food, service and atmosphere! This will be my go to spot everytime I'm at the Charlotte airport for sure!"}
{"text":"They might make more tips if they came out of the kitchen and actually waited on people . Not happy"}
{"text":"Sandwich was tasty but cold and while the fries were on the minute as \"bbq\" they  were plain fries and cold. I don't ever hold out high hopes for airport food but this was the worse and the service was horrible and not even at the height of normal rush hours"}
{"text":"Came here while waiting to catch a flight . I was seated right away but it took awhile for someone to come take my order and when someone finally and over it wasn't even the waitress in my section. I ordered the Texas club and it was below average. The ham and turkey were a weird texture as it was just very bland. No one checked on me me until they brought my check.  Not impressed, wouldn't recommend eating here ."}
{"text":"Why 1 star? Because of some of the most rude customer service I've ever received.

  ---   ---   ---

I did not plan on writing this review today, but after some of the most egregious customer service I've ever received, I could not resist. For those who regularly see my reviews, you'll notice two common comments:

1) I try not to kill a business with a review due to one part-time employee having a bad day.

2) I've written nearly 1,100 reviews, and only 9 are 1-star, at the time of this visit. I try to be positive, even when a place doesn't offer a ton of positivity. 

With that being said, let me paint the scene:

-My flight from Tampa-Charlotte was delayed, so I had to sprint from Terminal E - Terminal B while wearing Tom's and carrying 2 bags.

-I arrived at my gate, feeling like I just ran a marathon, only to learn that I missed the opportunity to board by 2 minutes. Awesome.

-I made arrangements to board the next flight and felt the need to find a good beer.

-How convenient? Right next to my gate was a restaurant/bar, called Whiskey River! 

-I take two steps in to said establishment, look for the beer taps at the bar, and realize that there aren't any within sight. 

-I turn around and ask the one of hostesses if she has a beer list I can see. She hands me a menu.

***THE FUN PART***

-The other hostess (named Kaylan) then addresses the other hostess and loudly asks, \"Hey _____, can you tell me what the sign right outside the restaurant says?\"

Other hostess: \"See hostess to be seated.\"

Kaylan: \"Ohhhh that's what I thought! And can you tell me what the sign back there, just beyond that sign says?\"

Other hostess: \"See hostess to be seated.\"

Kaylan: \"Yes, that's what I thought too!\"

I drop menu back on hostess stand, and walk away.

Apparently Kaylan found it wildly inappropriate that I took two steps inside the threshold of the business to look at the taps, without addressing her first. She then dealt with the situation in the most rude way possible. I can't recall dealing with someone that rude at a restaurant in all of the time I've been writing Yelp reviews. If I were the owner, there is a zero percent chance that she would be employed another day.

I have never written a review of a business without actually purchasing something, and I have never written a review within 30 minutes of an experiencing a place. This situation was so outrageous that I felt like I had no choice."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. Unfortunately the food is prepared to leave the kitchen fast. I had the Buffalo Chicken Wedge which consisted of two chicken fingers, the kind you would find frozen at Costco and blue cheese obviously out of a 1 gallon jug."}
{"text":"I was traveling by myself from the west coast back to the east coast and decided to try this place since I had a long layover.  I was seated at a table of other party of ones. 
The service was nice and easy going. I ordered Goin' Down South and the salmon and it was all delicious. 
The live music was easy going, the restaurant was packed, and it was an overall enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant, this place is great. Service is good and personable. I am usually there 
late afternoons, a busy time. Have my pale ale and and a burger. And am ready for my connecting flight."}
{"text":"Nice bar but needs bigger tvs in bar area.  Good service.  Plugs right at the bar is a super idea."}
{"text":"2 stars for service. 0 for food and drink.  Chardonnay - tasted like spoiled juice. Grilled chicken caesar salad was chicken from a can, not even close to grilled! Cost me $14. Disgrace."}
{"text":"Service and food is great no need to right a long review. Only negative is that it's very expensive which is what you expect at the airport. Yes I would recommend. Want a cheap but good dish while waiting for your flight get a quesadilla... delicious!"}
{"text":"If you are changing planes in the vicinity of Terminal D or E, this is your best bet.  Decent music choices on the audio system.  The wall of belt buckles is worth checking out.  As with all airport food, overpriced.  But what are you going to do?"}
{"text":"Bad airport food. Who runs out of pancakes in the early morning? Flimsy dry over cooked omelet and gotta say it was the worst omelet I ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Good service makes a WORLD of difference. 

If you find yourself trapped in Charlotte at the airport with hours to kill waiting for a flight, come to Whiskey River. The booze is very good. I'm a Manhattan drinker, and their take on the classic is worth the $9 price tag. Ask for a Woodford Manhattan and enjoy yourself ($16). #worthit

The food is average. Quesadillas are good, but not worth $13, even with chicken and guac added.

But the service from Matt is AMAZING. He is attentive and quick, which is not an easy task in this extremely busy spot. Still, you feel like your tab is the only cover he's serving. SO GOOD.

Try to sit at the bar facing the rotunda outward from the actual restaurant, as far from the live music as possible. It's just annoying if you're too close. The musicians are fine, but super loud. Besides, the bar has power outlets underneath that you can exploit. #protip"}
{"text":"I didn't make it past the hostess stand at this joke of a restaurant. On a layover I decided on a sit-down meal. The hostess asked my name and I gave it to her despite at least 8 open tables I could see. Another gentleman checked in behind me and we proceeded to stand there for 10 minutes as other guests left and vacated more tables. Finally the hostess asked, do you want a table? I said, I thought that's why I was standing here. She said, do you two mind sharing a table? I said, why, you have at least 10 tables open. She said but those are 4 tops. Now I frequent airports every week and have never been not given an empty table. Ridiculous!!!!"}
{"text":"Food mediocre and service terrible. No silver ware, beverage refill offers, or notice that I didn't eat most of my food... and still When I paid my check I was asked \" do you need change\" -- the equivalent of \"are you leaving a tip for me?\""}
{"text":"This place is seriously bad. The food, service, live music and price is a joke. Dale Jr. You should get your people in this. When the best thing I can say is the tater tots aren't too bad, well you get my drift."}
{"text":"Just 2 stars for the food...which is the most important thing about a restaurant, right? Lively atmosphere...great place to grab a drink or catch the game between flights. The waiter seated the 3 of us at a table for 6. Then later seated a lady with us who was dining alone. Made for an awkward dining experience for us all!"}
{"text":"I was there on a Friday and they had a live band. I didn't ask, but since they have a small stage, I'm guessing it is a regular occurrence! I had the Texas Tequila Bacon Cheddar Burger. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Located on concourse E this chain restaurant is a great option for an interesting breakfast. The entrees are unique and reasonably priced. I ordered the rebel biscuit which had some hits and misses. The big hits were a friendly staff, good music and atmosphere, flavorful sauce, well cooked chicken, and interesting plate composition. The big miss was a really dry biscuit. The dryness of the biscuit made consuming the dish tiresome and marred an otherwise great experience."}
{"text":"WARNING! NO ALCOHOL SERVED BEFORE 12 ON SUNDAYS. That is overall, so if you're in the airport on a Sunday and want a refreshing beverage, think again. 

The service was fast, efficient, and friendly. We had the dirty tots. Worth every calorie! We also had the Buffalo chicken wrap. It could have been wrapped better, but it was spicy, definitely had bleu cheese on it, but also came with cucumbers. I didn't care for that either. We were there at 11 on a Sunday, were in, ate, and out within 40 minutes. If alcohol would have been served, we would have stayed much longer.  I'd say overall enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Edwin was a great server despite the poor hostess team. Food good despite few garnishments."}
{"text":"What a treat! Live music at an airport bar on a Tuesday afternoon. Great service and lots of places to charge your phone if necessary  (perfect for layovers)."}
{"text":"Had the inevitable three hour layover and so what do you do, go find a bar and get some comfort food.  Do you remember the good ok' days when bartenders were friendly? Yeah, me too, but evidently not in the CLT airport at Whiskey River. Both bartenders (make and female) never smiled, not once, at any patron.  The proverbial icing was The three chicken fingers for $12 that I were pancake flat and un-tasty.  My advice to fellow travelers, go to the Mexican cantina in the center of the airport... better food and smiling faces."}
{"text":"I'm offering 2 stars because the service was decent. But honestly, I want to give it one star. I should have looked at Yelp before we decided to grab lunch here. I've definitely had better frozen chicken tenders before. These were chewy and not crispy at all. The blue cheese salad dressing was not good and the ranch was not better. Pass on this place and go to the wine bar."}
{"text":"Got seated right away, dining alone while traveling for work. I don't have high expectations for airport restaurants, but expect it to be the typical experience. I waited 10 minutes for a waiter to approach me. He did and took my drink order. Showed back up to take my food order. I asked for a Cobb salad with ranch. Response was that they didn't have salads or sandwiches. Bewildered, I asked why. \"Our kitchen staff.\" Told me I could order quesadillas or burgers. Some entrees, mashed potatoes. One would have thought to mention that to me when he took my drink order! I order my second choice of a quesadilla. It shows up, with barely any filling, which consists of a few pieces of corn, scattered black beans, tons of onions, mushrooms and scant cheese. I stopped the waiter and asked where the chicken was, as it said grilled chicken quesadilla on menu. Response? \"You didn't ask for it. Don't think we have it anyway.\" Usually if something comes with a choice of filling the person taking the order will prompt the customer. I pointed out the random french fry I found in it. Waiter could care less. Laughed it off and walked away without offering to take it back and fix it. No manager on duty it seems. I will never come back here."}
{"text":"I stopped by Whiskey River while traveling today.  The place is packed, it seems everyone is looking for a place to sit and grab a bite this afternoon.  I ordered the boneless buffalo wings and I waited and I waited. 30 minutes later my wings arrived.  I took my first bite only to find them cold to the touch.  I wasn't really surprised as it had taken so long to get them.  I mentioned to the waitress they were cold and she asked if I wanted her to bring me some more. I declined telling her I didn't have much time.  Five minutes later she presented me with a fresh plate of hot boneless buffalo wings.  They were hot in temperature and hot in flavor.  Customer service really turned this visit around."}
{"text":"Appetizer and a cocktail $32.00. I guess to be expected with airport food... Only way I'd return is if I was stuck in Terminal E again"}
{"text":"I'm not usually one to rave about airport food, but I had a great experience at Whiskey River in the Charlotte Airport. I had a 3 hour layover and wanted a sit-down meal instead of grabbing fast food. Whiskey River caught my eye because the place was pretty full and they had live music inside. They also have a large bar space and a huge wall covered in belt buckles- I was sold. 

I was seated immediately and the waiter was prompt and attentive. I had a glass of wine, which was actually pretty decent. But my sandwich was the real star of the show! I loved the brisket grilled cheese. Although it could've been a little cheesier, it was packed full of delicious brisket. There are many sides to choose from, and their fries were pretty good. This is a neat little place to grab a drink or some food if you have time to kill in the airport."}
{"text":"The burger was good but if you order the banana pudding be ready to be disappointed. I think the bananas must have been in witness protection cause they surely were not in the serving I was given!"}
{"text":"Seating is quite crowded. Menu is expensive. I ordered the nachos with grilled chicken. The grilled chicken was obviously just some chicken pulled from the freezer and heated. The cheese and pico and other toppings made these nachos sweet tasting. Which was fine but I wasn't really expecting that. In the middle of my meal a woman came on to sing, which was fun and good. Probably wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"In the Raleigh airport, traveling for work - a group of 7 restaurant managers from a national chain. Asked to be seated, it was busy so we were willing to wait. Hostess was a bit rude to us, but we were hungry. Manager came out and told us we couldn't all sit together. We told him we were fine waiting, then no one ever came and checked with us again. We ate somewhere else then came back to get drinks. There were only 6 seats at the bar so we grabbed a chair from a nearby EMPTY table. The bartender told us that was absolutely not allowed. We asked for the manager(same toothless guy as before) who basically told us they were only allowed to have a certain number of seats at the bar. I just don't understand what kind of customer service this is?? I will tell everyone i come in contact with to NEVER spend money at Whiskey River!!!"}
{"text":"On today, Feb 22, 2018, I had thee WORST experience from a manager named Kelly at the Airport Whiskey River restaurant in Charlotte, NC....I had PLASTIC/PAPER in my food that I consumed and when I brought it to Kelly's attention she treated it and me as if I said I had onions on a burger that I didn't ask for....I made them take the whole plate back however she offered other options to which I thought was out of courtesy for PLASTIC/PAPER being in my food...which wasn't the case, cause she brought me a bill and when I politely questioned her about it, she went on to tell me that I shouldn't assume and that I shouldn't be trying to get \"free food\"......!!!!!!!!!! There was NO apology that YOUR cooks managed to have objects in my food, she came at me AND the group I was with as if we were in the wrong for wanting AT LEAST good customer service skills....and I'm NEVER \"that customer\" who is rude or impolite....but TODAY she made me angry enough to where I had to leave her AND that tab because her and I and even some of the people I was with was about to go toe2toe with her!! THATS how rude she was!!! I have NO problem paying for anything, but what I WONT put up with is managers who have 0.0000 customer service skills.....wont ever go there again as long as she's the manager!!!"}
{"text":"Worst place, I should have stayed in the main hub to eat but wanted to get near gate.  Bad judgement.  Wouldn't even stop here but there is no place in E terminal with any room/sears.  I won't torture you with the photo of the food.  Terrible service too as usual.  Sorry, not my normal post."}
{"text":"It's airport food, I get it. But once you've tagged me $10 for a beer, it would be nice - and I don't believe too much to ask - that the chicken be at least slightly more meat than breading. Furthermore, it was done frying about 2 hours ago guys, it's dead, I promise. Finally, cardboard bread is pretty much expected but can we reduce the volume by about 90% so that the sandwich contents can actually be located by my taste buds? Sigh."}
{"text":"Airport eating at it's worst.  I ordered a chicken salad that was basically all white lettuce.  Didn't even include what was specified on menu.  Fries were over cooked and tasteless.  We had waters, a pulled pork sandwich, wings, and a salad for $47.  If you are vegetarian or care at all about the healthiness (or quality for that matter) of your food, go somewhere else.  Just go here for nachos and drinks.  On a plus side, our server was very nice and the other staff we talked to were all very kind as well."}
{"text":"I had layover, saw the cool looking atmosphere, came in. My waiter didn't speak too well, I asked him what sauce he recommends with the wings, no answer. I asked him if the wings come with sides, he says no. I order the wings and a stella. He grabs the menu without saying anything before I can tell him what sides I want as extras and leaves. The wings were on par with what you would get in a grocery store pre-packaged shite section. Little meat, blah. I got the check after and was real happy for my 9.99 Stella. Twilight Zone."}
{"text":"It's my favorite place to hang out on layovers in CLT. The place is always packed but it's not hard to grab a seat at the bar since people are frequently coming and going. The beer selection is great lots of local NC beers! The food is meh. Everything is priced as you would imagine being at the airport but it's not very good. My nachos were drenched so bad in cheese that you could even pick up a chip.. Kinda like a nacho soup. It was gross and I ended up with a salad that was fine."}
{"text":"Not a good place for breakfast.  Food was weak and COVERED in pepper.  Service was attentive but not friendly.  Get em in get em out mentality which works for an airport.  Food arrived quickly at least."}
{"text":"I travel quite a bit, and between the service and quality of food, this ranked up there as far as 'bad' experiences.  I ordered a blue cheese salad with boneless wings.  The 'wings' barely contained chicken and instead were 95% batter.  My server also had zero concept of time, or how to refill drinks.  In short, if you are looking for a 'quick' bite at the CLT airport, I would recommend another place.  The food here was not good at all, and the service not much better."}
{"text":"My favorite spot to come to in the Epicenter. Love the diversity. Great space and great party."}
{"text":"Ok first off this is an Airport Restaurant. And I'm rating it accordingly. Lots of sports TVs. Music Loud enough that u have. To raise your voice. Service is friendly and fast. The menu is pricey for what they are offering but my pulled pork sandwich ($12.99) plus side salad ($2.99) was good. Definitely Western Carolina BBQ served with cole slaw and pickles on Texas toast. The $8.99 Chardonnay would have been a good deal at $7 buy the portion was generous. I'd eat here again if I got trapped on a layover on concourse E."}
{"text":"Airport. Wings 1 lb? Need to look up how many wingetts should be in pound. Asked for dry but got with sauce on. Too messy to take on plane will stress this next time if I return-not likely. Even with sauce too dry. Had side of broccoli perfect."}
{"text":"Terrible service, served me still frozen wings, and took almost 20 minutes to bring my check after ignoring me multiple times. I'm not one to complain, but this was easily the worst dining experience I have ever had."}
{"text":"Bad service, barely passable food. Stopped in for breakfast while traveling. Waitress was asking for our drink order literally before we had a chance to sit down. Told her to come back. She took too long. Had to suffer through terrible blaring country music. Buffalo chicken omelette was ok. Tasted like buffalo sauce and blue cheese. Hard to screw up. Wife's biscuits and gravy were gross.  Biscuits were weirdly sweet and soggy even in places that hadn't touched gravy (undercooked?).  After struggling to get service through our meal, when the check came the waitress now had nothing better to do than chat at us for about 10 min. We were obviously tired and uninterested in conversation. Fortunately (or unfortunately) we weren't rushing to a flight."}
{"text":"Staff is not friendly or speedy.  Restaurant was at best 1/4 capacity and yet I waited 21 minutes for my waitress to take my drink order.  When she finally did, I realized she had walked right by me 5 times and been conversing with another waitress 5 feet from me."}
{"text":"This rating is being generous. The menu looked okay for breakfast nothing special. I ordered the classic breakfast-eggs over medium, bacon and a biscuit instead of toast.

One egg was completely hard, one was medium. The weird thing is they were connected so you would think they both would have been cooked the same. The bacon was something you get out of those pre-cooked boxes. Not tasty at all. The biscuit was served dry with packaged jelly on the side. When I asked for butter I was given some very soft spread-no way it was butter.

I have eaten here before as it is close to my gate but this is the last time for me. Much better options in the main terminal."}
{"text":"Typical airport restaurant with typical airport quality food: overpriced and not very good. 

The things on the menu here sound like they'd be pretty good if you were dining at one of the Whisky Rivers outside the airport  but here, it's just bland. 

The reason I came here is because I wanted to watch the NASCAR race while waiting on my plane and since it's owned by Dale Earnhardt Jr., I thought it would be good. 

Ordered a burger and it was nothing to write home about. Not bad but definitely not good. No spices, no pizazz, no nothing. 

Last, but not least, the pricing. Ain't it amazing that one of his other restaurants in downtown Charlotte, this meal is around $10.99 but at the airport, it's $15.99. 

Not complaining too much about airport prices because I'm used to it. Trap a passenger inside when they're hungry and they'll pay any price. 

But they could do a little more to improve the taste and service."}
{"text":"This airport restaurant was a great brunch stop while waiting to board our plane! The cocktails were a bit pricey but delicious. The bartenders were very nice and attentive. Food was delicious and reasonably priced. The restaurant has a nice appearance. Good selection of whiskey and bourbon."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but don't stop in here to eat unless you have a 3 hour layover. The service sucks and after waiting 15 minutes for the waitress to take out order 30 minutes later the food came out and mine wasn't even close to what I ordered. Then the waitress acted like it was an imposition to get the correct order. I will not stop in here again. This was my second try here and both times were bad. As someone who goes through CLT every week I don't recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Salty salty salty! Holy cow!! This was just okay. Had the Low Country Pouttine.  Sirloin, fries \"cheese curds\" gravy and an over easy egg. They obviously do not know what cheese curds are. This was like melted mozzarella. I asked for the steak to be rare and it was as tough as well done. Aweful meal. But, we're talking airport food here so I guess we should set the bar low. Really low. Definitely wouldn't order again. $19.99. I should've stuck with a cheeseburger I guess. Next time. Also, glass of wine = $12.75 for a normal size (9oz) and this is the cheapest on the menu. They offer a 6oz for less but, really? I've never even heard of a \"six ounce pour\". WTH??"}
{"text":"Tolerable.

This is a Southern restaurant minus the charm.  The decor is very nice and the ideas seem fancy, but the food (in my case, a burger - there isn't much that you wouldn't find at any pub) and drink (Mountain Dew and whiskey do not a cocktail make) were somewhat underwhelming.  Given the rather hefty price of food here, I definitely can't recommend it.

The servers were incredibly nice, though, which I appreciated."}
{"text":"Hmmm. I know better. Slow down, read the reviews., don't just walk in because Jr's name is on the place. Didn't do it and I paid for it. 

Service was excellent. The good. 

The bad. Menu is interesting. Ordered the \"low country poutine.\"  One would think that an item with  \" low country\" in the title might have shrimp, crawfish something like this but no. It was steak-based with a whiskey inspired sauce over French fries. Lots of cheese that was either microwaved or oven-baked. Difficult to cut, so I asked for a knife. Was told they only had forks. What??? Is this prison?? 

Steak was tough and cut into such large pieces that I passed on the steak. 

Hence the 2 stars."}
{"text":"I am giving this place a four because the service was just fantastic. This place is busy, and with all the people who stop here while traveling, the servers stay personable and the service was fast! Which is great, because we are in an airport, trying to catch a flight...you know you can grab a cocktail and dinner and not miss you flight. Lol.
 
As far as the food.....eh. Not super flavorful. I had a pulled pork sandwich which should have amazing flavor...was kind of bland. But it came out hot and fast....and I'm in an airport...so, can't really complain. If your expectations at an airport restaurant is high, you need to re-evaluate your standards or don't ever eat at a restaurant in an airport. Lol. 

And hey, they got live music here too which is nice. So yeah, got a few hours while laying over for your next flight...I'd come here again to mellow out, enjoy a good drink, decent food, and a nice ambiance while I wait..."}
{"text":"Food is very average airport restaurant food. Prices are expectedly high, especially the beer. Gave it 3 stars for the very enjoyable live music. First time for that an airport bar/restaurant."}
{"text":"This site is a one-two-punch when it comes to service, entertainment and great food! Can't say enough about, esp since the server is the catalyst for an ideal dining experience. Such is true for me days ago.

KELLI is T H E  B E S T . . . for top-flight service from prompt, efficient and congenial service to large, plump chicken wings, seasoned beyond expectations. I can't say enough about Kelli - her smile, cordiality and ahead-of-the-ape-ball timing. Extra napkins on the table early on without me asking, timely refills on drink, clean/beautiful grooming and a one million dollar smile - all the ingredients that welcome and sustain a weary traveler. 

The tall, blonde, female singer was easy on the ears that became medicine to my soul after a long day w clients. The music, food and server was a cocktail for gratification, especially in a busy airport.

Thanks to all staff for such an uplifting experience. May your tribes increase!!!"}
{"text":"This was a convenient restaurant in the Charlotte airport. The options were typical with what you would expect: sandwiches, wraps, salads, fries, etc. 

It was a nice option to sit down and enjoy your food instead of getting a bunch of carry out items. 

The service was fast and there was enough room to have your baggage next to you, as all of us did in the restaurant. 

I would recommend if you have the time to sit down & enjoy your food."}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere was good. Food was average. Prices were okay for a sit down airport restaurant. We wouldn't hesitate to stop here for a meal of we had a layover and were hungry."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I thought the food here was pretty average (I had a pulled pork sandwich). The service, however, was very fast and efficient. I was able to get dinner pretty quickly. I definitely was out of there w/in 30 minutes. Prices are about average for an airport restaurant. 

Overall, a decent eating option in terminal E if you have more than an hour layover in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Do not go by the interiors. The ambience, the decor is marvelous. The food is OK. You could make what they serve at home and possibly make it better. We went there for breakfast. I decided to try their biscuit with fried chicken and eggs. Nothing special or even good for that matter. 
What's good about this place is their coffee. I like my coffee black and it was delicious. That's one star. 
They also let me sub my potatoes for fresh fruit which is the second star. 
The bill was 32 ish for two people- NOT WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"It's a Kardashian.  Looks pretty on the outside but nothing to brag about once you had it.  Food was lukewarm and bland.  Waiter had no personality.  I was happy they had a good selection of spirits.  And the food came out fast but that also explains why the food was likewarm."}
{"text":"Best food in Charlotte Airport! Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner! Great service at the bar!"}
{"text":"Avoid Tuesday mornings! This is my normal go to place when I land in charlotte every other week, usually on Friday. This week happened to be a Tuesday. Wow never again- cold food- waited 20 mins for her to show up- she put the check down and said I need you to sign this. Never asked me if I wanted anything else. Horrible service today!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm genuinely confused about their business model. This restaurant is at an airport. I was traveling alone, and I was asked if I'd sit at a shared table, and I readily agreed. I told the hostess that I needed to catch a flight, and I asked her about the fastest item on the menu. When the waitress came to get the drink order, I asked for \"Water, please, and the fastest item on the menu: the pulled pork sandwich.\" She smiled, nodded, collected the menu and a few minutes later brought the water. After 35 minutes, I realized that I'd have less than 5 minutes to wolf down a sandwich that arrived now. The man next to me received his food and I asked him how long between ordering and receiving food; 45 minutes, he said. I had to leave. Now here is the crazy thing... I eat at a lotta bbq joints, some are literally twice as busy as this place, and a pulled pork sandwich typically take FIVE minutes. This place here is at an airport, for goodness sake. Get your act together. Zero stars, but cannot post with less than one."}
{"text":"2 people next to me ordered burgers and it came out log before my quesadilla.   It was cold.  I asked to remove from Holland they came back in 5 and literally dumped another one at my seat.  It too was cold.  I ask them to remove it from bill again and bartender got pissy and annoyingly
Dropped bill..... rude and unprofessional.   If u want anything to drink in E Concourse, do it before you get to whiskey river!!!!"}
{"text":"I like the concept.  Just say at the bar but the food looked very good.  Bar staff was great.  Music and tvs.  Great amp and good energy."}
{"text":"I mean it's still rushed airport food. The cooks will always have  a non-stop stream of orders, restaurant will always be capacity. That being said, not a bad meal.  Good service. I fly through Charlotte alot so I'll be back."}
{"text":"Had a 3 hr layover so I decided to stop for a sit down meal.   I had a burger with fries and a glass of wine.  Surprisingly, it didn't set me back too much.  The food was very good and Daniel, my server was great.  This was my first visit here, but I fly through Charlotte frequently and this won't be my last."}
{"text":"Airport service is usually bad. This place is awful. Had a great beer though. But in an hour 15 min got one beer. I guess they saved me some money!"}
{"text":"It's an airport restaurant. I was told it was voted favorite airport restaurant but I've had better. The live music wasn't all that good. The patty melt was the smallest I'd ever seen and was served on a huge empty plate. Service was fine but I wouldn't waste my time there again."}
{"text":"Man. The service is slow. Slooooowwwww. Like 20 minutes to get a seat at a table with four strangers. Then 20 minutes to order a drink. Then 20 minutes to get said drink. The food is average at best and the prices are high. The best part of the experience was listening to the life story of 87 year old man at my table. If this wasn't the only sit down restaurant on the E gates of CLT, they'd be out of business."}
{"text":"If there was a half star or no star rating this place would get it. Waited at the hostess station for about 10 minutes while three waitresses stood and talked. Finally got a salad because you don't have to cook it and it should be fast. Contacted a different waiter because my waitress was kidnapped by space ninjas. She was 3 time hide and seek of the Eastern US. Manager never showed up... Went to the bar and asked again for a manager. Miraculously my salad shows up after at least 40 minutes. Never once got a refill. This place has good food. The service is a joke and that is being very nice. I work here along with many other international airports. You will never get a good recommendation until the service staff improves. .0000001 stars"}
{"text":"Specifically came here for the brisket quesadilla. Never have time due to tight connections, but today flight actually arrived early. Put in the order, closed out tab early to be ready to go after eating. Tab was $9 as the bartender forgot to put the order in...and the $9 relates to a bud light which was also delivered an an afterthought. Left a tip, but I shouldn't have."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible, I visited on a Sunday evening. It's not even busy. Took 10-15min to order and even get my drinks. For an airport and business travelers they should be much quicker than this.  I have been here 30min and haven't received my food. This is kind of ridiculous. The beer I ordered isn't even all that cold. Still waiting on food."}
{"text":"Had a layover in Charlotte airport, so we tried Whisky River for lunch.  We both had salads and I have to say the portions were big!  I couldn't finish my Chicken Caesar!  The only thing I didn't like is there were no croutons :(   And the dressing was definitely all at the bottom of the bowl.  Not a deal breaker though as it was still a tasty salad!

What I liked:  There was a device on the table where you could press buttons to summon your service, pay, or cancel the order.  The servers all had devices on their wrists (like a watch) so that they could attend to the tables.  Good to have when you need to get in and out quick!  I mean who wants to miss their flight over a lunch??  

All in all not a bad place to hang out for a few.  (Yes, there is a bar there too!)"}
{"text":"Don't you dare eat here and not try a local beer. Noda Jam session, jalapeño beer, so many options. If you order a bud, you're missing out. Food served is an excellent option in concourse E."}
{"text":"Very disappointing! Took 25 min to get a salad and grilled cheese. Salad had about a bottle of dressing on it, and the grilled cheese was soggy and cold. Asked for slaw, got Tater tots. Will never eat here again. I'm a big Junior fan but this sucked."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch while in transit.  I am not sure what I expected but it wasn't good at all.  I had the mushroom Swiss burger as it was the only thing wasn't smothered with something.  

I am not looking for exceptional gourmet but better than what I got.   The service was really good so that is why I gave the rating I did.  

I would not repeat."}
{"text":"During our lay over at Charlotte-Douglas airport we had time to eat. We were seated quickly and got our drinks. Once we placed our order (boneless chicken bites), it took awhile to get our order. The wait staff was attentive. We thought the breading on the chicken was to heavy, but the sauce was good. We would go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Horrible bartender chick! Took some dudes order who walked up when I'd been sitting there 5 minutes!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst wings I've ever tried to eat. I took a video of attempting to pierce them with a fork repeatedly without success. The manager was very nice and agreed they were not edible by a human. He had them cook more but they were only barely edible. The place had pretty decent food up until the last months of 2016. Not sure what happened but I seriously won't be back. No problems with the manager or waitress but serious kitchen issues."}
{"text":"The food was OK, nothing fancy, but not bad. The service was very slow, and I didn't even get my drink until well after my meal had come. I did not get much attention from the waitstaff."}
{"text":"The food was just ok. 
The biggest factor to know is that these waitresses are rude and unhappy to be at work!  I had to ask twice for a refill on Coke and she made me feel like a big inconvenience.  

Traveling airports are hard enough these days, so don't make this experience a pain too!
Especially for the prices they charge."}
{"text":"As every other restaurant (with the exception of the Market) in this airport, this one has awful service and awful food. Only come here if you are going to sit at the bar and has at LEAST 1 and a half hours. It will take your server around 30 minutes to come greet you and another 30 minutes for your food to come. The food is not good, way different than the original outside of the airport. I am not sure why these restaurants still risk their business by allowing HMS Host to operate their reputable businesses. I will not come back here and encourage others to do the same."}
{"text":"Fantastic quick breakfast service. Get the yogurt parfait, a big bowl at a great price. Waiter couldn't have been better, very attentive!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service,  excellent food, got the Dirty Tots, great quick bite to eat, BBQ sauce good with a little bite to it. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"The service was painfully slow in a half full restaurant area. The server was sweet, but not really attentive. I sat 20 minutes before anyone came to take my order and that was only after I asked another server to send mine over. Everything took too long for precooked (thin, dry) brisket, taters, etc. When it finally came it was cold. I informed the server, paid for my drink and went next door for an overpriced Luke warm slice of pizza before I had to get to my flight. I know that Dale wouldn't stand for this and either should his fans. This place is the Danica Patrick of restaurants, looks great, lots of hype, no performance."}
{"text":"Wow! What a happy find.  Been awake since 1:30 am flying out of Boston.  Been bouncing around East Coast airports and now I'm here in SC.  Fantastic server recommended a local brew (which I wasn't thrilled about), so I went with a ShockTop.  For breakfast, I had the fried chicken (tenders), on buttermilk biscuits.  You get two w/3 tenders and a side of home fries.  Sooooo good.  Very reasonable prices too for the airport.  Nice whiskey selection as expected.  You got time, stop in.  I'm sure you'll be happy."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Ordered a pound of chicken wings and got 7 wings- supposed to come with celery and when I asked for it the waitress rudely said they didn't have any without any alternative option. After asking again for another option she finally brought out some celery- obviously didn't want to put the effort in the first place to bring out the full order. My son ordered the Buffalo Chicken Wrap and there was no buffalo sauce in the wrap- just too much lettuce, ranch and blue cheese with a  few small chunks of chicken. Haven't ever had a restaurant experience where everything went wrong until tonight. This place is abusing the fact that they're located in an airport and most of their customers are one time customers that won't be returning."}
{"text":"If you happen to be in Terminal E of the Charlotte Airport and have over an hour to kill before your next flight departs, I would recommend visiting this spot for a quick bite to eat and a thirst quenching beverage. 

There really isn't that much on the menu when compared to the stand alone franchise but it is enough to tide you over until you get where you are going. The only set back here is finding a seat and hoping you could eat and drink before your flight gets ready to depart. 

This is my second time dining here and both times have been a good experience."}
{"text":"Stopped here early in the morning on a Tuesday to chill on a layover.  I was lucky to have this establishment near my gate (E9). Wasn't really feeling a cocktail but then I saw it - the Moonshine Mary. Bartenders description was \"it ain't Grandpappy's Moonshine, but it hits the spot!\" Damn right it hit the spot - I'm a new fan of Moonshine Mary's! Three drinks later I was nicely lathered up for my next flight! This wouldn't of been possible without Brad the Bartender behind the wheel. Worth stopping by!"}
{"text":"The black and blue burger with slaw was good. I liked the burger flavor, fresh beef, not frozen patties. Slaw was genorus and ok. End of lunch hour so service was good. Guy next to waited forever, choked down food and ran. So mixed food timing. Prices airport prices, burger, slaw soda and 18.00, but sit down and good , if you have time."}
{"text":"This is the worst  breakfast I have ever had and the service wasn't any better. Save your money and go to McDonald's."}
{"text":"I waited at least 10 minutes to be seated, not because it was busy but because nobody was there to help me. I think the hostess went on a break and nobody else acknowledged me. When finally seated,  the waitress was very nice. I ordered a burger, and it was just OK. The fries were not very good. Kind of soggy and had no flavor. Absolutely nothing to rave about. On subsequent layovers there has been a band playing, and the place is totally packed. I don't think it's because of the food, But if you have hours to kill you might as well go listen to the band. This place was just OK, and I probably would not go back."}
{"text":"Well it's an airport joint so I didn't expect much and on that score, Whisky River delivers. Just terrible airport food and short pours. The bland, overcooked burger was bathed in \"guac\" that I suspect had been stored for a month in a 55-gallon barrel that was previously used to hold stale oil or unfortunate gangster corpses, along with a generous dump of a some indiscernible \"chipotle\" sauce (which I suspect has less to do with chipotle peppers and perhaps more to do with the contents of the mop bucket after a Chipotle restaurant's late night cleanup. It all came delivered on a Wonder bun and came with a side of tasteless, anemic fries. 

I admit that I get sucked in by anything that has \"whisky\" or \"whiskey\" in the name, suspecting that I can at least get a tasty libation. But either the bartender is missing a finger or they have children pouring at the bar. A single is also known as \"one finger\", principally because you measure it according to the thickness of, well, a real finger. But if you're digitally impaired, I guess you have to wing it. 

This place just totally sucks."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. First, a large local beer is $14!! Of course, you don't know that you've spent $28 for 2 beers until you get the check. I get that higher prices should be expected at an airport but that is ridiculous. Second, a burger cooked to medium should not be bright red and cold to the touch in the middle. Third, apparently they soak their burger buns in the sink before putting burgers on them. To top it all off, the service is well below average, even for an airport joint.

The only reason for 1 star (vs no stars) is the fact that they had a single local beer in tap and one of the bartenders was easy on the eyes."}
{"text":"I had a layover at the Charlotte airport and decided to get some food. This place, located in Terminal E, wasn't far from my gate so I decided to give it a try. From the outside, it somewhat reminded me of the bar on the old TV show, \"Cheers.\" There were plenty of seats around the full, large bar. The bar was pretty decent in size and restaurant had a host stand right at the entrance where you were greeted upon entry an taken to a seat. It was pretty crowded and I don't believe there was a wait but since I was alone, I decided to take a seat at the bar. This was about 830pm. 

SERVICE: The bartender was an older Caucasian looking woman; short in stature. She was pleasant, timely and efficient. I asked about 3 different whiskey drinks and one of them she didn't recommend because it came in a souvenir glass and she said it was quite costly. Thus, I opted for one of the others selected. I noticed there were no prices on the menu. I didn't want to be \"that customer\" who says, \"Ummmm, how much is this?\" Also, I expected to pay a bit more because I was at the airport so I didn't bother to ask. The bartender checked on me as needed, my food came out in a timely manner and as soon as I was ready to check out, the bartender gave it to me in a timely fashion.

FOOD: I ordered the brisket grilled cheese with broccoli. It was great! Very flavorful and filling. The bread was perfectly toasted, not soggy like some places and the portion size was appropriate. The broccoli was \"al dente\"...just the way I like it. 

Now on to my complaint.......I did NOT expect to pay $15 for a whiskey drink (that was not hand crafted) that was served in a basic highball glass. I mean...didn't I say above that she recommended me NOT to get the some in the souvenir glass because it was \"expensive.\" Well....\"I\" think $15 is pretty expensive.....or maybe that's just me. So after having ordered two of those, I was stunned. But what was I supposed to do aside from pay for it? I mean, my glass was empty. With all of that being said, I definitely think it can be viewed as somewhat of a rip off due to the fact that many travelers want alcohol and no prices are on the menu. I would return; but I would drink water instead. Tap water that is... no bottled water."}
{"text":"Food ok.  Server was a bit grouchy.  Had an early flight. They were not open. We asked when they openef and were told 6 am. They were put off when we pointed out it was after 6.  Then had to wait longer because our server was telling jokes with a coworker.  A different server pointed out she had people in her section.  

Breakfast omelet was fair at best."}
{"text":"This was a quick stop before boarding our 7 hour flight. The place was packed but we managed to grab two seats at a high top communal table. 

Our server was with us in a minute, delivered drinks promptly and our sandwiches shortly thereafter. My grilled chicken sandwich was AOK. 

This is not fine dining but was great for a drink, and a bite while seated. It IS in the airport, so it's loud, busy and needs to be treated in a category of its own. 

The terminal could use a bigger bathroom (there is none in the restaurant) and the menu could use a couple of healthier choices...but we got what we needed and moved on! Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place was better than I expected. Seating is tight since airports haven't figured out how to make space for carry on baggage..... I mean it doesn't take a genius. I was going for something lighter so I got the Cobb salad. It was VERY good and packed with meats! I heard the lady next to me who ordered chili say it was tasteless but the salad was ok!"}
{"text":"We had a pretty poor experience here. My burger had no toppings. When they say Mushroom Swiss Burger, that's literally all you get. No condiments or anything. Our sides were cold when they came out. The bread was stale. The burger was smaller than other restaurants of a similar style. This restaurant could do way better if they didn't skimp the details. Based on the quality of the food, the prices are crazy."}
{"text":"I wasn't really impressed with anything here - mainly the service. I really believe someone needs to teach the staff about customer service! Maybe it was just a bad day or something. Therefore - based on selection and price - I may return one day!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot on my layovers. Buffalo chop salad is my go to. Amazes me how much airport restaurants can charge for wine, I could buy 2 bottles for the price of 1 large glass!"}
{"text":"Ever so often you get a airport restaurant that takes time to help the veggie eaters.

Whiskey river has an amazing Chipotle burger with the option of a veggie Patty and barbecue fries.

Awesome combination.

Yolanda was the server and Cathy the host ! Both were great !! 

Will surely drop in next time I'm flying by CLT ?(_)?"}
{"text":"We were in, out, and on our way quickly despite how packed it was. The food was actually quite good despite the poor presentation. Yes the drinks are pricey but hey, it's an airport. The staff was mostly just business. Get the order, get the food, see ya later! Overall not a bad spot to spend that extra layover hour."}
{"text":"Food here is typical, nothing special but where they excel is service and drinks. The Bloody Mary here is to die for. Also the bartenders will pull your leg to make anything you get a double but to each his own. The drinks come strong from the get-go."}
{"text":"Returning home on Red Eye from Las Vegas... after eating at some of the best- \" expensive\" restaurants in Vegas.... none of which could serve a boiled or soft scrambled egg half way decent (most of the time they were cold) .... right here in the Charlotte Airport, we had the best scrambled eggs and strawberries on our trip for a fraction of the cost.  First time we have eaten here, we'll try it again.  Our server was attentive and friendly as well."}
{"text":"2 burgers and 4 margaritas was $98. This was not special food, not special service, and the drink prices weren't on the menu. Shame on that waitress! She got a horrible tip and I don't even care. No one should be spending $100 at a stupid airport. Come on. But why should they care? Patrons won't be usuals because it's at an airport. Have some decency people."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in because it smelled good. We were seated quickly and the waitress took our order. Food was ok but not great. The staff and the waitress was not very nice"}
{"text":"Pretty good sized place for an airport establishment.  Lots of seating.  Menu had a lot of options, and all pretty good bar/airport food, but nothing truly awesome.  Only thing lacking was the service.  For a place that should cater to folks looking for a quick bite between flights, it took a long time to place our order and to get our check.  I would try it again though with some time to kill in the airport."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst place in the Charlotte Airport. Common food, and honestly the most obnoxious and slow servers in the entire complex. Avoid at all costs. The mexican place at the end of the B concourse is far better"}
{"text":"Wanted a sit down restaurant in the charlotte airport. Didn't want fast food. This place was very busy but figured lets give it a try. Extremely small menu. It's bar food. A few burger and fries. Wings salad etc. not much to choose from. The burger was definitely a frozen party. Fries were ok. But service was horrible. Though it was busy there was more than enough staff working and some standing around doing nothing yet the waitress never came to see if everything was ok. I flagged her down to ask for napkins and she never brought any then I finally had to flag her down to get my bill. I would have got a dessert if the waitress had ever come back to check on me. But I said forget it. Next time I am in this airport which is every few months I will not go here to eat  

Best part was the pic I took of the food looked nice."}
{"text":"It was 10 PM and we felt pretty lucky to find somewhere still doing full service. We got the pulled pork sandwich and the brisket grilled cheese and thought they were just fine, especially for airport food. The brisket was a little saltier than I would have personally preferred. However, plus one star for some really excellent service. Everyone was warm and welcoming, and our water glass never went past half full without being refilled."}
{"text":"Here's how I look at it - it's 4 stars for airport dining. Should I compare it to dining out in the real world where a bottle of water isn't $5?  Or should I compare it to the fare located in this locked down area?  You know, like prison food. Do you think prisons compare it to food on the outside or to other facilities?

So this was a good salad. Probably small for some people but it was perfect for lunch. Salad and two Diet Cokes were $17. That's a total bargain in and out of an airport. The chicken definitely tasted buffaloie (saying it tasted like buffalo sends the wrong message - you get my point though: you could tell it was buffalo but my mouth is not on fire) and the veggies seemed fresh and clean. No brown lettuce. Waitress was nice. And I was in and out in about half an hour.

My personal rule for dining in any airport where there's a waitress is to have an hour between then and my flight. Anything less you're worried the kitchen may be too slow when it's really just on Reginald outside the airport timing. 

Whiskey River is in Terminal E and once you get her you may not be up for traveling back to another Terminal. If you come in something else it always seems like E is the farthest away. It is the only place to dine currently in E with wait staff which to me usually means the only place you can grab a drink. 

Cheers."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying WR at the airport. Slightly disappointed. The service was ok. My husband got the Chipotle Burger. He liked it but it's messy so be prepared. I got the brisket grilled cheese and I didn't care for it at all. Salty and strange BBQ flavoring. Fries were good though."}
{"text":"Decent spot to grab a bite to eat in the Charlotte airport. We had pickle chips, and chicken fingers. We also enjoyed beer and wine. I had wanted a glass of rosé, but they were out of both! I guess I shouldn't expect \"Whiskey River\" to have a large wine selection. I enjoyed a glass of sparkling, and everyone else had beer. The service was good especially being in an airport! They got us in and out quickly in time for our flight."}
{"text":"God awful service. Slow and unacceptable. Bartenders are forgetful and no ESPN on TV. To too it all off,they charged me the wrong tab and when I called them out, all I got was a smile and a \"my bad\". 
So yeah, overall it sucks! I'm so glad I'm never coming here again. F*** places like this."}
{"text":"This place is a good bet for a sit down meal if you have time to kill at the airport. I would make sure you at least have an hour to eat, the service is not the quickest. There also isn't really that much room to put your bags or carry-ons down.

Once we were seated, a server came by a few minutes later. I really think she might have been one of two people serving the whole place. Trying her best to keep up with the demand, she brought our drinks back quickly and took our order. We waited around 15 minutes for a cobb salad and buffalo chicken wrap. The cobb salad was huge and packed with a ton of toppings, just how I like it. I got asked by many people waiting in line for the adjacent pizza place if it was as good as it looked, yes, yes it was. My husband said the chicken wrap was decent. 

The only problem we had was getting refills on our drinks and the check, both took a little longer than wanted."}
{"text":"First time at an airport bar that I felt that I was an inconvenience to the bartender. I would have stayed and ordered more drinks but the bartender made it clear that she was in no mood to have me as a customer. 
Warning to anyone not from NC: stay clear of this place."}
{"text":"Had a great mushroom Swiss burger at both visits. First time sat at the bar and had great service while watching hockey on one of the many TVs above the bar. 2nd time sat out on the outside counter area by the mechanical bull and had equally great service. They can be crowded and busy depending on flight traffic but I would definitely come here again if my layover allowed. A nice spot in an otherwise run-down airport. Didn't realize the specialty drink on the menu I ordered was more than my burger so check the prices first if that's a concern."}
{"text":"This place must be know for there drinks, unfortunately i was here for breakfast and what sounds so good before eating became a huge disappointment after.  I had on referral by the hostess the honey glazed chicken biscuit.  I should have really understood what she was saying when she mentioned that she really loves chicken...its like me with Mac & cheese, you basically have to destroy it before i wont eat it. Man sitting here smh about them having no flavor what so ever, its honey, how can you make honey not sweet....look at the picture it looks like its glazed over twice, but nothing...biscuit wasnt good either...texture great but again no sort of flavor.  Hopefully next time I'm at that airport I will read over my review and find a better place."}
{"text":"Had a couple of hours to kill.  Needed lunch.  Perfect.

Had the pulled pork sandwich.  It was LOADED with pork.  Tender and very tasty.  My only con is the sauce.  I personally would like to have a thicker, spicier sauce.  This one was a little bland."}
{"text":"I was surprised at how great my experience was here! Understanding that this is an airport joint, I sat down at the bar and was immediately taken care of. My water was always full, and my bartender made an extra effort to make conversation with me, along with other people at the bar. 
My food order was placed immediately (Dirty Tots!) and came out in a timely manner, which is ALWAYS really appreciated in an airport. I think that most of the apps are served in a warm cast iron mini skillet, which is a neat presentation. Taste was on point as well!  

Anyways, I can't really give this place 5 stars, but it was a really great experience to have. Glad to know that there's an adequate dining experience in lonely 'ol Terminal E."}
{"text":"As far as airport food goes, Whiskey River is better than most. I always get the Carolina Cobb salad and have not had any issues with the quality.

They always seem to be short staffed, or the hostess fails to tell the server they have sat guests in their section.  This trips service was better than normal.  They seem to be trying to rectifying this situation with the at table call buttons.  I didn't need to use the call button on this visit. Let's hope I won't need to use it in the future either."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential, and it is extremely charming, especially for being in the airport... Unfortunately, our server was not so charming... My husband and I each ordered a drink, and she seemed so frustrated from the moment we sat down... Maybe she was having a bad day, but she was not busy, nor were we being high maintenance (a mimosa, and Bloody Mary)... I would not go back unless I was stuck in terminal E for a delayed flight"}
{"text":"Four stars for service. On a long layover I prefer to have table service and take my time. Server recognized this and I have no complaints. Beer was never empty and no annoying interruptions to ask how \"everything \" is. 
Tots for an appetizer, chili for the main course. Tots were spot on. Chili was a good consistency but was far from serving temperature. A far too common problem with kitchens that don't care. 
It's an airport. I get it. No big deal. I'm happy for the table and the proper service. Proper food would only be a bonus.
There was live music too. That was super nice and I left those guys a nice tip too. Always tip your servers and musicians!"}
{"text":"I'm a big cheese grits fan so when I saw stone ground cheddar grits as part of the Big Country breakfast at Whiskey River at the Charlotte Airport, I knew that was happening :) 

The breakfast platter came with extra crispy (as requested!) bacon, ribbon sheets of delicious scrambled eggs atop killer cheese grits with a soft, freshly baked biscuit dredged in a delightful jalapeño-infused honey. It had all of the flavor and not too much spice. The biscuit soaked up the honey like a good bread pudding. 

Jennifer was an excellent server and made sure everything was cooked as I ordered it. Chef Carlos knows how to make some serious scrambled eggs and I love love love the texture, cheesiness and creaminess struck the perfect balance for me. I may just have to come back here during my next layover :)"}
{"text":"I must say , it's an attractive place in an airport but the food doesn't live up the hype. We came here for breakfast and we loved the potatoes because they were crisp to perfection however I really did not like my eggs and chicken , it kinda smelled funny and had a weird after taste so I left it be . The service was great so the three stars is for that ."}
{"text":"I was rushing for the Charlotte airport this is of my stop.
Great southern food with a large menu and drinks.
Extremely interesting decor"}
{"text":"If you have ever asked if quality barbecue could be served in an airport restaurant, look no further. You know you're on to something when you round the corner and a wall full of belt buckles awaits you. Then you look at the menu and realize all of the usual items await; brisket, pulled pork, slaw, banana pudding. I went with the pulled pork (comes with slaw AND a side) plate. For $12, I was even more surprised. When I asked what was on tap, I was told about German mead. I had to try it at least once (actually, twice). 
     The hostess and waitress were friendly and the order was out fairly quick. If you are seated in just the right spot, you almost forget you're at a airport. The live music helped with that. I will be sure to visit the second location (in Charlotte) if I am ever in town for a day.

*Insider's Tip
-Seating is basically \"fill a empty chair\". If there's one beside you, then expect company. If you have a personal space bubble, either have a couple of friends with you or pick another spot."}
{"text":"We stopped in Whiskey River for a quick bite between flights. The restaurant was uncomfortably warm which might have been  the reason the wait staff was less than pleasant. They were all 'sit down and don't bother me' from the moment we walked in. When they brought something to the table, there was little if any eye contact and none of the typical small talk you usually get from the waitress. We watched her clean multiple tables while our drinks sat at the bar getting warm even though we had mentioned that our flight was not too far out and so we were In a bit of a hurry. My wife got the brisket quesadillas which were great. I got the buffalo chicken wrap with tots. Unfortunately the ONLY thing I could taste in mine was the buffalo sauce, and the tots were overcooked and cold. When I told the manager about it, they swapped my dish for quesadillas and after that the waitress warmed up a bit... but next time I am in the Charlotte airport, I will taxie on by Whiskey River."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite during layover.  I waited to be seated,  then they finally take me center stage in front of live band which by the way sounded awesome but my head couldn't take all of that noise.  I made my way to another table waited for it to be cleaned.... looong story short,c Witter tooooo long,  server never greeted me,  never took drink order and NEVER took my food order.  The bus boy offered to take my order.  I thanked him and went next door to the pizza joint, where I was promptly served. Thanks to them,  I ate and was able to make it to my flight in a timely manner."}
{"text":"It shouldn't take this long for anything at an airport but at Whisky River it does. More than ten minutes of queue to get a seat in the \"outside\" area, which seemed to be due to only having a single host working the stand. His side job of wiping menus took up much of his time. At this point, I really just wanted to see how long it would take.

Dale Jr. needs to get his pit crew working on expediting things here.

Located halfway up the E concourse where the regional jets and the prop planes park."}
{"text":"This is in the airport. The place was packed and I saw two servers. The one I had was rude and inattentive, probably because of the situation the management set him up with. The manager came to speak with me, and given his snotty attitude, I have nothing nice to say. This place is severely mismanaged. I don't recommend stopping here unless you have at least 90 minutes to kill. Steer clear."}
{"text":"Got in early on the red eye from Phoenix, so we were the first folks here. I think our breakfast was leftovers from last night. Except the eggs. They were fresh. But the grits, sausage and bacon tasted like they were cooked yesterday. 
Maybe not. But if they were cooked today they were poorly done."}
{"text":"Terrible omelet. It was over cooked and undersized. 
They should rename it to the Buffalo crap omelet."}
{"text":"ate at the one in the CLT airport. Wasn't too bad. The air wasn't really working that great, but there was a spot for me to plug in my phone for a charge. Get the Nachos and the Salmon."}
{"text":"I have a three hour layover so I asked two airport associates, separately (a man and a lady) where to go to relax and have breakfast. They both said Whiskey River. I ordered the Big Country Breakfast and that's stone grits, two eggs, bacon or sausage and toast. I requested a half order of bacon and a half order of sausage and received the substitution at no charge. Everything tasted really good. I enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"Food is average drinks are average. But it is in the airport and at that The busiest part of clt. Easy seating and the food comes out fast."}
{"text":"After multiple times passing by and not been able to stop, today was the day. Well, this is a 2.5 star place. The environment is nice, the server Stephani did a wonderful job. 

If it is a whiskey bar I will be expecting a better variety, but is just a regular bar with few Bourbons, whiskey and Scotch/Malts. The \"cocktails\" look better on the menu compared to their taste. 

I ordered a Shrimp wrap Cilantro-like based with Parmesan fries and i can say probably The food in the carts at the terminals was better. The fries were re-heated and the Parmesan was bad quality, the ketchup wasn't even making them taste better. The wrap was very cold, not even slightly cold. For my taste, I would have preferred it a little warm. So basically I ate the inside and there were like 3 shrimps. Kind of pricey for what I got. 

If you just want to chill prior to your departure just stick to the wine list."}
{"text":"I came here during a layover. Kersten was my waitress and she was great! I couldn't decide between the brisket grilled cheese or dirty tots. She recommended the dirty tots with the shredded brisket (instead of pork). AND IT WAS AMAZING. That BBQ sauce with a little heat and the brisket? Mm. Exactly what I wanted. And they've got some good local beers. Definitely don't let the low stars scare ya. They're worth it."}
{"text":"Solid airport dining, but I have had better. I enjoy the burgers. If you are at gate d or e, it's the way to go."}
{"text":"What a delightful experience. Me and my friend enjoyed some live music while sipping on a couple dirty Shirley's (Shirley temple with vodka!). The band was radiating positive energy and the staff were quite friendly. Oh and the chicken quesadilla was scrumptious!"}
{"text":"I set down here to weather a long layover.  I wasn't overly hungry, so I had the chili.  Setved in a small griddle, it was homemade and good.  The decor was fun.  Now the issues: the chili came with a plastic spoon and no napkin.  When I  made a complaint, the waitress produced a spoon quickly, explaining that wait staff were throwing them away, so they were short!  Second issue: my double bourbon on the rocks was very small, although disguised by the ice.  Ill go elsewhere next time."}
