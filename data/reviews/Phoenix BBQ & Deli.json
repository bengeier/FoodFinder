{"text":"Now for the bad news, this restaurant is out of business! It is a sad day. It appears to be abandoned for whatever reason(s)."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for the past month, had the brisket twice, the beef sandwich and the rib tips. I've enjoyed them all with the \"hot\" sauce which isn't hot unless you think ketchup burns your mouth. I will continue to go here as long as i still go to school out that way, or untill the BBQ place that replaced Shakey jakes opens up.   The currly fries are probably the best side to get, I like the slaw and beans but the fries are the best.  they also do catering"}
{"text":"I ordered the Phx Cheesesteak combo which came with a ridiculous amount of curly fries (greasy and a bit undercooked) and a small drink.  The brisket was very good with an appropriate amount of bbq sauce.  The lunch was rather costly.  At just under $10 for a lunch combo, this is a place I will not frequent very often."}
{"text":"Its no Texas. I had a hankerin' for some B B and Q and I knew it would fall short, but it was expected so I guess it is what it is. I find it weird that a BBQ joint would not serve beer. Beer and wine license would increase sales and headcount. I mean c'mon! Eh, i liked brisket."}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite BBQ in the valley. We have tried all the popular standby's like Hap's and Honey Bears and while we like them the flavor doesn't add up. The only down fall is that the food is a bit inconsistent. We eat their regularly and the food varies which tells you it is made fresh but the quality isn't always at the height we know it can be. However, we keep going back and will continue to! No BBQ sauce compares."}
{"text":"So my driver was going to be in the area of 31st Ave and Indian School and I gave her an order to pick up at Haps.  Well Haps isn't there any more, the web site still shows the original East side location, and she mentioned she thought another bbq place had moved in where Tom's had closed up a while back.  She called and read the menu to me and said it looked like everything was still in place from when it was Tom's.  I ordered a large beef/pork combo sandwich and a side of beans.  Quote from their menu \"We've been told many times more meat falls off our BBQ sandwich than most places put on theirs.\"  I've seen more meat on an Arby's regular roast beef and Arby's regular bun might even be bigger.  It wasn't bad per say but it wasn't as good as Tom's that used to occupy the building and no where near the level of Hap's or Honey Bears.  The beans had almost a burnt secondary taste to them.   They get 2 stars instead of one just because it was edible.  But I am still hungry."}
{"text":"I personally will pick phoenix bbq over honey bears or any other BBQ in phoenix. The portions are large and very well done. The only reason I don't give it a five is a slight quality variation issue in some of there dishs. The rib tips for example are sometimes slightly lower in quality but only in comparison to other occasions. I eat here every other week or more. With delicious sauce, amazing well done meats, and amazing salads an original salads I would give it five stars but I am being picky"}
