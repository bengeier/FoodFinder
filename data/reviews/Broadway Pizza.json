{"text":"The driver was half hour late..time given 45 Minutes. ..the address clearly stated north grandview not grandview. ..so food cold n one of our hoagies literally had only one piece or Ham on half n no ham on other half only lettuce n tomato.  Did the driver eat it on the way? So glad we are moving out of the area. Grand Central pizza will get all our business."}
{"text":"The food is horrible. Every time we order we never get the correct food. Last order was wings and fries the wings were over cooked and the fries were burnt. Will never order from there again."}
{"text":"Broadway Pizza is right down the street and the food is very good and The customer service is even better."}
{"text":"I've always liked Broadway Pizza. If you have a crowd to feed like I do, this is the place to get a ton of food and save some money at the same time. Their Belly Buster is a HUMONGOUS round pizza that has 16 cuts in it. For a dollar less, you can get a Sicilian Square pizza that is rectangular with the same 16 cuts. Toppings can get a bit pricey but one or two keeps it affordable. They don't have a delivery charge but they have a minimum delivery. Their baked hoagies are pretty good, too. Their food is pretty consistent every time I order from there. My most liked part is you can use your credit/debit card over the phone when you order and tip the driver either on the card or in cash when he delivers. The only drawback I have with them is on their fried appetizers such as zucchini planks or mushrooms, they put salt on them. When I inquired the next time I ordered something whether they could leave the salt off, they said okay, but the zucchini was still salty.  Other than that, my husband really likes their wings and I can feed all four of my teenaged kids with one pizza."}
{"text":"Very good foods. Delivery is extra fast and their delivery man is very polite and promote. I know it's only pizza but it's good."}
{"text":"I wasnt very impressed with the pizza, it was plan, sause wasnt very good at all. I ordered breaded mushrooms and they were really gross and frozen burned. I honestly have to say this was my first and last time ."}
