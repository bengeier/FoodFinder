{"text":"I went in today about 2:30 pm and wanted to eat a shwarma sandwich, but the waitress said that they were out.  So I ordered the chicken wrap.  It was not that flavorful I thought compared to chicken shwarma sandwiches I've had.  I was happy that we were getting a middle eastern arabic restaurant near siskey Y, but saddened that my order was not flavorful.  The sandwich lacked tahini yogurt sauce and arabic pickles that traditional arabic food has.  It was basically grilled chicken with tabouleh salad rolled in khubs (arabic pita).  Not too happy!
Entree's are so pricey, for a small 'cafe'.  Lamb and kabob platters are outrageously pricey.  Its not a full fledged restaurant that you need to have prices like this.  1/2 of Lebanese rotisserie chicken costs $10.  I used to buy a full Lebanese rotisserie chicken from Middle Eastern Deli (long time ago on Sharon Amity), for $7.  
They should not be out of anything as they just opened!! LOL!
I will try again to give them another chance."}
{"text":"I always ask the owner to recommend something from the menu. Sometimes they have a daily special not listed. The hummus is great. The vegetarian food has always been very good. I would eat here anytime. Never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I'm appalled by some of these low ratings! It must be true what they say, reviews are unfair as it's usually unhappy, bitter customers who take the time to write them. 

I've been wanting to go to this place for a while, and now that I have, I could kick myself for not going sooner! In fact, I just had such a good experience there that I came home and created a Yelp account so I could brag on them. This place is legit. The cook I spoke with today is from Jerusalem and the food is truly authentic.  I thought the pricing was fine, I mean, come on people, they have to make a living and the food industry is hard enough as it is. If you wanted a $1 sandwich, you should've gone to McDonalds!

Service was fabulous, I don't think I've ever had so many restaurant employees be so nice to me. And that falafel was TO DIE FOR! I've never had pita quite like that. It was the opposite of the kind you can buy in a store or that I usually get in Mediterranean restaurants...it was actually soft. Who knew pita bread didn't have to be rock hard? And the tahini sauce was mmm mmm good!

So, in conclusion, GO THERE. I Just ate lunch there and I'm already craving it for dinner!...And for heavens sake you sensitive reviewers, cut people some slack. Even people in customer service, no, ESPECIALLY people in customer service, get overwhelmed, or frustrated, or have bad days. Do you not?!"}
{"text":"There have been some recent very negative reviews about this fantastic restaurant that are frankly shocking to me. My family and I and several of my coworkers/friends are regulars here. I was as well at their prior location in Matthews, NC where it did great business but was too small to meet demand. I grew up in NJ, not the Midwest (where quality Mediterranean choices may very well be limited but never living there I can't confirm that). I do know that NJ has many and I tried them all. Now, mind you Yelp and the menu handout list different closing times.  That should be fixed without a doubt because handout actually states 8pm close Mon-Sat and 7pm Sunday. Yelp says closing 9pm. The restaurant may go there eventually but I think the owner was attempting to make an accommodation by providing service to a late arrival when in fact he likely would have been closed or close to it for the night otherwise. Perhaps that explains why there was only one customer at 8:05 on a Fri/Sat night. Here's the thing...rather than running home and ripping into a quality establishment and potentially damaging its reputation and that of its prince of an owner....give it a 2nd chance because otherwise I have to wonder if it there was more to the tone of these questionable reviews than meets the eye. 

Jerusalem Cafe is an overall excellent choice...no place is perfect every moment of every day, but this restaurant has excellent food and extremely nice people on its team.  And that is coming from a regular who knows good food from around the globe and is not one to write internet reviews but felt it was worth doing so in this situation.

A 1 or 2.....really???? I don't think so!"}
{"text":"Solid vegan options, would recommend they advertise that fact. Would get a ton more business. They can not put the olive oil from the top of the hummus if you ask for anyone watching their omega 6 intake."}
{"text":"Customer BEWARE! This place is not owned by Jewish people! Hashish pipes and other questionable items adorn the place. You cannot see the food being cooked. The whole place is highly questionable."}
{"text":"I've been curious about this place for a while and finally decided to take the plunge one weekday in the early evening. The decor does leave a lot to be desired, but they've got some interesting artifacts. They seem to get more take-out orders than sit-in diners. I used a BOGO coupon and ordered the kufta (ground seasoned beef) and chicken kabob with hummus and garlic sauce, with a side of baba ghanouj; pita bread was provided as well. The presentation was fantastic. The kabobs were very flavorful and they didn't skimp on the hummus. There were little pools of olive oil and veggie garnish... Yum. The only thing I didn't like was the baba ghanouj. I'd never had it before and, according to my server, the burnt aroma/taste is normal. Oh well!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot to grab a gyro. The server was very friendly and I was seated right away. I asked for extra onion on the gyro and it had none, but not the end of the world..  Still a tasty treat. That being said, it's actually pretty pricey for the amount and quality of food that you get. I spent $29 for a gyro, lamb plate and one sweet tea. The gyro doesn't even come with fries. I'd definitely come more often if the prices were a bit more in line with the food and location."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. Unfortunately, it just wasn't that good. For an appetizer, we ordered Jerusalem potatoes. They were ok. Almost too lemony for my taste but my boyfriend thought they weren't lemony enough. For my main course, I ordered the gyros and chicken kabob plate. It came with fries and hummus. The chicken was way too well done, dry, and without a single spice on it. The gyros was preformed rectangles of meat. The hummus wasn't memorable. I wish restaurants would serve hot pita instead of cold pita!  After the meal was served, I ordered a side of rice. Which should have been pre-made. I never received it. 

My boyfriend ordered the variety kabob plate with Kufta and chicken. It was the same chicken as my plate. He liked the Kufta ok. Also came with hummus and taboulea. It was ok. Nothing great at all. 

Other than forgetting the rice, service was good. Server offered to help select a dish and answered our questions. Our drinks were refilled promptly. 

The interior is small. Can only seat about 8 tables with about 3 of them only being two tops. It's quite dark in the restaurant as well.

Overall, the food just wasn't very tasty. It was all quite bland. I do enjoy middle eastern cuisine so it isn't that I just don't like the cooking style. The entrees were also bit pricey. There are other middle eastern restaurants in town with better food."}
{"text":"WORST Mediterranean food ever......!!!

Chicken kabobs were too dry and burned. Quantities not enough even for a single person. Only hummus was the thing which made me felt like eating Mediterranean food... 
Server was in so much hurry that forgot to give water to kid. 

P.S- To post a comment is mandatory to give a rating, so have to give a star... This place don't even deserve one star."}
{"text":"Ok, I have been coming here at least once a week beginning a few weeks after this placed opened. Living a mile away makes this a no brainier for Tuesday night dinners. 
Ihab, one of the owners and main chef knows me by heart and usually just makes me something not on the menu when I am unsure what I want. The food is quite delicious and this was my first time dining on food from this region. My favs are the rotisserie chicken with rice, salad, and a side of hummus and that lovely garlic butter stuff. Next would be the variety grill with 2 chicken skewers. The lamb special, which is lamb and veggies over the rice is REALLY GOOD!!!! Ceidra has been the main waitress/hostess for the last 6 months or so and she is awesome! Always knows what I want.....Some Friday nights there is a belly dancer that performs live dances to wonderful music. The highlight of this place for me, was one night while dining, Ihab decided to sit at my table and have his dinner with me while we chatted about random things!!!w e normally joke and chat it up for 10-15 minutes every time I come in anyway, but I am glad he is comfortable enough to dine with his regulars. An awesome night and this review should convince you why I'm here every Tuesday night!!! I have to agree that while I am a fan of the LOOK of the interior, I do miss being able to look in the kitchen and observe/interact with the staff and owners....

P.S. I hope I spelled his name right!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. The food was really quite good but the service was below average and the atmosphere non-existent. Our table had two entrees but they came out at least 20 minutes apart. In fact the first entree was finished for a while before the second came. Also the waitress did not come back to check on us much and even when she walked by she failed to notice our empty drinks. Finally, my sister asked and got a refill, but she didn't bring me a drink even though I had asked as well and I had to ask again.  That time my mother asked as well but she never got a refill. Overall, it was a very mixed experience."}
{"text":"This was the worst food I have ever had hat. I'm hungry for some good Mediterranean food and what I got was a sad semblance. Spinach pie that we ordered was made with bread dough and very little damage inside the tart shaped bread rolls  the lamb dinner that was recommended by the owner had only six small pieces of lamb and that included pieces of bones. It was put over their rice but there was no sauce or gravy on the lamb though it was tender there was no sauce and not much flavor. The basmati rice that came with it didn't have a lot of flavor and had  hard crunchy things that I don't know what they were. The lentil soup was lentil puree and also had little hard things in it. The pita bread was stale and the tzatzakii was about the only thing that they did good. It's a good thing we got lentil soup because I  poured the soup on top of the rice to make it taste halfway decent. I would have been better off going to McDonald's or eating a bowl of Cheerios. Oh and by the way it the salad wasn't very good either I'm not sure what kind of dressing they used but they did not wash the salad and it tasted very bitter. I guess Palestinian style is not my type of food. YUK And all that for the overpriced amount of $28 plus tax one meal one piece of spinach pie and one small bowl of soup. If it weren't so far I would go there to get my money back but it's not even worth the gas to get there from Fort Mill. Don't let the word Jerusalem fool you it's a Palestinian restaurant and it barely deserves one star."}
{"text":"The food here is simply delicious! Don't come for a fancy dinner, come for the food! The people working here are very friendly. The food is made to order and super fresh. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was tasty although we waited 38 minutes for a gyro and shawarma. Ridiculous wait time. There was only a two top waiting to get their food when we ordered, so I'm not sure how it took 38 minutes for 2 pita sandwiches- would be understandable if they were busy. Also an 8 top ordered about 10 minutes after us and managed to get their food before us. We asked for shawarma with no tahini and side of tzatiki. It came with tahini and I guess they forgot to put lettuce on it. The menu said lettuce, cucumber and tomato, but it only had tomatoes and cucumbers on it. 
I wanted to love this place. But waiting almost 40 minutes for a sandwich that wasn't even made correctly isn't giving me hope. Hopefully they can get more help and rectify the issues."}
{"text":"I went here on a lunch date with my friend.. We got there right when opened and were seated promptly.  No other customers were there but us. it was quiet with some nice music playing in the background. 
My friend ordered water and I ordered ice tea.
There was no lunch menu, but I have to say the food tasted very fresh and we didn't leave a crumb behind.
I ordered the beef shwarma pita which was juicy and had lots of good spices in it. My friend ordered the chicken pita. She didn't complain at all. She just asked for some garlic sauce because she has to eat her food with lots of different dips.  We also ordered an appetizer of falafels. 8 came on a plate. They were so good that even the kids ate them. 
The kids had chicken nuggets and fries. The fries are circled and fried. They were very crispy.
We will be back soon."}
{"text":"The food here is flavorful, fresh and tasty.  I'd say it's my favorite Mediterranean restaurant so far. Sometimes the food takes a little longer to arrive since everything is made fresh once ordered so don't get in a hurry.

The owner is very friendly but the one waitress I always see is definitely not why I keep coming - she is scatterbrained and doesn't get in a hurry.  She gets on my nerves but the food is good so I tolerate her.  

The falafel and garlic sauce is amazing.  I usually get the vegetarian plate but don't be fooled - you'll leave stuffed!  My boyfriend loves the Jerusalem potatoes and they have the best hummus in my opinion."}
{"text":"By far the best Gyro I've had in Charlotte.The french fries are amazing to boot. I hope this place stays in business for a long time"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place.  The food is absolutely amazing and the owners are so friendly and kind.  My family enjoys going here as much as possible and everyone we have brought has then made it there favorite as well.  Must go!"}
{"text":"My family and I went here today for the first time and will definitely be back!!  Two of us had the special rice with lamb and chicken. We are now hooked!!  Another person had the shawarma salad which was equally delicious!  I have had Mediterranean food in several places  and think this is one of the BEST in charlotte!!  We even took a portion of special rice to go. We WILL be back!  LOVED IT!!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has become my go-to place at least once a week. Everything that I have eaten has been fantastic! I highly recommend the falafel appetizer, the Jerusalem mixed grill, kufta wrap, and their weekend special with rice and lamb kebabs."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this cafe but it did not live up to expectations.  My chicken kabob pita was cold and the chicken was rubbery.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent Falafel and really good flavor Tahini sauce.

I also like the Kafta wrap it was very good"}
{"text":"I ate dinner las night at Jerusalem cafe . The entrees was so pricey for undecorated small cafe . I had lentil soup and kufta wrap . Not bad . Baba Ghanouj wasn't that good . But they have to work on their service . Also the guys who work on that back keep coming out and asking customers  \" how was the food ? and answering themselves \" Good \" . During my dinner they asked at least 5 times !!! Lol"}
{"text":"Ok, so I have been here multiple times since it opened. I have to say that I am a fan. The food is consistently good and the portions are large. I generally just pick up food to go so the small seating area hasn't been an issue for me. The new server is excellent. She is all about customer service. Great friendly neighborhood 'kabob house.'"}
{"text":"Really terrific food.  Grape leaves were the best I have ever had.  Hummus was terrific.  Did a sampler plate of the different pies - meat, chicken, cheese, and spinach.  All very good, but the garlic spread made them even better.  We will be back to try even more.  Heard about this place from a friend who also loved it, and now I will tell others."}
{"text":"It was ok but the ovens weren't working when we dined there so service was crazy slow. The owner/server didn't speak English well so there was a bit of a language barrier. 
Overall the food was ok but there are better places in Matthews (more expensive) after a short drive. Those often have lines and wait times though. This place did not."}
{"text":"This is the best Middle Eastern food I have found in Charlotte so far. Tried a bean dip appetizer, a mixed vegetarian plate entree and Turkish coffee. Everything was absolutely delicious. It's not exactly cheap but the higher price you pay compared to a strip mall Middle Eastern place (like La Shish Kabob on Sharon Amity) is absolutely worth it since you get a much higher quality of food here. 

I agree with some reviewers that the meat entrees are a little heavy on the rice and light on the meat, but the vegetarian plates are amazing and huge and worth the price. Mine had stuffed grape leaves, garlic sauce, falafel, two Middle Eastern spring rolls, hummus, little spinach pies... maybe something else, the list was long, and at 14 dollars a great deal. Everything was fresh, tasty and appealing to look at.

Service was a little slow but extremely friendly and helpful, which matters a lot more."}
{"text":"It's so nice to finally see \"Mediterranean\" food becoming more mainstream because, it's DEELISH and less guilt provoking than some other options. I need to frequent this place more!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I have been twice so far for the beef shawarma, Baba Ganoush and Baklava. I would love the cafe even more if they served beer and wine, but for now I'll keep coming back for the yummy nosh."}
{"text":"I ate at JC for the first time yesterday for lunch and had the Variety Grill. While the portion size was more than enough, I was not impressed with the food whatsoever. The chicken was completely burned to the point that I couldn't eat several of the pieces. The rest of the meal was ok but had hardly any flavor. I had a coupon so I didn't want to complain. Also, the service was extremely slow, esp since we were the only ones in the entire restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now and I've enjoyed it both times. The food is good but to be honest, I'm not up-to-speed on the types of food on the menu so I'm learning how to order here. Regardless, I've loved the two meals I have had. The last time i was there (two weeks ago) I had the Kufta pita wrap and it was awesome. I still think about how good it was.

I've been here two times now. The first time was good enough to bring me back and now I'm wanting to go again (three weeks later). So in my book it's worth the visit.

Lunch service is a little slow because they've only had one wait-person but it's not deal-breaker by any means. Knowing that now makes me relax more when I go there."}
{"text":"My family and I dined at JC last night. I was very excited to see a café like this open here in the Matthews area. Having spent time in the Middle East and absolutely loving the food from the different regions, it was a little disappointing and  hard for me to LOVE the food at the JC. I thought the Falafel was over fried and very disappointing. It may be the \"Best Falafel in Charlotte\" but I have had much better in other places. The entrées were OK but very pricey. I had the Tour of Jerusalam. The chicken was a little dry and the plate was mostly filled with rice.I think the price was $17 and change. For what you got, it should have been more like $10 and change. For me the Garlic Paste saved the day. It was so delicious, I smeared it on everything! I will go back and give it another try.  I do hope it succeeds. We need more places like this in the area."}
{"text":"The bomb.com! Great addition to the area, my wife is obsessed with the  veggie platter. If you want some made from scratch flavorful food, hit this place up! Only place I will eat this type of food, if that puts it in perspective."}
{"text":"JC opened recently close to where I live. It's always exciting, especially in the culinary desert of far-south Charlotte, to find ethnic (regional?) food other than Mexican or Chinese. So, I gave them a try. Spoke with the owner or co-owner (who graciously provided samples of the grape leaves and hummus: Thank You), and I promised to write a review if I liked the food. Well, I liked what I had enough to write this review. 

GRAPE LEAVES: I'm usually disappointed; however, at JC they are flavorfully cooked and moist, with the rice mixture melding nicely with the leaves.

HUMMUS: Certainly better than store bought -- and I've tried a lot of brands. Nice texture. Would benefit from more tahini and oil. 

FALAFEL WRAP: Above average, but there is just so much you can do with fried chickpeas. Where JC should focus is on the salad element. Theirs is an Arab recipe. I would suggest taking a cue from the Israeli eateries (perhaps Arab restaurants do this as well), which often offer a wide range of raw and pickled veggies to top the falafel. It's fun to \"have it your way.\" The \"Jerusalem salad\" included in the wrap was OK (not varied), and should have been more generous. Ditto for the tahini sauce. The  wrap does a decent job of containing the ingredients -- vs. the overflow effect one usually experiences with a pita pocket. 

BABA GHANOUJ: Too much lemon. Not enough tahini. Have had BG in Charlotte with a texture similar to hummus, and prefer it that way, but JC's is passable.

I'd like to see this place succeed, and I will go back. They are new, at this writing, and deserve a chance to work things out and improve. It will be interesting to see how they respond to reviews and customers' comments. Oh, and they need to get artwork (something!) up on the walls."}
{"text":"I have been two time since they opened. Good hummus, baba ganouch, falafel, gyro, shawarma sandwich. Salads had watery dressing need more salt and pita bread does not seem fresh. Could be very good but needs to improve in a few areas."}
{"text":"Great food! The falafel is excellent. The hummus is excellent. Baba ganoush is also wonderful. Authentic Mediterranean food at a reasonable price. So far I've had the falafel salad, schwarma and chicken kebab wrap as well as baba ganoush and they were all very good. Atmosphere is a little lacking. They could use some music in the dining room,  but otherwise a refreshing choice for dining in this area. 
The restaurant is visible from 521, but you have to look for it, there's not a big sign. Find it and give it a try...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We ordered Gyros and Jerusalem salad for takeout. Gyro was extremely cold and soggy, meat had a burned flavor and was served with only onion, tomato and yogurt. The Jerusalem salad was even more hideous; extremely under seasoned. Maybe take out is not their thing. We won't be giving them a second chance."}
{"text":"My wife picked up a Groupon for this spot so we gave it a go.  Started with the babaganouj, it was delicious.  Brought me back to my port call in Israel on deployment in '99.  We got the shamwarma plate with rice(with peas, golden raisins, toasted almonds), and the chicken & kufta kabob with tabouleh.  This is a tasty must stop to broaden your food horizons."}
{"text":"It's so nice to have diversity in food options especially up and down 521 (Charlotte Highway.) The Jerusalem Cafe fits the bill when one is craving quality Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food. The falafel is on point and the lentil soup and lamb dishes are delicious."}
{"text":"Tastes close to the real thing. The grilled food and the starters are great. Everything is fresh and very tasty. 

It seems to be a secret in Charlotte but if is worth the visit. We are coming back regularly."}
{"text":"I type this review as I have to finish cooking my to go order. Our chicken and beef were both under cooked. The food is also bland compared to similar restaurants. On top of these two complaints, portions were small and the food was overpriced. Really glad I had a groupon and didn't pay full price."}
{"text":"Chicken was tender and great.  Hummus amazing.  Unfortunately the service was terrible and the tabouleh had WAY too much salt."}
{"text":"This food is absolutely amazing here! Everything is fresh and excellent quality! The restaurant is low key, come as you are, so clean and very welcoming. The customer service is excellent! I am so happy this jewel popped up in my neighborhood. I believe it is the best restaurant in the area. Every item I have gotten is delicious. The Falafels are my favorite ever. Highly recommend this place! They also do to go orders by phone. A must try! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Had thought I was going to have a great lunch.  Good but did not reach great.  My biggest annoyance is having food microwaved and that's exactly how my gyro meat tasted when I got home. Certain parts of the meat were cold. I doubt I would return.  Though the meal was satisfying for my lunch. This is all constructive criticism so please do not be offended as I cook too and improvements are always welcomed."}
{"text":"We had lamb shank, hummus, moussaka appetizer and spinach pie. Lamb shank was recommended because they were huge. And they were! Shank bone was approx 8in long and full of mildly spiced succulent lamb. Hummus well balanced. This is a great spot for vegetarians. There are a lot of appetizers and salads. There is lentil soup but I did not ask if it was vegetarian. Owner is from Jerusalem & Bethlehem. Wonderful family man."}
{"text":"Excellent Mediterranean cuisine!  Service is great and is highly recommended!! Atmosphere is OK, so we usually get food to go!"}
{"text":"Very good Middle Eastern restaurant. It's one of those hole in the wall places that I'm glad to have found and will visit again. 
Authentic!!"}
{"text":"Got the chicken shawarma wrap with fries. It was ok but not anywhere close to how they make them in Jerusalem or Jordan. They have other authentic meals on the menu. Will come back and try again."}
{"text":"Went out of business.

Went out of business.

Went out of business.

Doing this to qualify as a review so it will be highlighted."}
{"text":"My parents and I are very particular about our Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food and decided to give this place a shot. Needless to say, we will DEFINITELY becoming here again. All the food was super fresh and flavorful. You can taste that it is homemade. The falafel is absolutely delicious and the hummus is a win. The tahini added a great touch as well. Portion sizes are perfect too. Can't wait to try other items on the menu!! 

Employees are very kind and service is great. The owner came out to speak with us and he was as friendly as could be. Spacious dining area and very clean. 

This place is such a great addition to the area. I'm so sick of all the pizza, wings, and fried fast food that continuously pop up everywhere. This is definitely a breath of fresh air."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate lunch here for the first time and had the lamb wraps. Lamb was fatty and tough. The rest of the wrap was okay.  Service was poor. Will not return as there are too many better options in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is the best!! We have yet to try something we did not like. Hands down the best middle eastern food I have ever had."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food!  Just a little hole in the wall in a strip shopping center but the food is as good as I have had in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Delicious food, but poor service.  We did not receive a side item with our order and the server disappeared for over 15 minutes."}
{"text":"I'm Impressed!  Fantastic Kufta Wrap! Lentil Soup, Tabbouleh, Stuffed Grape leaves, Baklava and Turkish Coffee!  That is what I had Today on my first visit!

This Wrap was the Best \"Middle Eastern\" style Wrap I have eaten in decades!  Here is why I like this one so much: 1.) OVERALL FLAVOR!  2.) The Meat was cooked to order - I was kind of watching him cook it - He said \"is Medium good?\" I said \"yes\" 3.) The Bread was something Fantastically Special, Beautiful, Fresh, Great Flavor and texture.  4.) Jerusalem \"Salad\" was the Topping - I have never had a topping like this for a Wrap and look forward to ordering Jerusalem Salad as a Salad (on a plate) next time!  5.) Tahini Sauce compliments dishes nicely when it is not overwhelming the dish - This was the first time I have ever been served Tahini in ideal ratio (thanks Mars) to the other food that made it a perfect compliment 6.) The Pickled Vegetables were on the side - YES - I like the vegetables and I like them better Outside the Wrap.  7.) It is wrapped in Bread then wrapped in foil so it is harder to spill and in case I do not clean my hands.  This Wrap gets so close to 5 yelp stars I'll call it five!

Lentil Soup!  Here is a dish I usually order anywhere that serves it!  This one is Good!  If you are a fan of mild, this is a mild one, similar to most places - I prefer more spice, though few Mediterranean places serve it spicy!

Stuffed Grape Leaves are not usually something I order and since they were handing them out to everyone I was happy to taste and see what I though of these and GLAD I did!  These were the ONLY Stuffed Grape Leaves that I enjoyed!  Very Good!

Tabbouleh is one of my favorite dishes!  This is a VERY Good one!  Looks and tastes made-to-order the way it is supposed to be!

Baklava made the way I like it - DRY! !  !  Many Greek recipes call for Honey or Syrup and many times the end result is a piece of Baklava dripping wet!  At Jerusalem Cafe they have a style closer to a Lebanese version with Pistachios piled in the center of many thin layers of Dough, little or no butter and little to no honey, nor syrup - If you are a fan of Baklava check this one out you may love it like I do!

Turkish Coffee!  Yes they have Turkish Coffee and this is a Great one, an Easy 5 yelp stars!  After drinking about half of one serving (small mug - about Espresso size) I'm glad for spell checj because I can not spell anythinj for hours after something like this, Turkish Coffee!  I'm surprised I could drive!  As with most places they do NOT serve it sweet... I asked for Sugar and my server who speaks perfect English (with a perfect American accent) assured me it was sugar - This (whatever it was - I'm assuming Sugar) was incredibly \"light\" and flaky it was very good and had ZERO aftertaste so it had to be Sugar, right???

If you are a fan of Garlic and Mayonnaise you might go crazy for their thicker than butter side of (I do not know the name of it - if it has a name) too thick to be a sauce made with Egg and Oil and garlic - I do NOT like Mayonnaise, still thought this was something special and could be a cure for Vampireism!

Small Restaurants are a favorite of mine.  This place has about 26 seats (indoors)!  They were doing plenty of take-out orders while I was here today and plenty of Dine-in as well, the weather is perfect and some were eating outside too!  

The entire staff, Both Owners (two Guys) and two ladies were all very friendly!  Each one spoke to me as I entered and approached the counter!  As long as one person speaks to me that is fine, when everyone here is that friendly I really feel welcome.  Both Owners speak English well, one has very little accent and they invite questions about their food and are glad to make suggestions!    

I have been waiting for this place to open and it was worth the wait!  I stopped by Sunday night to see if there was a sign of when the place would be opened (the sign was they were having a friends and family night, so I knew it would be soon)!"}
{"text":"Based on my limited experience.

I personally think this remodeling wasn't good planning. The remaining space is too small to fool anyone in believing it's anything else but a hole in the wall feels very confined and I'm left staring at the parking lot - which seems to be the norm around these parts. 

There's no lunch menu and $7 to $10 appetizers are way overpriced for this venue. Then again the owners seem to be a little confused on makes an appetizer ... EIGHT felafels ?!  Anyway they need to rethink the meaning of the word appetizer 

At least the Hummus and the Baba Ganush are available as so called  \"sides\" and priced and sized correctly ($4) as can be seen in picture #30. Nicely garnished with paprika,tomato, parsley and olive oil and they taste very good, a creamy hummus and the Baba had a clear flavor of roasted eggplant - which for me is the whole point of it! The bread which came with this was just triangles of pita pockets, meh. Now offer more choices as a side.

I also tried a Kafta wrap which was ok, juicier than usual  but I didn't love it. Mainly because I didn't ask first and as it turns out it's made with ground beef without any lamb meat. When asked the (very) young waitress told me the meat was grilled over an open flame but I doubt it, I thought it was cooked on a griddle. 

And the Baklava was great, in a nutshell that wraps it up. 

I'd say it's great if you live in this neighborhood but since I don't this one experience will probably be it."}
{"text":"Very pleased with my visit. I was craving falafels the day before and it was deliciously curved by the time I left."}
{"text":"Not quite as good as kebab je or zeoutonis .. But pretty decent. Baba ghanouj here is really good. They are always empty so service is always quick . 
They should reduce prices by a dollar or so per dish.. They might get more traffic. 

Closest falafel place to my house, so I will continue to go there for a quick pickup order."}
{"text":"I liked the food and the people. Ok, so it is a small cafe - if you want a fancy restaurant go somewhere else. Authentic food, tasty. However, it is a little inconsistent. Sometimes fantastic, sometime so-so. I would like to know when they serve an item what it is and if it is cooked from scratch there. I would appreciate what they have to offer. Market yourself to your customers and you will get more business."}
{"text":"My first visit was for lunch this past week. Kept it simple and ordered a falafel wrap. Great falafel and tzatziki sauce. 

The service was prompt and friendly. The decor was nice, not fancy mind you, but a decent spot for lunch or a casual dinner. 

Will definitely make this part of our regular visits."}
{"text":"Amazing! Amazing! Amazing!
Authentic! Authentic! Authentic!

I just got back from Israel a month ago from a long trip and I can honestly say that the quality of the food is just as good- if not better- and just as authentic as the food is in Jerusalem.

The Hummus is excellent- fresh, tasty, flavorful, rich, filling-just the way it should be.
Falafel is out of this world.
Recipes and ingredients are taken and passed down from generations. 

Owner/Chef is wonderfully friendly and lovely. 

***The authenticity of the restaurant includes the atmosphere- ***so note to other yelper reviewers- when you eat in Jerusalem- there's no showy music or fancy table cloths- everything is simple and focuses on the food itself and the people who you're with. 

If you want to have the best Middle Eastern food come here!!

Bravo Jerusalem Cafe."}
{"text":"Wow...  No ice for drinks.  When asked for ice, told SORRY but we do not have any more ice and should be closed.  It was 8:05 p.m. on a Saturday night.  Website and front door clearly state hours are until 9:00 pm.  I would love to leave a better review as the food was very tasty, hummus was fantastic.  However, when you have one table in your business at 8:00 on a Saturday night, you might want to try some actual good service and customer appreciation.  Sad to say this will be another one of many that will be gone in a very short period of time."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD. This is now my favorite middle eastern restaurant in Charlotte. The falafel salad with gyro meat was over the top. Save room for dessert because the baklava is outstanding."}
{"text":"Got Mediterranean plate and vegetarian combo with spinach pie appetizer. Everything was delicious and fresh. One thing I was expecting spinach pie to have feta and phyllo crust and was disappointed but might be my only exposure was up north. Was still good just not what I'm used to. Generous portions. Busy lunch crowd.  I will be visiting often. Nice dining area, simple but good seating-comfortable"}
{"text":"The server is a teenage but since it wasn't busy it was fine. I had the hummus and Jerusalem Potatoes as an appetizer and the Lamb Kabab Plate with the house rice and Tabouleh salad. Wow, my taste buds were having a party. The Tabouleh had parsley, tomatoes, cracked wheat, olive oil, lemon juice and mint. The lamb had a garnish of peas, raisins, carrots & almonds. The rice was flaky. I love the Turkish coffee and the awesome mouth watering baklava."}
{"text":"We were so happy when this place opened just around the corner from us.  The food is fresh and delicious. The first week we noticed they were open we went 3 times during the first week. They have a nice selection for vegetarians, which we love.  I love the falafel wrap, grape leaves, the salads, and the hummus a lot.  Our meat eating friends said the shawerma was flavorful as well.  The french fries are a must get as they are more like fresh chips than fries.  The staff have always been very friendly and helpful.  I will admit the atmosphere is not something that you would take a romantic date, the colors are warm and everything looks fresh and clean.  I think this place is a gem in Matthews and the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Great little mediterranean food place in Indian Land! My husband and I have ate there twice and loved it both times. We both got the chicken and lamb kabobs with rice. The hummus taste so fresh as well!"}
{"text":"We liked this place for the food and that it is convenient to our house. YAY! Very small place that looks more like a take out joint than a sit down restaurant although there are seating available. We were expecting a restaurant and when we saw how small the place it was we were afraid the food would not be good as in restaurant quality Boy were we wrong! And glad it is what it is as I look forward to coming back and getting wraps to go if I am in a bind. I had the gyro wrap. My son had the falafel wrap. He also wanted hummus and lucky for him it was part of the falafel wrap. My husband had an entree which included  tabbouleh, stuffed grape leaves and baba ganoush. Everything was delicious and authentic. Hey, I am not Mediterrean but grew up in NY. I had my share of ethnic cuisine to say that Jerusalem Cafe is the real deal. We also had pistachio baklava after our meal. Excellent as well."}
{"text":"I enjoy Mid Eastern and Mediterranean food.
The restaurant is a bit dingy and dark.
One person at the counter at lunch time and only a few diners for lunch.
The counter man was friendly and eager to answer questions about the menu, : salads, wraps, similar appetizers , sides  entrees
 kids menu, and fountain drinks.
We ordered a bowl of lentil soup, a felafel wrap and a vegetarian combo of felafel, baba ganoush, hummus and Jerusalam salad. Food was brought to the table.
Good portions, plated nicely. Lentil soup quite good as well as everything else we ordered. Felafel excellent, crunchy exterior, soft interior. Baba ganiush smokey and creamy, hummus velvety smooth.
 Not sure if the counterman went into the kitchen to prepare the food as he disappeared into the kitchen as we waited for our food.
Few products on a shelf for sales such as Mid Eastern spices, lentils etc.
I would go back again and order a lamb or chicken dish"}
{"text":"I hate it when I get a certain craving from watching the Food network! This time it was chicken schawarma and falafel! 

Scouring Yelp led me to Jerusalem Café off Weddington Road...and what a find! I saw they had falafel in my search, but the schawarma was a bonus! It's in a shopping center with a Harris Teeter and next to a TCBY. I was happy to find it was neat and clean inside, we went in and sat ourselves. There were maybe 8-10 tables inside and another 4 outside on the patio. 

Our waitress was incredibly friendly and attentive. She checked on us just enough and gave us an overview of the wines. The chef (possibly also the owner) also popped out a couple times and was also really friendly, checking to make sure we were happy with everything and to see if we needed anything. 

On to the main event - the food! We started with the falafel appetizer. The serving size was huge - 9 good sized falafels served with tahini sauce. My bad, I ate too many and was stuffed when dinner arrived! Overly excited about them, I guess. They were so fresh and homemade - possibly the best falafels I've ever had! 

For dinner I had the chicken schawarma salad and my husband had the Jerusalem mixed grill (grilled lamb, kufta, chicken with rice and veggies). Well my salad was delicious...but...I had entrée envy when I saw/smelled his! (hate it when that happens) We shared and both entrees far exceeded our expectations. I would suggest doing an appetizer (or two) and sharing the mixed grill - you would be more than full. 

I am SO happy we found this place and will definitely be back asap!"}
{"text":"Tried this new place yesterday. Was amazed at how fresh and delicious everything was--had the chicken pita with tzazkiki sauce (stuffed full of flavorful chicken and toppings--rare these days!). Also tried the tabboluleh (so fresh!) and falafel (first time ever for that--loved it).  Highly recommend the food here"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to love this place. And it's fine. Pretty good actually. But not good enough to demand an immediate return. I'll come back if dining companions want to check it out. Probably not on my own choice though. 

Falafel, chicken, moussaka and hummus were delicious. Pita was dry and thin and bland. I prefer doughy and chewy. Owners very kind. Place is clean. Little boring as far as atmosphere. But I give it credit for being something different in boring old Indian land!!"}
{"text":"Tucked into a strip mall adjacent to a grocery store and your regular assortment of salons and other small businesses, JC is a rather nondescript and unassuming middle eastern restaurant with talent in the kitchen and grill but badly in need of front-end management.

A step inside reveals a large bar which hides the kitchen and consumes major floor space.  Tables and chairs are basic and spartan, with only about 7-8 tabletops.  As others have mentioned, there is no designated space for to-go orders or a hostess/payment station.  While clean, there is little of visual interest here.

The menu, however, is much more interesting and holds a host of standard middle eastern fare.  Skewers, salads and all the sides you'd expect are here.  Prices are largely in line with the local market, though a bit more economical.  Lunch is treated no different from dinner, though you do have the options to make your wrap a combo with the addition of fries and a drink.  Their iced tea has some mint flavoring, which is understated, but quite nice.  Kudos for being willing to substitute hummus and pita here, upon my request.  

Falafel (self-proclaimed the best in Charlotte) is truly moist and flavorful.  Hummus is smooth and not overly salted.  I liked it.  I also like the picked veggies served on the side, but they would be more tasty in the wrap.  

Service, though, has been wildly uneven during lunch times, driven largely by the amount of help on scene.  The owner's wife is typically there serving and, while concerned, becomes quickly overwhelmed if she is the only help for both take-outs and the tables.  When the cooks have to deliver their own dishes to the table, you know its bad.  This is largely not problem during off times, but a full house is both a bain and a blessing, I suppose.  

Still, a good middle eastern restaurant is not the most plentiful option in town, and it's good to have another here.  Hopefully attention can be placed on the front of house so the kitchen can continue to show their talents as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVED this place!  This was our first encounter with middle eastern food, and I am so grateful they made it such a wonderful experience!  We had the falafel as an appetizer, which was amazing.  We each ordered an entree (I think I had the Tour of Jerusalem or something like that) and let me just say that the garlic sauce is to DIE for. Seriously, just add it to anything for instant deliciousness.  Char-grilled meats and veggies over rice, very flavorful side dishes... I raved about it the entire night.  Ben says I groaned over my food as I ate, and I must sheepishly say it's probably true.  We went all out and ordered baklavah for dessert, which our waiter made very sure to emphasize that it is NOT as sweet as \"that Greek stuff\"... lol, cracked us up.  Highly recommend if you enjoy flavorful food and aren't too caught up in whether your table has a tablecloth. Seriously, if you skip this place because the front of house isn't up to your standards, you're missing out on some tasty food. And that would be a shame."}
{"text":"What a weird little place. The arrangement of this place could not be more awkward: when getting something to go you place your order thru a 6 inch tall slit in the wall positioned so low you have to bend down to see who you are talking to. But to even access that slit you have to lean over a statue placed in front of the \"window\" area. To get their attention to place the order they have a bell for you to ring on the other side of the slit that you can use if you duck and your arms a long enough. 

I've been there before but every time you have to call ahead to make sure they are making what you want to eat from their menu. about 65% of the time they do not have what you want. 

Yesterday I ordered a whole rotisserie chicken and a 3 side item \"meal\" with baba ghanoush, salad, and rice. When I got home, we discovered there was no baba ghanoush and no chicken thighs. Instead there was some hummus and a large rolled up lump of chicken skin. I called the manager who repeatedly said 'What do you want me to do about it' and did not apologize. He did not believe me about the thighs. This place is friggin WEIRD!!"}
{"text":"Nice, clean, spacious - but otherwise no frills. Food is AWESOME and the place has a real mom and pop feel to it. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mideastern food. Got falafel, tabouli, grape leaves and some entrees that were all phenomenal. You should come and eat here right now."}
{"text":"Nice addition to Indian Land/Fort Mill!  We have eaten there several times and have not been disappointed.  The hummus and Baba Ghannouj are awesome.  Rice is well cooked and very flavorful.  We have had several different kinds of meat and they are all tender and flavorful.  Owner is very personable as well!"}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise.... If you're one who doesn't eat meat, their vegetarian options were excellent....  Had the Chicken Shawarma and it was delicious!!!!  They also had a great variety of hummus.  If you're a fan of Greek food, the menu has similarities...."}
{"text":"Been to Jerusalem Cafe several times, now.  Everything we've tried has been delicious.  The lima beans and rice are a family favorite!"}
{"text":"This has got to be the best Falafel in the Queen City!! Service with a smile is always a plus, too. The server even asked to see my ID, since I have CID on the back of my debit card! People hardly ever do that. Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. You can get an inexpensive falafel for lunch that tastes home-made. Everything I've had here has been fantastic. 

Grape leaves are the best I've had. I typically am not a fan of them but I tried them out and loved theirs. 

Their tzatziki sauce is amazing. I get a side of it every time and add it to my falafel it's so good. 

The tabouleh is very fresh and flavorful, with a bit more lemon than I'm used to, which is a good thing and makes the other flavors pop.

And you *** HAVE TO TRY THEIR 'FRIES' ***. They are home made sliced potatoes that they fry up to perfection. So so so good. 

The atmosphere is of a very nice cafe, and they recently made some interior decorating updates that make for a very nice feel. Some other reviewer had given, in my opinion, an unfair 3 star rating based the atmosphere, I'd bet they would like the place much better now, though it never deserved a 3. 

I'd love to see them come up with a lunch special, as getting a falafel and a side is a tad on the pricey side, though worth every penny. 

The family that owns it have been *very* nice to us, they remember us, say hello and smile and wave when we come in and we always chat a bit. I like that. Makes you feel like you're part of a community. 

Highly recommend for a nice lunch or causal dinner.

EDIT: Updated review to reflect new interior decorating upgrades made."}
{"text":"I've grown up with this type of food & vouch to say that this is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"This is the most disgusting excuse for a restaurant ever.  When we entered, we were sure we entered a back door or something, the layout makes you instantly feel like you walked in the wrong door.  No hostess or waitress to be found.  The room is dark and no ambiance/music/nothing. After 10 minutes of waiting and no sign of anyone working in this \"restaurant\" we watched another customer walk out for not being served.  Finally someone holding a chick fil-A cup came out of the back and said \"oh look customers, I should get someone\"  He went and got the waitress then left. The waitress came and brought our drinks,  tea so old and dirty tasting I am sure they never clean their equipment.  She promised to bring a straw out to me, came back cleaned off 2 tables wandered around and I had to ask her to place our order and for that straw.  She said oh let me get my notepad I'll be right back, 5 minutes later she came back to take our order. My husband ordered the falafel wrap with no tomatoes and I ordered the pie plate with salad.  Husbands falafel wrap was laden with tomatoes and my pie plate a disaster.  The bottoms of each pie was soggy and the top corners hard and inedible (like they were microwaved for too long)  The meat and the chicken loosely resembled dog food out of a can and the spinach was definitely pre frozen not fresh.  Even the salad had brown soggy lettuce. When I told the waitress I did not want it and that my husband wanted no tomatoes she begrudgingly took both away.  Brought his back and never offered something different to me. She handed us the check with a $5.00 off credit for my inedible $11.00 plate.  When my husband went and grabbed a menu to see if there was something different I may want the owner came out and said \"I am not cooking anything else we are closing.\"  Mind you it was 6:00 pm on a Monday and they were remaining open.  He was very rude.  The waitress was sloppy, slow and not very nice.  
So if you want a rude, poor customer service establishment who's food resembles microwaved dog food go for it."}
{"text":"Best lamb kabobs I've ever had.  Tender, moist.  Not overcooked.  Hummus and Baba Ghanouj are delicious, though their pitas were a bit dried out.  His is really a hidden gem tucked away on 521.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Had lunch today at 12pm.  As noted in prior reviews, storefront appears quite plain as is the interior decor, but the food...quite impressive.  The Kufta (kofta) pita wrap was delicious and with fried chips and a drink only $8.   My companion had one of the larger kebob entrees that included hummous and tabouleh and said it was very good as well.  Perhaps if they could allow for some al fresco seating, it would bring in more business??"}
{"text":"My husband and I love great ethnic food, and this is one of our regular spots in Charlotte. I love the veggie combo, as their baba ganoush is out of this world and their falafel is the best I've ever had. I used to enjoy making falafel, but I don't bother anymore because they're so good at Jerusalem Cafe. My husband always gets something different, usually a daily special or a recommendation by the owner (who is very nice), and he's always been very happy. Even the kids love it - this year, our five-year-old requested baklava instead of a birthday cake!

If you're with a group and want a real treat, spring for the family-style dinner. I think it's about 15 bucks a person, and they just keep bringing out dish after dish. It's a really great way to try new things, and we absolutely loved all the food. Really impresses guests, too. By the way, they do let you bring in your own wine.

Look for the occasional Groupon for an even better deal."}
{"text":"This place for an Arab middle eastern cuisine and style has it goin on!  Quaint and cozy very clean and the food we had for the first time was awesome!  We def recommend the falafel, chicken shawerma and fries and the lentil soup!  Having been in ME and eaten most all Arab foods we have no doubt the rest of the menu is equally awesome!  We highly recommend as we will be back to try everything.  Prices are reasonable as well six stars!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst restaurant i been to.  My chicken was burnt! The order was put in compleatly wrong and the food was truly tastless. The stuff grape leaves were pretty good.  The rest, i would say go to a better place,  specially with those prices."}
{"text":"Bingo. Now that's what I'm talking about. I walked by and first the name caught my attention \"Jerusalem\" cafe. I figured it was mediterranean so I snuck in and asked for a menu. 

Even though this is in a strip mall, you forget where you are once inside. They nicely decorated the place with knee-wall height stone, and the kitchen has stone/wood arches. The doorway to the back has what looks like antique/rustic hewn wood casings and trim. Very nice touch. When someone spends this much time decorating it usually means they work that hard in the kitchen. I was right.

I ordered the $29 Grilled dinner for two including Kufta (mediterranean style meat loaf that are sausage shaped) lamb and chicken. She gave me three sides. I chose grape leaves, tabouleh and hummus. 

Everything was fresh and authentic. I took it home and my family enjoyed it. Even though it was for \"2\" 4 people with a moderate/light appetite could have been satisfied. 

From the fresh lamb and curried chicken down to the fresh squeezed lemon for tha tabouleh - everything was perfect. Authentic. If you've never had Armenian, Egyptian, Lebanese food (Mediterranean) it is like aromatherapy. Try it. Wonderful. 

We'll Be Back!!!"}
{"text":"This is the middle eastern place chef's go to eat at, well at least this chef. When I am not cooking for others I want good food, fresh , tasty , simple is good. My husband lived int he UAE and loves this type of food and we eat it almost every one of my days off. The Hummus is so good with the schwarma  on top. i love the fresh taste, the baklava is the best and i go just to get my husband a few baklava before I go home. I also love the fact that this is a small family place , often see the wife at Restaurant Depot or the Chef Store. BTW I share a building with a middle eastern place and still go out of my way to eat here, when I could just walk up front."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times with my better half. It's close by. This place is usually kinda of dead but the food is always good. Great hummas! I've had the falafel pita which is tasty. My wife got the shawarma and it has a fantastic flavor. For good food and a different experience, this is the place. It's only getting 3 stars because they don't serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Holy crud was this place AMAZING!!!!!! It came highly recommended, and we happened to get lucky with a groupon. Our server was so nice and great at making suggestions! Our favorite was the foul dip over hummus (not even on the menu). We came home with a ton of food. My boyfriend, who didn't like hummus before he went there, wanted to bathe in the Jerusalem salad is was so good!! We cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss!!! Ordered takeout - they forgot to pack the salad that comes with the veggie plate. The potato fries were dry and oily - not good at all."}
{"text":"We went yesterday and not impressed. The ice machine was out of ice. I asked the cashier to refill but that went to deaf ears. I filled glass with the marked can sweat tea but it was unsweetened. The people that wrote previous reviews must be from mid west corn fields because the food wasn't all that. We had veggie combo. We had gyro plates . The tables were filthy and the service kid tried to be nice. I would not recommend nor go back to this place.  We had plenty of other mediterranean food that by far supersedes this place. Sorry"}
{"text":"Best in Charlotte!

We love this place. Intimate setting and great staff. We recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  The shawarma is fantastic and the ooze rice is great.  The owner also does a great job recommending additional specials like braised lamb that are terrific."}
{"text":"Nice place, very clean and open but a little dark they could use a tad better lighting (but we were there on a rainy day) so maybe that contributed to it. The food was good we had the hummus with the warm pita bread as an appetizer and I had the lentil soup and my husband had the lamb kabob wrap with fries. We both enjoyed our food but I did need to add sea salt to everything. Will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Went with my family Saturday evening, very early around 5:30 for dinner.  The setup is very strange as there is no one there to greet you upon entering and we weren't sure if we were to stand and wait or just grab a table, so we opted to grab a table.  Shortly after sitting, we were greeted and brought menus.  The menu is a diverse selection if Middle Eastern food.  The server gave us the recommendation of Shawerma with rice or hummus, I chose the hummus.  My husband ordered the Gyro plate and we ordered Falafel to start. The food was fantastic! Everything was packed full of flavor.  The service was prompt and very friendly.  By the time we left, the restaurant was packed, a very popular place.  I will return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"My wife, 16 month old son, and I had lunch there today and it was great! We shared a hummus plate and chicken shawarma and there was food leftover. Food was authentic a delicious. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Diamond in the rough!  This great little mediterranean style restaurant is nuzzled into the strip mall next to the Harris Teeter and Rite Aid.  Decked out in everything Jerusalem, the decor is stylish, and appropriate for what they are and are trying to be.

You can smell (and see) the roasting chickens, which immediately helps get your appetite going.  The falafel is really good, I would definitely recommend giving it a whirl.

We need to get the word out on this gem - it's a great spot for a delicious meal anytime!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food. I had the lamb and my fiancé had the shawarma entrees and both were tasty! The lentil soup was really good too."}
{"text":"Not at all what I expected. I'm new to the area so I surfed Groupon for some local deals and found this place. I love gyros and was really in the mood for one. I decided to go for the platter with fries which ended up being greasy sliced potatoes. (13$) Definitely wouldn't pay that for what I received. The meat was under seasoned and left a lot to be desired. I'm used to a thick fluffy pita and understand that these things may vary especially since this place is authentic but I would opt for a fat fluffy pita vs a thin pita cut into pieces. The falafel was delicious and the cook was super cute and accommodating, the food just missed the mark and isn't enough to make me want to go back."}
