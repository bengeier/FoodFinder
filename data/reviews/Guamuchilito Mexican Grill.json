{"text":"One of the best tacos I ever ate in USA ( and I ate them on million different places thru entire country ). Clean restaurant , great place ( i would give them 10 stars )"}
{"text":"As a super picky person, tried the posole & it was delicious. Very clean facility. The workers were super friendly & easy going as well."}
{"text":"Menu not in English, waitress did not speak English. Burrito was way overpriced for the size and was very plain (carne asada, rice, beans) .I love going to local family owned Mexican places but I will not be going here"}
{"text":"This place is all around awesome.  It's a family run business and you can tell that they care deeply about their customers and  food.  The food was fresh, hand made and delicious.  The service was by far the best we've received in a long time.  We highly recommend it and bet you'll go back!"}
{"text":"What a great find!  Area seems a bit questionable but we needed a place to eat, this place had good reviews so we tried it. WOW!!  Loved it. Fresh tortillas, fresh food, we will definitely be back!!  Thanks for taking such good care of us close to closing time!!!"}
{"text":"New spot from what I know! I love my Mexican food so definitely had to try it out. Good authentic food! We came in a fairly large party, all starving so we weren't shy. My family of 3 ordered 3 chicken \"Gorditas\" in my world they are sopes, papas con carneasada, bean burrito and a very big burrito. The rest of the table had three orders of enchiladas, a quesadilla, and another papas con carne. The gorditas were a bit fancy lol, the actual sope was thin and a bit harder than normal. The veggies however were delicious and I especially loved that they brought our warm caldo to smother on top. Try that if you haven't! The papas con carne were amazing and filling as ever. Everyone loved the enchiladas except my friend who wanted an over easy egg on top and then the food was delivered, no egg. It was ok though. The one complaint and reason for rating was the wait time, since they are new we expected it but it was difficult with two babies and starving! All in all give it a shot the flavors are good and authentic!"}
{"text":"Definite five stars. Cannot wait to return! We had the shredded beef chimichanga and the posole. The chimichanga was so beautifully presented and delicious and the pozole was rich and flavorful, probably the best I've ever had. The service was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying this place and I can only say it's the real deal authentic Mexican taste you want with that home made feel..definitely a hidden gem and will be coming back give it a try you won't be dissapointed"}
{"text":"Me encanta este lugar, tienen \"Autentica\" comida mexicana, no solo arroz y frijoles como en la mayoria de los lugares!!!   Y si pides solo tacos, preparate a probar los mejores, con tortillas de maiz hechas a mano y al instante!!!"}
