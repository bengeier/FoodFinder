{"text":"My boyfriend and I were walking through Paris and decided we wanted something quick to eat to hold us over until our dinner reservation. We walked by La Pizza and saw their sign for the 2 slice and soda combo for $10.00. 

The presliced pizzas looked good while we were waiting in line. I got margherita and my boyfriend got pepperoni. Mine was delicious. I loved the dough and cheese. My boyfriend's pepperoni was a little on the greasy side but what do you expect with pepperoni? He said it was really good and the pepperonis had a spicey kick.

I was eyeing their desserts but decided not to go for it. But now that I look back, I really wish we made a second stop in there for dessert before we left Vegas.

When I come back to Vegas, I will certainly make a pit stop at La Pizza again."}
{"text":"Been there a few times now on two trips.  

First trip the pizza was hard at the end, but it was near 2am, and I dont think they were making anymore 

This trip we went 2x , first time was great and selection was good, 

second time it was the weekend, and there is an inside and outside order station, since we had a group we went inside.  There were 4 pizzas while in line, staring right at us, but one person was working the outside station and was quick as hell, there were two workers inside who were helping at the register, they took your order there.  We stand in line for 20 minutes and get to the register, we ask for pizza and she says is there any there???  I said there was while we were standing there, maybe one of you should help with pizza while the other does the register, she says if you want it faster maybe go outside and order it.  I then try to explain that if there is none inside for us, there is none outside for us right, she says maybe next time.  

I deduct a star for this but only one, I like their pizza, it's cheaper than sabbaro and taste better.  2 slices and a soda for 10.80!!!!

D"}
{"text":"Greasy but very good pizza, the way it's meant to be. Perfect fast food, great after walking around on the strip drunk all day. They could be faster making the food."}
{"text":"Wow this pizza was so delicious!!!!!! I wanted more after my boyfriend and I finished the entire box by ourselves!  You must try it if you're in vegas"}
{"text":"La Pizza is located inside Paris Las Vegas hotel. We stopped by on our way because there was such a long line for their pizza and we just wanted to see what the hype was about. I am an avid pizza lover and will never say no to pizza!

It was later at night so they were low on the types of pizza, but it seemed as if the mushroom pizza was the most popular so we decided on that. They had a deal of: 2 pizza and a drink for $10 (or something to that sort). We didn't pass up on that offer! 

We ind of had high hopes after seeing the long line and high rating, but I wasn't too impressed. I think that I would come back if I was in the hotel already, but would not really go out of my way to get it."}
{"text":"Checked in late and wanted something quick to eat.  Got the mushroom pizza and a salad.  Well, that woke me up!  The best mushroom pizza I've ever had.  I've been craving it ever since.  The crust was thin, but not too.  Lots of cheese and even more mushrooms.  The salad was very big and had a very nice dressing.  The only bad thing is that I've been trying a lot of mushroom pizza here at home and can't find a match."}
{"text":"My family was in town, staying at Paris so we were craving a late night snack after drinking all day. I had a slice of the supreme which was extremely too greasy and almost impossible to eat because it just fell apart when I picked it up. The place is kinda dirty too.. Felt like I needed to bathe after being there :/"}
{"text":"2 slices of pizza and soda for $9.99. Or swap the soda for a beer for $10.99. It was a nice place to grab something to scarf down quick as I strolled through Paris to see the sights.

Nothing particularly special about the pizza- it's actually on the greasier side (the grease will definitely help if you're going to do some major drinking later on in the night).

Cute little tables you can sit at to enjoy your food as you watch the passersby. 

The only major con was that there was only one lady and one little counter. She was trying to take multiple orders simultaneously, but I'm not sure that really helped her save any time."}
{"text":"Hits the spot late at night (or if you're a wimp like me... early at night). My only complaint was that they were out of the margarita pizza... the cheese and pepperoni were grubbin' though!"}
{"text":"I've had plenty of New York-style pizza and this is some of the best ever. La Pizza is inside The Paris on the strip and blew my mind.  My wife and I shared a full-sized pizza (combination) and gobbled it up in one sitting. We ate some quality pizza in Manhattan last summer but THIS place was better than most. It'll be our first stop when we're in Vegas next."}
{"text":"Slow service, they told us our pizza would be ready in 15 mins so after 20 mins we went to see why it's taking so long and they told us it's 40 mins not 15 because they we're having issues with the oven. But overall the pizza is really yummy. We got the wild mushroom pizza and the margarita. I highly recommend the wild mushroom pizza The margarita wasn't bad either but definitely not as good."}
{"text":"The best place to come when you need to sober up and have a late night bite. Pizzas are great and there open very late. They also have a variety of desserts and deli style sandwiches and salads"}
{"text":"La Pizza is a good option for late night bites and getting a quick fix of pizza when staying at Paris. They have a deal which is 2 slices of Pizza for $9.99 with a fountain. The only thing to beware of is that the pizza selection although there is a wide variety, it is very limited late night minus a star for that because they were out of the one I wanted to try. There is ample seating along this pizza joint out front and plenty of seating inside as well. The ambiance is nice with the Paris feel and decor along the path of other restaurants nearby when seated along that path or even from the inside dining area. Service is just okay.. it's just like your average quick pizza joint nothing fancy and straight to the point.. tasty pizza! ;P"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late night grab to eat. They barely had any ready-made pizzas. Had to get something that was available, pizza was okay... Service was horrible! The girl at the register was not allowing us to take more than one napkin. Granted this is a huge pizza bigger than the size of my face how do you expect me to eat it normally using one napkin? She was very rude and argued constantly until I returned the additional napkin that I had taken... Is that even sanitary?"}
{"text":"i would stay at this hotel again just for the pizza. huge slices and sooooo good! the price wasnt bad considering how much you got. the bakery inside was pretty amazing as well. we stayed at the paris on our honeymoon and came back just for the pizza and a fruit tart."}
{"text":"Very convenient to grab a slice for a quick meal or late night snack. We arrived in Vegas late, it was midnight East Coast time and we were starving!!! We ordered a bunch of slices from Le Pizza and basically inhaled them. Having a quick pizza counter right downstairs was super convenient so we didn't have to walk around to find food or order overpriced room service."}
{"text":"Ended up here with the kiddies after realizing that we did *not* want to wait in line for the buffet at Paris.  We ordered a whole pizza, half cheese, half pepperoni (if you have kids you'll get it).  It was decent, although I like the pizza at my local joint better; plus it was a bit pricey ($40+ for a pizza and four drinks, although this *is* Vegas).  Older son thought the crust was too chewy, but I didn't mind. An okay choice if you need some grub in a pinch."}
{"text":"Solid slice for a good price (relatively). A slice is $4.50, or 2 slices and a soda for $10. The crust was crisp and not too thick, and the slice itself was well sauced and topped. Good for a meal in between buffets"}
{"text":"I would be way more satisfied eating a Hot Pocket.  This little pizza window inside the Paris hotel was open late so I decided to grab a slice since I was starving.  I ordered one combo slice but was served two giant slices.  Normally, this would have made me really happy, but the pizza was super greasy and salty.   I can't complain about the price since it was only a little over $5 dollars after tax but I would definitely have to be drunk to eat here."}
{"text":"This lil pizza window spot saved me!!! 1 huge slice for $5...it was worth it. It is pretty greasy. .. But it's the perfect snack when you're hungry and drunk in the vegas heat!!!"}
{"text":"NY style thats better than the pizza in NYNY casino. Weird but a definite try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious but way overpriced. It is extremely greasy so you might want to pat it down with a napkin before eating."}
{"text":"Late night snack...a slice is a little less than $6...lol...more than a whole pizza from Little Ceasars...got a slice of pepperoni and it was okay."}
{"text":"Late night dinner called for a quick pizza fix. You can get 2 decently sized slices of pizza and a drink for $10.

I got a margherita slice(my favorite) and a cheese slice. And my husband went for the mushroom and a combo pizza. It all tasted very good and fresh.

Service was fast and plenty of seating nearby."}
{"text":"If you like Costco pizza (who doesn't?) you will LOVE their pizza here . They also have a lot of really good pastries that are picture worthy! My fave is their clam chowder bread bowl! Really good price too considering it's on the strip."}
{"text":"ehh decent pizza, ONLY if you are 

1) staying at Ballys Hotel 
2) are drunk
3) can't find another slice of pizza"}
{"text":"Got into Vegas late Monday night and we were looking for something to eat but not anything too involved. We were staying at Paris so we were wondering around getting acquainted with the hotel and we walked by La Pizza. I had been craving pizza for about a week so decided that's what we were going to get. I about died and went to heaven when I bit into my 3 cheese slice! I'm an East Coast gal who's been living in CA for 30 years. I really miss my east coast pizza and this pizza brought me home. It was so gooey and cheesy and thin. We both got another slice with a root beer after devouring the first slice. Try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I stayed at Ballys last night and saw this place walking though earlier in the day. I figured I would get a few slices of pizza for dinner. I walked up to the little window and the lady tells me they don't have any plain pizza, just one slice of pepperoni. This was at 7 p.m. on a Sunday night. What kind of pizza place doesn't have plain pizza at 7 p.m?? The lady was relatively nice though."}
{"text":"La Pizza, or also known as JJ's Pizza Window, is located inside the Paris Hotel & Casino. It is connected to JJ's Boulangerie. I was waiting for hubby to get finished at a store and decided to try a slice of pizza from here. You order from the walk-up window and they sell pizza by the slice. The cashier was very friendly and told me that fresh pizza was just coming out of the oven. She also said they use san marzano tomatoes in their pizza sauce. I just ordered a simple slice of \"Cheese Pizza\" priced at $4 before tax. It was a decent size slice. Next to the walk-up window there is a small seating area with about 4 tables that have 2 chairs at each table. The pizza slice was pretty good. I did have to dab some grease off of the top with a napkin, but that was just my preference, it wasn't too overly greasy. The crust was crisp and the pizza was nice and hot. I think next time I will get a slice with toppings and see how that is. I also will ask for a side of sauce since I didn't taste too much of it on the pizza and I usually enjoy dipping my pizza in sauce anyway. I know in the picture I posted it looks like there was a decent amount of sauce, but I really couldn't taste it. The pizza slice is 3.5 stars for me. I give a full 4 stars total because the pizza was edible and didn't taste bad (it just didn't *wow* me), the cashier was friendly and I enjoyed sitting at one of their outside tables by myself having a quick slice and tourist-watching. 

The daily special (probably everyday) is 1 slice of pizza, chips and a drink for $6.99, but I had a drink already so just the slice would do for me today. If you are passing through this is a nice place to grab a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Have gone here quite a few times and I am satisfied each time. Pepperoni, margherita and the cheese pizza were my family's fave. I love the fact that they open late! I've gone there for their breakfast too. Ham, cheese, and egg croissant were good too but quite overpriced at $11/each - but then again, everything is overpriced in the strip. 
Coconut and cookies and cream ice cream are definitely worth trying! 
Will definitely keep coming back here!"}
{"text":"I decided to visit La Pizza after 4 days of staying at Paris and walking by it every time I walked out of the hotel.  I dropped there by during my last night right before they closed.

I opted for their special combo which was 2 slices of pizza and a soda for $9.99.  It's a really good deal considering that their slices are huuuge!!  I picked up a Margherita slice and a slice of their Wild Mushroom pizza (http://bit.ly/1shKE7T).  Both were really good!

The spot is conjoined to JJ's Boulangerie and is open from 11am-2am so it's definitely a spot to consider for those late night munchies on the Strip."}
{"text":"Very good pizza! We got two slices and a fountain drink for $9.99! Where other places were like $5+ each slice. I had the combination and meat and both were good!"}
{"text":"Greasy and overpriced."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a quick bite to eat or take something to go.  Their special is always a favorite that comprises of two slices of any pizza and a fountain drink for $9.99...pretty stellar deal considering we're talking about a Las Vegas casino eatery.  Make sure to have ample time in your hands if you order a whole pizza (10-20) since it is made to order.  I recommend their artichoke and margherita pizzas...they've never failed me unlike the pepperoni and mushroom pizzas.

Horrible thing about La Pizza though is that if Le Village Buffet's buffet line is long you're most probably gonna be bombarded with passerbys saying \"excuse me\" to you or rudely nudging you a bit, constantly, as you line up to make your order.  Good place to go when everything seems busy at the Paris Hotel & Casino."}
{"text":"Cheap pizza that tastes cheap. Had a slice of pizza and it was mediocre. Crust was overdone and I wasn't that thrilled but I would say it's a bargain still at $5 a slice."}
{"text":"You know, this may not be a fair review. I'm comparing this to Boston's Pizza. It doesn't even compare. I had a meat slice and a pepperoni slice. These are New York style pizzas. The crust was still crispy, but the kicker was that there was a ton of taste in each bite. The pepperoni had a strong meaty taste and the Mozzarella had tons of taste in itself. If you're in Paris, check this place out!"}
{"text":"After a night of drinking, it's hard to not pass La Pizza and smell the deliciousness of fresh pizza. There's about 6 different kinds, and although they look appealing, the pizza is just okay. Extra greasy and salty. The staff working there are not that friendly either. For about $5 a slice, the pizza is just okay. They do sell their fresh breads at half price late at night, but they're a bit dry."}
{"text":"I'm not a pizza person. But I must say I always stop and eat the pizza here. The best pizza ever! Amazing"}
{"text":"Quick and cheap pizza at Paris Hotel & Casino.

We just needed a quick bite and there wasn't a line as we were passing by, so we decided to stop in.  They had a pizza deal for 2 slices and a soda for $9.99.  Perfect to share with someone."}
{"text":"I know Paris has a lot of options in terms of dining and eateries, BUT La Pizza is my favorite go to spot in Paris. They place itself doesn't offer much room for diners - small tables and often occupied, but still that doesn't bother me. I don't mind being a vulture to grab a free table, which in my recent experience, took 20 mins.  But long waits are full tables means the food is good!   A pizza place it may be, but that's not how I view it. What comes to mind is food court - but not in a bad way,  La Pizza has so many things to offer - breads, pastries, sandwiches, pizza, dessert, etc, etc, etc. so yeah, a food court, right?

Don't ask me why I came to Paris Hotel two times in one week for that Smoked Salmon sandwich?!? And why did I buy a sandwich at a pizza place?  ok, i'll tell you - I think it's because it's yummy and so simple, and something I could not have made for myself.  And maybe it's because it's next door to the crepe place so I can eat the sandwich, while friends ate the crepe and some pizza....and pastries.  and it's also because the bread reminds me of the bread I had in Europe - soft, and soft and soft....I like soft bread."}
{"text":"You can smell this place coming down the escalator which immediately gets the appetite going. This is a must for my girlfriend and I every time we are in Vegas. Best Pizza in Vegas!! Good prices and better quality!!"}
{"text":"Great quick in and out pizza but seating is hard first come first serve.  Pizza by the slice is convenient too."}
{"text":"Looking for something small for a late night snack.

Although service was fine and quick the pizza was greasy and way to salty."}
{"text":"We thought to try the buffet on the opposite side but the Q was way too long. Looked like it would take an hour to actually enter the buffet. So we looked around and found this place. Plus we were looking for vegetarian options. We ordered 2 Margarita pizza- cheese, basil and tomatoes. Fresh and Yummy they were! And then 2 Tiramisu cake in a chocolate cup! Sweet and yummy! But too heavy! One would do for 2! The chocolate cup was too much to eat up! We also had a croissant. It was good. They had large slices of pizzas to choose from. You could order an entire pizza too. It would take 10-15 mins. But that would be really large. They have a wide variety of bread and croissants. Also they have a colorful, presentable and mouthwatering collection of desserts- cakes and pies with chocolate and fruits, so beautifully arranged. It's a hard to choose list of desserts."}
{"text":"Decent and cheap. The two slice and soda combo is only $10. Their marghrita pizza is pretty good. The combo slice was pathetic. Only 1 1/2 pieces of pepperoni and a few pieces of other toppings. Kinda soggy, but the crust was good."}
{"text":"We ordered two slices of pepperoni and combination for breakfast! I love that it's conveniently located. The prices were reasonable! I usually don't eat crusts, but the crust here was well-made and very fluffy!"}
{"text":"Deep in the outskirts of Paris near the suburb of Bally's, off the cobblestone street leading from the vicinity of the Eiffel Tower, there is a business serving pizza out of a window called La Pizza. A couple times in Paris, I have paused along the cobblestone street to chow down some La Pizza. 

    It is not the Eiffel Tower that attracts me to Paris at nighttime. It is the Billy Krauss rock n' roll show at the nearby Napoleon's Dueling Piano Lounge that leads me to Paris. The other night, I needed an inexpensive and quick meal before showtime started at 9 o' clock. The $9.99 two slices of pizza with a small fountain drink would do the trick, just like it did a few years ago before seeing Bill and Dave perform. 

   La Pizza shares a crowded cobblestone street with a few popular Parisan eateries: the crepe shop, the Paris Buffet, and J.J.'s Boulangerie. The upshot is that when I stand by La Pizza, crowds of people surround me. Then when I bring my pizza inside J.J's Boulangerie it is a challenge finding a table. La Pizza is the glorified pizza counter of J.J's Boulangerie. The window counter feeds their customers into the crowded J.J's Boulangerie creating a stress on finding a table. 

   La Pizza is La decent. In my opinion La Pizza is better than Sam's Club and far below New York pizza. Truthfully I appreciate Papa John's and Little Caesar's more. Disparate from other pizza places La Pizza has a special ingredient: the Paris motif. The Parisan environment is the topping on the pizza that creates a unique dining experience. It is amazing how much a well done theme improves the experience. If I were eating this ordinary pizza in a no frills brick & mortar shopping mall pizza joint or in a mall food court, I'd be like, \"I spent $9 for a meal that is $2.50 at Sam's Club? \" However in this Disneyfied Paris, the theme envelopes my mind with all this Paris stimuli. Biting into this unremarkable I feel like I am biting into this remarkable Paris scene. Surrounding me are the Parisan pastries of J.J's Boulangerie. My mind is so occupied with people watching, the details of Paris, and the up and coming show that I am not annoyed that the beverage is so small. Or I am not annoyed that they never gave me a napkin and I'd have to walk back to the crowded pizza window. The theme and upbeat atmosphere takes me away from thinking that for a couple of dollars more that I could of ordered a personal pie and bottomless beverage at Grimaldi's. 

   La Pizza is a decent meal that could turn to extraordinary with a raspberry napoleon from J.J's Boulangerie. Their raspberry napoleon is drop dead 5 star out of this world delicious that will elevate your taste buds higher than the Eiffel Tower. If you are in Paris and are decided on La Pizza, I suggest leaving room for dessert."}
{"text":"Not a fan.  The Scotsman and I stopped in here for a late lunch one afternoon that we were in Vegas. We got their special which was 2 slices and a drink.. 

Sadly those two slices were dripping grease and virtually tasteless.  

The seating is compact, as in, not enough for the amount of folks that show up to eat here, even with the outter court offered, it is quite often overflowing.  I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"We arrived at the Paris late and were pleased that this pizza joint stays open late because we were starving! We ordered a large pepperoni pizza and took it to our room to relax in front of the tv. The taste was fairly good and the slices were big but I couldn't get past the fact that the grease was seeping completely through the crust and dripping onto the plate! Now, I am all about cheesy, greasy pizza but the pizza at La Pizza is difficult to stomach!"}
{"text":"I work at the Paris, so I eat here a few times a week.  I have to say, for a quick slice or two this is my favorite place on the strip.  The service is fast, the ladies working the counter are always friendly, and their pizza is a really good.  I usually grab the pepperoni, but on special occasions they offer meat slices (pepperoni, meatball, sometimes sausage or ham).  The meat slices are my absolute favorite, and on the right day they come with the perfect amount of spice too.  

The special is $10.81 for two slices and a refillable fountain drink, which really isn't bad considering the location.  On top of that, Paris employees receive 20% off.  It's really hard to beat this place considering where we are, and to be honest; probably nothing on the strip does."}
{"text":"This place is open late. Unfortunately I was not able to get the margarita pizza as they were all out. I decided to go for the three cheese instead and they were nice enough to put basil on it for me. The only thing this place is missing is Italian ice."}
{"text":"Was here February 25, 2012. Needed a quick bite before a poker tournament. Surprisingly this pizza was really good."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying this pizza was simply a 7 year memory till we met again. Omg it's exactly how I remembered it, of course fiancé and I took it down with a nice cold Modelo. If your a mushroom lover I highly I recommend their mushroom pizza it's superb, you won't regret it. As for my fiancé she truly enjoyed her Margarita pizza slice. The prices are reasonable about 7 dollars a slice without a drink, I believe it was an additional 2 dollars to add a drink. The service was quick and the dim and relaxing atmosphere and seating inside the pizzeria made it so much more"}
{"text":"Ok really, I can make better pizza than this. Its over priced which is no surprise since it's in a casino on he strip. The pizza crust is decent but the sauce lacked flavor and I thought the cheese was not very good in  quality, you can tell when you bite into it. Its also greasy. You want pizza youll do better at one of the many pizza places outside the strip. 2 slices, 1 soda and 1 beer $20.

The price for a whole pizza is like $25"}
{"text":"The Paris seems to be going into a downward spiral. The quality of the buffet has declined to a new low.  They increased the prices at the crepe place so that all crepes are now $10 each. And it looks as if they are trying to recreate the stereotypical French attitude since they are extremely rude to the customers at La Pizza.

I went in one late night last week for a slice of pizza. The lady at the register was a real pill. After I got my $4.50 slice of mushroom pizza, I took a bite and immediately spit it out since the bottom was completely burned, I mean the tip of the crust was the color of charcoal. 

I brought my piece back for a replacement.  The lady went over and looked at the bottoms of all pizzas and brought back a piece of slightly less burned cheese pizza.  The problems with this scenario are (1) I didn't want plain cheese pizza, and (2) cheese pizza costs $.50 less and I couldn't get a refund for the difference.

To add insult to injury, there are no free cups of tap water for paying customers. They charged me $1.00 for tap water on a day when the temperature reached over 110 degrees. It is absolutely ludicrous to charge for a cup of tap water, but you would at least expect them to waive the $1 fee on hot days since you can actually die of dehydration and it is quite easy to become dehydrate in Vegas in late July.

The pizza itself was okay. Aside from the burned crust, it was a tad too salty and needed to be blotted twice since it was so greasy. I guess I am lucky they don't charge for napkins too."}
{"text":"Enjoy stopping through here for a quick bite. Pizza slices are smaller than some joints, but the flavor is poppin'. Service is fairly quick, but not as welcoming as some places. They do get pretty busy since it's a high traffic area with tourists gazing at everything, but worth the try if you're looking for a pizza kick. 
You may order indoors or outside their window. Pastries boxes are usually half off after 3pm, and make for a great gift or late night snack to keep in your room."}
{"text":"Wanted a late night snack (midnight) and perfect spot.

Located in the Paris Casino walkway towards Ballys, across from the buffet. 

They had a special : 

2 slices of pizza + drink $9.99

2 slices of pizza + beer $14.99

Pizza is thin crust. We ordered the Meat Pizza to share.

They had different varieties of slices:

Pepperoni
Meat
Wild Mushroom
Three Cheese
Vegetarian
Margarita

You can order from their window. I would definitely stop by again for a slice."}
{"text":"It's 11:50 pm and we are getting the midnight munchies. Thank god for Vegas- a city that rarely sleeps. I've walked by this place everyday since we were staying at Paris and finally I decided to give it a try since it was still open and it was literally a minute walk from our room.

FOOD: I got their two slices with a drink combo for $10 and in Vegas, that's fairly cheap. Ordered two of their pepperoni pizzas with an orange soda named 'Twister'. The slices were HUGE and loved the fact that they were that big, definitely worth my money. BUT, once I got it up to our room and started eating it, it was SUPER greasy. Beyond what I've ever eaten back home at Pizza Huts and Domino's pizzas. Made me feel so lethargic after I finished it. D: Then again, the flavor and the size of the pepperonis were at least pretty decent. The breading was really thin and the crust wasn't too appealing because it got kind of hard at the end. Also, our drink didn't have any syrup in it- it was like dry carbonation liquid (you get that bitter soda taste because it doesn't have any sugar in it). Yeah, that was a bummer. :-/

Overall: A decent place with good prices if you want a late night meal!"}
{"text":"I showed up around midnight and all pizza were sold out, but the chef told me he is making more pizzas and it will be ready 20 min. I waited for 15 min, I told the cashier ( her name is Sarah) I want one slice mushroom pizza and one combo pizza. She said no more combo pizza to me! I said \" could you please check with the chef?\" She said \"no, No more tonight only pepperoni pizza! \" ( but I saw the chef was making mushroom pizza!) so I left La Pizza without pizza. Five min later I went back and found a whole mushrooms pizza sitting there.  I was furious, She wouldn't even bother check with the chef and her attitudes and the chef attitude was very bad. I confronted her and she said she only worked there she couldn't care less! I love to stay at Paris hotel but after this incident, I am not coming back again! There are plenty of casinos I can choose. management better take notice! I will tell all my friends about my bad experience and recommend my friends to stay Cesar palace. It's hard to find good help, Las Vegas is a tourist place, Paris hotel probably don't care good customer service!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about the pizza here. If you are looking for something quick and easy you can generally grab a slice of pizza here without too much of a wait. However, it is literally just a window serving whole pizzas or by the slice so sometimes the line gets a little long due to its prime location in between Bally's and Paris."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, I guess I did eat here.  I guess that's what Yelp is for, to remember what you did when you were on vacation in Vegas.  The pizza was great, but maybe that's because it was 3am?  I don't know.  Careful, because it's hot and I think I burned the roof of my mouth and was hurting the next day :("}
{"text":"3.5 stars. My go-to pizza spot if i want something quick in Vegas at this moment. The pizza is always delicious for some reason. 

It's a little booth at the dining area in Paris. We passed by this several times on our way to our Bally's room and it's great for a quick snack/meal. I ate this while playing slots and it was divine. $4.50 for a slice of combo, its bigger and taste way better than Costco pizza. It's super oily and greasy, thin crusted, but I think that's what makes it so delicious.  I ate here twice for dinner during our Vegas trip and I must say, it saved us from starving. We had no time to walk to McDonalds nor eat at a sit in restaurant, so this saved us time and energy, as well as money.

LA PIZZA! While passing by it my friends and I always say it in a French accent, then Italian, then Spanish. Good times."}
{"text":"The Margherita pizza was more like cheese pizza. Not as many tomatoes on it as some of the pictures people posted. The raspberry napoleon was not sweet and a little dried out. The procuitto sandwich came on extremely dry and hard bread that cuts the roof of your mouth. Very little balsamic sauce. Overall not satisfying."}
{"text":"It says something when a French themed casinos best food option is \"Authentic Italian pizza.\"  Located inside Paris is a small walk in pizzeria with counter or you can order at the side window.  The food is mostly greasy and tasteless, fit for a late night or early dining option.  Overall the pizza could be a lot better, the ingredients seemed off and even though it was heated in the oven, my food was still on the cold side.  Unless it's really late at night, there are better options elsewhere."}
{"text":"A surprising little place! My boyfriend and I were extremely hung over after a night in the town and wanted something greasy. This HIT THE SPOT!

It's quick, cheap, and easy. Something that you don't come across very often in Las Vegas. The place is set up cafeteria style, so we got our food in minutes. Screw paying for a $20 single meal - go to La Pizza for a fantastic lunch and save the money for a big dinner! 

The quality of the pizza was delicious. The cheese and dough were to die for. I was a little surprised at how greasy the pizzas were, but it worked perfectly for us...for the you know, hang over. 

We will definitely stop by again on our next trip and take advantage of the two pizzas and soda for $9.99!"}
{"text":"Ordered the mushroom pizza here. I was drunk and it was delicious. It also had squid on it. The following morning, I ordered a 3 cheese slice. It was pretty good, I mean how good could a cheese pizza get. The mushroom pizza was perfect though, and the squid was a unique touch that gave the pizza a perfect amount of saltiness and extra texture. I'd try it. 

This place is also open late (not sure of hours)."}
