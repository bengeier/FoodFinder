{"text":"Never noticed this small place in the 15 years I have lived in this neighborhood, but I am glad I have. Breakfast is good and at a better price. Enjoy."}
{"text":"So good and so cheap! Awesome service too! The waitress we had was so sweet and never left us with an empty cup.  I have only went for the breakfast but I will be returning for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"What a dump. I don't know if was the dirty tabletops, the one waitress constantly coming out of the kitchen eating with her mouth open or the other who passed every dish from the corner of the table rather than actually serve the meal. Maybe it was the overcooked bacon or the undercooked potatoes. I should have walked out, you know first impressions and all that."}
{"text":"A great family restaurant atmosphere and good, everyday food.  Not much gourmet in a great diner like this, but there is clearly a personal touch.   An eclectic, blended community crowd of local, hard-working folk gather who are obvious, regular customers.  Eat here for the value in simple, homemade food, attentive service, and friendly smiles by the staff. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We went to Chris' on a cold spring morning, after my fiance and his friends had finished a 5 mile race. Needless to say, we were all quite hungry... they from expending tons of energy running, me for no good reason besides that I love food. 

Inside was quite packed (yay for them!) but soon, with the help of a very experienced waitress who bustled off a lingering party, we sat and contemplated what goods to order. Having bothered the waitress for a bit (me primarily), we got: veggie omelet, the gutbuster omelet, biscuits and gravy, spaghetti and meatballs, and prime rib. All were incredibly reasonably priced, and ranged from ok to delicious. 

Chris' ranks a strong 4 star for me."}
{"text":"Had some work done on my car at Kia of Bedford- great little find- I love diners like this, hot food cooked like I make it at home! The servers were friendly you really can't complain about the prices or portions- definitely a good local spot especially if your walking around here!"}
{"text":"Waitress was top notch and attentive.  Food was priced amazingly.  Loved the shampoo and random household items for sale too."}
{"text":"The restaurant loser of the year award goes to.............. (opening envelope) Chris' Family Restaurant.  I was sat in a lowly table against the bathroom wall. A loud and obnoxious waitress kneeled next to my table the entire time holding onto my guests chair while she had a conversation with the group next to me about who slept with who and what barn they poked around in. I'm not kidding. My personal space was completely invaded and violated. See photo. Place is gross in a trucker kinda way and a tad dirty. Food is average to subpar. Breakfasts are like 3 bucks and heres why: Eggs were overcooked. Toast half slathered in butter and half dry as cardboard. Carpet was filthy. Plates had seen their better days. Place needs to be washed down badly. Not recommended and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Prices are incredibly cheap.  Food is great.  They had all kinds of lenten fish specials on Friday.  I will definitely come back again soon."}
{"text":"all the selections are great and reasonably priced...don't forget to try the daily soup....you can even buy a quart container 'to go' for those chilly days"}
{"text":"I have lived in Bedford for almost 7 years and never ate here.  I am now sorry that it has taken so long to eat here. The food was great and my wife and I were able to eat good sized portions for $11 total. We HIGHLY recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is local. Great breakfast food! You get more than you are paying for. All of the staff there are friendly! Best breakfast place in Ohio! Haven't tried their dinner yet, but plan into. Go check them out, you won't regret it! My go to breakfast is : eggs, bacon, and French toast special. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Family of 3 from New York came again, awesome, the 2nd time around  still on our vacation.  Must check it out if your in town. Love it."}
{"text":"Great prices but my food was not seasoned and seemed to have been sitting for awhile. Also, pasteurized cheese is the worse and this is what they use."}
{"text":"What a lovely little place. Although from the outside you might feel slightly hesitant, don't be scared - walk on through those doors. What you will find on the other side is an angelic little spot with fast service and great comfort food. 

I read previous posts about the atmosphere and clientele (particularly those that look like they eat well, if you know what I'm sayin) and thought to myself, 'I must try that place!' And boy am I glad that I did. A previous reviewer also mentioned that service was pretty much all business and I would agree. I wouldn't say our server seemed to adore our company, but she still checked on us a few times and made sure we had what we needed. I got the Western omelette and it was a hit. Pancakes were average, but the food was cheap. I wouldn't expect wonders from this place (no duck confit anytime soon, and I probably wouldn't hit up the seafood) but it was perfect for a bite to eat and a nice brunch."}
{"text":"There should be way more reviews for this unless the locals purposely don't want you to know it is here bc it can get packed inside. I worked by here and have ate their food at least 30 times. 

That said the lunch menu is ok as well as dinner but breakfast is where they nail it.

Have not had one bad breakfast from them ever for the price. I may be a little biased as it is family run and everyone there was always very nice. As far as the speed the food is ready, insanely quick. We often put in 30-50 dollar orders and would have it in 15 minutes or less nearly every time even when they were extremely busy."}
{"text":"The food is just ok, but if you're killing time while getting an oil change, it's handy to walk to. Be warned though that the service is rude and they place no value on single customers. They will refuse to sit you in a booth even if there are plenty open and no other parties are waiting to be seated. It's tacky, and not worth the hassle. I'd much rather spend my money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast place ! I've lived in a few states and every time I came back home I would eat here ! Great prices too ! Love the omelets and Potatoes!"}
