{"text":"There's honestly not great food around the city of Bellagio but we had this place and it was okay! The dishes were better than the pizza. I had the chicken. Pizza was extremely thin and flaky."}
{"text":"I had the burger special for 12.50.  It was the best burger (bacon, cheese, tomato, dill pickle ) I have had outside the US.  
I expect to go back during my 2-week stay."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Bellagio!  My family of five has been coming here for over eight years (every summer) and we absolutely love their pizzas.  Our favorite is the Lucifero, which is spicy and delicious.

It's also a a great spot to try a Panaché (pronounced \"pan nah shay\"), a popular drink that's a combination of a light beer and a citrusy soda like 7-Up.  Very refreshing on a hot summer day (even my girls who hate beer love this drink).

They also have pasta, burgers, steaks, and fantastic deserts like affogato al caffe (an affogato is a coffee-based dessert made with scoops of vanilla gelato topped with a shot of hot espresso and whipped cream).

The staff at Baba Yaga are so friendly and certainly make you feel welcomed.  They also have free wifi, which is nice."}
{"text":"Tout est parfait, service, nourriture, terrasse mais je mets une étoile de moins pour la vue de cette dernière : un mur.
La carte est très variée (pizza, pasta, Burgess,...) et les prix sont corrects, plutôt dans la tendance de la ville."}
{"text":"Pizza I've eaten quite a bit, but the pizza here? Never and it was amaze! The base was nice and thin, had the right amount of crunch and the flavour was outstanding, the addition of rosemary is genius. I usually don't bother with the crust, but here I had every bit. The chefs know what they're doing and the service is super friendly! Look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our meal here. 

The service was beyond excellent. Really friendly and personable! 

For dinner, we had two glasses of wine, a Caesar salad, buttered spinach, pizza margherita con salsiccia, a lucifero pizza, and creme brûlée. The salad and spinach were excellent. Our pizzas were good (and very big). We liked the very thin and crispy crust! The crust is different than much of what we found in Italy. We also had a creme brûlée, but it was not very good. Cold and a little liquidy at the bottom. Altogether our meal was not too expensive. 

The atmosphere is very nice. Very clean and modern, but comfortable. The outdoor patio is nice. 

Overall - food, atmosphere and service would be a 4/5."}
{"text":"Seul moyen de trouver une pizza à emporter à bellagio un soir à 22h30! Étonnant pour un 20 août ! Les pizzas sont corrects. Et accueil gentil pour heure tardive !"}
{"text":"A wine vendor suggested this Place for lunch and we were unsure when we first saw it since it didn't have a nice view of the lake but decided to try it anyway.  All i can say is i loved it! I had a pizza and it was one of the best i have ever had!"}
{"text":"Giant pizzas at affordable prices? Baba Yaga delivers the goods.

We sat outside under a giant umbrella while our poor, overworked waiter seemed to attend to every single table on the patio (and some inside, too). Everyone on the patio was smoking.

I ordered a Lucifero (spicy salami, basically pepperoni) pizza. It was 9 and it slayed my hunger. The crust was kind of crackery, and I would have preferred something chewy, but that's a small drawback.

The total bill for two people was 37, which is a steal for what we ate. (Also 9 of that was simply water because we were so ridiculously thirsty.)

One down side: Baba Yaga lets people bring their dogs on the porch, which would be fine if they were behaved, but we sat next to a table where the dog was freaking out and barking constantly. Yes, I know pet lovers will defend their drooling, panting, barking nightmare dining companion as some sort of God-given right, but not everyone shares your affection for your disgusting, loud fur baby."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place! My brother had a good dish of smoked salmon pasta, my father had pizza, and I chose to play it safe and got a mixed meat grill which was really delicious. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Bellagio. It's evident that it's popular because it was filled when other restaurants were almost empty."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Likely equally good steak - but their pizza is so good I never tried had the willpower to try anything else... :)"}
{"text":"The service was great!   Good was okay but considering the prices it's a good pick.  The pizza was really good!  It's quite and off the main road but the view doesn't offer you anything wonderful.   No lake views."}
{"text":"With tables outside under an awning and a beautiful interior, you can not go wrong no matter where you choose to be seated.  The staff is very friendly and they speak English which put me at ease and added to my positive experience.  We asked to sit outdoors under the awning. This is a nice size terrace with about a dozen tables, nicely spaced, and set with a heavy, cloth like paper cover with napkins of the same high quality and solid utensils.
Yelpers, once again you helped me make the perfect dining choice.  With the raves about the pizza and burgers, we had to try both.  They have a full menu and I couldn't dine on Lake Como without sampling some of their fresh lake fish, so we added that to the order as well.  Lets just say we 'paced' ourselves and they kindly allowed us to share each course.
First up was pizza.  My Fav added a little pepperoncini oil to spice his up.  The outer crust was cooked to a golden brown and crispy.  The interior crust was still soft enough that if desired, I could have 'folded' a slice to eat 'NY' style.  I used a knife and fork and very much enjoyed this pizza.  
After a bit of time to digest, next up was the cheeseburger. If you are an American, looking for some comfort food, look no further.  They have 'nailed' it!  This is an American style hamburger; grilled bun and all.  Lettuce, tomato and sliced pickles on the side to add if you choose.  The bacon is served 'crudo' and the burger cooked medium rare (we did not specify, but generally, you will get a burger in Italy rare to medium rare so specify if you want it well done!) Accompanied by steak fries, that were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, served with a sweet, barbecue ketchup that is very nice. 
Again, there was a nice delay before our next course of pan fried lake fish served with a side of vegetables and large lemon wedge.  The batter is similar to a tempura and the fish cooked light and fluffy. I am very glad I chose this dish at the suggestion of our waitress.
This was the first meal of the day for us, and yes, we ate a lot of food, but, I wasn't done yet. (Think I shocked the waitress!) A macchiato and tiramisu rounded up this meal.  From first bite, I was in love with this tiramisu. Creamy custard, soft cake, chocolate on top.  So glad I didn't skip dessert!  I would definitely stop at Baba Yaga again!"}
