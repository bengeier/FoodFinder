{"text":"Great Donairs with a perfect sweet sauce. Beef has a nice spiciness,  reminesent of some Donairs I had in Halifax (Kings and Venus). Family makes it a frequent stop now, always greeted with friendly service."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in need of a quick and healthy dinner. So we decided to try out the Donair Hut. We were pleasantly surprised the food was amazing and fresh - tasted awesome!  My husband had the chicken Donair which I tried and the garlic sauce was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great donairs. Lots of toppings to choose from. Staff is very friendly. I dont live in the area, but i make a point to stop in whenever i can."}
{"text":"A very friendly guy made my wrap here, yesterday. I got a small Falafel wrap that had 2 Falafels inside and was brimming with fresh toppings. It was decent, but I've honestly had better, and it was kind of weird that he scooped all the stuff that fell on to the cutting board back in to the wrap. Waste not, want not? Not a bad thing, just... weird. Back in you go, little toppings! You are going to get eaten, whether you like it or not! The beets and pickled cabbage were a nice addition. I also like that the sauces all seem to be housemade.   It's not the first Falafel place I'll suggest, unless you're in the area, but I'd come back. The service is genuinely pleasant and the food is solid."}
{"text":"hen Uncle Moes (now Donair Hut) opened in my neighbourhood more than a year ago, I was exited and glad to finally have a Donair Shop in the neighbourhood. However, after a couple of trips, this place has become somewhat...well neither consistently impressive or disappointing, but lackadaisical.  They offer the usual basic trio often found in a Donair shop: Donair and Shawarma meat, and Falafel. I  appreciate the neatness of the store, everything comes in tubs and tupperware, they also effectively use plastic gloves to ensure you have a neat wrap. Their dining room is OK, allowing you to eat your wrap in peace.   But I hate that there is a menu that shows charges for items that could go into your wrap: peppers, veggies, sauces, and cheese. Why don't they just jack up the price and have these things offered without any extra charges? Their wrap isn't that special either, it didn't taste horrible and the ingredients were fresh, as it should be. But everything seemed to be in proportion that the wrap looked a little flat. What really draws me into a donair shop is the fact that they just throw everything into the wrap with little guided measurements and everything according to the way you want your wrap to be. Replace the donair meat with cold cuts and the place could easily be mistaken for a Subway.  But seeing as there aren't any donair shops around the Bow Bottom Trail community areas, this place should be considered for a quick fix stop."}
{"text":"Wow. Homemade sauces and incredible toppings and optional cheese (Donair places never have cheese). This place is authentic and down right amazing."}
