{"text":"What an adorable coffee shop. It's small and doesn't have a lot of seating but when I went to study, the barista let me pull up a stool to the pastry counter and I got to study right near the action hehe. the coffee is lovely and the snacks are good but the winner is the charm of the place. Hilarious Polaroids of coffee puns and fun messages, incredible art hung up for sale, and a cute rustic nook feel in such a dry area of town. Lovely to pass by and grab a latte, chat with the baristas and chill a bit. Would recommend for the coffee adventurer who loves visiting new spots :)"}
{"text":"This is a cute little mom n' pop  cafe shop near my building. I decided to pop in and see what it is like. It is quite nice. It has chargers for your phone (Android and Apple) and the prices aren't too bad. I recommend getting a cup of coffee from this joint."}
{"text":"Very good espresso. Utterly friendly staff: everyone feels welcome. Nice athmosphere: cosy and positive. Such a coffe shop was really needed in the neighbourhood. Did I mention great espresso already?"}
{"text":"Best lattes in the area.  Gladly walk across the bridge to get a nice coffee. Look out for their brunch. Their brunch waffle sandwich is amazing."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop! We stopped by for coffee, but finally decided to get the sunday brunch. A good homemade Egg BLT with salad and hashbrowns. They even set up a tv table for us outside so we could catch some sun while eating our brunch."}
{"text":"a very tasty breakfast here. nice suggestions from the staff as to what to order. nice touch have fresh pastries for the road. would go back again"}
{"text":"Delicious coffee and great service. Love their cortados. The owners here are really friendly and have made the place really inviting and conducive to neighbourly conversation!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwiches? I think I've ever had? Plus good coffee, and exceedingly friendly staff (who I'm pretty sure are also the owners.) I wish they had different seating (it's stools at little ledges, so perfectly fine for gobbling a sandwich and a coffee, but not the place for lounging around with a friend or a laptop)."}
{"text":"Tried Atlas on the recommendation of the Cityplace Facebook group.   Very good food and coffee.  Will be back."}
{"text":"A wonderful coffee experience, the two brothers/owners were extremely friendly and inviting, as well as knowledgable about their craft. Their pastries were extremely authentic and light, perfectly complementing their coffee."}
{"text":"Friendly service, complimentary little amaretti & chocolate covered espresso beans with my cappuccino, & good selection of juices, snacks etc. I was impressed they also sell candles, soap & lotion, all atlas branded & with coffee as an ingredient! A gem of an indie coffee shop!"}
{"text":"I live in the condo next door and am so happy to have found this gem! It's a small, clean shop, but their coffee, pastries, and food are so delicious and their friendly service is wonderful!   I am partial to their mochas (cold or hot, both delectable!), chocolate croissants (crispy and buttery), and their brunch is amazing.   Had the good fortune to drop in on Good Friday and was treated to one of the better breakfasts I've had lately. Simple, unassuming, tasty: veggie omelette (usually served with bacon), light slaw (I don't even usually like slaw and it was good!), hash browns, and the tastiest brioche (light, fluffy, buttery, layered goodness).   Even with other coffee shops nearby, Atlas is now my go-to!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It offers friendly solace in a busy city, as well as expertly crafted coffee beverages. When Dale is preparing food, you do not want to say no. Delicious, and crafted with attention to detail and taste. Sandrine and Zion are delightful hosts who make me feel like I am truly having coffee with a friend."}
{"text":"Passed by this place.. The lady serving coffee is pleasant n friendly.. Cappuccino was okay and I tried the tasty choc banana bread.. Overall not a bad place to grab coffee on the go."}
{"text":"Great espresso and extremely friendly and welcoming hosts. There isn't much else around here but the addition of Atlas and the new Fort York branch of the library just over the bridge are beginning to make the neighbourhood feel more friendly. Coffee is served with small complimentary cookie and chocolates. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I like!    Just noticed this place the other day, located on the quiet, unassuming strip of Front St. between Portland and Bathurst.  If you're familiar with the area, there's really nothing right there, especially food wise so this is a welcome addition.    It's a relatively small shop but still has some room for seating inside, mostly bar seats.  There are wooden benches outside to enjoy your espresso beverage as well.  They have a small countertop pastry selection with gluten free options, and a limited sandwich menu.  They also offer single serve bottled juices.  The barista was friendly and welcoming  and I ordered a small americano ($2.75) which was served with some complimentary treats: 2 little chocolates and a small cookie, nice touch.    This place is fairly new and has been open for about 2 months so may have yet to gain a cult following but so far it seems like a great little spot.  If you know the Cityplace neighbourhood just across the footbridge you'll know that the neighbourhood is in serious need of some good coffee and luckily this is now a short walk away.    My encounter at Atlas Espresso Bar was brief but pleasant, and I definitely intend to come back for another caffeine fix."}
{"text":"A great place to start the day with a custom made omelette or any of the breakfast specialties throughout the week. But the best is the coffee, the way it is prepared, served and obviously the taste itself. The owner is super friendly and shows passion for his business and his clients. It is one of the independent shops, so come and support they, this is real craftsmanship!"}
{"text":"Arrived into cute little coffee shop with an equally cute dog (warning...not friendly) sitting outside! So I'm late for my appointment & I'm starving!! Vegetarian that doesn't eat cheese.....they make up a falafel hummus sandwich with a side of couscous!!! AMAZING!!!! Def going back soon! Great staff further heightened the experience!!! Go out of your way to go!!!!"}
{"text":"Support this small business! Really nice in there and good drinks/pastries. I got a Cortado (recommended sweetened with Honey and Cinnamon) with their danish (Cherry and goodness). We had a little interview in there and it had nice vibes with one of the owners being super nice."}
{"text":"Nope, no coffee for me.  Freshly squeezed OJ sure hit the spot on a warm day.    Folks here are very easy to talk to so I felt very welcomed.    Bar and stool seating is available.  Nice neighbourhood coffee joint."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem during our visit from Pittsburgh, PA thanks to the Yelp reviews. This is quite a unique spot with hipster flair. The two gentlemen working were very friendly. We got breakfast and coffee. The food was fresh, tasty and reasonably priced. The space is small, so may be better for take out if you are getting more than a coffee."}
{"text":"Such a  nice surprise walking along front w here. An Indy coffee shop w super chill owners and wonderful conversation. Such a gem in such a residential, business minded neighbourhood. It really is a breath of fresh air. Very intimate, get pricing for quality products and service. A must see when in the neighbourhood. Will return!"}
{"text":"Small coffee shop with limited seating space. It was too hot for a coffee so I opted for an Iced Americano which was around $3. It's fine if you're on the go and looking for a decent coffee shop but I wouldn't recommend it if you're planning to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is tiny with bar tables and orange stools, it wasn't as inviting as I intended but I read some good reviews before coming here.  The gentlemen who worked here was enthusiastic and friendly.  He welcomed us as soon as we walked in on a cold winter afternoon and asked what we would like.  I decided to try their cappuccino and was interested in trying their daily special which was a Beef Brisket Sandwich but they were sold out for the day.  The cappuccino was smaller than I expected but it was delicious, nonetheless.  The barista that made my cappuccino even topped it off with a lovely coffee design.  I will definitely come back and visit but next time, I will try to come earlier in the day to try their pastries and enjoy another hand-crafted coffee."}
{"text":"Lovely small family run coffee spot with good breakfast and lunch. Very small with no proper tables but super cosy and delicious."}
{"text":"Atlas is an absolute gem.  Although small, Atlas is packed with different options to satisfy your caffeine addiction. Not to mention, they offer a wide variety of baked goods and brunch/lunch items (cleverly advertised on their chalkboard each morning).   This is about as authentic and chill as it gets. Not to mention, they serve each brew/drink with a different cookie! (Who doesn't love that).  This place is not only adorable, but is always quick. Definitely check them out.  Great vibe, great people, great menu."}
{"text":"Nice owners, decent food & decent coffee.   But let's be real here - for a place that offers so many varieties of cooked food the space is just not set up for someone to stay in and eat.   It's fine for a quick takeout coffee"}
{"text":"I usually come here for an americano or latte when I'm in the area. Their americanos are decent and always piping hot. I also recommend trying their almond croissants, they are sweet and buttery. Although I've never tried their breakfast/brunch options before, they do offer more than just coffee and pastries for those who are looking for a weekend brunch.  The owner is very friendly and makes an effort to chat with all the patrons, which is always nice!"}
{"text":"Mmmm the americano is so smooth! Makes me wish i got the large size. There isn't a whole lot of seating, likely more grab n go, but i was thoroughly impressed with the red curry sole that was cooking in the background - just my luck today's lunch special! The barista/chef was  also super friendly!"}
{"text":"Had a really amazing Beef stew, which was the special of the day. I was really impressed by the heartiness of it. It tasted like a winter Sunday afternoon après ski.  Everyone is super friendly :)"}
{"text":"The nicest service ever.  On a trip from NYC, on my way back to the airport, in the pouring rain with no umbrella, I followed my compass toward Atlas.  The owner (so sorry I forgot your name!) whipped up a hearty pasta lunch, great coffee, and we had a nice chat about Toronto and NYC.  I spent my last Canadian currency here and when it was $1.75 short, she said it was fine and just to pay it forward!  And also found an umbrella that someone left behind that I could use.  Canadians are so nice!  I wish Atlas could bottle that friendliness up and distribute it around the world."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the BEST coffee shops in Toronto. Family owned and operated and a place where you not only taste the goodness, you also feel the soul. There is no place that I would rather be than here, drinking coffee and eating the daily specials with any of the other awesome people who have discovered this spot."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast the other day. Had an omelette and a curtado. Very small, cute place. Good food. Nice staff. Enjoyed it! a lil gem nearby."}
{"text":"Very nice espresso bar. They give you nice complimentary snacks and the staff is extremely helpful. I've never had espresso before and wanted to try it and the person behind the counter was nice, knowledgeable, and helpful through the process. The espresso was nice and strong, it had a nice sour note too it but also sweet especially when you put a sugar cube in it ! Really nice and cute spot."}
{"text":"I was hoping to find a place to work with great coffee. I understand some places do not have working room and I am fine with it but you don't have to be rude about it. The moment I walked in and looked around the staff asked if I was looking for a place to work I just frankly answer yes. He waved me out and yelled \"UH UH I don't want that here.\"  Attitude can turn a lot of people away from your shop forever."}
{"text":"Really pleasant staff and good coffee. Flourless brownie was ace, really great little coffee shop."}
{"text":"Great vibe and friendly owner.  I ordered the americano with an almond croissant. The complimentary chocolate and jelly beans were a nice thought.  The americano was piping hot.  Almond croissant I wish I asked for it to be heated up.   I would've preferred less powdered sugar in the croissant but if you're into really sweet pastries, then this you'll like.  There's a brunch menu which I like to try one day.   Loved the benches with blankets outside the cafe. I imagined coming here with my boyfriend enjoying our coffee on the benches while we sit with our dogs. Indoor seating is limited.  There's stools and bar tables but owner said people come and go fairly quickly so waiting for a seat is never too long.     Will definitely visit again!"}
