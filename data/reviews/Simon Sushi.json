{"text":"Been to this restaurant two times. They have very friendly staff! As usual, I would get my usual, a bento box. It was average tasting, like most other sushi restaurants. However, it wasn't as pricey as others which is a good sign. Bonus, they have free wifi!"}
{"text":"Put simply, this place offers excellent food at even more amazing prices.

I eat here all the time and have sampled most things on the menu.

First point of attraction: $6 lunch special, and \"lunch\" actually goes until 5pm. I go to Japanese places for lunch all the time and this place has the most well-assembled bento boxes and sushi specials of anywhere in the area. There's also a great  soup special which is huge. Also included for lunch is miso soup, green tea and orange slices for dessert.

Dinner/regular menu is obviously more expensive, but they throw in lots of freebies, which is really nice: you get edamame, maki rolls (usually suicide or salmon skin), and ice cream on the house on top of the usual miso, green tea and orange. There are lots of great sushi, maki, sashimi, and meal combos. There is also quite a large assortment of a la carte items. Also vegetarian friendly!

The service is good here. The waitresses here are average, most of them are attentive and prompt, but some are extra friendly. The best service, however, comes from the chef/owner, Simon. Sometimes if it isn't too busy, he will come and ask you how your meal was, and if you order lots of food or he recognizes you as a regular sometimes he gives you extra sushi or appetizers for free. He really knows how to take care of his customers!

As for the food, both from the kitchen and sushi bar, it is excellent. The meats, especially the fish, are very fresh. I eat here all the time and have never had a problem with the quality of the food.

My recommendations: K-10, S-5, Oyako Don, Salmon Salad Roll, Crunchy Roll, Sashimi/Sushi Bronze, Gyoza, Yam 'n avocado roll...there are so many good options, it is pretty hard to go wrong!

(Also side note, they don't accept debit here)"}
{"text":"Delivery was fast. Got a free Sweet potato roll, but that couldn't take away from a rancid flavour and very wet almost mushy rice in the sushi."}
{"text":"We came for sushi, and it was disappointing. I'm from Vancouver, and so I keep dreaming of finding the kinds of cheap, tasty sushi deals I know about out there. But this wasn't it (being an optimist, I intend to keep looking and will post here if I find such a place!). 

We both ordered off the lunch special menu ($5.99)--the california roll and spicy tuna roll combo. The california roll was okay--adequate, but nothing special (and I've had many cali rolls through the years, in Vancouver *and* Toronto!). 

The spicy tuna roll was about the worst I've ever had (it's usually one of my faves)--not spicy, and the tuna tasted odd, as if it had been placed beside something and been contaminated with the flavour of the other item... or something. It tasted wrong. Since raw fish was involved, after the first piece, I decided not to take any risks and set aside the rest. So did my companion. 

Now *this* is the positive part (i.e. why I gave them three stars instead of two)--where I expected a \"too bad\" kind of attitude, because it was a lunch special, the server actually conveyed our disappointment to management (I had been debating about whether to complain or not, but then the server stopped by to ask how our meals were going and so we told her that we weren't going to have our tuna rolls because they tasted odd). We were able to substitute the tuna rolls for the yam avocado rolls, which were pretty good. 

I should say that looking around at the bento boxes that were being served to many other people there, they looked really good! Generous quantities and people seemed to be devouring them pretty enthusiastically. So perhaps if I were forced come again, for whatever reason, I'd have one of those instead."}
{"text":"The service is quick and deliteful.  The restaurant is clean and sanitary.  Simon's sushi is very tasty, each item having a unique flavour.  Simon is dedicated to the art of preparing fine food.  He prepares the sushi at an open bar at the back of the restaurant and the hot food comes from a large clean kitchen. Students from University of Toronto dine there on a regular basis because the prices are very reasonable, priced to keep the students coming back for more.  I have taken friends there on many occasions and every friend has been pleased.  I treated one of the toughest sushi critics, a wealthy lady who has travelled the world, to Simon Sushi.  She picked whatever she wanted from the extensive menu and after dinner she gave Simon Sushi two thumbs up.  This is not a fancy romantic Japanese style sit-on-the-floor restaurant. with traditional music in the air.  It's a regular restaurant with a pleasant vibe, East Asian overtones, and good food at great prices.  I like to try different sushi places as a dining hobby, but I keep coming back to Simon's place."}
{"text":"The only positive thing I have to say about this place is that the owner (I think he is anyway) Simon is pretty friendly. He says hello and goodbye to most of the customers. But this alone cannot convince me to go back for two reasons.

1) rudeness. I had the chicken terriyaki once. It was very obvious that the chicken was too old. Anyone who's had expired chicken in their fridge know that undeniable stink. This crap smelled like that even though it was doused in terriyaki sauce and burned on both sides. Even my dinning companion smelled it across the table... Instead of freaking out, I just assumed that it was an oversight and calmly asked for a replacement, explaining the reason. Instead of apologizing for this, as she should have, the waitress gave me the dirtiest look and YANKED the food off the table. She did eventually came back with a plate that didn't reek of poo, but she tossed it onto the table with even more attitude than the first time. So maybe she was new/inexperienced, however, nobody else apologized for the behaviour, the oh-so-friendly chef Simon didn't make an appearance.  I never went back after this incident.

2) before the shitty terriyaki incident, I had tried their lunch menus on two incidents and was sorely disappointed on both times. YES it's only 5.99, but you truly got what you paid for here. The portions were TINY, the tempura (in the bento) was soggy and cold. The rolls were 80% rice, and they tried to replace any \"good\" bits like fish, crab, or avocado with huge pieces of cucumber. Honestly, I'm not a fan of the quality of the Sushi on Bloor 5.99 lunches either, but that's way better than what they try to sell at this place."}
{"text":"The prices here are very good especially being in a downtown location. They have a lunch special that goes from 11am to 5pm which is $6.50 for a good variety of bento boxes of sorts with maki and stuff. We opted to try something else since we were hungry. We ordered 5 different maki rolls.

BC Scallop Roll: Tasty, and one of their better rolls.
Uni Roll: Didn't taste super fresh, and wasn't too much filled with Uni.
Hamachi Deep Fried Roll: A bit dry, and probably the worst out of the 5 rolls.
Deep Fried Unagi Roll: This is the usual tasty one with avocado.
Yam/Avocado Roll: This is sweet creamy combo. Great for vegetarian!

We also got fried tofu with some sauce. 

Overall, the rolls were of decent quality and portion was good anywhere from 6-8 pieces per roll. Their spider roll and lobster roll were fairly cheap at under $10. We would come back just to eat more variety of cheap rolls."}
{"text":"Avocado! Fake crab! Orange fish eggs! If you love California rolls, get yourself to Simon Sushi around lunch time. For $5.99 you get miso soup, a small salad, six pieces of California roll, and six pieces of another choice -- I went for the 'crunchy roll' which had salmon, avocado, and tempura batter bits inside. You can also choose chicken or salmon teriyaki, which comes served in an impressive box with tempura and, you guessed it, California rolls. All and all it's not a bad deal."}
{"text":"We always order takeout from here so I can't comment on the restaurant experience. The sushi is always fresh, much cheaper than other places, and comes within 30 minutes. The sushi platter has about 40-45 pieces on it and is only $32.00 or so. They also throw in a free order of edamame sometimes! I will definitely keep ordering takeout from here."}
{"text":"Good place, especially their pretty cheap lunch specials, where you can get sushi or bento boxes (teriyaki beef is my favourite). Usually everything is fresh, but once fish in sushi tasted like yesterday's, and that was sad. Also, my husband and I notice that when you order a lunch special and you are alone, they serve you very quickly, but if there are two (or more) people for lunch, you have to wait for a while to get your orders."}
{"text":"I love this place! the food is great and everything is so cheap! I've been going here regularly since last summer. The staff are very prompt and friendly and memorized my usual order (which I love)"}
{"text":"Loved their don and sushi. The don was very flavorful with its eggs cooked on top of beef and onions (and only slightly less than $10).

The sushi was pretty good, but the wasabi was exceptionally hot. Considering this is coming from a person who can eat half a spoonful of wasabi with only a mild burn, I was extremely surprised that tears came out of my eyes from such a tiny bite of wasabi. I *love* spicy food, and especially wasabi, but never in my life have I *cried* tears of pain over food, much less spicy food! I know this sounds like a bad thing, but I really loved it! :)

Excellent service as well! The waiter greeted us instantly and got us a table before we fully entered the restaurant. We got frequent refills for our drinks, and the waiter was nice and observant enough to point out where the washroom was soon after my friend got up to find it. The complimentary warm tea, maki roll appetizer, and fortune cookie were excellent bonuses too!

Oh, fun fact, they also have 304 options to order from. I felt a little bad for taking so long to order, but there were really too many options to choose from! :P

Also, free wifi. \o/"}
{"text":"Worst sushi I've ever had. The water glasses were dirty and had spots of grease on then like the dishwasher has never been cleaned. The plates also had a film of grease on them. Even the walls next to our table were filthy. Any rolls we ordered with tempeura were burnt. Slow service, unfriendly staff. Prices were on par with other sushi places in the city. I will not be going back"}
{"text":"This place has dirt cheap prices and if you're looking for the biggest bang for your buck, then come here. Otherwise, the quality is not the greatest and I found the sushi really mushy and the vegetarian spring rolls too oily.

The waitresses were attentive and food came out really quick. But, my friend and I being the only ones there in addition to another couple of guys maybe says something about the place."}
{"text":"The sushi is quality, the service is great.... but most importantly - the PRICES ARE AWESOME.

Sometimes I just want a sushi lunch without having to pay $20+. This is the place. $5.99 lunch specials are amazing. They don't skimp on the quality at all. I split 3 lunch specials with a buddy and we eat like kings for under $20 total.

I will go back often.

Awesome."}
{"text":"Really like this place - we've been a couple times and I'm sure we'll be back. They seem to use quality ingredients (real crab instead of the imitation stuff, actual salad instead of just flavourless iceberg lettuce at most sushi places, etc). We've had the sashimi, different kinds of sushi rolls, the spicy chicken, among other things and everything has always been great.
Would recommend trying it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Used to be my favourite place until this spring, food is inexpensive and I'm in the area often so I was a reoccurring customer. I used to go there and always get the same thing, tofu, suicide roll and/or yam tempura roll. Always tasted great. Sometimes the service is nice, sometimes they just don't care.  The place looks great and is well decorated and the tv is a great plus. I've been coming for years and it just seems the quality is depleting..

Unfortunately for me my last visit resulted in FOOD POISONING. As I always get the same thing, I believe it was a hygienic problem. I've not been since and don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"WOW.. from 'myeh' it turned to 'NEVER AGAIN' in less than 5visits. 

The food is HORRID!. Edemame was cold. From the skin you can tell it's been out for a while. *Barf* 

the deep friend claifornia rolls could easily be the worst mush mixture I have ever tasted. Now I know, if ever there is a time I need to puke, I will picture this dish and just like that...the hurling feeling comes to the pit of my stomach. 

I am so so sad. This is the end of this place for me. 

There should seriously be an option of NO star rating. 

xoxo

{"text":"From the outside, this place looks like a holed-up shack. A shack that should have a \"CONDITIONAL PASS\" or \"CLOSED\" flyer from a city health inspector stamped outside its door. 

You really have to have some insane motivation to cross the street to find out that it's actually open. 1/5 stars shouldn't be enough to make you do that.  

Simon has a $6 sushi lunch special. 




In Chinatown.  





Sushi and Chinatown sound good, right?  





China's pretty damn close to Japan.  





The sushi couldn't be THAT bad. 








Lest we forget that knock-offs from CHINA make headline news for being impregnated with lead, I'll tell you that this place is bad. I should have just killed a salmon with my bare hands and eaten it Bear-Grylls style right outside on Spadina. 

I think my lunch would have been a pleasant experience that way. 

The sushi is mushy and tasteless. The miso soup looks like fish piss and tastes like absolutely nothing. The salad dressing made me wonder if China also makes knock-off Kraft salad dressing. 

I really don't know what I was thinking. All I know is that I'm bringing lunch from home for a few days to recover."}
{"text":"I am a fan of AYCE restaurants when it comes to sushi, but this time I only wanted a few certain items to feed my craving. I was passing by Simon Sushi many times and today finally decided to give it a try. 
The place itself is very clean, furniture is new, nothing there looks overwhelming. 
The woman on the counter was very welcoming and took our order to go when we were ready to place it. The wait time was about 10-15 min. It was so hot outside, that's why the perceptive waitress gave us ice water without even asking, what we were very grateful for. 
Food was really fresh and delicious! I am being a salmon lover ordered a \"salmon salad\", which was amazingly made. The philli roll was also very good with the proportionally right  amount of rice to other ingredients. During the lunch time they serve special sets of rolls, which goes with soup and green salad for $10 in total. 
I recommend this place to dine in. The quality of food and prices will pleasantly surprise the guests."}
{"text":"Went here because Dani sushi was closed. I found that the portions are on the smaller side. The sushi rice was too sour, meaning that the chef had added too much vinegar. That ruined the experience for me. 

(Not sure if this was intentional) but it seemed as if the sides of the salmon sushi were a bit cooked? I also found that some of the other sushi fish were hard to chew. The California Maki roll was good though (small). 

Waitress is nice and attentive. 

The store is a bit confusing on what exactly they want to present themselves as. It seems to be a sushi/cafe spot."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food, 100 stars for the service and volume of food.

I went in for a take-out, and they served me with a sushi piece and Edamame to try out.
I ordered the Sushi Bento Box for $15 including tax - the volume was so large I almost couldn't finish it. It came with;

Rice&Beef Short Ribs (which almost amounts to a full meal)
5 pieces of tempura
3 fried dumplings
6 pieces of sushi
Salad
Miso Soup

The service was amazing too - recommended for all hungry people!"}
{"text":"Overrated, last resort food. Experienced a price hike and quality drop right before they close. Farewell Simon~"}
{"text":"I have only ordered delivery from Simon Sushi and their service and quality is reliable. 
One time I wanted an earlier delivery and they were able to cater to my request.

Three important things:
1. They consistently deliver an hour earlier than expected...so make sure someone is home!
2. They always include something on the house, sometimes it could be maki and sometimes it is edamame. Yay free stuff!
3. You can order from JustEat or from their website, I have tried both and for some reason...ordering from their website turned out to be cheaper (due to the tax calculation I think).

They have a lot of turnover so the fish is quite fresh. Fried foods often arrive still crispy and warm. 
I like the BC Roll, which I learnt is not at all like the BC Roll in BC as it contains scallop (in generous portions). 
Their salmon sashimi and maki are good! Big pieces and fresh. 
The party trays are also a good deal to split between friends.

Not a big fan of their tempura veggies--the batter makes me a bit nauseated after a few bites.
I don't like the spicy tuna rolls either because the tuna is all mushed up...why? 
The spicy salmon hand cone was a ripoff ($3.45) but I needed something to bump my order up to $25. It was dinky and there was wayyy too much hot sauce in the spicy mayo sauce. It ruined the taste of salmon. Poor fishy. 

All in all, it is a good choice if you need a cheap, fairly good sushi fix."}
{"text":"Newly opened, gave it a try a few days ago for lunch. It was excellent! Ordered the Fire Dragon, Lakeshore and Suicide rolls with miso soup. 

The only bad thing : I'm now torn between Simon and Dani Sushi (just a few doors down). I love both, how will I decide each time I need sushi?"}
{"text":"Yum! My BF and I frequent this sushi joint. For under $10 you can get a bento box that is full of goodies... teryaki, dumplings, 6 pieces of sushi, shrimp and veggie tempura and the list goes on and on.

The waitresses and the the chef (Simon!) are so friendly and they always give you more than you ordered. 

This place is great for take out or for eating in."}
{"text":"Nice little sushi joint on Lake Shore W that fits the bill in the neighbourhood.

They had a very large assortment of roll choices. I chose the bagel (cream cheese, smoked salmom) & yam/avocado. The tempura was done well on the yam. My husband picked a medium tray that featured a nice mix of fresh sashimi including tuna. We were also provided a small salad with a delicious ginger/peanut butter dressing, as well as a cup of miso soup. The green tea was served piping hot.

The server was super friendly & attentive.

My only comment is that, for the price, we expected a bit of a better quality. The rice was on the dry side."}
{"text":"So this review is mostly about the incredible service at Simon Sushi. When I tell you it's above and beyond, I'm not joking. I never joke about serious things. They run a brisk operation at Simon Sushi, but it's totally friendly and accommodating. 

When my friend was ordering, the gentleman taking our order suggested she opt for the lunch menu item which was essentially the same but \"more economical\". The woman who was sorting out our bills was thrilled to be giving us change which included the new Canadian $10 bill, and deeply regretted that she was unable to provide the third member of our dining party with a shiny new banknote as well. My dining partners were also delighted with the scooped and segmented orange which finishes off the meal, adorned with a simple yet effective toothpick. 

I only take off one star because the sushi itself is average, but it's quite appropriate considering the menu's price point. In the future, when dining as a couple, I'd also like to take advantage of the romantic alcove near the front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was subpar and took way too long. Dani sushi is waaaay better.  Go there to avoid disappointment"}
{"text":"Came here with 3 friends on a Friday evening, under a recommendation of a friend who had eaten at the restaurant before, with a positive experience. Walking in and being seated, my friends and I were one of the only ones in the restaurant around the time we arrived (around 8:30pm), so the service was efficient with orders and it came in a timely manner. The menu has a nice and diverse selection, and the dishes ordered tasted good. The rolls I got satisfied my craving for sushi and my overall hunger for under $10, I'm glad. If I am in the CT area again and craving sushi (but let's be honest, when am I not?), I would come again! I like that the place has free WiFi btw. Very good for instagramming food (just kidding. I didn't, I do take pictures for Yelp and blogging purposes though!)

{"text":"Service isn't the best but sushi is pretty good. Lunch specials for the win :) dinner is a tad pricy"}
{"text":"super cheap, super friendly service, super fast.  love coming here, it's not spectacular food, but it's very humble.  love this place."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Very good sushi, cheap prices, and we were even given free sake for reasons still unbeknownst to us. THEY JUST GAVE US FREE SAKE. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch special. Got a california roll, yam tempura roll, soup, and salad then paid extra to finish with green tea ice cream. The price was right and the lunch special goes all the way until 5 PM. The food was tasty but the sushi rice was warm which I didn't really care for. I'm not sure if they did that on purpose or if there was some kind of failure in refrigeration. The miso soup was tastier than most places. They brought fruit with the bill which I like. Very nice touch. I would probably go back if hungry in the area."}
{"text":"OK OK... Let's talk about the price first. $6 lunch special is CHEAPER than Burger King or Popeye Chicken next door! Would you rather have a fine Japanese meal or burger? You decide!

Now what about the food? At the first couple of visits, I ordered different kinds of food like sushi, maki, sashimi, rolls, udon..etc. After I tasted them all, I narrowed down to 2-3 items which I order ALL THE TIME. You can't go wrong with sushi and noodles.

I always like to order sushi special S7 without avocado. (I don't eat avocado cuz I don't like the texture)

Honestly, I went to Simon Sushi for over 100 times. I had NEVER feel sick after the meal. The food is always decent and clean - not outstanding. Price is right. Food is average - maybe above average in Chinatown area. You know what I mean...?

Food Quality: Good
Service: Nice service most of the time
Price: Outstanding price
Overall: 4/5"}
{"text":"Great Sushi  - perfect lunch spot with great atmosphere and food! My only complaint - the hours !! Went for an early lunch and it doesn't open till noon!! Went again on a Monday and they are closed ! It's too busy an area to be that selective about your hours !!"}
{"text":"Add one more star for the service.
The food was really below average sushi restaurants.

It is all about the cut in sashimi culinary art and the chef doesn't have any cutting skills. All their sashimi come in a big bulk like being bought right away from a supermarket with some random slicing. 

It is all about the rice when it comes to make sushi. The rice should be sticky enough to make the raw fish attached so it will not easily fall off when you pick it up. But here, the sushi comes in a gigantic chunk and the raw fish is not at all attached to the rice.

I am surprised to see they have such a high rating everywhere. I guess their good service made people happy. But if you have any knowledge of tasting Japanese food, you will not appreciate this place."}
{"text":"Service was quite nice. Other than that, the quality of food was pretty bad (I had the bento box) and certainly not worth the price tag. The only half- decent thing I had there were the salmon rolls."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi in town. Really nice people there and the service is good. Simon is the chef himself and he's there all the time cooking every dish. Highly recommended. Prices are very affordable."}
{"text":"Great sushi and sushimi, especially considering the options in the area. We ordered salmon and butter fish sushimi, along with dyno and BC rolls. In house dressing and and miso were great! Would come back again."}
{"text":"I can't understand why people come to this place.  When this place first opened up barely anyone went.  Now when I walk by I see tons of people inside.  I guess this goes to show you that if there is a lacking presence of good sushi places people will settle for anything less than stellar.

The beef tepanyaki was ok but the rice definately wasn't that great.  It was too soft and almost mushy.

You should definately try other options in this area.  If you have a sushi craving, either go to Bloor St or just settle for something else in the area that is just as good.  I suggest going to either New Ho King for chinese food or even mother's dumplings.  

Satiate your sushi fix another time and keep on walking, there are other places to eat and waste your money on."}
{"text":"Simon Sushi is a decent spot for reasonably priced sushi and Asian lunch plates. The California roll I had was über fresh, but the tuna roll was just ok. I wished they had low sodium soy sauce.

Service here could improve, but the same could be said for every sushi place in town.

At the end of the day, this place is good, but needs a little freshening of decor, better service, and the freshest sushi to stand out.

They do a neatly sliced orange at the end of the meal, which is a nice touch that helps cut the salt .

3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Portions are small while being overpriced. Better to go to Dani Sushi next door where you can get better deals and high quality food."}
{"text":"I originally had a review here, but deleted it as I felt I was being a bit biased (Simon is actually my uncle, let's just say). I decided to wait for my next visit to give a more unbiased review on how I really think of this restaurant. That next visit was last night.

A few things to note: Simon, while still the owner, is no longer the main sushi chef. He recently hired a chef for the sushi counter, and Simon these days either works in the kitchen or does deliveries. He only works in the sushi counter when the main sushi chef isn't available.

As for the food, the starters remain consistently good: Miso soup (with the real seaweed instead of wakame), salad with the thousand island sauce, and edamane. Occasionally Simon even offers cooked salmon head as a starter, although I'm unfortunately not a cooked fish person.

I ordered a la carte sashimi with toro, tako, ikura, tobiko, and ika. I liked the ika the most, and was disappointed with the toro (true toro sashimis are supposed to be \"tough\", this one just melted in my mouth). The ikura and tobiko sashimi are both okay, though I keep forgetting they have the cucumber as the base for sashimi orders instead of roll-style for sushi orders.

The oranges to finish up the meal are always a welcome option, and they usually taste very good after waiting about a minute as they come straight from the refrigerator.

Service tonight was on the poor side. They had 3 waitresses on shift, but I never saw more than one in the actual dining area serving customers. Definitely a lack of organization compared to other restaurants I've been to; despite the fact Simon Sushi has been around for the better part of 10 years, the employees felt like it was their first month on shift.

That being said though, I won't argue when the total cost I paid for the whole meal was $20 including taxes and tips.

{"text":"There are three items I have tried and very much enjoyed. 
1. Agedashi tofu (tempura tofu) 
2. Salmon sushi pizza
3. Red bean ice cream

There are several things I like about Simon Sushi: 
-lemon water is icy cold and refreshing 
-complimentary miso soup 
-you may be offered edamame
-they give you TWO big scoops of ice cream 

While their salmon sushi pizza isn't quite like what I'm used to eating at Wasabi (keele and bloor), it was quite scrumptious and I very much enjoyed it for what it was. Note: there are no onions on it, and the mayonnaise isn't spicy. 

I would return occasionally if I'm nearby, hungry and craving those items, but I wouldn't go out of my way just to eat there."}
{"text":"I'm so excited that Simon Sushi chose to relocate to Long Branch! 
Brought my kids for late lunch, we ordered 
a Veg Roll Set (for me), a miso soup, 2 steamed rice, 1 order of salmon sashimi, 3 orders of salmon sushi and an Asahi (beer for me!).

My kids love fish, they inhaled everything in minutes, it was all very fresh and nicely presented. 
I absolutely loved the ginger dressing in my salad, so much flavour, definitely not the typical dressing that you're usually served at most sushi places, I'd love to order a bucket of it for my fridge so I can pour it on everything haha

The service was fast and very pleasant, complimentary fresh fruit (cherries, plums and dragon fruit) at the end of our meal was a nice bonus!

Looking forward to my next visit without the kids so I can sample more of their adult drinks :)"}
{"text":"3.5/5 stars!

I really like Simon Sushi! This place serves miso soup to every customer who comes in to dine.  I used to work in the area, so I would get their lunch specials for $5.99. For lunch, I've tried the avocado/cucumber rolls with yam rolls; House noodle soup, crispy rolls, bento box, etc. All delicious.

I have also been here for dinner a couple of times, and it tends to be a lot less busy during this time.  The great thing about dinner is that the chef gives a complimentary piece of their suicide roll as well as edamame! 

The atmosphere is sort of run down a bit.  They really should renovate and fix up the walls and decor.  The service is decent; however, most of the waitresses don't speak English very well, so it's difficult to make any special requests if you have any."}
{"text":"UPDATE: The lunch specials have increased by a whole $0.50  ($6.49) and they have shiny, new menus (instead of those laminated pieces of paper). Otherwise, nothing has changed."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE! Thought it was decent until I found hair in the tempura. And not just on top of the food but mixed in with the batter. I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Prices are very good, making it a great location for a work lunch. They have a lot of decent lunch specials. Service is usually really good, friendly and efficient staff. Good place for a quick and inexpensive bite."}
{"text":"Kind of mediocre, the wait was long and the food was incredibly bland. Felt like we left disappointed and the meals weren't worth what we pay for... we ordered the poke bowl and I've never had one so plain before, my husband had the pork katsu and the veg and meat were so bland as well, it's like they didn't cook with any seasoning at all. Wanted to give this new place a try but after this we won't be going back. It's rare to get Japanese food poorly done so it's a bit unfortunate."}
{"text":"I've been here about four times, the service is quite quick and the staff is pretty friendly. The menu selection is impressive as they serve rolls that I've never heard of before which is always exciting and the prices aren't too bad for a sushi place. Usually when I try new things here I enjoy them, though the portion sizes are a bit small for my liking. I recommend the fire season roll!"}
{"text":"Ppl here are quite nice and friendly. It's a great place to have sushi! I am touched by their attitude, it makes me feel warm. Although they do not have all you can eat, I would like to go just because of them. The sushi there is great."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This review is based on take out experiences only

This is a fantastic place and I'd recommend it to any person looking for cheap sushi. I can't think of another place in downtown Toronto that provides cheap sushi that's still tasty and comes with friendly service. 

The sushi roll selection is standard for Toronto and will likely have your favourites. The thing with cheap sushi places is that typically the fish isn't too flavourful. That is the case with this place, but even so it doesn't have too much of that frozen taste quality that other joints do. Also nice is the fact that their rice is very nicely seasoned, providing a bit of a kick to the whole roll.

But perhaps my favourite thing overall, is the free roll or side dish they give without fail to my take out orders. I've had the chance to try new rolls for free which has lead me to order them later. 

This place is also staffed by some really nice folk. They talk to you and ask you about your day. This can be a bit of a rarity in any restaurant you visit, so I found the experience a nice change. 

Again, this is cheap sushi. But for your cheap sushi needs this place is can't be beat in the area."}
{"text":"Although the $5.99 lunch deals are fewer and farther between in this part of the city than others, Simon Sushi doesn't seem to need any significant competition for motivation. With 10 choices each of rolled sushi and cooked options to choose from, it's kind of hard not to find something that you might like. Otherwise quite regular California rolls are garnished with an eye-catching sprinkle of tobiko. Tempura yam and avocado rolls come generously stuffed.  

The only subtractors were the gratuit sides. The rich, creamy dressing atop the green salad was unfortunately heavily watered down for a lack of proper post-wash drainage and the miso soup was one of the blandest I'd ever had.

Meanwhile, dinner at Simon Sushi has yet to disappoint. Despite usually being a lot busier than during the day, everything still arrives artfully plated. The large and colourful menu makes sharing multiple dishes with friends a good way to try a bunch of items."}
{"text":"I had to run some errands on my lunch break and needed to grab something fast in the area.  A sudden craving for sushi led us to Simon Sushi.

This busy Chinatown sushi joint was packed with hungry U of T students and lunchers a like.  We ordered from a long list of lunch specials (all $6.50) - California & Crunchy Rolls and the Teriyaki Beef Bento Box.  Our meals came with free green tea, miso soup and salad which is pretty standard.  

Service is quick and food came not too long after ordering.  The bento box is definitely the better value for the money and big eaters.  It comes with rice, 3 pieces of sushi, 6 pieces of tempura veggies and tender pieces of medium done beef teriyaki.  The sushi special wasn't anything special.  Standard, run of the mill rolls, slightly better than getting them at Loblaws.

The bill was accompanied by fresh chunks of orange.  They were sour but it was a nice added touch.  Overall, not a horrible experience for us as described by a few reviews below.

Simon sez eat the passable sushi."}
{"text":"I was ordering from Simon Sushi for about two years without ever knowing where the place actually was -- we got a flyer in the mail and since they delivered for free, they won our love.

The food was always good, sometimes a little warm (which is not a great temperature for raw fish), but generally decent. It always came within the time they told us it would, but they never really offered a lot of extras (soy sauce, extra rice, etc).

When I finally ended up in the actual restaurant on Spadina for lunch, I had the same opinion. Everything was OK. I guess I've eaten a lot of sushi, and the only thing about Simon Sushi that stood out was their lunch is REALLY cheap. I remember it being about $5 for some combos. Not bad at all, but it wasn't a huge portion of food either.

Basically, if you're stuck on Spadina and are craving sushi, Simon works. It's DEFINITELY better than Sushi Star across the street, so stick with Simon and everything will be fine. But if you can venture out past Bathurst on College, you'll find better places."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery tonight from Simon's for the first time. While I wasn't overly wowed by anything i had, there were stand-out points that I appreciated. 

The clams cooked in Sake were nice - a unique flavour that complimented the sweetness of the clams. The only taste that didn't seem to make sense in that dish was the green onion. They send a free maki roll (first time thats ever happened to me!) which was a fantastic gesture. I've read a few negative reviews about the miso soup, but it was standard and enjoyable. Now, there were a couple things that confused me, or weren't what I was expecting. Two of my rolls seemed wrong - one was a specialty roll that I think I either misread the description of, or just got the wrong roll. It was still ok. The other roll was a spicy roll, but it wasn't spicy at all - no traditional spicy mayo or anything. It was just a salmon roll with roe in it. 

I also, thanks to a documentary I saw once, tend to judge a restaurant on their tamago. I found the tamago at simon's to be unusually sweet, but still a good texture. Not the best I've ever had. Oh, and the rice was good. I've read some bad reviews about it as well, but I had no qualms with the rice. Texture, stickiness and taste was pretty on par with what I would expect from your standard sushi place. 

Anyways, I rate tough, and I've had better sushi. When it comes down to it, next time I order, I'll probably try another sushi joint. There are too many options in this city not to."}
{"text":"I've never actually eaten in person here, but ordered take out from Just-Eat a few times. Personally I love eating expensive Japanese food, sea urchin, roe, toro etc., usually expensive Japanese ingredients are only served in higher-end restaurants that don't do take out, so I was pleasantly surprised and drawn to this restaurant to order my fix of uni. 

Often, the most crucial part to a nice Japanese meal is the quality of its ingredients; too often have I gone to legitimate Japanese restaurants, order the uni only to taste its putrid stale week-old uni. Fortunately my order of uni, salmon roe, and toro came was quiet fresh, and every time my order came with a complimentary maki roll. A nice touch and an honest attempt at serving up good Japanese food! If you're a massive foodie like me this place is a great pick even for take out."}
{"text":"I ordered this as delivery from just eat. It came fast. The portions were large. The Udon noodle soup (I was sick) hit the spot and the rolls were decent. They threw in free edamame which was nice. I'll order from here again."}
{"text":"This is the definition of \"cheap fill you up\" sushi. Simon sushi is a great place if you're on a budget and want the most bang for your dollar. Hell, they even give you free edamame with a sample sushi to start! 

Domestic beer here is cheap (under 4 dollars) and basically everything on the menu tastes good, and if it doesnt, you're in the wrong place for what you want (cheap sushi). The addition of ramen noodles is good too. On a few occasions I've ordered the sushi boat for me and 2 other friends and we've been really full while leaving a few bits of sushi left. 

Friendly staff (unless it's really busy, they can be scrambled) and Simon is usually rolling the sushi for everyone. 

This is my go to spot for cheap sushi, leave your high needs at the door."}
{"text":"I guess I have to thank Dany Sushi for being closed all last week, I don't know if I would have walked the extra half block to go into Simon Sushi otherwise. Such a nice little place! Our server told us they opened in July, you can tell everything is new and pretty. 
I went there for dinner with a co-worker last Thursday night. It was not busy, probably 2 other tables had people - but then, I don't think there's more than 10 tables. We did notice a few people coming in to pick up an order for takeout.
The portions may be on the smaller size but the prices are cheap! The most expensive roll is probably $8. 
The food was very good, especially with what you're paying... I had an appetizer (veg tempura) and a roll (no drink, just water) and it came to $14.60 with tax.
I will definitely be coming back!"}
