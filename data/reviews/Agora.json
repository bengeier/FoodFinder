{"text":"I really really wanted to give a higher rating and maybe I will when I try more items...but it's a 3 for now.

When I first heard this place was opening I had to get there as soon as I could! New Greek bakery?! I'm there! I may not be Greek but I know good Greek food. My boyfriend is Greek and I've been to Greece 3 times in the past 5 years. So I know a thing or two.

I was so excited to try the bougatsa because it's my fave Greek pastry. Unfortunately, I was really disappointed with Agora's version. For some reason, perhaps for innovative reasons? They use rose water in their bougatsa. Whyyyyy?? I literally could not finish it because it tasted like face products. Ladies (and gents), you know Mario Badescu's rose water toner? YES. It tastes exactly like that. The taste is so strong, it was nothing like a traditional bougatsa. Don't get me wrong, others might like this. Like maybe those that like rose flavoured macarons. However, I like my bougatsa traditional. I do have to say that the phyllo pastry was so buttery and melt in your mouth. It was so fresh tasting but then I would have the after taste of the rose water and all those buttery dreams would disappear. 

I had a bite of the baklava and it was pretty decent. I couldn't eat more than a bite cuz I was stuffed but it was hella honey soaked. Which leads me to my next issue. They defs need to get some plastic boxes or any box so they can package the baklava better. It was so soaked in honey that a pile of honey was building up at the bottom of the bag. You can see how this is an issue. It's sticky and wet and hard to deal with. Perhaps something to think about.

I didn't have any of the koulouri but my boyfriend and his brother did. It's his brother's fave and I can't tell you how many times he picks one up from the street vendors when we are in Greece. I asked them how they were and if it was comparable. They said these were a bit softer and they preferred it more crunchy like the ones the street vendors sell. I can see how these are more softer as they're fresher.

That was all I got for this trip but I hope to try more of their \"hot foods\" next time. Specifically the moussaka and tiropita. Oh and the loukoumades! So yes, there will be a next time!"}
{"text":"So delicious - we got some tzatziki, prepared chicken breast, freshly made pita, potato salad, cucumber and tomato Greek salad, spanokopita and baklava. I'm going to eat the spanokopita tomorrow for lunch so I can't comment on that yet, but everything else was fantastic. Simply made and wonderful tzatziki, refreshing and creamy. The tzatziki has a lovely more dense texture than other tzatziki's I've tried because it uses pressed yogurt. The chicken breast was so flavorful and moist, really excellently made. The pita is light and fluffy, feels like you have your own delicious clouds in a bag. Potato salad was creamy and delicious as well, has capers in it that give flavor and a bit of crunch. The TOMATOES in hat SALAD were HEAVEN! The BEST tomatoes I've had in a long time, good crumbly feta - so fresh. Baklava packed with flavor, normally I'm not a fan of this often too sweet dessert but they've done something to it to make it not so sickly sweet and more of a flavorful experience rather than loads of sugar in pastry. Well done to the team who is making this place a Mediterranean dream. 

Will be coming back to try lotsssss of tasty things I had my eye on."}
