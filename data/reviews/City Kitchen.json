{"text":"We were there for a little celebration with my three friends, I got a grilled salmon which was perfectly cooked and so good.  My two friends had pasta primavera one was with chicken. My another friend had the CN Tower burger which was full stuffed, tasty and incredible looking. it was really big that's why we all tasted it 
I also tried eggs benedict last week.  It was very creamy, cheesy and delicious. 
So they have friendly staff, good food and also they are close my workplace and this is one of my favorite places in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Very nice looking place with good atmosphere. The food was great... the CN Tower burger is ridiculous but awesome. However, I found that everything on the menu seemed a bit too pricey. Overall, the place feels like a kind of classy take on home style cooking. I'll likely visit again!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome ! 

Came here with a friend after a night of walking around Nuit Blanche. Service was very friendly and food was also very good ! Had the CN Tower burger which was great and orders several drinks which the cute little bartender brought very quick ! 

I work in the area and would definitely be back again. Anyone wanting to give it try shouldn't hesitate."}
{"text":"Ordered country breakfast from here, your classic eggs, bacon, hashbrown fries, toast and coffee. Food was fine, place was clean, service was good."}
{"text":"I was disappointed to see eggspectations had closed the Eaton Centre location.  In its place is the city kitchen.  The place looks he same but has had a bland makeover which is a hint to the food.  Frozen potatoes, Luke warm sides.

In the plus side the service was fast and friendly hopefully the food improves"}
{"text":"City Kitchen was pretty disappointing. We went in for a beer and lunch after a morning of shopping and were not impressed.
The food was unmemorable, but the beer was flat. We watched the bartender and maintenance guy (?) pour two entire glasses of head, before serving them. When we complained, they tried again. Same result. They tried different beers, same result. Very obviously a regulator issue, but wouldn't take my husband's advice (who is a bartender turned engineer) as to the issue, so we ended up beer-less. Not  sure why they couldn't give us something bottled.
Long story short, will not return."}
{"text":"Coffee surprisingly bad. Food decent. Ambiance lacking.   I wouldn't come here again, but if you're standing right in front of it and you're pretty hungry, go ahead ..."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Sunday morning after Fran's and the Senator had way too long line-ups.  Pro was that they weren't busy and we were seated right away. However we still waited almost an hour before receiving our food.

I had an omelette, which was very meh but I can't really complain. Homefries are clearly thrown in the deep-frier from a frozen processed package and are not good. The bigger problem was my sister's eggs, which she ordered over-easy; they looked like they were on the pan for 30 seconds and were essentially raw and very watery inside. And my mom had the BLT, which was cold and seemed like it had been sitting out for the hour we waited for the food. We told our waitress the food wasn't to our satisfaction but didn't send it back, as we were in a rush. Still, my sister didn't touch her plate of uncooked eggs and we were fully charged for it. I think if a meal is clearly inedible and the customer did not eat it, that's a bit ballsy of them to charge. 

Next time we will wait in line somewhere for a decent brunch."}
{"text":"The service was pretty good. Very nice server, and the atmosphere was pleasant. Jalape√±o poppers weren't worth it though. Would not recommend them. But everything else was great. Had the Mexican burger. Warning: the burgers are massive."}
{"text":"Wow I have no words... I feel like you (Jerry P) should watch Kitchen Nightmares and read all of the follow up after the Amy's Baking Company episode.  Way to treat customers. Your manger took my iPhone out of my sight so I have NO IDEA what he did when he took it. I have a screen grab of the valid coupon taken on that day.  You called me a liar more than once to my face, and now in writing.  You brought your wife and daughter to our table for some unknown reason. Your wife then proceeded to become involved in the situation for again some unknown reason.  I did not mention your name calling and behavior in my original review.  I kept it short sweet and 100% true. Attacking customers on social media for your Mis steps is never a good look.  So everyone reading reviews have a look at Jerry the owners response to me and see how he treats his clients.  

Facts to note 1) before we sat down we made sure we could use the Entertainment app.

2) we again verified with the server before ordering

3) the manager tapped the redeem coupon on my phone. I have a screen cap of the coupon that says it is valid for 5 mins from when it was redeemed

4) the manager walked away out of my sight with my iPhone (with passcode lock disabled)

5) the manager could not figure out how to redeem the coupon in a timely manor. There is a 10 min time limit. 

6) the manager and the owner proceeded to accuse me of playing silly buggers despite the fact the manger is the one who tapped to redeem the coupon, and I have photographic evidence of that.

7) the owner and his wife proceeded to accuse me of being a liar more than once. 

8) if you read the follow ups to my reviews you will see that in both other coupon cases the business owners accepted that errors were made and apologized. Both offered to make up for the incidents, neither of which I have taken up on their offers. 

9) the owner shows exactly what I am speaking about with regard to his attitude in his response to me.

Bottom line the food and service are 100% not worth the cost."}
{"text":"Had eggs over easy, that were a little overlooked. The toast came about 5 minutes before the rest of the meal and was cold, but was at least not pre-buttered. The sausages were good and not greasy like you find in a lot of diners. The pancakes were good, but a little on the cool side. The french toast was good, but again, a little cold. My wife had a similar breakfast, except hers came with crepes hat were a little rubbery. Overall, not a bad place, but not a great place. On a plus the staff was courteous and friendly and quick with the coffee refills."}
{"text":"Came here with a few people from work for a nice Christmas brunch last Friday. We usually go to Cora's but decided to switch it up this time and try something new. I have to say it is a pretty big space but it wasn't too busy. Our server was very nice and was always refilling our coffees. 

I opted for the Crepe Mexicano with a salad which was pretty big and filled with lots of chicken and peppers. I would get it again, but I did think it needed some sort of sauce or maybe sour cream on top. The other orders were: 
The smoked salmon benny with sweet potato fries which was just average
The lenny benny with home fries which she really enjoyed and
The steak and eggs which was underwhelming and came with some very dry and overcooked scrambled eggs that he had to send back.

We weren't too impressed or wowed by anything so we decided we would rather stick with Cora's as our go to place."}
{"text":"It was so good that we returned 3 times for Breakfast during our Vacation. The servers were just more than great and made us feel more than welcome. Atmosphere is quiet and lets you enjoy your Breakfast. Highly recommend the Eggs Benedict. Had the Chicken Benny as well as the Montreal Meat Benny. The potatoes that come with it are just awesome. The Crepe Mexicano looked delicious. Definitely will be back next time we visit Toronto. Thanks a lot!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! Saw it while walking somewhere else and decided to chance it! Food is good, service is great, and the hostess is the most adorable little girl (I'm assuming she's the owners daughter?) So helpful, her parents should be proud. This place deserves way more than two stars."}
{"text":"Just tried this place on my latest visit to TO. We stopped in for breakfast on a Sunday. Service was a bit slow but very friendly. The food seemed a bit pricy though I couldn't complain about the quality.  It's an ok spot. I'm a fan of the place just down the street so I'll probably end up back here if the wait is too long at that other place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with a buddy of mine and both times it didn't really seem that busy. The first time I got the Eggs Benedict and a smoothie and the second time I got the 10oz NY striploin with green tea. 

The first time I went was great. The Eggs Benedict was absolutely delicious and the smoothie was okay too (you could really only taste the orange juice with a hint of the other stuff). The service was fast and friendly. This encouraged me to come back for a second time. 

The second time however wasn't so great. Came here for dinner and got the steak medium rare. The steak itself was a bit tough and felt like it was closer to rare than medium rare. I added the peppercorn gravy with mushroom for an additional $2-3 and was rather disappointed with the gravy. I could only describe it as barbecue sauce with a bit of extra kick to it. The service was great again though."}
{"text":"So my friend and I stumbled across this place shortly after arriving in Toronto, we were both hungry so we decided to give this place a try.
Conveniently located on one of the busiest streets uptown, right next to the Eaton shopping mall to be exact, this restaurant attracts a wide variety of customers. 

Before being seated we asked to look at the menu so that we could ensure that we were both happy with the food options before being seated. After a few minutes we decided to give it a try and were seated immediately.

When the waiter came across to take our drinks order I asked what beers he would recommend as I was interested in trying something  local. He gave me a few examples and recommended a lighter one more suitable for lunch. 

Both my friend and I ordered the chicken and avocado burger which was refreshing and extremely tasty. I must admit that I'd only ever had avocado in guacamole so I was pleasantly surprised at how well it fitted with chicken and salad. 

I would recommend this place to anyone in the area. The staff are friendly and keen to suggest options for you and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to watch the world cup and noticed the sign saying they were showing it and had some drink specials. I had been wanting to try this place out since I first saw it open and so we thought why not? 

We ordered two 2oz bar rail drinks ($9 each) and then waited for 15 minutes for them to arrive. I could understand if this place was packed but it was far from even being half full. We had also ordered some chicken wings ($10) and chicken piccata ($16) . We asked if it was possible to exchange the 2 sides that would come with the piccata for a caesar salad. We were told that wouldn't be an issue and there would be no extra charge for it. 

The food came out fairly quickly but you could clearly tell there was a reason that it came out that fast. We received 7 small chicken wings with a few carrot and celery sticks. The wings were rather dry and flavourless. As for the chicken piccata, 
you could taste that it was a frozen chicken breast and there was no sauce on it at all, as if it had been patted dry with a towel before hitting the plate. The exchange of the sides for the caesar salad was also a mistake. A small bowl barely filled with romaine, wonder bread croutons, and very little dressing. 

The service was alright but for the amount of staff that they had on that day, you would think it would have been better. Our server was very nice but when our drinks ran dry we were never asked if we would like another one or anything else for that matter.

Our bill totaled $50 and we left feeling hungry, underwhelmed and disappointed. We won't be going back there anytime soon. 


TL;DR: Good if you're going to grab a quick pint/drink special. But do yourself a favour and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"While City Kitchen had outstanding, very friendly, efficient service from the manager and our server, the food just isn't very good, I'm sorry to say.  We had Nachos - they were not tasty.  The Veggie Burger appeared to have been frozen and was gigantic but with no flavor.  The pasta had too much sauce.  Not good."}
{"text":"The CN tower burger is a mammoth of a burger to finish, buy I do recommend it if you like a challenge. What I enjoy most about this place is the desserts, with two of my favourites being the tiramisu and the chocolate falls. Would keep coming back just for those.
Service is good and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Daughter #1 says the Fruit de mer pasta was superb. Daughter #2 loved the quesadilla but didn't care for the copious green bell peppers in it. My mango burger (chicken version) was delicious, and although the sweet potato fries were tasty, they were too greasy for my liking. Our server Anna K. was quite friendly and gave us excellent service."}
{"text":"Came here for Dinner on a Monday night.  The place was nearly empty, so getting a table was very easy.  The waitress was very pleasant, and easily answered questions about the menu.  The menu itself was quite diverse, and almost anyone should be bound to find something to their liking on the menu.  

I got the Ground Chicken Kabobs.  I forget what Jeff got.  I really shouldn't wait weeks to write these reviews.  Anyway, I was happy with mine.  It doesn't rank as the best version of this meal I've had, but it was a nice change that's not on a lot of menus, and was good.  It did take a bit long to get the food.  But, the menu clearly says things are made to order and may take extra time.  So, there was fair warning.  

I assume it was only deserted because Monday's are a slow night.  There was nothing about the quality of the food, the location, or the service that should have resulted in an empty restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is great juicy burgers and love the battered fries the only small issue I find is they charge for soft drink refills."}
