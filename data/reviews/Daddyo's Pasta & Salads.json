{"text":"Great food, great prices, great service and it's ready fast. Bring your own wine for $6 corkage as well which is nice. The owner is very friendly and helpful. You order at the counter and they being you the food. Jerk chicken fettuccine was very good. Good size portions, they have half size portions too. 

They have a deal for tax free Saturdays."}
{"text":"Pretty good pasta!

Made quickly. 

Good for takeout/pick-up.

I like it. And will return. 
Extra meat, for leanness.

Close to UofT --- so good and bad. 
4.5 stars really for what it is."}
{"text":"Delivery was quick. Food was average at best.

I ordered gnocchi with tomato sauce, which tasted somewhat funky. It was still very hot upon arrival."}
{"text":"Here's my first Yelp review ever so I'm hoping you enjoy reading. 

My philosophy on food is that simplicity works. I'd much rather be eating at a laid back place that does a few things exceptionally well with simple ingredients than posh, stuffy places with white linen and table side service. I don't care to put up with uppity waiters nor is my willingness to pay for expensive place settings very high. I think the ability to create exceptional but simple food is amazing.

This is what I think Daddyo's epitomizes. It reminds me of my travels in Asia savoring awesome food crafted with pedestrian ingredients in unreasonably basic, dressed down settings. Where you might be sitting on ugly, red plastic chairs but the portions are honest and generous.

I ordered fusili with a tomato, sausage sauce which as always, was cooked to order. The pasta had a nice chew and the tomato sauce was tangy. I found the sausage cut a bit thin and that detracted from my enjoyment somewhat. But all in all, my Daddyo's experience was reliable, delivered what I expected, and left me full."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Ordered delivery. Two pastas, while one was perfect the other didn't have the chicken for the pasta Alfredo, which was disappointing to say the least. But the flavours of the food were spot on (the tomatoe sauce and sausage pasta was a little bit on the spicier side)."}
{"text":"No-frills, but great prices and the food is fantastically simple and delicious. If you're craving pasta and not a whole lot more, come here. It's exactly what you need."}
{"text":"Ahh how I miss and love daddy o's pasta. I used it eat it several times a week when I went to U of T. Whenever I am in the area I always try to eat here. The pasta is cooked perfectly, lots of interesting flavors, and reasonably priced. The owner and chef who has been there for a long time are soo nice. Loove this place!"}
{"text":"Ate here twice now and was thoroughly disappointed everytime. Sauces are oily and taste like it was poured out of a can, the lasagna was literally microwaved for 5 minutes and the salad wasn't cleaned properly. Save your money. Pay a few more bucks and go to a cleaner, tastier place"}
{"text":"the guys who work here seem to genuinely enjoy the work they're doing, which is cool. it's completely open concept, with the meal being prepared there right in front of you. i'm a fan of their pasta, but i don't really agree with the previous posts claiming the prices to be so excellent...

i only ever got The Original, which i think is the cheapest one, because the rest of the dishes looked pretty pricey to me. in all fairness, i was living on a student's budget at the time, but paying close to $13 for the relatively small amount of pasta one gets in each serving isn't all that excellent imo. but if money isn't such a concern for you, by all means, go... it's good pasta."}
{"text":"Convenient place. If you want a quick stop to grab some food, its great. Plus on Saturdays, its tax free. Don't forget to try their bread with meal its pretty nice!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch after a class. Chicken pasta I had was sumptuous. Ingredients were fresh and cooked amazingly. Flavor was delicious. The restaurant is more of cafeteria. You walk up to counter and order your food, and server brings it to your table. It doesn't take too long to get your food."}
{"text":"I went there a few days ago and I can confidently say I'm satisfied. The location is convenient for anyone studying at Robarts library or anywhere on the UofT campus. The exterior is simple with a decent seating arrangement inside. The service was pleasant by the cook/cashier and was very quick. I felt very welcomed.

 I ordered the original spaghetti with their signature sauce. The spaghetti was cooked well and the sauce had all the rudimentary ingredients you would expect from a competent tomato sauce with chunks of tomato and garlic sprinkled in. 

Check out the photos for an idea!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a bite between classes. The owner is really friendly and the food is often very good. I get the tetrazini every time I go in and I highly recommend it. Dipping the freshly baked baguette into the sauce afterwards is my favorite part. 

The only reason it's 4 instead of 5 stars is because sometimes when it's really busy, the noodles turn out a little undercooked."}
{"text":"Good pasta, good prices, and close to UofT. What more can you ask for? :)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick, cheap, and delicious lunch for under $10, this is the place, especially if you're on the UofT campus. I had it for lunch today but have been a handful of times already, and I always leave there happy and full. The ingredients are fresh and they don't skimp. I also like that they offer half portions of pasta because I can't get into too much carbs so early in the day and still be functional.

The guys who work here are really nice and accommodating, and Daddy-O too is a friendly guy. The place is small but there is a good number of tables and it does get busy at lunch but no need to fret as the turnover is high due to the speed of the service.

I have only had the pastas (both red: tetrazzini, and white: carbonara) which were very good, but I'm sure their salads are as fresh and bountiful. There are maybe five types of pasta to choose from and endless sauces. The menu is quite extensive for a place this small and busy but that's a good thing, unless you're a really indecisive person. Either way, there are options for vegetarians and meat-lovers alike. I can't remember what else they have on the menu but I'm sure it's available on their website. Anyway, do check it out!"}
{"text":"I usually go here every 3 4 weeks just for the pasta. It's so good. Try out the soup or mussels. Chef and everyone else are nice and friendly. Prices are reasonable"}
{"text":"Awesome food for its price! Went here with some friends yesterday night and the owner was super friendly. I got a full sized fries and a full size pasta and the order only came up to be 15.80! What a great deal. Usually pasta places charge 18-19 just for a bowl of pasta. The ambiance of the restaurant is super chill, kind of like a pizza store around the corner type of feel. Not a fancy and formal restaurant or anything, but I think it would be great for dates and chilling with friends! 

Try not to sit by the door because it was -8 outside yesterday and I could feel my pasta getting cold just after 2-3 minutes.... 
But the overall experience was great!"}
{"text":"Really good pasta dishes at a very reasonable cost.  
Kinda self service, you get the menu, order at the counter and they serve you.  
Sauces are very good, should add a little olive oil to them but still good.  
The chocolate brownie is the best thing in the place.
If in Toronto near Bloor and Spadina, go here for lunch or dinner.
Only place we went to twice on our visit."}
{"text":"The store is conveniently located near the Athletic Centre and Robarts Library at the University of Toronto.
I went on a Saturday noon for take-out. Service was incredibly fast. I was the only customer, and I got my food in less than two minutes after ordering it - fantastic!
The portion was pretty good. I was super hungry that day after an intense tennis session and went for the full-size. I finished the whole thing and felt more than full.
Taste of the bolognese was rich. Although I normally don't eat garlic or anything that has garlic oil in it, I definitely enjoyed it."}
{"text":"A small place on Spadina and a large pasta menu. 

After having listed to my friends go on and on about the pasta here, I finally went to try this oh-so-delicious place. Its a small place and you place the order at the cash counter and have to option of placing a full or half plate order (comes handy since this is a heavy meal). I had the vegetable lasagna but was totally eyeing the shrimp pasta on a strangers plate. 

The lasagna was pretty good but I would love to try the other options as well.

Brown girl says, \"Stranger, why your shrimp pasta smell so good?!\""}
{"text":"Really good straightforward pasta. The shrimp and salmon they used tasted high quality and the pasta and pesto is as good as any other italian joint. Fair price, nice service. I'll bring my friends here."}
{"text":"I walk pass this place almost daily on my way to class, or to Robarts, and I never thought to go in until today. It doesn't look like the most legit from the outside, but when hungry strikes, you follow your belly. 

Upon entering you are greeted by the friendly staff, and you choose what you want and order/pay at the counter. We got the Chicken Pesto pasta, and the Alfredo, both in the full size. If you aren't famished, you'll probably be all filled up with the half size or sharing a full size between two people. The flavours were really good, and the pesto was more on the oily side. It wasn't like any pesto I've had before, but I definitely really liked it. Everything tasted really fresh and bold. It was a good value for the portions and the flavours, and definitely works if you're craving something hearty that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday. Its a great deal as its tax free on Saturdays. The food was great the only suggestion I have is use less oil. Everything else was perfect!"}
{"text":"My first time here.  I didn't understand the drill at first.  And didn't add tip to my payment. Now I realize it's half self serve and half full!  The cash/order taker is very friendly.  Bread fresh. Oil a bit weak but I did get back from Italy just last week so I'm probably an unfair judge. Pasta is perfectly al dente. Cajun chicken sauce delicious.  Good sized half order portions. I will definitely return.  They also sell by the tray.  Will try that when entertaining.  Overall very good."}
{"text":"Not bad at all, 3.5/5 overall. I went to Daddyo's after walking by it a bunch of times and seeing it on a BlogTO article of places to eat around the black hole of food that is the U of T campus. Wasn't exactly sure how it worked at first but quickly saw people ordering their food at the counter and sitting down to wait for their food to arrive. It's a small place so finding a table around noon is a bit like entering the hunger games - restaurant edition. I didn't leave anything at the table I had chosen to mark my territory so while I was ordering my food at least 2-3 groups started to sit down there but the owner was nice enough to tell them I had taken that table already! I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, it arrived within five minutes and it was about what I expected. Personally, I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to marinara sauce (more tomato, less herbs and spices) and this was full of herbs so I might order something else next time but objectively, it was definitely tasty. The pasta was perfectly cooked as well, just a little al dente. The portions were a little small for what you pay considering the setup (ie: no waiters) and the fact that I had heard this place was supposed to be cheap for students.

Pros:
Quick service
Friendly owner
Tasty
Cool that you can choose the type of noodle for your dish

Cons:
Not as cheap as one might think considering portion size and the fact that there are no real waiters. Pretty much average prices.

Wouldn't rush back here but would be open to going again."}
{"text":"I usually visit Daddyo's after working out at the AC nearby and it's always satisfied my hunger. Their pastas are great, served hot, and their staff are always cheery and friendly. It's a bonus that they usually show Blue Jays or Raptors games too.

Their bread could use some work and some pastas could use some more seasoning but overall, I'm usually satisfied when I leave."}
{"text":"Great place! My fiancée and I went earlier this year and it was great. You order your food at the counter and it can be brought to you wherever you decide to sit. It's amazing. We both slurped up our dishes fast! Absolutely great pasta and absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff. Not good food.
I'm sad to say it- I don't know if i was here on an off day but I feel like that one experience will ensure I never go back.
The salad and pasta we ordered was just...bad.  Like everything about it tasted homemade but not in the good way.
It was like a bad version with sub-par ingredients that you go to a friend with a huge OSAP loan's house to have.
yeah...

the staff are genuine, polite and just sweet people.  But the food....pass."}
{"text":"One of the best eats near campus.  The pasta is fresh and made to order and there are so many options.  A half portion will definitely be enough for lunch.  Daddyo himself is a complete muffin and makes the experience even more enjoyable.  He will always remember you if you're a regular, and probably remember you even if you are not.  I've never had a bad experience here and the price and quality is a rare and good combination!  Especially for poor students!"}
{"text":"As a U of T student, I've walked by this place dozens of times, but only today did I actually go in. I'm glad I did. Inside is simple and cozy, the guy behind the counter (owner?) is friendly, and the place has a diner sort of feel about it. The menu was surprisingly vast for a \"fast food\" resto. Prices are reasonable. 

I ordered penne pasta with spicy Italian sausage. It sure was spicy! The portion about right for the $8.99 price -- it left me full and satisfied. I really loved how the pasta wasn't pre-made or anything. The cook would actually toss your pasta in a pan and add the sauce and all, so it felt like a pretty REAL plate of pasta! 

I'm Italian, so I'm accustomed to really great pasta. I won't say my lunch here could compete with my mom's pasta, but I still enjoyed it. I'll probably be back here. It's a good option for U of T students who are tired of the nasty/overpriced Aramark cafeteria-quality food all over campus!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Alfredo fettuccine was amazing."}
{"text":"You get a lot in terms of quality and quantity for what you pay for here.  Jeffrey (the \"DaddyO\" behind the counter) is full of energy and makes you feel very welcome as soon as you step in. 

They have a daily special (outside the listed menu items) that has an interesting mix of ingredients as well. Saturdays are also \"tax free Saturdays\". Garlic bread is also a must try and they have a massive helping of ice cream on top of a brownie if you still have any room left after the meal. 

My favourites are the italian sausage, tettrazini, jerk chicken and the classic spaghetti and meatballs.  Their seafood options are good as well, non-pasta options are homemade lasagna (meat and vegetarian)."}
{"text":"Great staff, great food, great atmosphere. 

What else needs to be said?

A little more expensive than most cafeteria style places but rightfully so, it always tastes great and is ready in minutes. 

I attend often, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Daddyo's is a small, comfortable place that, as it's name suggests, specializes in pasta. You place your order at the front and pretty soon the very friendly staff bring it out to you. The friendliness of the staff at Daddyo's is definitely a draw as it almost always ensures a pleasant experience.

There are a variety of choices on the menu but my personal favorite is the pesto. An aspect I like is that you can choose the style of pasta to go with the sauce you want.

What prevents me from giving Daddyo's five stars however is that I often find the portions to be too small. Maybe I just have a big appetite but I often find myself wanting more. Regardless Daddyo's has some pretty good pasta and a very friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good portion sizes for a good price. I went in between classes so it wasn't very busy. Great service. I got the fettuccine Alfredo. If i was every around and needed something to eat quickly, I'd for sure head back. Very casual place too."}
{"text":"Delicious home-made style pasta, but slightly greasy. A bit overpriced since they charge more than a typical sit-in restaurant would.  We were a bit confused as to how the seating worked since it's half self-serve and half full service. (Though the owner did somewhat explain that to us. He is very open and friendly, but loud. We thought he had too much wine at work the first time we visited, but we realized that was simply his personality when we came back).  The jerk chicken is highly recommended.  Their white sauce is really yummy as well. The soup of the day that we had, corn chowder, is soupy but very creamy in taste with a lot of corn. Oh, and don't forget to get the bread with magic oil!"}
{"text":"I was struck by a major carb-craving last week and needed to find some cheap pasta that didn't involve me cooking it myself. I hit up Yelp and read the reviews for Daddyo's and it sounded about right. I'd noticed it from the Spadina street car several times previously but never remembered the mental note to check it out.

I was a little surprised by the interior, it has sort of a cafeteria vibe, but then after the second of initial shock I remembered that was actually exactly what I was looking for. Quick and simple. 

I sat at a table to review the menu and the guy behind the counter yelled at me to come up and order when I was ready. I wasn't really one to be yelled at in a crowded restaurant so that kind of put me off, but I stuck it out despite the brief urge to walk out (I think I'm over the problem with yelling servers now anyway since being to Guu this week haha).

I decided on penne alfredo with chicken and bread. It took two minutes to get the food. The pasta was cooked properly. The sauce was pretty much what I make at home so it was good but not gourmet. It could have done with a little garlic and it was definitely under-seasoned but nothing a visit from the salt shaker didn't fix. The bread was good. \"Magic oil\" kind of confuses me, back where I come from we always just called it olive oil. There were about five chunks of chicken and that addition cost me about 2.70.

I'm giving this place 4 stars because the food is good for what it is. If you avoid the over-priced chicken addition you would be left with a large plate of filling and ok tasting pasta for like $7. It's not gourmet, but it doesn't pretend to be. Perfectly acceptable for a cheap weeknight dinner. Also Saturdays are tax free so a good place for a weekend meal too if you aren't trying to impress anyone. I'll go back."}
{"text":"Called to place an order since its website says delivery, and even encourages people to call outside of its delivery area (not specified). We live east of Ossington on Harbord ... not far. The guy who answered had a dismissive tone, didn't know where Ossington was, and then after checking, asked for the address again before pronouncing us too far. Meh. Was looking forward to trying out the food and delivery service, but no thanks now."}
{"text":"A nice restaurant/fast food blend type place. The more plain selections on the menu taste a bit bland, but the specialty pastas are excellent! I recommend the Jerk Chicken. The price is a bit high for a place that doesn't have full service."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast, cheap food just steps from UofT? Count me in! After having dined on convenience store sandwiches every day on campus for weeks on end, I was looking for something for lunch that would be fresh and soul-warming, but wouldn't break the bank. DaddyO was definitely it. 

First off, the proprietor (DaddyO himself?) was super-friendly and nice. He was great about answering the myriad questions about the menu that I and my dining companions had. I also love that they offer half-portions, which is just the right amount of food to fill me up but not so bloated that I would have needed to request a ride back to school in a wheelbarrow. I had the Tettrazini with whole wheat spaghetti (y'know, so it's healthy). The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, and the sauce creamy without being too rich. Best yet, the food came out fast, and my dining companions and I were in and out of there in less than an hour. My half portion of pasta, can of soda, and side order of bread with \"magic oil\" (olive oil with herbs and whatnot) came out to about $10. Not a bad deal, and I was perfectly satiated 'till well past dinnertime. 

Ambience is pretty basic: plastic chairs, cheap tables, paper napkins. Fine dining it ain't. But if you're looking for a decent lunch, can't bear another crap campus meal, and are on a budget, DaddyO's is where it's at."}
{"text":"Very convenient location as it is within walking distance from Robarts. I love how they offer special deals for students! The staff are very friendly and you receive your orders relatively quickly. The food is pretty good and affordable."}
{"text":"I lived at innis in my first year of undergrad but never has a chance to try this place. Today another friend recommended this place to me again so I decided to try for dinner! 

Ambiance: very cute little cafe, great for dates. No server--seat yourself and, when you're ready to order, go to the counter and order. The server there was super nice and welcoming and remembers where you're sitting. Grab cutlery and water yourself--just like at nandos. 

Food: I got the pescatore with fettuccine, shrimps, and salmon. It came in less than 5 minutes. There were four shrimps but just a teeny tiny slice of salmon; it was cold, as well, unlike the rest of the dish, which I found odd. The noodles were delicious and so was the shrimp, however for $15 after tax I was expecting a bigger portion. 

Final verdict: will come back again, but will probably order one of the common items and hope for bigger portions."}
{"text":"Food here was decent, but I don't think it's deserving of all the glowing reviews. I might be a little biased coming from an Italian background, but I don't think there's anything special.

Everything was prepared quickly and the staff was friendly. But the menu is quite boring and the food didn't really leave me satisfied. In fact, I might just head to the kitchen and cook up some more right now.

Still, if you're looking for reasonably priced Italian fare near U of T, Daddyo's is definitely worth a look."}
{"text":"Great place, great pasta and super friendly service. The food was very tasty and they have tax free day every Saturday! Check it out."}
{"text":"Cute little Italian restaurant conveniently located near UofT. This is a great place to grab a quick meal, as the food is usually ready within 10 minutes or less. Also the owner is very friendly and welcoming.

I recommend the jerk chicken with penne pasta. You can't go wrong with the pasta dishes here. The only thing I'd advise against is the garlic bread with cheese. It was literally just a piece of pita bread with baked cheddar cheese on top, it looked exactly like something I could make at home lol"}
{"text":"Came here when I was studying at Robarts and it has decent reviews. The owner is very friendly and food came pretty fast. You pay at the counter when you order, so technically you don't need to give any tip, but I did anyway. Water is self serve on the side, so are utensils and napkins.

I ordered a half portion Pescatore. I really like white sauce and Parmesan, so that part was good. I found the sauce a bit too oily (had leftover oil with the sauce at the end), and fettuccine seems thinner than most places I've been (But I'm not Italian, so what do I know?). Portion is just enough for me, not stuffed but not hungry. I can imagine guys will need full portion. 

I'm not sure if the price is as great as the other reviews put it...maybe it's because I got the bread ($1) and tipped, ended up with $11. I've had cheaper pasta with bigger portion, but this is cheap comparing to most Italian/high end restaurants.

I would come back if I'm nearby and need a quick bite that won't cause food coma."}
{"text":"The food here is tasty, prepared quickly, and reasonably priced.  One of my favorite things is that they're always willing to make dishes vegetarian, including the jerk chicken pasta (in fact, the vegetarian jerk chicken is one of my favorite dishes).  The arrabbiata sauce is my other go-to dish, although it is very spicy so it may not be for everyone (they'll usually warn you when you try and order it for the first time).  The other main draw of this place for me is that they have the friendliest staff I've encountered in Toronto."}
{"text":"Used to be one of my favourite places, it was always great bang for your buck. 

I know the cheap dollar has been hurting everyone but you  can really feel both the quality and the quantity has been declining for some time. It's a shame since this was a fantastic place for students in the past. You can really taste their in-house outsourcing in the kitchen as well. 

Sub par quality, not a lot of food at normal downtown prices."}
{"text":"Perfectly acceptable lunchtime pasta joint.  I had a bolognese pasta which was a solid, if a bit uninspired fettuccine bolognese.  It appears to be cook to order.  I had trouble deciding as the half-order is a bit small, and the full order was both a bit large and a bit expensive for lunch.  The best thing was the olive oil and herb dip that came as a $1 add-on to the meal.  Of course, I would kind of expect a piece of bread for free with the price of the pasta.

I've never felt quite so awkward service-wise though.  We were told to sit down when we came in, but then we were told we had to come up to the counter to order.  I'm Meena K, it was all a bit confusing as to a hybrid of table service and counter service.  The staff were a bit aggressive with the customers, including rather rudely ordering someone to close the door who didn't quite get it shut all the way.  

Overall, acceptable, uninspired, standard, Italian fare, close to campus."}
{"text":"Their half size bowl is really not filling in the slightest... And this is coming from someone who usually doesn't eat a lot. 

Sadly, the troubles don't end there. The tomato sauce in the Baby Clams pasta was really watery. However, the Pescatore was good. 

Overall, a decent spot if you're craving pasta on campus -- just get ready for a complete lack ofatmosphere."}
{"text":"While I really like this place, it sometimes depends on who's making your food. Today I got an order of Alfredo and a half salad, bocconcini and tomato. While I don't think a half salad for 7 dollars should only half three small pieces of cheese, I have to say the flavour was still really great. Alfredo flavour was good as well but it was much runnier than usual. Make sure to get the fresh baked bread. I would probably just go there and spend two dollars to get some bread and oil that stuff is so good."}
{"text":"Was dragged here and forced to finish the remainder of a rather large and decent shrimp pasta. Super-efficient."}
{"text":"the magic bread (baguette with seasoned olive oil) and anything alfredo is sooo good."}
{"text":"Daddyo's is a little gem near the University of Toronto that my friend introduced to me after some hardcore studying at Robarts'. I must say that the exterior of this place is deceiving. It isn't as fancy as any of the other restaurants that I've tried here in Toronto, but I was surprised by the quality of the food!

Everything I've ever gotten here has been spectacularly made. A lot of pasta places I've been to give me the \"why did I come here, I could have made this myself\" feel to it. Nothing special or different. But Daddyo's is great, full of flavour and the pricing is fair.

It is even great for a light snack as they have a half portion option if you're not feeling particularly hungry. Definitely affordable and I will be returning!

I had the spaghetti pasta with Bolognese sauce."}
{"text":"Tonight was the night my partner and I decided to go here. It was okay. He says he would give it a rating of 3 out of 10, so a 2 out of 5 star rating is generous. 

Seats are taken as per what seats are available, and of your choosing. Orders are placed at the counter. Our orders were the spicy Italian Sausage Penne (full), Caesar Salad (half), a West Coast Salad (half), Tettrazini penne (half). Plus the $.99 1/4 of baguette with olive oil and spices. Thats actually expensive if you think about it in relation to a full size baguette one can buy at the grocery store, for the same price. 

The salads were cheap quality....the \"fresh greens\" in the West Coast Salad equated to the cores of Romain lettuce leafs, with few leaf component, very little chicken (for the West Coast salad), The Caesar Salad had barely a tablespoon of bacon bits and was more or less the same, not satisfactory. Thankfully we only got the half sizes. 

The pastas: My boyfriend's pasta was essentially the same size as mine and he got the full size, whereas I got the half size. This was extremely disconcerting. He was not happy with how spicy the Italian sausage was. Perhaps rating the heat level of the sausage, on the menu would be a good idea, as some prefer mild spice. I know there are different variants of heat to the Italian favourite. Options here would be great.

My pasta was incredibly flavourful; however, the sauce, was overly salty... My main qualm was the chicken.... on the menu it says \"Chicken Breast\". When I see and read \"Chicken Breast\" on a menu it usually implies there will be a large quantity of chicken and there was not. Disappointing. 

The man who greeted us was friendly and welcoming, thats a plus. 

Paying over $30 for a meal that was lacking in areas was unfortunate. First time here so... one lives and one learns. We certainly have."}
{"text":"It's good, it's close to the University of Toronto but it's not cheap!

It's a restaurant adapted to the fast-pace student life. The flow has a much more fast food feel to it. Menus at every table, orders taken upfront at the counter and orders brought out when they call your number. Grab your own cutlery but leave your dishes on the table when done! I found it very confusing and would've preferred it if they kept a more familiar fast

$0.99 for bread is a good filler, but I wish it would've been included in the price of pasta. The pasta is good, but I found the value in the tetrazini pasta underwhelming. Chicken breast was sparse as were the mushrooms. Cheese tortellini is decently sized and they won't hesitate to give you lots of parmesan if you want!"}
{"text":"I am a UofT student and is always struggling to find a good western food place close to Robarts Library to eat.  Daddyo's is only 5 minutes walk from the back entrance of Robarts. The place is not fancy, you order at the counter and they bring the food to you. I order the half portion Cajun chicken on whole wheat spaghetti (0.59 extra charge for half, 0.99 for full) it came to exactly $8 (saved on tips since it was order at counter and they didn't serve water or anything) 

It was quite empty on a Thursday afternoon around 3 so our pasta came in about 10 minutes. The staff was very friendly as he asked if you wanted to add Parmesan and freshly grounded pepper. I added both, which made the pasta taste better in my opinion. 

At first bite, I thought the tomato sauce was pretty typical but then as I ate more it got better as the Cajun spices did the trick. It was very flavourful combined with the harder/rougher texture of the whole wheat spaghetti. The reason for the 3 stars was the lack of chicken. In total I got 4 pieces max of chicken... I am assuming in the full portion they give you more topping. 

I ended up scraping every bit of spaghetti off my plate because the portion was just enough to fill my stomach (stomach of a petite 5 ft asian girl. Lol I can still eat more but I mean, yeah the portion was acceptable). There was some left over sauce because it was just too flavourful if I ate all of it. 

I will come again mostly because of proximity to the library but also this price is not bad for decent tasting pasta."}
{"text":"Highly reputed but I frankly did not understand what the fuss was about. The portions were tiny and the flavours were way too mild and subtle. Most of the time, I just felt the taste of rubbery, chewy pasta in my mouth and nothing else."}
{"text":"Almost didn't go there the first time as the reviews seemed to suggest it was a student hang-out.  Well, it is that, but it is so much more.  It is a good restaurant. 

How good is Daddyo's? Very good. It's really a 4 1/2 star joint, not a 4.  

The standard Spadina washrooms are what keeps it below a 5.  The stairs down to the washrooms are downright scary. 

But we're going for the food.  Awesome food - best of all is that you can choose the size of your serving for most choices.  I'd be tempted to kill for their wasabi mayo recipe.  The fries are really just a carrier for the wasabi mayo.  Sooooo good. 

I usually go for a half salad and half pasta - and share an order of fries with my regular concert/Daddyo's companion. 

I'm a particular fan of the BLT salad, but none of them have been misfires so far. 

On the pasta side, you choose your pasta shape, your sauce colour (red/white/olive oil), and the number of meatballs you want (if you want meatballs).  Always check out the special - there's often something yum.  I default to the red arrabiata sauce on fettucine if nothing else tempts. 

The chef often has an interesting soup on offer. On those days, it's salad/soup and shared fries!

The staff has been consistently friendly, Daddyo is great to chat with, service is snap snap snappy.

Daddyo's - not just for students!"}
{"text":"I have only been once to date, but I have literally been craving this place since I went. I've tried to go again three times but it's been closed every time I went (too late or a holiday I forgot about). Don't get me wrong- normal enough hours, I'm just all over the place meself.

So, Daddyo's? Brilliant. The penultimate take-out pasta place.
I had tried the meaty Bolognese and got a Tomato+Bocconcini salad. The pasta was rich, thick and packed with juices. Every bite was a pasta god-send and when I finished I swear a tiny tear rolled down my face- I had always wondered about \"that little place between Bloor and Harbord\" and now that I know what I've been missing, I'm salivating to return. The salad was good, but after the pasta, everything pales. They have lots of options for pasta too, so there's something to keep everyone busy.

I was thinking after- all these take-out places are for Burgers, Shwarma, Sandwiches, Crepes, Poutine, Fish & Chips, etc... but I've never really found a PASTA place I've been head over heels for... until now. I love the little patio, but I can't help but think of this place as a great take-out spot (granted, I literally live down the street).

Also of note, the owner is a super-friendly guy and the best part is smelling them make your food."}
{"text":"Everything here is homemade and I have never seen pasta for these prices.
You pick which pasta you want and then you choose a noodle, but the owner is so very friendly and will make any combo you want. I always get the pesto cream sauce with the clams. 
The brownie is a two person deal but you will not regret it. The garlic bread is so-so but I always get it anyway. The plain old tomato sauce changed the way I see tomato sauce forever.. so sweet and so flavourful I have literally never had anything like it. WOW is all I have to say."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here and it was lit. Pasta cooked perfectly and you gotta get some bread to scoop up the amazing sauce"}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious food. My only complaint is the restroom which is downstairs. The way down is very steep and the floor is very slippery so it feels kinda dangerous to go there."}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't find out about this place for 33 straight months while living at Innis Residence... glad I did.

Great place to get a quick and tasty meal - tons of selection and customizability."}
{"text":"It's actually not as good as what the previous reviews said. The food is just mediocre, staff is nice though"}
{"text":"Always loved this place since I go to u of t. It's a flexible menu where you get to pick your portion size as well as your preferred pasta and sauce and it's made deliciously.

The owner is extremely nice and friendly and so are the cooks! I always love coming here it's such a convenient walk from Robarts Library :)"}
{"text":"I go there regularly as its near work. Fast, quality and friendly service. The bruschetta cannot be beaten. Be sure to have it.
Great vegan options. Always a great place to go"}
{"text":"Since my last review I've been coming here A LOT, and I'm up-ing the rating to 5 stars. So far I've tried the Cajun chicken, tettrazini, seafood medley, Italian sausage, and bolognese, along with bruschetta, magic oil bread, and I occasionally add veggies to my pasta for an additional $1.99. My favourite so far is the seafood medley, it's a mixture of pesto and red sauce, and has a variety of seafood and spinach. Very tasty. I also like their Italian sausage, which I don't find to be spicy at all, so I'm not too sure about what the previous reviews were saying about the sausages being very spicy. I find their half-sizes to be quite filling already, especially if you order a starter on the side.

Their bruschetta is a must try. So fresh! On the contrary, I wasn't too crazy about their magic oil bread, even though it's a fan favourite here. Can't wait to come here again and try more options!

The owner and staff are all very friendly. I see them frequently engaging in conversations with customers and they are always smiling and laughing. Would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"I imagine that the lunch hour is when Daddyo's gets the busiest and that is exactly the time I was taken there for a recent lunch date. Despite the jam packed room of hungry students and nearby workers, the cooked-to-order pasta was actually delivered to the table quite soon after we ordered and paid at the counter from Jefferey who is Daddyo himself.

Our saucy pastas arrived steaming hot with the offer of freshly ground black pepper. My white mushroom garlic rotini was served in a smaller portion than I would imagine that another diner would like, but suited my midday appetite just right. My enthusiastic lunch date, who happens to work nearby and frequents Daddyo's has apparently tried almost all of the dishes and sings nothing but praise for them all.

The decor in the bright and high ceilinged, but small dining room is ultra casual with tables that cluster to suit different sized groups. The large windows facing Spadina make people- (in the summer) and streetcar- (in the winter) watching a good distraction if you don't come prepared with a book, colleague, or date of your own."}
{"text":"Daddyo's is a great place to get a great meal at a good price, close to the University of Toronto. 

I love Daddyo's. There is a great environment, great service, and a large (but not overwhelming) menu. 

I usually have the (delicious) Salmon Milanese, but have recently discovered that the daily special is totally the way to go! Not only do you get something different, but it comes with a little slice of french bread to enjoy it with! 

If you're looking for a delicious, quick lunch, Daddyo's is the way to go! (AND they also deliver!)"}
{"text":"Food here is good (not great), but it's inexpensive and served with a huge smile.  Seriously, the guy behind the counter (should we call him \"daddyo?\") makes the visit worthwhile.

Just watch out for the arrabiata sauce; it's very spicy"}
{"text":"The food here is awful! I had the bruschetta and it was the worst I've ever had at a restaurant! Also had pasta and it was horrible sauce. Would not recommend here at all! Avoid!"}
{"text":"Customer service is fantastic! Being so close to the St. George campus I expected there to be an attitude - you're just a poor lowly student, take your food and leave. But no attitude here. I also like that they ask if you want pepper and cheese on it before taking it to go. And the loving way they pack your food up with a fork and napkin (just like mama used to).

The food is freshly prepared and fantastic. I love that the pasta comes al dente and the non-traditional items actually taste good. I've tried the Italian Sausage - it was deliciously spicy, I just wish the sausage pieces were larger but there was a good amount; Cajun Chicken - serious spice on it, loved every bite, very good amount of chicken. Chicken Veggie Pesto was not as filling as I'd hoped but if you want a light lunch definitely get this. 

There's a daily special - try the Southwest Chicken if you have a chance. They don't do half orders for the special but omg, that southwest chicken was AWESOME.

I appreciate that they have 1/2 and full servings, it makes life a lot easier and cuts down on wasting. The only thing I felt that wasn't worth my money was the Tomato and Boccocini Salad, it's nice to have while you're there but I could make the same thing at home for a lot less.

Definitely stopping by tonight before my late class. You definitely cannot go wrong here."}
{"text":"I've only done the delivery option here but I was very impressed.  The guy on the phone was friendly and helpful.  The delivery was exceptionally fast, like the fastest ever. Like the Flash or something.  It was as if I got off the phone, sat down on the sofa, and he called and said he was here.  It was odd.  The food was hot, tasty, fresh and very affordable.  I was very full.  Definitely will be ordering from here in the future."}
{"text":"The pastas were really disappointing in proportion and the flavours were not really doing justice to what the reviews were claiming; atleast to me and my husband."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot when I lived across the street. I recently moved back to the area and revisited this pasta place... and the food is as good as I remember :) The owner and staff are super nice and still recognize me after 4 years! It's not particularly cheap, but you get what you pay for--good portions and good food :)"}
{"text":"I love it so much! It's near to UofT St. George campus so it's perfect for lunch break. A very cozy place to drop in and take a rest. The french stick with magic oil...it's literally magical!!!"}
{"text":"Nice little place by uoft, service 4/5, food 2/5 and decor (open kitchen...  No fresh ingredients) 2.5/5,
Portion size( for price is kinda not worth it but its dt by uoft.... So ) 3/5 

I got the original with the 6 meatballs and a small Caesar salad and a cola, take out, ate 1/2 of it in restaurant. Cost me $18.95 ( $20 for pasta and a salade.... Its not even Boston pizza (probably better than this place tho food wise) )

The staff is all nice and the owner is too. Its a fast food place with mediocre food. 4/5 no female workers... I dunno if the owner is sexist or  its me being observant. (Probably me). The menu is good in that you can choose your type of pasta with the sauce. 

The food however.... 

 Salad only had 4 cruttons on it and very little sauce(the quarter lemon was my flavour for the salad) and the bacon bits were awesome but... Again about a pinch of it $6. God that's pricey ( mcd's does better salades,sadly.)

Pasta, spaghetti with tomato sauce and 6 small probably frozen then boiled store bought meat balls... (I might be expecting too much for a Italian place) anyhow, it was pretty flavorless couldn't tell whether it was pork or beef, too bland. The sauce... Well... The flavour is somewhat there... The sauce is so watery there is no fresh ingredients ... Watered down canned sauce and Oliver oil. Just sad. 

Overall, I was really disappointed, was expecting a nice home feeling Italian place with a flavor, that's not it here, its an Italian fast food place (one that isn't pizza)."}
