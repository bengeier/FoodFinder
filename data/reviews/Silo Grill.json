{"text":"Good quality, prices seem fair, good view of golf course.  Came here for lunch.  They sat everyone in the Victoria Room which is left of the usual restaurant area where service is usually done.  Perhaps there was an event that day?    It didn't really matter, still nice view and great food.  The wait for food took a bit longer than expected.  Staff was busy running around and servicing, very helpful and polite when they did tend to us."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch! Good food at reasonable prices. And great patio view of the golf course. Been here many times for brunch. Highly recommend their breakfast and burgers!"}
{"text":"Worst breakfast I've ever had in my life, it's such a shame because this location is so beautiful, you have a great view no matter what time of the day, the best time is to come at twilight watch the sun go down. The restaurant faces to the west across the beautiful golf course and a lake as well. However the food is unbelievably unbelievably bad. I ordered what was described in the menu as fluffy pancakes, they showed up about a eighth of an inch thick, and solid, not fluffy at all -they were supposed to come with fruit and berries, all I got was one strawberry sliced so thin you could see through it, and about seven blueberries which were hard and dried up and wizened like they were one year old. Really really disgusting. But probably worst of all, I got my disgusting meal, and then more than 20 minutes later my kids breakfast arrived. How difficult is it to serve three plates of breakfast at the same time? There's something really wrong in this kitchen. Then my kids meals were tepid, or room temperature so who knows how long they've been sitting around.And worst of all was the home fries, I was guessing they had been frozen, and I asked the waitress and Sure enough they had been frozen. How difficult is it to cook fresh home fries? Really really horrible. The only good thing about the meal was the nice waitress did make us pay for it."}
{"text":"Very scenic view overlooking the golf course while dining. Surprisingly the food is also reasonably priced and very well prepared. Good staff service as well."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. They have a small menu but a decent variety. Love their food and would definitely come back again for breakfast as well as to try their lunch and high afternoon tea. Great view. Outside seating. The server was very nice and friendly. If you just come for the food and are not used to this golf club environment, you may find it confusing when trying to find the restaurant. It has more of a lounge/bar look."}
{"text":"This golf club is beautiful, lush and green. The Silo restaurant is located right in the middle of it and equipped with a great patio overlooking the golf course. The service is fast and the food is amazing. You really don't need to be good or even interested in golf to dine here on a nice summer day.  Salads were well prepared and better than expected, hummus and pita and pizza was also a hit with everyone. The prices were fair and watching the sun go down while dining in the open air was a great experience.  The only drawback? On a cloudless summer day, the intense sun can get a bit too overwhelming unless you manage to snag a table with an umbrella."}
{"text":"My wife and I married at Angus Glen in 2014. We decided that we wanted to have lunch at the Silo Grill for our one year anniversary. We had a party of 13. The staff were extremely accommodating. Grandma (we call her Baba) is of course older and has mobility issues. Although they had us sitting in a really nice spot on the lower level of the deck, they quickly changed our seating arrangement when we told them that Baba couldn't get down the stairs. We sat instead on the upper deck, in a nicely shaded area. Totally impressive. The view was great. The staff are extremely accommodating, with all types of needs, separate bills, dietary constraints, and allergies just mention a few. I should mention the waitress also walked a far distance carrying all meals and drinks, of course respectively. She did this without even showing a bit of distain. She was a real professional and so very polite. Angus Glen, where this restaurant is, was also the site of the 2015 Panam Golf games.   Getting to the food. It's decent at the Silo Grill. I've had better, but I'm also a bit of a traveller. However the food at our wedding (which is food made on site as well) was phenomenal. Perhaps it was a different chef. Overall I don't think you'll be disappointed if you decide to eat here. I would almost guarantee you'll enjoy the experience overall. The prices are fair also, and the decor is also great.   My wife, our friends, and family will definitely be back to golf, to eat, and to enjoy :)"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Sunday, during the World Junior Girls Championships at Angus Glen. The restaurant was mostly empty both indoors and outdoors, so we had our pick of seating. The outdoor seats have a nice view of the 18th hole of the golf course.  Even though the restaurant is located inside a golf course, I didn't think it was particularly expensive. We ordered the nachos ($12) as an appetizer, line-caught fish and chips (substituted with sweet potato fries) ($18), and the pan-seared salmon ($19). The nachos were a large portion, so we took the remainder home. The fish and chips were really good. The fish was not overcooked, and flaked off. The sweet potato fries were delicious. The salmon was cooked perfectly, and the shitake mushrooms and edamame were tasty.  Afterwards, we walked along the path and watched some golf. All in all, an excellent dining experience."}
