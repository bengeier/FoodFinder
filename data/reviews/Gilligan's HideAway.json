{"text":"This place is amazing every time I go better and better the food is soooooo amazing !!!!!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times for their Saturday Night Prime Rib special.    Gilligans is definitely a Hideaway, and takes a bit of searching to find it.  Their food is good, the service is INCREDIBLY friendly, and the place is always clean.  The drinks are cheap and poured heavy, and the food portions are generous for the price.    It is an older restaurant and is a smoking establishment, so it's great if you are a smoker but for the non-smokers out there, the years of smoke build-up may be a bit too much.  We've been several times, and we will keep coming back.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I went here for the 1st time on Wednesday(checking out bars/resturants in my soon to be new neighborhood)and was very thrilled that I did. Amazing delicious food specials. I ordered chicken nachos: the chips were fresh home made & the tons of chicken on it were right off the bone. AND it only cost 5 bucks! The chef came & talked to us for a bit & I could tell the man clearly loves to cook, I could tell just by tasting his food! If you enjoy home cooked meals, awesome service & cold beer, then check this place out!"}
{"text":"Good food good meat good god let's eat! That's right everything is right with this place. Great staff great service fabulous food and friendly patrons. I would say going there is a must, but I don't want you to take my table!"}
{"text":"Chilled-out, locals style tavern.  Good for bar food and to hang out.  I like it!"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by it's cover! It looks a little sketchy, but go inside! Awesome bar food, respectably priced, fair gaming machines & a great lady bartender that makes you feel like a regular among a bar full of regulars."}
{"text":"Discovered this little gem in my neighborhood. The service is awesome. The staff made me feel so welcomed and seemed to appreciate my patronage. The drinks and food are absolutely delicious and the price point is extremely  reasonable."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times for the amazing Prime Rib Saturday special!!!  My sister had an overnight trip to Las Vegas and we wanted to go somewhere to eat and chat a bit.  She said just a neighborhood type place versus the Strip would be great...Gilligan's was it!  My sister had the special, ribs and chicken and I had the fish and chips, absolutely delicious food and we went home with doggie bags!  And yes, it is a smoking place, however we sit in the back and with the fans on, it is not that bad.  (I'm an ex-smoker and it can bother me) And very friendly staff, always helpful!!!"}
{"text":"Nicest.staff.EVER! Decent bar, good atmosphere, and great food.  We only ordered an appetizer. Mozzarella \"sticks\" more like mozzarella logs. These things were frickin' huge! Definitely not frozen and cut straight  from a fresh piece which you'll never see in a PT's.  Zoe and Matt; incredibly friendly and attentive and are the reason we're going back. The place isn't a dive but it's definitely hidden away. Worth going to if only for a drink, some mozzarella logs, and a football game."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Saturday a few months ago.  Sat in the restaurant area, nobody else in there except for some folks at the bar.  The chef was also our server. Food and service was good, loved the stained glass decor.  Worth checking out! And yes, in case  you were wondering, you can get a Whistle Pig here."}
{"text":"This is my third time into Gilligan's. The first time I had the Frisco burger and the Gilligan fries and the only thing I can say is it was outstanding. The second time I brought my wife and she had the clam chowder and salad on a Friday night and I had the Philly cheese steak sandwich. Both were extraordinary. Today we came back in for lunch I had their pork chop special and my wife had the meatball parmesan sandwich, and I can say they were as good as any we have ever had. This is a bar so if you're looking for casual dining this is your place. If you're looking for formal dining go somewhere else and have much worse food."}
{"text":"Chilled-out, locals style tavern.  Good for bar food and to hang out.  Once my friends and I became regulars, the managers let us have our Game Nights there.  Monopoly Deal for the win!"}
{"text":"ordered food for delivery. i gave 2 stars becuase 'meh. Iv'e had better' it wasnt that bad, delivery time was normal. prices are good. but maybe pizza and chicken fried steak (ate it before i took pic) just isnt what theyre best at.   i was craving chicken fried steak since  i seen it on the menu they left on my door.  i was very satisfied with it. i dont know what it was. maybe a little plain? i dont know. the pizza was the same. just Meh.   im sure i will try them again another day."}
{"text":"Saturday night prime rib....and that about sums it up! Amazing!...but don't wait too long because They often sell out. They also do a really delicious Cobb salad. Plenty of food no matter what you order. I recommend this place for any local and/or any visitor lucky enough to discover it."}
{"text":"I live near here. It's not a bar to be rowdy. It's your neighborhood tavern! The most friendly bartenders you can think of and some delicious food.   The bar has multi games that suck at blackjack but kick ass at every other game. Deuces wild pays like a mother %$#!*&."}
{"text":"Been to nicer places but not with nicer staff. Local type tavern with a reasonably priced  full bar and a surprisingly full menu for a small kitchen. Hand dipped fingers and onion rings were very good. Bartender Michelle ROCKS!"}
{"text":"O-M-G!! I just noticed Gilligan's Hideaway on GrubHub today and I was craving baby back ribs, so I ordered half a rack, jumbo garlic-butter shrimp scampi, and plain chicken fingers with a side of ranch to dip them in.  Let me tell you...I was FAR from disappointed!! The chicken fingers were hot and crispy on the outside with tender, white meat on the inside. They were really good. The garlic-butter shrimp was hot and very flavorful, without being drowned in the garlic-butter sauce. It was just right. As for the ribs... I have absolutely NO COMPLAINTS whatsoever!! They were cooked PERFECTLY, with just the right amount of BBQ sauce. Their baby back ribs were, BY FAR, thee BEST ribs I've ever had. They were fall off the bone tender and had no fat on them at all. They just had LOTS of tender, delicious meat!!  Needless to say, I will DEFINITELY be ordering from them again in the near future!! I HIGHLY recommend you try their baby back ribs.  And last but not least, even the customer service and the delivery time were amazing!!"}
{"text":"This hidden gem is just off Sahara one block east of Eastern Avenue.  Daily lunch and dinner specials, plus a 4 - 6 list of happy hour specials that include oysters, claims as well as the usual bar food.  Today we stopped in for the pork chop dinner, which came with apple sauce, just like Mom used to serve, green beans and a mess of potatoes au gratin.  Home style food is available in Vegas for a most reasonable price.  And even though we don't drink, the long time staff did not ignore us, on the contrary, treated us like welcome members of the family."}
{"text":"I stumbled on this spot while reading an article about the Las Vegas mob. This place used to be called Starboard Tack in the 70s and Al Bramlett the local culinary union leader hired 2 men to plant car bombs here in 1976. The bombs failed to detonate and Mr Bramlett didn't pay for the job. One thing leads to another and Mr Bramlett ends up dead in the desert.  Now on to Gilligans, I really like the decor. The nautical theme is evident outside and inside, a true throw back to the old days where the outside looks like a dock, the inside is made to look like a ship (on restaurant side) etc. They have really cool stained glass art behind the booths. Now my problem is I read the website menu that included things like filet and shrimp for 13.99 and many other enticing items. The problem is when I got there the menu was totally different and about 15-20% more expensive than the website shows. Have to knock off stars for that. I ordered chicken marsala made by the waiter/chef , who looks just like Norm Macdonald and was an awesome guy. The chicken was great and the pasta and garlic bread were plentiful and adequate. The marinara was not great but its not like this is an Italian place. I paid about 20 for my meal and 2 bottles of domestic suds. I will come back for the Saturday prime rib special. Just a note, the location is very very odd. It seems to almost be in an apartment buildings parking lot off a side street in a worn out area of town. Don't let that fool you because this is the type of homey bar/restaurant (with some interesting \"mob\" history) you don't really find in this town anymore (like the Coachmen)."}
{"text":"Let me start with the service. Very kind people and the cook even came out and had great conversation with us. He explained all the popular specials. The food came out pretty fast as well.  The food was the best bar food I've had in a while. I enjoyed the heck out of their pastrami sandwich with spicy mustard on rye bread. The hot wings are to die for also. The prime rib was as good as it gets as far as flavor and texture goes.   The price was unbelievable for the quality you get. The Saturday prime rib special is $16.95, and you get a huge baked potato, salad, dessert, and a choice of wine beer or soda. That's unbeatable!  All in all I'm going back!!!! ASAP"}
{"text":"My hubby is always finding great places in vegas and this is one of them.  Great food and even better prices.  The cook and waitress were amazing. It's small but worth the time to come and check it out."}
{"text":"Glad I found this place!  Service and food was excellent!  Had the Frisco burger with Gilligan's fries and everything was perfect.  Great food, great prices, great service and nice tavern atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a great secret place off the beaten path. Food was amazing and service good. You might run into a few characters, but that just ads to the unique vibe about this place. Prime rib night aint no joke. Go early and go hungry. It may be more than a three hour tour. Bring your favorite crew and check it out."}
{"text":"Cool local spot. It is a seat yourself atmosphere with some good food. I had the oysters there and I thought they were awesome especially for the price. I also got the spaghetti plate and it was ok. Nothing to amazing but a good portion. I would definitely go eat here again. Cool lil dive bar feel."}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday night for a couple of drinks and some dinner as it had been several years since my last visit. The menu has been upgraded from the old typical bar food selection to more of a neighborhood family place. The staff and service were great but the place is small so there was only one bartender and one waitress to handle everything.Not having any beer on tap is something of a drawback but otherwise the bar is a nice cozy environment. The Saturday prime rib special was about as good as it gets for $15 which included a drink and desert."}
{"text":"Don't be scared away from the outside \"divey\" appearance -this is not your typical bar food.  Went to dinner here with family who lives in Vegas.  Prime rib, steak, philly cheesesteak sandwich, spaghetti and a meatball as big as a baseball!  Had a table full of great food and none of us were disappointed."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Las Vegas! Crazy good daily specials! Friendly staff! I went on Saturday night for prime rib special & it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Always a great time here with great food and friends.  The prime rib ,the Ruben and the fish platter are all very good. They have specials all week and the Saturday night prime rib is the best. Stacey takes great care of us every time we are in here."}
