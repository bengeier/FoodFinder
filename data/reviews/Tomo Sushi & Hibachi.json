{"text":"Habachi was good but the sushi was terrible! We asked for California roll with cream cheese and they brought it out with cubes of cream cheese!"}
{"text":"We sat at the sushi bar.  No hot hand towels.  Waitress was nice.  Not the freshest salad with a strange ginger dressing... more creamy than typical.  Hardly acknowledged by the sushi chefs (until we put a tip in their jar at the end). Our favorite rolls were the Naruto and the Cleveland.  Spicy tuna, meh.    This place feels like they're trying to be too many things.  Apparently it's also a hibachi grill, hookah lounge, night club upstairs and bar.    Final rating:  Could have been worse."}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment. I was even open minded that I'm in Ohio, I shouldn't expect Jiro Dreams of Sushi.  First off, my dirty martini was undrinkable, tasted like olive juice, no vodka. So I asked for Ketal one on the rocks.  Can't mess that up. Then we ordered sashimi and the Naruto roll.  The white tuna had 2 short dark hairs on it. I didn't want to make a scene, so I just told the sushi chef to remake it discretely. Do yourself a favor, stay away from this establishment."}
{"text":"I had read the reviews prior to going last night.  Was not too sure, but my young professional daughter was excited for her birthday night out and she had a groupon for Tomo.  We had reserved a table for 4, did not want the hibachi experience. Upon arrival, 1st thing hostess said was \"this is my first day so not sure how everything works\" not \"hello\", \"good evening\" or \"welcome.\"  She proceeded to try and seat us at a hibachi grill table, but we repeated our original request.  She then wanted to seat us at a table right next to the kitchen door with a flat screen TV over it, with a hockey game (several other open tables).  We requested a different table and she moved us.  While the ladies went to the restroom, we ordered drinks. When they came back that had a strange look on their faces. They said the restrooms were 3 floors down and were the grungiest they had ever seen/experienced. The drinks came, vodka tonic and gin and tonics.  Tonic was flat, absolutely no carbonation what so ever, and pretty watered down to boot.  Next round I ordered a beer (tough to mess that up, right?). They brought my Labatt but no offer of a glass.  My daughter's cocktail was tasty, but later they took it off the table before she was done drinking it.  I had the Maki Combo II entre.  Sushi was good, not great.  I had to remind our waitress, who had also stated that she was new, that our entr√©es came with soup and salad, which we received 5 minutes after our entre.  Then the check, as it was presented the waitress explained that there was a mandatory 18.5% gratuity to cover the chef and bus boy (there were only 4 of us). I can almost understand the mandatory part on large groups, or if we were at hibachi table where your tipping on both service and entertainment value, but honestly, I was offended.   The Groupon took the sting out of the $160 check for 4. I tipped their mandatory gratuity, though most places I would tip 20%, the experience here was not worth it.  Overpriced, dirty, poorly trained staff with very average food.  Atmosphere can best be described as a Japanese Waffle House married to an indoor food truck.  I would say this place will be out of business in the next 6 months."}
{"text":"Amazing service by Steven. He will give you tips on what to choose, the house special sushi was great and the hibachi was excellent."}
{"text":"The worst place to eat, the service was slow and the food was not so great and they over charged us and the OWNER was rude and refused to speak with me regarding my bill. She was very nasty to me and I heard horror stories before that the owners were racist and speak down to African Americans but I experienced it first hand. Tomo also has a lot of negative reviews on Yelp and Yahoo.com regarding their services and rude owners. I will NEVER eat here again and either should you."}
{"text":"There was only 4 of us, and it took just under 2 hours to get our food. Once we did, there was nothing real good about it. We sat regular seating and got hibachi chicken and steak. Steak was chewy (and done, not medium rare like ordered) and chicken was rubbery. Would not recommend to anyone. Service wasn't great either. Positively, they never let the water glass get below 1/4, but sometimes would try and refill the waters within a couple minutes of each other."}
{"text":"Had lunch here and service was fast, but server did not ask if I wanted soup or salad. Reason for 3 star review is I am not sure how fresh the fish was. Tuna looked to be frozen and lacked the deep red I look for in tuna."}
{"text":"The sushi is really good, but the service is just okay and the the \"half off\" sushi night is misleading. There are only a few rolls on the half off menu, and they are more like 25% off rather than half off."}
{"text":"This place is extremely overpriced to start. My sushi which was a VERY basic roll was $17 for 8 small pieces. The sushi was below average even for Cleveland which doesn't have good sushi to begin with. My girlfriends Hibachi was $27! The hibachi wasn't great by any means. You can go to basically any restaurant in Cleveland for these prices and get MUCH better food. I will never go back and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Look, there's no question about the quality of the food....it's good, especially the Sushi.  The problem is it might take you until the next day to actually get it.  The service, as noted by previous reviews, is downright atrocious.  I was served a beer that felt like it had been sitting outside in the hot summer sun for the entire day.  Why they even felt it was alright to serve it to me is beyond me, but the look of confusion I got when I asked for another one was priceless.   I'd tell you to avoid this place, but my guess is that it isn't going to around for a long time."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely terrible!!!!!! First of, the staff was rude. They gave us a Hibachi cook who couldn't speak English so he couldn't understand anything we asked him. I made reservations for 5 for the hibachi at 7. We didn't get seated until 7:45, and the waiter made us wait 35 minutes before we could be seen by the Hibachi cook.   He then added a group of 3 ladies to our party/table, so he could receive the 18 percent gratuity,  which is added to parties of 6 or more. He gave us unclean plates, with hair on them. And I received an unclean glass with spots and smears all over it. The Hibachi cook was rude and racist. The waiter kept lying about when we were going to finally be served. Meanwhile, I had tickets to The Ultimate Michael Jackson Who's Bad Concert at 9:00pm @ The House Of Blues. By this time, when we get served it was 8:45. We wound up having to get our food to go, while still having to pay the dine in fee.   The Hibachi cook had all of the food prepared at 9:00, the time of our show. Meanwhile, the ladies who were added to our party had a terrible experience as well. One actually pulled HAIR out of her mouth! She pushed her plate away in disgust, and said she wasn't paying a dime for a meal that was seasoned with herbal essence. After examining her food, she found another long blond strand of hair in her chicken. By that point, I as utterly turned off. I pushed my plate away, and didn't eat another bite. The other ladies in her party didnt as well. Fucking YUCK!  We asked our waiter for the manager, because our entire party, including the ladies added to our reservations,  wanted to talk to him. The waiter lied about how long it would take him to come, he said like an hour. We said, we were already late to our concert on behalf of this terrible experience, so we would wait. We continued to wait 15 more minutes, and my friend finally to the waiter to just tell her where the manager was, and she would go get him herself,  he pointed her in a direction and lied about who the manager was. We finally got belligerent at that point. The manager finally showed up 5 minutes later.   We told him of our awful experience, from the point we got there til now. The waiter actually ended up screwing up the bills for the entire Hibachi table. I wound up having a extra bill of 91.40 when I only had 50.00 of food, and a Groupon worth 50.00. So I basically ate for free. After their remedial at skills tried to calculate our bill, they wound up giving me a bill for 37.25. I told them I'm not paying it, because it was incorrect. I had only had 50.00 worth of food, and a 50.00 Groupon for it. The bill said we had a group of nine people, when we had eight, but i had made resercations for five. We had to wait, about 25 minutes to get billed out, and get everything settled. We got a discount of 35 percent off of our bill, and a bunch of phony apologies. I wound up paying th e nine dollar gratuity  I have no clue what happened to the other ladies, because we were extremely late for our show. By then it was 10:12pm. Thank goodness, the review was delayed and started EXACTLY at 10:15, as we were walking into the House Of Blues! We had a Fabulous time there. I was glad I didn't trade out my first time customer HORRIFIC experience at Tomo, for the AWESOME one I had at The House of Blues. I was sure we missed the concert,  but we didn't.  And I was ecstatic, because I had those tickets booked since February!   Tomo is terrible, they are racist, they scheme, they are rude, and they are DIRTY AS HELL. WOULDN'T RECOMMEND YOUR DOG TO EAT SCRAPS OFF THE FLOOR AT TOMO. We should have just went to Wasabi! I will post pictures of the measly portions provided by the racist non-English speaking Hibachi cook. The portions were extremely little for this place to be so damn overpriced. I was extremely underwhelmed, and felt like I wasted 1 1/2 of my life at this racist hell hole!  The added 3 white ladies to our party said it was their first time their as well, and we were just trading stories of great experiences at other Hibachi restaurants, and comparing them to our ratchet one at TOMO.  Definitely won't be back. They are disgusting and ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this shack of a restaurant zero stars. Horrible service, horrible hostess. DO NOT Go here if you want any sort of good service. Horrible. Direct quote: \"I can sit you near a hibachi table so you can  look at the action.\" - Don't even waste your time at this dump."}
{"text":"One of the worst places to eat in downtown Cleveland. I have been there twice now and both experiences were equally as bad. We had reservations both times and had to wait an hour for our table when we arrived. We had very poor service when we were finally seated. I ordered the chicken hibachi and the chicken was very dry, almost not edible. I will never go back to this sorry excuse for a  restaurant."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend to Tomo over the weekend, and it was quite disappointing.  **Fair Warning...if you eat at a Hibachi table, there is automatically 18% gratuity added to your check no matter what size your party is..ABSURD!!** Our server was nice, however he was extremely over the top and obnoxious.  He continually yelled at the table trying to be funny, but was not; he even spilled a drink all over the table/customer and blamed it on the customer for getting too much grease on the glass from his hands.  I have been to many Japanese Steakhouses (it's my favorite food), and have had many different experiences with the taste of the food, but this place was by far the worst food I've had.  First, the soup had no flavor to it...it pretty much tasted like water with some onion and mushrooms in it.  Next was the salad, and it wasn't bad.  After about 10 minutes, the chef came over and did his thing.  He was very nice, and funny.  As I started to eat, it became more and more obvious that there was little, to no, flavor in the food.  As we finished up, our server brought us the bill and it was $107!  I was outraged...they charged me $16 for a Knob Creek on the rocks alone.  In addition to that, my girlfriend is a vegetarian, so all she got were some veggies, rice, and noodles.  Overall, the food was not that great, and extremely overpriced...I will not be returning there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Dont expect much. Prices are not what other reviews make them out to be...typical downtown prices. Sushi was blah. Waiter blamed the kitchen on timing of our order...... everything came at different times....so it is a possibility but could have also been an excuse. Didnt do the hibachi or smoke hookah so no comment on that. Salad was mostly iceburg. Appetizers tasted either old or prepped ahead of time and frozen until ordered.. (not a great way to bserve seafood).  Maybe il l try the hibachi next time but i dont know."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in downtown CLE!!! Being European and with all the experiences I gathered from many cultures and cities I have visited I can promise you this restaurant won't dissapoint you! Their sushi is extremely high class and hibachi barbecue was a lot better from what I've seen in the reviews! If you want a great food, unbelievable drinks, amazing hookah and pleasant service... Seriously visit Tomo!!!  Honor to meet owners and share some extraordinary moments with them was just a plus to a great experience I had in Cleveland and I can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"This was the worst service I have ever experience at a Hibachi restaurant.  Servers looked high on drugs!  For the price we paid the portion was size of Happy Meal! Took over a hour to get served! Manager was not very considerate either! Tomo nomo for me!"}
{"text":"Awful food and service. Dont waste your time. Me and my family came in here to visit the restaurant and we felt so uncomftorable . Owner of the place walked around as a king thinking he owned entire cleveland. Tomo sounds like nomo. Dont  bother . On top of it over priced for something that you could even get at regular carry out place."}
{"text":"Sushi gets an A+. Everything else is sub-par. I recommend going on Wednesday nights when the sushi is half price!"}
{"text":"Sushi is ok. Cannot comment on Hibachi. Seems very large and was very very cold when eating. The radio was on? So when I walked in to the nice decorated restaurant  I heard the traffic report blaring in the background. Very noisy. Since sushi rock does not seem to be opening, this might be a good place to pick up sushi...I'm not sure if I will ever dine in again. Also, no cocktails? odd. beer selection? barely.  Has potential to be nice...they just aren't there yet."}
{"text":"Alright back from our weekend to #theland ... we end up going to Tomo.  I'll put it into one word: .... AMAZING!   We wanted to get there early, I made our reservation at 4 on Friday, but didnt have trouble getting into the city or finding an ideal spot to park like we thought.  We got to Tomo at around 3:15...it was dead in there so they were able to get us a table when we arrived.  The place is HUGE, it has four floors (a dance club, a lounge, two levels of hibachi tables).    The hostess told my girlfriend and I, that they usually dont get busy til night time (like 9pm or later) especially on Fridays for the club and lounge, so I was surprised by that.   The food was incredible!  We got asparagus rolls which were fantastic, then the hibachi entrees included sumashi soup, a salad, then the chef came and cooked our meal.   The chef was beyond hilarious, he came out singing early 2000s pop songs to us (completely unexpected).  Made us crack up on more than on occassion.  Had the food ready in 15 minutes, but you dont even realize it was that quickly because your mesmorized by the show.   I got the chicken and my girlfriend got the steak/shrimp entree...they were INCREDIBLE!!       I cannot boost this place enough, if you live in the area...please check it out!  This place is incredible...the food is literally top 3 places I have ever eaten in my life.   We walked away in pain because we ate so much food haha...then follow it up with a dessert of the Cavs WHOOPING the Hornets, great evening!!"}
{"text":"Recently took my family from out of town here. Great atmosphere.  Delicious food.  Hibachi chefs are hilarious. Server Shawn was great and very attentive."}
{"text":"We had a groupon to use and wanted to try a new place. It was a late evening reservation and we were the only customers.  The staff seemed a bit disorganized and not sure what exactly they were supposed to be doing.  The sushi was good but I doubt we will return."}
{"text":"Had hibachi last night at Tomo and it was fabulous!  Fast, friendly service.   Food was excellent, especially the scallop hibachi."}
{"text":"Horrifying. Awful. Never again experience. Made a reservation for 8:15, got sat it was fine and dandy until we didn't see a server for another 15 minutes, didn't get our salads for an hour and a half then  finally TWO HOURS after our reservation time we got our food..our chef had zero personality, didn't give us saki...which some were looking forward to just because it's fun..it took at least a half hour for another couple to get their bottle of wine. Then at the end of the night this baboon comes over and we find out he's the owner, who happens to be carrying around a jug of moonshine. He was ridiculous, didn't care about the customers at his OWN restaurant..I'm sorry a damn shot of moonshine isn't going to cut it for the piss poor experience we had here. We were all separate groups at our table and none of us will every return. A little date night went three hours too long.   Horrid horrid horrid.  Don't waste your time, make a little drive to Wasabi and it will be worth it."}
{"text":"Realistically, I'd probably give Tomo 3.5 stars, but as that's not an option I'll go with 4, because I did really love the sushi.   I went to Tomo with my SO and a Groupon in hand on a Friday evening. We absolutely love sushi and had never been here, so we were pretty excited. Walking in, I did not see what I had expected to see. For the prices of the sushi (special rolls hovering around $20 or slightly less) I expected something a bit more upscale. I'm not a fancy gal whatsoever, the place simply was not what I expected. So I guess that's number one: be warned, the prices do not match the atmosphere.   Our server was nice. However, and I hate to say it, she honestly seemed like she was \"on something\". It took her several seconds to process everything we were saying, she spoke very slowly and almost slurred, and just didn't seem...\"right\". I try to give the benefit of the doubt (who knows, maybe it was just a bad day), but I was honestly worried about her. That being said, we did get all our food and drinks in a good amount of time.   The sushi was fresh and delicious. The presentation was beautiful. We got the black dragon roll, the sexy girl roll, and one with a few types of tuna that I can't remember the name of. I can't pick which was my favorite! They were all great.   Overall: loved the sushi but most likely won't be back due to the price not matching the experience. I can find cheaper sushi with the same experience."}
{"text":"When we walked in the door, the hostess was texting on her phone, with a cigarette and lighter in her hand, about to walk out the door. We immediately noted the trashy atmosphere and overly-loud elevator music, but kept an open mind.   For food, we started with two salads. The garden salad was decently sized, but completely drenched in dressing that tasted too much of mayo. The seaweed salad was decent, but obviously not fresh.  For dinner we got the chirashi (raw fish and rice) and sashimi/sushi plates ($29 each). After about 2 bites we had to send it back. The fish was inedible, clearly not fresh or of good quality whatsoever. When we told our waiter about the issue, he told us he would get the manager for us. After waiting about 10-15 minutes for the manager, he told us that \"everyone else loves the sushi\", as if we were lying.  The atmosphere was awful, the food was disgusting and expensive, the service was lousy. This was, in fact, the first time we have ever felt compelled enough to send food back. The only redeeming quality of tomo was that after complaining we didn't have to pay for a thing, we just wasted our evening and had to go elsewhere.  Tomo, more like nomo"}
{"text":"Visited tomo tonight, My friend and I. We had hibachi and then paid our bills and moved to the bar for drinks. We sat down and order a shot and then ordered a hookah. 35 minutes later our hookah came after actually a few times when it was coming. Our hookah came out, an important piece was missing off of it and the owner came over and fixed it for us. We began to smoke it and watch the bubbles form at the bottom of the hookah. This was when we realized that there was stuff floating around in the water. We looked closer and saw that it was mold! We told the bartender and she acted carelessly while saying she would bring us a new one. Now that we have spent our entire night there I told her to just take it off of our bill for us and we were leaving. The owner came over and we complained and his response to my concern was \"Next time don't buy the hookah\". The most awful encounter I've ever had with a business owner, let alone one in such an area, a prime part of down town! We told him that we were leaving and I refused to pay for our drinks. He claimed that was theft and said that we weren't leaving without paying. We asked if he was going to force us to stay and he said he was going to do so and call the police. He called the police and when we tried to walk outside where we felt safe, he barricaded the door with his 6'3'' 300lb body. THIS was the most inappropriate experiences I've ever had! I will never go back to this establishment and direct all else not to either!   $20 worth of drink from customers who just spend $150 on dinner then were served moldy hookah IS NOT WORTH THE FIGHT!  Worst customer service ever! Not only that but to put customers in fear like that really blows my mind! DO NOT EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE.  I wish I could give this place 0 stars.  Food was expensive but solid, drinks overpriced, hibachi chef engaging, but service HORRENDOUS!  Service:  This is where Tomo loses all the stars.  Our server seemed lost, confused, and obviously had no idea how to handle a group or keep track of receipts.  After dinner, we got our checks and all paid individually (there were 6 of us).  We took our time at the table after we were paid up just to make sure everything was settled, and the owner came over to invite us to the upstairs lounge.  3 of our party were sake'd out (the chef has a bottle that he squirts in your mouth, we had about 6 rounds), but the other 3 of us went upstairs where there were some hookahs, music, and another bar.  My friends got drinks but I needed a break after the hibachi sake so I started dancing on the (empty) dance floor.  A few minutes later I noticed our server pulling one of my friends into the hallway and accosting her with accusations that 2 of our party didn't pay.  The server was pointing to 2 different receipt books and loudly saying that not everyone paid and that we owed her $60.  Because we were intoxicated, embarrassed without reason, and the server wouldn't stop harassing us, we eventually just gave her the money and left (we probably would have been more assertive if sober, but we just wanted to get on with our night and have a good time).  When we got back to our hotel room and reunited with the rest of our party, we all found our receipts (further proof we had all paid) and confirmed we had been scammed by the waitress (even worse behavior since I had already tipped 25% when paying my original bill).  This is truly unacceptable behavior by the restaurant and the staff, and looking back it seems like we were targeted because we looked like we just wanted (and could afford) a fun night out and didn't want to be hassled.  Yeesh..."}
{"text":"Whoever rang in our check took my boyfriends credit card number /information and the account was breeched less than 24 hours later. I have no respect for this place"}
{"text":"If I could, I would give this place a zero. Horrible service. Food is overpriced for the quality. The silverware was filthy, napkins were unclean. Tomo is not upscale at all. If you go to the bar/club upstairs the crowd is very disrespectful, uncivilized & immature. Also, you will have to walk through an alley, by large trash bins, in the middle of the night to find your way back onto W. 9th. This is a very bad addition to the Warehouse District."}
{"text":"Awful! The sushi is average, at best, and over priced. The service is terrible. I would highly recommend that you travel a few more blocks to Sushi Rock."}
{"text":"Great food and it's entertaining to watch food cook! My only complaint is that the server took about 10 minutes to greet us and the chef took an additional 15 minutes to bring the food out. Food was amazing though! Service was the only reason I didn't give 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place Almost lost us when my husband called for reservations!!  On the phone the hostess seemed very inept - and that had us worried!  When my husband dropped me off to park the car, I quickly understood why he said the hostess seemed very unprofessional!  Just one example (other than her outfit...), - after asking if she should bring water to the table, she walked out with ONE glass!!  Even though she knew that my husband  would be joining me!!       Now the Good News!!  Our waiter Stephen Saved the Day!!  He really knew his stuff!!  And without asking, he noticed that our table only had one glass of water and supplied us with another!  He was attentive and informative! He helped us choose the sushi and was spot on! It was delicious!  My husband also ordered hibachi, and I said to my husband that I would just share some of it .  Stephen heard me and when he brought out the food, he had it on 2 plates so we could share!!  This guy is fantastic!  We were on our way to the Indians game so Stephen was smart enough to know that we were not there to hang out a long time - so he made sure that everything came out at a good pace without making us feel hurried.      We saw the owner sitting outside and mentioned about the unqualified hostess and the fantastic server!  We will be back because the food was very good and we will Definitely request Stephen as our server!   And we recommend that if you want good service you should ask for Stephen as your server as well!"}
{"text":"Terribly run. Arrived for our reservation...no table ready. So they offered us a hibachi table immediately. We accepted but never even ordered. Us and the others at the table waited over an hour and only got 1 drink, and didn't even place our orders before we had enough and left. There's no shortage of Japanese steakhouses in the area. You can do a whole lot better than this place"}
{"text":"Our new favorite Sushi place! We went on a Saturday night.  There was a steady stream of people.  We went there for Sushi and sat in the front.  I believe there is a hibachi in the back and there were people there too.  The sushi was awesome.  Godzilla was amazing..Highly recommend it!  The service was good.  The waiter was very nice and prompt. We used a half off coupon but even without it the prices were good.   We loved the area this restaurant was in.  We will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Food was good. Expensive. But the reason I gave 1 star is that the chief was rude. Rude as in asking unnecessary questions."}
{"text":"I've been here for two hours and our party is still waiting for our food. The sad part is that we are gathered here to celebrate a 60th birthday! If I could give 0 stars I would. If you are thinking about coming here, do yourself a favor and go to Benihana instead if you don't want to pass out from starvation."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that has good sushi but other places have great sushi! It doesn't compete on the level it needs to be at for great sushi. The sushi has good flavor but the rolls are smaller than other places and with a heftier price tag. The surf and turf roll is close to $36 while other places serve the same roll for $18-$24. Maybe they can charge more because of the location of the restaurant but for someone who has to pay to park and eat I want more bang for my buck + more flavor."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and can say that the sushi was the only good part of the experiences.  A groupon brought me here the first time, so I made a reservation for 5:30, right after work. The place was a ghost town when we got there, so that was a little scary, since a lack of customers might mean the place is horrible. The host was frantic for some reason and urged us to sit outside, which was nice, but the table was cramped, wobbly, and we were accompanied by a loud and obnoxious bored valet who apparently knew everyone that walked by.   We got drinks that were tasty, but didn't seem to include much alcohol. The edamame was good and there certainly was plenty of it--no complaints there! Between the two times I've been here, we tried the Dynamite, Supernova, Volcano Maki, and Dancing Girl rolls. They were all very tasty and I'd definitely order them again. Disappointment: we wanted to try sea urchin and they didn't have it both times we came--the first time, we got a replacement suggestion, the second time, the guy just walked away on a mission to check if they had it and never said another word. Unagi sashimi is delicious (one of my favorites!) and the octopus was meh...not really a huge fan of it.   The real problem here is the service and hibachi. Our second endeavor was with the goal of getting a group of people together for a nice night out. Everything was fine, but our hibachi cook didn't interact with us, was very serious, and didn't do any of the classic hibachi tricks for us. To me, a gigantic pile of rice and generically sauced veggies is NOT worth hibachi price if you aren't going to get a show with it...that's the whole point of it. Major disappointment there. Our waiter was also pretty lame. He kept forgetting orders, getting things wrong, and assuming certain people were ordering particular things right off the bat.   I'll never come back for hibachi--though hibachi isn't my favorite thing in the world, so that's not a huge loss--but I'll definitely be back for a weak moscow mule and some sushi again!"}
{"text":"I went to Tomo with a groupon on a Saturday night. Like the other reviewers, we had a reservation and were there a long long time. After reading the reviews for the hibachi we decided to sit at a regular table and do sushi  & hookah instead. The hostess was rude, the drinks were overpriced, the sushi was good but way too overpriced for the quality and amount, and the service was sloooow. We had to get our second round of drinks ourselves at the bar. I am giving two stars because 1, we sat outside, had drinks, smoked hookah and the experience was overall enjoyable. 2, the sushi that we did have, while overpriced, was pretty tasty. Wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Typical Japanese steakhouse which is both entertaining and expensive. This one is just like any other one I've been to but this time we had our grandchildren with us which was fun to watch their reactions to the entertainment of having food grilled right in front of us.  Sadly, I missed getting his name but he is the \"temporary\" chef while chef is overseas.   Sarah was our server and she did a great job.  Our group of 4 adults, 2 grandsons (5 and 6) ate the following around the hibachi table:  Seaweed salad (just one serving to taste)  Kid's filet mignon Kid's chicken Shrimp Chicken and Steak Scallops Chicken and Shrimp all served with a starter miso soup (tasted like water and I could not eat it), salad with the best ginger dressing I've ever tasted, generous portions of grilled veggies, followed by fried rice and then the grilled meats.  Along with 2 hot sakes, 2 beers and 1 hot tea.    We had TONS of food to take home with us!  Total bill before tip was $226"}
{"text":"Our family of 4 stopped in for dinner last night for our first dining experience at this restaurant. The amount of food and quality was commensurate with similar restaurants. However,  I must say I was glad the cook did NOT use an unnecessary amount of oil as I have experienced in some places.  The food was well prepared. The meal was complemented by their quality customer service and comedic banter! We had a great evening!! We plan to return."}
{"text":"Disappointing night at Tomorrow, waited an hour and finally left because they only had 2  hibachi chefs for upstairs and downstairs.  They were not prepared for a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Just don't. Even though they weren't busy, the floor and rugs were filthy. The stairs and basement, where the bathrooms are located, reeked of water damage and mildew. Something was floating in my soda. We were served hot sake in a clear glass bottle with shot glasses. Ordered gyoza and left. You couldn't pay me to eat raw fish at this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here last night on a last minute dinner date. Service was phenomenal and the food was fresh! Great sushi rolls we had Maki Combi #1 and an order of Shumai. I have lived in NYC for 6 years and the freshness of the rolls was on par with some of the more expensive, well reviewed places in NYC. I would definitely come again and recommend this as a great sushi place in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"All food was very hot. Delicious. Not sure why negative reviews. Stuff was very nice. Definitely coming again"}
{"text":"Had reservations at 5:30pm. Took our order right away and got us drinks, but the hibachi didn't get started for over an hour 1/2! I had 2 sushi rolls both were absolutely horrible!!!   The owner Tony cooked our hibachi order because all of the other cooks were busy downstairs.  He was funny and friendly, but not a cook! The rice was burnt and the veggies under cooked. Horrible!   The servers were friendly and tried to keep our party happy, but after waiting so long only to be served horrible food I was highly disappointed. Won't be coming back if I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night. It wasn't my first time there but everything was amazing as always. The sushi was very fresh and the habachi was amazing. After our meal we sat at the bar for a few drinks and the bartender made some great cocktails. If you have never been here before I highly recommend you check it out. The place had great weekend nightlife on the upper levels as well."}
{"text":"The best hookah, great food and service. As a resident downtown there's no other place to be!"}
{"text":"One of the best hibachi places around! Rice and yum yum sauce tastes amazing, and it's usually a great place to reserve ahead of time if you're looking to entertain a larger party. Really great customer service and great for anniversaries and birthdays."}
{"text":"After watching this empty storefront for months, I was excited to finally get to eat at Tomo! My roommate and I both got sushi and a glass of wine here, and I was pretty happy with my experience.  The layout of Tomo is a little strange - when you walk in, there's a bunch of tables, with a bar on the right, and a sushi bar on the left, a little further down. We decided to eat at the sushi bar, and the server placed us in the center of it - an odd choice, since it meant my roommate was facing a giant fake flower and couldn't see the chefs or the mirror behind the chefs all that well. Further back in the restaurant were some hibachi tables with groups of people around them. It was a little strange to hear the hibachi chefs as we were eating - they sounded like they were decent entertainers, but to listen to that as you're NOT eating hibachi was a little weird. I wish they had divided the restaurant up so that the sound was better separated.  The...owner? Manager? Someone important? came up to us twice to check on how we were doing. He seemed very nice and clearly was hoping we were having a good time - he was also very clearly excited about the restaurant and building, and talked about some of his plans for it - for instance, a tea room on one of the upper floors. I had no idea this place was 5 floors, or that Tomo owned them all. UNFORTUNATELY, he also twice offered to give us a tour, and his tone and words came off a bit more than a little creepily. I am pretty sure that he was just being friendly and excited, and I later saw him talking to many other patrons, but as a pair of 20-something girls, we just didn't feel comfortable taking him up on his offer. In a larger group, I would have love to have seen the rest of the space, and I feel bad because I really do think he wanted to show off the space. In the future, I think I would have felt more comfortable had he gotten a larger group of patrons together and invited us, rather than making it sound like it'd just be the three of us. I feel bad even writing this, but we both felt pretty uncomfortable at the time.  I ordered the miso soup, spicy tuna roll and California roll - I had really wanted to try some of the specialty rolls, but many of the more interesting ones were $18 - guaranteeing that there is no way that I'm going to ever get them unless there's some sort of discount deal.   The miso soup was pretty standard, although it was a lot more clear (instead of yellow) than I'm used to, and had mushrooms in it. As a mushroom-hater, I was able to pretty easily avoid the fungus floating in my bowl. I would have preferred more greens in it, but it was fine. Both of my rolls were large and delicious to the point where I was uncomfortably full after eating both of them - in the future, I think my roommate and I will probably split 3 between us.   Look - if I'm being honest, I think I want Tomo to succeed and that's probably making this earn an extra half star, but why not? This place has been empty for a year, and it's clear the staff wants to make this work. They're currently the only dedicated sushi place in the Warehouse District (until Sushi Rock reopens), and a heck of a lot better than the sushi at China Sea or prepackaged at Constantino's. Could their decorations be improved? Definitely. Are the hibachi sounds distracting? Yup. Will I go here again? Absolutely."}
{"text":"Steven is a wonderful host to have! Please take any recommendation he has, it will make your meal that much more enjoyable! PS they have a hookah lounge we wouldn't have known about w/o him. Very happy guests :)"}
{"text":"Had reservations for New Year's Eve party of 5 regular table not hibachi at 4:30 the waiter came took my order for appetizers and walked away without taking my guests app orders so we Flagged down another waiter  to go ask ours to comeback so everyone else could order too, ridiculous! Then we placed our dinner order -all sushi  and one order for hibachi, the hibachi order finally came but the raw sushi we ordered didn't come until we asked multiple times to see the manager by the time they came with it one person in the party had already left due to the time it took, keep in mind it wasn't busy at all and they refused any discount do to their obvious understaffing so we ask for it to go seeing as we had New Years tickets to an event. The food was mediocre at best, there are way better sushi and hibachi restaurants with much better consumer service than this dive! Party of 5 never going back to this place."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place 0 stars!  This restaurant is garbage!  Went here on a Sunday night at 7:45pm and there were only 4 other people in the restaurant.  My husband and I sat at the bar and ordered appetizers and sushi.  Our dinner came out before our appetizers, our order was messed up twice, we were charged for things we didn't order, and the owner/manager refused to honor our Groupon.  After complaining and asking to speak to the owner/manager he refused to come downstairs and talk to us.  He told our waitress to tell us...sorry we should have made a reservation if we wanted a groupon.  You know because it's so just so busy with the 4 other customers in the restaurant!  What a joke!  Awful customer service!  I'm going to try to call groupon to get my money back, but they probably won't because the waitress pressed the button to view my voucher!  The owner obviously doesn't know how to run a business because now I will never come back here, and I will tell everyone I know to stay far far away!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times because I live across the street. The sushi is decent, but its overpriced and has terrible terrible service.  It took a girl 30 minutes to get me chopsticks! I will no go back because of the terrible service."}
{"text":"Great authentic sushi. Atmosphere was great. The food was second to none. Outstanding hospitality. The owners are very friendly.   There soups are the best I have had. Hearty. Full Of flavor.  Only the freshest ingredients and fish. The chefs put on a great show too!  Highly recommend this awesome establishment."}
{"text":"After hearing for months and months how amazing this place is, my boyfriend & I decided to check it out. We decided to make reservations due to hearing how busy it is and when booking our reservation, the hostess seemed as if she was \"squeezing us in.\" When we got there, it was empty. For a Saturday night, we were in shock.  After waiting at the bar and being completely ignored by the bartender, the hostess brought us to our seats for hibachi. Our seats were in the aisle way between the servers station and the hibachi table. So the hostess told us, \"to scoot all the way in and then don't move back because the servers need to get through behind you.\" So I followed her instructions, was completely squished, had barely any room to eat and enjoy my night out, but was continually bumped into all night long by servers.   The restaurant is kept way too cold, with the A/C blowing on me all night long, even though there was a nice breeze outside and the doors were open.   Food was decent, not the best I've had, but I did enjoy the large portion. The chef was pretty quiet while cooking, didn't really put on a show, hence why we go to hibachi. So pretty disappointed with that.   My advice, if you want good hibachi that is worth the pretty penny you pay and you want elbow room without bumping into your neighbor while you eat...Tomo is a no no."}
{"text":"Worst priced and experience. Sauces were disgusting.  Too sweet.  Waiter was a total jerk .chef had no talent. Sticking to my guys at \"The Real\" Benihana's."}
{"text":"I went to Tomo, the atmosphere was awesome.  I had the vlad roll and the sandwich roll, omg this was like heaven."}
{"text":"The restaurant smelled like a college bar and the service was not good. Food is overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"Quite the disappointment after waiting months and months to try this place.    Tomo's building is quite unique with 5 different floors- main restaurant (1st floor), VIP area (2nd floor), \"nightclub\" area (3rd floor), \"casual\" bar (4th floor?), private party room (basement) and I am not quite sure / remember what the 5th floor is.  The layout is a bit odd (a mish-mash) of Asian Contemporary with old-school Asian and Craftsman styles.  The service was completely horrendous- they messed up the bills and we were forced into an incredibly tight hibachi table.  Additionally, what was suppose to be maybe a 1.5-2 hour meal turned into roughly 3 hours.  Typically, when you order hibachi and sushi, the sushi comes first.  It was not until after we completely finished the hibachi that we got our sushi.  Many others at the table got their sushi orders before we did and it's fairly safe to say the waiter completely forgot about the order until we asked not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES about the sushi.    I had to have a friend of mine move his chair back and out, every time i wanted to move.  They sat us at this table even though many of the other tables were completely empty.   I got the scallop and shrimp hibachi which was fairly decent, nothing special though.  It tastes like any other hibachi restaurant I have been too.  The hibachi chef was relatively interactive and animated with everyone at the table.  The sushi was where the food went downhill.    I order tuna tataki and salmon sashimi, both of which were ridiculously fishy.  Unbelievably fishy smelling and tasting.  Contrary to popular thought, fresh sushi shouldn't taste fishy or have an overwhelming smell of a sitting dead fish.  If that occurs, that is a big, BIG, MAJOR sign that the fish is not fresh.  I had to leave a few pieces on the plate it was that bad and the rest were slathered in wasabi and soy sauce to mask the taste.  I also attempted to order a bottle of saki and you would expect a Japanese restaurant to know their saki.  When I asked the bartender for a nigori (sp?) type of saki (which is a milky, unfiltered saki), he had absolutely no idea what I was talking about and had to ask someone else.  It wasn't until I went up to the bar and he took out every kind of saki the restaurant had, that he knew what I was referring to.   Never again. I paid $70.00+ for poor service and poor food.  I wish I had better things to say and that I could support the growth of this business downtown, but this is not the kind of restaurant that I want downtown."}
{"text":"Ambiance: 3. Five floors in total. The first floor is very warehousy (shocking), but the basement floor is very impressive.  Didn't see the others, but will be interesting if they host private parties on the top floors or what becomes of this place.  Overall, the place wasn't quite as \"warm\" or inviting as some other Japanese restaurants I've dined at.  Cost: 3. We had only hibachi and appetizers, but did glance at the sushi prices.  Sushi comparable to Sushi Rock (so in other words, a bit of a premium probably because they want to at least try and have fresh sushi).  Most hibachi dishes in the $16-$30 range that I saw, which I'm willing to pay for only once I see an onion volcano.  Food Quality: 3. Soup- luke warm.  Shrimp shumai appetizer- overcooked, wrapped was falling apart.  Habachi was solid though, steak was the best of the three my (chicken & salmon) that my party tried.  Oh did I mention our guy made a mean onion volcano?  I would say the menu is almost too big (if you read my reviews you know I'm not a fan of big menus) - always a sign they have things on there that you want to avoid.  Service: 4. I haven't been to hibachi in probably five+ years, and our guy was better than I remember.  Also waitress was attentive with constant drink and water refills.  Minus one star to the owner, who offered to give us a tour, saw him literally 5 minutes later near the door and thought we were waiting to sit down.    When to return:  When you want to see a volcano but can't go to Hawaii.  Special occasion with a large group of friends or family (the hibachi tables sat 8 if I recall).  Casual after work sushi versus the who's-who-of-Cleveland-feel of Sushi Rock.  When you want to catch some food midair."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced in my life! Ordered a drink and it took 40 minutes to get it. Ordered an appetizer and it came out after the hibachi was served. Ordered a bottle of plum wine and 30 minutes later told that they didn't have any. To top it all off, the bill was horrifically miscalculated. I was triple charged! Then the manager had the nerve to catch an attitude with me. The bill was never actually corrected in front of me. I have to now dispute with my bank. I will never go to this restaurant ever again and do not recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Food was great, thanks to our great hibachi girl!!!! Service was one of the worst in awhile. The waitress was the owners daughter who had no idea how to serve, get drinks, refills, very unknowing of any beers/sake, and how to cash out. We waited for 20 min for her to run our cards to come back and say she has overcharged my friend,  credited back, charged her again and then claims...oops didn't charge you enough and want to have your card again. She then proceeded to tell us how overwhelmed she was and she starts to cry in front of the whole hibachi table. The other waitress tried to console her and it was all very awkward. Don't put your young daughter who isn't trained to waitress a large table on a Saturday night. It was very emabarassing and honestly felt bad for her."}
{"text":"Loved the chef. Sang Happy Birthday in a surprisingly good voice. Respected our quiet time of prayer before the meal.  Food was very good and the chef was quite accomodating with special order (my wife is Vegan). We were there at 5pm on a Sunday, so it was not crowded."}
{"text":"Terrible experience, I would give this place 0 stars if I could. After the they messed up our order multiple times and refused to honor our Groupon the owner was to \"busy\" to meet with us to discuss the situation. I will never return to this restaurant and I urge everyone else to do the same."}
{"text":"Previous reviewer must of drank too much sake as our experience was horrible.  The restaurant was on the recommended list provided by the host of the conference I attended.  The so called sushi chef did not know what quail egg was. I did not get the grilled yellowtail collar as she thought that was part of the sushi order. One of my other colleague did not get his sushi order period. Waiter did not no what a hand roll was. Also the quality of steam rice was very poor."}
{"text":"I am surprised that this place has a 3 star rating! I thought my meal here was outstanding! I got the red rainbow roll, miso soup and a glass of wine and I went straight to heaven. I highly recommend this place for all sushi lovers."}
{"text":"Came in for sushi and a beer and I ended up staying because of the great service. Food was delicious and the drinks were great. I would recommend this place for a group of friends or someone looking for good conversation and a few laughs. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great place to get some sushi. Met the owner and had a great lunch. Tried an assortment of sashimi and sushi combo rolls and enjoyed catching the lunch out on the patio."}
{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!! I went here on a Friday night and what I saw could only be expected to be seen in a movie.  First of all, the waiter did not say a word to us for over 10 minutes.  We he came, I was set to order drinks, sushi, AND dinner (it was late -- we were hungry!).  He wouldn't accept dinner orders yet... Well, okay...  When the sushi arrived, I requested soy sauce.  He rolled his eyes before bringing it to me.  Halfway through the sushi, he took the soy sauce away!!! What?!  Guess I was done with that... The sushi itself was not good -- it tasted like grocery store quality that had been sitting for a week.  When the Japanese chef came out, I thought the experience would change.  He started dropping the \"N\" word to the other African Americans at our table.  This made us feel VERY uncomfortable.  As he cooked, he was rapping the entire time with our table.  We live in the Warehouse District.  We know what Cleveland has to offer.  We love it for its diversity.  But to experience this at a \"nice\" dinner was -- straight out of a movie.  My girlfriend actually asked me \"where are the cameras\" as if we were on Boiling Point or Candid Camera.  The food was okay.  Not the best hibachi I have had, but not the worst.  The steak was really really tough and overcooked - no where close to medium.  The veggies were decent and the scallops were good.  When the check FINALLY came, 20 minutes after we requested it, we noted the server put 25% gratuity on our bill.  Now, I am generally a very good tipper having worked in the industry.  But this experience was terrible -- I certainly did not want to tip 25%.  I tried to talk to the manager about my experience.  I explained that the N*gga this and N*gga that made me feel uncomfortable, as did the 15 minutes of rapping and hooting and hollering and screaming at the table.  There is a line between entertainment and making fools of yourself at a nice dinner.  The owner ACTUALLY called me racist and told me I had no business living in Cleveland if I didn't like this kind of restaurant.  Are you kidding me?!  Avoid this place.  It'll be the best advice anyone ever gave you...."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best, Our \"Hibachi\" chef looks like shes in a hurry. She didnt even wait for the grill to get fully heated. She Barely spoke. And the music upstairs, the bass was so loud that you can feel it from the restaurant. It almost felt like theres a mild case of earthquake around. 10/10 would not go again. Save your money or your Groupon."}
{"text":"Sushi was good. I ordered it to go, and it was still good! Will sit down in the actual restaurant one day."}
{"text":"Atrocious service. Save your money and go somewhere else. Went here for the start of a bachelorette party. We were seated downstairs in the basement at one of the hibachi tables. It was hot and no air was circulating. The heat continued through our 3 and 1\2 hour meal. That alone should tell you how slow the service is. By the time I received my shrimp and scallop hibachi, I was ready to get the hell out of there, and so was the rest of the party."}
{"text":"beware they have no heat in this place!!  there heat is not working its below zero wind chill outside !! upon entering tomo we sat at the sushi bar. we requested to be seated at table  because the sushi bar had a draft coming from the door. so the server moved us to the back table area  right up under the heating vent.  it was blowing cold air. so again we request to be moved again.  the server told my guest that she could not talk to here.  how can a server not want to talk to my guest??? then we got seated for the 3rd time  and my sweetie requested the manager 3 times  it took the manager/owner 30 min to come to the table  he said the heat has been broken for months also admitted that the service was bad!! and he did not have any solutions just kept rambling on and on about how bad tomo  the sweetie ordered sushi i lost my appetite   she said  sushi was just ok  this place is a phony sushi eatery!!  there  was a nice guy who worked busing tables he was the only person who had any sense!!  they really treat u bad my rating is a fff +  i would not send a dog here im gonna treat my sweetie to a real sushi place soon pacific east in beach wood ohio   rating f plus"}
{"text":"If you like sushi but wish you could eat it at a sports bar, then *maybe* this place is for you.  It seems like that's what they set out to do, create a combination sports bar / sushi restaurant / hookah bar.  If you like sports bars then you might see this as a bonus.  I hate sports bars, I don't like noisy restaurants, and I don't like having TVs in my face when I'm eating.  When I'm at a restaurant, I want to be able to focus on my food and my company.  So this is pretty much the exact opposite of what I'm looking for in a dining experience, but that wouldn't get a low vote on its own.  The servers are adequately competent and we liked our hibachi chef but the food was very disappointing.  The appetizer came out after the entrees.  The crab was chewy in the spider roll.  My friend got hibachi and she said her shrimp was chewy.  The best I can say was that some of the rolls were acceptable.  I was downtown another time and my friend wanted to go there so I gave it another chance, same experience.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"This was my first and last time coming here the service was terrible and disrespectful. I will say the food was not that bad but for the price I am paying I would expect nothing but top notch service which I did not receive. The hookah at a price of $35.00 (after the 18% tip that they add) was definitely not worth it. I would not recommend this to anyone. This is a complete let down."}
{"text":"I'm a sushi monster so I've tried every single sushi place in town. First time I came to Tomo I was overwhelmed on how good the food is here and ever since I come at least once a week. Service is great, owners are just awesome and the food is crazy good. Price is very reasonable, quality is unbeatable, atmosphere is wonderful. Also they have lunch specials which are ridiculously cheap! Any sushi and hibachi lover should come here! Can promise you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love this place and I'm surprised at the negative reviews here. The ambiance, food, and drinks are great quality and everyone I've brought here wants to go back. I get that in today's society everyone wants everything now and for the lowest price. Get over it. The best quality sushi costs money but oh is it ever worth it. After my wife and I got sick at another local sushi place, we appreciate the quality.  We have been here with a larger group before and sat in the mezzanine area, which is a great little area for bigger groups. The food doesn't come out within 5 minutes of ordering it but I'm assuming that's because they actually cook it and don't just warm it up? Yeah, good food takes a little longer. Everyone had a good time and the server was friendly and talkative with the group.  I have been here for a business event as well in the upstairs lounge. It was nice to have a place that we could have a presentation that was away from everyone else. There was a full bar up there and we were able to get sushi and Hibachi, which was my first time trying the hibachi. I thought the hibachi was really good and I would get it again but I really can't get away from the sushi!  I would recommend trying this place but know what type of place it is. It's a nice restaurant that serves fresh and high quality food. They cook to order so it's not fast food... but that's why you should try it."}
{"text":"While I have never had the hibachi before, I can honestly say that this is some of the best sushi I have ever had. The rolls are fresh, delicious, and not overloaded with rice. Their California and Salmon rolls are my favorite, and they're all handmade in front of you if you sit at the sushi bar. Admittedly, the service from the actual waiters if you go right after they open is a little shotty, but you're so busy chomping down on your sushi that it's hard to care. I go often on my anniversary dinners with my partner, and I look forward to the experience every time."}
{"text":"Sushi was great. Our server, a cheerful navy veteran, had served in Okinawa and was able to share several Sake traditions. We capped off everything with the fried banana desert. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Not worth the time or money. Drinks are overpriced and weaker than a 12 year old boy. Edamame was microwaved. The sushi was ok- bland, nothing tasted fresh and it seemed the more expensive the roll the thinner the slices were(barely a 1/4\" wide).  TJ hibachi in great northern mall or Ginza downtown puts this place to shame. Glad I had a groupon for Tomo- would've been even more disappointed to pay full price. Maybe their hibachi is better but I would never go back for sushi."}
{"text":"The guy who did our hibachi was so funny!! Between lighting onions on fire and shooting straight saki into our mouths, I didn't know what to be more excited about."}
{"text":"Came here for a party...hmmmm... I would not consider this a party club atmosphere although they have a \"nightclub\" on the top floor.... hmmmm... A disco ball, Elevated DJ stand and private bar....hmmmm... I suppose this makes it a nightclub?  The food is....meh... The hostess at the door has a...meh...personality... The decor is ...meh.... You cannot park on the street so why are there parking meters? Why are they covered? ...and they have an elevator but tell you that it is only for employees....STOP!  So if I am disabled, elderly or cannot climb stairs, I have to walk up?  When they told me I could not use it, I challenged them, because I am an advocate for equality on all levels... so I was the only one in the party who did not to ascend 4 flights of stairs in high heels!   Lastly, but not least... the staff who took us up in the elevator shared some wicked history. I told her I was born and raised in Cleveland and spent much time in this warehouse district for 20 years partying...don't recall this ever being a business... she said... \"Don't tell anyone, but this place has been closed for a loooong time. It was an illegal gay bathhouse and prostitution ring... don't tell\""}
{"text":"Great sushi: I would recommend going directly to the sushi bar where you can see your sushi being made right before you eat it.  Best Roll: Crazy Flying Dragon Maki  Hibachi is nice as well, however, if you are in Strongsville looking for hibachi, drive south on Pearl and go to Shinto"}
{"text":"Luv the atmosphere. Little hookah, half price sushi and great bar. Parking always easy. Great place for lunch downtown or happy hour on your way out of downtown."}
{"text":"Good food - crap service.  Made reservations. At first, they wouldn't sit us at the hibachi table because we didn't know what our party would order (does anyone know this when making a RSVP?) Anyways, we got there a few minutes prior to our RSVP. They sat us at the grill. Awesome. The hostess was nice. She was friendly and complimented us. Good start. Well, we were waiting for one more person to arrive. There was a accident and they couldn't join us directly at 7:30pm. At 7:34 - the waitress had told us that her boss was wondering if we wanted to order so we wouldn't have to move (while waiting on our additional person to arrive) Because the next RSVP was coming in soon. Mind you, this was 4mins after our RSVP. I was quick to notice who their boss was.. Because we were getting dirty looks from her the whole time. Our person arrived a few minutes later after this ride ordeal. We ordered our food, which was tasty. I enjoyed their ginger dressing more than other hibachi restaurants. The sushi was rolled too loose and fell apart on me. Their hibachi chef was really nice and made everything enjoyable. Some girls went downstairs to the restroom, the \"boss\" literally followed them down there. Was a murky/deadly looking area. Did you know they have more grills downstairs? Maybe they should use them if they need additional room. Once we ate, it was like pulling teeth to get drink refills and our checks. Heaven forbid that we order anything else. We had left and then the \"boss\" had been nice to us on the way out... Not a good way to run business. We won't be back, we will take our money elsewhere. We spent a lot of money there in about an hour to be treated the way we did. We were a nuisance in their night."}
{"text":"Great place  Very friendly. Great food. Great bar scene. Owner is very friendly and a lot of fun.  Great vegan options.  Fun Cleveland stories await."}
{"text":"I am not understanding where all these negative reviews are coming from. Sure, the service can be spotty. Some of the staff appears to have lost their puppy before they have come to work.....but their sushi is the shiznick! Not too full of rice, a perfect amount of fish and fresh veggies to boot. The presentation is fantastic and the turn around time from order to mouth is on point.   Their sushi dude has the warmth of a snow pea....but he makes up for it in sushi knowledge. Sometimes, you like the food so much you can overlook some things. The place is clean and the food is AMAZEBALLS. Oh, and it helps it is in an amazing old building with the coolest Elevator! Parking is a chore, but it's downtown Cleveland people....the norm."}
{"text":"I stopped by this place because from the outside it looks very nice I went in to have a drink. the bartender was nice and courteous the atmosphere was not bad however there was a guy at the end of the bar shouting obscenities. He was loud and very obnoxious.   It was a Friday night and the place was empty."}
{"text":"I was there eating with friends yesterday and the owner comes in screaming obnoxiously to employee s and on his phone. It was extremely unprofessional and a little intimidating. Our server was very sweet and nice and knew what she was doing. We could see and hear a big commotion outside from our  seat at the sushi table and our server was fired by the man who came in obnoxiously , and called her names for trying to protect the family dog of the owners. This was a horrible experience and I felt so terribly bad for our server Maddy. I was disgusted."}
{"text":"If you don't know...if you have not been here before...PLEASE add TOMO to your list of places to visit. They have great sushi. They have amazing drinks. They have wonderful hooka. I love TOMO! I love doing hooka at TOMO!!!!!"}
{"text":"Order was placed about 18 minutes before I arrived. The whole staff was fantastic and entertaining, however I waited for the food to be cooked and it 20 minutes one of the host came out and told me that the cook did not care how long we have been waiting. Don't know why he has a job."}
{"text":"Took over an hour for food, the waitress didn't know how to serve at all (couldn't even remember to bring what we asked for), and the fried rice I received was cold like it's been sitting out for the whole day and it wasn't even seasoned or fried all the way. Literally saw chunks of sticky white rice in it. The sushi was average. Will not be returning. (Was a group of 4 and 3 of us are servers so we tried our best to be patient and understanding)"}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is great, just like the service. Favorite place to eat downtown. I LOVE LOVE LOVE Tomo. I don't understand why people leave bad reviews. Anyways I definitely suggest this place to anyone visiting downtown or lives in the area."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today, not a single other group of individuals were there. There were only three of us. First, the server had no idea anything about the menu nor bar drinks (she reminded us that it was only her third day there.. yet she was doing everything on her own and there was clearly a language barrier).. anyways, fast forward to our food arriving. We got the chef's choice of sashimi. The server couldn't tell us what any of the fish was (we didn't know due to it being \"chef's choice\"). However, the real kicker was that all of our fish was frozen. So frozen that you could not even bite through it. I finally gave up and stared at my piece of obliterated sushi with bite marks all over it wondering what in the world I was doing wrong, can you do sushi wrong? I've never been to a sushi establishment and been served frozen fish so this was quite the surprise for me. We also were served dirty appetizer dishes and various plates with black hair on them. Overall would rate this experience a 0 star if I could. Also with all of these issues, no manager or staff came by to speak with us regarding the issues we were having. Not sure how this place is still in business honestly. Next time you want a piece of frozen fish stop at the westside market instead."}
{"text":"My daughter wanted hibachi like at \"home\", so while visiting downtown Cleveland we went to Tomo despite the lousy reviews online. I should have trusted my gut. My daughter and I were one of three parties in the whole place...on a Thursday evening...downtown. That should have told me something right away. I think our server was high or something, he could not form a sentence to save his life. Our \"chef\" maybe said three words to us the entire time we were there. While good with her knives and beating heart rice, she over seasoned and over cooked our food and was completely dead inside. No personality. No excitement. No nothing. Just blah. Sadly, the food matched the atmosphere. It was mediocre. I can get better for at my local food court at the mall for 1/8 the price.  The server and idk, maybe mangers, watched us like hawks, literally over our shoulders ready to pick up finished dishes (because they were so bored) but it took 15 minutes for my beer to come to the table and 20 minutes until they noticed we were done eating, because they were outside. Smoking? Maybe. Drinking? Who knows. The server was a space cadet, so who can say. Our plates were full but basically untouched. For 20 min.!!! When the server came to the table I said just the check please, no boxes. He asked if there was a problem and I said the food was not good, we just want the check and we're ready to leave. He left us and walked up front, another 10+ minutes. Three people came back to our table only for the hostess to tell us that there was nothing they could do for us. I said \"fine, I only asked for my check\". The three walked away and another 15 minutes later came back with \"We spoke to the chef and she says to take $10 off your bill\". At this point I just want to leave. Check comes...18% gratuity automatically added!!! Wtf?!! For that lousy food and service? NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN. SHAMEFUL HIBACHI!!!"}
{"text":"The sushi was amazing as always. We always go there on Mondays for the half off sushi. This time however we had a new server who was very unexperienced. He did not take notes when taking our orders and therefore made many mistakes. Hopefully next time we go he will be better prepared to take a table."}
{"text":"I would make this place give stars back if possible.  Can't rate the food as we waited for 30 minutes without staff even greeting us.  And we had reservations.  Along with the other 10 people waiting in the lobby.  Totally screwed up Valentine's plans as there are no reservations to be had at 7:30 on Valentine's night.  The food may be amazing, but you'll have to survive the wretched service to find out."}
{"text":"Well Ashley M, restaurant success is based on customer service and obviously the experience. I took my wife and child here for my wife's birthday. For a partially dead restaurant, the service was extremely slow and full of obviously new employees. Our hibachi chef did not interact nor was the food to the par we expect. If I wanted a dead chef, I could have gone to EVERY restaurant in Cleveland.   When the owner was notified of this issue, a generic \"come next time, it'll be better\" response was given. I've eaten at this place 2x and had good experience prior to. The shoulder shrug of complacency leads me to respond and recommend to other, \"There will not be another time.\" Avoid this place as there are other quality restaurants around. If you want a real hibachi experience, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU\". False advertisement!!"}
{"text":"$28 / $30 / $26 for \"special\" sushi rolls? Give me a break. I also felt the employee was trying to push us to order expensive stuff because the business had declined due to the RNC Convention in town that week. Asked advice on the Sake selection - and the most expensive bottle was suggested. Food was just mediocre - had a stomach ache afterwards.   In addition to the astronomical prices (Kobe beef was $160 for 8 oz - just saying) it was also a Hookah bar. Interesting combo - japanese sushi bar with middle east hookah. You know you are in the wrong place when this happens. My eyes and lungs were burning!  Im sorry I gave them business."}
{"text":"Great service, great staff, do yourself a favor and check this place out! If the browns players frequent this spot, you know it's the place to be."}
{"text":"this could possibly be the worst food I have ever had in all of Cleveland. I shudder to think of the way the food is handled here when out of sight from customers. anybody who knows sushi would agree that this is a very poor representation. The list of everything that was bad is too long to go into and also too unpleasant to remember in any detail. also, this is one of the weirdest restaurants I have ever been in - in all of my life!!! creepy does not begin to describe it."}
{"text":"Hibachi and hookah all in one?! Two of my favorite things, sign me up!  No.  First of all, it was really weird that this place was pretty much dead on a Saturday night. I know there was a baseball game tonight, but really? Dang. Left around 11 and it still was dead when we left.  So the hibachi chef did not interact at all and acted the whole time like he didn't want to be there. The prices are ridiculous for the quality of food. I thought the portions were generous but the food was really \"meh\". Chicken was overcooked and chewy. The hookah was good, drinks were strong and wait staff was great. Unfortunately this is a restaurant and I base the stars mostly on food and I can't give a place with such blah food more than two stars. As a bar/hookah lounge I could probably give 4 stars. Some establishments clearly have too much going on if they can't focus on making their main pull the best part of the place."}
{"text":"We had 6 in our party and we were given option of where we wanted to sit. First available was fine with us, we were seated at a regular table very quickly. Some time went by and our drink orders finally went in. After our dinner orders went in this is where things went all arong. We all ordered sushi and we had one kitchen order of Steak fried rice.  A whole hour went by when our server finally came back and said, \"somehow her order never went in and our sushi should be right up\". Our sushi came in about another half hour. Needless to say we inahled the sushi. We then noticed the hibachi had went through several tables and we were still waiting for fried rice, another half hour just passed. Servers were flying by and I finally got our sever to stop and said if our rice wasn't done, remove it from our order, and bring us the check. I had to finally flag down another server, after about 15min, and I said I wanted my check and we are finished here. My server finally came to the table to tell me our rice was still not finished??? Our server apologized several times and they did adjust our bill. The sushi was very good, but after this experience I cannot judge on food alone. They need to work on time management and better treatment to the customer."}
{"text":"I'm going to start by saying the food was not bad. I ordered the vegan sushi rolls (avocado)which were ok and me and my friends all got the hibachi combos. My steak was cooked well and my chicken was seasoned well. My reason for giving it 2 stars is as follows: 1. Our drinks took about 30 minutes to come after we ordered them. The night was still pretty early and it wasn't too crowded yet. 2. No rice came with our hibachi combos as stated on the menu. We asked about it and they said they were all out but as we were paying for our meals we saw another table receiving rice and this was not expressed to us when we ordered. We were not impressed with the service at all. Word of advice: do not sit at the hibachi table way in the back. It's right by a lot of kitchen traffic and you will be bumped a lot."}
{"text":"Go there for lunch meal! It's sooo cheap! Steak and shrimp Habachi only around 25$ and sashimi combo only 15$. The chef is funny and will offer you sake!"}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly staff! The food is a little pricey, though. But it's worth it!"}
{"text":"We went last night and it was great. The Lotus Flower was nice and the food was good. Our chef was funny and the Sake was amazing just as my husband. Lol it was very clean and nicely decorated. I kept dropping my napkins and they kept bring me more. I swear I dropped like 5 napkins. The staff was also very pleasant.   We also went to their lounge area up 5 flights of stairs. In heels that was a nightmare bit was nice once we got up there. The owner was super nice and so was his wife. They invited us into their VIP section and we rang in the New Year with them. We had a blast. I will be returning as the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I did not come here for the Hibachi, but just for regular kitchen food and sushi.  Store Layout (4): If you didn't know, this restaurant/hibachi/club/lounge is 5 stories high. Apparently the building has been vacant for almost 10 years before the owner bought it. Hoping that this would be a place for all activities, each floor has its purpose. There's a clubbing floor, a lounge floor, hibachi floor, sushi floor, etc...  Reservation (2): We made a reservation for 12 people at 9PM. When we arrived there, we realized they messed up our reservation and thought that our reservation for for 6PM. LUCKILY, the restaurant was very empty when we got there and we had no problem getting a table. But once our table was set for us, the hostess never walk over to us (we were by the bar) to tell us it was ready until we asked if our table was set!  Service(3): Completely hit or miss. We had a big table of 12 so 2 waiter/waitress served us. My waiter was absolutely amazing, being on time and checking back on us at the right time. However, the other half of the table had horrible service, where their food didn't come out until we were done with ours and their water didn't get filled in time, etc..  Ambiance (3): I walk in thinking this looked like a classy place. But then the staff are all fairly laid back so it's almost a casual restaurant with a classy look?  Kitchen Food (2): I ordered the beef teriyaki. Not that the food didn't taste good, but more just that it was UNauthentic. The teriyaki sauce was way sweeter than I like and it's hard to explain, but the dish wasn't the way I pictured it (even how it was cooked?)  Sushi (4): Not too bad. The sushi is fairly fresh, but being a restaurant located downtown just across the Bingham, you can imagine the size of the sushi vs. the price. It was fairly expensive for the amount of food you're getting. But i guess it's too expected.  Overall (3): There are other sushi restaurants I'd prefer over Tomo. I haven't tried their hibachi yet but it's hard to imagine there's a huge difference in flavor and taste for hibachi restaurants.. I'll be back here again to try the hibachi!"}
{"text":"Wow  I cannot belive a wrote a good review of  this place a year ago As this really was  a horrible expierience. I really hate to be a negative nilly.  But i can not  think of one good thing to say about our last meal here. Bad drinks, air headed service,  crapy  table cooking, frozen fish, I mean sashimi, all in one night.  Omg. Wow.  if you want  rice table side cooking with mayonnaise and ketchup yum yum sauce.  horribly prepaired food, where you can eat component before the next is prepaired,with a waitress who make more excuses for every failure this is your place.  The funny part was there were a table of large ladies accross from our party who's food preperaation seemed. muwith double the quantity and quality even  took home stuffed  boxes. All in all this was the absolute worst meal I have ever been served. Total failure from walking in, excusess for bad drinks, no water, poor food quality, waiting 2 hours for an appetizer, of which only 1/3 arrived at the end of the meal, I had to tell the server that I did not want the other 2/3 OF THE sashimi.  Then when I bit into it the fish was frozen. Fish popsicle anyone? Simply terrible."}
{"text":"Horrible. Service is slow. We set a reservation at 7:30, our chef did not come out until 8:30 we didn't eat till close to 9. The food was very dry and tasteless. It wasn't a fun experience. Our server was also very slow. Our hibachi grill was dirty upon arriving. When we were leaving we saw maybe the owner or manager smoking hookah while he can't even run his staff correctly. Never again"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Everyone was nice enough. But, we had a reservation for 7pm and didn't leave until after ten. Very, very slow service. Two parties of a similar size who arrived after us ate and left long before we did. We also waited a half hour for someone to take our checks and no one did so someone in our party went upstairs to take them to someone. A lady came by about ten minutes later and ask us if we were doing okay and we told her no one had checked on us in a while and she apologized but it still took a while for them to bring the checks back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I always recommend it! And the owner is down to earth! It's a must go! N the vintage style elevator gives the place a nice touch!"}
{"text":"I hate to leave a bad review but the food I had here was really awful. I had the seafood udon soup. My date had sushi and seaweed salad. It was all expensive and his food was rather run of the mill. Mine was awful. I can safely say this is some of the worst Japanese food I've had in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Ug.  I absolutely love eating at Hibachi Restaurants.  They're sort of my guilty pleasure.  I like having several glasses of sake and ordering a huge plate of steak and lobster.   Unfortunately, Tomo didn't measure up.    We had a pretty late reservation, and we specifically requested a Hibachi table.  The hostess looked very surprised, but she saw the reservation, honored it, and sat us alone at a big hibachi table.  After about 15 mins, a few more people joined us.  They asked if it was a problem since we had already put our order in, but it wasn't a big deal. The soup was really good, and the salads (that we had to request, since it doesn't normally come with the meal) were really nice.  The sake was good, but they didn't have any of the big bottles of anything we ordered (not a big deal).    When I went to the restroom downstairs, I realized how grungy this place looks.  It smells like mold downstairs and a light fixture is hanging off the wall in the men's room.  Overall, the upkeep is simply gross.  The most egregious area in the entire restaurant is the area behind the server stand near the kitchen.  My god.  Pick up a broom.  If this is what the customers can see, then I can only imagine what it looks like behind the scenes...and this place serves sushi...  The hibachi chef came, and he started off great.  The fried rice was good but it had nothing in it except egg and soy.  He was entertaining, but we quickly realized he was in one hell of a hurry.  Myself and the man next to me, of a different party, each ordered sirloin.  The chef asked how we wanted it cooked.  I said rare, and he said medium well.  Our steak was cooked at the same time and passed onto our plates simultaneously.  Then came my lobster.  The flat top was set so high that my lobster had black charred pieces on the outside and some raw parts on the inside.  Our chef was at the table for under 15 minutes.  I was very disappointed.  This was not a $75 a head experience."}
{"text":"I'm a sushi lover. I crave it. I was excited to go here with our group last week. Sadly to report, I was disappointed.   Four of us ordered a liquor with a soda mixer and they arrived in different sized glasses and the liquors were mixed up... we had to taste them and pass them around and everyone hoped they'd end up with the biggest of the four glasses. We ordered four different interesting sounding rolls. They were plated with the most boring presentation I've ever seen at a sushi joint. Three lined up on one plate and the fourth lined up on a separate plate... what a huge miss. Sushi is supposed to be a visual culinary art. The two rolls I tried were very bland and one that was marked raw on the menu had cooked tuna filet on top... don't cook my tuna! I can buy that in a can. There wasn't much fish at all inside the rolls.  The atmosphere was dank. The staff were nice, but only gave minimal service. There was no experience here at all. Don't do hibachi, so I cannot rate that. I will go elsewhere for my sushi."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time a couple years back as a group of 4 on a weekend night. We were seated right away at the sushi bar and the sushi chefs were more than accommodating to us. They explained different types of sushi to us, carried on a conversation and taught us a lot that we didn't know. Our waiter was very attentive too, and had our refills ready to go in the blink of an eye. Now, we haven't been back in like a year or so, I don't know how the service is now or if it has changed at all since we've been when they were newer, but our experience was great! We got a private tour from one of the owners that was so proud and happy to show us the whole building. He took us up the old school elevator to the multiple floors above the hibachi ground floor. There was a hooka bar on one floor, a dance club on another. It was crazy to see how much you could take advantage of in one building.  Overall, great service, great atmosphere, perfect placement in the city for a place like this."}
{"text":"I don't understand where all of these negative reviews are coming from.   My 6 year old niece wanted hibachi for the first time. We took her today. She loved it! So did we.   The service was a bit slow. But, that's because there was only one server. Cudos to him for being awesome.   Our cook was incredible. The tricks, fire and laughter was amazing, people from other tables came over.   The food was delicious. I got the steak, shrimp and chicken. Everything was cooked perfectly.   I will say, that they need more staff. A hostess and a few more servers.   All in all, it was an awesome experience that my niece will never forget."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! They have the best sushi I've ever tasted and their hibachi chefs always crack me up! I love how the place is designed too. It looks really clean and beautiful. The girl's bathroom looks very beautiful too."}
{"text":"We came on a Friday Night and the food and service were great!  The presentation and taste of the sushi were amazing.  Also the pieces and rolls were some of the biggest I have ever had!  The same goes for the people who didn't get sushi.  The portions were big and the food was great!"}
{"text":"The service here was soooo fast and our waitress, Michelle, made it even better! She was constantly making sure we were okay and had everything we wanted/needed. She was great at recommending food items based on what we told her we liked and her suggestions were amazing! Thanks for the great service, Michelle!"}
{"text":"I'll start this out by saying I had high hopes and was looking forward to the meal. We had made a hibachi reservation for 9pm and when we arrived they said that they would not have a hibachi table for at least 45 min but, that they had regular tables available and we could still order hibachi dinners and they would just cook them in the kitchen for us. We said fine and sat down and ordered. After 45 min and tables starting to turn around us, the waiter starts apologizing for the wait and keeps saying he will check with the kitchen. Every 10 min he came and apologized... Then the hostess stopped by saying it will not be much longer but was rude and condescending. Time passed and then the manager came by and apologized saying not much longer and brought 3 sodas for 4 kids and told them to share. By now 90 minutes have passed and their behavior is way to suspicious and our teenagers are starving and crying from exhaustion so we call them all over and ask for an explanation.  After being left to wait for 90 min they say they lost their kitchen chef this morning. It is irresponsible, rude and dishonest to accept patrons that you do not have the capacity to serve.  We finally walked out at 10:30pm without haven't eaten and went else where to feed out famished family. Terrible management, rude hostess and dishonest business practices make this one of my worst dining experiences ever and I never even ate the food."}
{"text":"I really like this place! The sushi is very fresh. The presentation is right on . A very friendly staff and owner. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Ordered the most expensive thing on the menu (Live boat for 2 people) and was promptly ignored. Waiter was angry we still had our soup and salad bowls (empty) when he finally showed up with main dish. Lots of staff walking really fast around the place but not busy. Had to ask for water many times and got ignored until the second to last piece - inexcusable when you serve food that is salty! Fish was fresh enough but wait staff are morons."}
{"text":"When it comes to Tomo, my biggest suggestions to have the best experience don't necessarily come from tips about food, but rather, planning your night there.  At Tomo, when they ask you where you would like to sit, choose the Hibachi grill or the left (left as if you were walking in through the main door). If you sit on the right side, Tomo shares an adjacent wall with a noisy night club, and your table will thump with hip-hop music. This obviously isn't their fault for having noisy neighbors, but it can definitely hinder a first date or good conversation.  This also goes for choosing when to eat there. I recommend Friday night, before the bar crowds start rolling into the neighborhood. You'll find better parking, and it will be a quieter experience. As for the food, the sushi at Tomo is quality for the prices, but be prepared to spend a little more than usual. The presentation is beautiful, and the service is fast considering their busy Warehouse District location. I absolutely love the Indian Roll and the Sexy Girl roll, and I must mention how nice it is to have a hibachi downtown. The sushi is worthy of a visit, but if you don't have time to sit down, they will never fail you on takeout."}
{"text":"Great time today. Had a delicious boat of sushi! Also very good handle on the groupon. I was not sure what to expect however left very impressed and will be sure to be back!"}
{"text":"Great menu! Staff was friendly, helpful and had great suggestions. Recommend if you are in the Warehouse District area."}
{"text":"We absolutely love the sushi here! Not to mention the company is great. All the ingredients are organic and fresh! We love coming here and the Hibachi is the best."}
{"text":"I would rather eat gas station sushi than order from here again. This was the worst sushi I have ever had. The fish portions were minimal and the rice was not even one layer of rice so the whole thing fell apart when you held it."}
{"text":"Stopped by after a concert to avoid traffic.  Late night kitchen (but sushi bar doesn't stay open as late).  Enjoyed the Chicken Fried Rice salad, and soup. Bartender was dressed inappropriately, but table service was good despite a warning that it would be slow."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here as an early celebration for our anniversary, and we were sorely disappointed with the service. Despite being one of only two tables in the entire restaurant (on a Friday night when restaurants are supposed to be at their busiest), it took over 10 minutes for the waitress to come and ask us about drinks. Our entrees came with salad and soup: when the salad was brought out, both salads contained nothing but brown lettuce that was covered in dressing (presumably to hide the fact that the lettuce was expired). When we brought it to our waittress' attention, she took it away and never offered to replace it; this wouldn't have been a problem, except the couple seated behind us also received salads that contained fresh, green lettuce. The only saving grace was the hibachi chef, who was very friendly and prepared our food to our specifications."}
{"text":"Amazing!   Love the food ! Owners are so nice and personable!  Not too pricey lunch menu !  Check it out!"}
{"text":"It was just okay, nothing special. Sushi was fresh, but presentation was lacking and staff wasn't knowledgeable on the menu."}
{"text":"If your looking for that traditional Japanese experience then this is the place! Try the steak and shrimp hibachi it's freakin awesome!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!! I went for my birthday and I had an amazing time. The food was really good sushi was fresh. But the best part about it was the chef!!! He made my night! I can't remember the last time I had so much fun going out to eat. But the server was rude and slow and I brought it to the attention of the chef and he got him together. I recommend the place almost daily at my job ( hotel) and everyone always thanks me! Highly recommend this place! Even the take out is great!"}
{"text":"Yeahhhhhhhh........... I'm gunna have to just say no to this place. It just wasn't satisfying. Couple that with the astronomical prices, this isn't a place I would purposefully return to again. Alas, I have another Groupon though, and I likely will just so I don't lose out on more money.   Tomo is interesting. There's hookah, hibachi/sushi, multiple floors, a sports bar-ish area, and a creepy basement bathroom. First off, dinner started with a rowdy group of  game watchers right next to us in the table area... What? Then, dinner ended with a young family smoking hookah one table over... Double what? We could also smell cigarette smoke from the outside patio. I would never expect this from a supposedly high-end restaurant. Which, based off prices, I figured Tomo was. Here's the real kicker. Tomo technically did nothing wrong, but they also didn't do anything right. I made a list on my phone just so I wouldn't forget all these strange things I encountered...  1. The Age Tofu appetizer was fried in tempura batter, as opposed to cornstarch. 2. The sushi size was measly. 3. Avocado used in said sushi was under ripe, making it chunky instead of smooth. 4. The Yellowtail Jalapeno appetizer had fishy flavored yellowtail used.   5. The salad dressing was basically water. 6. We ordered our steak for the hibachi medium rare, and it came medium well.  7. Hibachi also came with scallops. There were \"four\" pieces, but in actuality it was two scallops because they sliced them in half.  8. The hibachi sauce (what I call Yum-Yum sauce) was very ketchup-y. 9. There was no traditional tsuyu sauce for the Tempura Entree we ordered.  I was going to give them a one star review, but I really feel as though the server and manager were friendly. I felt the need to mention this, since other reviews were complaining about a rude wait staff. So, two stars it is."}
{"text":"Would give this place 0 stars if I could. Writing this review as I sit in the restaurant right this second. Had reservations for 8:00 pm, didn't sit down at our table until 9:05 pm. Took FOREVER to get a cook to our table (although we did love our cook, he was so entertaining and good, the only good part of the night).  We came here for my bachelorette party but spent 3 hours here and now have no time to go out and party. It is 11 pm and we are still sitting here waiting for checks. I will NEVER return to this place. I cannot even speak words about how rude our waiter was. My friend asked for a drink with extra ice and he slammed down her drink and said, \"is this enough ice for you?\" He also told us how he fired 5 staff members on this night. And he also reminded us frequently how many OTHER tables he had so he was too busy to deal with us. All in all. I will NEVER RETURN. Tomo, you ruined my bachelorette party. Also we were seated in the basement and it was freezing."}
{"text":"Really surprised at how different this place was from my expectations. The pictures online give the impression of an upscale sushi place. Unfortunately the service and cleanliness were major issues.   We arrived at about 6 on a Thursday night (also Browns game night, which they grill out front, kinda weird for a sushi joint but its Cleveland!). We stood there waiting to be seated for a while, even though the inside was empty, and watched a confused server and manager try to figure out some guys takeout order.   Eventually were seated at the sushi bar, the counter had sticky stuff on it, and when I went to flip my placemat over I was hit with an overwhelming nasty smell. Placemats stayed down after that. To make things more annoying, a server was using the rest of the sushi bar counter next to me to organize the wine bottles and put stickers on them. Like close enough that the wine bottle were touching my arm. The spot also gave us a front row seat to all the server's bickering. When it was finally over, we had to get up and ask for someone to bring us our check. And the bathrooms downstairs? forget it... all the lights are off downstairs where the bathrooms are, and once inside everything has a nice layer of dust all over it.   Not worth the 1/2 off sushi special they run on weeknights (which requires the purchase of a drink first, don't forget!)"}
{"text":"I read all the reviews of this place before coming, noting a lot of bad reviews of the service, but decided to give it a chance anyway. The place was basically empty when I came, but I guess it was a snowy Tuesday night after all. We were taken to a table right away, which was to be expected. The hibachi chef was pretty good and seemed intent on giving us a good show even though it was just me and my girlfriend, and the food was good. Not \"best thing in the world\" good, but good. I got some steak and scallop dish and my girlfriend got swordfish. As I said, the steak and scallops were good, tasty, but nothing too special about them. My girlfriend's swordfish seemed rather dry, but I've never had swordfish before so I have no point of reference.  Seeing the place, I can kind of understand how they might get overwhelmed when they're full, considering the place has at least 3 floors of seating, but my experience was positive. It should be noted that I came with a Groupon. I'm not a particularly affluent college student so this place probably would have been out of my price range without the Groupon, so I can't exactly speak to whether I feel full price would have still been worth it. I just had a positive, filling experience, which is enough to get a positive rating and recommendation from me."}
{"text":"Bought the groupon and still lost money. Fine print doesn't tell you that 18% gratuity is included with the groupon!!! So two hibachi meals already equal 50 bucks so you're screwed right there. The service was terrible the food was for dogs and the drinks were made by the bus boy. I will never go here again might even protest outside. Save your money."}
{"text":"First time and last time here. We sit down and the first thing our waitress says is \"Were you at a rave?\" Wearing fishnet stockings she was a little inappropriate and very awkward. Reading the menu realized everything was very overpriced compared to other sushi places in many different cities. When our food came out the sushi was NOT fresh! I've head better from a super market! We were told we can't have a side of fried rice! We paid $25 for a $50 gift card and it wasn't even worth $25! Will never be coming back here!"}
{"text":"I normally don't criticize places and keep experiences in perspective and with that in mind, this was the worst service that I've experienced in years. Reservations for 12 were made 3 weeks ago, confirmed 3 times, including earlier that morning for 8:30p on Saturday night. After waiting 30 minutes, 2 within our party had separately asked the hostess when we would be seated and received different excuses.    With time to kill, I wanted to explore the other levels. The 2nd floor was closed. 3rd floor had the hookah lounge, and I sat down at the bar up there with louder house music in the background. I had a drink up there, a pretty weak gin and tonic for $5, with good service from the bartender. Came back down, we were still waiting. Finally seated at our 2 adjacent hibachi grills, 60+ minutes after our scheduled reservations.   Hoped things would be better ? No.  We waited several minutes for our server to arrive, received water and asked for drink orders. We ordered a $50 bottle of red wine, a couple mixed drinks, and sodas for the 6 at our table. 10 minutes pass and don't see our server. She arrived, sheepishly apologized, said couldn't find the bottle, we ordered another. At that point, I overhear a different server profusely apologizing  about the service to an adjacent table on the other side of us, stating he was working tables across 3 floors. I look over at the brewing conversion, make eye contact with one of the patrons at that table, and replies back \"you'll be screwed\".    Waited again for 10 more minutes with no sight of our server (at least the other server filled our water glasses as we grew restless), we had enough. 3 of us, 2 each with 5+ years in the industry went to speak to a manager. She apologized, and promised to bring one of the ordered bottles and to comp us a round of drinks.   Highlight of the night: Incredulous, I ended up going to the Map Room, betting myself that I could finish a drink there before I'd receive mine at Tomo. I arrived at map room just in time to watch Kyrie win the final round of the 3point all-star contest, have a drink, receive great service, all within 10 minutes.   I arrived back at Tomo, with my drink waiting for me for about a minute or 2; the other table still hadn't received their drinks yet (!) as the hibachi chefs arrive for each of our tables.   Our chef itself was engaging and a nice, great guy, one of the only bright spots of the night. The food wasn't bad either, standard hibachi fare from what I've experienced going to hibachis once or twice a year. $20-$30 for a hibachi order of veggies, scallops, chicken, or salmon along with miso soup. Our other table didn't even receive their miso soup until their hibachi was already !   A hibachi along in 5 floors in a beautiful building would have been excellent addition to the Warehouse District. Unfortunately, this place just failed and gives Cleveland downtown dining a bad reputation."}
{"text":"Great service, staff and owner was really nice and welcoming! Love the hookah and happy hour prices"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 9 pm. They couldn't get us at a hibachi table like we wanted but they said we could get hibachi at a regular table. They kept lying to us by telling us our food would be out soon. An hour and a half later, they still didn't begin cooking our food. The poor waiter was embarrassed. The hostess was condescending and made us feel worse. My daughter started crying because she was so hungry. We ended up leaving and eating somewhere else at 10:30 at night. This was the worst managed restaurant I have ever been to! Don't go!"}
{"text":"I didn't get to try their sushi, but their hibachi was okay. I expected a better experience, and larger servings though. Their chefs put on a show with random pop culture references, but hearing the same idiotic phrases repeatedly got pretty annoying after a while. I would have liked to talk to my neighbors without having a screaming Beyonce impersonation in my face."}
{"text":"I'm always excited to find Japanese restaurants that serve Hibachi style dishes but unfortunately, this was horrible.  The main reason I ordered is because I love fried rice with yum-yum sauce on top. I ordered a Hibachi meal then a large side of fried rice. Each 2oz cup of yum-yum sauce was $1 & no sides even came with the meal (overpriced compared to others) and the rice was HARD. All of it. And when I say hard, I mean it was cooked hours earlier and sat in a warming tray so it could overcook. It was literally so hard that I couldn't bite into it. I tried picking out the crunchy rice parts to make it edible until realizing it was ALL the rice.  I ended up making my own rice to use the $5 of yum-yum sauce I bought but that was a disappointment as well. All 5 cups of sauce were not only CURDLED, but had pieces of other foods floating in it. One cup had a large, soft white chunk in it (I couldn't figure out what it was). One had a piece of lettuce, one had other unknown pieces in it.   Literally all the food I bought went straight into the garbage. Even the salad had brown lettuce. What gets me is these people packing up the food SEE THE POOR QUALITY but give it to you anyways. Because of this, I had to write a review warning others as I will never try this \"food\" again."}
{"text":"So table was not ready at our reservation no big deal went to bar and waited.     Service was beyond slow took forever to get drinks or order food.  Wait time to get sushi appetizer was quick.  Sushi off chef special menu was good but not worth up charge price.  Took forever to get a chef to our table we had to ask twice.  Again surprised because it did not look that busy.    Chefs at hibachi usually ask if anyone has request or allergens did not bother doing this when he did come.  Food was cooked well just seemed like they cook slower than benihana or Wasabi for example as no food came out even close together.  Food did taste great no complaints there.   Also pretty sure the \"sake\" they give you in a ketchup bottle is the same stuff they clean the table with.  pretty sure if it was something expensive they wouldn't have left the bottle with the table for free.     Manager seemed disinterested when we asked a question and had a concern, guess I won't bother coming back.  Shame good food ruined by bad service."}
{"text":"So... I give this two stars because I am obsessed with rice. Some people love music, some people love dogs, but I love rice.... and the rice here was so sad and bland that my heart ached for it. I ordered the hibachi chicken, the broth stuff was yummy, the salad made me smile... but then the rice entered my mouth and killed me inside. I will say that the staff was FANTASTIC! The hostess Michelle and I bonded over our first names (great parents think alike), and our waiter was super nice. 5 star staff with 2 star rice. I would give the rice 1 star but it was still rice, so I'll give it some credit."}
{"text":"On my daughter's 9th Birthday, she wanted hibachi and sushi. Since we live downtown, we decided to try Tomo even though it only had 3 stars on Yelp. They were FANTASTIC!! They treated her like she was a princess, the food was awesome, and the service was great!! I could not be more satisfied."}
{"text":"Disappointed with misleading menu. We went for lunch and got the three roll lunch special that came with miso soup. It was a surprise to have mushroom soup come out, no dashi, no tofu, just a dark sour broth with mushrooms and poorly fried chunks of possibly onions. Not to mention, even those toppings were lacking... I had 6 slices of mushrooms. Not exactly the type of soup you would expect.  When the sushi came out I again was underwhelmed. The rice was undercooked and the fish was lacking in flavor. I had tuna, yellowtail and salmon and had a hard time differentiating flavors.  Beyond the food, our server was unprofessional and only offered the soup portion of the lunch special to the other person at my table and I had to chime in that we were ordering the same deal and whether or not I got the choice or soup or salad as well. He rushed our order asking if we ready to order immediately upon seating us and asked if we were finished only a few pieces into the meal.  Subpar sushi experience at best and there was only one other table in the entire restaurant so I find that inexcusable."}
{"text":"Great food and service! There's a hookah lounge upstairs that is clubby but fun. People there are super enthusiastic and care about your experience. I'd totally go back!"}
{"text":"Man, I really hate to leave this review but my god the fried rice was horrible. I ordered the beef fried rice which is over priced at $17, I expected there would be veggies and beef...no veggies really poor cut of beef and some rice that tasted like it was cook on fermented raw fish or something. It was a taste I cannot even explain. Usually if I get fried rice and it's not great I'll just take it home and add and egg or maybe some veggies and toss it up in a pan to make a good round 2 experience, I literally just threw the rice in the trash after two bites. I don't know if the beef was expired or the cooking surface had fish past on it or what but it was inedible. What a bummer. I will say the salad was ok and the soup was pretty good so at least it wasn't a totally loss. Needless to say, I will never eat or order food from there again."}
{"text":"Food was good and the hibachi guy was awesome! However, we had a 7pm reservation and we didn't leave until after 10pm. We also got seated in the basement and it was super hot down there. The service was slow and it's hard to wait until 8:30 to get food. They kept saying \"the hibachi chefs will be down shortly because it's really busy upstairs\". When we asked for our checks, he came really quick than disappeared. Our friend had to go upstairs to take our checks up to the front desk to get them taken care of. Once our friend had given the hostess our checks, her response was \"oh your waiter is busy\". What?! I don't think I'll be returning here. The service wasn't what I expected for an establishment in the location it is in & for the prices I paid. Feel free to come eat here if you want to spend 3-4 hours of your life waiting on dinner."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a large group last night and it was a comedy of errors from start to finish. I worked in the industry for a decade, so I typically extend a great deal of patience and understanding for mistakes, but this experience was inexcusable. The food would have been pretty good if it wasn't overcooked. The service? Ha! Terrible. The only exception was the bus staff that was hard working and attentive. Everyone else - including management - was totally clueless.   Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"The Indian roll is GOOD. The service was excellent and sitting down on a Saturday night at 7 was quick. Their upstairs hookah club didn't start until 10PM EST though..."}
{"text":"I only had take out delivered so I don't have a review on atmosphere but the sushi was just O.K. in my opinion. The prices were a bit higher  for the quality of sushi and it had a very fishy aftertaste. My friends ordered hibachi and said that it was pretty good. There are some other sushi places downtown that I enjoy more and have better pricing."}
{"text":"I visited Tomo for the second time on Saturday night, and I believe it will be for the last time.  We had reservations but our entire party has not arrived yet so the hostess suggested we wait at the bar.  It appeared to be well stocked, but the bartender seemed to be working on one speed:  slow and disinterested. A waiter, waiting for his cocktails for service, even apologized to us for the wait.  After the bartender finished with him, he wiped the bar and averted his eyes to every place he could, except to us.  One person in our party finally got his attention to order a saki.  (Awful and served too hot.)  By that time I wasn't interested in dealing with him, even for a cocktail on Saturday night.  Mr. Disinterested Bartender wasn't pleased with that either.    The rest of our party arrived to save us from the uncomfortable bar situation and we were seated at a hibachi table upstairs in what is a very nice dining room.    Our waiter was courteous.  Two guests wanted hibachi, the other three sushi, and soon our hibachi chef arrived to begin his preparations.  He was friendly, social, and funny.  The problem was we couldn't hear him at all because the very loud, fairly inappropriate (for a $$$ restaurant) music selections.  Open conversation with the chef or my companions in the restaurant was impossible with \"Cotton Eyed Joe\", \"American Soldier\", and \"Take Me Home Country Roads\" obliterating any and all other sound.  Seems no one there is familiar with the concept of ambient music.  A little bit of \"Buddha Bar\" would go a long way here, guys.  The sushi was average at best.  The quality of the fish used for the sashimi we ordered seemed sub par.but the cost was right up there with premium sashimi.  I can't say how the shrimp and salmon hibachi was for sure, but I can say neither of my friends commented it was delicious.       The novelty alone of visiting a sushi restaurant housed in what was a bath house isn't enough to make me want to return.  If yelp had a 1.5 star rating, that's what it would earn.  I wish I could say, domo arigato, Tomo.    But all I can say is, sayonara."}
{"text":"Waitress was a doll, food is better at chain, Benihana. I'm sorry to say! It was too expensive. Rice was too salty and veggies are made better at home by my husband. I feel mean saying that but it needs to step it up."}
{"text":"Great Date NIGHT(09/6/14)! Our Hibachi Chef got everyone tipsy before the meal with sake with his tactics. The group sitting next to us kept stealing his attention from our group because they wanted to join in on the fun. We were having so much fun that the Manager had to tell the Chef to quiet down with his signing R&B/ POP. One of the most memorable experiences I have ever had.   Oh yeah, the food was good too! Loved the Philly Roll (had them fried it), Shrimp was great, Chicken(grilled) was a little too salty for my taste; however, my date ate mines so it couldn't been too bad. We left tipsy and full!   I also used a living social deal, so between the free liquor (sake), drinks, food. Our bill was 72-50(LS)=22 not including the well deserved tip!"}
{"text":"Service was horrendous. Our server had no idea what he was doing. We did the hibachi and never got soup or salad, took 25 minutes for drinks to arrive, and another 15 for the check. Upon  receiving the check there was 18% gratuity already included. Never an apology for no soup or salad. Amateur hour all around."}
{"text":"First time there and first time at a hibachi table. Both were amazing. Food was great and the chef was very fun and engaged the table. I will recommend to my friends for sure"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Owners are so nice! I would recommend anyone to come here! Food was amazing and the sushi was by far the best in the land!"}
{"text":"I am somewhat of a sushi snob and I compare all sushi to Ginko in Tremont. This place didn't even make the charts! The salmon and tuna both looked exactly the same. It was clear the fish had been ground into a paste with what they called spicy mayo. It actually made us sick. The only good thing we had was the shrimp tempura (hard to mess up fried shrimp!). Will never return for sushi"}
{"text":"Tomo gives you a chance to pick your seating type. We chose to sit at the Hibachi Grill which was fun. Everyone gets started off with sumashi soup and salad. All meals also come with fried rice and vegetables (e.g., zucchini, mushrooms, onions). The salad was really good - the cucumbers tasted really fresh. The dressing was good, though a bit watery, but that didn't detract from the flavor. There are lots of combination entrees to pick from in terms of what meat you get for dinner. I chose chicken and shrimp and liked the latter best.   Before starting the Hibachi experience we started with sushi. There is a large sushi menu. You have all your basic rolls and many, many specialty options. We started with a Spicy Girl Roll which I enjoyed and again I found tasted really fresh.   The chef that came to our table was a good cook and friendly. He wasn't as big into performing as some chef's are, but he did do all the typical tricks and skill demonstrations you'd expect. While we also had a server, the chef also asked if anyone needed anything before he left. Our server was attentive and friendly and quick on clearing soup/salad plates away. The server's overall demeanor contributed positively to the experience.   I thought the interior space was really cool too. The decor is highly themed, but it works. The space is divided into a few hibachi grill areas, a sushi raw bar, a regular bar with hookah and then just regular dining tables, at which you can also order the hibachi grill items. I would never have expected to find all this inside of the simple W 9th storefront. There's also a lounge upstairs I didn't get to visit.   This was a relatively fast dinner, but a fun end to the day. I will certainly keep this place in mind. This is a great thing to have in downtown Cleveland - gone are the drives to the suburbs for good hibachi."}
{"text":"This is my favorite hibachi restaurant located in Cleveland. You always receive large portions of rice and vegetables. Which means I usually end up with leftovers! All of the cooks that I have had have been amazing and really entertaining.  But, some of the downsides. Service can be spotty. The first time I went the restaurant was barely full so we received great service. However, my second time there seemed to be only one waitress for two of the grills. Due to this it took a while for us to get normal paced service. Additionally, for the salad if you do not like the house dressing you are out of options. Last time I went we took my mom who has some severe allergies. Due to this she could not have the house salad. She requested ranch instead, but was told shortly after they did not have any other dressing. So, my mom did not receive a salad.   Despite some of the issues I would still go back. If there is an issue the staff tries to make up for it. Like when they did not have one of the beers that we had request they provided another drink for free."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Didn't even try the food as the waiter spilled sake on me, argued with me, and we left before anything we ordered came out due to attitude.  Management attempted to handle the situation but damage was done.  Shame, because I have eaten here before,  my friends come in large groups all the time- I just will not be joining them."}
{"text":"The food was really tasty and our waitress was friendly last night. We sat at the hibachi table and order drinks. The hibachi was so good and had a different seasoned taste than what I am used to. It was a little sweet and that was yummy. We did not know until the end that the happy hour drink specials did not apply, unless you sat at the bar. That was a big disappointment, but I still had a great birthday here at Tomo."}
{"text":"Beautifully prepared sushi tastes as good as it looks. Menu includes Japanese apps, entrees, sashimi and sushi, as well as Hibachi entrees.   Specialty drinks are delicious. Beer and wine choices are available, tho no local brews. Our waitress was very attentive. When making a reservation choose Hibachi or regular table."}
{"text":"I was going Gangnam Style.   Actually, our chef was going Gangnam Style, singing the song and waving his knives around.  These guys not only embrace cultural jokes, but run with them (in a good way).  We went to Tomo after getting a Groupon and no, we didn't make reservations.  It wasn't a problem, we sat at the bar for about 10 minutes and were able to be sat at one of the \"entertainment\" seats.    The bartender, bless her soul, was probably hired on her looks instead of her apt bartending abilities.  First they were out of ginger beer (gasp!), but the drinks she made were fine.  It just took forever to get them and then to close out our tab when we moved to a table.  As for the hibachi, no complaints here!  Our chefs were Beninhana styled jokesters.  Keeping us laughing and engaged from soup to Hibachi.  It probably didn't hurt that they were shooting saki in our mouths the whole time either!    The food seemed fresh and was diced and tossed and played with great skill!  We got the chicken and shrimp as well as the Tomo Special (ahem, thanks to my boyfriend who always orders the most expensive thing on the menu when I'm paying!).  It was all great!  I'd probably skip the chicken, just because the shrimp was to die for, and holy moly was that lobster and steak good ( I did at least get a taste).  Their secret mayo/pink sauce, I couldn't get enough of it either!    So even though our bill wasn't cheap, we had a great time!  I want to come back and bring a big group because the Saki fights were getting pretty intense - but I\"m sure my friends could keep the game up!"}
{"text":"Appetizers were alright; Jalepeno hamachi was good, tofu was over battered. Sushi was tasty but over priced for size and cuts. Got steak and scallop Hibachi and it was not impressive, 2 oz of over cooked steak and 2 large scallops cut into 5 small pieces, best part was vegetables. Soup and salad that comes with hibachi was good and the choice of udon noodle instead of rice was a nice option. Overall nothing tastes bad, but I know better Japanese food for less.  Strange side note: they have hookah here. This can be good or bad depending on your taste. They were smoking hookah in the main dining and also on the out door patio. By the way; hookah at a Japanese place? WHY?"}
{"text":"Uh, is this a restaurant, a bar, or a nightclub?  The night I was here people were finishing up their meals while we were having a drink and a DJ was spinning music to an empty dance floor.  I walked out very, very confused.  It sounds like each floor is supposed to host a different type of atmosphere but I guess I just wasn't digging it that night.  Maybe I'll give it a second chance??"}
{"text":"Sushi was great! The special rolls are really good. Service was ok. A little expensive for some of the sushi rolls. Would go again though."}
