{"text":"Owner was so disrespectful, unprofessional and rude. She made me feel unwelcome and didn't care for my satisfaction. It all started by giving me the wrong order and not making the tacos to my satisfaction. Instead of making things right she gave me attitude and made ugly faces. On top of all that I waiting for a whole hour for food. I do not recommend this place!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Want to eat the same tacos al pastor that you would find in Mexico City or Puebla? This is the place to eat the tastiest tacos in Phoenix. Cemita al pastor is my all time favorite."}
{"text":"Delicious carne and quesadillas. Bring a friend who speaks Spanish if you go during the day."}
{"text":"This is a little dive in an iffy neighborhood that serves amazing mexican street food.  They don't have an extensive menu but you will be happy with your choices regardless of what you pick.  My favorite is tacos al pastor which I asked to be served with flour tortillas versus the customary corn tortillas.  The pork was tender and plentiful. They also have \"Cabeza\" or head tacos.  I imagine this is the cheek area of the animal which is so treasured by high level chefs in expensive restaurants so don't be put off by it.  I tried one and it is like eating very, very tender beef.  Not sure if it was pork or beef but it was tasty.  With your order of tacos you get two choices of spicy sauce (green and red).  I loved them both.  They give you sautéed onions, slices of cucumber, slices of radish, and grilled jalapeños.  I think I paid $5 for two and they were large and full of meat.  The place is super clean and the service is friendly.  I have been here twice and will continue my patronage as long as the food is fresh, tasty, and well-priced."}
{"text":"Dust off your Spanish and stroll in for some great Mexican Street Food! This place has it all and make sure you get there early so you can try their special items before the run out!  It can be a bit noisy (very loud) if they have the tunes cranking, but hey thats Mexico for ya, not a bad thing, to me it makes the experience ever more authentic.  The prices are very reasonable and the staff is friendly, this is nothing fancy, so don't expect some type of chain taco joint. Its the real deal coming from someone who is in Mexico every month!"}
{"text":"Tacos de pastorare really good , the meat is fresh and lots of flavor . The taco de Cabeza was alright . Great price for the tacos !!"}
{"text":"Esperar 40 minutos  por dos tacos y una semita??? Y despues de que la traen  El pan esta duro ...le sirvieron  a otras mesas que llegaron despues de mi . La Peor experiencia en una,taqueria, El sevicio  al cliente esta pesimo , no lo recomiendo a nadie. 10,26,16"}
{"text":"Came to this spot based on the reviews. The food was so-so. It was pretty busy considering it was a Monday and there was only one waitress and one guy making the tacos. I was really hoping that this place would serve delicious tacos (which are hard to come by!) but unfortunately didn't live up to other Yelpers hype. The lady was nice and I guess this would be a place that one could visit after a drunken night...unfortunately sober self won't be back anytime soon... :("}
{"text":"The food was okay but the service made it NOT worth it. The lady at the register was EXTREMELY RUDE. Definitely not coming back. If service is important to you, go get tacos somewhere else. They're not that great."}
{"text":"Nothing better than late night tacos at this place !! I tried carne asada  y pastor tacos!! Yummmmm"}
{"text":"From reading the reviews here I see everyone but a couple of people missing out on what to really eat here.  Have the al pastor alambre.  They give you like 10 street taco sized tortillas and you run out of them before you run out of meat.  Better words you get 10 or more unbelievable street tacos for $8.00."}
{"text":"Estos son los mejores tacos que hasta ahora he comido en phoenix , los tacos del trompo son deliciosos sus salsas están muy buenas y su servicio es rápido y eficaz."}
{"text":"If your looking for authentic Mexican food,look no farther! This is about the closest thing your gonna find in America to true Mexican food,period! When I put the beans in my mouth and close my eyes, I actually feel like I'm in Mexico and I myself feel a little Mexican for a moment. I think they must make the beans daily,the old fashioned way! They are so good! The people here are also great! I will eat here again based on the same great experiences I've had over the past nine times of coming here! The great service is consistent and authentic as well. I will be going here on a regular and recommending them to friends and family."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews. I decided to make the trip from Surprise, to Phoenix. For the Tacos de Pastor ( Mexican marinated pork ) I read expecting them to be an exceptional experience. I must say I was disappointed. I must say I have tasted better in my city. Waldos tacos by far are better and they are a food truck. The staff and service was on par no complaints . Would probably not drive so far to return."}
{"text":"Wow, this was delicious! I had the asada Alambres - a steak fajita kind of dinner. Just really yummy spices, lots of meat, cheese and veggies. Lots of food for a decent price! We will definitely come again next time we're in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Street tacos are always hot fresh and delicious!!!  Very affordable as well no frills kind of place"}
{"text":"Just gunna say first my best friend loves this place. For me though i went there with my family last night and ordered a burrito with carne asada, beans, cheese, sour cream, and tomatoes. What i got was a tortilla with carne asada my wife spoke to the lady who took the order so the lady brought it back when i got the burrito back all that was on it extra was cheese my family had finished eating was ready to go and burrito was cold carne tortilla it was not great. Got the bill and noticed i was charged extra for the cream and tomatoes which i never got i payed the bill and decided this resturaunt is not for me. Horrible service, horrible food, and 9.00 for a shrimpy burrito with just a touch of carne asada and a pinch of cheese. I wont ever go here again. I suggest if you want something you want in a burrito go somewhere else. If you want only what they wanna give you in a burrito go to don betos. Its just not for me."}
{"text":"The best carne asada tacos I've eaten so far!! They are a must try if you have not already and they are very affordable. They are actually cheaper then where I used to go and taste better."}
{"text":"Try the specials, solid tacos and fast service. At nights you can get down on pool or karaoke.  Full range of Mexican sodas and beers. Tv for the kids and plenty of elbow room to relax. Try it on your way home in night you'll find yourself out that way more often."}
{"text":"The tacos are really good, I would give this place 5 stars but I felt like the portions of the side dishes were a bit small but still delicious."}
{"text":"Now this place wuz bomb!! Fast & friendly service. Only 1 waitress but she does good. The carne asada & El pastor wuz delicious."}
{"text":"Great taco place.....not much of a meat selection but the tacos are great!!! Waitress is super nice."}
{"text":"If your hungry for cheap eats and that is tasty, this is the place to be. The al pastor was tasty along with the buns that accompanied it. All together I spent $10.31 for an al pastor torta along with a plate. The cook is not shy when it comes to giving you a fair amount of meat. This place definitely had me full. Definitely recommend when looking for a great taco shop. I have to try this late as they are open till 2am on the weekends."}
{"text":"This is about as authentic Mexican food as you can find. Excellent Pastol & Asada tacos and at a great price! And of course, a good selection of cervezas! Very clean and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place out last night. I ordered two asada tacos and one al pastor. The al pastor tacos really good but the carne asada was a bit Bland unfortunately, was not expecting that. They do pack the tacos real good with meat, onion and cilantro. They're dark red salsa is so good, they also have a green avocado salsa that's pretty good too but that goes better with like pollo asado or something which they don't have. Beer is also served. I will try the place out again next time hopefully the meat is a lot tastier."}
{"text":"The best place to eat ever! they have what you can call a carne azada sandwich with a special bread that tastes between ciabatta and french bread, with cheese avocado and salsa, they also have tacos, quesadillas and THE BEST PART OF ALL TACOS ARABES!!!! you cannot find these any other place in Arizona, believe me I have searched. Oh and the best part, my family of 5 (if I do take out) can eat for less than $20... yes clean, tasty, great service and affordable. MY FAVORITE PLACE TO EAT FOR SURE.  PS it is open till very late too"}
{"text":"Very good street food. Busy on a Sunday night. Great price for the quality/amount! Service was friendly and fast. They also had a busy takeout section. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"The building is an old Mexican market /carniceria.. The music is loud but the food is fresh and delish .. No wait for a table (mid-week), my order was in two minutes after I walked in and food was delivered quick!  I got a taco sampler.. One of each.. Carne asada. Cabeza. Al pastor.. The meat in each taco was nicely seasoned and moist.. The plate they bring you with sliced radishes, jalapeño, limes and cucumbers was an added bonus.   The guy that supplies the horchata and Jamaica wasn't in yet, when I stopped by at lunch time.. Maybe next time.. I will be back .."}
{"text":"I was really impressed by the food. Great carne Asada and the burrito was very well portioned(size and item wise). Some places put way too much onion/cilantro or not enough steak to beans rice. The rice and beans were great, simple yet delicious. Comes with avacado freshly scooped out. Asked to add white cheese but might come standard. 5 bucks... Add 1.50 for bottle coke. Can't really beat that price, especially for taste.  Fair warning, they don't speak the best of English(but enough), know your order in Spanish for best results. However items on the menu they know the translation. Friend only eats ground beef for teeth reasons, the couldn't understand ground and I didn't know it. They only have shredded and Asada. But she got everything else.  Still 5 star taste and quantity for price. Might not be best ever or in town but definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I like their tacos, specially the pastor meat tacos. I did not appreciate them charging us extra for our credit card usage. Service is ok!"}
{"text":"Came here because I had a restaurant.com gift certificate to spend $20 and take $10. Upon arrival it looked like we were pulling up to a liquor store, dont let the outside fool you!    First thing I asked was if the certificate was valid the looked clueless and said no that it was not when clearly all their information was on the certificate. Since I was limited on cash I decide to try the tacos anyway. I ordered 2 adobada tacos that cost $1.75 each they were pretty good as they can get in phoenix. Would be coming back for these tacos for sure. But they need to get with the times and update their coupons as it can bring more customers in would of gave them a better rating if they took the certificate as I would of ordered more food lol."}
{"text":"This is a must have if you are looking for a legit taqueria! Bring your Spanish and be ready for the best , freshest tacos.  Has beer and Mexican sodas to compliment. Already craving my next visit and haven't even left."}
{"text":"When I first pulled into this parking lot, I was afraid that I might get robbed LOL! No doubt it isn't located in the best of neighborhood. However, I will take that risk again just to eat their tacos. When we first arrived, they looked at me like I was lost. After the rest of the parties arrived (and they can speak Spanish), they took my order through my friends and everything was all good. Their tacos are definitely out of the world. They are cheap, delicious, juicy and came with lots of size delicious that you can get over and over again. If you like authentic tacos like I do, this is the place to go."}
