{"text":"This restaurant was great. We came in with reservations, and we were seated. The menu had lots of veg and non veg items. And everything on the menu looked good. Our food came quick and the prices were great!"}
{"text":"Decent Indian food. My husband and I are rather obsessed with malai kofta... we don't particularly like the version here. (Full disclosure, though: we moved here from Boston and think we found the Platonic ideal malai kofta at a restaurant up there. I'm not sure anything else will ever measure up. But this didn't.) Naan was good, and they were nice to our kids. Parking can be a hassle if you go when Mad Mex is busy."}
{"text":"Best Indian cuisine in the area. Always enjoy eating at Tamarind. The staff is outstanding!  Today we ordered chicken tikka masala and paneer saag with garlic naan. Definitely was not disappointed. The garlic naan was hot and smothered in butter with a perfect amount of garlic. Would definitely recommend to others in the area looking for a nice Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Lamb curry, chicken seekh kabab, pakoda and vada are good. Disappointed on Chicken biriyani, fish curry and other stuff. Can be better. Ambience is good."}
{"text":"My most favorite place to eat. The service is terrific. They really aim to please. Paneer Tikki Masala is my favorite. They make a wonderful, smoky buttered naan. My kids love the Mango Lassi. We crave this food when we are not there."}
{"text":"Kodi vepudu... Is my favourite... will never miss to order. Overall I love the food taste here.."}
{"text":"I was visiting family in Bridgeville, PA. I like the food specially the bread basket, mixed grill. Being from around Chicago, IL I like the variety in menu and bold spices jn their dishes. Definitely a place to visit if you like good indian food."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I loved it. It was literally one of the best authentic Indian restaurants we've been to. The location of this place is awesome. It's a little gem up this hill on greentree road. The server was awesome. He took his time and very specifically described each dish we were interested in. Plus the shirts they wore had a quote on the back that read \"Keep calm and curry on\" which I thought was great. We ended up starting with the assorted veggie sampler which had the best pakora I've ever tasted. The my girlfriend got the Malai Kofta and I got the Kadai Paneer. They were both fantastic. Mine was kind of spicy actually really spicy and the server asked if we wanted yogurt for the spice and we said no but he brought it anyway. It was a spectacular experience and the food was so tasty. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. We had samosas, Chicken Tikka Masala, and Chilly Chicken (not sure if it was a typo on the menu) with garlic naan. Unlike most other Indian restaurants I've been to, they don't ask you how spicy you want things. The Chilly Chicken was very spicy, and the Tikka Masala was mildly spicy.   We'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"This is probably the best in town!  I rate based on 3 major criteria's - 1. Taste 2. Service 3. Ambience (covers cleanliness)  These guys get full marks on Taste and Service!   Service is quick. Servers would help you out with options available if you're not sure of what to have or what's the portion size.  I've had chicken appetizers, Dosas, Base Bali Bath, Biryani, Indo-Chinese and deserts! Per my experience it's very difficult to get these dishes close to what it tastes in India in authentic restaurant. But, these guys do a good job!  I deducted 1 star for ambience as I see a scope of improvement there!"}
{"text":"Best dosa ever. Bisibele bath is my favorite. They make yummy cakes too. Good service with reasonable price . Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Had a great time here! After not knowing they were closed on Mondays, I visited the next day, and have to say I was impressed! Although small inside and a little dark, the waitstaff more than made up for it! Friendly, outgoing, and prompt. Now for the food, I had the Gongura Lamb, samosa and regular Naan. All were great! The Gonrua had just the right amount of spice mixed with sour Gongura leaf, awesome flavor, and the lamb was so tenderit practically fell apart on its own. The samosa was equally as good. Now the Naan, was probably the best i've ever had! I just wish I actually lived here so I could way more often! :)"}
{"text":"First time here--nice seating arrangement and beautiful decor.  Paneer tikka masala, veg sampler, naan were all delicious and fresh. Dining companion got a thali which was not on the menu, but loved. Try their fresh mango lassi and eggless cakes! Two things not loved were how slow service was at times and that their Yelp offer could not be used after 6 pm (stated nowhere)."}
{"text":"I am an Indian myslef and i believe this is hands down the Best Indian food in and around Pittsburgh. !!"}
{"text":"I sampled food from Tamarind at a local fundraising event and was instantly hooked.  Tonight I went to the restaurant in hopes of eating what I had sampled and was pleasantly overwhelmed by their large menu.  I ended up getting the Paneer Masala which was different than what I was looking for but it was just as good! We also tried the plain naan in addition to the lamb naan. Both were delicious!  The service was great and our waiter was very friendly.  I will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Super   Prompt service  Good ambience  Melodious songs  Nice selection   Caution to non local  Google or any maps will tell that you reach. Destination while you are on green tree road  You need to take driveway uphill  hotel is in small strip mall then"}
{"text":"Spicy and authentic. When half or more of the clientele  in an indian restaurant are indian... they do something right. I had the chicken vindaloo and it was amazing. Actually spicy! Mopped up the sauce with garlic naan and enjoyed every drop."}
{"text":"Solid appetizers, fish was fresh and flavorful. Naan was average. The meat in the goat curry was not the best quality (lots of fatty and throwaway pieces) but the gravy itself was good."}
{"text":"Very good food. Very friendly staff . Prompt service and smiling faces. Idli was soft and food was hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Authentic Indian food. Spicy for anyone who has not tried Indian food before. We loved it. We had the buffet on a weekend afternoon and it was great."}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Excellent food. We had the lunch special (non vegetarian), chicken dosa, raita and gulab jamun. Big portions. Very filling. Very reasonably priced.  The restaurant wasn't too full, so the service/timing was great."}
{"text":"I've had Indian all over the world, and tried just about every one in Pittsburgh. Tamarind is by far the best. Friendly staff and large portions. Buffet is good, but ordering off of the menu is better. The samosas and chicken vindaloo are excellent."}
{"text":"Not bad Indian food, but not among the best I've had in Pittsburgh. I have no specific complaints about the food (other than the buffet-level spiciness, see below) but nothing was stellar. If I lived near here, I'd probably go back on occasion, but wouldn't make a long drive.  Important note: I was eating from a 30-person buffet, which partially mirrored the main buffet outside the party room. So I'll blame the fact that everything was bland on the please-everyone approach to spiciness (read: no spicy)..."}
{"text":"We don't have a lot of good Indian food where I live so when I was visiting some friends and we were wondering where to get dinner, I suggested Indian food. My friends picked this place in particular because they wanted to try a new restaurant, plus this place has dosas, a South Indian food which I guess not every Indian restaurant serves. I'd never had it before, it's kind of like a savory pancake, wrapped around delicious stuffings.   We got dosas, idly, gobi manchurian, naan, chicken korma, lamb saag, gongura chicken and chicken tikka masala. All the food was fantastic, we all enjoyed it very much and stuffed ourselves. I also got a mango lassi, which was very tasty.   The staff was very friendly, service was fairly quick, and the restaurant was nice and well-kept. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ate here twice (don't ask me why i went here twice - when the first time itself was quite disappointing. Suffice to say, there was a girl involved)  Go here for buffet, only if you like south indian cuisine, which is in the average to good  range.   If you like north indian food, best to avoid this place altogether. For whatever reason, most north india dishes taste as if they have ketchup in them here. Food is unnecessarily spicy.  Avoid...Bad Indian Food."}
{"text":"We had dined at this restaurant several times and mostly enjoyed the food. However, I take out experience was a complete disaster. We called and ordered our meals and was told it would be 30 minutes. I waited almost 45 minutes before arriving at the restaurant and then had to sit there for an additional half an hour before my food is ready. Other then apologizing, it was no attempt to explain, to rectify, or to somehow make this a better experience. I kept being told to just take a seat and wait. When I arrived home, only one dish was hot. All of the other dishes, appetizers and dosas, were ice cold. The ratings are for our dining experience. Our take-out experience would've been a half star."}
{"text":"The restaurant closes after lunch, and reopens at 5 for dinner.  Nothing negative, but certainly useful information.  Great South Indian fare.  The idli and dosa's are really some of the best I have had since Edison, NJ!  Not bad at all!  Ambiance is decent, nothing WOW-like, but the service is commendable.  Go if you want good south Indian for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat!  The food is always fantastic, I've tried the majority of entrees on the menu.  Wait staff is attentive and efficient, keeping your beverage glass full & checking in to see if there are any extra needs.  Only complaints are: the spice level I request is usually very different from what I receive (I get milder when I requested spicy) & the place could use a good scrubbing.  But, the food is consistently wonderful, spicy or not - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I go back and forth on how I feel about Tamarind.  I love their Chicken Tikka Masala and their Samosas.  Delicious.  That's pretty much what I get every time.  When I deviate from that, it's hit or miss for me.  With that said, everyone I've ever taken there has liked it.  The vibe of the place itself is nice.  There's always some entertaining Indian music video airing in the back corner, and the tables are nice.  Portions are generous, and there's always leftovers for the next day.  (Nom!)  However - and this is a big however:  The employees are really unfriendly.  Like, unfriendly to the point where I wonder if I'm supposed to apologize for coming in to patronize their establishment.  Combine that with the extremely high prices, and I come away feeling a little fleeced.    If Udipi were close enough to order from all the time, I probably wouldn't go to Tamarind again.  Alas..."}
{"text":"Dosas to die for. Been here three times. In restaurant, Buffet and take away.  It's always delicious and great gluten free and vegetarian options"}
{"text":"Food was passable, the dishes were dirty, the glasses were dirty, and the food seemed like it came out of a plastic container in a fridge and just got microwaved, and the staff seemed so busy even though no one was in the restaurant, it seemed like they wanted to close early. Overall if you want Indian and have nowhere else to go, then go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Pittsburgh.  No doubt.  spices are used properly."}
{"text":"Out of 5:  3.0 - chicken chittenado: slow burn 3.5 - lamb Korma: creamy and light 3.5 - butinado: like an awesome bready poori  0.5 - service: extremely slow"}
{"text":"Last night we had a take out of Butter Chicken. I ordered it as medium spice. The butter chicken sauce tasted like sweet tomato sauce. It reminded me of panera bread tomato soup. It was that sweet. Tamarind used to have good delicious food. I don't mind paying more for delicious food but their quality has gone down. It's more expensive than other local establishment and food quality has degraded as well."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Indian place mostly because it's close-by and they have a bar. The food is good. The service can be quite hit or miss unfortunately."}
{"text":"Definitely worth a visit . Pretty authentic on couple of dishes , ambience can be improved on ."}
{"text":"Love the lunch thalis here. Nice and spicy with a solid selection of south indian fare. Also good for lunch on the weekends, though all they typically have is the buffet and no menu items. I enjoy their dosas and kormas. When the indian food craving hits you...this is the place, though not for north indian dishes. Don't plan any meetings right after lunch because the savory aromas stick with you and you sort of smell like the place for a bit. It's kid friendly too (they don't have crayons or anything, but you don't get any dirty looks either)."}
{"text":"Was there last Saturday and believe me it was wonderful delight. After long time we had so tasteful Indian food. Being Veggie we ordered all vegetarian dishes like Navratan, paneer tikka and they were tasty. Loved daal fry. Please note this review is for Vegetarian options. Experienced delayed service but good thing is person who takes order lets you know before hand how much time it will take, so no surprises."}
{"text":"Food takes so long. I went alone and there was no any other customers, I waited for 30 minutes for my food. I asked for spicy level 8 but came mild even after fixing it. The employees are so friendly but they will never visit your table or ask if you need something. Chicken tikka masala that I ordered had just few cubes of chicken, the rest was bell peppers and large cuts of onions.  Overall, there is better places to eat Indian food."}
{"text":"Some of the worst Indian food in the city!...  Everything is extremely terrible!... when I mentioned to the owner that the roti's were hard, he said it's very difficult to maintain quality of rotis in Pittsburgh weather!.. how on earth is that a valid justification, I can never tell!...  best to avoid this place at all costs!... there is a perfectly fine place down the street serving edible food!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, but be ready to wait.  They state it on the menu, and it was true; at least 20 minutes for our food, but worth the wait.  My daughter had the tiki masala and I had the vindaloo, and both were very tasty. The wait staff were extremely helpful in helping my daughter to select a dish that would not be too spicy.  Another key item to take note is that there were a great many local Indians that were eating there, which told me it would be quite authentic.  Portions were definitely large enough to fill us up.  Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Awful food. Butter chicken was artificially colored deep orange gravy stirred with hard stale chicken."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at the Tamarind on Greentree Rd. south of Pittsburgh.  I'll be the first to admit that I've never traveled to India, so I'm not qualified to judge whether this is authentic Indian cooking or not, but I do know delicious, tasty, fresh, well prepared food when it is served to me.  And this restaurant puts out some delicious food.  We had some appetizer sampler platters (both a vegetarian & non-vegetarian), as well as a curry dish, a biryani dish, a saag dish, and one other vegetarian dish.  All of the food was wonderful, bursting with fresh flavors.  We do not get Indian food very often, so it's a real treat when we do, and this place made it extra special.  All 4 of us enjoyed everything that we had.  Overall, it's a great place to go, and I'd highly recommend it.  When we dine out, I'm looking usually looking for really good food, good service & a nice ambiance, and that is the order of importance for us.  I can live with mediocre service & no ambiance, so long as the food is good.  But bad food cannot be compensated by service & ambiance.  This restaurant had really good food, and good service.  The ambiance is the weakest card in the deck for them, but it's a restaurant in a strip mall, and the food was so good, we'll be back there again any chance we get."}
{"text":"The price tells me the food is upscale, but my senses disagreed.  On my quest to eat at every Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh and perhaps even the world, I knew I would eventually have to be drug out of my city and into the suburbs to tick a few off my list.  This branch of Tamarind is owned by the same person(s) who manage the restaurant by the same name in Oakland. The Greentree location is more enjoyable in ambiance, largely because there is more space comparatively. The dining room is pretty and relaxing, with dark wood accents and tone-on-tone muted green striped walls. The server that helped us was excellent at doing so, attentive, and friendly.  Where things fell short for me was with the food. I enjoy a meal typically at medium spiciness or in the range of 5-6 if on a scale of 10. This is a pretty typical scale around these parts and this is the way I always order, but the Navaratan Korma that I ordered came at around an 8. I have nothing to prove by eating spicy food in terms of asserting my own toughness, so food this spicy only proves to muddle the beautiful mix of ingredients in the sauce to me. About the only other note I could really taste was a lot of sweetness, which sometimes happens with this dish. I wasn't impressed with this one though because they use a mix of vegetables, some of which come prepared either from frozen or from canned when the way this restaurant describes Navaratan's ingredients is as \"garden fresh vegetables.\" Navaratan translates loosely as 9 jewels and so the dish traditionally has a mix of 9 vegetables, fruits, and nuts. This misstatement was a disappointment and was misleading, as I would not have ordered the dish if it had not been for that description.  My husband's food experience was a bit better. He got the mysore masala dosa and it was delicious. It doesn't beat the Udipi dosa, but it was the second best dosa in Pittsburgh that I've found.  We ended the meal with galub jamun, but I would suggest you skip it or try something different for dessert. It was pretty forgettable and the pieces had no texture other than mushiness.  I'm not really sure why my experience was so different from all of the 5-star ratings I'm seeing from users before me. While this wasn't a bad experience, I certainly wouldn't drive out to Greentree for a special trip. Pittsburgh is fortunate to have so many Indian restaurants, and there are far better ones out there where you can spend your time."}
{"text":"This places comes in my best Indian restaurants in usa ! What a place! The good ambience, perfect service and tasty food blended so nicely that I was really happy after eating Indian after so long! Ordered idli/vada, masala dosa, set dosa and ordered veg chowmein, paneer butter masala, dal makhani for take out. Let me tell you all three cuisines were just delicious! Just the way it should be! Coming again to my favourite place if I hit Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place again. There was some confusion getting a table and we had to wait quite some time for a server to take our order. Despite the long wait the food was really good. We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Indian food in town. Their chutney has always been very good although a touch spicy sometimes but bearable. Food has always come out hot and tasty."}
{"text":"Great for a first time Indian visitor. Very large menu with friendly staff and delicious food."}
{"text":"My fiance and I had a wonderful dinner at the Tamarind Savoring India. It was our first time visiting and there were plenty of open tables and the staff were incredibly friendly. I ordered the chicken chettinadu, which was rich and flavorful. The chicken was cooked perfectly-tender and delicious. My fiance had the chicken tikka, and as a newcomer to Indian food, he loved it! We rounded out the meal with a couple roti and spiced paneer for an appetizer. Great experience overall, we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"The food was fresh, well prepared and delicious. The service was friendly and attentive. Not a fan of the ambiance, but I'm not there to eat the decor.  I went on a Saturday night around 6pm it was busy but not packed. I had samosas and they were freshly made, crispy on the outside and tender inside with a little spice. I tried the szechuan chicken, basically fried chicken pieces with onion, green peppers and hot peppers which again were freshly made, crispy outside and tender inside.   I was looking for palak paneer (cheese in creamy spinach) which they call saag paneer, and they were helpful in pointing me to what I was looking for. It was a large portion with tender rice. I also had the garlic naan, which was good but I wished they had cooked the garlic a bit before putting on the bread, it came out kind of raw. Regardless it was delicious, including the mango lassi.  I like spicy so I asked for some chili sauce which went wonderfully with everything, so be sure to ask for it if you like spicy. A bit on the expensive side considering there are paper napkins, but the portions were generous enough that I had plenty for a meal of leftovers. All of the servers were friendly and professional, no complaints there. My one complaint was the music - a bit obnoxious and a little loud for my taste.  Overall a very good Indian meal.  The strip mall it is in is on top of a hill with only a sign with all the shop names visible, so keep your eyes peeled if you are from out of town."}
{"text":"This was a great place to go for thanksgiving, besides their usual amazing Indian food in a beautiful buffet spread, there was tandoori turkey, cooked to perfection. The food is always amazing and the service is ridiculously friendly. One of my favorite Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Wow ... I'm from NYC, and this place is one of the best, most authentic places I've ever eaten at. I came on a Sunday when there was a buffet (and I normally hate buffets), but everything was very well prepared and delicious! There was even a drink similar to a mango lassi offered at the buffet table. I also ordered a mango lassi, which was one of the best I've ever had! The service was also amazing, quick, friendly, and efficient. LOVE this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I love Indian food. Love it. I really wanted to like this place because it is really close to our house and one of the only Indian places in the area. I was so disappointed in Tamarind, it is unreal. The server did not understand what grapefruit juice was (for my cocktail), I just gave up and ordered soda with my Vodka. That's no big deal. However, I ordered Muttar Panir, and it was easily the worst I have ever had. It tasted like Velveeta with tofu in it. Tasteless and gross. My husband and I were spoiled by the authentic Indian restaurants in our previous town, and are also puzzled by the Indian patrons in this restaurant. They cannot possibly be eating the same food we were served. We did not eat our food and will not return. We continue to look for a good authentic Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh. (Sigh)."}
{"text":"I adore Indian food and am always looking for great places that serve it. Let's start by simply stating that I've experienced the best Indian food (made by Indian mamas) and the worst (grocery curries in pouches) and I eat it all. But I know good Indian food when I see it, and this wasn't it.  I ordered my \"usual\" (which I use as a baseline) and there were several things that were off with my meal. First, my appetizer, the Samosas, were heavily deep-fried on the outside so they looked like Chinese egg rolls, which was a weird experience. I've never seen a samosa that looked like that and it was unfortunate because it made it too crunchy and hard to get into it. The filling was perfectly delicious and the chutneys were acceptable (not great, just ok) so I moved past it.  The Chicken Tandoori was tender, but lacked the correct amount of spice. It was odd because again, it wasn't bad, it just was slightly bland for tandoori. I guess that works for the generic American palate, but in my mind that's not the point of a traditional Indian restaurant. The way the chicken was displayed was lovely and they didn't skimp on the cabbage or thinly sliced red onions so all in all I was pleased with this dish.   I found the Naan to be a bit too thick and doughy, which again was simply a bit off. It was tasty bread, but it felt more like the consistency of pizza flatbread, not authentic naan. I buy pre-packaged naan at the grocery store when I'm craving it and I would say this was on-par with that. Not bad, just not that great.  Lastly, my Aloo Gobi Masala (a potato and cauliflower curry) was VERY greasy. I was horrified to see so much grease in a dish that is supposed to be healthy. What did they do to the recipe to make it look like that?! The size of the chunks of veggies in the dish were also far too large, which speaks to a general laziness on the part of whomever was acting as the \"sous chef.\" Don't get me wrong, the dish was generally flavorful but I've had much better, and the greasiness put me off of it a bit.  That's how I felt about this whole meal - generally good but not wonderful. I saw another reviewer noted that they were adding fake flavors and oils to their dishes and I agree, I think that's what is going on here. I can pay the same price and get better made Indian food elsewhere locally (see my review history), so I won't be wasting my time here again."}
{"text":"I had chicken dosa, samosa chat and chicken 65. Full flavor food and not so expensive ! Typical indian food and taste ! Keep clam and curry on!"}
{"text":"Another outstanding meal, jyst fantastic, from service to food everything was just first rate.  Try the tandoori combo platter. Wow."}
{"text":"It's time for an update on this review, as I have returned to Tamarind a number of times since writing my last one, and the food has improved. It's not always great, but sometimes the food here is excellent. I have noticed some off days, where the food fails to thrill me, and the prevalence of cayenne pepper has me sweating it out, but overall things here have gotten much better. We enjoyed the buffet on Mother's Day, when they really pulled out all the stops. The vegetarian options were impressive and everything tasted delicious. If they ever go back to offering the lunch buffet daily, as they used to, I will consider giving them another star."}
{"text":"This place keeps me yearning for more!  After hearing my friends talk about this place and after sampling their lunch specials at the local Indian grocery store (Manpasand), I decided to give this place a try. I have been here for a sit down dinner as well as ordered food to go.  Let me start by saying that the food is on the spicier side so order a level down than what you usually do. For our sit down meal we ordered Chicken Sangrilla (a new dish for me). This was tasty but SPICY (we ordered a 7 but could have done well with a 6). I could not really pin-point all the herbs an spices in this, however for a dish I never tried before, I found myself cleaning the plate. We also got the Chicken 65 which is fried marinated chicken strips (small pieces). While great in flavor this dish did not taste as I expected it to be (an overdose of spices that numbed my mouth). The two appetizers were however sufficient enough for our table of 4. BTW they do serve Papad once you place your order so you can munch on something till your appetizers arrive and they also have a full bar.  We then proceeded to get a plate of the Malai Kabab and Boti Kabab. Both of these were delicious - chicken was tender, lamb was perfectly cooked and both the meats were marinated well. In my opinion the size of the kababs were small. For entrees we ordered Kadai Chicken, Saag Paneer and Dal Fry. I am usually very picky about eating spinach at Indian restaurants but did not have any after-effects so I give the spinach here an \"all-clear.\" Since all the entrees came with rice, we supplemented our food with only two Garlic Naans and by the end of the night we were stuffed (haha maybe because of the sheer amount of food we ordered). I cannot remember if we ate any dessert.  Our server was attentive, food prices were in line for a 3 star Indian restaurant and the food was good (not overly oily or greasy).   During my second experience (take-out), I ordered a Garlic Naan, Sheekh Kabab and Tandoori Chicken. I felt like I was eating a health conscious chicken as the pieces were not very meaty. However, my major let down was the Sheekh Kabab - the meat felt dry, though still perfectly marinated.  Summing both my experiences, I would happily give it a 3.5 stars but to err on the side of caution a 3 for Yelp will be good for now."}
{"text":"Nice, consistent Indian food. Had a mixture of North and South dishes and all of them were okay. Service with a smile, and F-A-S-T!  Would visit again when in the area."}
{"text":"Managers are pathetic. They don't like to take feedback from customers. I had the worst experience dealing with the folks in the counter....I used to like this place before but never going there again."}
{"text":"Update - I'm giving back the one star I took away for the slow service. It really seems that they're trying to improve this aspect. It was very busy this past Friday night - full house - and the service was fantastic. Well done!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite indian restaurant in pittsburgh.  They make a number of southern i dian dishes that are hard to find and the dosa and uttapam are good."}
{"text":"Every time I've come here I've left satisfied. I always come for lunch & it's usually not very busy so food comes out fairly quickly. The employees are always extremely pleasant. I get the thali each time, and the curries change daily so it's like a little surprise for what you'll get. Their chicken makhani is the best I've ever had. I live 30 minutes away and anytime i want Indian food I'm willing to take the drive because my experiences are never anything short of great."}
{"text":"May be my new favorite Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh! Loved this place. The vegetable biryani and chicken tikka masala were both delicious, flavorful and spiced to perfection. Portions were huge - we had plenty to take home. The service was friendly and attentive. The place was packed on a Tuesday night, but they still sat us quickly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"absolutely delicious. i've been meaning to try this place for awhile and it did not disappoint. i got my order to go but will definitely be back to dine in. service was prompt and friendly and prices are very reasonable. great selection of vegetarian items!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, but I feel it is hard to find an Indian food restaurant that isn't good.  Staff spoke very clear English which is always a plus.  Spices were well done.  Service was good at first, but as soon as there were a few more tables and my food came out, even when flagging down wait staff I couldn't get my water refilled.  All in all I'd go back."}
{"text":"Typical Indian restuarant food which was tasting average.Hyderabadi chicken biryani has bland taste and no flavour.Spice levels were nil. Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"I went with my hoppy and my daughter for launch buffet. Ut was the worst experience ever. Food was cold and bad taste. There is no chicken and rice was rough and very cold to be eaten. We told the manager and we didnt pay for the food because we didnt even eat there! Food was sucks!"}
{"text":"A very delicious Indian dining experience with impeccable service!  We ordered Curry Chicken  and Shrimp Saag wih Garlic Naan.  All were fabulous. Prices were very reasonable and we had dinner for the next night as well. Definitely adding this to our list of regular places to visit.  And with an extensive menu, we can be adventurous diners for a long time."}
{"text":"As an Indian I can appreciate true Indian restaurants and this one was definitely one of those ! Great opportunity for both north and South Indian dishes to be enjoyed, ask the servers to guide you thru the South Indian dishes as they're a tad bit more spicy! Great service, everything is very reasonably priced. I wished we had this restaurant closer to where we live in Indiana !  Hint: if you see a decent Indian crowd in their restaurants chances are it's pretty darn good food!"}
{"text":"If you want Indian food this is a good place to go. I went during their buffet time and they had a large selection. Decent pricing and good food. The ambiance isn't the greatest"}
{"text":"I love the intricate spices and heat of the food. Most restaurants here dumb down for the Pittsburgh palate..  The women's bathroom doesn't lock, out of towels and the restaurant floor looks to be never cleaned. Buffet was sloppy looking and dark entry and dark interior only looks like they are hiding dirt..   I have enjoyed the food.  There are too many family types with children eating here. Children here tend to be fussy and annoying . Parents do not monitor their spawn.,they are unruly and noisy"}
{"text":"Love that this place is so gluten free friendly! Just ask someone working about what's gluten free and they're really knowledgeable. Love their weekend buffets!! Also this place is very different from Tamarind in Shadyside - apparently there's no connection. This place is worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"Its just Great food. It would be hard to find  better Indian food anywhere else.I have been here many times and I like their selection and consistency."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times, and it hits the spot.  Never super busy, so I always get a table right away.  I have tried a few things off their menu, and everything has always been tasty.  I like that they have many vegetarian options!  The assorted sampler is a great start.  Lots of things to try.  Dal Fry is my favorite!  Of course, don't forget the Naan!  It's served fresh and warm!"}
{"text":"I was desperate for some Indian food. My wife does not eat it and I was on the road without her so here was my big chance. You can tell how desperate I was because I ordered carry out and drove from Moon to this place. The location is in a strip mall and their section was being remodeled.  But once you got past the front door all was well.  Since I did not stay I can only speak for the service at the counter and the food. Both were good.   I ordered Shrimp Vindaloo, Naan, and the Black Forest Cake. So often as carry out you get ripped on the shrimp. Here there was plenty of shrimp and the Vindaloo was very good. It was very well spiced and the potatoes had enough time to gather up the flavors.  The Naan was a bit crispy for my taste. I like it tender.   I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"I love the buffets here every weekend. Variety of appetizers and desserts each time! Tomato Rasam is like no other..!!   One of the best South Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Delicious and quick. Every time we go my husband is treated like a local celebrity. He must sneak out here for lunch more often than he lets on! Watch our for your spice level. We like 0, which my Saudi husband get a kick out of because it pops up on the receipt as Arabic."}
{"text":"Tamarind Savoring India was a very pleasant surprise! My husband and I stopped here on a whim just passing through on our way home to Buffalo NY. We stopped in on a Tuesday night, around 8p and it was packed! (that is always a good sign) We were seated right away and were overwhelmed by all the delicious options :) We decided to order a vegetable samosa appetizer as well as the eggplant bharta dish and aloo gobi masala dish. Each item we ordered was vegan, another plus :) Everything exceeded our expectations; it was extremely flavorful and delightful! Would love to dine here again if we are in the area. The staff was all so friendly and were hard workers; our water dish was always full."}
{"text":"Didn't even realize there was an Indian restaurant so close to us! We ordered the chicken tikka and lamb biryani and a slice of their death my chocolate cake. Couldn't have been happier! Everything was moist, flavorful and delicious. Even though we ordered for pick up the waiters were still so nice courteous. We will definitely we going back :)"}
{"text":"Never had a mysore masala so big n soo stuffed!! The dosa stuffing was more spicy n tasty!!   1  less for the chutney and the salt level. Coconut Chutney had no taste n salt in food a lill high. Again, not everyone makes chutney that good and maybe my salt preference is low."}
{"text":"I have no idea how I haven't reviewed this place yet! This is out go-to place for Indian food since past 3 years. The food is solid and pretty consistent every time. Their gobi manchurian, chilli chicken, idlis and dosas are really really good! Plus the service is stellar! We have moved from the area but hope to return for the food soon!!"}
{"text":"I must be missing something but I read the reviews and was excited to come, but left disappointed. I felt that the food was greasy and not super appealing. We ordered multiple appetizers and dishes and nothing blew my mind."}
{"text":"I've ordered here on Grubhub a few times and always enjoyed it, but today we finally went to the restaurant and it was Awesome! Everything that we have ever ordered has been top notch, and the experience at the restaurant was even better then we had expected it to be. The Garlic Naan is a must, we like to dip it in the Tomato soup which is amazing. We also love the Fried spicy cauliflower, ginger chicken, dosa, and of course the staples like Biryani and Tikka Masala. Another nice thing about this place is that they have a full bar, which is rare for an Indian restaurant. They have a weekend buffet which is next on our list! Anyways, prices are very reasonable, service is great, and food can't be beat! Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last night. It was recommended by some work friends. The building appears to be going through renovations but it didn't appear to affect the interior. Seemed a bit of a wait to be seated and then a long wait to get a drink. In fact, when the waiter finally came around he seemed a little short and annoyed with us for some reason although we were only sitting and talking. Food came quickly and everything was delicious. We have a favorite place that we typically go that has awesome service and great food and we definitely missed the warm welcome from our normal spot but the food here it top notch, so that makes up for everything else. Overall, I would recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"The food was really bad . Service is alright. Tried Special Chicken Biryani which turned out too bad . Chicken dosa had absolutely no taste . Over all the chicken did not feel like fresh . Very bad taste . Would not be going back ."}
{"text":"Since I am not a yogurt fan, I wasn't crazy about the Dahi Vada, which is cold lentil donuts in a cold yogurt sauce, but my Tikka Masala was out of this world, and I don't even like tomatoes! The chicken was really tender and it was all so creamy and filling. I too enjoyed the chocolate cake. Who knew an Indian restaurant would make a good chocolate cake? Overall, I'd recommend, my personal tastes notwithstanding."}
{"text":"This place is overrated. I didn't find this place to be 4-5 stars worth of indian food. The interior is nice, inviting, and smells of india. The patrons that eat here kinda smell, no surprise there.   They give you complementary papars before your meal however two of mine were hardly prepared right. I thought my Chicken Tikka was way too dry and lacked sufficient flavor. My garlic naan was over cooked and didn't have any taste of garlich. I really enjoyed the mango lassi however. Service was on the slow side and took them a while to bring my check and boxes for the food i could barely finish.   Maybe this place was having a bad day when i went or maybe i want this place to be good.   I will try this place again for redemption"}
{"text":"Best Indian food I have had!   Okay, I am not an connoisseur of Indian cuisine, but this restaurant made me crave Indian food just as much as pizza or burgers! Both times I have visited both the food and the service have been absolutely excellent!   I tried the Chicken Tikki Masala and the garlic naan - the garlic naan is to die for! And the garlic taste is the perfect accompaniment to this dish.   Both times I visited, they were in the middle of renovating the restaurant; from what I hear that has now wrapped up, so I will be visiting again soon to check out the updates!  Great local spot for delicious fresh Indian food at a great price."}
{"text":"Went here for their Saturday lunch buffet.  They had a variety of options but I enjoyed the goat chettinaad, daal makhani and naan.  The kesari and kulfi were a nice finish to the meal.    Didn't really enjoy the paneer tikka but all the other buffet items I had were good and had a good dose of spice to them.  Something to keep in mind is that you can't order off the menu when they offer lunch buffet.    Will be back again!"}
{"text":"I love Indian food and this is the best restaurant in the Pittsburgh area. My boyfriend and I have tried a variety of the foods they have and we have not found one what was not amazingly good."}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh, it just doesn't get any better than Tamarind for Indian cuisine.  Moderate prices, great service, and really great, authentic dishes that don't skimp on the heat.  If you ask for extra spicy, you GET extra spicy.  We've been visiting this place on occasion for several years, and from the very first visit, we noticed that there were a lot of folks of Indian heritage frequenting it.  That hasn't changed.  It's tempting to order appetizers at an Indian restaurant, because usually portion sizes in such establishments are modest by Pittsburgh big eater standards, but that's not necessary here.  A papadum and some nan are the only sides you'll need consider.  The garlic nan is excellent, as is the dal.  My favorite dish is the lamb vindaloo, but the tandoori sampler shines, especially for those who are shy about curry."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Saturday night with my wife for dinner. I had never been to Tamarind Savouring India before but my wife had and we were in the mood for some Indian food.  Since Tamarind was in the Entertainment book that's where we headed.  It's located in a strip mall right off of Greentree road.  While the outside makes it look somewhat small the inside is actually pretty large.  It is painted in vivid and warm colors like orange and yellow and has some Indian artwork on the walls.  My wife and I ended up getting seated at one of the booths.  For dinner on this occasion I went with the chicken chettinadu (spicy curry cooked with coconut milk and traditional South Indian Grounded Marsala - spice level 9) while my wife went with the chicken tikki masala.  Then since we were both hungry I ordered the green chile and cheese naan while my wife ordered the garlic naan.  Whenever it came out everything looked fantastic with my chettinadu being a greenish colored sauce with lots of chile peppers showing while my wife's entree was in an orangish colored sauce.  Not only did my dish look good but it tasted good too!  There were layers of spices which all helped to form a nice depth of flavor.  It was also very spicy but not overly so which was perfect for me.  As for my naan, well it was pretty fantastic.  It was almost like eating a flavorful grilled cheese flatbread.  The green chiles added a little spice while the cheese was flavorful, ooey and gooey and the naan itself was good.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  My wife and I both had a hankering for Indian food and Tamarind certainly hit the spot for both of us."}
{"text":"Excellent, Delicious FOOD.  Will visit again - anytime!  Clean and courteous Staff.  Fast Service.  Its the FOOD....... that made me give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Good prices.  Service is a little slow but food quality more than makes up for it.  Tikka Masala is awesome as is the Paneer.  Naan is amazing. Love this place."}
{"text":"Nice Indian place hidden atop hill on Greentree. Food was good as expected of a good Indian restaurant. Had the Chicken Sangrilla, Lamb Korma, and Kheema Naan ...all were great."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant several times in the past and the food has always been good. Today was no exception although this was my first Sunday buffet experience. The food was excellent , the spread comprehensive. The place was crowded without being overwhelming. A big thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Tamarind is an OK place to eat in strip mall in Pittsburgh. The waiter did not seem to understand us, and we had trouble understanding him. We had the tandoor variety appetizer that was spiced so hot that it really hurt. Then I had the chicken tikka and my partner had the lamb vindaloo. The vindaloo was hot, the tikka was perfect. I like that they have Indian beers--I was pleased to have a Kingfisher. Tamarind was just OK."}
{"text":"Went to this place at a relatively low-traffic time. Unfortunately, the service at this restaurant is not very good. Takes a long time just to get water, have someone take your order or even get you your check. On multiple occasions, we didn't receive more drinks etc unless we asked multiple times.   With regards to the food, we had vegetable pakora to start and then had four orders of naan, navaratan korma, gobi manchurian, and tandoori chicken. The tandoori chicken was well done and they give you a lot of naan. Overall the food is quite flavorful and can make up for the restaurant's bad service. The gobu manchurian is a bit spicy for the average person so beware, you only get 4 gobis. The navaratan korma is very flavorful and the creamy sauce goes well with the naan; however, i was a bit disappointed that the amount of vegetables was so minimal. It seemed to be mostly a cream sauce with scarce green beans and potato here and there.  Overall, this place has flavorful food but they don't do the little things well."}
{"text":"I was visiting Pittsburg area to see my friend, was looking for some indian restaurant and saw this while driving around. The chef was good enough he did a special for us since we were the last customers and were new to the area. The food was simply marvelous."}
{"text":"Tried their lunch buffet with friends from work. Very fresh authentic South And North Indian food. I liked the tava fish as it was lent, the place is clean and they include mango lassi and chai in the buffet. Krishna was stocking the buffet and answered my questions and really is a great Manager.  Try this place for authentic fresh and tasty Indian food."}
{"text":"Accommodating to special dietary needs is a huge plus for me.  I always leave satisfied and pleased with my choices. I have never had anything bad here.  Dosa are wonderful! I would love to go to a buffet here."}
{"text":"Tamarind is one of my fav Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh. I would highly recommend their Chicken 65 (Indo-Chinese dish), Dosa's and Cut Mirchi Bajji (Jalapeno Fritters). Their prices are very reasonable and the staff is very down to earth and helpful."}
{"text":"Wow. I am from Columbus but went to Tamarind in Pittsburg for second time. Had a buffet. Food was too good. Starting with chicken and mutton kebab. They were very tasty and authentic . Then had the naan, lamb curry and vege sides. Everything was tasty and tasted like home food I get in Tamilnadu. Chicken Briyani, pongal and rasam were also good. Will definitely go again anytime I go to Pitt again."}
{"text":"I have been going to place for last 2/3 years.   I always liked the place.   I thought I should share my opinion with all yelpers.  This place is in Green Tree area.   Place is really nice and cozy.   They have a party room available on same premises.   If someone wants to have a party for 25 people, they provide you enough private place and cater food.   Parking is a bit struggle though.   It's in a strip mall where parking is shared with bunch of other places.  Staff is very well managed and they are always ready to help you if you are new to Indian food.   The owners are from South India and so the food is inspired by the south indian receipes.   They also are very flexible with how much hot/spicy you food you want.  So tell them up front and they make sure your taste buds are not burned.  They have some great appetizers.  Chicken 65 is my dish.   Other appetizers are also great and sometime we order too much those since everyone has there own preference.   If you like hot/spicy stuff, order  \"Cut Mirchi\".   These are chiilies deep fried in a lentil batter served with onions and lemon.  Excellent!  The Rice dishes are also very authetic and one should give it a try for their biryani items.   Biryani is Indian version of paella.   They serve pure veg biryani as well.   Chicken curries are excellent and we always like dish called Chicken Curry.  Chicken Tikka Masala is also another dish you can't go wrong with.    Veg entrees are also excellent and we like spinach with panir, channa masala.     Breads are also well prepared and you will be happy no matter what bread you get.  I love their butter naan.  Overall they do a excellent job and prices are very reasonable.   I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a nice Indian food joint."}
{"text":"All the non-vegetarian items were bland. We ordered chicken dosa and special chicken Biryani and both were a let down. We literally ate nothing from both the dishes served. And there is this annoying guy who tries to fake the American accent which was really really annoying. Totally disappointing experience.  P.S. - We were charged full amount for the food. We didn't argue though."}
{"text":"Very good.  Growing up eating Indian, I'm judgmental.  This is solid, and don't just take my PA born Indian self for it, my father from Mumbai agrees.    Good chicken tikka, the shrimp vindaloo could have been hotter.  The waiter warned us, vindaloo is hot...apparently he erred on the side of safety when it comes to heat.    Nan was fantastic - had a couple types.    Service was extremely friendly.    Only reason I didn't give 5 stars, is atmosphere.  Everything was great, but I don't want to feel like I'm eating in  my aunt's \"extra space room\" during a family party.  Invest in some décor upgrades, little advertising, this place will do even better, than as good as their doing.    Highly recommended for the food, but don't go for atmosphere."}
{"text":"Highly enjoyed our experience at Tamarind. The restaurant isn't huge and although we were seated right away at 7 on a Friday night, there was a wait when we left.   Service was fast. Servers were friendly and helpful answering any questions related to the menu. The don't remember much in regards to the decor but the atmosphere was warm and intimate. Limited bar seating was available with a TV.   As for the food, if you are new to Indian food, when they say spicy, they mean spicy so be careful! Unlike some places that say stuff is spicy even though it barely is, they really mean it here! I love spicy good so I had the  chicken vindaloo which was delicious (one of their spicier dishes). Also tried the chicken curry which I liked even more. Both served with white rice. Garlic and onion naan very flavorful and highly recommended especially as a compliment to a spicy dish. Also had a fried vegetable appetizer that was breaded in a deliciously spiced chick pea batter and fried. Husband had a mixed grille dish that he enjoyed and would get again. The Hurricane was yummy but I don't think it had much alcohol content.   This seems like an authentic Indian restaurant and I'm looking forward to eating here again!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible, it will ruin your night !! Also if you order they will ask you from 1 to 10 how spicy do you want your food to be , don't even bother it will all be the same level."}
{"text":"Its better than other Indian Restaurants in Pittsburgh. I tried buffet once and à la carte once. Buffet was definitely better option than ordering from menu. Also gulab jamun served in buffet were much better. Overall, it is worth trying this place if you are craving for good Indian food."}
{"text":"Don't know what the fuss is about. Tried the menu vada sambhar and Rava masala dosa. Both were good and tasty, but disappointed with the sambhar. Sambhar wasn't spicy and didn't have the zing needed, kept on thinking something was missing. Chutney wasn't great either. Mango lassi felt more watery and a bit too sweet.  Staff was really weird. They were not attentive, had to keep calling them several times only to go unnoticed. The restaurant wasn't busy at all and I still don't know why the staff was so reluctant to help customers. It did get busy by 9:30 pm when we left.  Didn't try any of the curries, since I was disappointed with sambhar. The mango kulfi wasn't all that bad though.  The location is also a bit out of the way, as the GPS doesn't lead you to the right location and the name on the board isn't bright enough on a busy street to get noticed. Not coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice and loved our experience. The lunch buffet has an amazing array of food to choose from. Extremely great service."}
{"text":"My family came to town and we decided to try Tamarind Savoring India. The food and service can be simply described as OUTSTANDING. We enjoyed two goat and two lamb entrees. The seasoning, spices and flavors were amazing.   Our waiter was most helpful in suggesting appetizers and main dishes. Each person in our party had a different desire of \"spiciness\". He was able to recommend dishes to meet each diner's needs - and the kitchen superbly delivered with each level of spice. The level of attentiveness was ideal - meeting all of our requests, filling drinks, etc. without impeding our conversations and limited time together.   The family has since headed home, but I am already looking forward to my next trip to this restaurant. On a side note, I love meat in my food, it's almost a necessity. However, at this fine establishment, I will certainly try a vegetarian dish at some point."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have had my share of Indian food, and this is one of the best places I have been to in a long time. The menu had many options that I have never seen before, which I appreciated.  We had Chicken 52 (I think) and the sampler appetizer. Both were excellent and were eaten quickly. Mango lassis were excellent, sweet and smooth. For entrees we had the mixed tandori grill, Lamb Korma, and chicken with peppers. All were excellent although the chicken with peppers was a bit too spicy for me. We also had excellent Lamb naan and a fried bread (not sure what its name is).  I would definitely recommend going to this restaurant if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Seriously good and authentic food with great variety and super quality. I put on 7-8 pounds very time I go there!"}
{"text":"My first time here and a great time. My friend recommended this place to me.. I really liked the gobi Manchurian a lot."}
{"text":"We went here on a recommendation from a friend. They opened at 5 and we arrived shortly after so we were he first ones there. We sat down put in an appetizer that we wanted before our meal. For our entree I ordered the chicken tiki masala and hubby ordered the chicken fried rice.   After about 5 or so minutes another group walks in behind us and is seated. They were regulars because thy knew the waiter by name and he knew them as well. They placed there ordered and waited as well. About 10 minutes later I see food come out but it wasn't ours. The couples who came in before were enjoying their appetizer before us. I thought, well maybe ours took some time so we kept waiting, then after another 10 minutes they brought out their entrees. It wasn't until they received their food that the manager comes over and tells us there was a problem with our receipt and it didn't print in the kitchen so they never received our order.   He offered to pay for our mango lassi's to compensate but I was already upset about the long wait time. Our food finally arrived and it was just ok. The chicken was tougher than I'd like it to be. My husbands rice was really good though so that was one plus.   I think I'll pass on this one and keep going to the Taj Mahal on the North side. Sorry tamarind. Better luck next time."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I have been here for lunch and dinner and it's awesome for both. Would like to come for breakfast next time too! I have had their dosa and idlis and both are really good! The chutneys and sambar and all that are awesome and their service is friendly and fast. I would definitely recommend coming here for authentic Indian food, especially South Indian!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the service was really friendly and helpful (as I don't understand most Indian cuisine items). I tried new stuff that surprised me.  The atmosphere was the only thing lacking in making this experience better."}
{"text":"Happy to report that food & service continues to be top notch. They have expanded their footprint (good sign already hu'h?) and the restaurant is more 'roomy' now. More servers and attention to customer service (prompt refills).  Special Chicken Biryani still rocks. So does Cut Mirchi. And pastries. Butter Scotch pastry is still amazing.  And, Mr.Senthil. Da man!"}
{"text":"We'd been meaning to try Tamarind for some time but didn't get around to it until this evening, and I am elated to tell you all that everything we had from starter to main to end was -- to put it simply -- a treat.  I am not Sherlock Holmes and thus am no expert on spices. My (damned) acid reflux also makes partaking in painfully high spice levels an act of poor judgement. I also like to taste what I am eating aside from seed-borne heat. The spice fiends of the Yelposphere who think that food is bland and worthless unless it deadens their tongues may scoff at my moderate intake of all things peppery, but I prefer my food to be a pleasure to consume, not an exercise in masochism. Having mentioned that, I found no issues with the pungency of what I ate.    In regards to my entree, that being Lamb Korma, I asked for a 5 and got something that playfully nibbled at my tastebuds without overtaking the other components of the dish. Rich and succulent as a Hungarian ghoulash, the Korma reminded me of an even creamier interpretation of the more conventional (and famous?) Lamb Curry. A squiggly line of what I assume was yogurt was drizzled atop the gravy for presentation. The lamb, braised exquisitely, was as delicate and suety as the zenith of pulled pork. Exactly what spices were in the Korma, I couldn't tell you, but they were there, hiding underneath the buttery flavors and even permeating the avocado and walnut-colored room. Accentuating everything, usurping nothing, the essences were indescribable yet omnipresent.   Kay's Tikka Masala cruised on a track parallel to the Korma, but included chicken, tomato, and onions to liven it up further. Kay was unable to finish her portion, so I...intervened. Both dishes were so luscious, when our excellent, friendly, and (interestingly enough) non-Indian server came by our table to see how our dinner was proceeding, I merely looked at her, closed my eyes, hummed, and swayed, much to her amusement and relief (the poor lass was dealing with a difficult party as we dined).   Our first course consisted of the savorily tangy bread pudding vs. falafel of Dahi Vada. The fritters of lentil could have been a dessert had there been milk and sugar involved, but instead, both of the large \"fried donuts\" came to us in a pool of raita (a white yogurt sauce) and embellished with carrot shards and other vegetables. Velvety and served chilled, I felt that this would be the dish to serve with or after something particularly piquant. Nonetheless, the weightless patties were an ideal counterbalance to the entree.  Rather than go with Naan, that staple of Indian cuisine I've enjoyed countless times, I opted for its billowy, crisp, hot fat-baptized variant in Batura. The most savorous fried dough in all of gastronomy, the gilded bread itself was feather-light, had bubbles all through it, and revealed a hollow interior when pulled apart to dip into and soak up whatever we pleased. If any Indian restaurant decided to open a booth at a carnival, they'll do well to make plenty of Batura for it is fair food that is at once familiar and exotic. I have had Batura before, but it had been so long that I had forgotten what it was called. Tonight's dinner was a pleasant and decadent refresher course on this Asiatic sopapilla.   I almost went with an Indian dessert such as Rasmalai to conclude the evening's experience, but when I found out that Tamarind makes their own cakes in their own bakery, I just had to take a pop at one. Feeling like chocolate cake (Tamarind has a wide assortment), we each went for just that and were pleased to find that it was moist, constructed ornately with multiple layers, ethereal in texture, and iced with an equally airy coffee-tinged frosting that resembled mousse. We were assured by our server that Tamarind does not buy their cakes elsewhere, and I am still trying to tell myself that I did in fact have myself a truly blissful cut of chocolate cake...from an Indian restaurant.  How common is that?   Savoring India, indeed. Drive up that winding road to find the hidden shopping plaza in the suburban sky and deliver thyselves unto culinary Vaikuntha."}
{"text":"I have tried every indian buffet in Pittsburgh and Tamarind is the BEST!!! The food is fresh and hot, the restaurant is clean and well lit. The food in the buffet is spicier and there is so much more to choose from as apposed to other buffets. They included different types of meat, not just chicken but also goat... which was my favorite dish. None of the dishes were watered down, nothing looked old, they never ran out of naan bread. The buffet included mango lassi that was refreshing and just a wonderful. I was in heaven... I am definitely going back soon. So far, Tamarind Savoring India is my favorite place to go!"}
{"text":"This little gem is hidden between a Chinese restaurant and a Mexican restaurant. The waiter was super nice and the food came out quick.  The Tikka Masala was amazing.  I was full and continued to eat it because it was so good. We had leftovers. There is an Indian store right next store so if you want more you can go there and get everything you need."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for great Indian food. The bhuna is my favorite. The vindaloo is good. The tandoori is great. The service is always prompt."}
{"text":"I called them at 11:00am on a Thursday and asked if I could order lunch for 10 to go, which is not something they normally do.  The waiter checked with the chef and they were able to accommodate me and it was ready by noon.  I left a huge tip and was so thankful that they were able to help me out.  I ordered saag paneer, chicken tikka masala, naan, and rice.  The people who ate the food said it was the best Indian they have had in the city.  I will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Great Place..I recently went there to buy some spices I needed to cook up some Indian cuisine..I was greeted by a man named Jay who helped me threw the shopping experience..He told me what spices I would need to make a few dishes I wanted to try..The store was way bigger and the assortment was huge..The prices were way cheaper then I thought they would be too..I will for sure go back and see Jay again.."}
{"text":"Our favorite Indian restaurant in the Pittsburgh area. Great food and great service. Reasonable prices. Try the cauliflower appeetizer (I forget the name) and the chicken chettinadu."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with friendly service. I always order the Special Briani. Killer dish. If you like spicy food, ask them to make it spicy or it may be 'dialed-down' . Not open MONDAYS. I can never seem to remember that small detail."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place, I like the sag paneer and the tika masala paneer.  The mango lassi and the fried Nan are also very good.  I'm really looking forward to trying the buffet so I can expand my horizons a bit.  It's a little hard to find, but totally worth it.  The service is vastly improved since my last review, I can't complain about a single thing.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious , the service is friendly.Me and my husband usually go for weekend buffets & we love it. We have taken our friends while they were visiting us from Ohio.We all enjoyed the food. One of the best indian restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"A disclaimer before I get to the review.  Since I'm Indian and have lived in India for a number of years, my standards for Indian food are probably higher than most people's.  I rarely go out to eat at Indian restaurants since my mother can beat most of them, even on a bad day (the exception being South Indian food, dosa, vada, idli etc.). Now that that's over, I'll say that Tamarind is about as good as most other Indian places in America, A-OK.  We had the Goat Biryani, the Dahi Paapdi, Andhra Spicy Dosa, Non-Veg Tandoori platter, and garlic naan. The goat biryani wasn't what we were expecting.  And since I've lived in Hyderabad and visited Lucknow a number of times, I think I have a pretty good idea of what biryani is.  It had way too much green chili and pudina.  The Dahi Paapdi just wasn't that flavorful at all.  The dosa and tandoori platter, on the other hand, were both good.   The sambar, idli and gunpowder were on par with spots like Sarvana Bhavan (in America).  The tandoori platter was generously portioned and perfectly seasoned.  Finally, the garlic naan was great (one of the best I've ever had).  Piping hot, slathered in butter with exactly the right amount of garlic. If your standards for Indian food aren't super high, Tamrind definitely won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Four for dinner.  Overall, we liked it.  I had the vegetable biryani which I found tasty but rather \"light\" on vegetables.  I think all of us liked our meals.  I'd break down my rating this way:    Ambiance:  3  [sorta average, but OK]    Service:  4 [the water was good but rather full of himself]    Food quality: 3.5-4  [very good but not excellent]    Food quantity:  4.5  [three of four of us did not finish]     Prices:  4    Value: 3.5  Would we go back there? Sure!"}
{"text":"Wow! I'm not usually one to give a restaurant 5 stars after trying it only once, but this place totally deserves it!   We went here with a couple of friends who are regulars and their baby. The staff was so excited to meet their new edition and all came over to say hi and get some facetime with cutie.   We ordered some appetizers to share which included the vegetable pakora and the idly manchurian. Both of these were delicious. I really liked the idly manchurian which had a nice kick and texture.   For my entree I ordered the paneer tikka masala and an order of poori. This was the best tikka masala sauce I have ever had. I was enjoying eating just that over rice, even though there was plenty of paneer in the sauce. The poori was much different than any other poori i have ever had, but it was also delicious!   I can't wait to go back, but knowing how good that sauce is I am probably already roped into ordering it again!"}
{"text":"I am here with my friends. We ordered apolla fish, idli manchuria, andhra spicy dosa, chicken, lamb and egg biryanis. With 4 star rating I expected it to serve from good food. They are pouring food color and oil in their food and are very greasy. They taste very average. None of the dishes were even satisfactory. I am totally disappointed. I am not going to come back here again. I advice the chef to please reduce the food coloring and a bit of oil in your dishes."}
{"text":"The two star is for the extensive buffet menu. Other than that its a one star. Absolutely tasteless. I'm from Dallas, TX and I have been enough Indian restaurants in Texas, New York, NJ and many places. This probably ranks at the lower end. Rubbery naan, the egg plant curry was absolutely the worst. Sambar was never refilled and service was below expected, the only thing for service at a buffet is taking the plates out and serving water, that too they failed. My suggestion: have some other cuisine or at least try a different one."}
{"text":"2 words : Gobi Manchurian!!!!  We had an awesome time here for dinner. The food was awesome and plentiful. The mixed grill was an expertly grilled combination of lamb, shrimp and tandoori chicken. I had the pleasure of dining on the lamb korma which was the best  have ever had.  Tender chunks of lamb in a creamy korma sauce. It was so good I could have licked the plate. The chicken masala was also very good but spicy. The nan was precut so it seems like more than it is which I didn't like. The best of the dishes was the delicious, crispy, sweet, spicy Gobi Manchurian. This is a must have dish.    The restaurant is byob so bring your favorite wine. The corkage fee is 10.00 and we were told by the manager that this was per bottle but our check only showed 1 fee and we had 2 bottles. this brings me to the service which was excellent. I have no complaints. TIP: on your way out visit the grocery store next door"}
{"text":"Mine was a to go. Food tasted good. No doubt about that. But the quantity of the food provided was hideous. They asked me to wait for half an hour \"if you don't want half cooked food\", as quoted by the guy who took the order. 6 pieces of chicken manchurian was given to me in a box. It did not even fill half of the box in which they gave it to me. And the quantity of the fried rice I ordered was the same. Either give them in small boxes so that the customer doesn't feel dejected or at least fill the box upto 75%. And yes, it does not take half an hour to cook this quantity of food. This place is disappointing."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout for myself and my two brothers. We got the chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, and the tandoori chicken, along with naan and roti. The food was pretty serviceable overall, but the portions of meat were very small. The tandoori was very frustrating, as it appeared to have several well-prepared pieces, but two of the five had almost no actual chicken on them. On the plus side, the meat was moist and flavored well. The rice, garlic naan, and roti were tasty, but the breads also felt overpriced for the quantity. We liked the tikka masala more than the curry. The downside was the portion size (a small plastic container, not even completely filled) and although it was pretty flavorful, it was missing an extra note to really tie it together and brighten up the dish.   Considering the convenient location, we may end up ordering from Tamarind again, but we will certainly not rush back."}
{"text":"Food was absurdly bad. Service was even worse. Definitely never coming back. Do not recommend one bit."}
{"text":"Don't mess around with any other Indian restaurant in the burgh, Tammarind is simply the best! I come here every Friday for the buffet and usually when restaurants have buffets the food is sub par at best not the case here. The food has so much flavor and they mix it up with different items so it never gets old. The chicken biryani is the best I've ever had better than any other Indian restaurant. The staples such as chicken tikka and butter chicken etc are also packed with flavor. If you want more authentic Indian food get a plane ticket and go to India, but I'm not even sure they could beat this."}
