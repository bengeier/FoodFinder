{"text":"Mexi Casa is by far my favorite bar/restaurant in Pittsburgh - hell anywhere for that matter! The people are the best, the food is delicious, and they always have a nice selection of great craft beers on tap. I've been coming here for a decade for a reason!"}
{"text":"Despite the mixed reviews you can read for yourself about Mexi-Casa I think the food is decent. Is it authentic? Not really. Is it the best quality? Eh, not so much. But it IS decent, and I enjoyed my chicken burrito.  

My issue with Mexi-Casa is the amount they charged. My I felt the portion was pretty large and I didn't end up finishing it- but don't think I wasn't charged! I thought the drinks were over priced as well. 

I would come here if I was really hungry and craving a burrito in Dormont, (that happens more than you think!) but otherwise I'd rather drive to a Mad Mex."}
{"text":"Mexican food it is not.  While the food was entirely edible, it vaguely reminded me of the sad attempts at Mexican food my Polish mother tried making.  Just because you have an Ortega seasoning packet and Tabasco sauce does not make your place Mexican."}
{"text":"Horrible!!  Though it seems popular to some locals for the alcohol....
Ordered steak fajitas ... asked for my steak more rare... wish the server told me it was mystery meat - like steak-ums. Awful. Asked for shrimp instead - and got a bunch of bland bay shrimp. Really??  Food served in plastic baskets and nothing was really appetizing. I hardly ate anything as everything we ordered, including a burrito, seemed like it was worse than taco bell.  Never ever will go back. They're featured on Groupon alot... no wonder.  They need to get serious. Mexican food isn't expensive nor hard to prepare.  Quality ingredients and a knowledgeable staff who will properly advise their cliental will win over customers."}
{"text":"The absolute worst burrito I've had in my life. Ordered the veggie option assuming it would actually contain veggies but instead it was full of refried beans and raw zucchini. A meat option was also ordered and there again no meat was to be had, but yet again a pile of canned - tasting refried beans.  If I could give 0 stars I would!"}
{"text":"Love coming down to MexiCasa and enjoying an evening full of good food and beer! I haven't had a bad meal yet. I always leave happy and full. Get the southwest sauce!!!!!"}
{"text":"So glad Mexicasa reopened!  I didn't know how much I'd miss it until it was gone. Under its new management, it has most of the old staples, as well as a few new things, including vegetarian tacos! The decor is the same as before, and it looks great.

Again, don't except real Mexican food. But as far as neighborhood bar/restaurants go, it's awesome!"}
{"text":"Great, unpretentious neighborhood joint. Tasty for the price. Top-notch service."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty decent. Definitely great for a local bite without breaking the bank. We particularly enjoy their taco Tuesdays and Wing Wednesdays. The best thing about mexi-casa has to be the server by the name of Ashley. We've had her serve us a number of times now and she is always fantastic! She has such an upbeat personality, has yet to mess up an order, and is very attentive and thoughtful. My husband and I agree she is the best server we've had in years, anywhere. If you want good food and great service I recommend this spot."}
{"text":"The food is very good - can't beat the queso!!   Have had a few of the burritos, Wanna Iguana the best in my opinion!  Service was good, but I will say the best thing about MexiCasa is the LaBomba Shot -  who knew a draft of Dos Equis lager with a shot of Cuervo and lime juice would be so good!?!?!?  Never had it anywhere else, but DAMN!!?!?!"}
{"text":"Anyone that thinks this is good mexican food must not have taste buds. I grew up in AZ from a very large mexican family and mexi casa is terrible. The meat tastes like precooked frozen crap u get in the freezer aisle. The chicken meat even had freezer burn. The chips come straight out of the bag cold and stale. The salsa is absolutely flavorless.  My friend for some reason reallllly wanted to eat here. I was so disgusted with the food he paid for the entire meal and he agreed that I would from now on  I choose all mexican restaurants we eat at."}
{"text":"$6 for a basket of chips and flavorless salsa? no thanks.  I am sick of giving this place chances when it just is never great. Much better burritos and food around the city."}
{"text":"Ok, we had Groupon so decided to go there. I have seen this place many times, thought of going, but did not get a chance. With the Groupon, we did. The service was okay, not bad. We ordered chips and caso cheese, they ran out of guacamole. The chips were way way salty, we could not eat it. I mentioned that to the waitress, and she did not offer to change but said sorry about that.   I ordered tuna fish taco. they gave three of them but fist felt very dry and rubbery. My son ordered a rack of ribs, they were also not very good. I would not go there next time. The only good thing was the beer! Nothing special though."}
{"text":"I recently bought a house in Dormont and I was so excited to see that Mexi Casa had reopened. I've never been more disappointed in my food somewhere. I am really not picky and I wasn't expecting the best Mexican out of a Pittsburgh bar. But Mexi Casa used to be half decent and I enjoyed going there on dates or with friends. I have eaten there twice since they reopened just to make sure it wasn't a fluke or a bad day for the cook. Everything my fianc√© and I got was completely tasteless, no spice, and overpriced. The chicken and vegetables in the burritos appeared to be from frozen veggies or cans. The rice was dry. There was no sauce or seasoning. The wings didn't even have sauce or spices. The tacos were flavorless beef with a couple pieces of iceberg lettuce. Most appalling was that the guacamole was TEN dollars, and it was basically just smashed avocado with nothing else in it. I have never paid that much for guacamole, even for the best or large quantities of fresh made guacamole on the Tex-Mex border. It was honestly baffling. Most Pittsburgh bars have cheap food. And the nicer restaurants have good overpriced food. This was horrible food horribly overpriced. Someone needs to consult with them. Hire a chef, I don't know who's cooking now but I made better food as a teenager after school... And price your food according to your demographic. You are not an upscale restaurant in San Francisco. Your guacamole should be 5 dollars. The drinks are also overpriced and not strong at all. This is the harshest review I've ever written, but I do it because I want so badly for it to be good. It's so sad it's so close to me and inedible! They are currently repainting the building, but I wish they would put that money into making real food."}
{"text":"Yum! What a good meal I had at Mexi-casa today. I ordered chicken fajitas & they came to my table sizzling hot. The presentation was appealing & it was more than enough food for one person. The chicken was tender and the peppers & onions were cooked perfectly. I topped it off with a banana & peach frozen margarita. If you haven't tried this restaurant since it has been under new ownership I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. The food is not traditional Mexican, but that's OK. It's still tasty and affordable Tex-Mex... or I guess in this case Pitt-Mex. Great beer specials, friendly service, and it's awesome to find a bar/restaurant that actually obeys the no-smoking laws."}
{"text":"The food at Mexi-casa rocks. Great craft beer selection with taps that rotate regularly. The best gringo-Mexican grub in Pittsburgh. All the burritos are well over a pound. I always leave full and happy. Mexi-casa es muy bueno!"}
{"text":"WAY overpriced plain chips and salsa, Bad burritos, bland food.  
I want to like this place and have given it numerous tries, but all were disappointing."}
{"text":"They will be the first to tell you this isn't authentic Mexican food but the spicy chicken burritos are treat."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Food is processed and bland and drinks are kinda pricey for what you're getting. It's kinda cool inside but not the best Mexican."}
{"text":"$3 Corona on a Friday night not bad. Kind of a weird menu the 1 pound burritos were $6 but a standard average joe guy chicken quesadilla was $11. Also had baked potatoes for $2  and ribs for a cool 12 beans. Kind of a real weird menu. Nice atmosphere. Classic Mexican guy with a cowboy hat was chilling at the bar to. Came here for a soccer game but didn't have it on or have it available so my girlfriend was a lil disappointed. Would I come back again ? Si , for a beer or a drink if In the neighborhood otherwise probably not. Good service"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken and mushroom burrito! Such a great place for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Meal tasted like dog food. Couldn't even finish. Didn't remotely even come close to authentic Mexican tasting food. Had steak fajitas and they used steakums. Person not on duty came behind the bar and stuck her bare hands in the lettuce and cheese and chips and made herself a salad. Rap music was playing like it was a club!"}
{"text":"Wow.. I haven't been to MexiCasa since 2005, and I was hoping to take my husband there this weekend, but I am not so sure now.. lol   The last time I was there, the portions were huge, the guacamole homemade right in front of us (we sat at the bar area)  Seems a lot has changed since 2005.  :( 

If any of you \"Authentic\" Mexican food lovers want a meal that is worth raving about, please, please visit El Campesino in Monroeville!!  Their food is awesome... authentic, and the prices are so good, you feel like you are stealing from them, seriously!  I can't speak for any of the other El Camps in the area, but the one in Monroeville is a complete staple for me and my  honey, we had our first date there, got engaged there, and continue to go there for a wonderful meal every chance we get!  :)  Plan on visiting them soon!!"}
{"text":"Good Place to drink, nice atmosphere, layout is a bit strange, 

I would suggest a good place to meet for drinks."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Tex-Mex, Mexi-Casa is the place. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food, Mexi-Casa is not the place. It's very Americanized food. Not wonderful, but not terrible. We came for some sangria which was delicious. They offer three different types. The bartender was lovely and very helpful. My friend has spicy chicken tacos and I had beef tacos. It's about the equivalent of something you could make at home. We also got the three dip special. Guacamole and salsa were great, but avoid the queso. It's the same bright yellow cheese dip that comes from a large can. Mexi-Casa is convenient for drinks; I could take or leave the food."}
{"text":"who else to make the best mexican food but a greek guy?  this place is buried in plain sight in dormont on west liberty.  started out as a little burrito stand and is now a full blown mexican restaurant.  excellent menu and vast selection of hot sauces.  great bar.  anything from this place is as good as it gets.  fresh home made guac too."}
{"text":"This is my favorite quasi-Mexican restaurant in the city. It is not entirely authentic, so don't expect that, but it is good. I personally enjoy big burritos that are stuffed and wrapped in foil (seriously, no sarcasm here) with a nice selection of beer. I highly, highly recommend their pulled pork or Acapulco burrito!

They also have awesome daily specials on drinks and it is just an all-around chill place to hang out with friends. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Was opened by an amazing couple from Texas who had home made food, best wings in town, and was BYOB...  Then they sold it.  

If you are thinking of going here, just go to taco bell...  If you were going to drink here, take a sip of Mrs. T's sour mix and Listerine at the same time..."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good Mexican food in Pittsburgh, but Mexi Casa is probably the worst. I cannot begin to tell you how disgusting the fajitas are. For $16 you get 4 tortillas, boiled beef, lettuce, flavorless cheese, peppers, onions, 1/2 lb. sour cream and NO SALSA OF ANY KIND, NO RICE, NO BEANS. If you want salsa, you have to order it as a side! My husband, who's not a picky eater, could not finish them. The burritos are bland as well. When you order black beans you get exactly that... black beans straight from a can. I can't even believe they dare to serve that and call it a side. The only thing that is decent is the Southwest Platter, but that doesn't make up for the rest. Terrible, overpriced \"Mexican\" food. If you're in the area, go to Mad Mex instead. Heck, even Chipotle is better than this place."}
{"text":"In the past few months,Mexicasa has gotten just horrible,not that I thought they were ever good,they have gotten worse.However,it did force me to looks else were,and I found a gem a few miles down the road in Beechview,Casa Rasta,it is BYOB,and great food. Also in Beechview,at IGA grocery store,on the sidewalk,the best tacos I've ever eaten.Homemade,all fresh ingredients,delicious, and only two dollars.I suggest you find a curb to sit and eat,the tacos don't travel well,gets a bit soggy when you get them home."}
{"text":"Mexi-Casa is what I consider to be an A-OK local neighborhood joint.  The owner is friendly, the clientele are overall nice, and the food is good (read not great).

Grilled whole wings (great deal during the late night 1/2 off deal), ribs, and burritos all have been good.  The portions are generally huge so you definitely won't leave hungry.

Beer selection features a decent variety of crafts, with the only problem being that the drink menu, dinner menu, and draft board all never match (be prepared to just ask the server if what you want is available).

If I had to sum up Mexi-Casa, take Mad Mex and yinzer it down a level...  not exactly a bad thing."}
{"text":"Incorrectly labeled as Mexican food. It's not. This is American food with Mexican flavors.  I feel sorry for Dormont/South Hills people that don't know any better and think this is Mexican food.  I don't think they claim to be proper Mexican food but, I don't like that they even use the 'Mexi' in the name .  Have been here 3 times and it's just kind of 'meh' every time ."}
{"text":"Cerveza, por favor??

Mexi Casa is a restaurant in Dormont right off of West Liberty Ave that feels more like a bar when you swing open their door. But, trust me. It is a restaurant. 

Mexi Casa includes a tiny dining room, a bar, and a plethora of Mexican themed colors and posters. You have the option of grabbing a seat at the regular bar, or posting up at the dining room bar, where you can literally watch your food be prepared in front of you.

My dream of a burrito at this unethical cantina is the Theo Burrito: grilled steak, con queso sauce (melted, spicy cheese),  and grilled onions and peppers all wrapped up in a tortilla. It's pure bliss. 
***Make sure you ask for the Cholula, which is a MUST if you like hot sauce.

Definitely go on Wednesdays when they have $2 import bottles, including my go-to Mexican beers : Negra modelo, Sol, Corona, and Pacifico. 

Warning: this place is NOT a Bar. They close around 10:30 pm and won't be afraid to make you and your buddies feel extremely awkward by being the only people there. So do avoid going to Mexi Casa if your thinking about staying out late, because they practically throw you out of the place when they feel it's time to close."}
{"text":"A Living Social deal finally got me here and I was pleasantly surprised.  My burrito contained spicy chicken, queso, hot sauce, rice and beans and it was very flavorful.  The margaritas weren't too bad, either!  My gift certificate was worth $30 and my friend and I got guacamole with chips, 2 burritos and dessert in order to use the full amount.  If I'm ever in the neighborhood, I'll definitely stop by again.  Especially if it's a Monday when the specials are $3 Cuervo margaritas and $5 burritos.  

A warning to those looking for true Mexican food: Mexi-Casa promotes itself as Pittsburgh's Least Authentic Mexican Restaurant.  I give it 4 stars for what it is - good and cheap food in a place that proudly celebrates Phil Collin's birthday."}
{"text":"Theo, you amazing glorious bastard, you! Theo owns the place. Good little balding Greek boy turns our Mexican inspired cuisine that's as good as my mama's home-made pierogis... which I know none of you have had, but trust me they're good.

I've been going to Mexi-Casa with my wife, teacher friends, and family since near when he opened. What got me hooked wasn't the food but the fact that he and a couple of friends did ALL the work on building the interior. I got to sit on one side and shove mongo con queso shrimp burritos down my gullet while watching him toil away on building the bar from scratch. And since he finished the bar, my wife and I have found ourselves staggering out of the place on a large number of \"holy crap my students are going to turn out to be serial killers, I just know it\" Fridays. 

The food is not traditional Mexican or even traditional tex-mex. But that doesn't mean it's not good. Consider for a moment the simple yet inspired chicken and rice bowl, which its verdant hues composed of a blending of fresh cilantro and parsley into a heady, otherworldly green sauce. The chili has lots of meat chunks and is pretty damned hot, warming you down to your toes. Thank God they have lots of good beer with which to wash it down. Frito pie... chili with Frito's and a piece of jalapeno corn bread... yummy. And the burritos, especially with the con queso sauce made with Rolling Rock beer. Get them mongo (double meat) and pick one of the hotter hot sauces from the hot sauce bar (like the always popular \"So hot your man junk will fall off\" sauce), and be prepared to feel like you're on the winning end of a Man v. Food episode: bloated, carb high, and happy. 

You are a god among men, Theo."}
{"text":"We had good service for lunch. The Chicken Tortilla soup was unique. The wings were forgettable."}
{"text":"I could sit here all day and tell you the great things about Mexi-Casa.  I was really disappointed when they shut down last year, but the wait to re-open was absolutely worth it. Everything is basically the same as it was before, only SO much better now!  The management is responsive to customers and does a great job of keeping things interesting; really good daily specials, seasonal drinks and food items, TONS of different beers rotating on draft.  Everyone that works there is super friendly, and I think the fact that there are clearly a bunch of regulars speaks volumes.   
Mexi-Casa doesn't claim to be authentic mexican, so please don't expect that when visiting.  The burritos are amazing, as is really anything else on the menu and they will make it your way too.  New on the menu are fish tacos, and the tilapia is my new favorite.  The guacamole and queso are both some of the best I've ever had!  I already mentioned the rotating beer selection which is great, but those margaritas!  I wish I had one now =)"}
{"text":"Called beforehand and was told kitchen closed at midnight on Saturday's. Showed up at 10pm for drinks and food before a show and the kitchen was closed."}
{"text":"What self respecting  bar doesn't  have vermouth!!?  Weird!  

Bartenders were very pleasant.  Didn't eat but others food looked and smelled good."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great drink/food specials and atmosphere. The service is great and have a customer oriented focus."}
{"text":"A fun place! It's a very casual Mexican joint with Mexican bar food. Amazing margaritas, and if you like spicy food, the Wanna Iguana Burrito cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"This place has re-opened, I'm happy to report.  Solid burritos and service for cheap.  Good beer selection. Talked with one of the managers last night who said they are working on improving over the way things had been prior to closing (there was a sudden decline shortly before the temporary end) - better quality ingredients in particular.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"save your money and go to Chipotle.  the place is dirty and cramped,  the margarita mix is from a bottle and the \"cheese\" is totally canned... like, picture nachos and cheese at a high school football game.    i'd rather have Chipotle take out and make margaritas at home!"}
{"text":"Went there for Taco Tuesday and really enjoyed myself. The tacos are great, the margaritas are amazing and there are a ton of different flavors to choose from. Our server was very attentive and friendly. One word to the wise: the guacamole is VERY spicy. Personal opinion is that they should warn you about that. Other than that, loved everything!"}
{"text":"Margaritas and mini burritos 
Very good service and a good vibe place, tables to eat  with a small bar, then the next room a few tables and a long bar.  Good speacials as well daily. Theres nothing to dislike here."}
{"text":"Terrible Mexican food..nothing authentic here...their \"Con Queso\" cheese sauce is disgusting, You can get better nacho cheese from a little league baseball park."}
{"text":"On my last visit, I had the tofu quesadilla and split a basket of chips with three dips with my boyfriend. The guac and salsa were good, but I would eat the queso with a spoon if it were socially acceptable. They have a good draft beer selection but I've never been able to resist the margaritas. We were there for $3 Cuervo margaritas and they didn't skimp on the tequila--two was enough for me. I love that they offer tofu (or vegetables) so I can eat vegetarian without having to do any special requests or modifications. Also I can always find close street parking, which is a plus of Dormont over some of the more crowded city neighborhoods. I usually go on weeknights and have no trouble getting a table for two or a couple of seats at the bar. The bar area is lively but not out of control, and the bartenders were friendly and attentive. Overall a very welcoming, fun place to hang out and get some good food and a few drinks."}
{"text":"If West Liberty Avenue became more developed, I think this place would stay around.  Very good food and service.  Good beer"}
{"text":"Don't accept the reviews. This place has since closed and re-opened. 

Phenomenal service. Never have I ever seen a bartender so kind as Jill. She seriously makes coming here a good time. 

The specials are always good. And pirates fans get great deals during games. $1 tacos on Tuesdays? How can you beat it? 

The house of Mexicans is one of the best spots in Dormont. It's not trashy like Vasta, but not too pricey like Cains. It's just perfect. 

Love it. Get the guacamole. It's made in house. It'll make you sour cream your pants."}
{"text":"I enjoy visiting MC and was really excited when they reopened a few months ago. They'll make a burrito exactly how you want it, which, as a picky sometimes gluten/dairy free eater, I really appreciate it. My special tofu, mushroom and grilled veggie naked burrito is making my mouth water just thinking about it! (I love their rice too!) The staff are super personable and will remember your face if you're a repeat customer. 

Give this place another shot. They've had some growing pains over the years with a management change/closing/reopening but they're here for the long haul and willing to make changes to keep our bellies full and happy!"}
{"text":"Defintely not great food. The tastiest thing on the menu is the salsa. It clearly tastes homemade. It's so good, I'm ok with seeing it in a tiny plastic cup on the side. Prices are inflated and do not reflect the small, lacking in ingredients options, that are all served with plastic utensils and in plastic baskets. After 10 the place pretty much turns into a bar, with a very limited food selection and the dining area closed off. And it doesn't morph into a very good one either; it becomes a small, crowded room lacking music or anything resembling entertainment, for that matter. I gave it 2 stars because my hip server was efficient and friendly, and because their Margarita selection is unique and enticing."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  We were driving through Dormont, saw all of the neon lights and turned around to check it out.  There was a \"Victory\" sign, which is a sign of excellent Pennsylvania beer, and after living in Southern California for eight years, I became quite the Mexican food junkie.  About a mile up the road is the place where I got my first sampling of Mexican Food in the 70s, Jose and Tony's, which has lost its luster under the new ownership, so Mexi-Casa sounded like our new hope in my old stomping ground.

Well, they did have good beer on tap - ONE good beer.  Victory Hop Devil is an old favorite, and I buy it often.  There was something not quite right about the 22-ounce Hop Devil that I was served. (Besides the whopping $7.25 purchase price...)  It didn't taste right, and I know what it's supposed to taste like.

The menu got my hopes up.  It was quite extensive, and I quickly decided on the \"Soon-To-Be-Famous\" steak burrito, because nobody can resist advertising like that.  My partner got a trio of tacos - grilled chicken, taco meat, and steak.

While we were waiting for our food to be prepared, we munched a basket of tortilla chips and salsa, which I immediately identified as being produced by Reyna Foods in the Strip District.  Yay!  Reyna makes the best chips and salsa in the city.  SCORE!  We loved the chips and salsa and didn't mind paying $5.50.  My partner's margarita was pretty good, but the bartender looked at us with a blank stare on her face when I asked if she could get us a BLUE margarita, my favorite drink up the street at Jose and Tony's.  Nope.

When the food arrived, I admired the presentation, but was quickly disappointed, because despite the fact that my burrito was quite a handful, it was absolutely the most bland tasting burrito I had ever had.  All I could taste was virtually unseasoned rice and a very large amount of refried beans.  The steak inside had zero flavor, and I had to pile on large amounts of the Reyna salsa to get any flavor at all.  Unseasoned meat piled up with rice and beans in a large flour tortilla does NOT a burrito make...

My partner's tacos were three different meats, but were virtually indistinguishable.  The ingredients had virtually no seasoning whatsoever.  In fact, we shared quite a snicker when we looked inside the \"steak\" taco, which was highlighted by little strips of sliced up \"Steak-Ums,\" totally unseasoned, overcooked, cardboard pieces of \"meat.\"

Well, the people working there were very nice, and they had a pretty good crowd when we walked in.  I decided that I will give this place another chance and try something else on the menu next time, but it is my sincere hope that in the meantime, someone will bring the blandness factor to the owner's attention.  Even if my bill had been half of what it was, I would have walked out thoroughly dissatisfied, because the place is actually pretty nice, and the servers are very nice, and it's in one of my favorite parts of town.  It really deserves one-and-a-half stars for tonight, anyway...

I would have given this dining experience a SINGLE star had it not been for the fact that the people working there were so friendly."}
{"text":"Bad food and bad drinks.
I'm serious.  Don't come here.
Worst joint in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place...good grief. I have lived in Dormont for 5 years. So I had eaten at Mexi Casa when it was under original ownership. It really wasn't bad for American style Mexican food. The food was a little inconsistent but I was never expecting top notch Tex Mex. When I had heard it reopened I was excited to see what improvements were made. Unfortunately, somehow this mediocre place became awful. My roommate and I were a little late but we're really craving a Bloody Mary. What we got was no more than tomato juice with pepper in it. I didn't taste any vodka at all. For $8, I would at least expect some celery salt or horseradish. If the bartender didn't have the ingredients to make the drinks we would have been happier picking something else.

Our food made the drinks seem impressive. I ordered the \"wanna iguana\" burrito. The description says that it has spicy chicken, queso, rice and beans. I opted out of the beans just because sometimes I feel that they tend to take over the burrito. The burrito was disgusting. The queso was too thin and just saturated everything. The chicken was also texturally similar to that from a can. There was not an ounce of spice to it either. The oddest part about the burrito is that the rice had corn and peas in it. PEAS. Weird. I have been to actual Mexican restaurants where they use several vegetables that one would not expect. My great grandmother put potatoes in her beef enchiladas. But this is not a place where creative cooking is expected so it just seemed more like the rice was a mix with dehydrated corn and peas in it. Overall I am saddened by this place."}
{"text":"Loved the staff! Very friendly. Awesome margaritas! Looked like they have a great outdoor space. Went on taco Tuesday, tacos were great. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We got the Wanna Iguana burrito and an order of shrimp tacos, 2 cups of chicken tortilla soup, a Margarita and an American Mule.  The shrimp tacos were okay, but the taco shells were stale.  They came with a cup of black bean and corn salad which I just ended up mixing with the slaw and shrimp and ate it like a salad.  My husbands burrito was okay.  It gets soggy so be careful cutting into it as you'll end up eating the paper at the bottom of the plastic basket they serve it in.  The drinks.....for $8 where was the alcohol?  Seriously they should be ashamed to serve $8 drinks with no alcohol in them.  I mean, I don't need a flammable level of booze, but the booze in a mixed drink is part of the flavor.  My Mule tasted weird, like a sweet flat something on ice.  It took me a awhile to figure out it tasted like flat ginger ale. A mule contains ginger beer, not ginger ale!  It definitely makes a difference.  On a positive, the servers and staff were nice, and they play a good mix of music from the bar on the other side.  The chicken soup and jalape√±o cornbread were excellent!   Unfortunately, this meal was $46 before tip.   We won't head back as I'm not cool with paying tourist level prices for food this mediocre."}
{"text":"A neighborhood staple had returned and I could not be happier.  I feel the little 'hiatus' made me love them more!   Same atmosphere and awesome beer selection with the un-authentic TexMex that we all know and love. 

Wanna Iguana is still my favorite burrito - spicy and delicious.   Cannot wait to come back and get my cajun wings or dig in to some $1 tacos.

It feels good to be back in my old neighborhood bar... almost like we never left.  My stomach thanks you for coming back to Dormont."}
{"text":"Had the Queso and Chips with Chorizo for an appetizer, very good!!!! I had the make it yourself burrito with Pulled Pork, black beans, grilled onions and peppers. Inside was great, the burrito needed to be finished on the grill on both sides, was gummy. GF had the Chorizo burrito, same thing, inside was great, outside needed to be grilled for a little bit. Overall good, will go back."}
{"text":"My 2nd home,  Great Tex-Mex food and home to the best bartender in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I'm writing my review while stuffing my face with an ENORMOUS platter of nachos.   My battery is almost dead but I had to check in and tell you YUM. I'm a long time fan if this place and was heartbroken when it closed.   Ecstatic when a new owner took it over and they reopened. BETTER THAT EVER!  I had a taste of the spicy chicken and FELL IN LOVE.  For dinner I ordered the spicy chicken quesadilla's.   I'm so thankful for to go boxes. EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"The good: 

I had a spicy chicken burrito and added sour cream and guac.  The burrito was delicious, the price wasn't bad, and the place seemed clean.

The bad:  

I asked for chips and salsa without checking the price.  (My mistake)  Prior to their arrival I looked and it was almost $6.  I was a little bummed at that point, but it got worse.  The chips were not the restaurant quality type that you would expect, especially since they were not complimentary with the meal.  So they were extra salty, a little thick, and more crunchy than crispy.  They were definitely room temperature.  The salsa was truly shameful to anyone who's had real salsa, or at least salsa made by someone who cared a little.  Most salsas sold in jars have way more flavor.  This pairing should definitely have been free.  I'd be embarrassed to charge for it.  Rant over."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an impromptu lunch on a late Friday afternoon. The place was empty. We sat at the bar, the bartender was very nice. Their prices are higher than you'd expect for Mexican food especially at lunch time. We ordered the fajita quesadilla with steak and meat chili that doesn't contain beans (? but they added them for us) and spicy cornbread. The cornbread was perfect - moist with a little heat. The chili was lukewarm, and I like my chili hot. I did not ask for them to heat it up in their microwave bc we never use microwaves and certainly don't expect use of microwave when dining out. The quesadilla came with small chips and salsa, otherwise you have to order chips and salsa for around $6 which is steep, since most Mexican restaurants complimentary chips and salsa is a given staple! Also no rice included. Despite the friendly staff, I would not come back here."}
{"text":"I tried. I really, really tried.

Did this place go under new management or something? The last time I went here was about 3-4 years ago and I remember it being pretty good. That was definitely not the case when I made not one, but two, trips in the past 4 weeks.

My first trip was in early March. I had a craving for some Mexican and realized I hadn't been to Mexi-Casa in years and ventured up. The service was a little slow (but the server was very nice, so it made up for it), but the food. Oh my. I ordered a steak quesadilla and it was awful. I typically do not complain about food unless there is really a reason to do so and in this case, something has to be said. The reviews above that mention the poor quality of the steak are 100% accurate. My quesadilla was nothing but flavor-less, fatty, old steak-um \"meat\" smothered in an over abundance of cheese and a soggy tortilla. The second I picked it up, cheese was over flowing out and the tortilla was falling apart. 

I couldn't believe how terrible it was so I went back again yesterday (4/30/14) in hopes my awful trip in March was a fluke. Unfortunately, it was not a fluke. This time, I sat in the bar area with my friend where the food is cooked. My experience this time was even worse and just put the nail in the coffin in regards to me never coming back again. SLOW and RUDE service kicked off the entire experience. The waitress behind the bar (short-ish brown hair, petite) was rude and forgetful from the start. Our food took forever to arrive (as we watched the cook make plates for people who ordered after us), our drinks even longer and zero server etiquette. When we needed something, we always had to flag her down. She never once asked if the food was okay or if we needed anything. No thank you. Nothing. I don't ask much and I understand that people have a bad day or two. But you cannot even check in to see if I am enjoying my food or need a napkin? And I was not the only patron who felt this way. Same deal with the food as last time as well. Soggy tortilla, ridiculous amount of cheese and zero flavor.

Also, a little note to the cook: don't use the same tongs you use to flip chicken and rips to touch a vegetarian's food. Basic culinary rule, there...

I've just given them more than enough chances to be a half-decent place and they just aren't. Maybe I will stop by for a Margarita some time, but never again for the food. I don't think this place is going to last much longer if they continue to not correct their issues. It's a shame because this place used to be great. Anyone know what may have happened?"}
{"text":"For a few months I frequented Mexi Casa every Tuesday for $1 tacos, but I've not gone in a while. Something terrible must have happened. My boyfriend and I ordered takeout from them tonight and I was very very disappointed. 

I ordered a steak burrito with black beans and added peppers and onions. For the burrito it was $9 probably $10 with tax, and I have to say I like the steak burrito from Chipotle better. First, it tasted like it was made with Kraft singles American cheese, and the \"steak\" resembled steak-ums. My boyfriend ordered a buffalo chicken quesadilla and was very disappointed by its size. Very small. We also ordered chicken quesadilla soup. It was mediocre at best. 

I really wanted to like it since it's local and right down the street, but we probably won't be ordering from Mexi Casa again any time soon."}
{"text":"A return stop to Mexi-Casa was beyond overdue, especially considering the bundle of poor reviews that were written since my last visit, so here I came for a to-go meal. 

In all fairness, I am tempted to knock off a single star for the underseasoned ground beef that filled the tacos (Dear old Dad felt the same way), but with such a refreshing, effulgently red, cilantro-blessed salsa at hand, who really needs salt, pepper, or spices? Loaded with a blend of shredded cheeses and wrapped in velvety tortillas that could lovingly blanket infants, Mexi-Casa's tacos are as satiating as they are gratifying. 

The Acapulco Burrito is obscenely humongous and therefore requires no appetizers or sides. This burrito is rough trade, hefty as a rhino, and is almost overglutted with pulled pork, rice, lettuce, cheese, and even two cuts of grilled pineapple. The gob of pulled pork was juicy, full-bodied, and was complimented by the caramelized rings of yellow citrus. The fellow manning the grill seemingly labored to fold the burrito into a neat parcel, smiling at me as he packed that soft tortilla to its limits, silently assuring me that I was in for a generous culinary treat. 

It was so massive, it eventually burst! Rice and pork were scattered about the styrofoam container, but at this point, the burrito was close to a memory, and I finished the remnants eagerly with a fork. 

Mom's Steak Quesadilla was another smooth, meaty, cheesy triumph. Strands of dairy product formed as I pulled each triangle away from my teeth, salsa and sour cream topping each pleasureable cut. 

I genuinely (and we all know that genuineness is out of vogue in the Yelpiverse) enjoyed Mexi-Casa's food this clammy evening as much as I did the first time around, and the place was doing brisk, brisk business. What they offer is as good as any of the better Mexican restaurants in the city that I have been to, and that includes places that are unmistakably owned/operated by people of Latin descent. 

Now to address some of the dumber, meaner, cheaper, more misrepresentative reviews.

I did not find the place to be \"dirty\" or \"cramped\" at all, and the decor was as offbeat, colorful, and tasteful as I recalled it to be.  

They close at midnight, not 10:30. 

It is a bar AND restaurant. A business can be both at once. 

I don't see how Taco Bell is better than Mexi-Casa. Then again, I don't hold a grudge against the current owners and did not know the original proprietors personally. 

Mexi-Casa itself states on their website that they do not make authentic Mexican food, whatever that entails. Move to Mexico if you cannot deal with that.  

Not every Mexican restaurant can or has to serve corn tortillas. I do not know how that rule originated. 

None of the diners I saw were eating from styrofoam plates. 

*sigh*"}
{"text":"I went to Mexi-Casa last week. Let me tell you how excited I was to go to my local Mexican restaurant in good ole Dormont. I had come when they first opened and wasn't happy with the service and couldn't eat much because I am allergic to flour and there were no corn tortillas. I figured time had passed and it takes time for restaurants to get into a rhythm. I optimistically thought they must have just been out of the tortillas.

Wrong. I was shocked by how little had changed as well as a number of other things. One, THERE ARE NO CORN TORTILLAS IN A MEXICAN FREAKING RESTAURANT. This bothers me on a number of levels. One, IT IS A MEXICAN RESTAURANT. It makes me wonder if the owner has ever been to Mexico or even to a taco truck in Miami. Two, I am allergic to flour. I love Mexican restaurants because it is USUALLY so easy for me to order. Three, I like corn tortillas. You don't have to be authentic to just have the tortillas frozen somewhere for that person who like Mexican food to be a little more like Mexican food. I am cool with Tex/Pit- Mex, but seriously, this is ridiculous. 

So, we got the nachos. Which was a bunch of American cheese literally dumped on the nachos, black olives from a can, and some pretty good shredded chicken. There wasn't any salsa, jalapenos, sour cream, nothing. Then, the kicker is that she charged us a dollar for the ridiculously small helping of salsa we requested. This crappy nacho order cost ten dollars. WOW.

Oh, did I mention that we were given STYROFOAM PLATES. I mean, do they even make that shit anymore????

I love Dormont. I am trying really hard to support its businesses, but Mexi-Casa is making it really hard."}
{"text":"I've been to plenty of mex-American places around the city and was not impressed. They don't offer authentic soft corn tortillas and the food was mediocre at best. 

Service was fantastic and the American version of the food was acceptable. 

I give the Rec just for the service. They were all super friendly."}
{"text":"By gosh, these people are just so darn nice,   friendly, eager to please, plus the food and drinks are just so good, you can't go wrong here! The  fact that the prices are good is just a bonus.

My server, Ashley, a petite, happy  blonde, was so nice, very warm and welcoming, that I honestly wanted to ask her to join me. Penny, the other server I had before, is very similar. 

Aside from outstanding service, the hard shell tacos were so crunchy-good, stuffed to the hilt with fresh lettuce, ground beef, shredded cheese and tomatoes, that I was happy to overlook the iceberg they use (I mean, seriously, who's going to trot out the Arugula for a taco?).

On Tuesdays, hard shell tacos are $1/ea. The softshells are$1.50/ea. Granted, I was hungry, but ate 3 hard shells (1 more than usual), leaving absolutely no room for fried icecream (3 flavors), or the Caramel Apple Cheesecake. So bummed, but the really, really good Margarita took the edge off my disappointment.

The fact that for outstanding service, 3 big tacos and a Margarita, my bill was only $10.70  was the cherry on top. (oh, gosh, too stuffed to mention food...)"}
{"text":"I feel as if my review previously was a bit harsh.  While the service still needs help the food deserves a better than one star rating.  With that said, they've been closed for a little while... No idea why."}
{"text":"I love this place, not authentic Mexican food but they don't try to be. The spicy chicken burritos are great and my wife loves the Mexican pizza. If you expect tex-mex going in you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We went as a result of a Living Social coupon or else we would have never gone. The margaritas were a great start! Our  spicy chicken quesadilla and buffalo burrito were very good. My only complaint is that I don't like being served in a plastic basket when I go out to dinner at a restaurant. Just not how I want to dine. Glad I got black beans in my quesadilla as it  really made the meal. We'll go back again. Good food and $3 margs on Thursday night will be a next stop!!"}
{"text":"Good service, good food and good prices.  We ordered a basket of chips and salsa.  Salsa was tasty and fresh.  $1 taco night on Tuesdays.   Tacos were very good, especially for a dollar.  Also tried the Diablo burrito.   Good spice, tasty mix of ingredients."}
{"text":"I've lived in Dormont for 3 years and have never hit this place up. Why? Well, there's absolutely no good reason! I love Mexican food too, so this means there's been a lot of missed opportunities to eat tacos. 

While I feel like there's always a great debate about what's \"authentic\" Mexican food, I always feel like I can't chime in. I know that there are taco's I like, and taco's I don't like. A lot of it for me has to do with flavor. So my knowledge isn't on what's \"authentic\" but what is tasty to me. 

I had the taco platter where you're able to choose from a plethora of different meats. Sadly, this did not include the \"new\" fish tacos, which I was bummed about. I went with the spicy chicken, pulled pork and portobello mushroom. They come dressed with lettuce, cheese and onion, in a flour tortilla (you can also get a hardshell). 

While the mushroom was a little blah, the spicy chicken and pulled pork were awesome. What made them awesome was the meats, of course. They were seasoned fantastically and cooked perfectly. I kept saying over and over how good they were. 

I also had a side of guacamole and salsa. The salsa is more of a pico de gallo, but I dig that kind. I also thought the gauc was very good. Plus, they have a whole wall FULL of hot sauces you can choose from. I'm literally in sauce heaven here!

Their beer list is small, but they have some good drafts, like the Pumpking. I mean, there's nothing like a taco and Pumpking... I kid, I kid. I also kept going back to the drink menu and looking at this Apple Pie cocktail made with moonshine. You're only allowed to order 2 per person, assumably so you don't run down the street naked or something. I threw caution to the wind and ordered one. It was delicious and not once did I taste any kind of alcohol. You definitely could end up in the danger zone. Glad I stuck to one. 

The service was incredibly friendly and I'm excited to make this my new go to Mexican joint in Dormont!"}
{"text":"So, I feel the need to preface this by saying I am originally from southern California. I've been to a ton of \"authentic\" Mexican restaurants. I'm talking full on Mariachi band, goat burritos, and hand written menus. Mexi-Casa has got to be the \"Whitest\" Mexican restaurant I've ever been to.

Typically Mexican joints that aren't run by people of Mexican Heritage are surfer food, big fat burritos stuffed with everything but the kitchen sink. Unfortunately Mexi-casa does not fall into either categories.

I decided to get a burrito, I figure a Mexican restaurant that can't get this staple of Mexican cuisine right is NOT a Mexican restaurant at all. It's hard to describe the flavor of this \"burrito\" as it's honestly like nothing I have ever tasted before. If I had to describe it to someone, I would say they took a stir-fry, shoved it in a tortilla, poured on some hot sauce and called it a burrito. It's really the strangest combination of flavors I've ever digested at a Mexican place.

So, between the soggy overpriced food, slow service, no corn tortillas, and room temperature beer, I don't think I'll be coming here again.

Note to the Chef:
At the very least, melt the freakin' cheese on the burrito before you send it out, mine was still cold from the fridge."}
