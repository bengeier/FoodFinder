{"text":"The food is good, the place is clean, and the staff is friendly. I became an instant Rivas fan after trying what I think is the best chicken burrito in town. Make sure to try the avocado sauce too! Yum! The carne asada fries are an excellent choice as well."}
{"text":"The burritos here are on point and at a great price aswell 2 for $5 can't beat that ."}
{"text":"The food was bland and the red sauce had zero flavor. We had 5 beef taco rolls, containing dry meat and the rolls were covered in a head of lettuce and covered in a oozing, non textured guacamole paste. It's sad when a Mexican food joint makes me wish I'd gone to Robertos. When looking for food around here, walk past this place and go into the BBQ joint behind it."}
{"text":"I received delivery tonight. Mistake!! I didn't get the side of sour cream that I paid for, instead of the nachos I ordered, I only got chips and salsa (last time I checked nachos had at least cheese as well), and the chili relleno was not cooked..the breading was wet and raw (not soggy, I know things can get soggy with delivery, this was raw batter). I will give them credit for their chips, they were light and crispy and not greasy. Maybe things would be different if you actually ate there and could send food back, but for delivery, it was AWFUL. Never again."}
{"text":"Love their chicken soft tacos!! Loaded with chicken, pico and avocado. I also like the fact that their grill is open and you can watch them cook your food. Its by far my fav taco place!"}
{"text":"Wow...just wow. This place is AMAZING . I came in this afternoon to grab some wet shrimp burritos and man ol man is this place the bomb. This was my first time at this location and this franchise as a whole. The lady who took my order was very nice and quite pretty . I grabbed some limes and their amazing spicy avocado salsa, my order was ready quite quickly and smelled amazing . Once I got home it was chow time and it was the best shrimp burrito I have had in YEARS . I ordered a side of chips and dipped them in the wet sauce and shrimp burrito filling. It was at this moment I realized chipotle and cafe rio meant nothing to me. This food is amazing and I can't wait to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"The food is good but They keep upping their prices. They had a good deal with 2 for $5 chicken burritos, then they made it 2 for $6 and now it's 2 for $8 and the burritos aren't even big."}
{"text":"Never Again!   Based on the other reviews here we tried the chicken burrito and chile relleno. Without exaggeration the food was inedible in the case of the chile relleno and almost so with the burrito. After our experience, it's hard to believe that most of the other reviews aren't plants. The relleno was a burned, greasy mess, and the chicken in the burrito seemed to be a mix of reasonably fresh, combined with old, dried out, meat.   I suppose it's possible that we just happened to arrive on a bad day or when the dishwasher was filling in for the regular cook, but nothing could persuade us to give this place another try."}
{"text":"First time trying and their Cali burrito is so yummy. Also the customer service is great, a definite must try!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed when the little BBQ place that once occupied this space closed, and I was perplexed when I noticed that a new Mexican restaurant was opening up in its place. A Roberto's had recently opened up in the same small shopping center. Why would they choose to set up shop so close to the competition? As it turns out, Roberto's is no competition at all. My boyfriend and I decided to check out this new shop and see if the menu looked any good. We had a back up plan... \"If the menu sucks, we'll go to Roberto's.\" We walked up, and checked out the menu through the window (I hate walking into small businesses, making eye contact with the prideful business owner, and walking out. I feel bad, REALLY bad.). All it took was two words and the boyfriend was sold, wet burrito. I had already seen a few things that looked tasty including some fresh salads, fajitas, quesadillas, tacos, nachos, and combo plates. In we went.   We were greeted by a super friendly guy who was all smiles. He had a great energy, and I could tell he was passionate about the food. Upon further inspection of the menu, we discovered something so sinful and amazing that we agreed that there was no way we were getting out of there without giving it a try... Fries. Fries? Yes. Fries. Fries covered in cheese, beans, cream, guacamole, and Mexican salsa with your choice of chicken, steak, or shrimp. YUM! The final order was a wet steak burrito for him, a dry steak burrito for me, and an order of steak fries. I knew it was going to be a ton of food, but I had no idea what was in store for us. The food and two regular drinks came to about $25.00. It might seem kind of pricey, but the fries were NOT an appetizer. They were a meal for two by themselves. After placing our order, he immediately got to work preparing our food. The kitchen was very clean, and everything was prepared fresh to order. I swear that there was nearly an entire cow on the grill. There was that much beef.   As he was cooking, we carried on a conversation. I asked how business was going and he said, \"Everyday it gets better. It's been three weeks, and we're doing good.\" He also shared that there was another location near the Boulevard Mall that has been open for 11 years. Then I asked the dreaded question, \"Is Roberto's giving you guys some competition?\" His reply was a simple, \"No,\" followed by a big smile. I said, \"So your food is THAT good huh?\" Again, he smiled and nodded.   The food was indeed THAT good. The steak fries came out first, and we immediately got to work devouring the delicious mountain of yummy goodness. After our burritos arrived, we moved to the outdoor seating. I will be honest. I never made it to the burrito, but my boyfriend did, and he says it was delicious. He asked me what night of the week should be Rivas night, so we are already planning on becoming regulars. I had to go in and ask for boxes to go, and I can't wait until lunch tomorrow when I will get to try my burrito."}
{"text":"The best mexican food I have had on this side of town. Being our first time we got a very wide variety to share family style. Steak, carnitas and (my favorite) pastor tacos. We also got a steak torta and a wet bean and cheese burrito. everything was wonderful! the salsa from the salsa bar had quite the kick to it but still had great flavor. It was nice to see a mexican restaurant that still has a salsa bar W/ spicy carrots so many others have started skimping on salsa and condiments it was nice to see a place put customer satisfaction first."}
{"text":"First they forgot to include three tacos on our carry out order and then when we got home and realized they were missing we went back. The cashier was rude and said we never ordered them even though our subtotal on the receipt indicated they charged us for them. It was the first thing I ordered when I called my order in so she didn't write them down. She proceeded to DIG IN THE GARBAGE for her copy of the receipt and then without washing hands she went on to assist other customers. GROSS."}
{"text":"I went to check it out and the food was excellent. Restaurant quality with hole in the wall prices."}
{"text":"I ordered the nachos al pastor and they were amazing! I would definitely recommend them to any nacho connoisseur. The restaurant was pretty clean and the staff was friendly enough. I appreciated how they had coke and sidral mundet in glass bottles. (my two fave drinks!)"}
{"text":"Large portions. Food cooked to order and it is not greasy. I was not disappointed. The reviews you saw from my neighbors are correct. I could not finish my portions and it is restaurant quality. The meat was cooked as you order. Some places have their meat precooked. The super nachos rocked it!"}
{"text":"good but don't ever order chicken nachos! horrible, it tasted like old chicken reboiled (yes boiled) in some nasty broth!"}
{"text":"Their chicken burritos are deliciousssssss. Actually their chicken in general is good.  I havnt had anything else from them lol... But this location specifically. I went to another one and it didn't taste the same"}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, delicious, clean, friendly staff. Always been and will continue to be my spot. 10/10 would try again."}
{"text":"First time here not very impressed. Cashier didn't know what she was doing. I got 2 burritos 4 tacos $54??? Are u kidding me. Not until another gentleman came once he heard me asking her why so much. Food wasn't good. No flavor wat so ever to the asada. Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"The food at this place is really good. I have ordered this place of of uber eats before and tonight i decided to reorder it. However. I order guac with my food because i already have chips at home. I ordered a small guac and paid extra for because as we all know guac is extra. I ordered it off of uber eats again because i couldnt leave my house. The delivery guy was super nice however when i realized i didnt get my guac i got pretty sad.   Im more upset because i paid extra for nothing.  i just really wanted some chips and guac. I normally never go back to a place if they mess up my order."}
{"text":"At first i thought their food were awful, BUT I WAS WRONG. I went there this morning and ordered steak fries and steak with rice. They serve a lot too! Food was delicious! I am serious! I was gonna take a picture of it before i eat it, but i was really hungry!..burp..I like how they cooked the steak.! Excellent everything!. Service was great. The lady was really nice. I will go there next time."}
{"text":"Had a 4 Hour wait at the nearby DMV so decided to jump on yelp and find a good place to grab some lunch while waiting. This place popped up with decent reviews and some not, but decided to take the short drive down the street. Upon entering the place looked clean and well maintained and the cashier greeted me and took my order right away. I thought it was cool after i placed my order the cashier jumped behind the grill and started cooking the 3 Carne Asada Tacos i ordered. The salsa bar looked like everything was fresh and not sitting out for days and the sauce and tacos had great flavor.   The bad: Like another review, the steak had a lot of gristle. So i found myself pulling gristle pieces out of my mouth after every bite. Maybe they need to buy better cuts of meat?"}
{"text":"I always judge Mexican restaurants by their brand and rice, which I think are way better than Roberto's and for that reason alone I will keep coming back to Rivas. The menu is a lot like Roberto's but a bit simpler. It's split into different types of tacos, tortas, and quesadillas as well as all the classics.   I loved the idea of being able to choose a meat for my quesadilla so I went with the steak. Let me tell you, it was some high quality meat and I could tell it came straight off the grill. It was tender and not over-salted or over-spiced. Great flavor. The guacamole it came with seemed pre made but I could be wrong.   Naturally I wanted to try a second item to get a little bit of variety during my visit. I went with the al pastor fries. Again the theme continued with the meat--freshly cooked and even a like bit of crispness to it. The only thing I didn't like we're the fries were very very soggy and that's the only reason I'm giving it a four star review.   The salsa bar was very similar to Roberto's but both the red and green had far more flavor and were spicer, which I crave. However, the carrots and jalapeños only had one jalapeño in them, and I always grab 3 or 4 at Roberto's so that's a shame. Hopefully a mistake or something...  Check this place out, it's a great alternative to the 500 Roberto's stores that are here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Decided to hit this spot up after seeing it on yelp and it was probably the best decision of my life. I've been hooked on Rivas ever since. Everything is good here. The steak fries are fire! Best I've ever had. The chicken is sooo good. If you want mexican that's great tasting then I recommend Rivas,  you won't regret it. Better than those jabronis Robertos for sure.   Ps: try the Green sauce it's amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Rivas' a few times and the food is pretty good. The first time I got the carne asada quesadilla. Although it's not my favorite quesadilla, it was pretty big and good. The other times I got the carnitas burrito. Now this was really good. The meat was flavorful and plentiful. I like how they didn't stuff the burrito with beans and rice. That way you could really taste the meat. This has made me end my trips to Roberto's. I was also craving beans, just not in my burrito, so I got a side of it. It was good and flavorful. The restaurant is a tiny place in with a few tables and kind of way out there. I was sort of in the area so no problemo!"}
{"text":"I always go to this Rivas location compared to the one at Dessert Inn. Huge servings & best meats..always fresh! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My family and I eat here often however I must say the prices have gone up and the quality and amount of food hasn't tonight we have 2 carne asada burritos Menudo and taquitos de Res (beef) and let me tell you $7.50 for just meat pico de Gallo it's not worth it seriously Rice and beans are cheap i believe a burrito needs both or at least ones for that prices also I notice they make many mistakes when it's a take out order."}
{"text":"do NOT eat here. I would give this place negative rating if possible. We ordered via UberEATS. 1 order of pastor fries with guacamole on the side. This had Zero flavor except for being overly salty. The pastor was gristly, chewy and undercooked- not safe to eat. Also, did Not receive the guac.  2nd, we ordered 2 enchiladas with rice & beans. Again, the food was way too salty. The cheese was not melted at all- just like clumped into the tortillas and not even cooked. The tortillas were old & stale. We ordered a side of sour cream for .85$ extra which we didn't receive and also paid extra .85$ for onions which were Not added to the enchiladas. This place is a RIP OFF. Their food is too salty. It's undercooked & completely DISGUSTING. We couldn't even eat it, ended up ordering pizza. Such a waste- don't spend your money here."}
{"text":"Bad food , bad service ! Spent $22 and The fish taco I ordered was literally frozen fish sticks with sauce  in a corn tortilla . My soda smelled and tasted like the machine was dirty . I even tried a different soda and it still tasted/smelled like a mildew rag ... So gross ! I mentioned the smell and the girl smelled my drink agreed with me  and said its the machine , then looked at me like sorry oh well . I looked at her like \" well I paid for a soda so ...\"  she reluctantly gave me a bottled drink . She Didn't put an out of order sign on the soda machine so someone could clean it ...  Yeah ,,,,. Pretty nasty . The cashier that took our order was not pleasant , she seemed annoyed . All and all I will never come back here again ."}
{"text":"The food here is really awful. I ordered the veggie nacho style fries and it was a soupy mess. There were hardly any beans and the beans that were there were tasteless. Nothing had any flavor, not even the salsa. The guacamole was runny and the fries were soggy and greasy. I watched the cook in the back appear to make my food so I am genuinely curious as to how my fries were also cold when I opened them 30 seconds after I got them. I have tried a Rivas on Desert Inn and I thoroughly enjoyed the same dish there which is why I tried this location. Unfortunately, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Good and fresh food. They grill carne asada, chicken and shrimp in from of you. It's a good place with good food."}
{"text":"Ordered from UberEATS and the food is delicious! I ordered the shrimp fajitas for myself and the chicken taquitos, fish salad and cheese quesadilla for my family. Everything was very yummy."}
{"text":"I hate to write this review because the steak nachos  used to be so good! i have given this place 5 more tries, but the meat is always not fully cooked chewy and gristle. Just nasty, i even paid for extra cheese, which there was hardly any of. The guacamole here is really bad, its watery,lacks any flavor. Beans not very good either. I wont be back, as i worry about food poisioning because the meat usually is not cooked all the way"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant on the east side hands down. The carne asda fries/nachos and burritos are amazing!"}
{"text":"I enjoy eating here it's probably one of my favorite places to go after school. The prices are a reasonable price and the food is tasty. It also has a wide varity of food and drinks. The only thing I don't like that much is that it opens at 8am and that's the time my school starts and I would like to have a breakfast item before school starts."}
{"text":"WARNING!! For to-go people, make sure you revise your order before leaving the store. They often don't provide meat or other ingredients as advertised in their menu.  Recently, I stopped by Rivas Mexican Restaurant for an order of Asada Fries, and to my surprise my \"Asada Fries\" were ONLY Fries with beans, pico de gallo. I'd called the restaurant RIGHT AWAY and the cashier pretended as if he didn't know how to speak english. He was simply playing a fool because he talked to me in person in english. Afterwards, they disconnected their phone line."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, I wish I could try some of the other items on the menu, but I can't get past the steak super nachos, the only thing I didn't care for was the size of the restaurant, but since I don't go there to eat the size of the restaurant it earned 4 stars easily. I'm saving the last star for when I try something new."}
{"text":"The food looked great when I got it was hot and fresh however after I ate the steak fries I got really sick and my daughter had the cheese enchiladas with rice and beans and she got sick as well I'm shocked because the food looked so good it just didn't agree with our stomachs idk"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The food is always fresh. I haven't had a single dish that wasn't delicious. Make sure to get the green salsa."}
{"text":"You know a place is good when the employees in the surrounding businesses suggest it, unsolicited. I get my hair done next door to Rivas, and there's always at least one stylist eating nachos or a burrito and it's not unusual for the whole store to erupt in arguing over favorite dishes.   The consensus seems to be that the fajitas are the best choice but you can't really go wrong. Their chile relleno is one of the best I've had and their burritos are packed with protein. Ask what's in them though, because the shrimp just comes with pico and guac (and a TON of shrimp!), and I opted to add spinach to fill it out. The enchiladas get really mixed reviews though.   Rivas is a counter service place with very limited seating. Don't leave without hitting up the salsa bar- selection is limited but the red is mild and the green is good for more kick."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best little Mexican restaurant I have been to. My favorite here are the steak fries, WOW! Everything is cooked fresh to order."}
{"text":"WAAAAY better than Roberto's!!  (I ate that Roberto's pig-slop ... sober, in the day time ... when I first arrived in Vegas. Once. Not knowing any better. Yuk, never again.)  The food here is very good, the portions are awesome. Your $7 burrito is going to weigh in at just about a pound !!  In addition to tortas, nachos, fajitas ... they also have menudo, Jarritos, horchata, jamaica, those sorts of items as well.  Not really spicy ... more toward the bland side-of-the-scale. But hot sauce can fix that, of course.  I don't eat here as much as I used to ... simply because the food is just SO heavy, so big! Every burrito ended in a meat coma.   For quick in-and-out mainline Mexican with awesome portion-to-price, this is a good spot to check out."}
{"text":"Got the steak fries and they were very good.  Huge portion of food, Filled the to go tray to the brim. Well go back and try something else."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Rivas for a couple of years now and I have no complaints. The service is always good, the food is always tasty, and the restaurant is always super clean. Recently they expanded their menu, so now there's even more tasty stuff to choose from. I personally love their fries and quesadillas. My only gripe is that the seating arrangement is a little awkward, but I know it can't be helped."}
{"text":"Very good chicken nachos and good breakfast burritos. When a place makes good beans and salsa it makes me very satisfied !"}
{"text":"You know you have a burrito addiction when you walk into a new location of Rivas and the cashier recognizes you -- from another location. Gotta say, it's smart to bring in the experienced staff to ensure your opening goes smoothly.   Rivas Fans will appreciate that the menu is the same, so you can order your regular dishes and they'll turn out just right. My carnitas burrito with cheese was exactly like the one I get regularly at the Desert Inn location. For those unfamiliar with the local chain, the prices are low and the menu is massive. Quality is better than other similar Mexican food spots but my standby choice here (besides the burritos) is the fajitas, while another friend swears by their fish tacos.   NOTE: Their other locations have Eat24 ordering enabled, hopefully this one will too. This location, unlike others, is NOT 24 hours!"}
{"text":"Excellent burritos and great service. The burritos were made with homemade tortillas, tons of meat and perfectly cooked veggies!"}
{"text":"Their service is great, and friendly. Friendly family atmosphere, and more options for different types of tacos, tortas, burritos, and combos than Robertos. While I was there, they gave us complementary fideo...always a bonus. The food is made fresh, so expect a few minutes for your food to cook."}
{"text":"So far i think this place is way better than Roberto's. So it's big plus. It's a fast food place. But for the area since there's nothing Mexican that is worth it I think it's a win win.  The lady at the counter was very friendly The food was tasty. Will definitely come back My only concern was that the fountain drink machine was way too high and for shorties like me makes it very difficult not to spill the drinks."}
{"text":"Visited this new restaurant in Aliante with high hopes!  I was told it was very similar to Robertos and we love Robertos.  Their menu is similar with more meat options.  Same kind of salsa bar.  Service was very friendly,  food took about 20 minutes which seemed kind of long but not too excessive.  Nice open floor plan with lots of seating.  I didn't get any receipt which always makes me nervous.  My food was really good.  The quality of steak is great.  I had one complaint...my nachos had like maybe one teaspoon of cheese.  I posted a pic; there was barely a sprinkling of cheese.  My husband and I laughed that we've never had cheeseless nachos.  They were still okay but would have been better with the appropriate amount of cheese.  The steak combo was good and we really liked the fresh avocado slices on the side.  Super fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"This is thee best Mexican food I've had in Vegas since moving here from Cali! Uber eats only take 15-20 mins to deliver their food to my house. I do however recommend calling them with any special requests if you're ordering from uber eats/postmates. Their Wet Chili Rellano Burritos are absolutely delicious, especially if you add steak! #fatlife #noshameinmyonlinedeliveryservicegame"}
{"text":"Update: ordered the breakfast burrito again and it was SO salty we couldn't even eat it. Not edible. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"I work a block from there. There are so many options on Stephanie, I had never gone left from my office on Warm Springs. I was looking for an authentic Mexican Restaurant. I scored! The parking lot has many spaces... Your car will be in your sight.  The menu was comparable with other restaurants. Prices are lower. Considering I was there at Lunch Rush time, I was amazed at the speed of service, and cleanliness of the restaurant.  Bathroom was also spotless. It's rare to see that. I would love to talk to the Owner about how great their employees are.  Service-5 Stars, Quality of Food-5 Stars, Price-5 Stars, taste- 5 Stars... All around 5 stars! With many locations around town, I'll be sure to visit them all"}
{"text":"Delicious! Love the chicken fries! The fish tacos are phenomenal!   Wait times is about 5-10 mins so very reasonable."}
{"text":"The food here is good and reasonably priced, but the service is pathetic. If you phone in your order or use Uber Eats they will 100% screw it up. We have phoned in 3 times and used Uber 3 or 4 times and it has been wrong EVERY time!!!"}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant and great customer service. I ordered a rolled taco plate with rice and beans. I couldn't finish it due to the high content of salt. Rice was very salty and the beans were okay, the rolled tacos were good, but just too much sodium.  I tried the chicken quesadilla and it was okay, the same as anywhere else."}
{"text":"Been several times and really like their food. It's always fresh and not overly seasoned. Big menu to choose from and price comparative with other mexican restuarants in valley. Staff have always been nice and efficient. It is now by go to when I need authentic mexican meal!"}
{"text":"This place just opened a month ago up by the Smith's in Aliante. I ordered 2 chicken tacos and a carne asada taco. All 3 tacos were really good and packed with lots of flavor. This is a family run business and they seem to care about the customers. They asked me how I liked my meal and also they give you a lot of food for your money. I would recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for great mexican food! They also have Menudo and Posole everyday. I can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"I placed a telephone order for delivery. My order was delivered promptly and every item was delicious.   The food tasted fresh and very authentic and I have no complaints. Watch out, though: The portions are large, so you need to be mindful not to over order unless you want a lot of leftovers."}
{"text":"Two words:  STEAK FRIES  I'll add a little more.  It was a little chilly in there but it's pretty small and with the cold weather one open of the door and it's winter inside.  I can't wait to go back and try some other items on their menu, but the steak fries....yummy!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I go 3-4 times a week, the food is fresh and delicious. I've never had a bad experience! I highly recommend the California burrito!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!! We order from here at least once a week and they have the best chicken burittos and you can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"Go now while the gettins good.  Robertos style menu but higher quality because it's new.  Chicken fajitas was breast meat and cooked well meaning the peppers and onions that came with it were crunchy and cooked well without being soggy and chicken was juicy.  No beans with this combo, rice lacked any fresh veggies as is typical with these quickie mex joints but was excellent in taste and texture and didnt taste like day old stanky rice.  Tortillas were bomb, all food fresh, place clean.  best part of the meal was the green sauce at the salsa bar.  def had a mild heat and prolly a combo of fresh avo and/or sour cream for a nice smooth consistency instead of watery robertos etal. texture.  Good job rivas #4.  glad i stumbled in here since i was at the dq and couldnt get served because a 400 lb behemouth was arguing for over 5 minutes about the consistency of her ice cream."}
{"text":"If I could leave 0 stars I would. The shrimp in my quesadilla were so over cooked I could have bounced them off a wall. I have never had Mexican food with no flavor but if that's what you want this is the place. 30$ for lunch save your money"}
{"text":"We actually love this restaurant and order all the time! I went this morning to get us breakfast for the first time at 7:15. The door states they open at 7. Doors were locked and lights were off. I even went back up to the door 5 mins later and still nothing. I called around 7:40 to see if they were open and someone answered. When I informed the man that I had come by and the doors were locked he argued with me and said \"no, the doors are open\". No apology or anything. Extremely disappointed since this is one of our go to Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Did our order online. The nachos were really good but the steak burrito was very bland. Actually it had very little taste at all. I don't think I will be ordering the burritos again. I will just stick with the nachos"}
{"text":"The al pastor fries were delicious. The meat was super fresh and well-seasoned. The carne asada burrito we ordered was a good size. The meat was flavorful. The salsas were spicy but good.   We paid a little less than 20 dollars for both items but it was worth it. Better than other \"taco shops\" in the area."}
{"text":"This is my go to for Mexican food. You don't know life till you've had a potato taco with there green sauce which I could eat on a flip flop... the staff are always nice and smiling. Hands down best Cali burritos in Vegas they never skimp on the amount of meat and fries that go into there burritos w/that yummy green sauce. I've had so much from there menu but these are my favorites. Mon. and Tues taco days are chicken or potato tacos for $1.00 and have I talked about that green sauce?! Seriously it's all about that green sauce..."}
{"text":"Tried their quesadillas and a taco today. Very delicious. At first i saw the price on the quesadillas and was skeptical, but just like the steak fries, they don't hold back on the quantity and quality! I said in my earlier review that I thought the tacos are overpriced, but the taco i had today was pretty bug for a taco, so i take it back!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! So glad we went here today for lunch. I had shrimp nachos and they definitely don't skimp on the shrimp and it's extremely fresh. Hubby had the steak fries and I'm not a huge fan of steak but theirs wasn't full of grisel which was very nice. My son had chicken tacos and the chicken was fresh and nicely marinated.  We can't wait to go back and try the whole menu. You will wait for your food to be cooked but it's so good it's worth the wait. I think they're definitely better than Roberto's in my opinion."}
{"text":"Best sirloin Carne Asada I've tasted in a very long time. I went with my husband and daughter for dinner and was greated by a very nice huspanic waitress she helped us make our order. We wanted to order family style and share so we got the Carne Asada Fries and the Chicken Fajita plate. We devoured the Carne Asada Fried and took the Chicken Fajita home and ate it the next day. It was very flavorful all lean meats (chicken breast) I will definitely come back again.."}
{"text":"Maybe I stopped in on a bad day, but my steak quesadilla was very bland and plain. No flavor or seasoning. The guac looked like blended baby food  with no thickness . I trashed everything  but the quesadilla  I went two blocks down to the grocery store and bought queso and salsa to add to my quesadilla at home.   Won't be going there again!"}
{"text":"The nachos by far are the best thing to order at Rivas...I have to admit i was a bit disappointed to find out their burritos dont bring rice and beans but nonetheless the meat at this particular location is seasoned great. I went to another location of theirs and the meat was lacking salt. Overall pretty ok spot this one in particular needs more sitting space."}
{"text":"best burritos, best carne asada fries, best tacos and best everythingg!!! employees are so lay back, quick with orders! small restaurant to dine in. great to bring the family."}
{"text":"The tacos and chili rellenos are good and the food is always fresh. The salsa is mild but has good flavor. The staff is always friendly and the place is always clean."}
{"text":"Walking into the restaurant immediately I notice how clean it is and also greeted right as I walk in. I had ordered the Carne Asada Fries, chicken tacos and steak tacos to split with my son and I and my dtr had a regular cheese Quesadillia. It was kind of frustrating that they didn't have a kids menu because my dtr didn't even eat the entire thing.   Well the food portions for all our orders were generous but I would say that it was really pricey. There was a great salsa selection and you can taste the heat and flavor.   The Horchata well it's one of the best by far since getting into Las Vegas. I would walk in and just order that on a daily basis if I could.   A must return, maybe for me and my mister without the kids. :)"}
{"text":"Been eating here since the day they opened. Since I moved away from the area I look for any excuse when I am working the area to eat here. Very fresh, delicious. Roberto's has nothing on these guys, in fact a Roberto's is around the corner and is empty at lunch time. Riva's is legit."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Rivas.  Once again, we stumbled into a restaurant because we were in the area.    I have to say the selection in Rivas was impressive.  They also had more shrimp items than I have seen in many of these kind of Mexican restaurants.  The most expensive shrimp entree I saw was $10.99.  I ended up ordering the shrimp wet burrito.   One of my companions had the pastor nachos and the other had the carnitas wet burrito.  The wet burritos were served with shredded lettuce.  That was okay as the size of the burrito was plenty to fill up the most hungry patron.  The red enchilada sauce was very good.  I was impressed.  However, there could have been a little more sauce poured over that burrito.  It was evident they used large tortillas as the ends had several layers, so a little more sauce (even  just a teaspoon) could have made that wet burrito \"heaven.\"  I did think the shrimp was a bit salty.  After working half way through the burrito it became an issue.  The pastor and carnitas meat were spot on.  The meat was extremely tender. I mean so tender it melted somewhere between my lips and taste buds.  I gave Rivas four stars because their meat was sensational!  The nachos were absolutely yummy!"}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed the food in this joint! To the point that yelp has given me the title of DUKE! Wow lol, but definitely some of the most Mexican fast food joints I been at here in vegas, the quality of the food is superb and by far out does any other Mexican fast food joint around here, I had the carne asada nachos and I ended up licking the plate clean! Truly a magnificent place to have a quick Mexican bite!!!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this location and it's great! I got carnitas fries with extra pico and sour cream. They put them on the side which I thought was a little weird but that's fine. The portions are definitely a little smaller here than the one on East Sahara but it was still too much for me to finish anyway. Just as delicious though! Plus, I saw a snorlax in the parking lot of the Smiths near by so it's cool that there are rarer pokemon near by!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. I recommend this place!!! I always get the shrimp fries or carnitas fries and both blow me away. Their green sauce is extremely spicy but has a really delicious taste. The red is just mild! It's always really clean and it even looks great inside. It's good priced, good service, and they're fast. Try this place and you'll never have fake food again!"}
{"text":"In a city that has an abundance of Mexican restaurants, this is one of the gems that I have discovered.  Mexican is one of my favorite types of food, so to continue to frequent one place really says something.  The menu is typical of a taco shop, with tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos, fries, and others.  I especially enjoy the torta.  They have a great selection of meats for any of their menu items.  Everything is made to order, so during a busy time, it can be a bit slow, but it is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to find out there was a Rivas on my side of town. The first few times I went the food and service was GREAT. The last two times was horrible and due to this very last time I will never in my life go to this location. I ordered 3 burritos and they were all incorrect, I paid 85 cents for each additional condiment. I added beans, sour cream and pico. None of them had what I paid for. I called and the lady sarcastically said I can refund your 85 cents. I was extremely upset due to the fact she didn't even offer to make it right. I asked for my money back, she spoke to the manager and he agreed to refund my money. Once I get to Rivas the cook, the cashier lady, and the manager were at the counter. Not to mention the cashier lady was on a personal call on her cell phone which was so unprofessional. The cook opened the burritos and told the manager he added sour cream but it melts and becomes transparent. Wow really? Who in their right mind would believe that lie. So the manager told the cashier lady to refund my money. Mind you she was still on her personal phone on a call in front of the register not acknowledging me whatsoever. She finally after five minutes gets off her phone and only tries to refund me the amount for the burritos and not the extra condiments I paid for which was in total over $7. I was upset and I said to her excuse me miss you owe me money. She got mad and gave me attitude. When she gave me the correct amount she than threw it on the counter. I understand she's upset but that's a business employees are the front line of the business and what make clients come back. Worse experience ever! If I could give negative stars I would!"}
{"text":"I go here a few times a month. I usually order the shrimp fajitas with a side of beans. The serving is very filling I almost always end up sharing with someone. But that's my opinion! The staff is friendly and the restaurant is always clean. The shrimp fried are also delicious."}
{"text":"!!!EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!  They always have great customer service its always clean but the last time i ordered i got a rolled taco plate and within 2 hours i was throwing up/diahreah and had to go to the hospital for food poisoning. Thats all i had to eat that day so i know it was the food. I felt like i was dying for 2 days but the nausea symptoms lasted for a whole week after. I also.missed 2 days of work. Its unfortunate cause the food was always good and APPEARED fresh. I will never be back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this review is not based on the food. I wanted to try this place due to reviews and found a $10 certificate on restaurant.com. Drove 25 minutes in Friday night traffic to get there just to be told they will not honor it. I understand it's not entirely their fault the website has not removed their information, but they lost a customer over a $10 certificate when they could have had a long term customer."}
{"text":"This local Mexican food spot is so good. One of the few places where I can get posole or menudo any day of the week. And it's all so good. Someone in your party doesn't want Mexican? That's ok. They have other stuff too. Chicken wings, chicken fingers, salads and fried shrimp."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been searching for good Mexican food with delivery.  We tried Rivas, and we're still searching.  We ordered several dishes, all of which should have been based heavily on cheese - cheese enchiladas, steak nachos, shrimp quesadilla, and a chile relleno.  On each dish, the cheese was sparse to non-existent.  Even though the shrimp and steak were pretty good, cutting corners on the cheese really diminished the taste and quality.    The menu is large and varied, so there might be some other dishes that would be quite good.  Maybe we should have tried a burrito or torta, which wouldn't have suffered from the no-cheese problem.  Maybe we should give Rivas another shot.  But seriously, how do you serve a cheese enchilada with almost no cheese flavor?  Side note:  The delivery through Eat 24 was very quick and accurate."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Cashiers are nice, the cooks are quick, and the food is great. Always satisfied when I go here."}
{"text":"Best steak burrito and steak fries. Very fresh and and doesn't leave you feeling greasy and gross afterwards (like Roberto's). It may be a little bit more than your average taco shop but the quality of ingredients is so very apparent! Comparable to Baja Fresh in quality but better and not as expensive. The owner is very sweet and friendly. I love this and am happy that the little BBQ place is gone to be replaced but something so much better."}
{"text":"The best place to go for Mexican if you're in Vegas. Man the food is so bomb. It's super affordable. We did uber eats and got our food within 25 minutes. We got tacos, enchiladas and the steak fries I think it was. And man oh man was it delicious ! I would eat here everyday if I could."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food hands down. Roberto's is honestly garbage compared to Rivas. The food, the condiments and the people are so prefect. I've been to all their locations and it is always great. If you go I recommend the steak fries but everything is good so you can't go wrong. Stop going to Roberto's, if you want quality Mexican food Rivas is where it's at!"}
{"text":"Before this place opened it hung a banner outside that said \"Best Steak Fries In Town\" and I thought to myself that's a bold statement to make for the new TacoShop on the block, they have backed up that bold statement as far is in Henderson is concerned. However, I grew up in San Diego and those are big shoes to fill for sure and I do believe that they could hold their own in and So Cal location. The steak for their steak fries are second to none and that in itself makes Rivas Mexican Grill  in our neighborhood!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered through Uber eats. Got 2 chicken enchiladas, pastor fries, plain nachos, and a large sprite. The enchiladas and fries were good. But the soda was unflavored carbonated water, and \"plain nachos\" is just chips. I figured nachos would at least come with cheese."}
{"text":"I always come here for the steak nacho but tonight i was disappointed i ask not to put beans in my nacho i was so mad and the steak was old meat it was hard and no pico de gallo in the nacho i was more upset i guess the chef was mad working tonight or something i wont be back ever again the nacho was pretty greasy by the way !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I use to like coming here till today. The girl in the front was rude. I understand it's a Mexican restaurant and obviously the employees will speak Spanish but come on, they should know English as well. It's very complicated to ask certain things if the the cashier can't speak English. Second, I ordered my food prior before going, by the time o got there it was ready... okay I understand, shit happens. I waited and by the time I got my carne asada fries, the meat was burnt and fries were old. I truly feel like this was intentionally done. Called to speak to the manger and he was no help. Making me sound as if I was lying about the fries. Why would I lie?!?! I love their carne asada fries!!! So disappointed"}
{"text":"The carne asada fries were okay, they weren't the best carne asada fries I've had. The steak had a lot of fat gross parts in it."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times ..The place is in the Shell shopping center. I found this spot while searching for a Roberto's. I noticed this place while I was pulling up to the Robertos next door. I decided to come in here instead. I like that they are always willing to change up the combo to make it the way I like it. The place is a little small for the amount of business they get and when there is a lot of people inside it can get a little hot. I like that all the meals are made to order, you can  see the whole kitchen and you can see them put fresh steak on the grill and chop it right in front of you. They also have chicken fingers and wings!!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in to grab dinner to go and was impressed with Rivas. The restaurant was really clean and service very friendly. Plenty of seating if you're eating in. Ordered steak fries, carnitas fries, and cheese enchiladas with beans. The steak is tender and has great flavor and the amount of toppings/cheese was just right. Carnitas fries were good but the steak was better. I really liked the cheese enchiladas and beans- grew up eating \"New Mexican\" food from New Mexico and the sauces, beans, and overall taste of Rivas is way closer to that - I know that may sound weird but it's true and reminded me of home. I am so excited to go back and try the posole! This is definitely my new favorite spot for quick Mexican food!  Update: Went back for posole and was a little disappointed... not a whole lot of flavor it was only ok but the biggest problem was bone fragments in the posole - i ended up throwing it out because I couldn't get all of the bone out. I still prefer their food over Robertos and it's still at the top of my to-go list."}
{"text":"I would have to say this place is a three and a half but bordering on three. They have decent chicken tacos and I like their green sauce. They are nachos with guacamole we're definitely not up to par. They put the tiniest bit of cheese on it and the guacamole was just okay. That would have not really been a big deal if it was not $5 and had this liquid like guacamole mixture. They were barely worth $3."}
{"text":"Really good food! I live around the corner from this place and my husband loves their carne asada fries. The prices are a little more than what I'd like to pay, but overall, it's not bad. The wait time for food is acceptable, not exceptional."}
{"text":"Have to confirm my previous review... You can switch out the salsa and guacamole in your burrito for beans and rice. Additionally, this chicken burrito today, knocked me out. After I finished and got home, I live close thank god, I knocked the fuck out. The meat is still good, and they still serve the food hot. The red chile is still hot and the guacamole one has a good tiny kick. I slept for 2 hours. I guess if your head is like, \"Fuck you. We gonna stay up and think about weird shit all night\" order up a burrito and knock out."}
{"text":"Ordered food from here through Uber eats. Ordered the al pastor fries and wasn't really enjoying it. Meat wasn't really cooked all the way. As I started picking though the food because the taste was off I look and find a huge horse fly cooked in the food. Called the restaurant immediately and one of the female workers there was very rude and uncooperative. Told me they don't have flies here and I can't get my money refunded if I went down to the restaurant. Asked for a manager and said I couldn't speak to him because he doesn't speak any English. She then tried to just speak Spanish to me when she herself was just speaking English. She repeatedly just kept saying \"no no no\" to me. My daughter called for my son in law to handle it since she wouldn't bother cooperating with him. At first refused to give us a refund and said Uber needs to refund the money and that it wasn't their problem. Let them know that we will be calling the health department on them for uncooked meat and insects cooked in the food. Went down to the restaurant and the same female worker looked at it as if it wasn't a fly cooked into my food. When you can see wings and all. Had a male worker come up and finally said to give us our refund."}
{"text":"I gave Rivas two stars for the customer service which was good. The lady's are nice but the food is mediocre for the price. They don't seem to have their own flavor. The price is high for what your getting. You could go to a restaurant with some flavor. Disappointing really."}
{"text":"Got our food at around 7pm so not too late to expect fresh food. Instead got a carnitas burrito that tasted rancid. The meat was nasty looking and I could only eat half.   Chicken tacos not much better. Chicken was very dry and almost crumbly, not much flavor.   On top of that they didn't give guac on the side as requested and the soda was flat. I did like the refried beans though, which is odd as I typically just don't."}
{"text":"Ordered my stuff 30 mins ago I was first person here at least 10 people have walked in and gotten their order while I wait.  I must have ordered wrong   Food finally came no explanation food is good however worth another star."}
{"text":"This place is right by my house and I love it! The food has always been good and fresh."}
{"text":"Ordered through UberEats, ordered a steak burrito and a chicken torta.  Both were very bland, hardly any flavor.  The burrito was really small for the price."}
{"text":"Carne Asada fries!!!! These things are so good I inhale them... literally takes me 2 minutes to eat. I also like getting the cane Asada and chicken tacos. Nachos are good too! If your in the east side make sure to check out this place."}
{"text":"I lived in Vegas 17 years and driven by this place at least 1000 times. Today my life changed! This place is THE REAL DEAL! Tacos are huge, Roberto's can't compare to the quality, taste and price Riva's offer. Must try!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to order food from Uber eats. It is very fast and super tasty. I definitely recommend this place in particular the shrimp fajitas. Enjoy"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints my craving of carne asada or chicken fries. Their salsas are great and the are definitely not stingy with their portions. I always come back!"}
{"text":"A-ok! Mom and I stopped in as we were in the area. I had the shrimp taco combo and she had the crispy chicken tacos. There was a generous serving of shrimp on each of my tacos, and the flavor was perfect. Rice was good but I skipped the beans as they were pretty dry. We took home a ham breakfast burrito, but we'll stick to Roberto's for breakfast in the future. This one had onions which a) I'm allergic to and b) are just gross! I think they also used fries (California style), but in this case, it was no good. I also took home carne asada nachos to my husband and he reported that they were just \"okay\". The service was not overly friendly (but not bad either), but the building was hotter than Satan's testicles. I nearly broke a sweat when we were ordering and can't imagine how the cooks were handling it. I think next time we'll take our tacos to go! The menu may be hit or miss, but it hit the spot for my shrimp taco craving, so I'll be back when the hunger strikes again!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time since I work next door, staff is always friendly and helpful, but Iliana takes the cake she is simply amazing and goes out the way to make everyone happy!! I order the pozole, chicken fries, steak fries, and California burrito. They are all huge portions so I take the left overs home to my husband."}
{"text":"We had steak nachos and steak burrito both were so yummy !! This is my favorite new casual Mexican place.  They do charge to use your debit card that's the only reason I gave 4 stars."}
{"text":"Hmm..ive eaten from here twice and both times my stomach was upset after eating.  Too many spices or salt.  I'm not sure which made my stomach churn; probably both."}
{"text":"Had it for breakfast love this place!! The staff very friendly and they have awesome food!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend anyone to get the 2 for $5 burritos with everything in it omg it's soooo good!!!!!  And the horchata....AMAZING."}
{"text":"Carne asada burro had a bite of gristle every other bite, chicken bone in my enchilada plate, rice&beans had zero flavor and inedible, the flour tortilla was the tastiest item of my dinner.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"It was my first time coming in and I got the chicken burrito. it was alright I think I would enjoy the steak but this is way better than robertos for the same price! can't wait to come back and try some other things on the menu, love the location as well."}
{"text":"Hands down best Mexican fast food in town !!....'ing on Roberto's Faustio's and Don Tortaco's !!....yea I said it, and what ?!?!?!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and the staff has been more than accommodating on the specialty requests!  These are guys are an A+ on my book!"}
{"text":"Steak nachos were excellent. Also try rolled tacos & burritos. Ordered from ubereats food always hot & delicious."}
{"text":"This place has the best nachos in town! Everything I've had in the last five years has been great. Rivas Mexican Grill is cleaner, tastier, fresher, and just generally better than Roberto's (which is in the same lot). Yum!"}
{"text":"This is my first visit to Rivas.  The food here is very tasty and fresh.  I walked in here and ordered 2 tacos.  1 steak and 1 shrimp.  I didn't order anything else because I was worried that I wouldn't like the food but I was wrong!   I am mildly allergic to shrimp, but I love shrimp and had to order one lol.  The rash on my face will go away in 1 day so no worries.  I'm glad I went against my health because the shrimp tacos are delish and have great seasoning.  If you try the shrimp on its own it is a bit salty but in the taco, it really makes the flavor stand out and the salt is evened out by the other toppings.  The tacos come with pico de gallo and guacamole.  I am not a fan of pico de gallo since I don't like raw tomatoes.  I asked the cashier if I could get onion and cilantro instead of pico de gallo which are considered \"extra toppings\"(75 cents each) and she said yes :) . When I got my tacos, they had no cilantro and they said they had ran out :( My tacos were still good.  The steak taco was very good as well.  The steak was tender, juicy and seasoned perfectly.  They have a salsa bar and the green salsa is good and spicy( I love spicy food) so beware if you can't handle the heat.  Salsa heat scale 7/10.  For the tacos they use the regular corn tortillas instead of the small taco tortillas.  The tacos are big.  The tortillas are soft so my tacos broke when I was eating the taco (hate it when this happens).  My grandma was always very very picky with the way tortillas are warmed up, and she would not have been happy with Rivas.  Since they were not warmed long enough they broke easily.  The guacamole here is very good and thick which I love.  After I ate my 2 tacos I got up to order one more shrimp taco!  This place is 2 minutes away from my house so if I am really craving these tacos I would stop my here for them.  But for the best Mexican tacos I would go somewhere else.  So far these are my rankings for best tacos(in my opinion) in Vegas.  Keep in mind that I am looking for authentic tasting/looking tacos.   #1- Las Taquizas (Lamb/Bonanza) taco truck #2-El Cordobes (Tropicana/Nellis) #3- Rivas Mexican Grill #4-Taco Tijuana (Forgot the streets/google it) You can see my reviews for all these.  Thank you,  Taco Lady"}
{"text":"Rivas is my go-to Mexican eatery in the immediate area.  The food here is awesome and the staff is always nice and accommodating.  When I roll through, I usually jump on the shrimp torta or shrimp tacos, which I must admit can get a little pricey with my appetite.  However, they have a fantastic 2 for $6 chicken burrito deal that I frequent when I'm hungry or I need something to-go for the day.  Plus, they taste good so that's always a plus.  HEAD'S UP: I would definitely suggest that you phone your orders in before coming as it tends to get busy here and it might take a while to get your food.  Calling my order in 15-20 minutes ahead of time seems to be the trick here when I just want to pop in, get my food, and go.  Condiments in mind, the green sauce is pretty grubbin' but the real winner is the red sauce.  The red sauce made here is the best I've had in the area, if not the entire valley.  They are both a little spicy but that's how I like 'em.. make sure to pick-up a to-go cup of sauce on the way out.  You won't be disappointed.  Good food and a great option when I'm hungry and don't want to drive too far.  Definitely a frequent flyer here and will continue to be for a while."}
{"text":"Went here based on Yelp reviews.....not great.   Food was greasy (it actually dripped)....veggie tacos lacked flavor and the chips were store bought and old. The 'Green Salsa' tasted like it came out of a jar.  I did give them an extra start for the staff.....they were very nice."}
{"text":"Freshest Mexican food on the east side. It's a Robertos style place but the quality is 10x better.  I recommend the shrimp fries. They are worth it."}
{"text":"Food was good but a little expensive for a dive. $7.99 for a chicken quesadilla, no rice or beans.  Friendly service, Tv was so loud it was uncomfortable, staff didn't seem to mind As I'm eating a overwhelming smell of pinesol cleaner overtook the taste of my food.  Between loud TV and cleaner, I won't be back"}
{"text":"Stopped by today, prices on the menu are at least double the advertised menu photo on Yelp's prices. Not paying $9.50 for a burrito sorry. Left and on my way elsewhere. I hate greedy establishments that think Mexican fast food should be expensive. Who pays $7. bucks for a friggin quesadilla lol...not gonna be their sucker! Go to Faustos or Don Tortaco for prices that are 1/2 of this rip off establishment!"}
{"text":"I got a torta with pastor. The meat was tender and flavorful. They have a variety of Mexican food on the menu even chicken wings. You can't leave without  the delicious salsas I would visit again.  Torta: $7.30"}
{"text":"Great chicken tacos!  They have 99 cent chicken taco nights on Monday and Tuesday."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and the food was phenomenal. If your looking for some good authentic Mexican food this is the spot. 100 percent all the way around."}
{"text":"We randomly came here to get a small bite to eat and found great special deals along with an extensive menu.  There were many vegetarian options, and I will say that their bean and cheese quesadilla is the best I ever had.  They use excellent cheeses - and generously -- and the tortillas themselves are soooooo tasty!  They appeared to be freshly made at the restaurant.  We were very happy to find this place!"}
{"text":"Really great food, probably our favorite Mexican food place in Henderson. We usually go for the chicken tacos.  But just after our last trip, probably wouldn't be going anymore cause of the customer service. We order online for the convenience and quick pick up. With the chicken tacos you usually get buy one get one. But I guess if you order online you don't get that. Wish we would've know but it's not advertised anywhere. When we asked they told us it doesn't apply to tablet orders. I wish they would've honored it for us this one time when we were expecting more. We didn't have more time to order more since it's usually a wait for the food. That's why we ordered online for the first time."}
{"text":"Fine if you want another same as everywhere fast \"ish\" Mexican food place.  But a LG drink (32oz) is 3.70 and they only have carbonated water...hmm makes you wonder how they do the dishes.. they absolutely refused to get me a cup of regular water. And the carne asada fries (11.55) were...well.. ordinary.  Not worth the money if you ask me."}
{"text":"I discovered Riva's when I was attending a high school just up the street. It's in the same plaza as Roberto's,so there's a competition. However, Riva's isn't just another chain restaurant. It features authentic mexican food. My absolute favorite is the 2 burritos for $6 deal, and I always get chicken and guac. I'm assuming it's a family owned business because I always see the same workers and cooks.The service is great and once I made a mistake on my order and they fixed it free of charge. I think it's a great place to eat in the neighborhood. :) My favorite mexican place."}
{"text":"GREAT meal after playing in a nearby baseball tournament.  My son left a bag at the restaurant and the operators were kind enough to mail it to our California home.  Highly recommend on many levels!!!"}
{"text":"I love Rivas. The quality you get for a fast food type restaurant is amazing. They have the best chicken nachos!!!"}
{"text":"Food pretty good only gave 4 stars had a restaurant.com coupon they didnt honor.. printed 3 days ago...but other than that pastor  pretty good service was fast food preparation  was pretty quick too... variety  of food on the menu easy to order... conveniently located for us... may come  back.. but rather try another mexican restaurant from restaurant.com that will honor coupons..."}
{"text":"The chicken fries and steak fries are AMAZING!! I've only gotten them using Uber Eats but haven't been disappointed whatsoever!!"}
{"text":"Rivas showed up with five stars on Yelp when I was driving around with my friend.   I read the reviews before so I was glad it came across.   The menu is small which, to me, is a good sign because I believe small menus let establishments focus on keeping core items really good and prices low.  It had salads, quesadillas, super nachos, burritos, wet burritos, rolled tacos. That's all I can remember.  I got the super steak nachos.  These are by far my favorite Carne asada nachos.. better than tacos el gordo! Which i love..  The reason is the steak was freshly grilled, the guacamole was actually thick guacamole, and the beans!  Beans are a filler in my opinion.   Their beans were seasoned perfect and added to the overall flavor combination.  It was a bit hot in the restaurant, which I hate. Also, food came slow but it was a bit busy I guess.  But I overall loved the food.  The cashier was nice but not someone memorable.   The overall experience including service, speed, and food will get a four from me.  Oh yea! There bathrooms were pretty clean haha :]"}
{"text":"I was pretty happy with my breakfast burritos. I got the chorizo burrito and my fiance had the sausage breakfast burrito both with an order of plain fries. He added onion and rice to his burrito. We were both as happy as could be with our orders! The fries aren't very good I wouldn't recommend ordering a side of them as we did. But the burrito is the important part and it was delicious! We had the order delivered so I never saw the store. It was made quickly and had fast delivery through doordash."}
{"text":"I ordered the taco combo which comes with two tacos the picture shows two hard shell tacos but you can get soft tacos which I got. I wanted to get one taco with asada and the other one chicken but apparently they charge you an extra $7 to do two tacos of different meats!!!! Fucking dumb! So I ended up just getting two asada tacos lol cause that shit is a rip off! My tacos were okay I give them a 6 It came with a lot of meat the meat is cut up in big chunks which I am not a big fan of and some of the meat was chewy. It comes with pico de Gallo and Guacamole. Honestly I wouldn't get them again. My bf got the asada fries which I recommend. They're big enough to share with two people and a small child. The fries are crispy! It comes with sour cream, beans, meat, cheese, and pico de Gallo."}
{"text":"Hello!  I placed my first order here via uber eats. I am unimpressed. Ordered fish tacos an there was no sauce (ranch). Called to let them know, and I heard the person tell the chef, then they proceeded to laugh and tell me if I wanted ranch to go get it...  not happy!  Better off going to Roberto's!   Sent from my iPhone"}
{"text":"Tried several items on the menu : Rolled Tacos, Steak Fries, Pastor Nachos. Menu is very similar to Roberto but quality/taste of the meat are better :)  Not sure why they haven't update the web page or yelp but their phone number is (702) 586-2251  for anyone who wants to call in for pickup."}
{"text":"Superb food.  Never greasy.  Clean kitchen.  Price is right!"}
{"text":"Sitting here right now and i have to say I'm so mad i chose Dairy Queen and my girl chose this place !! The food looks, smells, and TASTES delicious. The prices are so reasonable and the customer service is good as well. Area is very clean and you can tell they know what they're doing back there lol. I was scared to eat Mexican food again due to a bad experience i had else where, but I'm sure I'll be back at this place in a week or so. Still a five star place, but i don't like how you have to pay extra for sour cream. Usually, places at least ask if you want it on there, but here they didn't. I just thought it was included. So i didn't want to walk back up and ask for more, but nonetheless, it's a good spot to place in my bookmarks and come again a second and a third time. So thank you !"}
{"text":"My hubby loves this place and was happy that they opened a location near us. I didn't see the big deal at 1st that thought it's just another Robertos. After I tried it, I understood. They use real grilled chicken and beef. The quality of their meet is much better as well. It's clean and really convenient when you order ahead for pick up."}
{"text":"The food here is fresh and the servings are very generous.  The prices are exceptional and will likely go up soon. So far, we've tried the Carne Asada Burritos, Tortas, Chicken Tacos and a combination of other combos.  Every time, the food has been fresh.  It has that fresh cooked flavor, tender meat, and just finger-licking good.   You must try their meals with an ice cold Mexican Coke.  Dios mio! So refreshing.  And of course their guacamole sauce just adds that much more flavor.   Finally, Aliante has an authentic Mexican grill in the community.  We usually drive out to the Craig area for Mexican food but Rivas Mexican Grill just opened up on Aliante Parkway adjacent to the Smiths and we are very happy they have given our community an opportunity to enjoy their fresh grilled food."}
{"text":"I came to this place because I had a certificate from restaurant.com that I purchased on 1/18. I showed it to the cashier prior to ordering and she said I couldn't use it because the manager has already told the site to stop selling them. They have nothing posted anywhere about no longer accepting them. Since everyone was hungry we all ordered.The cashier told us the wait would be a bit. (Only one guy cooking in the back)  My carne asada nachos had a lot of fat and tough pieces off meat that I had to spit out. When my husband went to get a refill of horchata it was $1 and nowhere does it state that they charged for refills. You would think that since they took so long to get the food to us they would at least give a free refill. Now I see why this place isn't rated very high. A little customer service training wouldn't hurt."}
{"text":"Best carne asada nachos in town!!! And their jalapeño/tomatillo salsa..... Amazing. Just amazing. And the employees are very pleasant. Love it!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I was not a fan of this Mexican restaurant for numerous reasons. First off, their service was slow. Not only did it take the cashier a long time to come up to the counter and take my order, the wait to actually get my food was even worse. I spent $20 on a burrito and carne asada fries, which I felt was somewhat outrageous in the first place, but I figured if the food was good then it would be worth it. Nope, the food was just as disappointing as the service. The burrito I ordered literally had thousands of diced onions in it, so much that it overpowered the flavor of anything else that was in the burrito. It was like I was eating an entire onion wrapped in a tortilla. The carne asada fries were OK, but I felt like they barely had any meat on them. Also, both salsas they had at the salsa bar were extremely bland. Not worth putting on your food as it will add zero extra flavor to your dish. I will be avoiding this restaurant in the future as I'd rather spend my money on quality Mexican food with more attentive service."}
{"text":"I love the guacamole and pico de Gallo here. Sope was great but steak was dry and chewy, could've had more flavor. The nachos were great and they are very friendly and fast. I also don't know why Mexican restaurants in the area use yellow shredded cheese. It seems to be a trend not just this place. I want that good white crumble Mexican cheese. Overall this is a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Had the Carne a safari fries and they were pretty good. They are better quality then robertos"}
{"text":"This place is the first meal I had when I moved to Las Vegas. Right next door to my condo and I thought i'd try it till I found something better. 2 years later, still haven't found better. Not for a lack of trying. Food is fresh to order. No heat lamp mystery meat. Fresh meat, to the grill, then straight to your belly. Limited menu, but that means they can do everything exceptionally well."}
{"text":"Carne Asada and Chicken are awesome.  Prices and flavor blows away the nearby competition."}
{"text":"The wife and I moved to area from San Diego. Heard good about this place. The food looked great. We got our order and it was cold. Such a big disappointment. I will continue to look for a \"good spot\""}
{"text":"Super Deliciosa comida."}
{"text":"Don't go to the Roberto's next door, just go here instead. They use fresher ingredients and it tastes better."}
{"text":"First time here. I had the carne asada fries. The meat had really good flavor but majority of the meat was the fatty chewy pieces. And by that I mean the pierces that you can't even break down because they are so tough. Not trying to sound unreasonable, I know to expect a piece or two to be like that but in my case I had to stop eating, I almost threw up because there was one in almost every bite. I wasted half of my meal.    I might try one more time and cross my fingers not too many fatty chewy pieces!!  On a good note I liked the flavor of the meat and the green chilé sauce. The place was clean and people were nice."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the price. They've gone up a bit since I was here last. But it's worth every penny. If I worked closer, I'd be here everyday!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend not going here. The service is terrible, we placed an order on the phone and didn't get what we ordered. The order called for a Steak breakfast burrito, carnitas burrito and steak fries. when picking it up we only got the burritos and the breakfast one wasn't breakfast. Really annoying how i had to drive back and forth to get my order correct. On top of that when i went back for a third time they didn't replace the order for the wrong burrito. We ordered on yelp and not a call in order. Her response every time was \"i didn't hear her say steak burrito.\" same thing goes with the fries. You're better off going to chipotle or roberto's. just saying"}
{"text":"I  have been here twice and some employee practices Will stop me from Co ming back.  Employee went out side, when he returned  he rinsed his finger tip and proceeded back to cooking. Employee needed to cut meat.  He only had on one clove,  grabbed the on the meat with his bare hand and cut it.  I will not be returning.   My health is important to me."}
{"text":"We went for dinner here yesterday as it was walking distance from where we lived. We received their menu in our mailbox and decided what we wanted before we got there. First, I understand the whole \"prices are subject to change without prior notice\" BUT why would I get the menu in the mail the day before and show up to prices that are significantly higher, $2 higher. We ordered an asada torta, which was bland. No real flavor. The wings were okay, they were a little dry. The al pastor quesadilla was not my favorite, the meat was decent but for a quesadilla there wasn't much cheese. I think the best thing we ordered were the asada fries. They were better than the rest of the food, maybe because it had a lot more condiments than the rest, came with beans, tomato, onions, cilantro, cheese and sour cream.  Doubt we will be going back. Place was quiet and clean, but food was for dine-in and placed in take out boxes."}
{"text":"We were really blown away by this place! The day before we had ordered from another mexican restaurant and were not very impressed. Rivas definitely turned our mood right around and we spent just about the same amount of money.   Our order consisted of a chicken quesadilla ($8.84), 2 piece chicken enchilada combo ($6.50), a shrimp taco ($2.85), a steak taco ($2.85), the wet carnitas burrito ($6.70) and an 8oz order of rice and beans ($2.50 each).      Everything was delicious! My favorite would be their shrimp taco and chicken enchiladas. Everything was seasoned well and they didn't hold back on sauce or cheese. And it's always a plus when you order something for delivery and they actually include utensils and napkins (I can't tell you how many times I order delivery and the restaurant does NOT include these little things).  We will definitely be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"Ohh i love this place. I always get the carne asada nachos. The meat is so much fresher and more tasty than robertos. The prices are not expensive for this type of delicous flavor. Must stop by."}
{"text":"1st noticed Rivas when i saw the sign out front for buy 1 get 1 chicken burritos..\"Buy 1 Get  1 free Chicken burritos\" !!!...dont get any better than that in my book...prices are fair and the food has always been good..close to my house definately run through here at least 1 time a week..."}
{"text":"I'm from San Diego so I'm spoiled rotten as far as good mexican but this place is bomb. Order a California burrito but add sour cream. It's good, thank me later."}
{"text":"This place is probably our go to when we don't feel like cooking. It's only a few minutes from home, and the food is soooo much better than Robertos. A bit more pricey but definitely worth it! Always great customer service, and great food!"}
{"text":"I've never been there before but one time I ordered tacos on uber eats and they were just okay... Nothing different.  But... Last time I ordered a California burrito and honestly it was horrible..."}
{"text":"Passed by this place many times before it officially opened and told my husband we had to try it out. After reading rave reviews about the other locations we finally stopped off to get a bite to eat. My husband ordered the bogo free chicken tacos and I ordered the nacho fries plus a horchata to share. I've had them before at Roberto's a couple of times and needless to say the Riva's version was far better. Lot's of flavor, tender steak, guacamole, beans, cheese, and more! What a party in the tummy too. Service was good, food came out in a fast and timely manner. Restaurant was very clean, never went to the restroom so can't comment on that. One thing I'd definitely say to watch out for is your timing. Definitely don't come between 2-3pm or you will run into all the high schoolers from GVR getting out for the day, and let me repeat. The traffic is horrible! Other than that excellent place and food."}
{"text":"Love the food here! Everything I've ever eaten has been amazing but I mostly get steak nachos!"}
{"text":"Normally I reserve 4 stars for places I would bring tourists to.  I would not bring tourists here, simply because there is nothing unique or outstanding about it.  That being said, for ME, it gets 4 stars.  Why?  For one, I actually trust this place to serve me food that is safe to eat. The place was clean, and they cook the meat to order. Some places, especially mom and pop places, sketch me out with their food safety, or lack there-of.  And I have worked in the food industry for years, I know that almost anywhere you eat out, there are things going on in the kitchen you would rather not know about. Second, the service was decent.  It wasn't overy friendly or anything, but it wasn't rude.  Food came out relatively quickly considering it was cooked to order.  I got a chille relleno burrito and a steak taco. I am glad I got the taco because I wasn't a huge fan of the burrito.  But holy guacolmole that taco was yum! Big, not those tiny street tacos you see most places.  Steak was cooked well and seasoned to perfection. No grizzle!  Will def try other steak items from them, like the steak burrito, steak fries,and steak torta.  They are down the road from me and competively priced, so yay!"}
{"text":"I tried them because they are close to my work. I also saw them on postmates and wanted to check it out. I get the carne asada sopes combo. Super yummy. I them ordered them on postmates 5 times since then and I have had no issue. The red sauce is super hot, so don't get it on your hand cause it burns. Also, i noticed a review that mentioned the smell of the soda and machine. Its actually the thick Styrofoam cups they use that smells. I havent noticed any change to the taste of my Coke."}
{"text":"Came here for the steak fries after reading the reviews. Food was served quickly and everything tasted pretty good and seemed fresh. The portion size was crazy--way too much to eat. I definitely want to come back and try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"My first time at Rivas Mexican grill. It was delicious don't get me wrong but I was very upset how they charge you for every little thing me and my wife always share a drink we don't drink a lot so the lady at the counter said you guys can't share you have to buy another cup. From that point she made me feel very uncomfortable cause I never ever been told that not even Roberto's ,Olive Garden ,casa Don Juan give me problems. But I won't be going back anymore"}
{"text":"I came here because of the positive reviews, and I am very disappointed. The beans are bland, and the guacamole tasted like frozen, prepackaged, processed avocado. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Love coming here for lunch! The staff is always helpful and friendly. Food never disappoints. Everyone at my office eats her on a regular basis"}
{"text":"Rivas awesome better than Robertos & always friendly staff. Little more pricey but delicious & get the bang for your buck. Shrimp tacos yummy & carne asada fries are on fire!!"}
{"text":"I live 3 mins away from Rivas Mexican grill.. I am from Mexico City.. I know what a really good taco , meat, or an authentic Mexican plate tastes like.: I really recommend this place to eat: Robertos , pepes, and tacos el Gordo have nothing on this place. This place is clean and they prep and cook the meat in front on you. Other places have everything frozen and the quality of the met is really bad:: You can taste the difference on a carne asana fries from Rivas and pepes. Taste its way better and unique at Rivas. Been from Mexico City demands me to eat quality food not any kind of food just because it's a  Mexican restaurant . Rivas has good taste but you're never going to taste IN AMERICA as same as Mexico because everything starts how the animal is grown and prep. But that's all my comment on Rivas I really recommended"}
{"text":"ordered the chicken burrito and had them add lettuce an sourcream. tasted great and fresh."}
{"text":"I ordered through uber eats and was pretty happy with my food. I got french fries and a wet steak burrito. The burrito was large and enough for 1.5 meals for me. There was a ton of steak in it and I liked the pico and lettuce that was included on the side. Pretty much what I expect from a quick service mexican place."}
{"text":"Good place to eat tacos !! Good size too, for 2 bucks.. it's worth it.. I've only tasted they're tacos .. they have cheap tacos and the tortillas are good .."}
{"text":"After several pick up orders, they are a pretty good place to get Mexican food when the craving hits. Definitely better Robertos, but not as good as Serranos or tacos shops on Trop.  The tacos are a good size, not the smaller sized street tacos. Carne asada steak and chicken are good options. Not a fan of the pastor here.  One dish that I love here that I have not seen anywhere else is the chicken fries! Get that!  It's right by Green Valley High School across from Walgreens. You can't miss it with all the bright window lights.   *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 71/100"}
{"text":"Thinking about coming here for Taco Tuesday? Check out my review first. First off, the restaurant was very clean and there was no problem communicating with the counter lady. I asked about \"taco Tuesday\" and she told me their hard tacos were $1 off. So I was like alright cool but what about the soft tacos, nope... regular price for those. However, it was my first time so I ended up ordering some to try.  I ordered two carne asada of the soft and four chicken of the hard. My meal came to about $20 because I also ordered a horchata. No surprise there, mixer made of course. The reason for my eating was because for the $4 I paid for the soft tacos, I didn't feel that the value of the tacos were worth it. Decent meat that I'm sure I could've made better at home.  The hard chicken tacos weren't going to impress either as they actually reminded me of the tacos you get from Jack n the box for a dollar. Overall, it wasn't enough to get me to come back or decide on a new taco spot. Maybe some other time I'll try the El pastor and possibly other meat tacos but I won't get my hopes up.  Let me know if you have a different experience, it's always worth finding out for yourself what you'll like or not.  Remember, \"you never know until you try\""}
{"text":"Went there tonight to get a taco,etc. Never had been here before but had good reviews. I must say that the Asada taco I had and my wife had a shrimp taco were delicious. Our problem was the temperature of the restaurant. The outside temp tonight was 47 and it was maybe 60 degrees inside. When at the counter we asked the young lady if they had the heat on. She replied that they turned the AC off. I said they should turn the heat on and she chuckled. When our food was ready at the counter I again asked her about the heat. I asked her who the manager was and she pointed the man in the back who was cooking. I said tell him that the customers were freezing and to turn the heat on. She went back and spoke to him but I am sure he didn't turn the heat on. The thermostat was out in the dining area. Even the girl at the counter was cold as she had her arms crossed in front of her and almost looked like she was shivering. Whoever is the owner of Rivas Grill needs to speak to this guy and quit acting like he was paying the heating bill. Maybe it was warm in the kitchen but not in the dining room. Honestly we would have ordered more food but we couldn't wait to escape to the warmth of the car."}
{"text":"Love coming here when I can't decide what to eat! I love the chicken burrito special and the steak fries!"}
{"text":"The service was great I was greet with a smile and hello. I order steak nachos, cheese quesadilla, and a wet chicken  chimichanga. The steak nachos were great goodbye Robertos hello Rivas. My daughter actually ate a good portion of her cheese quesadilla because it was full of cheese.  The only reason I didn't gave a 5 rating was the chimichanga was okay. Overall great customer service, large portions, and gets the Mexican fix filled."}
{"text":"Ordered a ham breakfast burrito.. At first the burrito looked large but after the first bite it was full of soggy fries. The burrito was full of soggy fries, very little egg (breakfast burrito) and decent portion of ham. Who puts fries in a breakfast burrito?! I get seasoned potatoes, but French fries?!   Definetly disappointing."}
{"text":"Just another mexican place in a Sea filled with just ok mexican restaurants. The medudo is just ok. I have had menudo out of  the can and it tastes just as good. The pozole was a big dissapoitment. Don't go out of your way to eat here"}
{"text":"Ordered steak fries today and it was delicious. Fresh, non-greasy goodness. Yes, the fries were not greasy! Yay! Their spicy sauce is bomb! Def must have. Only thing is it's $8.99 for a small portion"}
{"text":"Rivas mexican grill sin duda alguna lo recomiendo variedad de comida mexicana. Es una delicia . No hay algo q este en el menú que no me guste . Por la atención calidad de personal. El restaurant super limpio un ambiente agradable ."}
{"text":"Don't eat here!!!! Woke up this morning feeling extremely sick, I know what a case of bad food poison feels like.  Was craving Mexican food last nite, and now I regret it!"}
{"text":"Best mexican food! meats are grilled and taste like you were in mexico eating tacos and burritos"}
{"text":"Friendly service, great food, good prices: I have a new lunchtime favorite!  Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This review is only for the carne asada fries which might have been the best I have had since being in Nevada. I ordered delivery through yelp and it came super quick. I have been back a few times before making this review and this is probably my favorite thing on the menu."}
{"text":"Ordered the #2 combo to go and it was very good! The chicken was very flavorful and they threw a lot in the container that I ended up with three meals from it! I will return soon because I want to try the steak next!"}
{"text":"Being new to the area, my wife and I saw this restaurant in the local shopping mall. Wanted a quick bite as well as a place to sit down to discuss our activities for the day, this location accomplished both.  I ordered 2 chicken tacos alacarte and my wife ordered carnitas tacos. Both of us agreed the flavor was pretty good, we didn't add any sauces or anything but all in all, pretty good. I think next time I will ask for extra cheese. They do have a bar to enhance you food (veggies and sauces)  The seating is not too bad, they had the Golden Knights game playing (GO KNIGHTS GO), and allowed us to enjoy our food, discuss what errands we had left and watch the game for a bit. However be advised the sit down seating inside is limited, however there are tables outside and on a nice day, would be nice to sit at.   All in all, a decent place to get some decent food and chill for a minute."}
{"text":"Ugh, okay...so after a few more times over and over my official rating is 3.5 stars. Customer service is always friendly and great, but I'm realizing while they are another option 4 stars was putting the pedestal and I have to apologize because while I still think their food as good...it is no longer that 4 star spark. It regressed back to the original rating and experience. However, I'd still recommend them as another option if you're sick of Robertos."}
{"text":"They opened up few months ago decided to try them, there cashier is very friendly and polite. Been there 3 times now 1st time burrito steak delicious. 2 nd time chicken burrito yummy oh there huge 3rd time for breakfast Huevos rancheros  disappointed not much on plate and over salted and refries were not fresh. Serve no coffee for breakfast or ice tea for lunch??  Pricing is great $"}
{"text":"It's my first time to try this place. So far so good. I ordered the shrimp taco and the pastor taco, with a cup of pineapple juice as my drink. They're pretty delicious. I will surely come back again to try their other food in the menu."}
{"text":"I was craving some Mexican food for 'Cinco De' Mayo.' I was searching on Yelp, I seen this place on there called  'Rivas Mexican Grill.' This is my first time ever hearing about this place and I never ever had Mexican food delivered, I normally always ate at a 'Mexican Restaurant.' I read good reviews about 'Rivas Mexican Grill,' so I decided to give them a try. I had my food delivered to my Apartment.   I order the California Steak burrito, that had Steak, Potatoes, and cheese, I had them add beans to it to, salsa and guacamole. I also order the Steak Nachos, and the Chicken hard shell taco. I truly enjoyed it, I also like that they're affordable. The burrito filled me up, they're very big. The chicken taco was good to.   My only issue is the Nachos. I think it was good, also love the steak meat they use, but I feel that having them delivered, the chips got soft so easily. I think if I was eating at the restaurant, the nachos will be better, cause they're served right at that moment and probably on a plate, where the chips is spread out. The nachos probably wouldn't gotten soft cause they're served right away at that moment. I think having them delivered though, they're going to get soft, and also from having all the cheese, steak, beans and stuff on them, stuff in a to-go box, they will of course get soft. Other than that, I will for sure order from them again. I also will love to try other things on their menu to. I truly do recommend this place !!!"}
{"text":"I work close by this restaurant so I come here for lunch maybe once a month. The food might not be the healthiest but everything taste good. I like getting a wet burrito or carne asada nachos. They have a station for salsa and spicy pickles carrots. Portions are generous and prices are fair. I never left here without feeling completely full. Better than Roberto's in my opinion."}
{"text":"We have gone to Rivas a couple times.  The first time was via a yelp review and the second time I found a restaurant.com coupon.  Food here is fresh made with large portions.  Both the food and service were great. Place is clean and small salsa bar is fresh looking and clean. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"GOOD...that's all you need to know. :D  Oh, also, space is limited inside but they do have to-gos and outdoor seating but it's crowded!"}
{"text":"I usually get a 2 chicken burrito special about once or twice a week. I've been coming here for 3 years that the employees already know what I'll order. Great service, speedy prep time and freshly cooked. Doesn't leave a stomachache like Robertos or chipotle does. Their extended closing time until 11pm is greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"While driving I noticed the same thing that you always see when you want Mexican food Roberto's taco shop, but right below the sign I see an unfamiliar face... \"Rivas Mexican grill\". I thought to myself, let's see what they got. I go in and the first thing I noticed was their very vibrant feel, very upbeat colors and beautiful menu. I was greeted with a \"hello, I will be right with you\". 30 seconds later he is taking my order. I order the burrito made with their \"pastor\" meat. I go and retrieve the salsas and noticed that there salsa is very thick unlike the one at Roberto's. Next thing I know, they tell my food is done! I sit and take a bite, and I wasn't very satisfied with the taste. I decided to add their red salsa and wow, one of the most well made salsas I have had in a Mexican restaurant. Many places can't seem to grasp the taste, but at Rivas you can taste every ingredient, with a slight spicy taste at the end. I finish my burrito and I'm off. The place has a very upbeat feel to it with vibrant colors! A very polite staff and, the restaurant, is not grimy or dirty at all. The burrito was nothing special, but I will certainly come back to try something different."}
{"text":"The wet chicken burrito was huge!!! The rice was flavorful and the cheese moist. The sauce on the burrito was a tad bland but still good.  The delivery was really fast considering rush hour. We will order again soon"}
{"text":"Always fresh, friendly, delicious. We go there at least once a week. Nachos are excellent!!! So is everything else."}
{"text":"Love the food here great flavor and service with a smile.. Will never eat at Robertos again."}
{"text":"awesome food.  cool little place.  only problem: waited a while for a simple to-go order."}
{"text":"Eh I heard so many good things about this place and it was just ok. I got Al Pastor fries and they were gross. But my husbands Carne Asada fries were ok."}
{"text":"This restaurant is getting a 1 star from me mainly because of their customer service. I ordered a steak wet burrito with beans and guac, no cheese. After getting home I see that there is maybe a spoonful beans and all steak nothing else. The steak was very bland and full of cartridge and fat. I couldn't eat it as plain as that so I tooo it back and I explained to the lady in the front. She laughed in my face and pitched back her head saying oh my god this meat is top quality it is very very good and then turned around and spoke in Spanish to her cook not realizing I am white person that is fluent in Spanish. She ended up saying this kid thinks are meat is bad and wants it replaced are you kidding me. Give or take on a a few words. In the end she replaced it for free when I offered multiple times to pay for the new meal."}
{"text":"Fresh, flavorful and good portions. You can tell food is made to order with quality ingredients. Not a fancy place but food is A+!"}
