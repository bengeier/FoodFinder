{"text":"I've been here so many times!! I love their selection of salad!! Friendly staff!! i love the patio during summer times!!"}
{"text":"what a nice place. Really like the halibut and chips. Best fish ever. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Used to be good to go to.  Recently they have renovated.  Now they have little booths which few people can fit into.  My 6'4\" son couldn't get in and I'm shorter but couldn't get in either.  The next people who came were a party of 3 and only one got in and the other two could not, so they had to move.  Stupid waste of money.  Food is the same, no problem with it."}
{"text":"I've never had a less than terrific meal and service here. Add the availability of mushy peas and unlimited tartar sauce with the fish, and I am one cheerful buckaroo. If they ever start serving rum, I'll never leave."}
