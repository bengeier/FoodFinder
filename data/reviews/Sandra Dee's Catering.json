{"text":"SO GOOD!  The food here is truly exceptional and authentic!  They were good enough to help out at our charity event (on short notice).  They were on site and set up on time and everyone LOVED THE AMAZING FOOD!  Sandra was so personable and sweet.  Thank you for everything, I would recommend you to anyone!"}
{"text":"I got the Sandra Dee Triple! Fried oysters shrimp and catfish! They give you some awesome dipping sauces and French fries and I ate waaaay too much! But by golly was it ever good! Thank you Sandra! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with Louisiana's food when I first visited there earlier this year.  Sandra Dee transports you straight back to the Bayou with her cajun food.  Spicy, Fried, and Delicious.  Plus, her big southern personality makes you feel right at home, like you're part of the family.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Our company had their food truck at our site today. I chose the pork po boy as i had never had one before. As i waited i noticed everyones orders flying out except mine. I assumed that maybe it took longer and the two people who ordered after me got the same thing and were also waiting. What frustrated me was that those two had there numbers called before mine when i had the same thing. I voiced my concern to the girl and she just laughed an said its coming. What horrible service. I will not be trying their food again. Sandwich was average."}
{"text":"Great food and Southern charm - can't get any better than that.  Catfish done perfectly.  Cannot say good enough things about the fried fare; shrimp, catfish, chicken baskets all delicious and a must try especially for first timers.  Creole sauce and hot sauce are amazing accompaniments.    Some of the best gumbo I've had in Phoenix and also a must try if it's on the menu.  Poboys are awesome - go for the catfish or shrimp.  If Sandra has crawfish available, give it a try.  Absolutely delicious and fun to eat!"}
{"text":"For me, Sandra Dees exemplifies the true essence of a small business / food truck. She is not trying to be anyone she is not, her food is genuine, and she takes pride in making sure her product is top notch.  Had the shrimp which was seasoned to perfection and cooked perfectly. It came with a little ramekin of some delicious sauce I would drink on its own.  Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Another food truck Friday at the capitol. The choices did not disappoint, food offerings from all over the world. The one that sounded most appetizing to me was the creole shrimp poboy from Sandra Dee's. I placed my order and the gal at the window asked if I would like a side of fries?  Hmmmmm, \"are they homemade fries?\" I asked. She responded with a confident yes. Ehhhhhhh!  Wrong again. Those fries are definitely from a bag stored in a freezer. The fries were a disappointment, come to think of it, so was the service. I waited way too long for my food. My coworkers had their food and were finished eating by the time mine was ready. Could my initial disappointment be reversed by an amazing poboy sandwich???  Why yes, yes it could and it was. This was by far the best shrimp poboy I have ever had!  The shrimp was perfect, not too fishy tasting and not rubbery. The creole sauce was such a perfectly spicy compliment to the dill pickle tucked in amongst this bread wrapped fabulousness. For the sandwich alone I would give this truck 5 stars. Taking into account the wait and not homemade fries they claimed to serve I have to meet somewhere closer to the middle.  If you are lucky enough to have an hour lunch and don't mind the wait.....go for it. Otherwise you're best off with another vendor who can get lunch served up quickly."}
{"text":"This food truck/trailer is a must visit. Creole Cooking that is Oh So Good! The gumbo was phenomenal as is the shrimp, and I am not a shrimp fan in the least. To say I'd order a Shrimp Basket for myself should speak volumes about the skill with which Sandra crafts her offerings.  From Shreveport, Louisiana, Sandra bring a wealth of Creole knowledge and you'll be glad you sought out her truck with every tasty, savory bite! Sandra, herself, is such a nice, personal, ebullient lady, serving up heaping helpings of friendly chitchat along with her catfish, shrimp and porkchop po' boys done the right way.  Be sure to follow her on Twitter (@SandraDeesFoods) to find out where she's parking the trailer and get yourself some Good Eats!"}
{"text":"A welcome new addition to the ASU Food Truck Block Party.  Id heard about Sandra Dees southern fare for a while now. My hubby ordered their southern fried chicken (comes w/ fries) and I had the creole hot wings. They were out of water they day we went, so we drank the koolaid (ha ha).  My wings were....average. I didnt taste any creole seasoning, just hot buffalo sauce. My hubby, however, loved his fried chicken. The one taste he allowed me to have was very good. The chicken was moist and the breading had just that right crunchyness. Great seasoning too.  While I was disappointed in my meal, it wont stop me from going back to try something different.  See you next week Sandra Dees!"}
{"text":"They came by my work today and i had to try the Cajun food from a Louisianan. I had the seafood basket with shrimp and catfish. Loved it. The shrimp were delicately battered and fried to perfection. I'll look them up in the future. A little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"UM Yum!!!!   Sandra Dee's was parked outside of my office today. The advertisment sent by our complex via email was very unassuming. It simply stated Sandra Dee's Catering with a picture of a truck and a short list of menu items. Benigets, coffee, biscuits and gravey Chicken and waffles. I thought hmmm not everyone can do biscuits and gravy justice maybe I'll check it out.   Then I looked them up on Yelp and found that Sandra Dee is from Louisianna! Jack pot! It's against the law to be from Louisianna and not know how to cook B N G! Well at least it should be. So now fueled with this new information I am on a mission to hit up this food truck!  Wow the flavor! A few bites of biscuit were dry however the generous serving of very flavorful gravy moistened it right up! I will definately keep my eye out for more goodies from Miss Sandra Dee! I think the Dee is for Deelish!  Might have to go back for a Beniget!"}
{"text":"Seriously!?!?  How in the HEII am I the first person to write a review for Sandra Dee's Catering!?!?  Crazy!  But woohoo ~ First Review!!  :)  I had made an executive/birthday decision last night for dinner.  It was either drive down to Fudds in Tempe and use a birthday coupon or do something else.  I decided to check out the Phoenix Street Coalition's facebook page and see if there were any food trucks gathering.  Lo and behold - Sandra Dee's was going to be right around the corner from us in Old Town!  I inform J...let's skip getting stuck in traffic and check this place out.  I'm certainly glad we did!!  Sandra D is very friendly and when I asked if I should get the Shrimp or Catfish Po boy, she suggested the shrimp and trying a basket instead.  So I could try the shrimp on their own.  I decided to go with her suggestion.    OMFG - The shrimp was AWESOME!!!  Lightly coated.  Not undercooked.  But not rubbery.  Awesome seasoning.  The sauce provided to dip, tasty too, but not needed.  The shrimp stood on their own.  :)  Seriously, these shrimp were so good that J enjoyed a few pieces too, and he's not a big fan of crustaceans!    As we were getting ready to leave, Sandra comes out of the trailer and I inform her that my dinner was amazing!  J, SD, and I get to talking and she mentions her gumbo.  We end up getting a sample of it to try.  That too was flipping amazing!    J's take on the Gumbo - \"I'd describe the gumbo as sensational.  Well seasoned with a broth that puts others to shame.  The andouille was spectacular.  Firm and savory.  The shrimp perfectly cooked and every bite balanced\"  We look forward to visiting Sandra Dee's Catering truck again!  :)"}
{"text":"We had po' boys at lunch today and they were well seasoned and tasted fresh. My oysters were crispy! We will definitely be returning. Thank you, for the friendly service!"}
{"text":"Fantastic shrimp po-boy!  The ingredients were really fresh, the bread was soft and tasty, the shrimp crispy and the sauce was delicious.  It will be hard getting anything else.  I'll have to though since their other dishes look great as well!"}
{"text":"Be sure to shop their locations! Prices can vary *significantly* depending on where they park"}
