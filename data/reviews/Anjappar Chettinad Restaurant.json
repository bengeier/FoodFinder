{"text":"The butter chicken was good. Also had side dish of cauliflower and garlic naan, both were also good. Satisfies a butter chicken craving."}
{"text":"Excellent South Indian restaurant in Toronto. Clean and calm ambience. Good customer service.

Must try restaurant in Toronto (mainly the non-veg dishes)"}
{"text":"This place serves the best chicken biryani I have ever had.. hands down! When I was pregnant with my daughter, I craved their biryani that I ended up having it several times (yes im guilty of overloading on carbs!) love love love! I would suggest that the restaurant needs an upgrade tho... it doesn't look very professional inside and when I came here while I was pregnant, the chairs were not very comfortable at all but the biryani is ON POINT!"}
{"text":"Used to like this place earlier. One day i wanted to try their masala dosa, i requested the server for masala on the side of the dosa to avoid it getting soggy, she simply denied by saying our chef wont do it. All the restaurants do that. Some even adopted this method of serving to avoid lousy dosa. I am a hotelier myself and our chef and I do whatever is possible for a guests request. My request was very simple and they cannot accomodate it. I am not going back to this restaurant after this incident."}
{"text":"One of the best place to have south Indian food in the GTA. The place is so calm and quiet and you can enjoy your stay there for a while.The service was ok.

The main attraction of the this place is the varieties of South Indian food . My favorites were malabari chicken curry and their meen kuzhambu and I loved their porrota.I am happy to suggest this place to my friends."}
{"text":"I went here late at night about 9:00 P.M. because another restaurant in the area that I wanted to go to was closed.

We ordered Tomato Onion Uttapum and Paper Masala Dosa.

Review of Tomato Onion Uttapum: 
Although we ordered Tomato Onion, they gave us Tomato Onion Chilli Uttapum, and depending on your heat tolerance for spices, green chilli's are pretty spicy, but we were able to pick them off and it was yummy. Uttapum is a flatbread made out of Rice and Lentils that are ground up and fermented overnight, it is a thicker bread, about 1/8th of an inch, and about a 10\" round, it is pan fried and the tomatoes and onions were inside it, and on top.

Review of Paper Masala Dosa.
The paper masala dosa was awesome, the best part was that the masala was served in a different bowl, most restaurants put the masala inside the dosa which can make it a little soggy where the masala was sitting by the time it gets to you.

Paper Dosa, is a very thin and crispy crepe made out of rice and lentil flour that has been fermented overnight. Masala is a stuffing made out of potatoes, onions and a few different indian spices.

Review of Mango Lassi:
The Mango lassi, seemed fresh and was quite flavourful, it was just the right consistency and sweetness for my taste.

This is a south indian restaurant, so if you want to try south indian food, skip to the last pages of the menu because the first few are north indian foods, ask your server about the difference between north and south indian food.

Overall the food was great, the place was clean.

I would go back :)"}
{"text":"They have recently updated their decor  (not that they needed it but it is a nice touch)  got the thali which is a great meal that consists of 1 meat/fish curry and SEVERAL little vegetable dishes. Great way to sample different dishes. Being a south Indian I love their south Indian cuisine. Their butter chicken is amazing as well"}
{"text":"These guys increased the price for mutton kothu..i asked them has the quantity or quality  increased?? they said no, so i asked then why did you increase the price, with tax it comes up to   $13:50 something for just one kothu.  They said they added some more items to the menu so to offset the loss they increased the price of kothu rotti...what an explanation...not going to this greedy people anymore.  The Kerala restuarant at Kennedy and Lawrence is little better, but still pricier."}
{"text":"One of the best authentic tamilnadu food.
Best attukal soup.. Along with spicy chukka biriyani all finished with authentic South Indian coffee."}
{"text":"Chicken Kothu Parotta was tasty, filling, and spicy. The Payasam  was delicious. I have a weakness for creamy desserts. The place was clean and service was very good.  A simple meal is about $10-11 and a lassi, falooda, or other desert is about $4-5."}
{"text":"This is my place for comfort food.. My favorite is the Ceylon egg parotha with veg gravy. Ever since I have had it, I hav stopped trying other things on their menu, I just don't seem to get enough of it. I have tried their buffet on weekdays that have good variety and everything tasted good. This place deserves at least 4 stars. The people who work there are friendly, polite and I have always been impressed by their service."}
{"text":"Non veg thali was gud but my friends dont lk d dosa.

After we ate lunch, we went to sleep after reaching  hom. I m sure dey put som ingredient which made u sleepy.  I wl ask food department to check the kitchen hygiene n ingredients dey use to cook food."}
{"text":"Some of the best dosas in the city. Warning their spicy is legit spicy not just kinda spicy."}
{"text":"This restaurant is just ok. The food tastes good, but the portions are small. first impressions were good because of the atmosphere, but the waiter kept asking us to order more things throughout service and it was slow. Also, it's too expensive for what you get. Also, rice is 5$."}
{"text":"Excellent buffet at a reasonable price. Those warm gulab jamuns are to die for. Yummyyyy..... I also loved the deep fried chicken chettinad, fried cauliflower, chicken curry and dosas. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Chettinad cuisine is spicy and flavourful.  My must tries - even for meat eaters would be the Cauliflower 65. Over the years, I've been here many times.  It's deep fried, spicy, cauliflower goodness. So amazing, whenever we go we end up getting two plates. In terms of the main dishes - the dosa is okay, the crab curry is great, the briyani is so good, gravy, raita (yogurt), and a hard boiled egg is provided. The egg parotta/roti is also good! The curries overall - from the vegetarian and meat dishes I've sampled have been good. Their \"North Indian\" dishes are decent enough.  Mango shake the last time I tried as pretty good. 

Cons: In terms of service , it's not superb. that being said, I've had some good wait staff. and  sometimes you get someone who forgets to refill water but it's okay. It's not hard to flag down attention or walk up to the counter (do whatever you got to do).

Portion sizes are adequate for family style sharing of dishes. 

They also have a side room to host small parties and etc."}
{"text":"We had a small family reunion during March break at this restaurant. There were 20 people in our group and we came here for South Indian dishes. We were a little sure about this place. However, from the moment we walked in, we felt like home. All the staffs were nice and the service was exceptional. We had ordered all sorts of dishes (dosa, chicken curry, butter chicken, mutton curries, devils, Biryani (shrimp, chicken and mutton), crab curry and fish curry). Manager came out few times and check on us to make sure all the request dishes came out on time and meets our expectation. In fact, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Ive passed this place hundreds of times and stepped in for the first time the other day. I was very pleased to discover a great indian buffet in my area. They had a variety of curries and we got both naan and roti to go with that. Dosa was an option but we passed up on that. The standouts were the chicken masala, and paneer. The staff were a very friendly, although there was one instance where we asked for naan and did not recieve it for 20 min. The venue itself was clean and nice, with a sink on sight for washing up after eating. It was quite spicy, so be forewarned if youre not great with spice. Overall I definetely will return,  and would reccomend to anyone looking for indian food in the scarborough area"}
{"text":"We ordered about $80 worth of food.  When we asked for a condiment  (pickle), the waiter refused to bring it because it is not a part of the ordered food.  We had to call the manager and agree to pay $1 extra to get the condiment.  Real  Cheapos. The restaurant has terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Went there today with my two friends.
One of my friends was starving for an hour waiting for her order, reminded the staff twice. An hour later they bring it after the gravy she ordered is cold. Canceled the order. Refused to pay for the item returned. 

This will be our last time there..... Very disrespectful!
Staff needs training!!!

Similar incident every time we go there....."}
{"text":"Very good, slightly pricey. I got an assortment of things a platter over one big meal as I wanted to branch out in my food selection but also some favorites.
Not many people in the restaurant over dinner or much work put into the overall atmosphere. I took the food home with me although if I wasn't alone I would have ate there too.
My food was fresh and tasty. Not the best but not bad. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"The food is not very expensive here. 

We have been a number of times, usually we get the Onion Uttapam, and the Onion Dosa. The good comes in pretty good portions, and the chutneys are usually made pretty well. For the most part the service is pretty good, though a few times we have been there, the service was not good. On those occasions I left some fairly pointed comments on the card, and after that we did not have those issues again. 

The atmosphere her is often very noisy, this is definitely a family oriented restaurant, so if you are expecting a quite dining experience beware of what time you are going. 

Otherwise, good food, reasonable prices, mostly good service."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this Indian restaurant.  Have been going there for the past 5 years and have never had a bad meal.  

We always order the thali because we can never decide what to order and the thali has a little bit of everything.  All their dishes tastes like they just cooked it fresh from the stove.  

You cannot go wrong with any dishes.  Their Tandoori chicken is THE best in Toronto.  And their Masala Dosa has the thinnest and crispiest dosa....it's light.....yummmy....

Just writing this review is making me hungry and it's past midnight so I cannot go right now.  

We always order a lot so that we can take the rest home.  The food tastes even better the next day. 

All their soups are SUPER HOT & SPICY but it's worth the after burn.  I think they simmer their soups all day long to get that cooked through taste.  

Everything on their menu is great....I don't have any favourites because they are all so good."}
{"text":"Love that their food is spicy and the selection is vast. Don't like that sometimes it's a bit too spicy and I can handle my spice! Also there is often way too much gravy in the curry dishes with 1 or 2 pieces of meat. That's not acceptable. Their food is great though and because of how close they are to my home, I will go back to get my East Indian food fix."}
{"text":"Being a fan of South Indian vegetarian cuisine went to dine there but it was a total disappointment."}
{"text":"Mysore masala dosa - delicious, highly recommend. 
Kingfish fry - amazing (2pieces), highly recommend.
Anjappar chicken - good, spicy
Vegetable kurma - good! Not my favorite type of dish in general, though. 

South Indian and Sri Lankan food, good sit down in the area. Staff are nice. Place was pretty busy on a Thursday night, looked like a lot of regulars so you know it's good!"}
{"text":"Terrible value for money. We ordered Malabar chicken curry that had only a few bits of chicken in it, all sauce. the Chili Gobi was overcooked and mushy, not pleasant at all. We ordered home delivery through Door Dash, the driver was great but the restaurant took forever to prepare the order. We ended up waiting about 1 1/2 hours to get our order. I never take the time to call a restaurant to complain or to write a bad review, but this experience was SO bad it motivated me to share."}
{"text":"The dhosa has been closest to what I have seen in India. Now we have been coming here almost every night. 
Can get very crowded at times but other than that its all good.

My favourites:
Mutton chukkha Biriyani 
Cheese Masala Dhosa
Falooda"}
{"text":"I went here with family to celebrate my mother's birthday.  As the only non-vegetarian in the group, I think I was the only one truly satisfied with my meal.  I had their signature mutton dish, which was incredibly tender and flavorful and almost worth the trip for it alone.  However the vegetarians in my midst were grumbling about their bland sambols, and borderline spoiled daal.  They were asking why we didn't go to Karaikudi instead.  Nonetheless, the overall experience was satisfactory and I would go there just for the mutton dish.  It was sublime."}
{"text":"Really lovely south indian dosa restaurant. I've only been here once but was really impressed. Service was nice (but could have been faster) and the decor was lovely as well. Okay, now the food lol. 

I had a paper dosa thali with a huge paper dosa (I guess they are supposed to be huge anyways) with a yummy potato masala curry and sambar and chutneys. Sounds really typical, but the quality and taste was on point! Better than a few other places I have tried actually. My favourite was the coconut chutney because the tomato chutney was too spicy for me. And the potato curry was really simple and delicious. My friend had a upama (hope I am spelling that right) with the sambar and curries however that dosa could have been bigger I guess. It tasted good though, but should have been bigger. Okay so, after the main course, we had pineapple kesari, which was very very yummy. I like simple dishes with top notch quality. Really wins my heart. And then I had a sweet paan with a cherry as well. The paan was loaded with flavour and the leaf looked green and fresh. Wrapped in a perfect pyramid shape, it was a fun treat. Overall I had a happy sunday lunch :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the vegetarian Biryani and my friend had chicken Biryani. The vegetarian Biryani was salty and boring. In addition it had over cooked vegetables, which looked like they came from the frozen aisle from the grocery store. Not worth the price. The chicken Biryani is with flavorless chicken that is also dry."}
{"text":"If you are looking for your dose of South Indian non vegetarian food, this is a great choice (although my favourite in this category is Karaikuddi in Scarborough). They have a lot of options and are quick in their service. The challenge that they have is the restaurant is always crowded and sometimes miss (or delay) the order which wasn't in their original list. However, the Manager or Owner  is pretty proactive in responding to the requests. Also, the restaurant doesn't understand the concept of \"mild\" spicy. It was still spicy for me. LOL.The restaurant has a dedicated parking and makes it easy if you are traveling with family. I never fell lin love with the place but won't mind visiting it again."}
{"text":"This is a great place for dosa, and the \"meals\" are also quite fantastic with a generous amount of food. I found the mutton curry excellent and well cooked along with all the other vegetables around. Will definitely return to try the other options available."}
{"text":"The signs were there but we ignored them. Bad move. Looking for somewhere new to try, this was our fourth stop for lunch.

Our first stop was a Jamiacan restaurant that we heard about because of their barrel-cooked jerk chicken. They had no jerk. Of any kind. Not today. How can a Jamaican restaurant not have jerk???

The second stop was a Guyanese restaurant that didn't open until 2pm. What? If you're not open for lunch, why bother opening at 2pm? The third stop, an Indian restaurant across the street wasn't open today. Hmmm...

With Indian food on our minds now, our handy Yelp app brought us to Anjappar Chettinad, a South Indian restaurant with a lunch buffet. We were hungry so this was it!

We were seated in a large spacious dining area and the buffet was set up in another room where the dining tables weren't being used. The buffet selection was very limited, with two types of chicken and a fish dish as the main proteins. There was plain rice, biryani rice, a few vegetarian dishes that I wasn't familiar with, fresh fruits, ice cream, and a couple of Indian desserts. No butter chicken, channa masala, or mutton?

The biryani rice, mushrooms, and tandoori chicken were good. The rest was just okay, passable, not memorable. I would have preferred at least one other meat dish and maybe a couple more veggie (chick peas) dishes.

The service was below par. There was hardly any dialog with our server and we had to ask for everything - napkins, beverages, bill, etc. I'm used to Indian buffets that offer a lot more selection for less money. At $14.99, this was not a good value, and not an experience worth repeating.

PS - Although a bit frustrating, the earlier experience at the first three stops did not affect the review of this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered from here today, because I heard some good reviews - I experienced differently, however. 

-I ordered the cauliflower (which was good, no complaints there... but not 'fantastic')
-The veg biryani they were out of, so I opted for egg... which was overcooked and had a gross green ring on the inside of the egg.
-The onion dosa was soggy and boring... no real flavour to it. I took two bites of the pastry and threw it out.
-Butter naan was burnt
-Gulab Jamun w. ice cream was the only thing I enjoyed... 

Would not suggest this to anyone. Been to Vindaloo on Kingston Rd. WAYYY BETTER!!

Also, this place had horrible/rude service and was out of two of the things I originally ordered."}
{"text":"First time at Anjappar Chettinad in Scarborough. Horrible experience in terms of service. Brought an out-of-town guest to the restaurant with family. Waitresses were highly un accommodating and not so helpful. Squeezed 6 of us into a table suitable for only 4. We asked for another table to connect on, they refused. Said it would get busy (restaurant was next to empty). Ridiculous trying to eat comfortably and balance 4-5 other plates on the table. Waitress was rude, very rushed and evidently in her own world. Had to ask her FOUR times before she finally refilled our water. Terrible, terrible place. 

Food was o.k, the only reason I've given it 2 stars but the overall experience is not worth it. Truthfully, you're better of heading to Karaikudi Chettinad on Kennedy Rd. if you want South Indian food."}
{"text":"Food - very good. Variety of flavours, good quality meat and veggie dishes.

Service - not good. Often careless. The waitress asked us to pass her plates/cups that she could have easily gone around a chair to get herself. Really? Please do not interrupt us to ask us to help you clear the table. That is your job. Also, wait staff do not come around to refill water etc. 

Bathrooms - This is supposed to be a family restaurant with a banquet hall facility. However there is no baby changing facility in the restaurant. Normally this would not bother me but in a banquet hall type of place, this is an absolute necessity.

Overall, food is good but there's a lot of room for improvement."}
{"text":"Excellent Chettinad food.  Portion sizes are small.  Mutton pepper fry really good.  My friends had their dosas and loved them"}
{"text":"I been to a great variety of south indian restaurant. This for me personally for just simply okay and it was not super impressive. It had a nice dining space, okay service and the food was decent. For me personally, I would go only once just to try it out. Not sure about the non-veg but the vegetarian options were good."}
{"text":"Great place for authentic South Indian food. The dosa,idli and the Thali are amazing and very reasonably priced. They also have a lot of options available for the kids. Please try the South Indian style coffee too."}
{"text":"As you can, see I am waiting ever so patiently before I destroyed this dosa. So happy I married an Indian man, my culinary horizons have just expanded! :) Nothing is bad on this menu and we have tried many, many things.

The used to have an appetizer, shredded pepper chicken, that was to die for."}
{"text":"This is a great chettinnad restaurant. We love the one in Mississauga and tried this one as it happens to be close to our place. The Crab roast is unbelievable. Very spicy and flavourful. The Kerala Parotha is very good too. Crisp and fluffy. Other nice dishes are the chicken chettinnad roast, the chicken varuval, the mutton pepper fry and the fish 65....the prawn Malabar curry is good too. The biryani is also delectable...

Please stick to the Chettinnad fare here. Don't come here for Dosa. This place is more than that...

Honest, tasty and unpretentious..."}
{"text":"For such a pretty decor I wish the food and service would live up to the beauty of this restaurant. 

Today was my 4th and final visit at this disastrous, chaotic cheap sidewalk vendor disguised as a restaurant!

Time to rant:
- They put out tiny portions at the buffet table on a Friday lunch hour
- Then you wait 20 mins for them to bring out a handful of naan, paratha and worlds thinnest and sometimes oiliest dosa 
- The ENTIRE restaurant rushes the buffet to get some, so u wait in line 10mins like a dog waiting for table scraps - by then the food u plated is COLD!! FML
- Menu items not consistent - getting butter chicken here is like playing Russian Roulette
- The buffet is set up to serve from both sides, yet they only want you to serve from the front - so then you need to LEAN over the GD food to reach dishes in the back - and dropping hair and lint in the front dishes 
- The servers are poorly trained and just walk around like chickens with their heads cut off as a result 
- You ask for things they never bring, and there is poor communication skills (I blame mgt not the staff)


Positives: (yes, there are a few)
- Great dessert selection!! A variety of fresh cut fruit, gulabjamun, ice cream. 
- Canned pop, so it isn't flat fountain drink
- Clean tables
- Ample parking
- Generally good selection of clearly labeled buffet items (but I repeat small portions that run out quickly)
OMG standing and waiting like a begging dog...I can't even!!!

Oh yeah - posssssative...... Chairs r comfy 
Ummmm there's a bathroom.  And....omfg stop being stingy with the NAAN!!!!!!! Arghhhhhh 

Ok I'm done now. 
Thank you. 
Never again!!



, and every time I've come here I wait 20 mins to get naan or dosa at the buffet. By the time they bring a tiny ration people"}
{"text":"Ordered butter chicken, a side dish with cauliflower and garlic naan. Place is not busy with plenty of parking. Their mango lassi is also good. I would come back here on a regular basis. Service is good but I cant comment on service during busy hours."}
{"text":"Great food! We have tried a variety of dishes from the menu and all were very delicious! I do feel that the portions are a bit small for your buck. I would prefer if they gave more food. However, everything is so good, I would definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Love that its in my neighbourhood......good food, friendly service and clean!!! I've been going here since it opened and I'm always satisfied although its not the least expensive place...."}
