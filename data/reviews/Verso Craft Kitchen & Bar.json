{"text":"This place is an absolute joke!!! Spins Bowling alley needs to evict them and get a better restsurant in their place. No one was manning the bar (which is also run by Verso) inside of the bowling alley, so my friends and I went into the main restaurant/bar to buy beer. There were only two customers in the entire restaurant/bar, yet the bartender was overwhelmed and very rude to us. She barked at us rudely for our IDs instead of asking politely, and gave us attitude the entire time she was serving us. She spilled my pitcher of beer on herself and gave me an attitude, sarcastically remarking \"You're very welcome\" as she rudely pushed it across the bar top, before I even had a chance to say \"Thank You.\" If I hadn't already written a tip on my recpit, I wouldn't have tipped her a single cent, because she was a complete jerk. I'm not impressed in the slightest, and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"We had been to Verso's old location, and we liked it. This was a different experience. Not terrible, not great. We went as a family of five on a Wednesday night. There was one largish party there so we wound up being seated at a high top with an extra stool on the end. Kind of an inauspicious start; the distribution of table types is poor. Had we a family member with mobility issues or one more person, we would have had to wait with one party in the place. Service was quick and friendly; drinks and a solid appetizer portion of pretty good spinach artichoke dip with housemade chips came. The menu isn't broad, appetizers, pasta selections, sandwiches, pizza and burgers. Our order included a turkey club, an open-faced steak sandwich, a calzone, a house salad and one kid ate appetizer garlic knots for dinner. The wait was just long enough that the food came about five minutes after we started wondering where the food was. It wasn't bad, it wasn't great. I don't like saucing decent steak because it tastes good already. This steak needed sauce. The turkey club was enthusiastically endorsed, and the calzone was huge.  Our server asked five times if everything was all right. That always makes me wonder what is happening in the kitchen, or if they get a lot of send backs. Nothing we ordered needed sent back but her persistence was...interesting.  Total bill with tip was $70 including tip, $14 per person, half a calzone for lunch today. Not terrrible pricewise, and just a little lacking on execution. We'll probably be back."}
{"text":"We had a party of 15+ for my son's birthday on a weeknight. The restaurant was moderately busy, and I felt that we got good service. The menu is a little strange to me: being attached to a bowling alley, I would've thought they would have chicken fingers, chips and salsa, more finger food items (which honestly I just wanted to order for my kids!) - however they were able to make us an order of chips and guac even though it wasn't on the menu, which I appreciated. Everybody said the burgers were very good, and so was the steak sandwich. I had chicken marsala which I thought was average. The side of pasta marinara was good. My husband had chicken parmesan and thought his portion was on the small side (but he's a big eater, so for me it would've been fine.) There was no bread before the meal that I can remember - for an Italian place, I would've thought that would be standard? Regardless, I thought it was good and a good price. Plus, there's the new arcade attached and the bowling alley, so for my son to have a fun night out for his birthday it was perfect. I'd recommend!"}
{"text":"First time to this location. I really liked the previous spot for the atmosphere, a little quieter.  They did bring much of the interior from their other spot. Still has a nice selection of high tops or booths. The menu is mostly the same with a few changes.  Pepperoni rolls for a starter were great. Good selection of wines and beers. The homemade citrus basil dressing is great on salad.  we enjoyed the creole chicken pasta, and a burger. Service was very good, Amber did a great job."}
{"text":"I waited two hours for a meal that I never received. It's very obvious they just opened in this location. However, we watched a table of 8 get seated after us, eat and pack to-go boxes before the problem was ever recognized."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for an amazing scratch meal with taste and flavor like no other, than head on over to Verso Craft Kitchen & Bar at Spins Bowl (formerly Cloverleaf Lanes). My favorite is the 1/2# Asian Burger drizzled with Sweet Chili Mayo, Scallions, Slaw, Hoisin Ketchup and a generous portion of hand cut fries. Wash it back with a cold, Pint Microbrew and enjoy the company of good friends and Great Rock and Roll!  Erin the Bartender and all the Girls will take great care of you!"}
{"text":"Verso has been a staple for me and my kiddos for years. Many a pizza was had at the Parma location with them while I was in school. I didn't know they were heading to a new location and thought they had just closed. I was elated to find out they'd just moved on up. We went last night and everything was just wonderful. They have some great new menu items and our server was just a peach! We all left with big smiles on our faces and will be back many times to come."}
