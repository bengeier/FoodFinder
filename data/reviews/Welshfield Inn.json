{"text":"My wife and I frequently have lunch here after spending time at the Burton Antique Show. We have always had a good meal and friendly, professional service. Saturday, 09/27/14, was no exception. I had the 'Shrimp and (cheesy) Grits'...wha?? Yes, sounds \"unusual\" but it was very flavorful. Would have liked more shrimp but actually the grits and other ingredients made up for it. What a unique combination of flavors. Really different. My wife had the 'Slowly Braised Pot Roast.' Absolutely perfectly cooked tender beef, pan gravy and mashed potatoes. I don't think my grandmother could have made it better and she was a GREAT cook. Our server was busy but he always kept our glasses full and checked with us just often enough to meet our needs. We ate inside and have also dined on the beautiful patio in the past. In six or seven times dining here we have always had a very pleasant experience. Sorry to read that some customers did not.

{"text":"Nice place.  Casual enough to take the family, excellent food, good service and the best cinnamon buns i have had. 
Get their advice before choosing your entre. 
Met the owner a couple of weeks ago and he said the cinnamon buns are even better now."}
{"text":"Welshfield Inn is a cute historic place with pretty yummy food!  My chicken salad sandwich was good, but tasted like there was just a little bit too much mayonnaise in it for for me.  My Mom enjoyed her turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes and my two sisters enjoyed their big, green leafy salads, but said the chicken tasted like it was made from frozen - not real tender.  We all thought the iced tea was wonderful and loved the cinnamon buns and rolls.  We did enjoy our time there and liked the atmosphere!  We do plan to return!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service. I had Welshfield rarebit -- melted cheese sauce with lobster on sourdough bread. Asparagus side. Heavenly. Others at our table had Stroganoff, schnitzel, crispy chicken sandwich. Everyone loved their entree. Nice basket of rolls too. Will go again and again. 
We went there again for my birthday dinner and found it just as good as the first time. I had two glasses of Benziger Cabernet and it was superb. Filet for an entree, also excellent, and Gary had pork schnitzel, also very good. Only complaint is stale rolls and odd to get cinnamon rolls for dinner. Upping stars to five. What a find!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, perfectly seasoned comfort food and drinks, friendly service, great atmosphere..can't ask for better! We will be back!"}
{"text":"We were there last winter and it just keep getting better ! !  We and the other couple  both got the 2 for $40 Thursday special.  Each of us got a different meal and all were excellent.  My Braised Pork Shanks were  a winner.  Service was great.  

I'll be back there in a week for a Birthday celebration and I can't wait for another great meal !"}
{"text":"After coming from Great Lake cheese factory we were looking for somewhere to eat. With little to no options we stumbled into this restaurant. I had the onion soup, Caesar salad and sandwich of the day (some sort of French roast). Needless to say we were very pleased. The service was great and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been here on several occasions and have found exceptional service and great food at each visit. The restaurant is so cozy, with fireplaces and beautiful woodwork. The dining areas are sectioned off like rooms in an old house so your dining experience is much more intimate.

We had our wedding reception at the Welshfield Inn Banquet Center. Kathy was extremely helpful through the whole process.

The reception was amazing. The staff was uber helpful. They actually seemed to be enjoying themselves. (Whether or not they were faking it is irrelevant!!!) We got a lot of compliments on the food from our guests. I was expecting the food to be less tasty than the food you are served when you are in the restaurant since they were cooking for a large group, but that was not the case. It was awesome! They even made us a few dishes not on their menu!!!

I really felt as if I just said \"This is what I want: blah, blah, blah\" and when I showed up, everything was exactly the way I pictured it. Some of the wedding party and guests mentioned some really helpful things the staff did for them. 

The prices here are very reasonable for the service, atmosphere and quality you get. It was much less expensive than other places we looked at in Ohio. I don't even want to guess how much a wedding like this would cost where I live.

The Welshfield Inn and the awesome staff on hand helped make this the best day of our lives."}
{"text":"Very Disappointed.  I've been dining at Welshfield for nearly ten years now, recently it has changed ownership.  The change in management has not been positive, I used to love dining there.  This evening I was seated at a table that wasn't clean and had dried food particles that stuck to it; the waiter brought a basket of rolls to the table.  The rolls  were wrapped in a cloth napkin that had food stains not consistent with rolls. The rolls had clearly been at another table, or at least the napkin had. When I confronted the waiter he didn't seem to think there is a problem with that.  Between the dirty table and the rolls that had clearly been on someone else's table, we decided to leave. The manager was friendly but I don't really think she cared, I paid for my drink and left. I probably won't go back, which is disappointing because it's been a meeting spot for many years. Hopefully, the house salad and the French onion soup are still good."}
{"text":"We have returned again and again to the Welshfield Inn, because it's different, classy, accessible, warm, historic, and always has great food.

Last night, we took advantage of the specials - prime rib (huge, meaty-not-fatty portion) and tenderloin and scampi combo.  Both would cost double at Fleming's.  The basket of homemade rolls, including cinnamon buns, is a nice touch.  The Welshfield Inn's chopped salad is always a good idea - not too dressed and full of fresh ingredients.

In the past, our daughter loved the chicken pot pie.  She pronounced it better than she'd had anywhere.

Our waitress cared if everything tasted OK - and, of course, it did!  Four dollar Long Island Iced Teas were the cherry on top.  Can't beat the Welshfield Inn!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food, I ordered the chicken parmesan and it looked very promising. However, after the first few bites I realized the chicken was very bland and burnt. I have to say, McDonalds has more flavor than my dish."}
{"text":"I will make this clambake a regular fall event. Rustic clambake meets traditional restaurant service.  The decor is festive. Set under a tent but heated AND a large screen tv with the football game on which my husband appreciated. Your choice of lobster, steak or chicken. I had the chicken- large portion and moist. My friends had the steak and lobster and they enjoyed their choices.  Best clam chowder I have ever had at a clambake. I don't eat clams or mussels but my husband said they were great. All you can eat soup and mussels the first hour. Plenty of sides. Make reservations early. Last year I called too late and they were booked all weekends. Finally, I didn't expect dessert but they served a delicious pumpkin roll. Service"}
{"text":"RUDE!!! 
We TRIED to come to the Welshfield Inn for their Monday $5 burgers, but no luck.  We came and asked to be seated and the hostess said they were closed. I had never been to the Welshfield Inn, so my friend asked if we could just walk around so she could show me the place. As we were walking around we noticed several people in the dining room and on the patio enjoying their meals. When we came back to the hostess we asked what time they closed, she said 9:00, I checked my phone and it was 9:01...and this was AFTER we took the time to walk around the restaurant.  We asked again if we could be seated and she said NO. 

Seriously?!?! We arrived before 9 and they would not even consider seating us. Very Rude and NOT accommodating in the least!  RUDE RUDE RUDE!!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  Great atmosphere.  Fantastic waitresses.  The food is always delicious.  The tilipia with lobster cream sauce and asparagus is one of the best dinners, it has me craving to have it again and again."}
{"text":"We love this place! It's a great place for a date night! We are frequent flyers especially on Thursday nights. They offer a 2 for $40 which includes an appetizer, 2 entrées and a bottle of wine. The salmon and risotto entrée and is amazing! We love the calamari and brushetta appetizers and the french onion and mushroom bisque soups!
The staff is super friendly every time we are there. We love the live music in the dining room. The decor is rustic and beautiful. We can't wait to try out the patio in the summer! This place is a must if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"This venerable old place is in Burton, Ohio amidst Amish country .... building itself is very cool -- historical old farmhouse ...... hands down -- BEST CINNAMON ROLLS you'll ever have ! Its a fun little destination if you're looking for a diversion from chain restaurants ."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in a converted century home setting I've only stopped in for lunch never dinner. I've have always been greeted at the door and the friendly staff always provided exceptional service. The place is all white cloth covered tables and is very nostalgic. They always have great lunch specials and the chef does an outstanding job with his food presentations. The portions and prices are a little high for the area but they deliver on quality. 

Lunch time the place is always filled with business people and it can accommodate small party for club meetings and there is always  good amount of elderly people dressed nice and enjoying the
atmosphere around a cozy fire or out on the patio weather permitting. This was always my go to spot for business lunches in the area and everyone always enjoyed the time spent here. There is a small bar area that is great for afternoon cocktails plenty of parking and easy access off of Route 422. I don't think you will ever be disappointed making this choice I would highly recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"Good food and great service.  Love the atmosphere.  Would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for 20 years. The food is fabulous. We love the 2 for $40 on Thursday's. My husband loves everything on the menu but his personal favorite is the beef liver. It is a rare menu find and he raves about it every time. My go to is the salmon, it has a creamy lobster sauce that I adore.  Even when we have ventured on to other menu items they never disappoint. 

We have always had good service but this week we had a young lady named Brittany. She was sweet, very attentive and knowledgeable about a few new items on the menu. She really was top notch and probably the best service we've had to date. 

Thanks Brittany for a lovely evening!"}
{"text":"Ate there with friends, great food.  I like that the tables are not on top of each other.  We had three kids with us and I don't think the people next to us heard much.  The only negative is that it is in the middle of Egypt."}
{"text":"Great food and great experience. Thursday's it's 2 for $40, good deal to take advantage of."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar with a friend. Made it in time for early bird special. We had to ask to receive the  specials menu, but it was worth it. The salmon was tasty and moist. The asparagus done perfectly. Rice very unimaginative. Got out the door with a beer and tip for under $20.  Originally went for the $5 burger which is a popular weekly special. The patio is awesome. The bartender, Tara is knowledgeable about wines, personable and provided great service."}
{"text":"This place is best for lunch. Dinner is far overpriced for  the caliber of comfort food offered. They got rid of the chicken pot pie..which was, I must say, quite impressive, and substituted this odd tasting short rib pot pie. In this, the scant pieces of rib are ruined by the red sauce which DOES NOT WORK  and should be reserved for a stuffed cabbage/pepper based dish if you were to filch from gramma's cookbook. A minimalist schnitzel rounded out our dinner which my wife \"wafted\" all night long.
Nice place. Good service. Friendly people. Again, lunch good. Dinner....meh."}
{"text":"Started with the zucchini haystack, great then had the Pork Shank and ended with the delicious gingerbread desert.  Definetly would come back here."}
{"text":"The place is clean with a nice atmosphere.  Service is attentive and friendly.  Food, however, is not very good.  I had prime rib, that was dry and served almost cold; the vegetables and potatoes were a little warmer.  The quality of meals at WI used to be very good but has been getting worse in the past few years."}
{"text":"Made our first stop there today for burgers.
They were very well done though we requested medium rare.
It turned out very dry.

Looked over the menu to see the prices are much higher than before.
don't think I'd give them another go if they can't make a simple burger right."}
{"text":"Drove in from Akron for some kayaking on the Cuyahoga and lucked into this oasis for lunch. Food was fantastic. Outdoor setting was literally like a country club... Beautifully manicured. Service was also great. Highly recommended..."}
{"text":"Why we went again was not my choice don't ask me but my wife wanted to go to welshfield Inn so we did. And for the  i hope last time I ordered your special pork loin it was supposed to come with stuffing and gravy when I arrived there was no stuffing no gravy and it was so dry it was like hard . They used to have nice rolls.today rhey were stale and served cold..stay away is places gone down the hill.you hate to complain because it is embarrasing."}
{"text":"I'm a true fan, even though it is in the middle of nowhere.  Classic comfort food from an Inn that has been around forever. The last ownership change was very good and the patio is actually exceptional.  Good bar, excellent service ... the Chicken Pot Pie is to die for.  Worth a trip out 422 to Welshfield."}
{"text":"Had lunch today with a friend. Really enjoyed this restaurant. It was established in 1842. It was a nice day today they did serve on the back deck. We decided to eat in one of the dining rooms. 

I started with a small chopped salad with their house oregano vinaigrette dressing it was excellent. They also gave us a bread basket. 

For my meal I had their liver with onions and bacon served with mashed potatoes and green beans. If you love liver be sure to try theirs. 

A friend had a crock of French onion soup that look excellent. He also had their Braised beef & wild mushroom stroganoff. It also looked excellent. 

They have fresh perch and walleye which should be a great lunch choice.j

Friendly staff. Really clean restrooms. A big parking lot."}
{"text":"We have dined at the Welshfield Inn many times. Though I consider it a bit overpriced, we've always found the service & food to be very good until today.

Perhaps management had not planned for the Easter Sunday crowd but, considering reservations were required, I find that implausible. We were promptly seated & our server was attentive throughout our visit but the food & price points left much to be desired.

Our meals took about 35 minutes to be served. Since our server was reliably visiting our table to refill our beverages, I lay blame on the kitchen. I ordered brunch which consisted of 3 eggs, 2 sausage links, home fries, 1 slice of toast, & a small fruit cup. Both the homefries & sausage were served lukewarm. My wife ordered scallops & mashed potatoes. She received 3 small scallops for $38 which, in my opinion, should be considered robbery.

Is the Welshfield Inn becoming complacent as one of the area's few fine dining establishments? Were they overwhelmed by the holiday? Is it a different management team on Sunday afternoons than it is during our past visits on Friday & Saturday evenings? I wish I knew. But this experience has me hesitant to return.

If you have read my review to this point, please help keep me motivated by casting your vote. Thank you in advance."}
{"text":"Comfort food in an atmosphere that is casual, relaxed and friendly to couples or families.  The dishes are reminiscent of the food your Grandma made when you were a kid. Pot Roast, Chicken Pot Pie, Mac n Cheese. They also have a full bar and have a decent wine list! The service is spot on and the staff dresses in white shirts, and dress slacks. Just like in the good old days. This place has been around forever ( for a REASON) if you are in the area, and want a really great meal, in a really sweet atmosphere, I highly recommend The Welshfield Tavern."}
{"text":"We have been here many times and usually love it. The chicken chopped salad has always been my favorite. However, we went Tuesday night (not a very busy night) and were very disappointed! My husband ordered the chicken pot pie and said it was not any better than the $1.99 Swansons you can get in the grocery store. I had the chicken chopped salad and the chicken had a distinctive fish taste. I had everyone else at the table take a bite and everyone agreed. I told our waitress, she took it back and they offered my a free dessert, which I accepted because I was HUNGRY. They did not take the salad off the bill. I'm not sure what happened that night, hopefully it was just an off night. We take out of town business associates there for lunch or dinner quite often and we are re-thinking that right now."}
{"text":"Loved it here and will go back. The atmosphere, staff and food were great. Everyone in our group enjoyed their dinners and had a wonderful time."}
{"text":"Have been here a \"million times\". Absolutely superb. Food is terrific and wait staff attentive. Lobster Mac 'n Cheese is to kill for. Wine list also great. Outdoor patio a neat setting."}
{"text":"Absolutely Perfect!! 

We went to the Welshfield Inn for dinner to celebrate my birthday. Neither of us had been to the restaurant before but both can't wait to go again. 

This historic location still showcases its vintage feel but with great newer updates. The host was very nice and told us the best seat they had available was next to the fireplace and asked if we would like that. He then sat us and alerted our server that we had been seated. 

Our server was great! She was knowledgable of the menu and offered great suggestions. She really did an exceptional job from start to finish. 

We got the calamari as an appetizer and it was by far the best I've ever had. It was cooked perfectly and was just delicious. The dinner rolls they bring out are also fantastic. Then for dinner I had the country fried steak that just like the calamari was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. My boyfriend got the scallops and  lobster, sweet corn bacon & asparagus risotto. He is a very picky eater and rarely likes to try new things but he also enjoyed his dinner. He thought it was cooked perfectly and tasted great. 

The Welshfield Inn made my birthday amazing!!

The food, sevice, and atmosphere all receive 5 stars and we highly suggest this restaurant to any and everyone!"}
{"text":"We just were at the Welshfield Inn this past weekend for a rehearsal dinner and the food was fabulous. The service was great and the atmosphere is very charming. This is pretty much in the middle of nowhere Ohio. As you look around outside you will see modern cars as well as horse and buggy's since you are in the largest Amish community in the world (fun fact for everyone. I am sure you were all dying to know that). 

The menu had a list of 5 meals all with sides to choose from. I choose the Chicken Picatta with  asparagus and rice It was all cooked in a nice white wine sauce that was to die for. My husband got the pasta dish they offer and he said it was great as well just a very big portion. I had a few bites and it was quite good. The sauce was not overpowering but they include tons of fresh vegetables with the pasta. 

Overall it was a good dinner experience at a place I would have probably never visited on my own."}
{"text":"Really really good food.  Enjoyed the schnitzel and a nice glass of wine.  Wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch with my 85-year old grandmother and her sister, as it's one of their favorites. I was expecting a much better experience, as they rave about it. I wasn't too impressed. 

The exterior is gorgeous. I see why people would use it as a backdrop for wedding or event pictures. The back patio looked really lovely, too. Inside was pretty drab and stuffy. It is an old building, and it shows (and smells). It needs to be aired out and deep cleaned.

Food got mixed reviews from my group. My great-aunt thought the liver was to die for. So if you're into liver, this place is your jam. The chicken Parmesan sandwich was pretty good. Very flavorful. The special, a tuna melt, was just totally mediocre. I was a little irritated because I asked to sub the bread for a variety featured in several of their other menu options. They didn't have it, and instead of letting me know so I could make another choice, they subbed my bread out for me. Not worth sending back the sandwich, but it was unsatisfying. The (I'm guessing house-made) kettle chips were disgusting. They were all burnt and completely inedible. My daughter literally spit them out in disgust. Terribly disappointing, as who doesn't love a good kettle chip!? 

Service was decent. Our server was pleasant."}
{"text":"I finally got here after wanting to do so for several years but it just never seemed to happen.  It is delightful - beautiful building and really, really nice staff.  There were four of us and we were seated promptly and politely.  Couldn't believe it when I saw liver on the menu which I know isn't what many people like but I love it.  Cooked to absolute perfection.  The rest of our party were as happy with the choice as me.  My only complaint and it is minor is that I ordered iced tea and was  never asked  if I would like a refill while those who had coffee were refilled several times."}
{"text":"Scary place to eat if you are a vegetarian. Sent my chopped salad back 3 times to take off meat an egg. It was embarrassing because it was an event that was planned for me there. Well I am going to try it one more time then leave it behind. What a shame"}
{"text":"My first time at my late father's favorite bar and restaurant. Craig the bartender hugged me remembering my dad. 
The food was insanely good - flatbread with goat cheese and raspberry crisp? Awesome. 
Be careful with the cinnamon rolls they bring in the bread basket at the beginning of the meal. There's a serious risk of eating so many you won't have room for much else. 
Great place."}
{"text":"Affiliated with Gameskeeper's Taverne

Different menu.  Very good.  Worth the trip out there."}
{"text":"On a sunny afternoon, I enjoyed an idyllic lunch with a good friend on the patio.
We had a lovely time and a very delicious meal. My lobster rarebit was just delicately sauced. The toast points it was served on we're perfectly done, nice and crisp but tender.  I had enough chunky lobster meat to equal a tail and claws of a regular size lobster! And also done just right!
My friend had a open faced turkey on REAL mashed yukons of which I sneaked a bite!
This is my second visit and I can't wait to come again.
Bar service was also above expectations.
Oh yes and be prepared to have a second meal if you order the apple caramel pie. It came with ice cream and was huge."}
{"text":"Beautiful outdoor seating, deeeeeelish cinnamon rolls, excellent meal and very attentive and friendly staff. One of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Amazing find! The most lovely staff, creative menu and country sophisticated ambiance! Perfect locale for a cozy date night! Start with a cocktail in the bar and then head into one of 3 dining rooms for a lovely dining experience. A huge thumbs up for Cleveland's east side dining crowd!"}
{"text":"Went to Welshfieldl Inn after a funeral ceremony on a Saturday afternoon
 Very nice patio, surrounded by flowers
Good service and great food at reasonable price
My wife tried Lobster rarebit , very good
I had loin schnitzel also very good
Waitress gave us sample of wine special to taste before we chose wine
Will go back"}
{"text":"We went for brunch (5 ladies) and all of us enjoyed the food, the atmosphere and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place the past few years. I have never had a bad meal and I absolutely love the short ribs and salmon.  Ok, the Mack and cheese is pretty delicious to.  Good specials so watch for them."}
{"text":"Upscale comfort food in a bucolic setting, we thoroughly enjoyed lunch here today. I had the cream of mushroom soup and the schnitzel lunch entree. My wife enjoyed the schnitzel sandwich sandwich with fresh chips, my sister had the short rib pot pie.

We also had two chopped salads that were refreshing. 

The waitress brought rolls and cinnamon roll muffins - all were yeasty fresh and delicious. 

The only thing that was not good - the potatoes in the pot pie were not completely cooked. 

The dining room windows looked out on the garden, a great view which made for a relaxing lunch. 

The waitress was attentive without being overly so. The room was a bit chilly."}
{"text":"I always love this place.  The menu is great and the atmosphere is cozy and the exterior looks like something you would find in the south.  I would recommend coming in the warmer months and sitting on the back patio.  It is very pretty.  
We actually take our kids here too for a nice meal."}
{"text":"Well, I'm pretty spoiled living in a big foodie city. When I come back to Troy (Welshfield?) to visit my folks, though, we're often stumped without options. Combine my vegetarian diet along with my sister-in-law being a celiac and having a gluten-free diet, and its pretty hard to find good restaurants to eat at in the area without venturing off.

This Father's day, we ended up coming to Welshfield Inn for brunch after I called to ask about their gluten free options. They seemed confident that they could accommodate us, made a reservation, and squeezed us in. They were also fine when I had to move the reservation back 45 minutes, and then we still showed up late, anyways.

The interior of the restaurant has changed since I last remember it. Gone is the ugly floral wallpaper and *most* of the frilly and frumpy tchotchkes and creepy doll collection I remember as a teenager. Now, it is nicely painted dark, natural colors and has a few choice antiques on the walls. It feels like an appropriate level of \"old country\" without being so in-your-face that you feel almost insulted by it.

Service was excellent. Our server was friendly, attentive, understood our diet requirements, and accommodated changing a few menu items to make them vegetarian or gluten-free.

The food was actually quite good. I had Eggs Benedict without the ham, and they were happy to put spinach on instead. The sauce was great, the eggs were just right, and the potatoes were nicely crispy without being greasy or burnt at all. It was an excellent rendition of a classic (well, modified classic). 

The gluten free breakfast (scrambled eggs, potatoes, fruit, if I recall) didn't upset my sister-in-law at all, and she is extremely sensitive to the slightest contamination. It passed the GF test - she texted me later saying she was so happy to not even suffer from a stomach ache after the brunch. So, I guess they did a good job not cross-contaminating the food or letting any crumbs fall in. Thanks!

As excellent as all of the dishes were, there wasn't really any creativity or flare to them. Nothing quite \"gourmet\" about it. They do standard dishes and they do them well with good service in a nice, old historic building. I'm not sure anything creative would go over well in this town given the typical clientele that come here, but, you know, that's what it takes to get the 5th star from me :-)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Friday night fish fry. Large lightly beer battered cod. Succulent. With fries and a dab of cole slaw. Would not substitute the fries, and we would have liked more slaw. But all was very good for $12.95. All you can eat. Service was good, too. Looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"What a wonderful family dinner. Felt like we were at our own dinning room table. Except we just got to sit and be served. Rebecca was own young pretty server she made our time so enjoyable. We will be there next a Thanksgiving and sooner."}
{"text":"This restaurant has come under new ownership, which apparently has made the Inn suffer from poor management and organizational issues. While I wish I could rate this restaurant entirely based on its menu, unfortunately, the disorganization behind what the management did to my family yesterday is inexcusable and, frankly, important to bring up to would-be patrons of this establishment. Weeks ago, my family carefully made a reservation to eat here on Easter, an understandably very busy time. My mother even requested that they please reserve the table by the window, so my elderly grandmother could look out at the garden view she so enjoys. When my family showed up with my 90-something grandmother at the time of their reservation, they were informed that the reservation had been \"lost\" and there was nothing that the management could do to help my family. Imagine trying to find somewhere else to eat on such short notice on Sunday Easter! The least the management could have done was offered a gift certificate or something to make it up to my Grandma, who, by the way, came all the way out there in her wheelchair. Eventually, the only offering they made was to stick them in the \"party room,\" which is the annex building next door where cheaper and far less palatable food was being served buffet-style and people were forced to sit at long, picnic-style tables. My grandmother, in a wheelchair, mind you. She isn't even strong enough to lift herself from her chair any more!

I will happily update and change this review when my family has been appropriately compensated for the poor way this whole incident was handled. Any gesture at all would go a long way toward showing some modicum of respect toward my poor Grandma who used to be their most devoted patron when it was under the former ownership (she ate dinner there nearly every day when my grandfather was alive)!"}
