{"text":"Burger was tasteless!  Fries greasy, and soggy!! They are getting 2 stars because they were very nice!"}
{"text":"On Canada Day, I took my wife, my son, and his girlfriend to this restaurant. They have daily specials, and due to some confusion on the waitstaffs part, we were told th daily special was buy 1 pound Wings, and get a second pound free. Howevet, this was actually Mondays special, while Canada Day this year was on a Tuesday. Once we pointed this out, they were kind enough to let us have that deal, even though it was now Tuesday. The server was very attentive to us, and helped us with whatever we needed without complaint or attitude (unfortunately these days, that can't be said about all servers...). So kudos to them for the great customer service. 

My son and his girlfriend shared the Chicken Wings, while my wife and I shared the Brisket and Ribs Combo. There was plenty of food to go around, so sharing is definitely an option unless you are really hungry. When we were done, there were still one or two rib bones left we couldn't finish. 

The food was cooked well, and tasted great. The Ribs and Brisket were nicely smoked with a flavourful dry rub, and the Chicken Wings were cooked just right with a nice sauce. We were offered a choice of two sauces (served on the side) for our Ribs and Brisket. I enjoyed the Hickory BBQ sauce, but it was a little too spicy for my wife. The other sauce was a sweet sauce, but it tasted more like a sweet and sour plum sauce than a sweet BBQ sauce. I only wish they had a couple of more milder BBQ sauce options for those that can't handle things too spicy. The baked beans were good, but it would be nice if the portion that came with the Combo was a little larger (it was in a small paper portion cup). The only other issue I had with the food was the cole slaw. I couldn't quite put my finger on the flavour, but it had a very strong taste of herbs (maybe oregano? It reminded me of a Greek spice  mix...) Which no one at our table really liked.

Overall, the food tasted great - the few negatives I mentioned are more a matter of personal preference than any lack on the part of the food. They are definitely not enough to keep me away, and shouldn't keep you away either. If you enjoy BBQ, give Rick's a try, but bring some cash if you think you might want to tip the waitstaff. I had no cash on me, and their debit/credit system has no option for adding a tip. I felt bad, but we were in a hurry, and I didn't want to have to drive around looking for a bank machine..."}
{"text":"We ordered a full rack of pork ribs and they were fabulously meaty, great tasting and perfectly smoked!  They didn't need sauce, but we gave the two sauces that came with the ribs a taste and both were well balanced - spicy, sweet for the first one, and tangy, peppery for the second."}
{"text":"I'd like a 4.5 star rating... Gravy on the fries was a little too salty, but otherwise a perfect lunch!  Great burger with home made patty, condiments on them tasted fresh and cool.  Generous fries portion, a large is a good share for 2.  This is now my favourite go to burger place in Newmarket hands down."}
{"text":"My daughter and I met at Rick's for lunch. We shared the ribs and pulled pork combo plus a Ceasars salad. 

The ribs  were excellent; dry rubbed with a hot and a sweet.saice on the side.  The pulled pork was also very good. The salad had real bacon pieces. 

Rick is an interesting guy.  Like many of us, he had a long career somewhere in the corporate world.  \"I spent as much time on airplanes as that George Clooney character.\"  He's now 'enjoying' his afterlife doing BBQ. 

I plan to go back soon to try the brisket."}
{"text":"Ribs were perfection!  Friendly, charming staff.  Great new gem.   You gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"BEST BURGER I have had in a really long time. I can't believe I didn't find this place sooner. Have now been a customer for just over a year and I'm loving absolutely everything on the menu. There is one specific special in mind but I can't tell you what it is because it is so good. You will just have to try them all!
LOVE IT"}
{"text":"Ordered the 8oz burger with cheese and a side of fries. Fries were burnt but cold. The burger itself was okay the bun and meat was a little dry but overall an ok edible burger . 
Also ordered the mini smoked platter, 3 ribs , brisket and pulled pork. Never came in with high expectations but found it hard to enjoy the meat without the two sauces they gave us.

Overall an okay place but nothing I will be craving to come back for."}
{"text":"Was here having dinner on a Thursday night, pulled into the packing lot at around 6:15pm, noticed it was empty in the restaurant, was debating whether we should go by our senses or reviews, again got conned into trying a restaurant by raving reviews.  One other table walked in while we were there but felt very rushed by the sever, she tried to take our orders while we were still burying our heads in the menu, told her we need another min, she came back literally a min later and asked whether we were ready or if we need another min while I was still trying to figure out what to order, not sure what the rush was. Food was bland, no smoke flavor, not properly reheat, ribs were dry and hardly any meat, pulled pork was dry and not well seasoned, wings are only deep fried, no grilled. We were there around an hour, not a single soul come in, even though they clam that the last table that we were going to sit was \"reserved\". Overall not impress by the food or service."}
{"text":"Rick's Cookhouse is awesome. The pulled pork is amazing. The staff is always very friendly! I believe it was the owner who served me the first day I walked in, and he was very welcoming, and gave me a little extra sauce for my sandwich, even though the pork was already perfect. Instead, I dipped my fries in it! Which are always awesome as well. Keep up the good work! Happy to see a Davis Drive business receiving so many positive reviews"}
{"text":"We visited this cute location last week for the first time ever. We were craving simple BBQ style, and Rick's cookhouse Texas style seemed to be the perfect fit. The location is hidden in a mini plaza, you might miss it at first. Inside is clean and smells delicious with all the food being cooked. There was only one other customer sitting down eating so it wasn't crowded. Service was quick and they even served us at the table, which is very appreciated since the competitors rely on ordering at the counter and waiting to carry your own food tray. I got the chicken pulled on a bun, with a size of small fries and bae got pulled pork with a side of small fries. The sides are extra, but there are also combo options. Warning, the sandwiches are filling! They are huge portions, I was forcing the rest of my sandwich so it wouldn't go to waste. He did forget the coleslaw on the side for the pulled pork, but we were never fans of coleslaw anyways so it wasn't too much of a big deal. The pulled chicken would have gotten full stars if it had a delicious sauce to go with, it was pretty dry, but no doubt still delicious.
No doubt this will be our go to place for large pulled sandwiches until we find a better one."}
{"text":"Great Texas BBQ. Large portions. Happy service even when you arrive right at closing time"}
{"text":"Went for dinner. Quality and portions very good. Pulled pork and chicken tender and delicious even without sauce. \"Little Texan Burger\" tasty and great value. Service was great even though intermittent power issues, staff did best to serve!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out. It was a good find! The server was really nice and attentive and also recommended a few things on the menu. The food was great. The flavours and portions were good. Prices were decent as well. We got the pulled pork sandwich and the Texan burger. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite. Ribs were super good, pull pork sandwich great, roast beef sandwich was terrible- so dry and way over cooked. 
Fries good. We felt so rushed.  Waitress was cleaning up our food before we finished eating, and sprayed our table with a water bottle with some bleach in it to clean the table while we were still sitting there. $50 for 3 of us was a bit much for a quick meal of 1/2 rack or ribs and 2 sandwiches"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of big bone bbq but this is my other favourite bbq place when I crave meat. The ribs and sauce included are way different than anything I have ever tried but that is a good thing. Only minor complaint is that the wings were a little chewy and rubbery but the sauce on them was great. Will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"I have never been more disappointed :( in a nutshell: overpriced and bland taste. Good customer service, though! 

After hearing about Rick's Cookhouse from my Newmarket friends and seeing these fantastic reviews I had such high hopes for this place. When we went in on a Saturday afternoon there were two small kids enjoying a meal and it smelled like a backyard BBQ (pretty empty and not very impressed at first glance). I took a look at the menu and was surprised at how high the prices were. \"Well, if the reviews are as good as they say then it must be worth the price!\" Whenever I visit a new place I always go for a basic menu item. If the basics are down pat, then it's worth exploring the other menu items. I liked how the gentleman attending the counter was very prompt and helped us right at our table. He was also super polite so that's a plus! 

I ordered the 8oz. original hamburger (lettuce,
Tomato, onion, pickle, ketchup) and a poutine. I read the gravy is salty (it really is) so I asked for no salt on my fries. I can't imagine how the fries would've tasted if it had salt on it because they were still pretty salty. The beef patty itself was super dry and tasted like it had no flavouring even though it said they use their own speciality spices. The bread they used was soft and actually the most flavourful part of the burger.

Overall, I doubt I would come back to try this place again."}
{"text":"I don't get over to Rick's Cookhouse as much as I would like but we have had dinner (take-out) on a few occasions and really liked it. I've had their ribs and wings combo but I especially love their burgers and fries and onion rings. Everything is made fresh. I love their fresh-cut fries. I also really like their BBQ ribs sauce.
The service is especially good. You'll often see the owners there, working the grill and filling orders. One night, after I had worked late, I had arrived at the Newmarket GO station at 7:45 p.m. and called them to ask if it was too late to order some take-out (they closed at 8 p.m. that evening). The person who answered the phone said it was not too late and happily took my order. Thank goodness! I mean, when you're craving a burger, nothing else will do! Will try the brisket next time I visit. I will try to get back there tonight, in fact, since it's been a long time!"}
{"text":"Me and my kids went in, and as they are picky eaters we just had the 8oz burgers.

very nice, not greasy and drippy. A nice homemade piece of burger on a soft bun.
The patty was about the size of a CD and as thick as a mans thumb across the nail.

Service was great, David took the time to sit and speak with us about the place and how he got there.

I was curious about the pulled pork so on the way out I asked for a small sample.

It was not all plastered in sweet sugary sauce like some others are.
It had a very nice flavour and from what David told me, they put just a hint of their homemade sauce in the cook.

After I ate it,, I felt a very mild tingling sensation on the tip of my tongue........beautiful!!
I think there were some crushed chilies in there somewhere, but nothing to put you off.

We are looking at going back again hopefully on Jun 4th, if things work out properly.



Definite recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Ok so one thing is definately clear about this place... they are true to their name. If you go to some of the other places around here they basically DROWN their meats in whatever they claim to be the \"best bbq sauce ever\", where at Rick's he just lets the smoker do the talking for him and lets you have your sauces on the side, this is a much better way to enjoy bbq, and the pulled pork is amazzzzzinnnng... buy it by itself and just add buns to the order... bring it home, and make yourself a pulled pork sandwich.... mmmm... I just slather mayo on the bun , put the pork in there and go to town.... thats how we do!"}
{"text":"Newmarket gets another rib joint! Rick's is located near Southlake Hospital on Davis Drive, geographically almost in the center of every other rib place in town.

Stopping in for a quick lunch, I ordered the Smoked Taster Mini Combo, a great way to sample the important parts of the menu for $15.  Looking at the burgers coming out for other diners, I thought they looked really normal-until I found out they were sliders.  Then I saw a burger-she's a hefty unit!

My \"basket o' meat\" arrived, brisket, pulled pork and 3 ribs. This was an ideal meal for me, since I don't have much interest in carbs. I have been known to eat plate after plate of ribs with no sides at all.

I ordered the sweet sauce not knowing it was almost a peach syrup.  It was great, but I was looking to reference a normal hickory sauce so I ordered up a bit.  Smoky, rich with a nice heat, it really blended with the dry rub.

Overall, the rub is a close race with MoJo, but the sauce wins me over, only because I like hickory sauce over Carolina sauce.  Rick's is in a tie for top rib joint with MoJo, and Big Bone very close behind.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pulled pork! 
Decor is boring but with food this good, who cares! 
Easily on par with some great BBQ I've tasted state side.
Great find in Newmarket!"}
{"text":"You can barely notice this place at first since it's a bit tucked away, but I'm glad I have my fellow Yelpers to point this place out! We really enjoyed it here!

I had the half pulled pork with coslaw and an added small fries. He had the beef burger with added small onion rings.. when they say small, it's not small. Big portions and really really good food! The pulled pork seemed dry at first but the flavors are all there and I love the type of bun they use for their burgers/sandwiches. It's soft and thin so you don't get filled by bread and can really enjoy the filling. The fries were so good. Crispy with a good bite, and there's the potatoes skin for the added crunch. 

The onion rings were perfect! Exactly the thin, audible crunchy texture you're looking for. I could have definitely had a giant basket of just those ha-ha!!

Last but not least, the chef and the host were amazing. Checked up on us a few times and made friendly conversion with everyone. Such a cozy, lovely environment with amazing food. Nothing too fancy. Just good and soulful. 

Try it out!!"}
{"text":"Visited with family last week..Great friendly service and spectacular tasty pulled pork...Burgers were highly rated in taste and prices were good.Highly recommended this I will be back...I wish I didn't live so far!"}
{"text":"OMG XXX BBQ Sauce house made with Ghost Pepper! Just proceed with caution.

And of course there are other BBQ sauce: Sweet or Hickory for you to choose from.

We shared: 

Ribs and Brisket ($24.95) 1/2 Rack of Ribs and 1 lb of Brisket with fries, coleslaw and beans.

Brisket was tender and fatty, Ribs was meaty and flavoured. And go so well with whatever BBQ sauce you choose!

Staff here is all so friendly and nice. Though the dining area looks like a self serve takeout joint, they do offers full table service.

Ricky's Cookhouse is good place if you have craving for some good meat in the area. May not worth a special trip...but I would for the OMG XXX BBQ Sauce!"}
