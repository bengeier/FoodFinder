{"text":"Coup de cur pour ce nouveau restaurant japonais du mile end! 

J'ai goûté plusieurs de leur plats, sur place ou à emporter et jamais déçue.
Prix raisonnables et ambiance agréable sur place, leur ramen épicé (shogun) et leur Udon à la crème sont à tombés. 
Un de mes nouveaux favoris!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars. I had a Tokyo ramen for $13. It was one of the best I've had in Montreal. It appeared to be a Tonkotsu broth and it was light yet flavorful without being too salty. It came with two slices of grilled, tender pork belly (and you could tell the pork was rolled up prior to being sliced since the meat and fat form a swirl pattern, the only other place I know that does this is Ramen Misoya). The bowl also had a whole marinated egg with runny yoke. The ramen has a simple garnish of thinly sliced leek (shiraga negi) which complements the ramen really well. The curly noodles were fine and comparable to other places. The matcha tiramisu has great texture and was not too sweet. It also came with a cup of green tea.

In a second visit I tried the karaage (fried chicken) and it's quite good, a bit different than other places but it had balanced flavors, not too strong or too weak and it wasn't oily. The ninja ramen tasted good but wasn't worth the price considering it has no protein. The prune sake was amazing.

The place isn't big but there are a decent number of tables and the decor is mostly black.

{"text":"Excellent Ramen au cur du Mile-End, une perle rare. 
La déco est simple avec plusieurs petite touches typiquement japonaises. Un petit bémol par contre sur la propreté de la grande fenêtre, difficile à excuser quand on a pignon sur rue...
Nous avons commencé notre repas par l'entrée de poulet frit (karaage). C'était franchement un des meilleurs que j'ai mangé! La panure est légère et croustillante, le poulet tendre, pas gras (contrairement à plusieurs lorsqu'on utilise le haut de cuisse) et parfaitement assaisonné. La présentation est jolie et tous les accompagnements font de ce plat l'introduction parfaite à ce qui vient ensuite.
Le Tokyo Ramen frise la perfection. La présentation est superbe, les nouilles sont fermes, les ufs tendres et coulants, le bouillon crémeux mais léger à la fois. La star de ce plat est sans aucun doute le porc chasu; moelleux, généreux et extrêmement savoureux. J'ai rajouter un peu de pâte de piment fermenté qui rajoute une touche de sucré et de piquant pour atteindre l'équilibre parfait. Le 7e ciel n'est pas bien loin...
Quant au Ninja Ramen, le bouillon est aussi riche mais légèrement plus salé (un peu trop pour moi) et comme c'est végé, je conseille d'ajouter un uf ou du porc. Le fromage gratiné est une touche intéressant mais il se défait mal et ne fond pas. Je pense que ça serait mieux si c'était râpé. 

Ceci dit, je retournerai volontiers à ce resto pour un de ces succulent Ramen.
Demain et peut-être le jour suivant..."}
{"text":"LOVED THIS PLACE. Everything is served with care and attention. The staff is so nice and welcoming.

Started with the sushi entrée, which was super fancy looking and interesting. It was warm sticky rice with some slightly spicy salmon on top.

Ordered the Tokyo noodles and the fried chicken and it was all delicious. Japanese food that isn't sushi is a bit out of my wheelhouse but I'm so glad I got to try this place out and feel a bit bold in my choices (even though it was chicken and noodles).

The location is very close to my house, and so I know it's gone through many owners and businesses. That's why the inside never really matches the business. There's some empty space and the layout is kind awkward. You can tell the kitchen was built with a different restaurant in mind. But I still love what they managed to do with the place. 

Their meals are just so cool and original (and delicious), I'd go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Small menu but food was delicious. We were craving ramen and this place came up on yelp. We were not disappointed. Tokyo and spicy ramen were perfect. Rich broth, not too salty. Good portions. Definitely one of the best ramen we've tasted in the city. We also had dessert... the matcha tiramisu was phenomenal! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! Ramen was absolutely amazing and very filling. The soup broth was especially delicious. The friend chicken was very nicely made and tasted great. The matcha tiramisu is also something to try. Couldn't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Excellent ramen!! I got the Tokyo style and the broth and pork belly pieces were so refreshing. The octopus sashimi, chicken karaage, and sushi pieces were memorable as well. Loved the service there as everyone is so welcoming and nice. Would definitely go back to try the Shogun ramen bowl!"}
{"text":"Excellente place ! Petit menu mais très bon plats. On s'est partagé un ramen et le karaage-don, les 2 étaient parfaits. N'habitant pas très loin je risque d'y retourner régulièrement. Rien à redire sur le service. Les prix sont corrects. J'ai déjà envie d'y retourner !"}
{"text":"As part of the Japanese cuisine boom in Montreal, a refreshing new address named Cocoro, meaning \"heart\" in Japanese, has been born. The interior is modest but clean, nested in the middle of Mile-End; without doubt the idea is to concentrate on the food, as opposed to many rapidly opening Isakayas in downtown.

With a simple menu as seen on yelp, I was expecting nothing more but simple, good old comfort food. After receiving my appetizer which was a Japanese Carpaccio, I looked around and thought I was in the wrong restaurant. The meticulously presented dish reminded me of a Monet painting, with strokes of natural colors, accentuating the sea bass. The coulis accompanying the dish really stuck to in memory, anchored there by a tangy hint of lime and passion fruit. The pesto might have been unnecessary as it overpowered the taste of the delicate fish.

Next, my tempura arrived, and again I had to remind myself I'm not in a Michelin star restaurant. This was the best dish of the evening. The perfectly seasoned batter was made of corn starch which was so light and crispy you can see thru it. The flavors were so well balanced, even though your mind unconsciously wants to dip it somewhere, it was totally unnecessary. Every bite was a surprise as it enveloped delicate pieces of eggplants, shrimp, asparagus and a fresh squid.

As my shogun rice dish finally arrived, at this point I knew it could not disappoint. The thick broth enveloped every grain of my perfectly cooked pearl-like rice. Since my culinary handicap is that I can't have gluten, I really appreciated the option to replace noodle by rice. Even though it would blow my mind, I hope one day they can offer gluten-free noodles.

I ordered a side of chashu; the fatty ratio was just perfect, that instantly melt-in-my-mouth smoky tender pork really hit the spot. I would just come back, order a dish of chashu over rice and call it a night.

But I couldn't end a meal like this having had the amazing experience so far; yes, greed is my blessing. So I chose the matcha cheesecake. It was so light, so delicate yet extremely creamy since they incorporated so much air in that cream, sitting on a bed of a smooth matcha cake, you hardly feel like you had desert at all. So that last taste sent the right message, see you soon.

Chef Mitsu worked at an Italian restaurant in Shinjuku, the trendy neighborhood of Tokyo, which explained the pesto in the carpaccio and the tomato coulis with the tempura. That is a ballsy move, yet a personal and unique signature move. He also explained to me, they tried with Udon when the restaurant first opened and Montrealers didn't really fell for that, I said well people need to be educated about Japanese cuisine, we can't have a ramen shop at every corner of the street, because that would be boring, except in Japan! And he laughed as he quickly got back to the evening prep."}
