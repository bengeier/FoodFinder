{"text":"There is not a better bounce place in the valley. This place is owned by a very nice and sweet family.  They take pride in their business and it shows.  Everyone who works here are completely friendly and nice. This place is kept so clean and they are always cleaning.   Whenever we go to Bouncy World we feel like we are visiting friends.  It feels like a safe environment and there are staff near the bounce houses watching after the kids. Not to mention it is filled with awesome bounce houses.  This place is a must if you have kids with lots of energy that like to bounce. If I could give more than 5 stars I would. Classy place run by a classy family."}
{"text":"This place was really fun and the staff was awesome. They keep everything super clean and there is plenty of fun things for all kids to play with."}
{"text":"New, clean, great staff, 10 large bounce/basketball/slide/obstacle course inflatable play areas. The snack bar has baked kid-friendly  food that tastes great! Little kid area was perfect for my timid 4 year old and includes slides, bounce area and mini ball pit. We watched college football games in the lounge area and were offered a remote to put on anything we wanted to watch. To top it off  the bathrooms were VERY clean (always a plus).  New favorite place!"}
{"text":"It was our first time to visit Bouncy World in Henderson. It was such a great experience. We were impressed from A to Z; professional customer service, management very caring, verity of jumpers and games, delicious food and very clean. Mike and his team made sure we had amazing time. My son Gary enjoyed his 9th Birthday very much. Keep it up good work guys!!! We'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Just had another birthday celebration at bouncy world. My daughter's favorite place. Mike and his staff are always welcoming and very accommodating. Would definitely recommend this place for any of your events."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My fianc√© and I took our kids for dinner and playtime. The staff is great, along with bring extremely friendly, they played with our kids too. Food was tasty and decently priced. Plus all baked, no fryers. Great place for all ages. We will be back often."}
{"text":"A few of us from work brought our kid there after we got off from work and I have to say this place was huge.  I have 2 girls age 5 and 7.  They both love this place, we like how they can just jump anywhere and not have a time limit on jumping.  Also they even had a x-box game so if they got tired they can play x-box games.  And as for their food I like that they bake them rather than being fried.  Im looking forward to what they told me that theres going to be a spot for a adult lounge to relax while the kids will be playing, just a place where the chairs will be comfy and relaxing where you can watch the big screen TV.  I definitely will bring my kids back and for sure telling all my friends about this place.  GOOD JOB BOUNCY WORLD"}
{"text":"Very nice establishment. My 4 year old loves it here and asks to come back everyday. I know there are similar options in town bit this place is clean and cool and a great place to beat the summer heat. You could spend all day here due to comfy chairs and a decent food menu selection.   In the few times I have been here, the staff has been very friendly and willing to answer any questions I had.   I will continue coming here and so no reason to go anywhere else at this point."}
{"text":"Cleanest bouncy house place you'll find. The employees are really nice every time we come in, and the kids love it there. Don't have to pay extra for air hockey or video games, they have a special section for little kids to bounce and play. Between friends we all agree this is the best place to take your kids to."}
{"text":"Bouncy World is an awesome place for my kids to let out some energy and allow their imaginations go to work. $11 per person for a full day pass to jump is more than reasonable especially when you have children that like to jump on your expensive leather couch at home. The BOUNCERS are CLEAN here! Also, they are free of the infamous, pungent foot odor these things are likely to have as a result of them not being properly maintained and cared for. The restrooms are CLEAN here too, which is great because I have a 4yr old that likes to lean against the toilet when he handles his business.   We have walk-in parties for our boys (4yr and 5yr) every year and the managers and staff are always accomodating to our needs. We normally celebrate parties on a Saturday, but this place gets busy upon opening. I recommend anyone doing a walk-in on a Saturday to get here early or have parties during the start or middle of the week. You're allowed to bring cake and ice cream inside, but no other outside food or drink is allowed.   The food offered here is good. Everything on the menu are foods they bake in their pizza oven. My expectation of the pizza during our first visit was low, but it turned out to be better than a lot of pizza take out restaurants I've had around town. Kids love the chicken fingers. Pizza, fingers and wings are moderately priced. Snacks and drinks are inexpensive.   I always see one of the owners/managers making rounds around the bouncers. The staff here are very attentative to the surroundings so children don't hurt themselves. I would advise parents to supervise their children when they are bouncing with other kids because accidents happen (...and if you're my youngest and incredibly clumsy son, accidents will happen all the time).   In closing, this place is awesome. I will continue to bring my kids to Bouncy World so long as they continue to keep they're standards up...and also to save my couch."}
{"text":"Great place reasonably priced admission and snacks. Friendly Owner on site working the front and the staff was friendly!! Definitely a great place to bring the kids or grandkids!"}
{"text":"I like this place.  Kids can play freely.  I brought my 11 year old, my 7 year old daughters and her cousins 12 and 9 and they had a blast! If I am being picky I would say that I don't like that they don't allow water inside the building.  It should be the customer's choice whether to want to bring water or buy it from their venues.  The security needs improvement because anyone can walk out with a child.  Overall, is a great place for kids to have fun and enjoy themselves.  It is just like a kids party!"}
{"text":"Took my kids here twice. This place is great. Friendly staff. My kids really enjoyed the PlayStation games. That was a first something you don't see at bouncy houses. All the bouncy houses were very new with pretty bright colors. Just puts you in a happy mood. We will go again :)"}
{"text":"Super clean super nice great staff great food lots of fun for the kids super clean super nice but what's up with the hot sauce can we step the game up a little bit  on the hot sauce please we always order the chicken fingers which are fantastic but the hot sauce is not hot at all not even in the slightest bit :( overall review the five stars looking for a fun place for the kids Id take them... :)"}
{"text":"When coming here I was expecting more but upon arriving we were greeted with horrible customer service and we were not aware that adults had to wear socks so we had to pay $3 per pair. Overall, the kids had a blast jumping but it only lasted so long before they got bored. Not worth the $12 admission at all."}
{"text":"Bouncy World was on our Pogo Pass. Will definitely be back again. Family owned. Staff very friendly and always checking on parents if we need anything. Forgot socks? That's ok. They sell you a pair. Very clean place. Very comfy for parents and nursing mom's with couches, tv's and fans. A food area. Lots of things to play on. A large party area. And cheap! $10 all day!!!!!"}
{"text":"When I first walked in with two children there was no one to greet you when I first made contact with personnel it was more hurry up let's get through this process. The rude person who helped us ,was so in a hurry he just wanted us to sign the paperwork and go turned out he was the owner or so he said."}
{"text":"WE LOVE THIS PLACE !! We've been here 5 times and my family of 7 loves it !! Like 16 of my friends have went 1 to 3 times already and they love it !! We Love the staff,they are so involved with the kids!! They have great food and everything is baked..The staff constantly checks to make sure everything's ok..I've never been to another indoor kids place that has made me and my family feel at home !!"}
{"text":"This place is huge. My 4 year old thought it was pretty fun but my 18 month old didn't care for it too much. Staff was friendly. Clean facility!"}
{"text":"Kids had an amazing time, great food and clean environment! Will be coming back soon! Thanks for great service too"}
{"text":"Perfect place to bring your kids for a day of fun! Bouncy world is not only fun but the cleanest indoor play place I've ever visited. A major part of keeping it clean is the no shoes allowed rule & you have to have on socks rule. While some may view this as in inconvenience it's really a cautionary measure to insure the cleanliness & safety of everyone ( if you're not aware of how many germs are on the bottom of your shoes look it up). Ventilation is vital especially here in Vegas & it never smells like feet in there. It's always fresh & really exceeds expectations of cleanliness for an environment that has little ones running around! Anyways Bouncy World is by far my daughters favorite place at the moment & I'm happy to support her love for this place as the staff is full of great people with amazing customer service. We'd be here everyday if she had it her way, see you soon bouncy world!"}
{"text":"I have to give this place props! Went for pretty much the whole day on Friday! The kids had a blast. Everyone there was so nice. The pizzas and chicken tenders were great! The owner, I believe was on top of clean up the whole time. The place stays spotless. A young lady that serves the food even waited for me to finish drying my hands so she could hold the bathroom door me. I feel she went above and beyond hospitality that I expected. I will definitely be back and recommend this place to my friends!!! Thank you Bouncy World!"}
{"text":"Bouncy World is a fun, clean, and friendly place to go with your kids! The staff was above and beyond friendly with our play date kids group and checked on us parents to make sure we were happy and comfortable. It was extremely clean and the food was delicious. This place is exceptional and far exceeds any other kids bounce / playground businesses I have been to."}
{"text":"My grandkids like BounceU much better.  They are 8 and 10.  This place is WAY too hot.  After 10 minutes the kids were done.  They did refund my money though since we were there such a short time."}
{"text":"Fun play for my 5 year old to let out some energy from being cooped in a hotel all day! The owner, Mike, has checked on us a few times to see if we are in need of anything. Awesome customer service and good prices on the food. Very clean. ADULTS: even if you don't plan on jumping, you are still required to bring socks!!"}
{"text":"Great place. Been twice & the kids love it! They could spend hours here. Reasonably priced food at the snack bar. Also very clean."}
{"text":"I have to agree with a previous review written by Rocco, the staff is rude and they think that being jerks is the way proper customer service should be provided.....ahhhhh wrong!   I have taken my son to Bouncy World twice. The first time it was a very pleasant experience and the staff was very friendly. My son had a blast running all over the place. When we were leaving  I was approached by a man whom I believe is the owner and he asked how everything was and if my son had a nice time, I  told him I would definitely be back again.   So here is where everything goes down hill, I took my son for the second time. When we walked in the guy at the front, I like to call him Slick, the type the person who thinks that gainful employment is for the peasants and he is just too cool to be working! So slick asked me how old my son was and I said 19 months, so slick decides to roll his eyes at me and say \" God I wish parent would stop telling me the age of their kids in months, I hate it, and I suppose to guess how old he is, so how old is he?\" Ok, slick sorry that basic math stumps you, but there is no need for the attitude. I politely smiled and told him wait until your parent and told him my son is not 2 years old yet.   Seriously, you hate when parents tell you their children's ages in months, but yet you work at place that is for kids? In addition the other staff members are on their phones, try asking them a question and you get attitude back in your face.    I really hope that the owner realizes what a detriment his staff is to his business and perhaps he should hire people who actually like children, who want to work and are courteous. Make these changes I will be back again, for now I'm sticking to Kangamoo!"}
{"text":"This place just opened up and we decided to try it due to great reviews both here and on Facebook. Plus it's super close to where we live. The place is amazingly spotless and crews are constantly cleaning the houses. Not a speck of dirt on carpets too! They have a good amount and variety of bounce houses to accommodate kids of all ages, even adults! They have a basketball bounce house for adults to play on. The party room is spacious and nice as well. Will definitely book a party there. The owner is really nice as well and everyone is so friendly there, always asking us if we're having a great time. :-) definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I can't believe the friendly staff, but I guess that would happen, because it's family owned and run. We went twice so far and friday was a birthday party. My daughter had a blast and we will be throwing her birthday party there. The food is great, very clean, lots for the kids to do, and a sitting area for adults. The price is very affordable!  Great experience and best jumpy place in vegas! They do not charge for adults and the place is very well lit and heated. Loved the pizza!!! That ugly post is a lie!!! See yourself. Extremely accommodating."}
{"text":"I agree with every positive thing mentioned below.  This place is brand new and is great.  A couple of more chairs or beanbag chairs around the place for the parents would be great but other than that it is great. Good job to Mike the owner.  I hope it stays this great.  Oh, maybe an oversight by the staff but I clearly have a cup of coffee and a juice box on my table and there has not been one word said.  Whomever that Anastasia woman was that reviewed it so badly should stick with the dirty And nasty other two in Green Valley."}
{"text":"This place is great. Staff is friendly and more than helpful. It's always clean and it's a great place to have your little one's birthday party. I can't recommend it enough. We've had our sons birthday party here two years in a row now."}
{"text":"My granddaughters really had a great time today! The place is very clean, the employees were well trained and very nice. The price is reasonable and you can stay as long as you want for one price which is awesome! The lounge for parents was comfortable, and the snack bar was convenient and not over-priced.   We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I take my daughter here often. We love it. Friendly staff with a good selection of bouncy houses for kids of all ages. I haven't tried the food yet, but it looks good. I also like the fact that the facility is larger than most here in town, it's probably the biggest and it's all in one big room, which makes it much easier to keep track of your kids. They could definitely use some more seating in the snack area and more seating for the adults in general but I'm not complaining, since I'm usually following my kid around the place keeping an eye on her. Bounce-Bounce!"}
{"text":"This place really fell far below my expectations. The building is huge, but they have very few bouncy houses. My 4 year old daughter was not nearly as excited walking in as she is by bounceu or pump it up.   We proceeded to pay and were told that parents had to wear socks as well. Well it's funny that wasn't stated on the website which I had read thoroughly before visiting. After now reading other reviews I see that nearly all parents had to pay the outrageous price of 3.00 a pair for socks. I have taken my child to every child friendly indoor museum, playground, jump zone and never had this issue.  I looked at the two men behind the counter like they were crazy because obviously a 5 month pregnant lady isn't going to jump on the bouncy houses. Then they inform me the whole place is shoe free. (Which by the looks of the place isn't for sanitary reasons but rather to save their newly installed carpet).  You would think this \"rule\" would be posted on the front door, the website, the front counter, but no it's just a very ghetto for them to make money.  Which by the way the whole place felt very shady and unprofessional.    I'm really glad I told them they were crazy if they thought I was paying 6 dollars for socks when I could go down the street to bounceu or pumpitup.   We ended up leaving and taking my daughter to pump it and good thing we did because if they had told me I couldn't bring in a friggin bottled water for my daughter I really would have lost it.   We don't eat fast food and they only offer pizza, nuggets, etc.  I wouldn't have been able to bring in any healthy snacks nor purchase anything. So no not child or Family friendly like every other place in the valley.  All in all, there are better facilities nearby with much friendlier staff and no crazy rules.  This bouncy world just wants to make money in every way they could fathom.  Keep your crap food, horrible customer service, and overpriced socks. We will take our business elsewhere where the customer comes first."}
{"text":"Never heard of this place until I typed \"things to do with kids\" on Yelp...This place is AMAZING!! $10 per child ALL DAY, open every day. The employees are soooo chill and it's a fun and relaxing place. It's clean and there's tons of space for parents to sit. They even have food you can buy inside (yes, food, not just chips and candy). Pizza, French fries, chicken wings, chicken fingers, etc. You can see right into the kitchen and everything is clean. I just spent over $60 for about an hour at the pumpkin patch, so this such a great deal and gets the kids off the couch.   There are employees roaming around but they're happy! I just saw a couple of kids fighting over a ball, and I thought the monitor was going over to them to tell them to play nice or something, but he playfully grabbed the ball and played catch with them while all the other kids ran after him. It's a fun place! Thank you, Yelp!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed bouncy world yet but I love it! We've been coming here a lot since it opened. We've been here for open bounce (literally almost 100 times) and many many parties (about 12) and could not be happier with the service and quality. The cleanliness and operating hours make it the most attractive option for indoor play out there. Best of all is the kindness of the employees and owners. Thank you for providing a fun and safe place to escape the heat and cold!"}
{"text":"Just had my son's 3rd birthday party here. Everyone had a great time!! I originally wasn't too keen on the idea of not being able to bring in my own water bottles or cups, but I understand the legality of their reasoning and everything worked out just fine anyway. (It only takes one irresponsible moron to ruin it for everyone else!) The staff was friendly and helpful. The owner checked in on us to make sure everything was good and our party attendant was on point!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND CHELSEA!! The private party room with its own bounce house and slide was a huge hit and so amazing for the party guests to have fun without worrying about the big kids taking over, especially since the majority of our guests were 2-4 yrs old. But they were also able to go out with the masses and play with everything too. This place is huge (and clean) and it was nice to have a large space for the birthday party without feeling crammed into a small room. We will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"We came here for our daughters 4th birthday party. We rented the private party room. The cost for 3 hours was $350. This includes a private room that was a great size, 3 pizzas and 20 chicken strips, three pitchers of your choice of drink, cups, plates, and utensils. That was all great. The room was a great size, they have a Bluetooth speaker and tables and chairs with ample seating. The reason that I am giving 3 stars is that the staff is all 16 year old kids with major attitudes. When we first arrived, they didn't explain exactly what was included in the package. They didn't allow us to bring in bottle water (it was 112 out) and they made us put the case of water back in the car. The young girl who was supposed to be our host asked what she could do to help. I asked her to put up the decorations. She hung one thing (that fell off the wall) and left the room. Also, when we drank The two pitchers of water, I had to remind her to refill it and she disappeared again. The room was very hot. It had fans in it but it could have easily been ten degrees cooler. After the food came out, the host came up to me and informed me that she was ready to cut the cake. My daughter was still eating so I told her to wait. She stood against the wall rolling her eyes as if I was wasting her time. The other employee was sloppy and disgusting and I didn't want her touching any of my food. She came in chomping on gum and looked like she was stoned. All in all we ended up spending an extra $60 for cups. They told us it was extra for jumpers, not to hydrate people. The party would have been perfect with clearer party instructions and a completely different staff. It's not likely we will return."}
{"text":"It's 100 degrees outside and they won't let you bring in water for you kids.  The service is poor.  I won't go back, ever."}
{"text":"Another successful birthday party at Bouncy World!!! Definitely five stars, much better than Chucky cheese or anywhere else in town to have a party. The owners are great, staff is wonderful, very clean, lots of space for the kids to run, they have video games for the older kids, and bouncy's ranging from toddler all the way up to the oldest all ages can enjoy bouncy world!! I might have next years party here again!!!"}
{"text":"My 5yr old son's classmate celebrated his birthday here. First impression was good. Lots of room, not over crowded and civilized clientele. I was also surprised at the level of cleanliness especially, considering the numbers of families they host and how clean my white issued socks were after spending 3hrs there. As a party guest I didn't absorb any expenses which was extremely thoughtful and very grateful to them. I can't comment on the food unfortunately as I arrived with a full belly and my son showing no interest eating and losing anytime having a blast with his friends. I'm not big on public places and socializing with other parents mainly because they can be annoying but I bite the bullet for my children and I can honestly say it was stress free and my child would have gladly stayed there till closing."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful place. My 4 year old and 8 year old nephew love this place. Staff couldn't be nicer and more welcoming. Food is great too. Best play place in the city, in my opinion. So glad this opened up."}
{"text":"My kids had a great time it was a little hectic and my daughter was a bit young for the crowd I think she will have a much better experience when she's 3.5 or 4"}
{"text":"My son, niece, and nephews love this place, definitely worth it! So much for the kiddos to do, all ages. My younger brothers (8) and (13) love coming."}
{"text":"my boys rlly loved all the different bounce houses, & it was VERY clean which is what as a mother i look for. the price is about average compared to other indoor toddler play areas. i also rlly liked how they had giant fans, i got super hot a couple of times chasing my toddlers around & it was nice to cool down. the food took a rlly long time to get out, but i like that they made it fresh. my only complaint was when i called to get hours/prices etc the woman who answered was pretty rude like i was bothering her when i was trying to get my questions answered. she was very short with me & not welcoming at all! luckily we had a male gentleman check us in. my boys would probably love to go back. & open until 9pm is also awesome!"}
{"text":"I took my 3yr old daughter here and she absolutely loved it. Everything is new and clean. They have a small cafe with food and drinks and TVS everywhere for sports/cartoons. They also have 4 playstations set up with different games for older kids. The area is very spacious. Fun for all ages!"}
{"text":"While I was at work my husband brought son to Bouncy World on Stephanie/American Pacific. Now I just brought Him back. This place is pretty neat 12 bouncy house things, video games,couches/chairs/tvs for parents, a snack bar with tables & chairs, & the staff have all been very nice. Mon-Thursday $10 for wristband (open jump 11am-8pm), fri-sun $12 for wristband."}
{"text":"We used to love this place, but it has really gone down hill. The staff no longer engages with the kids, the owner is never around anymore, there is little to no A/C, just industrial fans that blow stuffy sweaty air around. The free air hockey tables have been replaced with a bunch of machines that all cost extra money after you already pay $12 a kid to get in (if you have an issue with the machine eating your money -we did- they will not accept responsibility. They say there is nothing they can do about it.) There is no one monitoring the video game area, which unlike a regular arcade where your turn ends, these games have infinite lives and there is no time limit and no one enforcing any kind of turn taking or sharing. Yeah, I paid to have my kid stand in line to play a video game for half an hour, only to still not get a turn and give up. That's fun. Families are also forbidden from bringing water bottles in and forced to buy their overpriced water or drink from the germy water fountain. When you have a bunch of kids, that really adds up!  Like I said, we used to love this place. I would rave to my friends about it and we had all our playdates there in the summer. It was a local, family run facility that cared about the customers and would always have a friendly greeting and had staff that would play ball with the kids and at least pretended like they enjoyed being there. Now, when I walk in, it smells, it's stuffy and all the staff look miserable and only interact if it's to point out your contraband, not to keep teens out of the toddler section. I don't recognize anyone and never see the owner. I hope this business takes a look at what's going on and makes some improvements to these problems. If they did, we might consider going back.  Until then, aside from attending a birthday party, Im not bringing my family back here. There are way too many other options in this town."}
{"text":"Awful. We were kicked out within 15 min by the manager. My son had a ball thrown at him by one kid and then another kid punched him so he fought back and the manager ran to break them up. He tried to remove my son from the situation so my son was kicking and hitting for the manager to let go and the manager made us leave because he was a threat to his (the managers) safety and since he was the oldest of the boys fighting it was best he left. He was actually the youngest (he's 4 they were 5) and I teach my kid if a stranger EVER lays a hang on him to kick and hit and scream until I get him or they let go so he did exactly what he has been told. The manager said that stranger danger is crap and no excuse because it's a children's place. I explained strangers are strangers anywhere and children are kidnapped from children's places. Plus a staff member should never pull the arm of a child because it can be easily dislocated. He said my son should have known he was the manager because everyone else does (I didn't) and my son doesn't even know what a manager is. Sure he had a bouncy world t shirt on but my son has never even been there before and probably didn't even notice his shirt as some scary man is trying to grab him. Not even 15 min of play and had to leave. That's awful management, it definitely should have been handled way differently. When he was dragging my son up to me he said he has to go, no explaination or anything then came back and said he's a threat to staff safety he needs to leave."}
{"text":"Awesome place - very clean, organized and well maintained. Staff is very friendly and helpful - they interact and play with the kiddos and get them excited to play! Definitely recommend, worth the money and most definitely will return."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  Walked in 3pm on a Saturday with no reservation and the staff lead the way to a table near the TV so dads could watch sports! Plenty of room with lots of huge fans to keep the air circulating. Brought our  own cake and ice cream and decorations. Food was good better then chucke cheese and free refills on drinks!  Definitely going back very reasonable and kids are wiped!  Thank you for providing a clean fun place for kids!"}
{"text":"There are a couple bounce places I take my two-year-old daughter. This is my first visit to bounce world. I came because they were offering a discounted rate with Groupon. The bounce world website says that a child two years of age or younger gets in free with the price of an adult admission.   When I came to their location they would not honor my Groupon as an adult admission. They only would apply it for my two-year-old daughter and I could only watch and not play with her.  There is significant false advertising going on.   Neither organization has any fine print saying that it excludes full price adults. When trying to resolve the issue with the workers they were all very rude. In addition to not being able to play with my daughter, when she had to use the bathroom bounce world requires you to go into the bathrooms barefoot. This is a significant hygiene issue especially considering there was toilet paper and urine on the floor.  They strictly prohibits any footwear past the gates even though the floor is tile. I understand you should not wear footwear in the bounce areas but in the bathrooms is ridiculous.  There's another bouncy place called bounce u only a few miles from this establishment. I highly recommend you take your business there."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I've been taking my son here since it opened. There's so much for the kids to do and the couches are nice an comfortable for the parents. The snack bar is well priced and wifi ! Our son has a blast every time :)"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic.  From the minute I walked in the door the staff made sure that I had what I needed.  There were some special requirements that I had and each one was met with a can do attitude.  The customer service was the best and being greeted by the owner was a special touch.  I was very impressed by the staffs caring and careful watching of the children in the facility. It is clean, has a great area for parents and lots of room for the kids to play.   I am recommending Bouncy World to all my friends and family with children.  Best $20.00 ever spent on child entertainment, exercise. food, drink and souvenir."}
{"text":"First experience was a great one.  Owners and staff were very helpful and polite, they even jump in on the fun themselves from time to time (but not in an obnoxious way).  My son loved running around the different bounce houses and really enjoyed the gaming area. The private parties are on the more expensive side but it may be worth it, we may give it a try for a birthday coming up.  Will update afterwords."}
{"text":"Absolutely WILL NEVER GO There again ! I was going for my girlfriends son birthday party. I walk in not realizing I need socks as well as the kids. So I was going to buy a pair and the sign said \" 3$\". All I said is 3$ for a pair of socks is a lot . Just a comment , not really rude . The OWNER said \" if I don't like it , I can leave !\" I would expect that kind of thing from a worker....maybe, NOT The owner . He also told me I can buy socks for 2$ across the street. Funny thing is it wasn't about the 3$ at that point . It what his reaction to it was. He obviously is a money hungry jerk and taken advantage of people . I go all over with my kids, run for fun and kangaroos...all 1$ for socks . He's a rip OFF! Also, the girl who worked the party dropped my friends 80$ cake with only a quarter dished out . They didn't do anything about it. So the story goes on , my son has a seizure disorder and can't have certain foods , I had to bring my own shake for him . Mind you , he can go into a seizure given certain foods all of which they carry . NOT EVEN Water is free lol. So they told me to put the drink away and given the situation which already happened ....I said \" NO\" . Who the hell runs a business like that? And you can't have a pitcher of water without paying for it? A joke ! NEVER EVER EVER swill I walk in there and will let everyone know my experience. Oh btw the pizza taste like cardboard too. They could car less about anything but making sure they take advantage of people and take their money . Do yourself a favor spend your dollar somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great place to be....the food is great the staff wonderful and the owner works too along side with his family as well....dont take my word for it come down u well love this place for the kids and the grown ups as well....wow best pizza in town...and omg with the bathrooms there soooooooooo clean i can sit there and eat my food not kidding....come down check this place out....remember bring ur socks only socks..."}
{"text":"I love this place! First off, it's completely spotless. Second, the workers are nice. I spoke with both the owner and his mom and they were lovely. Extremely friendly people. My kids loved the different bounce houses and I loved the separate toddler area for my 1 year old. I'll definitely come back a lot this summer!"}
{"text":"Was a fun experience everyone that worked there were really friendly, and made sure we all were ok checked on us and kept the place clean. Happy environment the kids loved it there.  They just need better tasting  pizza and different sauce on them."}
{"text":"I've been to Bouncy World a few times with my 4 year old. We went today, and we will no longer be coming here. I understand it's a kids place, and kids just want to have fun. It's a place for jumping, rough-housing, and running around like psychos as only kids do. I get it, I really do. But when it comes to a safety issue, I feel like the staff needs to do more (well, let's be honest, the parents SHOULD do more, but that's another issue). Some older kids were using the jumbo slide as a jump house, jumping and climbing the dividers between slide lanes. They were also climbing up the slide, preventing kids from coming down. That slide is easily 20 ft tall and it isn't watched by the staff. Staff walks around with labeled shirts, but I often saw them standing and talking in groups or sitting in the snack bar.   And yes, I hate that you can't bring water in with you. It's the desert for goodness sakes. The water fountain was also leaking, with water all over the stool in front of it."}
{"text":"Awesome place to take your kids for fun and exercise!!! The price is fair and best of all the place is clean with fun and friendly staff... Family owned for great family fun!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. I was there for a birthday party today and they didn't tell the parents of the birthday girl the AC was broken. It was 117 today, IT WAS HOT IN THERE. They tried with big fans but it hardly helped. It was miserable. I'm very clearly 9 months pregnant and brought a water bottle with me and thank God because we got there to find out the AC was broken! Half way through the party a girl asked me to take it outside because there aren't any water containers allowed due to a previous incidence with people bringing alcohol. I understand, rules are rules. HOWEVER, it's Las Vegas, it's summer, it's 117, your AC is broken and I'm 9 months pregnant! There's really no room for an exception? They also gave my sister a hard time about her water bottle while she was actively nursing her baby. I took them outside and waited for more cups to be brought to the table while the employee filled the water pitchers one by one instead of bringing them. I'll never be back and I'll never recommend."}
{"text":"The staff at Bouncy World was very rude, and presents themselves as bad asses that have a business, when in actuality they are just rude and will probably be out of business soon.  The idea that there is no signage when you walk in, grey atmosphere, and the cheesy bounce houses that come from a random party supply store turned me off right away.  If this place is meant for children,  make it look festive and fun, not like a prison.  Not allowing your guests to bring in water is also not a good way to create a community, especially when water is $2.00 in a Styrofoam cup. Water in  Las Vegas is essential, and water for your children is essential!!  Our friend was playing with his son, and the staff member rudely told him he couldn't play basket ball because he didn't have a red bracelet, what??? he has to pay $12.00 to throw a ball with his son??  Also the no shoe policy for the adults is a no go- going to the bathroom with no shoes on is not my idea of fun.  Advice to management, when a customer voices concerns, apologize and make them happy, don't argue with them and bring it back on the guest. We were told to go ahead and write on their Facebook.. ehh work on your customer services.  There are many other amazing places you can take your children to on a nice rainy day."}
{"text":"10x better than bounce U. Read other reviews and completely agreed plus bathrooms are the cleanest I have seen in any public setting."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Fun times for everyone. Great owners and staff. It's very clean and spacious.  There's enough room for all the kids to run and play. There's TV's and free Wifi for the adults. Keep up the good work. I will be back."}
{"text":"I chose Bouncy World for my son's 4th birthday party. It was a wonderful experience. The staff was gracious and attentive. The place was clean and the kids all had a great time. I had 4-11 years old with me and they all enjoyed the activities. The food was good and the service was perfect.Overall, it was a great family experience hosted by a wonderful family. They deserve a dinner on Papa."}
{"text":"I was here to celebrate a friends kids birthday party, this is 100% from an adult with no kids perspective. Our host had the fully private room which was great as is provided some extra sides and jumping for the kids who were apart of the party.   The disappointment: The awful food and drink!!!!  The pizza's were blah, not much going on there. They turned rubbery after they got cold. The sodas were flat and the water tasted like someone with muddy boots stomped through it. I really think Las Vegas tap water (which it probably was) taste better than this. The only redeeming factor was the chicken strips. They did supply the food in a timely-manner.   I can't imagine how much our host paid for this food and to rent the area, but I can see the attraction to kids as they do have a lot of areas to get their energy out."}
{"text":"Excellent place to bring the little ones! Great deal only $10 a piece for the entire day and you can go in and out till 8pm! The staff it very friendly and having a snack bar with an assortment of unhealthy food is great. The very small children's play places are the same price or more and do not offer a quarter of what this place offers! The only reason I won't come here more often than I do is that it's about 35 min across town from where we live but is well worth the drive every once in a wile! The other great think is that the equipment is high quality and is sturdy enough for adults to enjoy with there children!"}
{"text":"I threw my daughters birthday party here and here is an honest review. The staff was not as awful as everyone is complaining about. We were greeted immediately and our party host introduced herself right away. She wasn't amazing, but was not rude at all. The food is not the best, so I wish they did let you bring in your own food, or at least in addition to what we ordered. I loved he huge private room we got although I was misinformed when I called. I was told you only need a wristband for kids/adults if they were going to jump in the main jumpers, but that anyone could jump in the private room. That is false, everyone who is going to jump period needs a wristband. My BIGGEST complaint is that it is HOT!! I asked about the air conditioner and our host said they were having issues with them working but they do have oversized fans! I would not throw another party in the summer, but would actually consider one in the fall or winter. I've never been there for regular play so this review is based off of a private party."}
{"text":"Very big open space with lots of bounce houses. I like that the place is super clean! They have a toddler room for small kids too. My 3 and five year old sons both really enjoyed it. I would recommend this place its very nice and cool for those hot summer days."}
{"text":"I'm not angry just very disappointed in this place. No customer service whatsoever! Front desk girl seemed unhappy to be working there. I Paid $24 for 20 mins. My son who is 1years old ripped his pants so I took them off and threw them in the trash. I had him playing with his diaper on, staff asked me to leave after 20 mins. I asked for my money in return and they refused. If I were the owner, this is what i would of oferred the customer; 1. Refund customer half of their money back or  2. Given them a pass to return another day.   Manager refused to do either or! I will be disputing transaction with my financial institution."}
{"text":"Due to the extreme rudeness of both the manager and the lady who paints faces my grandson's day was ruined.   Employees here are rude. The manager does nothing but sit at the front counter. He also allows other employees to get in the faces of customers and scream at them. It's amazing the amount of 1 star reviews this place gets that end up in the ''Not Recommended'' area. People have problems with this place.   I did not see one employee clean anything, wipe anything down, or throw any trash away while I was here. In a year it will be a bacteria filled petri dish.   Due to the repulsive behavior of the face painting lady and the unbelievable disregard of customer's feelings by the Manager, Mike Peterson I will never enter this business again.   Watch your children here. Closely. Most of the parents use this as a day care drop off as they plant themselves on a chair up front and stick their face in their phone. The employees stand in the middle of the room, looking bored. The only time they will talk to you is if they see you have a water bottle. Then they're on your case right away.   There's a lot of violence going on in the bouncy houses due to unsupervised children and a manager and staff that doesn't care."}
{"text":"Love this place for my kids. The staff is always so nice and helpful. You can come in the morning and then come back at night again! My kids wear themselves out here. Great for toddlers too!"}
{"text":"So.... my kid loves coming here! He does HAVE A GREAT time! But that is not why I'm putting the 3 stars. My 3 starts is because of the staff working there. Literally like 7 out of 10 of the basically kids that work there look like they do not want to be there. They act very anti social and don't know what they are doing when you talk to them or ask them a question. I ordered wings at their snack bar at around 7pm..... I did NOTTTTT get my food till 8PM!!!! Are you kidding me?!? I had to go up there 3 times for them to REMEMBER that I ordered something! They had forgot to put them to cook  I was starving and ONE HOUR to cook 10 wings? Are you kidding me?! I was about to just tell them to cancel it and just give me my money back and just go next door to eat at the Mexican restaurant! I was very very mad about that. They had about 4 staff people walking around the kitchen area... like really?!?! It also took them like 5 minutes to KNOWLEDGE that I was standing there waiting to order something. Seems like there's a lot of great places here in vegas that are doing great with the idea of their businesses but then they hire a bunch OF MORONS that have no IDEA what they are doing..... this is not the first time that I've gone to bouncy world and they make us wait more then a normal wait time for out food... mind you today there WAS NO ONE there for our food to take an hour to cook. It was literally just us at 7pm..... -.- ridicules!!! I hope next time I go it doesn't happen again because I spend a lot ALOT of money at this place..... they need to be considerate of their customers or else they will lose them and lose money!"}
{"text":"Cleanest place ever!!! As a mom I didn't have to worry about cooties. My socks were still white after walking around for 3 hrs. The staff are very friendly. My son had a great time. Thank you."}
{"text":"After looking around at a few places to celebrate our son's 3rd birthday, bouncy world was the best deal hands down! We looked online and got some info then we went to the location to get some more info and ask a few questions. The staff here are incredibly kind and helpful. They are a family owned and operated business so you can feel the friendly family vibe.  So we got the 20 person package which is  $425. This includes:  - a party host - 3 hour time limit private party room quipped with 2 bouncy house thingys, a TV, speaker, tables and chairs - 4 1 topping pizzas, 25 chicken tenders, 20 souvenir cups with free refills  * $75 dollar deposit needed to hold your spot of these time spots 10 am - 1pm / 2pm - 5pm / 6pm - 9pm. Deposit is refundable if you cancel 15 days before party *  We chose the 6 pm - 9pm slot. We loved it! We got there early and got lucky because the party ahead of us finished early so we got to decorate much earlier. They usually give you 15 mins before hand to do that. There was no rush for us to hurry when the business was getting ready to close.  As they were closing I noticed just how clean the staff and place is. They take really good care of their business. Very impressed with that.  You are also allowed to bring your own cake / cupcakes and fruit and veggie trays. Nothing else.  No outside cups or drinks.  YOU MUST BRING YOUR SOCKS! NO SHOES ALLOWED IN THE BOUNCE HOUSE PLAY AREA!!!  When your done they clean up everything. Our host Ms. Chelsea (I believe her name was) was so helpful. Her gratitude after we tipped her was heartfelt. She was really appreciative. I highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to celebrate their little ones birthday here. I have friends already wanting to book their partys here. It's worth every penny. Id give them 6 stars if i could. Don't miss out and be sure to book ahead of time. They are usually booked."}
{"text":"We just had my grandson's birthday party here!  So affordable! Staff is fabulous! Recommend this place for just a day visit, buy a pass, or have a party there.  You will keep going back!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Kids always have fun and the staff is fantastic.  They are the hardest working staff i have ever seen.  They are constantly cleaning.  I am impressed."}
{"text":"First time writing a review on anything but that's how much this place impressed me. We had our daughter's birthday here this past weekend and it was AWESOME. They literally took care of everything, and we got to relax through out the whole party. We had a hostess by the name of Kami and she was soooo on it. She worked so well with our party and we truly appreciate her letting us relax while she took over. From knowing how to control our big party to knowing when to bring out more food and drinks, to help setting up, cutting and serving the cake. I mean, she was AMAZING! We didn't have to ask her to do anything, she already knew what to do.  So we got a birthday party package which includes a \"Private Room\" for 3hrs(nice big room with about 8 tables, 4 for food, cake, gifts, and the other 4 tables seat your guests, about 12-16 seats per table, 2 jumpers, an inflatable throne for the birthday child and a blue tooth speaker system w/ microphone), wristband to bounce all day for each kid in your party(and adults too if you are including parents to bounce) Hostess, Large pizza(about 16 slices per pizza and you get however many LG pizzas that come with your party pkg), unlimited drinks and chicken fingers(however many come with your pkg). Food was really good and portioned well considering the fact that we had a big party. Surprisingly, we didn't even have to order more food, except for chicken fingers but even that we didn't have to order because we still had more left from the first round! We also ordered some Cod Fish just to try it and MAN o' MAN was that delicious!! That and some of their fries tasted like some good ol' fashioned fish n chips. Overall, the package was very reasonable and worth every penny. Daily prices for bouncing and prices for food and drinks are actually not that bad too.   We had the pleasure of meeting the owner and some of his family members and they were super friendly, loving and caring folks. And this place is super clean. It's a large open space of variety of bounce houses, gaming stations, air hockey, a dining area off to the side and a snack bar. Everyone has to take off their shoes at the front before entering the bounce area, even if your not bouncing. So make sure you come with socks because they wont let you walk barefoot as well, otherwise they have socks to purchase there at the counter. This is a shoe free, socks required establishment so it makes sense to keep up with cleanliness of the place. Even the bathrooms and the lounge area were clean. Yes, they had a lounge area to just chill and hang out, watch TV or do some work while the kids get their bounce on. Super awesome!  We loved it and most importantly all of the kids LOVED it! We'll definitely be back and will be recommending it to others."}
{"text":"1st timers with 5 kids.... Amazingly not jammed packed. Got a Groupon deal for 5/$50, but normally only $12 each. The food is very reasonable & honestly pretty good. Nothing fried everything is baked, free refills.  We'll be back more often, it's a great way for them to burn off the energy & tire themselves out."}
{"text":"Great place, amazing family that runs it! They are so nice, and always happy! Its very clean and they have good food. You can't beat the price!  If you have younger children try taking them early or during the week.  My granddaughter is 2, and she loves it!"}
{"text":"My kid loves this place, oh and \" so do I \" The owner is very hands on with his establishment. The customer service is great, the place is extremely clean. You have to take your shoes off in a decent sized space with chairs and cubbies to put your shoes in before entering the area with the Bounce Houses. The prices are fair, it's plenty of parking because is not on the strip. There is a sitting area with TVs for the parents or guardians to sit while the kids play or you can be like me and join in on the FUN. If ever in Vegas and have little ones! This is the places to go! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"We LOVE coming here, especially during the summer when there are not a lot of options for outside activities. The staff here are phenomenal and truly care about the kids. It's not unusual to see staff running around and playing with the children too. The pricing is fair and reasonable, especially for snacks and food. This is the best place to get emails read and answered while my kiddos play!"}
{"text":"It was a really good place for a birthday party! The staff is so nice! The only down side would have to be it's hot and the pizza.....eh. It wasn't to die for but what can,go expect ya know. It had a great amount of bounce house, some there were a lot of the same houses. They even had an area for air hockey! Which in,my opinion was pretty SWEET! They had a area for video games which probably should have chair but there wasn't any. It could of been better but all in all for just opening a bit a go I would give them a 7.5 out of the 10 :)"}
{"text":"Horrible. You better be hydrated before you go. They had parents sitting toddler cups outside on the shoe rack since you aren't allowed to bring in outside beverages, including water!!!You aren't allowed to bring in water bottles  and they charge 3+ to get a water cup. I sent my daughter to buy a water bottle and they wouldn't provide that. They insisted on water from the soda fountains. Its no reason as a customer we should be hustled for water. It's ridiculous. We live in the desert and it over a 100 degree out here."}
{"text":"I moved to Vegas last July to be closer to my daughter. In looking for things to do with her, I found Bouncy World on Google.  Bouncy World is an awesome place to take your kids for a full day of fun. An excellent, well maintained and air conditioned facility, the kids can jump all day, play video games and air hockey to their little heart's content. Parents can relax in the open lounge area while enjoying their favorite show on the big screen televisions. They also serve food, and I must say, \"I didn't know baked chicken wings could taste so good!"}
{"text":"Great place! Lots of fun bounce houses for kids of all ages. VERY friendly and professional staff!!!"}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience with my brother, his wife and their twin toddlers last night.  My husband and I also had fun because we are big kids sometimes.  If you want to see joy on your child's face, please go to Bouncy World.  Like the others have said, the price is great, the place is clean, the people are friendly.  It's a good place for family time.  I want to go there again and again.  THANKS, BOUNCY WORLD.  :-)"}
{"text":"Why can't I bring in my plastic water bottle? I totally get not being able to bring outside food, but a water bottle? They wanted me to pay $1.75 for a water cup. My kids were having fun and sweating and wanted water. We had to walk by the shoes to get a sip of water instead of sitting by the food or couches where people were drinking water or soft drinks out of their styrofoam cups. So much for helping the environment. I couldn't even have my empty water bottle out of my purse without getting talked to. The kids had fun bouncing and one of my kids liked the video games (although I could have had him do without for a few hours). The food was okay for a play place..not coming for the food. Used my pogo pass and probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great place to host a party for your child.  They are the BEST company out there as they have a private room and don't rush you thru the system so that they can get another party started.  They give you 3 hours in the private room (not the 90 minutes other places do).  AND . . when your time is up, you can spend the rest of the day in the other room.  My little one stayed another 2 hours after the 3 hour party!  The business is family owned and run extremely well.  Great people that work and run this place."}
{"text":"First of all, I'll start off by saying that with three kids, I frequently can be found at indoor playgrounds or jumper places. This place by far is the best in town. The have a wide variety of jumpers for all ages.  Very clean, which is great when your worried about your kids getting sick, which happens every time we go to other places. The owners and staff are great, really helpful, and actually care about what the customers want. I love the hours, other places do not have their amazing hours to exhaust our children!  Only thing I had negative to say is no coffee yet, which theynsaid they would work on. I don't mind having to buy everything there with the no outside food allowed, just more snacks need to be available. I would to love to have other snacks available besides popcorn while having a play date there. More variety of snacks for kids as well so they can play longer and not get dragged out!"}
{"text":"I had my sons birthday here in January! I had the best time and my son had an amazing experience.  (Sorry it's late but idk if my phone was acting up or what it barely let me write this review now lol) Anyways, the owner is freaking amazing! He kept checking on us to make sure everything was good! Him and my dad talked for awhile also, it was like we were all family celebrating   I was so nervous for this because other places I had a bad experience, but not here! My son still talks about his birthday to this day and how he wants to go back just to play!  Thank you for an amazing time"}
{"text":"What a great discovery. Great place for kids to play and meet friends. The staff is very polite and energetic. It's definitely a family owned business and run excellent. Comfortable area for parents to watch tv, use wifi etc. Only drawback is you can only wear socks inside and I'm grateful I haven't had to use the restrooms. Bring extra pair of comfy socks."}
{"text":"My son was invited to a birthday party at Bouncy World and upon arrival the person greeting us was extremely rude. I spoke to the owner's mom and she was very dissatisfied. She called her son, the owner, and took care of the problem right away. I originally was upset and thought I will never come here again; however, after watching the way these people run their business and take pride in what they do, I am actually thinking about doing my son's next birthday here. I will definitely be coming back. Businesses can't control what their employees do, but they can control how they handle it and they handled this right."}
{"text":"Great place for afternoon entertainment for the kiddos.  The place is clean and the staff is friendly (Mike, I appreciate you explaining your policies).  Prices for all day jump/play ($10 mon-thur and $12 fri-sun) and snack bar are reasonable. I enjoyed relaxing in the cozy area designated for parents. If your looking for a place where you can relax and you kiddos can have a blast- Bouncy World is the place!"}
{"text":"Took my son and nephews here (ages 5, 7, 9, 12) and they all had a blast! $12 per wristband for an unlimited amount of time, and only kids and adults who were jumping needed to be paid for! It is a \"socks only\" facility so be sure to have socks.   There was a toddler area for babies, a bunch of bounce house and slides, a gamer area with about 6 different consoles/TVs, and a big area for ball playing along with 2 basketball hoops! They also take care of the parents as well! There's a nice lounge and tv area with comfy couches and chairs and a few massage chairs (you pay for that separately). This place also has a full concession stand with food, drinks and snacks. Lots of seating and tables.    The staff was nice and friendly. A couple of the guys even shot some hoops with my boys as they made their rounds checking on everyone. My boys already want to go back!"}
{"text":"My kiddos had a great time, it was a bit of a drive for us but we came to use our Pogo pass. Bouncy world did not disappoint. My kids had a blast and the snack bar had good variety and reasonable prices. The staff was so friendly and accommodating. The facility was clean and well kept. If it wasn't such a drive from our house we would come a lot more often ;)"}
{"text":"This is a perfect place for lazy parents. I am a regular at a lot of different kid places. When my boys wanted to try Bounce World I was excited to bring them. They wanted me to pay full price to play with my kids which I think is steep. I have a 4 year old and essentially just chase after him the whole time. So to pay $12 each is to much. Especially because this place is pretty small. I will take Bounce U any day!!"}
{"text":"My kids love this place and always have a great time. That's why I felt compelled to sign in and dispute the B.S.  review posted by Ciprian a few days ago. I was there during his visit, watched his kids act like disrespectful jerks for a few hours unattended. As mentioned, he had no idea what went on inside because he was outside on the phone. EVERY member of the staff nicely warned this group about the rules, which fell on deaf ears. Those kids clearly don't respect authority, which was obviously something they learned at home. When they were finally kicked out at 7:30 (much to the relief of all the other families there) they tried to threaten the owner to either refund all of their money or they'd post a bad yelp review. This place is owned and run by good people, who I'll continue to support. Thank you Bouncy World."}
{"text":"We came here for a 5 year old's birthday party. I had never heard of it before so was eager to check it out. When we arrived we filled out a waiver and then put our shoes in a cubby in the front area and entered through the gate. My first thought was wow this place is very spacious. It has several different themed bounce houses, a toddler area, a video game station, air hockey etc. Hours worth of play for children. It has a sitting area and a snack bar. When it was time to eat, we went into the party room that had a gigantic inflatable chair and slide that the kids played on for most of the time. The food was good and the party ran smoothly. The kids had a blast and then knocked out in the car on the way home. Overall a great place to take the kids and/or to throw a birthday party."}
{"text":"Wish I could give less than one star! Staff was terrible! Lacked a female on staff and the males that where on staff where younger very rude and where not the type of people I would hire to work with kids. No smiles no greeting! They where all on their phones, and watching the basketball game on the tv. The staff was also very ethnic to say the least. On they way out I gave my children juice and slipped off my socks. Two of the staff members decided to tell the children directly they couldn't do that and told me to keep my socks on.. poor job all the way around. Henderson deserves better!"}
{"text":"Super fun! Meticulously clean. Attentive staff. Food is reasonably priced. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. Mike was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable when I asked him questions about birthday party packages. The whole staff here goes above and beyond to make sure your taken care of. I will definitely be coming back here in the future!!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place 10 stars!! This place is beyond amazing. The owners are the kindest people, catering to the parents and children at all times. The food is delicious. Love all the options they have. They have so many jumpers/bouncers for the kids to choose from. My kids have a blast here and we come all the way from summerlin. I also have to mention how CLEAN everything is.  Bring your kids here, you will not  regret it.  Thank you to the owners for opening such an amazing place for children and thank you for having the best customer service!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I took my grandchildren, ages four and six, to Bouncy World for the first time.  The place is big and seems clean and well-maintained.  On the negative side:  BW lacks variety--just lots of the same bouncy houses/slides--but with different exteriors.  The kids enjoyed themselves, but I didn't enjoy it because there were so few places for me to sit where I could observe the kids playing--and they don't allow outside food or drinks."}
{"text":"These guys are so awesome! Father and son owned and operated... $10 all day open jump & Tuesdays and Thursdays free balloon twisting and face painting... You can't beat it! The facility and all of the equipment inside are super clean and well-maintained... And everything on the menu is baked not fried! Chicken fingers were all white breast me so yummy... We will be back over and over and over again & we are definitely having our next birthday party here!"}
{"text":"We were there for the first time today. It was awesome. Bouncy World was about 10 minutes away from our home in Green Valley. We were greeted by cool staffs. The place was clean, prive was reasonable & if you're hungry, they have a snack corner/little cafe there. My 3 year old son enjoyed the bounce houses. And not forgetting My Mum & I. Lol!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. It's clean and there are many bouncy houses to choose from. My kids had so much fun. The owner was very polite! Would def come back!"}
{"text":"I had a great time here today,with my little ones. The staff were very professional and polite. They were very attentive to the kids and rotated to make sure there was supervision at all times. The facility was super clean and very spacious.  There were several bounce houses, some with obstacle courses, others with slides and one geared towards toddlers. In addition there was life sized connect four, air hockey,and several televisions set up for video games. There was something for each of my kids from ages 1 to 11 to do.  Today there complimentary face painting, and balloons being made( tips accepted and well deserved). My kids had a butterfly and sword which they loved. The artist was amazing very quick and very friendly.   I ordered a pizza and some wings which weren't bad. The pizza was cut up into multiple slices which worked well for my kids and some friends.  I appreciated that there was plenty of seating for me to take a break, also there were couches and televisions for parents and kids who weren't bouncing.  This was a greatest experience, I will definitely be returning and bringing friends here for play dates."}
{"text":"amazing establishment, everything is clean & well maintained . staff is always alert & checking on everybody, they play with the children , food is good for the kids everything is baked, unlimited play time , televisions for the parents to watch, more than anything the owners are respectful & humble ! this spot has now become a weekly spot for my family .."}
{"text":"Brought my 2yr old daughter on a calm Thursday evening and she had a blast! It was nice that there were only a handful of kids there because my baby was pretty much able to play without running into too many big kids. A few of the bounce houses were actually empty and we were able to jump around by ourselves. There's also a toddler area which is nice as well...has a bounce house with a ball pit, a medium size slide next to it, and a few little toddler toys in the area. There is one bounce house in the main area that could use a little attention. It's the Mickey Mouse bounce house and it has a little slide on the inside...however, the steps to get up the slide are a bit worn and way too slippery for kids to climb up without assistance. Other than that, everything was in good condition and the establishment was very clean. And after 2.5 hours of non-stop running, jumping, climbing...my baby still wasn't tired and cried when it was time to leave. So yes, we'll be back =)"}
{"text":"My son is loving our first visit!  Plus, seating with couches and free wifi for adults.  We didn't try the snack bar but there is an area for larger groups to sit and eat too.  Not sure the normal rate but we paid $10 for the day. Remember socks for your kids and yourself too!  $3 to purchase a pair of socks."}
{"text":"BRING YOUR OWN SOCKS!!!!!!  We had to buy 4 pairs of socks @ $3/pair.  Parents need socks even if you're not jumping.  The whole building is a NO SHOE zone--even in the parents area.  Great price and can't beat the all-day (come & go) wristband.  We will be back!  Very clean!  Staff is awesome as well"}
{"text":"I brought my nieces and nephew here before the long drive to California. We wanted to make sure they ran and jumped all their energy out so they would sleep during the car ride. This place is really cool. It is a safe place for the kids to run and jump around without worrying about them getting hurt. There is a lounge area for parents with TVs and couches. I saw some people with laptops open too. For less than $30, all three kids had a blast! But beware--everyone needs to have socks. I thought only the people bouncing needed socks. But if you want to go to the lounge area, bathroom, snack bar, etc., you need socks!"}
{"text":"I held a birthday party for my 3 year old son here this weekend and the service was absolutely horrible. When I booked the party I was told I would have an attendant to assist throughout the event and I could arrive 15 minutes early to prepare the room. On the day, they let me in 5 minutes before my party was scheduled to start so I was still setting up when my guests began arriving. My attendant didn't come in to talk to me until after guests arrived as well and was difficult to find throughout the party. The worst part was they tried to charge my guests for cups if they wanted a drink of water. As a party host with an open tab to take care of expenses, this was completely humiliating. They did nothing to keep guests who were not part of our party out of the room we paid for so we repeatedly had strangers in our room. I told the manager my concerns and she said she would make sure it didn't happen in the future, but did nothing to make up for my poor experience. The pluses were that the place is clean and the food was good. The kids at the party had fun, but it was not a good experience for the adults and that all could have been changed with a little customer service. This place is good for open play, but I do not recommend booking the party room."}
{"text":"This place was clean and well lit .the staff was friendly and my daughter and newphew had a blast will be back for sure"}
{"text":"The girl that works in front is super rude and clearly hates kids. Just has an attitude problem. This is also the second time she was rude to us and just on her phone the whole time. Never going there again or taking any family here. They also have holes all throughout the place in the jumpers which they refuse to patch up or replace. Where is this money going? Don't waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"My kids love this place. Great place To go during these hot months. Food is delicious and affordable and BAKED!!!"}
{"text":"Bunch of bounce houses, but this place is lacking variety. You can only bounce so long from one bounce house to the next and they are all pretty much the same. It was very hot when I first walked in, I had to ask them to turn on the air. But it did cool down after a while. They have a small section with tvs and video games hooked up to them, but no chairs to sit down. Not sure who wants to stand up playing video games for too long but ok.   Parents should not have to pay an admission fee to tend to their toddler, that's just ridiculous. And the no food or drink inside rule is fine, but water should be allowed.   The staff was very friendly, but overall my daughter seemed a little bored at times."}
{"text":"Had the grandson 3rd birthday party there a few weeks a go, it was very clean, polite staff, and the food was better than expected. would highly recommend. awesome time."}
{"text":"I don't know why anyone would give this place less then 5 stars! They just opened not to long ago so give them a break! The staff that works there are awesome! They are super friendly and made sure we were having a good time and everything was good with us. The place is very clean with no shoes on the carpet.. Socks are a must. If you don't have them they supply them for $3. It's $10 to get in and that's for an all day pass. They have a food bar with pizza, chicken fingers, hot dogs, etc.. They also do private parties but i didn't get prices on that. Overall my son had a great time and didn't want to leave. I would recommend this to everyone of all ages!"}
{"text":"I'll make it short and sweet........I wish we would've came here a long time ago with my child.  She's having so much fun and the environment is great and filled with fun and excitement.  I love the concept of all the bounce units in one spot and the kids are definitely safe.     Honestly if rather come here instead of go to the chuck place lol.  I met the owner and some of his family members and they are down to earth and genuine.    The price is great for the entertainment value.  I read a negative review about someone complaining about the price...that's nonsense!  You can't keep your child entertained anywhere for the price of admission here.    Bring your kids and kick back and watch them have fun and tired themselves out!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I was in for the first time today. The staff was very courteous, professional, and friendly! It is sad that a reviewer today gave this business one star because of policy. Different businesses may have different rules. Maybe Bouncy World's insurance carrier states no one on a bouncy house or slide because of liability. Think, someone comes down on a slide or an accident happens while someone without a waiver is on it. Who knows what an injured person would do after the fact. It is called protection on the business owner's part. I would call it a smart business practice.  I was in the other bouncy place and vowed years before I would not go in again. They charged me money for a teenager that never put a hand, foot, or any body part on any bouncy house. The employees were worthless with talking about and the owner never returned phone calls or emails. That is bad business practice. I would rather pay to be on it than not be on it. There's nothing standing to watch kids. Plus, that place is not well kept, clean, and have great food like Bouncy World. My kid wants to have a party there because she had so much fun. I would refer everybody to Bouncy World!!! Keep up what you are doing Bouncy World!!!"}
{"text":"horrible customer service today.  rude rude manager who thinks being a jerk to me is defending his employees after I was  grumpy that my pogo pass wouldn't work and it costs me 24$ to get in.  this will be my last option in play gym in Vegas after today. :("}
{"text":"staff is super friendly. I've been to so many bounce places and this one is so far my favorite. All day bounce and you can leave and come back.  Private party rooms. Football games were on! Love that!  My kids are 2 and 5 and they loved it.  Free air hockey. Basketball bounce house.m was my favorite.  I'd definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Saw this place driving down Stephanie and thought it looked fun for my nieces! Ended up taking them there! This place is awesome! New and very clean! The staff is super friendly and so personable! Definitely will be coming back! And you can't beat it for all day fun for only $10 wristbands"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from California. I brought my two toddlers here to play while my husband was attending a work conference so I needed something to do with the kids to kill time. The guys that work here are great! They are very attentive to the kids. They will stop and play with them and make sure all the parents are ok as well! The place is very clean and the bathrooms are even cleaner!!! Which is very important to me. The food was good and the prices are fair. What's even better.... there is Couch seating area and TV's for the adults perfectly situated where you can see the whole play area. I would definitely recommend this place to family and friends!"}
{"text":"The worst experience ever and very rude manager, an African American lady who started to yell at my 12 year old son and his friends, for made up reasons. At first she wanted to kick them out because they were \"unattended\" while I was outside the business speaking on the phone. The second time she said the kids were \"rough\" . She started to yell that she is the manager and her son is the owner, super rude attitude and no customer service at all. I always visit jumping and bouncing places in Vegas but I have never had such a bad experience anywhere else. Definitely never coming back and contacting the Better Business Bureau to file a complaint. A star is way too much of a rating for this place . Disappointing all the way around."}
{"text":"Clean fun place for kids... Staff are very nice and helpful... High quality bouncers and good place for parents to chill while kids are burning off cals"}
{"text":"Great place to bring the kids, wears mine out. 2 big t.v.s for adults and comfy seats."}
{"text":"Uber CLEAN and they're constantly sanitizing. Great little in-house concession/snack bar and they were nice enough to make a FRESH HOT pot of coffee for me. The inside is very spacious and has a lot of seats for parents to hang out and catch up on grown-up things or, just to take a load off. They even had a lady come by to do free face painting (tips are appreciated). Socks only. No barefeet. And ABSOLUTELU, no shoes. The walking area is carpeted throughout and the eating area is not. There are plenty of tables and chairs to accommodate people. It wasn't as crowded as most places, which I liked. Less casualties. Kids weren't running into one another and they have a separate little area with jumper and slide for the tiny tots, where bigger kids are not allowed. So, little kids won't get mowed down. I don't live anywhere near Henderson but, it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Great place! Clean!! The smoothies are so yummy, not too sweet. There's 2 separate lounging areas with couches & tv's for parents (Dad's) to relax & nap the wait away. Obstacles, slides & jumpers with an in house cafe making pizzas, chicken fingers, etc!! Seems to be family owned & operated which we love! Love supporting local business owners! Bring socks because no shoes are allowed passed the gate keeper....part of the reason it's nice & clean!!!"}
{"text":"Usually when my kids ask to go to BounceU or the other bounce places in the area I cringe...they all smell horrible and are dirty and nasty. Also, the other places don't have much for my younger daughter to do, I can't tell you how many times she's been scared by the bigger kids because they don't have separate areas. Bouncy World was awesome...super clean and well maintained with a great assortment of bounce houses and activities (they even have video games). I love that they have a huge bouncer just for younger kids that has a slide and balls too. The staff was so nice and they actually cared about the guests there. There's an area with food and TVs to have lunch if you get hungry which is great. I'm glad we have a bounce house place I actually enjoy going to now!"}
{"text":"I think this place is a good idea.  If my kids were slightly younger, I would be able to give it 5 stars.  The goods:   The price is amazing.  $12 for as long as they want to bounce.  Here is some comparisons for you: $10 for open bounce at Bounce U, limited to 2 hours, $26 for 90 minutes at Skyzone, and $20 for two hours at Gravady.  No question that Bouncy World is the best priced.  Location, location, location.  On Stephanie, just north of American Pacific in Henderson.  (Which is only slightly north of I215.)  For me, this is very close to my house.  Ample parking.  Food and beverage sales.  I didn't try the food, however, it makes this place more like CEC rather than the bounce/jump places.  You can come here, order a pizza, baked chicken strips, of just have some treats, while your kids bounce.  Even better?  Unlimited refills on drinks.  Adult comfort.  Three couches and a big screen TV.  There is just no comparison to the hard benches at Bounce U.  Also, ample comfortable chairs, even a few foot stools to kick your feet up.  Four video games on flat screens.  Not an arcade game, so no additional money involved.  Other than food, once you pay for your kid to get in, no more money out of pocket.  Advertised on their website is a parents night out all the time!  Four hours of babysitting for $25 per kid, kids 5-12.  I could see how useful this would have been when my kids were younger.  The only bad: this place is really geared to kids 3-8.  My 12 year old was giving me a lot of 'tude about being there.  Eventually, he relaxed and started playing tag with a couple of 5-8 year old boys.  Also, I saw a little boy practically sit in his lap as they were playing video games next to each other.  With a certified Red Cross/CPR/First Aid babysitter in my house, I don't need the parents night out.    I think that I will come back with my third grade Girl Scout Brownies and I think they will have a blast!"}
{"text":"Went today and was very upset with my experience. The toddler area kept getting overrun by rude teenagers and were hurting my 2 year old.. despite constantly asking staff to assist the kids just kept going in there.  Clearly the staff don't care about small children's safety. I will not be returning and will make sure I let anyone I know be aware of how awful this place is."}
{"text":"Before I came I called to check the hours and the open bounce and someone quickly answered and answered my questions. The parking was great not a lot of cars not a lot of traffic or people. I entered the building it was quickly greeted by the reception. Everybody has to take their shoes off including the parents and put them in cubbies. The entire facility was not crowded at all. The snacks are reasonably priced. Overall it was a great experience for $10 a child it's a great deal."}
{"text":"Just moved from Hawaii found place that my kids enjoy . Enjoyable place great food great staff . Best of all clean and safe for all ages.  Nice private room for parties .  And its family ohana so they believe in taking care of their facility."}
{"text":"Amazing place for kids, i also met the ceo/founder and he is ineed a great person. Try so hard to keep customers happy, they is reason why he has a 4.8 good review online he the king of bouncys! Good job!  will be back in the future!"}
{"text":"We had our grandsons 4th birthday party here today. We absolutely love this place, the staff and it's so clean! Thank you Bouncy World for helping us celebrate!"}
{"text":"I do not see why this place doesn't have top tier stars, the place is clean, especially the restrooms, food is well priced and customer service is great.  What parent wouldn't want to come relax here on their massage chairs while their children are having fun?"}
{"text":"So we're in Vegas and I have some work to do. Didn't want to go to one of the many arcades until the hubby gets out of work and the arcades aren't enclosed. So I yelled indoor playgrounds and came across Bouncy World. We got in and it's super clean!!! There are over 10 big bouncy castles and 4 gaming stations, tons of places to sit, a lounge area with big screens, and free wifi!!!!! And they serve really good food!!! We had baked chicken remders (yum), fries, 4 drinks, 3 go gurts, popcorn, and cotton candy for $28. You can get all your needs met here! The bathrooms are super clean and smell good too!! I'm very impressed with the overall ambiance and cleanliness of this place.  The reason why this place gets 5 starts is the great customer service. Everyone is mindful of the kids' safety, which I appreciate. My boys had a great time here. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Spacious, lots of bouncy houses, and games... for unlimited hours!! My kids (5and 6 yrs olds) come here and play for hours non-stop, no problem! And my husband and I just sit on a comfortable couch and watch tv or work on the stuff on pc while kids are having fun."}
{"text":"First visit. I have to say compared to other inflatable places in town it was more relaxed. I came here for a birthday party and I don't like how in some places you are rushed from one room to the next and then it's BYE! There is still a 3 hour time limit for birthday's but they let you bring in your own cake and run it time wise the way you want to which is the way it should be. The staff was very friendly and checked in from time to time, but were not pushy at all. The staff is also very playful with the kids while they are bouncing from place to place. I know that my kids appreciated that. I like that you can also rent bounce houses for your home from here too. They have a large connect four, air hockey and lots of fun inflatables. My kids had a blast and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place to anyone very clean great environment for kids and family!!!! Had a. Birthday party for my son this pass weekend,everyone had a great time and no stress at all, which my add is hard to believe at a child's birthday!!! Food is great pizza and chicken fingers served hot. Hostess for party was very friendly girl annalessa I think?! The thing I love most about this place it's family owned,and full of love this place will be blessed! Had the pleasure of meeting the owner mike and his mother great kind people,definitely will back."}
{"text":"It's been 2 years since I first wrote my review for Bouncy World and they still hold the high standards they did upon first opening. It is always clean and I always see the workers walking around cleaning off tables or cleaning the chairs and couches. I've seen the workers play with kids and console kids when they get hurt. I'm a preschool director so attentiveness and cleanliness are very important to me. Today we went again for a birthday party and my boys 4 and 5 never get tired of this place. The cool thing is the wristbands are good all day so we can take them home for a nap and go back after. Everyone is extremely friendly and the owner is always working hard and walking around greeting all his guest. I love that the owners are super hands on and is always available. This is absolutely one of our favorite places to take our kids."}
{"text":"Great place! This place is super clean and the owners are very friendly. Used to go to Bounce U but they have very limited hours. This place is open all day and once you pay, you have access all day so you can come and go as you please. There are plenty of bouncers to pick from and our kids had a great time. Would definitely recommend it and will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"The kids have fun here, they have about 10 different bounce houses, some with obstacle courses, some with Badketball hoops inside & slides, 4 tvs with videos games... A sitting area for the adults with tvs as well. EVERYONE must remove their shoes, cubbies are provided or lockers cost $3, socks are $3 if you don't have any.   The concession stand is the big downfall... A mediocre pizza, and fruit smoothies that were way too sweet. Before purchasing I asked if the smoothies were real fruit or had some type of fruit flavoring/syrup added too them. I was told real fruit and for close to $5 that's what I expect. I could tell right away they looked off & we're not real fruit. When the concession attendant came to ask us how everything was I told him the smoothies were way too sweet and where could j dump them.  He said in over a year this is his first complaint and walked off with an attitude. Then came back with the frozen individual packs from their supplier explaining they mix the pack with 5oz of water & boom! Smoothie time... Uhh no thanks... He still didn't take the sugary mess from us...   Other than that kids had fun, eat before coming, and remember your socks!"}
{"text":"As other have stated.    Staff if VERY RUDE.   Be careful booking a party.    We got over charged and false advertised.      They say you get a private waitress.    But you don't.    Very very very unorganized, what you pay for is NOT what you get."}
{"text":"Was visiting vegas from New Jersey and I absolutely loved this place! staff was wonderful very polite and professional. Prices were very fair on entrance and food and all the food made there is baked which was awesome!"}
{"text":"Overall this place is pretty child friendly. There was many different bounce house for kids of all ages.   The only 3 complaints that I do have are: 1) The staff can be overbearing with reminding you about the rules of the facility.  No outside drinks or food.  No moving the non stationary toys around.  2) The entrance. The convenience of the automatic entrance door is great, BUT it is right in front of the area where shoes and other items are dropped off. Unless you have your child on a leash or strapped to a stroller.. there's a chance that they could run out into the streets.   3) Party area. It's TIGHT! I think there should be ample room for the kids to push their chairs back without hitting the chair that is less than 6 inches apart. I have a 2 year old that still needs assistance and the tight area really makes it hard to assist her."}
{"text":"The only reason you would like this place is if your have never been to nice places and accept  less than quality"}
{"text":"We attended \"Pump it up\" for a birthday party a few months ago and my toddler was in love. I thought for sure there was nothing better on this planet to get his energy out and make him that happy. Then we found this place.  A few friends of mine actually drove by and decided to take their little ones (all under the age of 3) the kids loved it so much - they were there for 4 hours!   We decided to skip bedtime and headed in around 8pm (they closed at 10pm). The minute my little guy walked in he knew where he was and he went bananas.  Owner, Mike, extremely friendly and eager to please his guests. This is a family owned establishment and it shows. Super clean, lots of variety (video game consoles, leather chairs to lounge while kids run amuck, life sized games). They even have a small concession area where you can order items like pizza, chicken fingers, fried fish, small snacks for kiddos, Etc and it's not ridiculously priced!   ***important tip*****  Bring socks, but if you do rush out the door like me and show up in sandals, they have nice pairs for $3 a pair and they have munchkin sizes too ;)   We'll be bringing the boys back next weekend."}
{"text":"I love that the owner is out here working and making sure everything is A-OK. Very friendly staff and owner. I especially liked that they don't price gouge their food prices. Family environment, clean atmosphere, clean bathrooms. Lounge area for families to wait as their kids play. Workers were respectful and nice. My kids enjoyed themselves. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My girls LOVE IT here .. and so do I. The staff is friendly and helpful especially Mike, and the equipment is fun and safe. We have a blast EVERY TIME we go, and although the staff is always inviting - some of the parents we come across can be more rude than their children. All in all, when you're surrounded w/the right people, this great staff, and it's playful environment -- you'll have the best time, guaranteed. Chicken fingers and fries are great and the bathroom's are always clean witch is a huge plus when you have children. Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The girl who greeted us and \"helped\" us check in was not friendly at all and had an annoyed look about her. We liked the place but the staff was really lacking."}
{"text":"I been in that place few times and every time I'm there they have new rule. 1.- no food from outside not even water , if you brought a bottle water you have to keep it outside. 2.- no playing with balls on one of halls, manager said is because they have tables next to the hall and they don't want no one be hurt (maybe they can move those tables to a different place or maybe no more balls inside the place) etc etc...  not coming back to that place!"}
{"text":"I wasn't very impressed with this place and neither was my 10 year old daughter. They have around 15 bouncy houses and a place where you can shoot basketball and that's about it. The mood of this place is chaotic.  We ordered a hot dog and some drinks from the dining area they have. My daughter took a few bites and we threw it away. It was rubbery. I saw a pizza come out and it didn't look very impressive. You can't bring water or any other drinks into Bouncy World so you will have to buy water or soda at the dining area.   I think this place would be better for younger children, maybe 3-8 but any older and I think they would get bored. My daughter wanted to have her face painted but the line was 10 kids long and we watched as she ate her rubbery hot dog and the line didn't move very fast.   We gave it a shot and it didn't work. Lastly, whoever the Manager of this place maybe try to hire some people who like kids and know how to smile."}
{"text":"Bouncy world has been the most comfortable, trustworthy place that I have taken my children to. The staff has never been anything but welcoming and awesome with my kids. I always leave relaxed and my kids tired from play. Anyone looking to get v there kids out of the house for an affordable price should go here."}
{"text":"My son had seen this place when we're driving by so when I told them they could pick any place too go today, they decided Bouncy World was it. We usually Go too Bounce U and its fine but this new place was awesome. It's obvious it's a family ran place which for me speaks leaps and bounds. I really like too patronize businesses like that. Everyone was really courteous and polite. The place was spotlessly clean (I realize it's new but it's still a huge plus). The kids decided too eat here and we ordered a large pizza and large French fries. The food came out piping hot and fresh!! Yummy! Drinks offered free refills which is a huge plus and Prices are very reasonable. The $12 entry fee (bracelet) comes with unlimited play for the day. I heard that they are working on a lounge area for the adults which will be coming in the future!!!  Yea!! A must try for all parents around here that have kids. We will be back."}
{"text":"My 3 year old son had a blast. We grabbed some bites to eat and he went right back to playing. He loved exploring the various bounce houses and slides.  We will definitely be back. Great prices too."}
{"text":"basically a warehouse full of big bounce houses.  I won't be spending my money here in the future.  No outside food or drink, which is fine.  I purchased a bottle of water for the same price as a fountain drink and they wanted to charge me additionally for a cup to pour my purchased water in.  That was such a poor customer service move I will be taking my children to other indoor play facilities in the area."}
{"text":"Well we brought our 2 year old son here to celebrate his 3rd birthday, although we didn't have a party after visiting this place we don't plan on ever returning...they said no outside food or WATER! Hello we live in the desert ! No food (that's understandable) but for a place with ONLY swamp coolers and fans to keep people cool you should be allowed to bring in water to stay hydrated! (Needless to say I snuck in water anyway because that's a BS rule) Even when my husband was holding a kids water bottle he was questioned by staff \"what is that and who is it for?\" He told the guy it was water for our son.. so he reluctantly said okay.. but I mean come on really? I paid $12 each for myself and my husband and I didn't even play with my son I just watched! Also we felt for the limited number of things to do inside $12 was too much money to charge people. Next time maybe tell your staff to focus more on keeping the children safe instead of trying to be the water police! It was unbearably hot inside even if you aren't jumping around. Needless to say we only stayed an hour. think we will stick with Kangamoo! Much better facility! (No outside water) SIMPLE rule huh? Well maybe if you like to be dehydrated in the desert... same complaint in reviews before mine glad I am NOT alone"}
{"text":"While on the hunt for the next birthday spot, we came across Bouncy World.  We brought my niece to check it out, and her previous choice went out the window! She wanted it here.   After walking around to check it out, the details were explained to us. You are charged based upon how many people JUMP in the bounce houses. People can attend, but if they are going to participate in the jumping, you will be charged for them. How do they determine who is a jumper and who is not? Wristbands! Also based on how many people you have is how much food your party gets. You can always order more, at an additional cost, like we did, but the food that came out was enough for 15 jumpers and their parent(s). It was a reasonable package considering the amount of food you get and the party was 3 hours, opposed to 2 at other places. We only ordered more food because the adults wanted more.   There is a separate, private room for parties. In there is another slide and an extremely huge, inflatable chair. Luckily we were able to book the private room. and it was great. You are allowed to come in 15 min before the start of your party to set up. We were rushing in because we had issues with the cake, but staff were willing to offer a hand in setting things up. We didn't have much to do though. Then they came in with the drinks and the food a bit later.  There are enough tables to setup for cake, gifts, and food. Plus seating for guests.   In the main room are various bounce houses, air hockey, and video games. Should you not want a private room, there are several tables and chairs in the main room you can hold your party.  You also MUST wear socks past the gates. They will not let you wear your shoes on the floor. You also are not able to bring in your own drinks. Not even water bottles. They sell water, though so don't worry about becoming parched after jumping around.   At the end of the party, parents kept saying they will be bringing their children back to jump. They had such a good time there, and were pleased with the staff and CLEANLINESS of the facility. Very clean and in order. Customer service was on point with all the staff as well.   That night my niece knocked out, fast. Which means she definitely had a great time!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time coming here. My boyfriend and his daughter has been here a few times. We were greeted by Mike and he is super friendly. Love the idea of this and how much space there is for all the kids the run around. I like how the staff and owner walks around to see how everyone is doing and if they are having a fun time. I highly recommend this place. Remember to bring socks!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential  but needs a lot of work. 1.  Price is reasonable but charging for parents is a little ridiculous, especially if you have a toddler you are trying to keep an eye on. 2.  The food is gross.  the pizza crust tastes like a saltine cracker and the cheese isn't real cheese 3.  No healthy options, and when I asked about this the owners comment was 'we carry baked fish sticks!'  Seriously?!?  Barf 4.  They refused to let me bring in water and charged me $2 for a cup to fill at the water fountain 5.  The place is cold and dark.  Apparently the owner is too cheap to turn on lights and heat.  I hate to see what it's like in the summer 6.  The place is super clean and the staff is extremely friendly.    Like I said, this place has potential and under different ownership/ management, I'm sure it will sky rocket."}
{"text":"I received another bounce house birthday invitation. Ugh! Two hours of being stuck in dimly lit rooms with no natural light, sitting on narrow, hard metal benches. Then after 30 minutes shuffled into another room for 30 minutes. Inevitably some of the bouncy attractions are down for maintenance. I think they keep it dark so you can't see how dirty the place is. Then you are shuffled like cattle into another crowded room with uncomfortable cafeteria like tables to eat pizza, soda and cake. Then I hope that the 20 min car ride is long enough for the same stupid gift bag we get every single time, to bore my son enough that I can throw away all the little pieces of toys and trash when we get home. I hate it. I hate everything about it. My kid doesn't care because he gets to play with friends for two hours and eat/drink junk food.   I notice the name on the invitation is a little different than usual...Bouncy World. I think, that's not right. The address is Stephanie Street so maybe the place got a new name. I RSVP that we are attending and dread the pending day.   The day arrives. I ask Siri for directions just to make sure I go to the right place. She takes me to the wrong side of Stephanie. No problem. The correct address is only a few blocks in the opposite direction. I pull up and immediately can see that this is not like any other Bounce House party I've been to.  - First off, there are Windows! Lots of them. And skylights!  - The bounce houses are almost all out in the bright open space. A few are in a bright, big side room used for parties. They could use a little more space between the party tables, but I'm so happy with the place I'm not complaining. - All that light shows how immaculately clean the place is! - Free Wi-Fi! It's like angels are singing when I hear that. Finally! I can keep myself entertained for two hours without running up a data bill! - and the seats for parents! Leather sofas and chairs. No more back and leg pain from metal benches. - My only complaint is that there are no outlets near the sofas to charge my devices, but I'll bring an extension cord next time....problem solved!  Oh yes. There will most definitely be a next time...and not a Birthday Party invitation next time. For $12 my son can bounce all day! I will definitely be back for that price!  I could not believe that I was dreading spending 2 hours at a bounce house party and then ended up staying 6 hours! Unlike the other places that has a stop watch on the bouncy party, this place lets the kids stay and bounce as long as they want after the party ends at no additional cost. My son bounced until they closed at 8.   This is a definite new favorite place to take my son and his friends on a too hot, or too windy, or too cold day when going to a park is just too miserable.  I should also mention that I spoke with the owner and was extremely impressed with his market research to come up with a truly unique and pleasant indoor bounce house experience in a town that has way too many crappy, horrible indoor bounce house companies. Great job! I'm telling all my son's friend's parents about this place!"}
{"text":"Had my sons 2nd birthday here in December and it was great! Our party ended up a little larger than expected and they were very accommodating. All 50+ of our guests had only great things to say. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"On a recent family trip to the Vegas/Henderson area, I needed a place to take my five-year-old and two-year-old so they could let out a bunch of energy. I'm so grateful we found bouncy world. The price of admission is perfect, especially when you consider it's an all day admission and you can go in and out as you need to.  I also like that they have a very nice selection of bouncy play structures, including a specific area for younger children.  As for adults, there is ample seating and Wi-Fi available.  The only part that I did not really like was the price of the caf√© food. I understand it's one of the ways they make significant profit, so the prices being a little high makes sense. However, it did sting a little to pay such a mark up for things like popcorn and fries.  Overall, this place is pretty solid. We will definitely be coming back the next time we visit the area."}
{"text":"My 3 children and I along with my good friend and her 7 children came to Bouncy World for the first time and used our POGO Pass to get in. At first I really thought it was going to be boring quickly afterwards but we were there for 2 hours and could have lasted longer possibly had we come earlier in the day.  The inflatables we well maintained and the area was clean. Everyone who enters MUST wear socks so either wear them, bring them or buy a pair for $3. The snack bar looked like it had plenty to offer even though we did not try anything they offered. I did see a pizza come out to a table and it looked ok.  The thing that impressed me the most... the way that the staff interacted with the children.  I saw the young men playing with and encouraging the children.  In other places like this that I have been to the staff seems irritated with the children but NOT HERE! I made sure to get the employees names because quite honestly good employees/ managers can make or break a place and judging off what I saw, Bouncy World should be doing very well for themselves.  Thank you to Tyler & Mike, who I believe are managers, and to \"Ant\" for playing with the children and to Isabella for making a great friendly and safe play environment for the children."}
{"text":"Great place to bring the kids super clean and friendly staff!! They have about 5-6 jump houses and slides along with video games and basketball court.. parents can watch tv while the kids are playing and everything is open so u can see what there doing."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and like this place. It's very clean and my kids love it. A good place to take ur kids for playtime. However as far as private party, not the best experience. I was very disappointed. First of when i walked in I didn't feel welcome, my guest also mentioned the bad attitudes they experience with the girls up front. I was there 20 mins after I had arrive waiting for an attendant to walk me through the plan of the party, but no one. So I finally came up to ask when will the food arrived and then to be told \"we don't start anything until you pay.\" Wow, I have hosted parties at places like pump it up, kangomoo and Chuck E. Cheese and was never told that. These places we had an attendant assist us from the beginning to the end which made the experience stress free and we paid at the end. Not here, u had to pay up first. The girls made me feel I was a bother to them when I had questions or an issues. I felt they were getting more business out of me then me getting a friendly customer service that was there to help my guest and I have a good time. They told me I couldn't bring any outside containers when I asked about bringing in food or water bottles in the beginning. Ok I get that, some places are like that. But with the package we paid for only came with the cups for the kids that's was included. So I asked for more cups for the adults. The AC was broken that day, they had fans on every where, and it was a hit day so I wanted to make sure my guest stayed hydrated. So to get cups they were charging $1.29 (approx I can't remember) for 1 cup each. So I asked if I can jus buy my own, they said no we had to purchase their cups which is part of their policy, the \"no outside containers.\" Didn't think cups were part of that policy, I thought it's was only regarding food due to infection control. So that def racked up the cost. I had pulled one attendant to the side politely expressing the experience I was having & just bad vibes I'm getting from staff and her responds is I'm sorry we are jus under staff. Well I did pay for this private party and I may add it was not cheap for what we got out of it. Again it's a great place to take your kids to play but not a good place for private party. Don't do any private party here, I feel You can get a better experience at other places like pump it up, kangamoo etc."}
{"text":"This isn't just another bouncy place. And I wouldn't just say that. I've recently had my kids birthday party here and I would recommend all family and friends to do the same. Not only can you just stop by for the day at such a reasonable price but yes birthday parties too. I love that it is family owned and ran. I love their kindness cleanliness of the place and attentiveness. If you haven't been GO."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that horrible review is ridiculous. This place was AMAZING from the moment my fianc√© & I walked in to check it out.   Our boys are 5yrs apart in age, his son being 8 while mine just turned 3, today. So finding fun indoor things for them both to enjoy is darn near impossible.  They both have a LOT of energy so this place was perfect! My fianc√© & I even got in on the bouncing!   With admission as well as dinner there we spent MUCH less than at chuckecheese plus it is much much MUCH cleaner. Our boys had a blast from beginning to end. And we were there for 3hrs!   Their food is baked, not fried, which is a total plus in our book. I didn't get to see much of the kitchen or menu, my fianc√© took care of dinner while I was running around with our toddler. But what we ordered and ate, was delicious! We had a large pizza, hotdog, chicken fingers & fries as well as 4 drinks. Free refills too!   Every member of the staff was super friendly. And they seem to always be smiling. They checked in with us, numerous times, to make sure we were all having fun. It was nice to actually be spoken to and treated with respect unlike many other indoor play grounds where the owner/staff treat you more like an inconvenience rather than a paying customer. I felt like they were actually excited to have us there. Our 8yr old even played tag with one of them while our 3yr old insisted another jump with him. Lol.   All in all our entire family loved this place. We will DEFINITELY be returning & recommending it to all of our friends."}
{"text":"My sister had a birthday today. She bought the 20 wrist band package for $440. From what I experienced I did not like. The wrist bands were for the kids, my fianc√© and I received wrist bands each as well as our daughter (11months old). They said we counted as one admission. One of our other party guests came in with her two kids and husband and was told the parents had to buy their own wrist bands if they wanted to bounce with their kids or take a wrist band from one of her kids (5yrs & 2yrs). Then when she brought up the point of wanting to be there for her youngest on the bounce houses they told her the 5yr old can watch him. I really believe that for the kids who are 2 & under the parent should get that wrist band so they can be there with their kid.   Second thing I didn't like was, we had a party host who knew what time our party starred & the first 45 minutes she was on her lunch. I've been a party host before I find that unprofessional especially knowing you have a party to host at such time.   The last thing I didn't like was that we had to pay for extra cups for the adults to be able to drink from. Those should be included with the package or at least one adult cup for each kid cup.  Honestly I just thought it wasn't run well & would not recommend friends to do parties there."}
{"text":"Well, since it's new the place is very clean and smells clean. The staff are also really nice."}
{"text":"Super fun place. My kids were amazed by all the jumpers. Staff was really friendly. It is a little plain, not too much going on as far as decor. Don't forget your socks.... parents have to have socks on just to supervise their kids. Thankfully they sell them, so I grabbed a pair for $3. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Unlimited bouncing for a low price. It's clean and open. There's a seating area for parents with couches and free wifi. Make sure you bring socks even if you aren't jumping. The concession stand is affordable and clean. Definitely bringing my littles here again and again."}
{"text":"This is our first time here and we are very impressed.  It is super clean and a watchful staff is everywhere.  The concession stand offers baked fries and chicken nuggets. Glad we stopped in."}
{"text":"The place is really good! Big space and very clean, the staff is nice and polite, they made sure we are having a good time, the food is very good and fast, the bouncers are big enough for the kids can play with out getting hurt ,also the place is very safe. I will recommend this place, definitely I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Today we had a birthday party for my granddaughter at Bouncy World.  This is our third or fourth visit here.  We've been to the other places as well, and Bouncy world is the best by far!  It's family owned and run.  The food is very good and the service is top notch (and I teach customer service for a living).  You're not pressured for time like the other places and they cater to your every need and want.  If you're going to take your kids to one of these places, take them here."}
{"text":"This place is very clean. I like that they serve food and parents if we chose not to jump there is a place for us to sit in comfortable couches. The staff is amazing, very friendly, and always checking in to make sure you are good. Also like that the staff does at times play with the kids. Can't beat the price either."}
{"text":"This was my second time here in the last 6 months. Everyone is so friendly. The establishment is clean and very organized. Thank you for the great treatment we experienced with your company."}
{"text":"I am SHOCKED at how well-reviewed this place is. I came here for a birthday party in the private party room, and I couldn't believe the poor service was. First of all, I do NOT like being nickel-and-dimed. You are not allowed to bring your own water bottles in, but they CHARGE YOU $1.65 FOR A STYROFOAM WATER CUP. Seriously?!? How dare you not allow parents to bring in water, a basic human necessity, for themselves and their kids, and then charge them to drink water in your facility. You should be ashamed of yourselves! When I complained about this rule, the complacent staff were rude and apathetic. Oh, and that water that you're charging us to drink? Tastes like unfiltered trash.   My friend, the party host, was told she couldn't bring juice boxes in the room for kids at her PRIVATE PARTY. She was also charged $1.65 per water cup for adults.   My husband went to ask for a plastic knife to cut my son's pizza. The employee said, \"Oh, and since you're going back there, could you bring these, too?\" and handed him 3 more knives. After the fact, he wished he would have told her no, that if she wants something delivered to the party room, she should do her job and take it there herself.   From my understanding, they charge parents to come in with their kids, even if all they're doing is going on the equipment to look after them.   I live in this community, have kids of my own, and I belong to some mommy-and-me groups. Also, I work with young kids and their parents in this community. I will be absolutely sure to spread the word about this place, their cheapskate owners, and their irresponsible, complacent staff. There are a lot of choices for child entertainment in this town, Bouncy World... how about being a nice neighbor so you remain one of them?"}
{"text":"My niece had her sons birthday party here and everything was great.  The kids had so much fun.  Lots of things for them to do.  The price for the birthday package was very reasonable.  The staff was great and very interactive with the kids.  Once our 3 hours were up, we left the party area but the kids could have stayed and bounced all day.  We will definitely be coming back to Bouncy World."}
{"text":"We saw Bouncy World on groupon and thought it would be a nice place to take the kids to burn off some energy. It is a very nice clean facility but boy do the workers POLICE you. My husband was asked if he had a wrist band numerous times and followed by the \"staff\". Also, It seems like every time we turned around they were telling us something was wrong. (You can't have a closed water bottle?) but if I bought a bottle of water from the establishement it wouldn't be an issue? My son can't touch the air hockey table or pucks because he will scratch it?   We won't return due to those issues. I hope management reads reviews and tells their staff to tone it down and let people ENJOY themselves. It's a damper to PAY to get in somewhere and be watched in a daycare center atmosphere as an ADULT."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm impressed how immaculately clean it is.   Many varieties of different jumpers fit for different ages.   Will definitely recommend this place and coming back"}
{"text":"Indoor establishment with about a dozen or so inflatable bouncy houses, ranging from small to big.  The place is clean , well ventilated , comfortable Temps and spacious. They have a dining area with pizza and snacks. The prize is very reasonable ($10-12).  They also have about 4 TVs hooked up to game consoles. I believe they do birthday parties (saw another area with more inflatable bouncy houses but didn't check it out )  My 5 year had a blast. We went on a Saturday and the crowd wasn't too bad.   All in all, great place for kids to have fun and burn off some energy. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Great staff! Clean environment and a ton to do. It never feels crowded even when there's a party going on. I like that there are staff walking around and maintaining the facility. A lot of food choices that are baked. Would love to see fruit options and maybe some healthier snack options. Other than that... Fantastic place to bring your kids at any age.   My husband and my 2 year old son came out to $12 total. Great price.   Will consider doing a birthday party here."}
{"text":"Very large, open space for kids to run around and play. There are about 10 jumpers, two air hockey tables and 4 game consoles with TV. You can also purchase food from the small take out counter, pizza seems to be the popular choice. There is a private party room as well. Bathrooms are super clean and well lit as well as the entire place. For $10 a kid, they can jump/play as long as they desire. There is also a sitting area for parents with two large flatscreen TVs. I noticed they had wifi available but did not try it.  Having visited many of these kids places around town, this is honestly one of the best I have seen. The only one I would rate higher would be sky zone as it is geared toward kids a little higher in age then this place.   Believe it or not, my 10 year old found this place on Yelp and asked me if we could go! So their social media marketing is obviously working well!  Definitely check it out of you have kids 10 or under, they will have fun and you will be happy that they did. And the best part about coming here is that you are supporting a minority owed local business."}
{"text":"Came here with my sister, neice (3) and my kids (3 & 7months) we paid for everyone except my 7 mo because obviously she doesn't jump. But when we were in the play area I went in one of the jumps with my baby and was told I had to sign a waiver for the baby too. Which is fine but then they asked me to pay for her. So I decided not to I just kept my baby off the jumpers. And my sister and I had to take turn playing with our kids. Very disappointed.  Wish we would have gone to a different play place that only charges for kids who can walk. Sadly we won't be back."}
{"text":"I love visiting places when they first open because it's soo clean.   That's the first thing I noticed.  Haha  Ok image a bunch of various jumpers crammed into one place and you have Bouncy World.  Indoor jumping houses for all ages, yes us big kids can jump too!!!  I'm not sure why there are not any pictures so I posted a bunch for you guys to see :)  Right now I'm injured so I wasn't able to jump with my kid, but they have plenty of places for you to sit and watch the tv or enjoy some snacks while your kids play.  Also Free Wi-fi !!!   Note: Everyone MUST wear socks, whether you plan on jumping or not.  Since I never wear socks with my sandals I had to purchase socks for $3.    No outside food or drinks allowed but the food/snacks are all reasonably priced compared to other places.   The owner Mike is super personable and great, checking on everyone making sure they're having a great time.   I definitely felt comfortable letting my kid run around in this area.  There is a small section of video games too so everyone can play in-between jumping.  You can also order your own party room, check the website for details.  Open 7 days a week, $10-12 bucks for each child and unlimited jumping ... you can't beat that price !!!    Thanks Bouncy World my kid had a great time, definitely we will be back and we are bringing others too !!!"}
{"text":"Staff is great, very helpful and friendly. All play areas are very clean. They have a great toddler section for kids 4 and younger.  Very affordable and a fun way for kids to get exercise with air conditioning!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I love this place! It's hard finding a nice clean indoor play spot for a toddler but this one was exactly what we were looking for. I love that there is no age limit so her and I can play together. I haven't had the food yet but they have a nice menu, definitely going to try it in the near future."}
{"text":"I went here for my friend's son's birthday party, and she was already telling me how strict they were with supplies. She was not allowed to bring her own food, plates, and cups, even though they're so stingy with the supplies. The plates they provided were even flimsy and the pizza was nothing special. The employers didn't look happy to be there either, and they were pretty snotty. They very strict with socks, by the way. When cutting the cake and passing them at, the workers were in charge and didn't even wear gloves. We pointed out that they should wash their hands, and all they did was apply hand sanitizer. The only good thing about the place is that it's big and there are plenty of inflatable obstacles for the kids to enjoy. Overall, I didn't like my experience here, and I wouldn't want to come back."}
{"text":"We just had our son's first birthday party here and the experience was amazing!!! We rented the private room from 6pm-9pm which included a whole bunch of seating, tables, a bouncy house, a gigantic slide that was super fast and steep, a bug blow up throne and of course a 60in TV so we could catch the Warriors win game 2.  They are strict about the socks only policy so we were able to let our one year old crawl around without worrying about how dirty the floor would be. All the bouncy houses were clean and well maintained. They had video games, air hockey tables, and basketball hoop bouncies so it's great for ages 1-teenagers.  Best part was this is a family owned establishment that is ran by the nicest people. Mike at the front was a great check in person. My party came in at different times and he made sure they all got their wristbands and knew were to go upon arrival. Doe, his grandma, was our host and she truly was the sweetest person! I'm not that experienced in the whole kid party thing and had no clue on getting the right amount of cups and food but she took care of it all.  The pizza and chicken fingers were the bomb.com!!!!! At first I was disappointed that I couldn't cater food, but was pleasantly surprised by how yummy the food they provided was. We got to bring our own cake and fruit trays so we had more than enough food.  I highly recommend BouncyWorld for parties that have a ton of kids with a variety of age ranges. Since we had the late slot, we got to stay until 9pm and they weren't pushy about getting us out of there nor did they stick a mandatory gratuity on the bill. I can go on and on a gush about them. Believe the hype. They have great reviews for a reason."}
{"text":"I love this place! We had our god daughters 5 birthday here and it couldnt have been a better choice.  First the staff. They are hands down the best we have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. They are very hands on and willing to help and make the experience the best as possible. They are also very open to making your party fun!!  We were even able to do games of musical chairs.  We have been to many places in the south side of town and Bouncy World is hands down worth the money.  We will be back for day paly dates."}
{"text":"1st and last visit.  Brought kids for small birthday gathering which included a 2 yr old.  Charged for her but then we got in trouble for helping her get on and off bouncy houses and slides.  Told an adult needed to pay to get on the bouncy items.  Upon inquiring more we found out 2 and under is supposed to be free.  So we just took the extra wrist band but thought policy of not being able to assist a 2 yr old was silly and greedy.    Brought a water bottle which we were told we could not use.  We would either need to buy a bottle or cup from concession stand and drink their water.  We offered to pour out our water and refill with drinking fountain but manager argued with us that we are not allowed to do that.  Kinda made a big deal over nothing b/c they wanted to try and squeeze an extra couple bucks from us to use their bottle instead of our spill proof one for our child.  Had a discussion with manager and frankly she doesnt understand business at all.   Going to drive away customers paying full price to try and make an extra couple bucks.  Not impressed at all.... wont be back and do not like giving money to poorly run businesses so i will support other local businesses instead.  Hope u do the same"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a place that I can take my one year old. Bouncy World was perfect! Great for all ages and the customer service is guaranteed 10 out of five stars. Very professional yet you can feel the family atmosphere they bring to the job. Not to mention, the food there is under rated! Best pizza I've had at any kids venue or any snack bar for that matter. It's also nice to have a nice venue on the south-east side of Vegas. I'll be bringing my kid here for a long time."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful in every way, they really thought of everything to make this place great! It blows other bounce places out of the water! Its a new family favorite, i booked my daughter's birthday party asap! Love it here!!! They even have free face painting!!!"}
{"text":"What: I like this indoor play place! I mean, how many other options do we have people! It's clean, there is a very comfortable parent area with couches and a TV usually on HGTV, bathrooms, water fountain, two play areas (large for bigger kids, small area for smaller kids) and a snack bar with everything on one floor.  Issues: Yes, EVERYONE must wear socks and yes, you CANNOT bring in any food or water, including your own personal water bottle.  The sock thing keeps everything clean and is understandable. I do take issue with the no personal water bottles. This is the DESERT, so it's just super lame, hence the deduction of one star. As a business, I really don't think it would affect their snack bar sales if they let people bring in personal water bottles, since they have a water fountain. So what is the difference? Instead, it just pisses everyone off = not great for business.  Service: Friendly workers check you in. Glad they accept CC as I was caught with no cash!  Price: For $10 M-TH it can't be beat! Remains on my list of places to go on a hot day!"}
{"text":"We were looking for an \"indoor playground\" and came up with Bouncy World. Our usual Giggles andTots closed at 7pm, while this place opens until 10pm. It has a great array of bouncy activities featuring your typical slides and bounce houses. However, my 2 yo really enjoyed the obstacle courses made for toddlers and a separate one for bigger kids. My 2yo was free with an adult admission. Even if you're not planning on jumping, everyone needs socks in the carpeted areas. Was told they have been open for about 10 months. Comments regarding other reviewers experiences: -staff phenomenally friendly. Not one person was rude to me at all. Actually, they were super friendly and multiple people checked to see how I was doing and made sure I enjoyed my smoothie. -cleanliness: far superior. I had 2 people come wipe my table to ensure it was clean. Bathroom very clean with someone coming in to wipe the counters while I was there. -no outside food/drinks. I think that this is quite reasonable given the fact they have their own concession stand. All cooked items are baked and kids snacks are good price at $1 each. I didn't feel like they were gauging me, but just trying to be a successful business. I only tried their mango smoothie, so unsure about quality of other food. It wasn't great, but it could have been the flavor I chose.  -lounge area: plenty of chairs and couches with decent amount of outlets to charge your phone. Also happy they have wifi available  Cons: light is a bit \"warehouse-ish\". Not great for photos, but definitely enough to see well. No military discount, but many places don't have this as well.  Overall, for $12, it was a great way to spend time and get the lil one tired so she could pass out on the car ride home. If you're on the fence, just give it a try!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out because of family recommendations. Once we got there my son was super excited. Very clean with a lot of room. Staff and owner was very friendly and helpeful. Because of the great experience I ended up reserving the private room for my son's birthday party. They also have multiple ps4 console available to use if you want to take a break from bouncing. From my understanding the private area is 3hrs long and after your party is over you don't have to leave just have to re shift. The rist band is an all day pass. You can leave as you please and return the same day to play some more. Will do a later review after my sons birthday party."}
{"text":"I am so extremely upset with this business I don't know how they are going to keep customers if they continue to treat customers the way I was treated today.  We purchased a POGO pass via Groupon and refused to allow my children to play because \"they can only play if you purchase an adult pass\" I had zero need to play simple was accompanying my 6 and 9 year old.   I offered to wait in the lobby while they jumped and played; still my children were denied access.   So I was forced to pay when we had already purchased passes just to allow my children to play.  I sat in a chair supervising my kids while their staff were repeatedly checking their cell phone and jokes among each other paying no attention to the children play or safety hazards.  Completely unprofessional customer service and rude staff member. I will not return to this place ever again and I will tell my friends and family of the terrible experience we had at TJ this place."}
{"text":"My angel loves this place. It's clean and reasonable. The staff has always been nice. They have TVs, food, chairs to chill when you are watching the kids play. Or you can jump and slide yourself."}
{"text":"Had a birthday party here tonight and the staff was awesome. They constantly checked on our party to make sure we had everything we needed. Everyone was so polite and this place is always so clean too. I know our guests enjoyed themselves and will definitely be booking more parties here."}
{"text":"This is a great place to kill time. Clean and friendly environment. The owners are very nice people. TVs for adults, Private Rooms for parties, snack bar and etc. Great facility!!"}
{"text":"My mom had the POGO pass that we used here today. We didn't have any issues with using it.   When you walk in there are cubbies to place your shoes. Everyone needs to use socks only regardless if you're jumping or not.   There's a separate area for toddlers ages 4 and under. It had 2 bouncy things including a slide.  The bigger area has 8 including a big slide. There were also 2 basketball hoops, a little arcade area and a video game area.   There's a lounge area for adults to sit and a dining place, as well.  The establishment seems cleaner than another we had visited before. The bathrooms were decent considering it's spring break and quite a bit of people here.   It's a bit of a drive from where we live, so probably won't frequent often. We would like to bring the kids again sometime though."}
{"text":"Went for my nephews birthday! He just turned 4 and he had SOOOO much fun there! Him and his 3 year old brother LOVED it!!! We were chasing them from bounce house to bounce house all night lol  We went on a Friday night and it wasn't to packed, it was actually perfect cus all the kids weren't fighting over the bounce houses! It's a huge area with about 15 bounce houses and there is even a lounge area for adults that has comfy couches and a big screen tv and an area for the kids to play video games (no additional charge!) There was a kitchen area to order food! We didn't order food cus we just ate before we got there but the kitchen was super clean! The owner was awesome! He was very professional!!! Make sure you wear socks cus he keeps the place clean and bounce houses safe by having everyone take their shoes off even their employees! (Except when in the kitchen) I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Update: went back last night with my toddler and some friends. They still won't allow water in, but they'll allow you to bring your own food in for a birthday party. I no longer understand their logic.  I brought my two year old for the first time yesterday. She had a great time. The owner was very nice, and checked to make sure we were having fun. It's very clean, there is ample seating, and there is a room for parents with free wifi. They also have video games, which is kind of cool. Also, admission is 2-for-1 if you're with a child who is two or under.   So why 3 stars? There were a few things that could be changed/improved: 1. The temperature. Because of the size of the place, the fans keeping the bounce houses blown up, and the skylights, this place is hot. I was sweating after being in there for 10 minutes.   2. The variety. There are a couple things for really young kids, an obstacle course, a basketball hoop, and a giant slide. Other than that, everything else is either your basic bounce house, or a bounce house with something like a slide inside of it. My kid would be happy with that for a long time, but an older kid would probably get bored after a while.   3A. The no drink/food rule, specifically the rule about water. Nothing, not even water, is supposed to be brought in from outside. I guess I can understand the logic behind that, but it's water. Bottled water is pricey, and water fountains can get kind of gross.   3B. The snack bar. There is a snack bar that doesn't offer much in the way of snacks, other than cotton candy and popcorn. They do offer chicken fingers, hot dogs, and pizza, but those aren't really snacks. Not for a little kid, at least. The snack thing is actually why we ended up leaving. She wanted a snack, but I couldn't give her anything I had packed, and it wasn't worth getting pizza or chicken fingers because she'd probably eat 2 bites. Bounce house places are pretty popular with toddlers because they get some of that energy out, so a place like this can expect a large portion of their customers to be toddlers and their parents, especially during the week. There needs to be actual snack food available for them. Go to any toddler place in town (Fidgets, Giggles and Hugs) and look at what they offer, then expand your snack menu.   Most places in town have tried to implement a no outside snack rule and failed because that's a really difficult thing to do with little kids. In fact, the very first thing my parent friends look at when a new place opens is if outside snacks are allowed. A lot of toddlers have food sensitivities or allergies, so they need specific items. Toddlers tend to be picky and stubborn, and go on these food strikes where they only eat one thing for a week. My daughter once decided to live off of yogurt. If a kid is going through a phase like that, the parents can't visit an establishment that absolutely restricts outside food. It just doesn't work.   I can understand not wanting pizza and happy meals brought in, especially for parties, but it doesn't make sense for snack foods, especially when a bunch of your customers are toddlers.    This place has the potential to be a 5-star establishment, but some of this stuff needs to be fixed, and the food rule needs to be reexamined.k"}
{"text":"Great place for your kids, not bad food. Have two areas where you can seat and eat. Kids can work off all of that energy.  I would recommend this place to other people to try."}
{"text":"Wonderful Indoor bouncy play area. Since everything Is bouncy relate i.e. Cushiony, it's safe. My 3 year old has a blast every time we visit! I got the wristband once and it's lots of fun!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Bouncy world, and to be honest it seemed very plain. There is a lot of bouncy houses (about 10) but all of them are basically the same thing inside (they need the obstacle course bouncy houses) They also have a Game Center, and a little food stand that seems to be way overpriced for what they have. I believe the floors should be padded, I don't understand why they would please carpet over concrete (at least that's what it feels like) I would not recommend the food. Something just seems to be missing from this place. For $10 a kid I believe they should offer a little bit more variety or something.   My review was going to be three stars but after my wife lost her phone, we called bouncy world and told them exactly where we were at. They told us it was not there. We later called again to doublecheck, and again we were told it was not there. My wife ended up going down there just to check and right away found the phone exactly where she told them she had left it in the first place (and it was not busy at all)"}
{"text":"I have been to this place a couple of times and I have to say, it is really nice!  It's immaculate and fun! The restroom was really clean. The guys that work there are very attentive and so polite! What a pleasure!"}
{"text":"As a mom with really energetic kids, i look for places to burn some of it off. Bouncy World is at the top of my list. I have been several times, and it is ALWAYS clean, well maintained, and has the friendliest staff of any kids place that I have been to here in Vegas. The staff play and interact with the kids, the owners stop and chat, asking what, if anything they can do to improve my experience there. Great customer service! The snack bar is reasonably priced and has a good variety of snacks and drinks. Lots of table seating. The lounge area is comfortable and roomy. Televisions and free wifi. Located at the front so you can keep an eye on kiddos. Bathrooms are CLEAN! Always a good indicator of the pride a business takes in itself. Especially hard to keep up after how busy they are with so many kids, but they do a great job. There are video games, air hockey tables, giant floor games, balls to throw and play with, but the real reason for being here are the big assortment of bounce houses. Also there is a  toddler area for 4 years and younger with smaller houses. It's a more mellow area for the little ones.  On Thursdays there is a special added treat of face painting and/or balloon animals. The lady is so friendly and patient, plus there's no added charge for this, tips appreciated. I can't say enough nice things about this place. Never a bad experience here. I recommend to friends with kids if they've never been here. In fact, i was here yesterday with \"newbies\" and they all loved it. 4 hours later, and we moms were ready to go, but the kids were still going strong!  Bouncy World has what it takes to succeed. Come out and support these guys!  Now to plan these upcoming birthday parties! See you soon Bouncy World!"}
