{"text":"We are from Chicago traveling through Medina and did an internet search for Chinese resturants in the  area and Hop Hing was highly recommended. Prices are excellent, portions for lunch specials are generous, the resturant with a few tables simple  and clean with open view to the kitchen .The staff is very friendly with allergy substitutions.We had the chicken and broccoli with egg roll and beef with Chinese vegetables with egg drop soup ,both were delicious, 
Actually the egg drop soup was one of the best we ever had.
Worth going out of the way for."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food for a good 
price.  Sesame chicken is the best I've ever had.  Hot and sour soup also is fantastic and hearty.  Mainly a take out place but a decent amount of seating if you want to eat in."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would . Worst Oriental food place ever. Spend $48 they assure me the order is complete. Get home and missing half our food. The conversation on the phone to remedy the problem ( in almost unrecognizable english ) was terrible. Arrive with order sheet in hand and they say the order was correct and we must pay for what we say is missing.  Im sorry!!!! They screwed up. The last thing on my mind when ordering was not \" how can I screw this restaurant out of food\". I had people that were hungry half who had to eat an hour later. Two trips. And a total lack of customer service all in the name of trying to make a buck. Never ever again will I eat anything from this place. I will tell every person I know about this awful experience in hopes that one day they will have to close their doors."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Basic Chinese food. Prices are about average and we only go here every once in a while."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Chinese food in northeastern Ohio! Excellent service take in or take out.Very reasonable prices ,generous servings, fresh and delicious ingredients.My wife and I have tried many places and none of them can beat Hop Hing!!!"}
{"text":"I've been there twice and both experiences were awful. Most recently I ordered orange chicken for my son. He'd asked for noodles instead of rice and I asked the gentleman who took my order if that was okay. Told it was fine. 

When I went to pick it up, I was told the noodles were an upcharge of $3.75! I don't mind an upcharge for a substitution, but $3.75 for noodles without being told. When I asked about it I was told I can pay for it or not get the noodles. 

Never ever again."}
{"text":"Small shrimp Lo Mein: tasty and flavorful. Shrimp was over cooked. Beef with Beef W. Broccoli combo, I didn't want fried rice so this is not how the combo comes: carrots were my only issue (it was dry no flavor). It was still yummy, a little on the sweeter side. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"\"A fantastic Chinese place. The hot and sour soup is the best we have tasted. Ambiance is not great but the food is delicious. Enjoy!!\""}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the strip mall area that this place is in. I wasn't too sure about going in when I first saw it but I'm glad I did. My wife and I ordered General Tso's chicken, some fried potstickers, and a couple of eggrolls to share. The eggrolls were nice and crunchy on the outside and full of flavor on the inside. The potstickers were full of meat and delicious. The General Tso's was exactly the way we like it. A little more sweet than spicy and lots of sauce with large chunks of chicken. This place will definitely get our repeat business."}
{"text":"Two separate times, we called in orders to Hop Hing. They said 15-20 minutes. When we showed up, on time, they started working on our order. Then we had to wait 15-20 more minutes. No thanks, Hop Hing."}
{"text":"Your average Chinese take out place. Has decent food and decent sized portions - slightly on the greasy side. You could do better, but you could also do worse."}
{"text":"Hang on to your belts, friends!  If you like the Dragon Buffet like i do you will like Hop Hing that serves up American-sized portions that will take you for a delicious ride! They have the same menu because they are owned by the same family. Not a Fan of the white or brown rice like me don't worry subsitute for low mein nuddles like i do that what depends on what you order. 

  The Staff is awesome, friendly and helpful just like if your were to go to the Dragon Buffet down the street. Not sure what you wanna order or in the mood to try something new just ask the staff. Don't feel like waiting for your order stop by place your order then walk around the shops and when the 15 minutes or so is up return and your order will be ready. 

    If you never stopped by or had Chinesse food from this place you are so missing out stop by today and try some chinesse food."}
{"text":"This has always been and will always be my favorite takeout spot. My usual order? General Tso's chicken and fried rice. I have never been disappointed, and I keep coming back for more. They serve great food at a great price, and it's always hot and ready when we come in to pick it up. Don't believe how great this place is? I've been biking there to pick up takeout since before I had my drivers license. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"It is a simple take away eatery with a free tables inside.  Some of the best food of this kind in Medina.  Homemade, fresh, and cooked too order.  Do be afraid to customize you spice level!  Pleasant staff."}
{"text":"Love the Moo Shu Pork and fried rice. Food is always fresh and hot. The hot and sour soup is the heartiest I have ever had. It is full of everything! Very good. We have tried at least five or six different dishes from here and all have been very good. Great take out place!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good Chinese at a nice price.  This is my standard go-to place for Chinese carry-out.  The staff is really friendly and they prepare your food quickly.  I'm always eager to gobble up more of my leftovers 20 minutes after getting full the first time (yep, that's the mark of good Chinese food!).

Stop by Mama Joes a few doors down and get a pie for dessert."}
{"text":"Voted best chinese food in medina. Ordered general tso's chicken, house fried rice and house soup. We barely put a dent on the fried rice. My wife and I love the shrimp crackers and ended up buying 4 packs. The flavors are very good. Better than any of the ones we have tried. Next time we will order some szechuan and will compare it to the ones that we've had in ca. Lots of selection at a very good price. This is a good find in our town."}
{"text":"Great Chinese and Employees.  The reason I removed 1 Star was no delivery.  I love the fact that while you are waiting for the food to be made that they have some Hot Tea and it is great.  Plus the Sauces (including the hot mustard) adds to the flavor."}
{"text":"If you enjoy diarhea, migraines, dizzyness and nausea, this place is for you. 

Tried this place just to try a new place and was rewarded with the entire family sick yesterday from food poisoning but what felt like a stomach flu. 

Never should have tried something else in the area instead of House of Hunan."}
{"text":"The food here runs mediocre, especially when there's higher quality Chinese take-out available in the area.  The biggest issue is that of the 4 trips made there, twice they've snuck meat into the order of a vegetarian.

They are barely apologetic about it either, and will make excuses.

Still, when you can't be confident that you will get what you are ordering, you simply cannot order from a restaurant - vegetarian or not."}
{"text":"Food has good flavor at a very reasonable price. Portions are smaller than there competition. Overall not bad for quick takeout."}
{"text":"A good place to grab servicable Chinese food.  It's not great, but you know what you are getting.  Plus, they are one of the few places around here that doesn't use MSG."}
{"text":"I came to yelp to find a suggestion on a good chinese take out restaurant near work. I took the suggestion of someone and tried the hot and sour soup. I used to work in tallmadge and a take out place near that job had a GREAT hot and sour soup. All others that I have tasted are gross. So i bit the bullet and ordered the hot and sour soup and an order of crab rangoon. Both items are FANTASTIC!!!! I also love their home made hot mustard (unlike the packet kind). Decently priced and the large soup is HUGE. I got the large (hoping it was as good as previous reviews had said) so that i could take some to my mother after work. I think she will love it also. Great place to go!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a local chinese restaurant that produces quality food nearly every time, this is it.  They usually have the food ready in 15-20 minutes on call in orders.  The food portions tend to be on the large size so I would recommend a small size when ordering.  Prices are fair and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Very, very good. Food was excellent. Servers were a couple young men that did an outstanding job. The only complaint was the food was a little slow coming out but that could have been because at 6:30 there was probably a doz people waiting for takeout . It was busy the whole time we were their."}
{"text":"Hang on to your belts, friends!  Hop Hing serves up American-sized portions that will take you for a delicious ride!

Hubby and I bought a house recently and in the process of getting it move-in ready, we pretty much ate our way through Medina.  We were delighted with our experience at Hop Hing.  It's a small dine-in or carry-out kind of place, not much for decor, but the service is always with a smile, the food is made fresh, and the portions are ridiculous! The food is piping hot when you pick it up and still piping hot when you get home.  

I recommend the Bourbon Chicken (we asked the gal behind the counter if Bourbon Chicken is really Chinese - she smiled and told us they make it for their American friends :)). It is savory and sweet, and paired with the bone-in short ribs.. you're in for a treat!  

Don't be surprised if that same gal behind the counter gives you trinkets her grandma brought back from China.  It's been known to happen."}
{"text":"I called ahead and asked if they had a noodle that was called something like \"fan\"   The girl answered no. So I ordered my normal shrimp lo mein and egg rolls. When I picked up I saw the daily special on the wall as chicken mei fun. I asked the girl why didn't you offer fun when I asked. She said you asked about fan not fun that'll be 26.50. Then proceeds to speak to other workers in her native language and dismissed me. Once I got home and tasted the egg rolls and fried noodles that came with the shrimp lo mein I tasted the same flavor old grease  I have been a customer of this restaurant for 5 years. I will not go back."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good Chinese restaurant. It's not great, but it's good. Some of their good dishes are their egg drop soup, chicken lo mein, hunan chicken. I tried their bourbon chicken and black pepper chicken and did not care for them very much. But again, overall average Chinese food for the area."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Dragon Buffet like I am you'll love Hop Hing.  They have the same menu because they are owned by the same family.

I love some good cheap Chinese food and Hop Hing is that place for me in Medina.  I've been going here for years and it is consistently good.  I love the Shrimp Fried Rice and Sesame Chicken to name a few.  

Hop Hing has a few tables that you can sit at for eat in but this basically a take out place.  If you're looking for a good sit down Chinese place this isn't it, but you will be impressed by the food."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I have had since moving to Medina!! We ordered the Moo Goo Gai Pan, Sesame Chicken and steamed dumplings and they were delicious!! Even my 3 year old who is a super picky eater loved it! We will definitely be ordering from here again soon!"}
{"text":"Favorite Chinese food in medina. People are very nice an get your order right every time! Doesn't take long to get food."}
{"text":"I went here the other day and just wasn't that impressed, I've had way better Chinese food. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Best in Mentor!! We absolutely love this place and eat here regularly! The sweet and sour chicken is fantastic! We also love the soup!"}
{"text":"This is our take out Chinese spot. Not the quality of Imperial Dragon but less expensive and still consistently very good. They have no problem with vegetarian options. Don't be afraid if a ten year old picks up the phone, that young man has never messed my order up once."}
{"text":"I've eaten at all the Chinese restaurants around Lake county. This one has the best flavor and biggest portions for your money. Even the \"good\" spots can't compare. Best around"}
{"text":"Food is always good hot people are really friendly I really enjoyed going in there and getting authentic Chinese food"}
