{"text":"I was torn between giving Jack's 2 or 3 stars.  I have eaten here at least 10 times of times, and I have never been blown away, but they're pretty consistently okay, when it comes to Jewish style deli food.

The dining area is pretty clean and very open, and during the brunch and meal-time rushes, it's packed.  It's the go-to place for non-Kosher Jewish-style deli food in the Heights neighborhoods of Cleveland's near-East side.  It's competition is Corky & Lenny's, which is about 5 miles and 20 minutes away, which is better in my opinion, but not by a lot.

Let's start with the service, however, which has never been great. We have had some okay service, but mostly sub-par.  It's like they train their servers and bussers to keep a straight face and hide in the back in between forays out to the dining area.  If I were to rate the service on a scale of 1-10, I'd give it a 4.

As I said the food is perfectly okay.  How can you screw up hot pastrami or corned beef, when all you have to do is heat it and slice it and pile it on rye ... no complaints there, but it's certainly no Slyman's.  I saw a lot of other reviewers really liked their matzoh ball soup, and I don't get what they see.  I find the soup bland and the matzoh ball even blander.  It tastes to me like chicken bullion consume and a salt-free matzoh ball.  I wouldn't waste my time or ingest the calories.  I really hope that no real chickens had to lose their lives for this soup, because their flavor got lost along the way and their lives were lived in vain.

I also saw a lot of people comment that they liked the pickles; again, I find them very bland ... essentially salt-brined cucumbers.  It's rare to find delis that make really good pickles, especially since they have to make so much to meet the demand of a pretty busy clientele, so there isn't time for them to really sit and soak up the vinegar and other flavors.  I usually pick up one of the pickles from the plate more by habit, and I almost always set it back down after the first disappointing bite.

I will say that their breakfasts are perfectly good and their sandwiches are fine too - fine, not amazing.  Unless this is your only exposure to this style of food, I can't see why anyone would rave about it.  If I weren't so lazy, I'd avoid Jack's all together and drive the extra 20 minutes to Corky & Lenny's in Woodmere.

I'll go back to Jack's again, but it's doubtful I will ever do so with great enthusiasm.  The food passes, but it doesn't inspire, and it all feels like you're paying $1 - $2 more than it's worth."}
{"text":"My favorite deli in NE Ohio, by far. In addition to the expected sandwiches (corned beef, chopped liver and off-the-bone turkey are particularly noteworthy fillings) and soups (the split pea and mushroom barley are both tops), Jack's also turns out a mean breakfast. The corned beef hash is outstanding, and the omelets are way above average - fluffy and tender, not those sad pancake-looking things some restaurants try to pass off."}
{"text":"Brisket was pretty good, but their macaroni salad was a bit too sweet for me. The environment and food is definitely more catered to an older audience."}
{"text":"Looking for good Jewish food in Cleveland? Jack's deli is really great (and it's pretty near my home in South Euclid!). I got their Chicken Schnitzel and it came with a bowl of matzoh ball soup and a dish of kugel. Yum!

They're famous for everything you'd expect... bagels lox and cream cheese, matzo ball soup and corned beef sandwiches. Pictures and a link to their full menu are on my blog here: http://whatsincleveland.blogspot.com/2011/06/jacks-deli.html"}
{"text":"First time visit. Purchased two corned beef sandwiches as carryout. Excellent service, clean establishment and polite staff. The food was DELICIOUS. Lived in this area a long time and always drove past Jack's but then when the new Hyatt hotel opened at Legacy Village; Jack's was listed as a nearby restaurant decided to try it. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by at their new location for lunch today and was not disappointed to say the least! The complimentary pickles, Ruben, and cottage fries were delicious. They also offer GLUTEN FREE bread, which is a huge plus! Staff was very friendly, and overall, we had a great experience."}
{"text":"My first trip to Cleveland and Jack's came highly recomended and rightfully so. The place was busy but there was never a lack of service during the lunch rush. I ordered the Rueben and my fiancé had the Club. I am picky when it comes to Rueben's and this one was by far the best one I have ever had and my fiancé was impressed with his food as well. The portions are huge so come hungry. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because the decor is dated but I didn't come for the decor."}
{"text":"Half chicken dinner and stiffed cabbage.  It was delicious and all gone before I could get my camera out."}
{"text":"If you want delicious deli food...look no further. I'm a corned beef hash junkie, and this is the best I've had. Great sandwiches, too. Love this place."}
{"text":"Best corned beef sandwich I've ever had, hands down. Nothing beats it! I've loved it here since I attended Notre Dame College and still love it nearly seven years later."}
{"text":"Everything was on point on St Patty's! Best corned beef in town. We got the triple decker, corned beef sandwich and potato pancakes with corned beef. Everything was on point. Place is usually poppin' too, so be prepared for a wait."}
{"text":"I've patronized Jack's a few times for takeout/deli orders and recently went there for breakfast.  It was midmorning on a weekend, but fortunately the dining room is spacious and the two of us were seated right away.  I can't give the dining area any points for ambiance, but it is clean and well-lit, which is all I really need when I'm eating out before noon.

The service was fine-- we were seated instantly, ordered drinks right after that, and had them within a minute or two.  Our server was friendly and efficient, checking on us a couple of times during the meal for coffee warm-ups.  It looks like other reviewers on here have unfortunately had very different experiences in this department, so I'm taking care here to point out that we were very happy with the service!

The coffee was a standard breakfast diner kind of brew, which is just what I want when I'm out for breakfast.  I had the corned beef hash, which comes with two poached eggs and toast (I went with challah but they also have white/wheat/and I think also rye).  The eggs were perfectly done and the meal overall was very good.  It was a large portion; I am a fairly light eater and would have been satisfied with half as much.  My boyfriend had the club sandwich, which was also a substantial amount of food.  I am counting the days until we can go back so that I can try the latkes + lox and the challah french toast!

I agree with other reviewers who have pointed out that the value at Jack's is not excellent.  Our bill was about $23 before tip, which is a bit much, in my opinion, for anyplace with \"deli\" in the name.  It isn't bad enough to keep me from going back... we just won't be going as often as I would like to."}
{"text":"I've been on a quest to find great corned beef hash & eggs - Manhattan, Chicago, Toronto, LA, Sydney. Who knew it was practically in my backyard! If you like your corned beef hash finely shredded and sautéed with minced onion, then try Jack's. They have awesome cottage fries - thinly sliced potato discs that tasted like potato chips (see photo). We actually stopped into Jack's because the line for First Watch was out the door (merely choosing First Watch for convenience since we had some shopping to do over at Whole Foods afterwards). 

If you're looking for a solid, inexpensive breakfast - served all day - with attentive service (my cup of coffee never went past half empty), then go to Jack's Deli. Our bill was $14.50, which included two meals and beverages - not bad!"}
{"text":"We are new to Cleveland and just had the absolute luck of eating at Jack's for the first time this weekend.  THIS IS A MUST if you love good, comfort food and EXCELLENT service (Angela).  We started the meal with an excellent Bloody Mary and pierogis that make you think you used a passport to get in.  The Corned beef hash with poached eggs is divine and my husband had a pastrami sandwich he would not stop calling our friends back East to brag about.  Jacks is delicious food with no pretension.  So grateful we found it!  We'll be back to eat our way through the menu!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best deli in Cleveland. Better than most places I've had in LA too. 
I know, everything is the \"best\" in Cleveland but Jack's is the real deal. Melt in your mouth corned beef sandwiches, great potato pancakes, lox, knishes! You'll get a great plate of two styles of pickles, maybe tomatoes too if you're lucky(!), from some of the nicest bussers in town. I could eat here every day. It's pricey but it seems that most quality delis are, the difference is at Jack's, you don't feel shortchanged like you might at um, other delis."}
{"text":"Not sure what the big deal is with this place. The food was expensive and average at best when I dined in.  As other yelpers have commented, you don't get what you pay for at Jack's. But don't tell that to the senior citizen crowds that tend to overrun the place!  They seem to really enjoy it."}
{"text":"ORDER ONLINE!!!

Came to Cleveland to watch the baseball game (Toronto vs Cleveland) and decided to grab lunch here on our way out of town. While viewing the menu on their website, we noticed that you can order online and choose what time to pick up! So glad we ordered online. It was packed when we got there (Sunday at noon). We walked in and our take out order was ready for us behind the register. I

We ate in the car and noticed that people would park their cars in the parking lot...walk in...and walk straight out because the line-up was too long.

Reuban Sandwich (with corned beef) 5/5 - Russian sauce was packed on the side. LOADED with corned beef which was very moist and flavourful. The bread was perfectly toasted (panini style) and the cheese was assembled between the sauerkraut and bread so, the bread was still nice and toasty when I ate it!

Corned Beef Sandwich 5/5 - LOADED with corned beef. Similar comment as above.

Potato Salad 4/5 - Tasted like old-fashioned potato salad. Looked like they used egg as well! Was a little too creamy (too much mayo?) for my taste but, it was still great!

Coleslaw 4/5 - Tasted great! Was not watery but similar to the potato salad, had a bit too much mayo for my liking. 

Pickles - not your typical pickles. They were not vinegary/ pickled very long but, I really enjoyed them! They were crunchy and has more of a cucumber-flavour because they were not pickled very long...? The pickles were packed separately (packed in a little sandwich bag with a twist tie) within the takeout container which was great because it prevented the liquid from making the bread soggy."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best place for breakfast in the Cleveland area. The service is attentive and very fast. Everyone works extremely well as a team. Your cup of coffee will never go below a half of a cup. The challah French toast is some of the best I've ever had! 

You regularly see the owner of the place on the floor busing tables. This is the tone that is set. I've always been greeted with a smile when I arrive. You can not go wrong. You may wait a bit at certain times but that's because this place is so awesome!"}
{"text":"I have been to Jack's twice now, once on Christmas day, and once on a Saturday morning.  The first experience was much better than the second, but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt.

I think the prices here are normal, so I don't know why and of their prices are really being talked about in the reviews.  Breakfast including coffee for 10 bucks.  That seems typical.

The corned beef hash is really good, but the second time I had it, it had a lot more onions than the first time.  I want consistency from a restaurant, so that kind of bothered me.  Service was also much slower the second time around.  It seemed that we may have come at shift-change time.  All the servers were complaining that they wanted to go home and didn't want to take more tables.  So I guess they need to find better evening servers who come in on time to relieve the morning servers.  On Christmas, our server was delightful and prompt with everything.

I will probably go back here, but not on the weekend."}
{"text":"This corned beef is the best I've ever had. Go get some. Seriously."}
{"text":"What a lucky find. Traveling through Ohio on the way to a family wedding in Nebraska from Maryland. What a find. After our \"Diners Drive-ins and Dives\" pick (Geraci's) was closed due to a power failure we quickly Yelped for alternatives and this place popped up. Intrigued by the description and eating at several great Jewish Delis in Philly we gave it a try. Great luck. The family had  potato pancakes appetizer, chicken noodle soup, hot borscht, onion rings with a triple decker (corned beef AND pastrami) the mini bagel sampler and the veggie burger. All were great. 
To top it off the manager brought our table a huge iPad mini sized brownie because it was my daughters 18nth birthday. What great customer service.  
I also had the old fashioned seltzer where there was so much carbon dioxide in it it made my nose burn as I drank. 
I'd most definitely come again. This is the kind of place you don't forget."}
{"text":"We were starving after a long flight and had always heard about this place but never been. Since we live close by we gave it a try and were not disappointed. It was just the right comfort food we needed and more. We ordered more than we could eat, loved their knish and sandwich. I would not be able to eat here everyday but for one of those days when u have to have a corned beef sandwich and u want it NOW..I would go here since it's so close."}
{"text":"I've been a local at Jacks for about 10 years now. Jack's most definitely has its core competencies.  Their rubin knishes are a masterpiece and their Nova Boy is top notch.  Some of the best corned beef and potato pancakes on the East Side. I dislike one of their waitresses, HOWEVER two of their waitresses are the best EVER and the rest are pretty good too."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Jewish deli in Cleveland. The corned beef sandwich and the Reuben are absolutely incredible. The Reuben is grilled on a panini grill so it's less like a grilled cheese. I used to think Slymans was the best... until I stopped at Jack's a couple of years ago. It's not even close."}
{"text":"We are always on the look out for a new breakfast spot and we found a new favorite at Jack's Deli!
Their breakfast menu isn't huge but I think there is enough of a selection where most people will find something they will enjoy. I've been here a few times in the last few weeks (yes, I liked it that much), and I have no complaints about the food! The eggs benedict is really good, I also highly recommend trying the Challah granola french toast (sooo good!). My boyfriend had the potato pancake sliders and said they were also delicious! They came stacked with a ton of meat! My only complaint is that my first cup of coffee almost every time seems to be a burnt...But my refills have been better. I'm also not a huge fan of the pickles (they offer to bring you a plate of them upon arrival), they seem to have been rushed through the pickling process, and to me are more like slightly pickled cucumbers. That being said, my mom and sister actually really liked them! Anywayyyyy, I'll continue to frequent this deli, until I get sick of it! hehehe"}
{"text":"I had a craving for some Kosher-style deli food and Jack's came highly recommended (thanks to you yelpers). The husband and I drove out in possibly the worst weather imaginable to the east side to eat some of Jack's deliciousness.

I started off with none other than a Dr. Brown's cream soda, the best! We were also immediately presented with some pickles for the table (my only complaint about these is that we didn't get any sours in our plate). The dills were very good, however.

I had a bowl of matzo ball soup which, as I found out from the waitress, still has only one matzo ball but is housed in twice as much broth. And oh, the broth! Amazingly salty, perfectly yellow, with not a vegetable in sight.  Just as it should be.

I paired this soup with a half-sandwich piled high with their house turkey (off the bone), on rye, with thousand island dressing on the side. My husband had a pastrami sandwich, which he enjoyed a lot, and said was spiced with something \"out of the ordinary.\" We both loved the bread, which was soft and flavorful, and whose crust was crisp without threatening to break off a tooth.

We also each ordered knishes--potato for me, cheddar-potato for him--and we were presented with some out-there options such as the reuben knish. Maybe another day.

The soup, half-sandwich, and half of my knish proved to be just enough (well, ok, maybe I DID shove a couple bites too many of my sandwich in there). We took home some leftovers, of course, which is half the fun. We also got a quarter-pound of whitefish salad and two remarkable, enormous chocolate-chip cookies at the counter on the way out.

All in all, well worth the trip East."}
{"text":"This is specifically for the party tray.  We ordered a tray for 25 and it easily fed 30 with lots of leftovers.  Everything was plentiful.  If I had any complaints it would be that the pickles weren't pickled enough but that is very minor.  

The presentation is very nice and it comes well wrapped.  Delivery was right on time and came with plates and silverware.  The only thing they didn't bring was napkins.  Not sure if that was an oversight or they aren't included so ask if you are expecting them.

I am very happy and will certainly recommend them."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and surprisingly slow service. 

I came in about 11:40 on a Thursday afternoon. Dinning room was only 1/3 full, but I had to wait to be seated. 

Went thru the pictures here on Yelp and decided on the mushroom barley soup and open face tuna. The soup did come out quickly, and it was hot, but seemed to be missing something...like mushrooms. Doctored it up with some salt and pepper and it improved. 

Had a bit of downtime from the completion of the soup to the delivery of the sandwich. The old lady sitting next to me also complained to her waitress that she would like her sandwich with her soup. While I continued to wait, a younger couple came in and they asked for a high chair. The hostess looked at them as if they had 2 heads. 

Tuna came with fries. It was HUGE. But that's about the only thing positive I can say about it. Like the soup, it was bland. And the French fries were krinkle cut fries and tasted like they were frozen Orida fries baked in my oven. Nothing special at all. 

By the time I left, the place was 2/3 full and there were 10 people in line to get in. I paid my tab, walked back to the table with a tip, and passed the same 10 people a few minutes later. 

Also, they promote all the free pickles you want. Maybe you have to ask for them, as I had a couple served with my water, but none offered thereafter. 

Lastly, if I had read the menu rather than ordering off Yelp pictures, I probably would have seen the tuna was served on rye. It made the whole thing taste a bit odd. I would have expected the waitress to confirm that I wanted rye when I ordered."}
{"text":"While in town for a personal convention, I made my way to Jack's based mostly on Yelp reviews for a late breakfast.  I was not disappointed.

I ordered take-out over the phone, and the gruff all-business order taker listened intently and managed to bark out \"20 minutes\" at the end of the call.

I ordered the potato pancakes with applesauce and sour cream.  They were delicious.

I also tried, for the first time, a \"blintze.\" (one alternative spelling is \"blintz\")  Where have I been? I haven't had nor heard of this before today!  A blintze is basically a cheese-filled crepe served with cherry and/or blueberry compote.  It was delicious, and I see many of these in my future!!  Nice flaky texture, delicious filling, great balance between the dryness of the cheese and the sweetness of the fruit.  Simply awesome!

The menu is very nice, and I had a hard time not ordering more!!

The cashier was friendly, and based on the number of orders waiting for pickup, more than a few people had the same idea as me on this Sunday Morning.

The prices are higher than I'd expect, and higher than I think even the suburban market in my hometown Pittsburgh would tolerate.  However, it seems like the place is not willing to sacrifice quality to reduce prices by a couple bucks.  I can tell by the efficiency of the place that it's well run and that quality comes first.

I think I'd be a regular of this place if I lived nearby.  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Jack's Deli, OMG, best deli in Ohio hands down.  Growing up we took frequent trips to NYC and Detroit - their delis are the gold standard.  Now that I live in the west coast it's impossible to get decent deli.  This year I was in Cleveland 4 times and for the 3 visits where I had a car - I went to Jack's.  

The deli meat is really delicious and so is the soup.  My mom loves being able to get chopped liver and halvah (a kind of candy bar).  

There are these Yiddish words on the walls [including Haymich a la Hunger Games].  It's fun to see which ones you know.

Every time we seem to have the same waitress.  She's worked there forever and is very spunky.

You won't be disappointed at Jack's."}
{"text":"Matzo ball soup was very bland.  Potato pancake good.  Food for party of four delivered at separate times.  OK overall but better deli food at Corky & Lenny's."}
{"text":"Always a family favorite. Ordered two small deli trays. Presentation was beautiful, quantity and quality of food excellent."}
{"text":"My favorite deli.  I had the CB and wife had the smoked fish platter (for one).  Both excellent choices.  My CB was perfect.  Our waitress was really great, efficient and personable.  After a very busy July 4 AM, the place was respectably clean."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best burgers around. Great breakfasts too. Reasonably priced. Servers are pleasant too."}
{"text":"Just plane crazy good food; especially the corned beef hash for breakfast.  I could eat at this place 3 - 4 times a week.  They have great daily specials that are usually discounted off their normal process.   Corned Beef Tuesday is my favorite day. 

The service varies and will depend on how crowded and how well they know you.  I have been there on occasions where my cup never goes empty, and others where I have to get up and go ask for a refill.  And while that is annoying, it does not alter they way I feel about this place.  It is certainly in the top 5 places to go in CLE."}
{"text":"I can see why people like this place but honestly I did not see what the big deal is.  It reminds me of Simon ' s Deli...very large portions of straight-up, no frills deli items.  A turkey and salami sandwich cost $14.  For run-of-the-mill ingredients I don't get it.  I don't mind paying $14 for a sandwich with delicious, unique ingredients so price is not the issue.  Pretty big menu.  If it's an old school Jewish deli you seek then by all means go here and enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal food!  One sandwich can feed two adults.  This is a must 'go-to' place, when you visit Cleveland.  I split the reuben with my wife and I also had a bowl of borsch soup which was served cold...it caught me off guard, but was still great with a big plop of sour cream."}
{"text":"We've been here a number of times. The food is always good... the potato pancakes made by the hand of God. 
This time, it was a rainy cold Homecoming at JCU. we took the parents to our favorite deli instead of tailgating. Jack's did a great job of accommodating 11 people, and the service was good. The snag? I ordered a corned beef Sammie.  When it came, I thought it looked like pastrami.  I took one bite and thought it tasted like bologna. The waitress ran back to our table saying someone had the wrong sandwich. I suggested it might be me. Here was her mistake.. instead of just taking it she said \"oh! That's the tongue!\" Now keep in mind while we were waiting in line a two foot long tongue was displayed in the deli case so I had plenty of time to work up a good ick.. not that I would EVER order it anyway. Then, instead of whisking away the offensive plate, she stood behind me staring. Thankfully, the owner was helping serve our table and had the presence of mind to whisk away the offending plate, and offered to replace it. Unfortunately, I don't know if I'll ever be able to separate corned beef from tongue in my poor scarred brain right now. Good news is they made it right, and gave me a corned beef to go... which I gave to my JCU student to take back to his dorm. Everyone else had a great brunch. I'm calling this review \"\"Jack slipped me the tongue\"."}
{"text":"If all I wanted was a good corned beef sandwich, there's probably other places I would go before Jacks. But when I'm looking for corned beef and exceptionally good latkes with a side of the best soup in town, there's no better place than jacks deli. The latkes have a nice texture and are always cooked to perfection. The matzo balls in their soup have just the right amount of give. They're not tough, but they don't fall apart at the slightest touch. We went there this passed Friday and they were offering a soup and sandwich combo for $10. I decided to go with the matzo ball soup and half a corned beef sandwich. For a buck or two, you can upgrade it to a Ruben if you'd like as well. They'll also give you lean corned beef on the sandwich free of charge. If you're really hungry, I'd suggest getting the Jared fressers delight. It's corned beef served on two potato pancakes with sour cream and apple sauce. The only thing I can say I don't really like here is the pastrami. Ultimately, I'd definitely recommend hitting this place up if you're looking for somewhere clean that's serving up some delicious food!"}
{"text":"I have the Matza Ball Soup, Wedge Salad, and Ruben. Everything was delish. This was my first time going and will not be my last. I cant believe I've lived her my whole life and have never been to Jacks!"}
{"text":"What you would expect of a local mom and pop shop. Service was good. My husband loves their sandwiches. Definitely not a place for a veggie or vegan, but most delis aren't. Would benefit from some updates."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I have a wheat intolerance. I can eat it, but in limited quantities. That being said, this I believe is the best place to get a sandwich if you have to eat gluten free. I think their gluten free bread might just be better than their regular bread. My family is fast becoming regulars here. I've had better matzo ball soup elsewhere, and their meats are pretty standard. Service definitely favors if you are a regular, but it's easy enough to get a tasty meal. They will also sub sides and give you exactly what you want but it may cost you extra, they make sure to tell you when you order if it will. All in all, this place is a nice old style dinner deli that is good for those who are selective."}
{"text":"Great ny style old school deli. Wish I had that deli counter in my kitchen and the lox is incredible. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Amazing Jewish deli. Everything I've had is great. I tend to go with corned beef sandwich or corned beef hash. Their latkes and matzo ball soup are superb. Every time I go their I also get a pound of corned bed and a quart of matzo ball soup to go. I recently discovered their bagels are amazing. The service is always good. Be prepared for a wait if you come at prime time. This place is 10x better than Corky and Lenny's. This is the place to go for the classic great Jewish deli foods. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Cleveland has a number of Jewish delis spotted around, and this is a great one.  Snack on some pickles while you're waiting for your rueben or pastrami on rye."}
{"text":"Although I grew up on the east side of Cleveland, I have have lived in New York City and Philadelphia. In other words, I know from deli -- good and bad. And Jack's is bad. Very bad. You should expect an unconscionable wait if you go at any time that humans typically eat meals. This is not because seating is limited, but because the staff moves at a pace slower than the restaurant's 83-year old patrons.  Then, once you are seated, prepare for a rude and disinterested wait staff -- even by deli standards. As for the food itself, let's just say that the food served at my grandmother's nursing home is more flavorful.  On my last visit, I had a bowl of cold, bland chicken soup and a fatty extra lean corned beef sandwich. Jack's has lived in the shadows of its better known rival -- Corky's and Lenny's -- for years. Rightfully so. My advice is to drive the extra few miles to Corky's and have a decent deli experience."}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland for a wedding and was hearing how great Jack's Deli is from dozens of people.  Took a huge group there and was not disappointed at all in the food.  The corned beef was phenomenal and lived up to the billing.  The rye bread complimented the sandwich perfectly.  The wait staff was super-friendly and very attentive to our large groups needs, and I thought the prices were very fair.  My only issue was the time it took to get a table, especially after seeing how many empty dirty tables were in the dining room after we were seated.  It would seem they could serve so many more people their delicious food if they could only turn their tables faster.  It still won't deter me from going back when I'm back in the area as the food and overall experience was excellent."}
{"text":"Price is outrageous.  Ordered at the counter, $11.50 for basic deli turkey on 2 slices of rye???  Very small and taste was average at best. Never will return."}
{"text":"Great service and awesome food! Don't miss the Brisket, it's delicious. Very friendly staff"}
{"text":"excuse me .. if you don't like Jack's ... you don't know deli ... from NYC top LA .. one of the best ... potato salad is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Clean, efficient, crowded and a tad costly.  Food good, large portions. Onion rings hot  and crispy.  Sandwiches large, cole slaw nice.  We will go back. Service quick even though very busy."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Jack's for years and have always had a great experience. The soups, sandwiches, smoked fish, egg creams, and half sour pickles are great. I may prefer the corn beef down on St. Clair, but overall everything else here is so well prepared, flavorful and fresh. I liked their old location for its soul, but the new space is fresh and inviting. This place is a really good value."}
{"text":"If you are lucky enough to have the chance to stop in for lunch you must drop by here! The Reuben is ah-mazing. The corned beef is stacked high enough to make you scared of heights and once you bite in, it just melts in your mouth. It is the best Reuben I have had since some of those found in some New York Deli's. 

You will get some fresh pickles as a free snack appetizer if you ask for them. I prefer the ones that are less done and much more crunchier. 

Make sure you get the Cottage Fries which are like homemade potato chips. Some of the chips were soft and I heard other customers asking for them \"well\" done. I will try that the next time. 

The Service was really great also."}
{"text":"Been going to Jacks's forever. Corky and Lenny who? Jack's Deli, when my friend Linda comes in from Columbus is where she always asks to go because as she told me again this evening you cannot get this (as she held the Reuben masterpiece from Jack's in her hands)  there. I have been going to Jack's for a long, long time - this location and the one around the corner before they relocated here - they really hit it out of the ballpark tonight. The waitress informed us as we sat down it was Tuesday Corned Beef Night. Which means all the corned beef sandwiches and dinners are at a special price and how about a monster Reuben for $9.50. Yep you read that right $9.50. And we're talking all the bells and whistles boys and girls, including marble rye. This sandwich was a thing of true beauty! Thank you Jack's for getting it more right than you have ever gotten it wrong and have the most consistency delicious and lip smacking Deli around and that's including NYC because truth be told Cleveland's Deli really does more than rival NYC's Deli. Okay gauntlet laid down. If you have been to Jack's before and something just didn't quite feel right - maybe a crusty waitress or a sticky floor -- trust me the place deserves a second and in my opinion, yes even a third or fourth chance because when they hit a bulls-eye (which in my experience they hit quite often) it's the best you're ever going to taste. Tonight's Reuben was a shooting star and I thank you for it from both myself and Linda. The cottage fries were also to die for. Jewish Deli second to none!"}
{"text":"Friendly, family restaurant. Owners work in the store and make a point to make everyone feel welcome. Tasty food and good attitudes all around here."}
{"text":"I go there for breakfast and get the corned beef hash. The portion size is generous and the flavor is great!"}
{"text":"We moved to Phoenix AZ in 2003 and always looked forward to visiting Jack's Deli when we visited. We were there last month and found the food was very bland. The Matzo Balls had 0 taste. I've been eating and making them all my life and they definitely need a new recipe. My husband had a corned beef sandwich and had to ask for more but had to ask for more bread because the slices were so thin. Sadly, we won't return when we visit. I also wish I would have read the prior reviews that they have 10 health code violations. Never again."}
{"text":"The best, no frills deli ever. I have been wanting to get to Jack's and finally got around to it and had my first Nova Lox Bagel ever!! It was fabulous and I cannot wait to get it again. The bagel was the perfect texture & not too soft with just the right ratio of cream cheese to lox. The onion really topped it off and wasn't overpowering. My fiancee got the corn beef sandwich and it was literally perfection. The corn beef was thinly sliced, piled high, so easy to chew and the most tender corn beef I have ever tasted. I ate at the infamous Katz's in NYC over the Summer and I can say without a doubt that Jack's has an edge--both service and food!!!!"}
{"text":"First off, this place has some of the best deli meats I have ever had.  That being said, the sandwiches were good but really nothing special.  The bread was very fresh, the meat was delicious, but that's really all the sandwich had going for it.  Basically, a tower of good deli meat between 2 slices of bread, a little leaf of iceberg lettuce, and a slice of tomato.  A sandwich needs a bit more than that for some flavor.  It was a good simple sandwich with a very high price tag.  $10.45 for a sandwich that only comes with a small side of potato salad or cole slaw is a bit ridiculous.  In order to substitute fries or onion rings, it's an extra $2.  I was very excited to see that they have pea soup, but it didn't have anything in it so I'm not sure if someone just failed to stir it up and all the carrots, potatoes, etc. had settled to the bottom of the pot?  Besides that, the soup tasted good.  The restaurant is large, relatively clean, and has diner-type seating but needs some updates.  I love how the deli items are fresh and how it's more a family run place, rather than a chain.  My biggest reason for the 3 stars has to be the prices.  The amount of food, uniqueness, and atmosphere doesn't match the prices on the menu.  If I had looked on the menu and saw a sandwich for $7.50, I would think that would be a lot more realistic."}
{"text":"By chance, I tried this place out today. (Noticed it when going to Swensons,and skipped Swensons cause it was crowded)

The restaurant was clean and well lit. Employees were happy and upbeat. I had the best server ever! I had a refill on my beverage before it even made it half empty. Recommendations for appetizers and meals when I was deciding between items. The food came out hot and fresh. I didn't wait long for the food to arrive. He checked to make sure everything was delicious and if we needed anything. We even had boxes and bags before asking! Such a great guy! I'll get to Swensons another day. Today, I'm glad I had some onion rings and beef brisket. Sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Every sorta Jewish food you could want is found at Jacks. I came right in (well, we had to wait a couple minutes to be seated cause it was so busy) and had some Matzoball soup and stuffed cabbage. The soup was great. It was a bright yellow color and hit the spot, I would have liked to see some carrots in it but otherwise it was great. The stuffed cabbage was disappointing the sauce was salty not sweet like I expected. The pickles were great though. I wish there were some Jewish Deli's like Jack's in Richmond, VA  where I live. Man, I'm jealous."}
{"text":"Wow this is a GREAT deli. I tried the corned beef sandwich and it was perfect. Simple and delicious and they will make it extra lean if you ask. 

My friend ordered a hot pastrami sandwich which was devoured so fast that I didn't even get a chance to try a bite. Apparently it was that good. 

We'll be back."}
{"text":"I grew up on Jacks Deli have not been back to Cleveland in a few years. I was so disappointed they did not even no how to do a hot tongue sandwich. They fried the tongue . They did not steam it. My daughter ordered matzo brie. The eggs were runny matzo was not even cooked . Terrible experience go to Corky and Lennys for good deli."}
{"text":"Always great food and service! Every time I'm back home I stop at Jack's several times!!"}
{"text":"Jacks gets great reviews from the locals by word of mouth. Cleveland is known to be the corned beef capital of the Midwest. I stop in often. Corned beef sandwich is big-not the biggest I've ever had and not enough to warrant the 12 dollars I paid for it-but still plenty ample. I like the slaw alot. The sandwich itself was good and satisfying. Their cabbage soup is delicious. Fish sandwich is big and satisfying. Desserts are huge. Big enough for two.  Service is consistently very good. Location is near busy Cedar and Green roads. They do a busy lunch and you can order from the deli if you're on the go. Soups are great. Good atmosphere and very clean. Ask for pickles if you want them. They don't come standard. There are no extras. Did I mention breakfast? Jacks is one of the best places in town for breakfast. I recommend it."}
{"text":"Eagerly I raise my rating of Jack's. My most recent visit was so far removed from the previous few that I would feel bad not updating this deli. First the service could not have been better. An older woman speaking with an accent was polite and efficient. She really knew how to time her trips to my table. She erased the bad memories of previous servers. 

I already knew I do not like my deli usuals of a Reuben and matzoh ball soup at Jack's so I ordered a brisket on rye. The beef was well flavored, lean and cut thick enough that it gave the sandwich a hefty quality. The bread had a chewy crust, a soft interior and a pleasant sour rye taste. The potato salad is not award winning but it was okay. I am happy that I had the sense to try something new. While New Yorkers do not admit it, the number of their delis has dwindled to a handful. In  our town we still have some of the best delis and they endure."}
{"text":"If you see any 2 or 3 star reviews look at what they ordered at a deli like this. Clearly the matzah ball soup, all of their deli meats, their Rueben, potato pancakes, and challah French toast are amazing.  I am sure I am in the minority but I think Jack's is better than Slymans in regards to Cleveland delis."}
{"text":"Where do I start. They have great fries, that's always important. I thought I'd order something light on lunch so I got a tuna melt. This thing was huge. It was served open face and it was loaded. It could use a little less mayo but in general it was a really good tuna sandwich, I had lunch for the next day as well."}
{"text":"I kind of stumbled upon Jack's while in the area for the first time on business and just hungrily browsing Yelp. What a pleasant surprise! 

If you like traditional Jewish delis, this is your place. From the deli counter, to the no-nonsense \"Brooklyn\"-type staff and all the old biddies sitting in the dining room kvetching with their mumbling husbands, its like you're in a Woody Allen flick or Seinfeld episode! 

Atmosphere aside, the food is where this is at and their holy trinity (Corned Beef, Pastrami, Brisket) are legit. I had Jack's featured Brisket dip sandwich, and devoured it in a huge sloppy mess. 

Last tidbit that highlights the mom 'n pop style of the place: I dined in late in the evening and the staff were on a break, so a manager (I'm assuming) named Steve treated me to a sample of this killer deli desert and sat me in the dining room. I had to wait eagerly about 10 mins to flag down a young waitress who seemed to be tending to a few other tables. I didn't blame her for not knowing I was waiting since she didn't seat me, and the manager was all over the place. Low and behold, without me voicing any complaint, the guy \"Steve\" comes over at the end of my meal and hands me a full $8-10 value block of the sweet sesame desert bar and said \"its on me, sorry for waiting so long\". What a guy! I had asked the waitress to add one of the bars for me to my bill along with a carryout sandwich, and Steve graciously went above and beyond in service. 

What a mensch!"}
{"text":"This is sometimes my go to place for lazy Sundays. I haven't been here in a few months and I do not know why; I missed it. 

I would suggest you avoid happy hour on Sundays which is 11 a.m.-12 p.m. Because the line is out of the door but the food is great (big portions) and the prices are reasonable. They serve pickles before your meal and it's something I often look forward to. 

I always order their challah french toast and an omelet, I'm happy to say I've never been disappointed. The staff is friendly and efficient; I just love it here."}
{"text":"love this place! been coming here for years and it always satisfies. i love the complimentary pickles. the portions are huge- especially the salads! staff always seems nice, too. the matzoh ball soup is a staple when someone is sick in my house. great deli in the cleveland area."}
{"text":"We came to Jack's Deli on a busy weekend morning. Waits were long and service was really poor. 

Our server quickly took our order and left, came back with the food and disappeared. Well, disappeared is the wrong word, she seemed overly busy with several large tables and never once returned to ours. We waited several minutes and hoped that we could catch her eye, but instead just jumped up and started wandering around to other tables to ask if they were finished with their condiments.

For a breakfast place, you would there would be staples on all tables - silverware, ketchup, syrup, etc. Or that you'd be able to flag down a server in a reasonable amount of time to get what you needed. But I guess this places takes a DIY approach. I only mentioned this, because if you do come here, make sure to get up from your table immediately. Breakfast food gets cold fast and decreases in quality as it does.

Or maybe, just at this restaurant, because it is extremely drafty. We left our coats on, and so did most of the other patrons.

The food was decidedly \"OK\" and seemed to be cooked adequately. Portions are fairly big and the menu is expansive.

My other complaint is that  instead of having someone come clear a table and carry those dishes into the back room, they just push a cart filled with dirty dishes and food scraps around the dining room and clear off each table, sometimes right next to your table.Since the tables are so close, you can get a really good view of what menu items are popular based on what other patron's have left on their dirty plates.

Not recommended."}
{"text":"First time ever ordered anything from Jack's and I was well satisfied with the corn beef sandwich that I ordered from their online menu. Will be back!  5 stars!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness. I usually come for the Tuesday Corned beef special.  I have yet to be disappointed.  My only thing is the pickles. They have traditional pickles and pickles that taste homemade. The homemade pickles aren't my cup of tea but who eats a great deli sandwich without a pickle?  I highly recommend this diner for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, and our experiences have generally been good.  Breakfast is a step above the lunch/dinner menu, IMO.  For example, recently got the corned beef hash special (generous helping of corned beef hash, choice of potato and bread) for $6.25 - it was outstanding.  Their version of a Reuben, called the New Yorker, is pretty good, but not the best Reuben I've had in Cleveland.

I will say that the regular menu items are pricy.  They even charge $2.25 for a fountain beverage, which must add to the New York City feel of the place.  To be fair, they do offer free refills, so just make sure you get 3 or 4 refills to make it worth your money.

Lastly, the service also has a very NYC-vibe to it, and some of the waitresses have been here for years.  My guess is this is the kind of place you get treated very well if you come regularly."}
{"text":"All around terrific comfort food. The turkey sandwich is amazing here, ask for extra gravy.. you'll thank me later. The pastrami and corned beef was pretty amazing as well."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast and had an egg, bacon and cheese sandwich on gluten free bread. That's hard to find, especially decent tasting! Lots of food for a great price. They also have a Deli counter with meat, different kinds of prepared food like egg salad. I'd like to go back and get some Deli to go. Great service as well! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great, no frills corned beef sandwich on fresh Challah!  Absolutely delicious!   The matzah ball soup was very tasty, but corned beef was the star! Well worth a visit"}
{"text":"What a great place to meet long standing friends.  The deli atmosphere is just perfect and Jack's had the drink and food my friends and I grow up with and almost never enjoy anymore. The chocolate phosphate was just the right amount of chocolate and fizzy phosphate.  The tongue( yes, we all grew up with that) sandwich was the perfect size---enormous and the meet was lean.  The hash browns were just that, Brown and crisp.  Thoroughly enjoyed hanging out there and the service staff realized we needed our space for hours to catch up and left us alone."}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING!!!!! I am a huge fan of breakfast at any time and their breakfasts never disappoint!!! I have been going here for years and have always had a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"Came here with my mother and two brothers for a late morning breakfast on her day off. We ordered pancakes, a waffle, a bowl of soup and an omelette. 25 minutes later, the food came - thankfully the pancake and waffle were easy enough to make, because my omelette was incredibly dry and barely edible, so I asked for some hot sauce to mitigate the arid nature of this overcooked pile of eggs, ham, spinach, mushrooms, and just a small amount of cheddar cheese. I'll never come back here again, especially considering the bevy of good choices in Cleveland now for a quality meal. Proceed with caution unless you have exceptionally low standards or like firm, dry omelettes and servers stretched far too thin."}
{"text":"First off, I wish I could bottle the smell of this deli into a candle. It smells like wonderful fresh bread every time I walk in. 

The matzoh ball soup is THE BEST. Better than any deli in New York. You can tell that the broth is made from real chicken - it doesn't taste overly salty like most other chicken soup broths. The matzoh ball is perfectly fluffy.

I love everything about this place. All the food is great and it feels very homey and cozy every time I come. The owners are very helpful (they helped me to freeze some matzoh ball soup to take on a plane, saving me about $50 on shipping over dry ice). 

I would definitely recommend Jacks if you are looking for a great deli meal!"}
{"text":"This review is based entirely on service...because we didn't make it past the front entrance. So I called ahead to ask about kosher for Passover foods. I was told they had items on the menu, so we went over. To my disappointment, when we got there, the server told us they didn't have kosher for Passover items specifically but kosher food. And we couldn't order certain items because the kitchen was closed. It was a huge letdown. And they were kinda rude about the whole thing which was an added annoyance."}
{"text":"This is a go to and must have when I am in the area.  People are always friendly, food is consistently wonderful.  Always a good following.  Wish it was bigger though had to wait for a short time and when we left the line was out the door.  Corned beef sandwich and matzo ball soup. Soul food for a cold day!!!"}
{"text":"The first time I visited Jack's I was very impressed by the selection and quality of the food.  I had the Nova Scotia Platter, which is smoked salmon, cream cheese, tomato, onion, and a bagel.  It was awesome!

However, the second time I visited, I had ordered the same Nova Scotia Platter online and I ended up having to wait at the restaurant (which was not very busy) while they made my order because they hadn't even started it by the time I arrived. Also, in the rush to get my order out, they left off the cream cheese in my order, which I didn't realize until I was back at home. Normally, something like that wouldn't bother me, but the cream cheese is what makes a lox and bagel so I was a little disappointed.  

I'm going to chalk up my bad experience to the fact that the online ordering service is still new and they're working out the kinks still.  I'll be returning for sure... but maybe to dine in next time."}
{"text":"What's a newly relocated, raised in Boca shiksa whose all alone on Easter to do? Eat a reuben silly. Overall, the place could use a facelift, the deli section looked a bit sad. The line was long and the hostess? had the personality of a turnip. That all said - the service was great, pickles crisp and Reuben delicious."}
{"text":"$20/pound?  Pretty sure even NYC Times Square wouldn't stand for that!

Charged us $35 for 1.5 pound of corned beef.   What, the what what?

Meat as Ok, but comparable to $6/pound grocery store corned beef.  

Not a chance of return."}
{"text":"This place is great! They give you free pickles, and the manager (owner?) is always super friendly. I've had several sandwiches here - the corned beef and the brisket \"French dip\" type of sandwich are delicious, but I honestly think my favorite thing is the cabbage rolls. They are just like my grandma used to make! Soooo good! They have a tomato sauce covering cabbage leaves that are stuffed with a meat (ground beef) and rice mixture. I got it with mashed potatoes and vegetable. They also give you bread. It's a lot of food! Definitely worth the trip. Oh - and with online ordering and pickup, it's super convenient!  They have these little chocolate or white frosted cakes by the register that are delicious too - try one next time. They are yummy!"}
{"text":"Horrible over priced food for a \"deli\". Ordered a veggie burger that was a bland previously frozen patty that came with generic crinkle fries.  Towards end of meal found hair in food. So gross, save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Not much to complain about. Our server was a bit overwhelmed by our large group and had no idea what beers they had. And the lox that's served with latkes looked a bit sparse. And the latkes look too regular in shape to be home-made (though I wouldn't doubt that they are). 

Overall, great food, excellent quantities. The corned beef with potato pancakes (\"Jared's Fressers Delight\") and mushroom barley soup (a bit on the salty side) are highly recommended. They were nice enough to have several staff come out & sing to our birthday boy, and we got to see a girl eat a piece of cheesecake as big as her head."}
{"text":"Just wanted to say that I have been a customer of Jacks Deli for over a year now, I go frequently, my favorite is the build your own omelet, but I have had other things such as the corned beef sandwich as well and it is awesome. The food is always tasty, fresh and at a  great price. The front attendant/cashier Markita ( not sure if I spelled her name correctly)  is the sweetest young lady. She is so friendly and remembers what I like to order. It's nice to walk in and be greeted by her beautiful smile. She is a great representative/employee for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Jacks does breakfast and lunch the way you like it. Selections from the menu cover the gamut for all tastes. We come here as often as we can. The staff is friendly and helpful. Great place to explore new tastes. The thick rye toast is worth the up charge and trip."}
{"text":"Jack's is everything a Deli should be and more! 

As you walk in, there is a meat counter to order deli cuts to go. To the right is a dessert case showing off all the decadent delights. I was sold even before I sat down to look over the menu.

On a recent visit, I came in for an early dinner. Everything on the menu looked fantastic. The soups, salads, sandwiches and platters offered consisted of everything I could've imagined from a proper Deli. 

Potato Pancakes, check. Motzah Ball Soup, check. Lox and Bagels, check. Salads of every variety including Wedge, Cobb, Egg, Potato, Macaroni, check. Corned Beef, Pastrami, Smoked Turkey, Bologna, Rare Roast Beef, check. Fries with Gravy, check. Jumbo Hot Dogs, grilled or boiled, check. Burgers, Patty Melts, Tuna Melts, check. Corned Beef and Cabbage, Homemade Meatloaf, Stuffed Cabbage, Chicken Schnitzel, check. And that's just a fraction of the lunch/dinner offerings! Where to begin?! Oh my.....

The meal started with a plate of pickles. I have a theory in which every deli can be judged by and that's their pickles. If a deli has good pickles, the rest of the meal should be good as well. With each bite of this precious little pickled cucumber, you will be able to tell just how much time and effort was put into what some consider an afterthought to the main course. Needless to say, Jack's passed the pickle test. 

For dinner, I ordered the Motzah Ball Soup and Reuben Sandwich. Both were phenomenal, especially the Reuben. This massive paring of lean, shaved corned beef, sauerkraut and swiss is definitely in my top 5 Reuben's of all time. 

I certainly can't wait to come back. There's so much more on the menu I've got to try, including the breakfast!"}
{"text":"I can't say that Jack's Deli is my favorite place, but it's pretty good and it's consistent (at least in my experience, but hey, isn't that what Yelp is all about?). One of my best friends lives by here, and he swears by their Reuben. If he is feeling down, this place is where I take him. 

Typically we got there for lunch, and on Friday we both needed something tasty so we hit up Jack's. J got the Reuben (of course). The server usually brings their house made pickles, but I can't comment on them as (gasp!) I despise pickles. However, my other friends usually ask for seconds, so they must not be awful. The Reuben is a nicely sized sandwich, and always hits the spot for him. I'm a huge fan of their potato knish. Nah, it's not a culinary masterpiece or anything, but it's good. It's truly some of my favorite comfort food - give me a potato knish with gravy and a bowl of soup. Their Matzo balls are giant, and the broth is tasty. When I get the Matzo ball soup (a cup comes with one ball), you literally get a Matzo ball and broth. No carrots or any of that stuff you may typically find. However, I find it is really tasty without. 

I love their lox - I had out of town guests and I had them bring bagels (they were travelling from New York, and sorry Cleveland Bagel Co, I still prefer New York!) so I picked up some lox from Jack's. They loved it! I haven't tried out their deli for anything else, but they seem busy."}
{"text":"I love and hate Jacks. I love the food, but the service is not very good, but this is a Delicatessen after all. The recent remodel is very nice. All this being said I still eat here at least once a month. If you work in South Euclid you should definitely by eating here!"}
{"text":"A classic Jewish deli. Hope you are prepared to leave full! 

Liverwurst sandwich was huge and tasty, but I wouldn't call it the best I've ever had. Although prepared very well, the liverwurst itself lacked flavor."}
{"text":"Perfectly respectable Kosher-style deli in Cleveland. Delicious corned beef and the place was clean (unlike Corky's). If you're in the mood for deli this is a fine choice."}
{"text":"Ate here last night with my aunt and uncle while doing business in area. Highly recommend 

Had the Ruben which was 7 thumbs up and a snap. 

Had pickled tomatoes and peppers. Wow to say the least.

Had a great beer by HE'BREW there as well.  

Honestly our waitress was horrible but the food made up for her. If they could only get the waitress with the green  tints in her hair to do her job it would be 6 stars. Guess that shows how much good food means.

Love this kosher deli!!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delectable!!!!  This is good, solid, scrumptious Jewish-style deli!!!  As someone who has been to The Rascal House, Ratners, The Stage, The Carnegie, Canter's, Jerry's, and numerous other wonderful dens of Kosher-style deliciousness, I feel that I can say with some authority that Jack's ranks up with the best of them!!!

To be fair, I haven't tried everything on the menu, but what I HAVE had has all been exactly what my taste buds were crying out for:

The corned beef is so beautiful, it'll make your mama kvell!!!  Juicy, succulent, full of wonderful flavor, stacked tall upon rye bread...sigh.  Why can't my hometown have a deli like this????

The tongue sandwich makes my mouth so explosively happy!!!  I realize that some people are squigged out by the notion of dining on this particular meat, but oh!!  It is divine!!!  And unlike many other delis I've been to in my life, this tongue is served warm, delicate, moist, perfect!!  So much flavor, so tender, not tough or chewy!

The cheese blintzes are so yummy, even though it's really gilding the lily to get them when we're also getting sandwiches, my partner and I can't help but get an order and share them!  Rich, buttery, a little crispy on the outside, gooey and sweet on the inside, so good!!  

The potato pancakes are crispy, flavorful, and HUGE!!  Served with the usual applesauce or sour cream, you can't lose with these!  And if you want to share these more as an appetizer with a group, they also have them in \"mini\" sizes!

The kosher dill and half-dill pickles are plunked down on the table, gratis, before you even order...mmmm!!!  Crispy, crunchy half-dills are my favorites!!  I can't resist!!!

There are a few less-than-desireable things about Jack's, don't get me wrong:  First, I wish they put a bottle of Gulden's Spicy Brown mustard on the table...instead, they just have the usual yellow stuff...if you like the spicy mustard, you have to ask...and they bring you a tiny squirt of some brand-x-tasting stuff in a minute sauce cup.  Come on, give me the REAL stuff!!!  And let me lay it on thick, the way I like it!!

I don't recommend the brownies.  It's unlikely that you came here for brownies, but on the off-chance that you did, they are expensive, overly-sugary, and have absorbed the flavor of the deli, so tasted a little bit like pickles to me!  Next time I'm at Jack's, I'll probably try the cheesecake instead (on the remote chance I still have room after my tongue sandwich!)!!

Last, this restaurant really has no ambiance, and the waitresses can be a little surly...so this is not a date restaurant, unless your date could care less about ambiance and just wants a mouthful of delicious food at reasonable prices!!  But it's a good \"family\" restaurant, can accomodate larger groups, and if you're in a hurry, you need go no further than the front lobby, where you can get your sandwich (which comes with a pickle and potato salad) to-go quickly!!

Whenever I'm in the Cleveland area, this is ALWAYS on my list of scheduled stops...in fact, we always bring a couple of pounds of corned beef home with us on the plane!!!  You can only IMAGINE how heavenly our luggage smells when we unpack :)"}
{"text":"I wish I could give more stars, but last night's visit left me so disappointed. It took our server close to ten minutes to come to our table, and instead of introducing herself when she finally showed up, she asked if we were ready to order. As we were waiting for our food, another server was talking to a single man at the table next to us who was obviously a regular, and complaining about work and dating - so incredibly unprofessional!! The chicken schnitzel was just OK - the mashed potatoes tasted just like instants out of a box. My guest had the turkey sandwich and it wasn't anything special. Our drinks sat empty and it took a while to get the attention of someone to bring us to go boxes. Maybe it was a bad night, but the restaurant wasn't even remotely busy. Service was terrible and it makes me second guess coming back. If and when I do, I'll stick to a deli sandwich."}
{"text":"Great food but they definitely don't pride themselves on customer service . Always get take out and it's always a hassle . Don't call too early in the morning for breakfast , they aren't even awake yet. Good corn beef just gotta be patient if you are used to good customer service."}
{"text":"First time here we tried the pastrami on challah bread it was amazing!! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I cannot love this place more. Gary, you have yourself a wonderful thing! I am so very grateful for you and your employees understanding my dietary needs. As a celiac, traveling on a Sunday through towns where there are no chains and not many places that are GFF are open, you are a God send. 

Gary, the owner, knows what's up when it comes to what is gluten-free and what isn't. And so much is!!! 

I ordered an absolutely delicious Reuben. There seemed to be an issue with the possibility of the creamy cole slaw and the potato salad containing gluten, so he brought me a vinegar slaw. One look at my sandwich and I was let down. They obviously didn't bring me gluten free bread. There was just no way. It had seeds in it! It looked normal! But Gary promised and I trusted him and it was FABULOUS. I wanted to CRY. 

We were brought pickles and although I felt like the brighter, younger pickle-type was too salty and strong (tasted like I got a mouthful of California ocean when I bit down), the older pickle was to die for. 

I bought a loaf of the GF bread and a jar of pickles to take with me on our journey.

Our server was amazing. She was funny and nice and very informative. She even told a few jokes. I love Jewish delis :) The ladies at the register and the guy behind the counter slicing up meat were also helpful and kind. 

The rest of my family (ordered breakfast- corned beef hash among other items), moaned through their meal. A quick run to the bathroom gave me a tour of other diner's plates and I fell in love with the view. 

It's been about 10 and a half hours since I ate there and I am not sick. This is a success! 

I wouldn't think twice about stopping here again if we are ever driving through. Gary, I love you and will dream about you making me sandwiches tonight. :)"}
{"text":"Oy Vey! This place will knock your socks off. Hearty Deli fare. Sandwiches to die for. Big breakfasts and a take out counter. Be prepared to wait a bit because this place is so popular, they pack 'Em in.  Great corned beef, huge omelettes. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Casual diner style seating with attentive service and knowledgeable staff. You feel like your in Bubala's kitchen."}
{"text":"1 star for the horrendous service and unequal treatment of customers.

I've been here a handful of times now but after today, I will not be coming back. Don't get me wrong, the food is generally good. However, the service is horrible. 

NOT ALL CUSTOMERS ARE TREATED THE SAME. Only once did we get offered their complementary pickles while other tables around us got multiple plates of pickles. Today, specifically, we were not served water or pickles while the EMPTY table next to us had 5 waters and 1 plate of pickles. When \"the VIP party\" finally sat down at this other table, 2 more plates of pickles were brought to their table. I don't mean to make a fuss about pickles and water (I don't even like pickles) but it would have made more sense for them to take care of customers that are already at the restaurant first instead of ones who were still on their way.

Further, we've gotten dirty silverware several times now. Today was the worst because we had 3 people at our table and each 1 had AT LEAST 1 DIRTY UTENTSIL handed to us. Yes, the waiter was handing out the utensils as we were sitting there and didn't notice the food that were stuck on these utensils so we had to tell him \"this _____ is dirty, can we get another one?\" This happened 3 times. Talk about awkward.

As if these weren't enough, the waitress while serving our food slammed my friend's plate on the table causing sauce to splatter on his jacket. NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND OF COURSE NO APOLOGY FOLLOWED."}
{"text":"I gave it a four just because it's expensive. Sometimes you have to pay more if you want quality. Every single thing we had was wonderful. I love half sour pickles and they were just perfect. This means they are more salty than sour. The blueberry and the cheese blintzes and the corn beef and the roast beef and the halvah were fantastic! The roast beef just melted in my mouth. That's the only way that I can describe it."}
{"text":"hot brisket sandwich with swiss & horseradish on the side .. IS 'DA BOMB! .."}
{"text":"Our favorite deli in Cleveland. great food and great service. There are the typical Jewish deli. They have an array of lunch meat sandwiches with enough meat for two sandwiches. The soup is great. I tend to get matzo ball, but have switched to the hearty chicken noodle. Add a matzo ball and you have a yourself a meal. The fries are good and they have cottage fries, which are basically homemade thick potato chips. and you cant forget the pickles. They will bring all the pickles you want to the table!"}
{"text":"As deli's go Jack's is A-OK. They do the basics well - as good as their competition. Service is good to but not excellent. Waitresses have a habit of not making eye contact with their tables to see if everything is okay. You might sit for a while trying to get their attention. If you are in the area GO - but I wouldn't drive out of my way to go their as Cleveland has a wealth of good deli's around town that are just as good if not better."}
{"text":"Good food but overpriced and the service is awful.  I stood in waiting for 3 minutes without any acknowledgement (be with you shortly).  I thought I was in the wrong line so i asked the cashier for what I wanted.  I understand the person behind the counter was working but good customer service will say \"I will be with you shortly\".  Then the prices were way higher than any other comparable deli in its class."}
{"text":"We frequent this place often. We have tried just about everything. IT IS ALL EXCELLENT and authentic deli food. I love the bright green fresh pickles but the vinegar brined are also good. The sandwiches are piled high with lean meat. The egg and tuna salad are tasty. Breakfast is a delight. Homemade challah French toast?  Yes please. Nova lox and bagels?  Yum. This place is the real deal. Eat here."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and wow. Great service,  great food and coming back again. We drive an hour and a half from wooster to come up here. Too bad  we don't have anything like this near us. Love this place."}
{"text":"You kiss the sandwich
It kisses you back, with tongue,
pickles, and mustard.



Love it.  This place could be a cartoon.  One of the few places in Cleve that you can get a decent tongue sandwich.  Nice deli too!  A half loaf of (still warm) jewish rye, pickles, smoked fish....  oy...I got the shpilkas...

Carry on..."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! I went with a group of friends for dinner, we all started with the potato pancakes. They were fried to perfection and served with sour cream and apple sauce. I couldn't keep my hands away from then. For main course I had the New Yorker with potato salad. Being from NYC area, I been missing a lot of my hometown staples and this helped. Get ready to get messy its a big sandwich. Ended with some cheesecake which is heavenly, definitely a place I will be returning to. Interior is clean, staff is friendly and knowledge, and prices are decent."}
{"text":"Food is great but I'd visit more often if my order wasn't wrong EVERY SINGLE TIME. Our office's favorite is the Chicken Tortilla Salad. It's fantastic!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience here!!! The staff is always friendly!!! Food is always great plus they offer breakfast all day!!! Never have to wait long for the food either, no matter how busy it may be!!! And they offer reasonable prices!!! An overall great restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Jack's currently needs some serious attention to their tables and chairs...tables are wobbly, booths are cracked in some places/dirty.  The high chair was dirty.  This place needs to repair some things, it makes the place look run-down. We all had to clean off our chairs before sitting (crumbs).  Not a big deal, but as I looked around, I noticed all the seating needed attention.

The food was pricey....prices have gone up quite a bit, actually.  

Anyway, our omlettes were perfect, toast perfect, kid's meal perfect.  The food was great.  

Cons: bussing of the tables is odd, noisy and distracting now.  You're eating, and a busser pulls up next to you in a cart and starts slamming dishes/ uneaten food into it...it's pretty gross to see that, with dirty aprons on them, and stuff, while you're eating.  And it's loud!
Another con is: there are waaaaaay too many tables crammed into this place, it's seriously packed and difficult to navigate without having to excuse yourself to at least three people."}
{"text":"Hmmm...I was hoping for more. Went to Jack's for the fist time a couple of weeks back when some family was in town. At our table we had a little of everything - burger, open faced hot turkey with gravy and mashed potatoes, and I had a pastrami sandwich. 

Now, I was really pumped about my pastrami - wondering if this could possibly rival that pastrami god, Mr. Brisket. No, no it did not. The meat had decent flavor, but it was very stringy and fatty - way more so than others I've had. Also, the sandwich was pretty small compared to other delis' offerings. 

The others at the table all gave A-ok reviews of their meals. Nothing outstanding with my first experience here. I'll go back at least one more time - got the Groupon from a few weeks back to use...so we'll see. For now, 3's all I got for ya."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and really enjoyed it, especially since they had the full menu at 9am (not just bfast) which is perfect post a night shift! We were definitely the rowdy bunch on a Wednesday AM amongst a group of bookclubs, but staff was great and didn't judge our early alcohol intake. 
I got a bloody Mary, pricier than expected but made really well!
I tried the lox and latkas (lunch menu) which were pretty good and I'd def get again. The rest of the bfast menu was average, but better/healthier than your typical bfast food."}
{"text":"Jack's has been competing with it's evil arch rival Corky and Lenny's for years. Both have either remodeled or moved in recent years. Both have lost their original owners to sickness or death. One has stood tall and kept what the original owner had. This is Jack's. Jack's move and remodel took nothing away from what it once was. A larger space allowed more customers and a larger deli and pastry section which Jack's was lacking compared to Corky's taking up half it's restaurant. The servers still are knowledgeable with Sass. The food while not amazing stands firm and consistent. Though the original owner may have had a reputation as being a grouch his restaurant stands tall in the battle with Corky's. The people who chose Corky's over Jack's have obviously not yet received the obligatory once in at least one lifetime food poisoning from Corky's. Just wait it will happen."}
{"text":"Jacks is great. I'm often critical of the food in this part of the country but damn, a good deli is true Yankee barbecue. The corned beef hash was awesome, and so was the sandwich. Excellent pastrami as well. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Nice after remodel....food same jacks you've come to love.  Nice airy feeling now. Servers seem happier too."}
{"text":"Great place to go for Challah French toast and super friendly service"}
{"text":"I went with the special of the day for lunch the rueben sandwich. it came with sauerkraut, thousand island sauce, and pickles.  BIG portions and pretty good sandwich. Nice little deli located in a small strip mall in Beechwood they offer all kind of things as you would expect from this type of deli. I like it bc it wasn't one of those franchise places. but good place to chat, have food and hang out."}
{"text":"My favorite Jewish Deli of all time!  I have been coming to JACKS (including the old location)  for over 30 years.  The corned beef sandwich is the best I have ever eaten- Even above Katz's and Carnegie in NY.  I always have to get some corned beef to take home.  The pickles are also the best ever- little garlic and lots of great taste.  The cole slaw, Burgers and brisket are also fantastic.  Gary and Andrea are great owners.  This has my highest recommendation!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast and friendly staff!!
Always seated quickly and food comes out hot!!
The Create your own Omelet can be overwhelming if you add too much!!"}
{"text":"Easily the best hot pastrami sandwich I've every had!
A little pricey though (~$10 for a small, but loaded, reuben), but absolutely worth it when you've got that craving....
You can also buy their meats and cheeses from the deli in the front of the restaurant.
Very friendly waiters and staff."}
{"text":"Best deli in any state!  Pictures are worth a thousand words, look at those sandwiches!!!!!"}
{"text":"I grew up on Deli in NY, so that is my basis for comparison.  I ordered the corned beef on rye along with requesting deli mustard (why there is \"ballpark\" yellow mustard on the table is beyond me.)
I found the corned beef dry (not succulent) , lacking in taste, and extremely salty. In other words, it was not properly cooked."}
{"text":"Was in need of a sandwich as long as my face... so after reading yelpers report, there we went! Apparently they have a new menu, and boy is it extensive! Kinda weird they charge extra for lettuce or tomato or onions for your sandwich. 
I had ordered the New Yorker with corn beef and beef borsch. The heart stopping sandwich was delicious and the borsch would have been better if it was warm soup, instead of cold soup. 
This place has an amazing following, one table had an overweight male with a respirator chowing down his food and gasping for air and at another table, the waitress placed a halfway folded white apron around an obese man's neck, as if it was a bib!  Jack's food has that affect on me too...channeling my inner fat boy!"}
{"text":"The east and west dichotomy is real. East side has a few Jewish delis. The west side has a few Arab delis. I am not too familiar with Jewish delis. I wish there were some on the west side. I thought Jack's was great and definitely worth the long drive down Cedar. The corned beef was excellent. The breakfast food is also fantastic. You can make your own omelet and add whatever you like. Meat is a dollar to add and veggies are fifty cents. I added avocado and it made a good omelet filling. The lox were also good. I ended up meeting up with my friend at Edgewater Park and went into food paralysis for a couple hours."}
{"text":"I have a mixed review for jack's deli.  

Food: 3.8/5 
Pretty good sandwich with decent fries. The appetizer portion of the stuffed cabbage was very good. 

Value:  3/5

$15 before tax and tip for an average size sandwich with fries. I left hungry and a bit disappointed 


Service:  2/5

It was relatively empty when we arrived, but getting seated took some time due to confusion as to whose job that was. Our server took our order, brought our food, and checked back once. She wasn't friendly and didn't seem to care about refills or how our food was. We had to wait a long time for our check. 

I'll go back, but not soon."}
{"text":"With my goyish taste buds I can still appreciate their delicious matzo ball soup and turkey pastrami.

Good food and honesty are part of the charm for this eastern suburban deli spot.  I say this because when you ask the waitress how she is doing you don't expect to hear, \"All right I guess, shlepping here making a living\".  Following that if you dare ask how's your reuben you'd almost expect to hear, best sandwiches in town, and there is a good argument to be made for that."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today with a friend I was visiting.  Great food! Great service! I'm a little perplexed why the management doesn't create or enforce a cell phone rule in this place.  A woman at a booth had her laptop and cell phone in use the entire time I was there.  Another diner at an adjacent booth even asked her to get off the phone after numerous phone calls, and the rude cell phone user replied that she \"was a regular\" and had permission to \"set up her office\" in her booth. I find this hard to believe since this woman was disturbing the entire restaurant.  Wow! Cell phone etiquette needs to be addressed here."}
{"text":"I really like a good deli that you can eat at.  Jack's is a old traditional establishment (but has a fresh new look) that knows how to make people happy w. food.  Their portions are big, and they have a menu that takes fifteen minutes to wade through.  For me, it's easy.  Anything w. their corned beef.  My favorite go to is the corned beef hash breakfast special.  For $8 you get two eggs, amazing corned beef hash, your choice of potato (I always get the hashed browns) and your choice of toast.  It is so filling that it makes for a good second meal.  I like the CB hash so much I take 2 quarts of it to my in laws on Christmas day every year to add the the brunch they throw, and everyone loves it.  
My kids are big fans of the pancakes and french toast.  The menu offers many items such as burgers, dogs, old school school dinner combinations, salads and desserts. Some of these items can get a little pricey, but you have to remember, its quality AND quantity.  I used to live in the neighborhood, but now that I don't I make it a point to go back every once in a while to enjoy a great breakfast."}
{"text":"Went to Jack's on the recommendation of a friend who grew up in Cleveland Heights, and the homegirl was right--the food was good and so satisfying. Had a trio of sliders with corned beef, pastrami, and chopped liver. The serving was so big, I took it home for dinner shared with dear husband ( I noticed everyone at the checkout ahead of me had a take-home box, too.) The meats were lean, tender, sliced authentically thin, and the pastrami had just the right amount of spice. Maybe the best pastrami this side of Katz's in NYC. The chicken liver could have used more diced onion and chicken fat. And the borscht is rich with cabbage, but as sweet as cotton candy. Their grill is not just an afterthought, as son had a well-cooked burger.
My only complaint was the service. Once we were seated, the waitress was right there, took our order, and the kitchen was reasonably fast. But when we arrived, there was a line out the door to be seated. We waited for 40 minutes behind 3 parties of 6 (hey, they gotta eat, too), but when we got to the dining room, there were at least 10 empty 2-top to 4-top tables and booths. They could have easily seated the small parties, instead of making us wait in line behind the large parties. What's up with that? I thought maybe they were short staffed on wait help, but there were bussers and waitresses standing around, waiting for tables to fill up.Not the way to turn your tables! I'll go back to Jack's, but maybe not on a family-brunch Saturday."}
{"text":"As a child I was taught when you act hastily, and it may have caused a negative situation, you should make a correction asap and hope that no damage was done.  I recently wrote a review on Jacks as I had not heard anything regarding my letter I sent.   However on yesterday, I received a most heartfelt apology from Alvie, the owner of Jacks indicating that he was very sorry about the sandwich I purchased.  He acknowledged that long time customers are important to him and he did not want to lose my business.   He had been away celebrating the birth of a grandchild.   So I rescind my comment.  Please support this restaurant and it does indeed have the best cornbeef in the city.  Perhaps it was a bad day, of which we all have so I don't hold it against them.  Kudos to Alvie and it made me feel great to receive a handwritten letter and he also asked that I stop in and say Hi."}
{"text":"I grew up in Cleveland, but now live in the Columbus area. The central Ohio delis just don't stand up to what you can get in Cleveland, at least in terms of Jewish comfort food. 

I visited last weekend and ended up at Jack's before 10am. I got challah french toast, home fries and, of course, matzo ball soup. Awesome. If you get matzo ball soup, it is a bit plain- just broth and a matzo ball, but the matzo ball is really all you need. Its fairly large, soft and tastes just right. 

My hubby's not the breakfast type, so he got their BBQ brisket sandwich with fries and coleslaw. He started with a potato latke and applesauce. Yum! He really liked the sandwich- it's the second time in a row he's gotten it. The coleslaw is vinegar-based, not laden with mayo, which he appreciated. 

Jack's has just about everything you could want! From deli sandwiches to Jewish food staples, and it's all delicious! 

Beware that some of the servers aren't the friendliest, but if you can ignore that, the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Oh... where to begin.  This restaurant disappoints in so many ways.  Our server was unfriendly (though other staff was nice).  Our chicken matza ball soup had a very artificial color and taste (most likely made from cheap bullion).  The sandwiches were dry and fairly tastless... and didn't include the extras that we requested.  Surprisingly, this place gets very crowded and the wait just adds to the overall disappointment.

Sadly, good delis in Cleveland are hard to come by... especially on the east side."}
{"text":"Upon recommendation from a Cleveland-east side-native, I trekked from the west side to give Jack's a try. They have many specialties, including their fresh deli sammies, but I was craving breakfast. I had the classic eggs and lox with their house made cottage chips. Not bad! Jack's is easily the most solid breakfast place on the east side of Cleveland. 

Coffee is endless and Carmen, the server is a charmer."}
{"text":"Jack's a great place to go for Jewish-deli food. The matza ball soup hit the spot. I became addicted to the pickles and I wolfed down my corned beef sandwich on rye. The rye bread was warm and the crusts were nicely toasted crisp. All of us at the table had corned beef sandwiches so unfortunately I cannot speak more about the menu."}
{"text":"Jack's is the go-to deli in Cleveland. The owners are always there making sure they deliver quality! A great place to get trays for events! Don't pass up the chocolate phosphate and corned beef!

I consider them family!!!"}
