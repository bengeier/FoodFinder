{"text":"Poor customer service by our waitress named \"Natalie\" ruined our first time here. We ordered a few glasses of wine and a couple of appetizers. None of which were worth the price we paid. (wings + lobster dip) Took forever to even get to order which I didn't quite understand seeing as it was not a busy night and there were only a few other tables occupied. Upon ordering an appetizer I went back less than 3 MINUTUES after asking if I could change the order due to allergies at which point Natalie bluntly said \"no the order has already been put through to the kitchen\". I should have requested to speak w/ a manager about her attitude but this yelp review will have to do instead.  Will definitely NOT be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years and stopped in for a quick bite and a cold beer on this hot sweltering day. I choose the curry creamed mussels and my husband chose the fish tacos. Although both were in the starter section of the menu both portions were more than ample as a main for lunch. The curry cream sauce was deliciously flavourful with the right amount of spices and shredded pepper and carrot. Served with three slices of a toasted baguette to sop up the yummy sauce it was the perfect size. The hubby LOVED the fish tacos, grilled cat fish with a nice dry rub; 3 tacos in soft tortillas with lettuce, black beans, corn, jalapeño peppers and a cream mayo sauce. I had a taste and they were superb. Think I'll order them for myself next time! The draft beer was cold and the service was friendly, we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Port Credit. Great menu, great service. Always fresh and tasty food. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Seriously overpriced and very so-so food.  Have eaten here a lot and tried most of the menu.  Pizzas are good but VERY small and between $15-20 each.  Salads are all the same and heavy on the vinegar.  Steaks are OK.  Seafood is indifferent.  Vegetables are tedious and unoriginal.  French Fries soggy.  Wraps are good but much iceberg lettuce used to fill them out.  Drive by on garbage day and if you look around the corner you will see HUGE empty cans of the world's cheapest tomato sauce which explains the sour acidy taste of anything there with a tomato sauce.  Shrimps also either canned or the cheapest frozen kind from east Asia.  Breakfasts are expensive with an embarrasing side of canned beans (again, garbage day reveals the source).  I'm sure no one would buy this type of cheap canned goods to feed their family but this restaurant is very talented at hiding and masking the lack of quality of the main ingredients by adding lots of spices.  It's OK if you're starving and there's no place else to go.  Staff is very nice however."}
{"text":"Great selection of local/craft brews and pairing with food.  The food selection goes well beyond the typical pub fare, though there's that too.  I enjoyed my smokehouse burger, though I think the patty was a little over-cooked."}
{"text":"I have heard good things about Pump House Grille from a few people, so my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try on Friday night. It was cold and rainy, but still very busy with the NBA playoffs happening. We walked in at 6:30 PM without a reservation, but we waited only about 15 minutes before we were seated.   I did not expect to see a bigger, roomier, and nicer dining area in the back. The service was good, the staff were polite. There are also quite a few TVs, and it seems like a lot of locals were there to watch the Raptors' playoff game.  The server gave us a list of the day's specials, but we decided to stick with their menu items. We started off by ordering the Potato Skins with bacon, spring onions, and cheddar. It was decent, but nothing special.   For our mains, we tried the Seafood Diavolo and Penne Arrabbiata. Dave mentioned below that it is a good amount with leftovers, but we did not expect such BIG portions. We felt full just by looking at the size of our pastas! The Seafood Diavolo was not appealing (being saucy and orange in colour...), but the jumbo shrimps were cooked perfectly and there were chunks of lobster which were quite tasty. The creamy rosé sauce made it very filling, and it was not spicy at all. The Penne Arrabbiata looked a lot like something we used to make (too often) back in university (...with Classico sauces!). We expected to see slices of sausage but it was more like ground pork. It was more peppery, rather than spicy, hot with a kick as it should be. Unfortunately, both of the pastas were overcooked, too.  Perhaps it was an off night for the chef, or it was a new chef...but we would only dine at Pump House Grille again if we happen to be in the area. Well...we may return when they are doing their specials.  * Mondays to Fridays from 3 to 5 PM -- 59 cent wings (only until the end of April) * Wednesdays from 5:30 to 9:30 PM -- $1.50 per oyster"}
{"text":"I'm rating this a 3 but it's probably more like a 3.5 and I probably need to come back at least one more time to solidify my judgement.  Came here yesterday with a couple of friends, it was Tuesday so it was wing night.  It was pretty busy when we came (about 6:30).  The place is really big inside, bigger than you would think it is from the outside.  The decor is pretty nice and it has a patio, in general it has a really nice pub feel.  My friends both had 20 wings, I had the Pheonix and Dragon salad which was a green salad with chicken and shrimps with an asian-style sauce with chow mein noodles, and fries to share.  The salad was quite large and the shrimps were pretty big and tender.  There was lots of chicken strips in the salad and overall I thought it was good I was happy with it.  I would have been happier if one more shrimp was added to the salad as there were only 3 and the salad was 20$.  The wings my friends had were really only like 13$ and they were pretty happy with them.  The bowl of fries to share was MASSIVE, the 3 or us could not even finish them so really good value for money there and the waitress did warn us it was a big serving size.    The two hostesses at the front were too busy talking to each other on the way out and did not respond to us saying thank you/bye so they could work on their customer service a bit."}
{"text":"Long time local hang out in Port Credit. My son brought me here after he won his hockey game. Food is good and wholesome. Reasonable prices and service is Ok. Drop in without reservation and meet your friends for a good time."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, for brunch -  lunch - and dinner.  The staff is always nice and accommodating if you have a family with you including kids. My go to is the veggie burger -  they let you pick one of the other burgers on the menu and just swap it for a veggie patty. I always get the cheesy jalapeno burger, it's great. Also their Nachos are insane! They can feed 3 people as an app, well made and worth the price."}
{"text":"Pump House is a common destination for us, especially so on Mondays where wings are half price. The wings here, particularly the grilled version are quite good. Flavor favorites are Guinness BBQ, Southern Cajun and Hot & Honey. The standard Hot wings are also good as well.  Apart from wings we've had some burgers and apps which have also been good, better than normal pub fare in my opinion. The Pumphouse burger and blue cheese burger are two particular good ones that I've had before.  Beer selection is decent and the caesar has a nice bite to it.  If the patio is an option then grab a table. It's almost always quiet unless it's a rush hour Go train parking lot empty in which case you might have a line of cards beside the patio.  A nice place to grab some grub & a drink!"}
{"text":"Waitress Natalie (?) was very nice. Food terrible. Stale (supposed to be crisp) hard bacon. Eggs overdone (asked for over easy). Coffee bitter. Never again."}
{"text":"very nice place for a lunch. casual bar atmosphere and lots of food for good price"}
{"text":"I went to dinner with a group of 8 and noticed that this resto really likes to skimp on their sauces. I ordered the Cajun catfish which was much better on its own with some lemon, but was topped off with this weird pineapple melange sauce that tasted like it came from one of those fruit cups you got as a kid...Totally ruined a good fish. The basmati was also incredibly bland. The grilled vegetables ended up being the most enjoyable part of my meal, which to me is rather disappointing. The ambience is fairly nice, staff are alright, and there's enough space for medium-sized groups, but the food is below average (the non-burger plates anyways) while the prices are way inflated."}
{"text":"First and last time I'm visiting this place. My friend and I visit Port Credit often and like trying out different restaurants in the areas. Unfortunately for us we settled on this place for an afternoon lunch.   Our waitress was incredibly rude to the point where my friend and I were both confused if we had somehow offended her and wanted to apologize if we had. Looked visibly angry that she had to wait on us. Had us sit at a dirty table and when I asked if it could be wiped I had to point out to her that my side of the table was wet and I couldn't set my phone or bag down. She passively wiped it with another wet rag and walked away.   I ordered a shrimp pad thai which was very unimpressive. The shrimp was undercooked but based off her attitude I hesitated to ask her to send it back. But considering I was paying $15 I decided to send it back and not let it go to waste. When I told the waitress it tasted raw she looked at me like an idiot and sighed. She rushed away while me and my friend were left confused. She then returned with a plate for me to put my shrimp in to send back. Okay, cool but you could've told us that before you stomped off.  I requested normal un-iced water as I was sick that day and didn't want to exacerbate my symptoms. She first gave me ice water and when I asked for it to be changed she literally brought me hot water. At that point I just wanted to leave the place because from the second I sat down I was being treated horribly. She had no problem serving the elderly couples in the seats next to us so I'm not sure what her issue was besides the fact that the restaurant had no other Caucasian people and she may have been racist."}
{"text":"Everything is awesome here, and at reasonable prices, but my favorite is the fish and chips... battered halibut NEVER tasted so good!! Love the buzz too, for all ages and characters, families and singles, you name it! Awesome place. Parking sucks Fri-Sun though, come before 7pm!"}
{"text":"Amazing first experience. The staff was very friendly, the service was awesome and the food was amazing.  Definitely recommend, if you're in the Port Credit area."}
{"text":"So I came here for the first time for a cousins birthday. I was recommended this place for it's pasta and I'm glad I came. We had a customized penne pasta with spicy rose sauce combined with tomato sauce without any meat. The bruschetta was amazing, the mozzarella sticks and spinach dip was definitely my least favourite. The only reason why I gave this place 4 stars was because the server forgot to bring the birthday brownie and it was suppose to be a surprise. I had to ask for it again while paying the bill. His response was whether I still wanted it... Of course it's still my cousins birthday... This seemed very awkward for me but other than that the dessert was so satisfying.   Ps. This is kind of like a pub with very closely aligned seats and a loud atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, good food, good service, excellent location located in the heart of Port Credit. This time the owner/manager in clear violation of health codes allowed a friend of theirs to have their dog on the patio. When I complained I was told it was a guide dog in training. Ya right. The owner of the dog heard me complaining to the staff and said don't worry I know the owner he (meaning me) can go somewhere else if he didn't like it. The dog was way too old to be guide dog in training. The owner/manager did not even have the customer service attitude to come out and discuss the situation with me (probably because he knew what he was spewing was rubbish). Arrogant owners who think their guests don't have other choices get rude awakenings. I will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"A staple in the area. And for good reason! Food is great. Ambience is great. It has a bar in the front, but has seating for families in the back.   If you're looking for a place to have dinner with friends or a nice romantic meal this is great either way! Food is excellent. Wine selection is great.   They don't offer a lot for gluten free but, Papa Giuseppe's, which is partially owned by them, is next door, and it offers gluten free/vegan/vegetarian options.   Recommend both wholeheartedly!!!"}
{"text":"I live nearby so come to one of the three Pump locations pretty regularly.  The Pump House Grille is the location that I come to most on week-ends in the morning to grab the breakfast special, which is really cheap for the amount of food you are getting.  Two eggs, toast, home fries, fruit, and sausage for well under 10 bucks is good value.  If you have read my other Pump reviews, the food here us very good, way better than a lot if the pub chains that are out there. Even though they were not a part of my breakfast this morning, I give a shout out to the seafood quesadillas and the beer selection!  The staff are very friendly and attentive, and the decor (especially in the \"new \" addition) is \"upscale pub\".  All in all a great place to go with a buddy to grab a beer, a bigger group, or the fam!"}
{"text":"Thursday afternoon . I ordered a cup  pea soup it was very good  I have to give the soup 5 stars. Next it was the pump house burger with fries the fries we're perfect . But the burger was dry. Under seasoned . I will not order that again. Service was not that great had to wait for napkins , water refills where never done."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.   As soon as we walked in, the service was little to non existent. The greeting server sounded like she was dragged into work. I guess I wouldn't want to come into a work place where the lack of organization is so obvious. Just with my experience, we had a different person all 5 times (taking order, bringing food, asking if the food was okay, taking away plates &bringing bill)  for drinks we popp'd it up with 2 cokes - the drink was way too sweet. The syrup was poured in and unfortunately no other option of drinks were given.  for our main: Coconut chicken with rice and roasted peppers. - The 'vegetables' consisted of 2 tiny pieces of grilled zuchini and a few slices of roasted pepper's. The chicken 'breast' was a very thin slice entirely covered with a coconut batter. I normally like coconut but the sweet taste was very overpowering. They could've given me mush and I still wouldn't have known the difference. The chicken didn't stand a chance. It also came with a tiny bed of rice which I enjoyed. Coming from a background where rice is second nature to every meal, I can be quite picky especially if the rice contains no flavor. The white rice was cooked well with a mild flavor enough to provide the right content of oil without leaving any additional grease marks.  The side sauce (which is normally poured over the chicken and rice) that resembled pudding was accurately creamy and sweet. It had bits of red peppers in it which was a nice change to the consistency. I didn't mind  the sauce since I choose it in doses but it would've definitely been too much if drizzled on top of chicken. The portion of this dish is way too tiny for a hungry customer.   The seafood Diavola was a seafood pasta dish. It consisted of jumbo shrimps , linguine pasta with spicy rose sauce. I liked the spicy rose sauce but I am not a big fan of my pasta tasting like seafood. Add that with my little preference to the long linguine noodles and it makes a less than average pasta meal. On the flip side, the portion is quite filling. I really liked the jumbo shrimps. The ends were cut off, which was nice to be able to eat without using your hands.    I wish I could count the \"are the meals satisfactory\" trip to the 1 star but to sadness of this place, it wasn't a genuine \"is everything okay?\". It was more like \" are you done yet?\". I get that you have 3 customers in the restaurant but seriously? 4 times is way to much.  The crowd was more or less the locals. Although, I imagine with the location of this place the customer traffic must not be an issue. It's immediately to the right of the parking lot and across the lake shore port.    The bill was $45.70 excluding tip. It's hefty for lunch and less than average service. I probs will not be returning.   xoxo M."}
{"text":"Sat in for a drink, had the peach kiss cocktail. It was delicious. Would recommend. The food smelled great but already had dinner that night. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is really special to me. It's been my go to bar since I've been legal. I've had at least 75 nights here in the last few years. There's just something about this place that really does it for me.  I really hate when drinks aren't mixed very well, and just taste like alcohol, then soda after. I find my drinks are always mixed well here. I also really love the decor and atmosphere. It's dark, yet lively. I love the high seats they selected with an unusual leather texture, and the exposed brick walls.   The food is surprisingly good for a roadhouse/pub type place. I'd go as far as to call it a high end establishment (sort of). You pay a bit of a premium on the prices but it's not a big deal. The portions are generous and all of the food is good. Some dishes that I would recommend are their pulled pork, penne a la vodka, their wings are on the small side but taste great (go on wing night for these), I even had their chicken fingers once (don't ask) and they were pretty good too.  The service is usually pretty attentive, but when the place is hectically busy, they may slow down a bit. With this being said I've never really had to wait a remarkably long time for my food, it's always been fairly quick. Worth mentioning also is that the port credit location is superior to the Clarkson one. Clarkson is a bit of a crappy neighborhood and it just doesn't feel the same.  With everything in consideration, I love this place."}
{"text":"Decent spot for drinks and a quick bite. The food is not overly spectacular and the beer selection is limited to primarily large brewers with few if any craft taps. Service and location are both ok and the ambience inside is very suburban family pub."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of people for the \"in between\" of a wedding from the ceremony to the reception.   It was a little too cold outside so the patio wasn't open, but we were able to get a spot inside. The inside is deceivingly big compared to the outside. He decor and overall lighting is dim and pub like.   The food was a-ok! Typical bar food quality and style. There are a lot of beer options both bottled and draft. I am not a beer fan so I stuck with my classic fave, a caesar.   Parking is a little bit of a pain, you can either fight for a side street spot or go to the library or Arena where there is a plethora of available spots.   Overall this is a solid pub style restaurant with good service. Will come again."}
{"text":"I thought I was going to like this place the way they set it up is nice however, the food was not good at all. I had the teriyaki chicken and it was way too salty, they put too much soy sauce. My friend had the fish and chips and even that wasn't good, no flavor and the fish was dry, the batter was hard. The only food I liked was the dessert the brownie sundae was good. Really disappointed spent so much money on a meal that wasn't even worth it. Didn't even want to take the leftovers home that's how bad it was."}
{"text":"Fun and chill spot to hang out with friends on a Friday night or Saturday afternoon for lunch. I went a few months ago with a group of friends and the service was quick and the waiters/ waitresses were friendly."}
{"text":"I've been here twice from out of town and both times it was a nice place to eat. Standard pub food that id recommend if you're looking for somewhere to eat, but nothing spectacular.  Ordered the PEI muscles and edamame as appetizers and they were really good. As an entree I enjoyed the chicken tenders. Both meals didn't disappoint and were tasty.  The service was great both times and the patio has a nice ambiance. If you're looking for a standard place to stop by, I'd recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Through all my Port Credit travels (and for those who've followed my reviews over the past couple of years, you know there have been many PC travels) I've ventured into The Pump House Grille on several occasions. Surprisingly enough this was the first time I had ever actually eaten a meal here.  The PHG is a cool spot in terms of looks, a perfectly circular center bar servicing a small-ish restaurant and bar area. With a new expansion taking over a neighbouring area and a recently expanded and fenced off patio space, the coming summer at the Pump House promises to be a good one.  This is definitely a good local watering hole offering good beer and basic bar drinks (vodka, gin, rye, rum, etc + mix). They also have a weekly Martini special, so I'm hoping that this is an initial forray in to cocktails because if they started doing old school craft cocktails I might become a regular myself!  For my first PHGC meal I went for the Louisiana Salad - baby spinach, tossed in honey Dijon dressing with blackened tiger shrimp, chicken, bacon, tomatoes + red onion. A hefty portion of fresh salad and toppings and the dressing was light and deliciousBUT the chicken and shrimp were so over blackened that I couldn't finish it as it was far too salty.  I'd still return here because I think they have some other amazing items on the menu by the looks of it that I just haven't tried yet. I'll happily adjust this review ocne I have more to base it on, until then, this place stands as A-OK in my books. Until next time...  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent pub fare. The specials are always good. Service has been excellent too. Wort going, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Recently dropped by the Pump House Grille for a quick dinner with friends. We arrived at about 7PM on a Tuesday and were seated immediately. The restaurant has a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. The first room is more of a bar, whereas the second room is more secluded.  The food was delicious. I had the daily soup (chicken and broccoli) with garlic bread and it was just enough to fill me up. The chicken was super tender! My friends ordered the greek salad with chicken and the jalapeno cheddar burger, which they also enjoyed and would recommend.   Service was great. My friend ordered a salad with shrimp but the waitress gave us the heads up that apparently it only comes with 3 shrimps (for an additional $9) so we thought that was really nice of her! She also recommended some things on the menu and answered our questions about portion sizes and was just very nice overall.   TIP: Parking can be a little crazy at peak times - try parking in the old No Frills lot (behind the Second Cup down the street!) If that doesn't work, try the Port Credit library next to the Pump House Grille, and if all fails, the Port Credit GO station usually has space!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch football and great food. Service is very good and friendly."}
{"text":"Great spot in Port Credit. A couple of the girls at the front could be a little more welcoming and on top of things but not a big deal. Cheers!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here 3 time so far. It's a great spot to get out of Toronto and enjoy the waterfront afterwards. Friendly staff, though it can be quite busy and this noisy. Chicken curry was amazing. Gluten free dinner and dessert options available."}
{"text":"Came in for Mother's Day. Maddy was our server - 5 Star ! $5 Caesar special.... Nice and spicy Pasta stroganoff was very good, though a bit too saucy near the end. Chicken Alfredo was also very good. Had the salmon pasta special.  Not bad, though too salty for our taste.   Nice atmosphere.  Would go again."}
{"text":"Location is great.  Love the lakeshore area of Mississauga.  Before today we had never been to this restaurant.  We have driven by many times and always wanted to go.  I wish I could give this place more than 2 stars.   We started off waiting 10 minutes to be seated.  No one else was standing with us and they were not that busy. Servers walked right by, no one made eye contact.  The bartender also did not make eye contact despite the fact that she was working about 5 feet in front of us.  Finally seated, we got drinks immediately which was nice.   We ordered at that point and waited 30 minutes for food.   30 minutes to be served a sandwich and soup.  I won't comment on the food because honestly when service is this bad, there isn't much reason to go back.  Given some of the other reviews that comment on long wait times we assume this is the norm.  Really unfortunate."}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a Tuesday which is wing night. We got 10 wings to start. They are $.79 with a drink purchase so a pretty good deal. I liked the flavor, however, being from Buffalo it's very hard for me to judge wings without bias. We ordered them grilled, which is said to take longer but actually they came out pretty quick. To me, they were a bit small and also not crispy. They fell apart as you ate them.   I got the japaleno burger with a side of French onion soup. The soup was really delicious. But, I would have liked it to come out before the meal not with it. But, that's something I should have asked for.   Also ordered the southwest wrap with sweet potato fries. The fries are delicious and come with a side of jalapeno dipping sauce. Overall I was happy with the burger and wrap. Large portions and our waitress was attentive. Big menu too. Lots of options and specials.   I'd definitely come back. The atmosphere in the back room was a good ambiance if you're looking for a nice dinner or date spot. The front room has the bar which is also a great option if you want just a bite or drinks."}
{"text":"We had the fish tacos, fajita salad, and Canadian burger. Everything was excellent. Great place to eat."}
{"text":"Friendly staff all around. Lots of seating. Booths, stools, you name it. Patio is kinda small though unless you are big on that this wouldn't be the place for you.   Good for drinks on a game and fight night. All year round.   Parking is a breeze, there is plenty on the street and the library next door allows until I believe 3 or 4 a.m.   Recommended."}
{"text":"Originally we were supposed to go to Papa Giuseppe's next door for a Birthday meal promo but the wait was 45 minutes, which was about 40 minutes longer then I was willing to wait. Luckily the offer was also for the Pump House Grille right next door as well. We had no wait, thought the place was quite full. My first impression was not the best as the greeter and another server/seater that came up to us were actually quite rude. Perhaps that establishment should consider switching up who is at the door, because if it were not for the good waitress we ended up with it would have lowered these stars.  We got seated at a booth, the place is really quite large, lots of TVs in the bar area, a bit loud but it was a Friday night. I was happy to see a veggie burger on the menu, which I got with the jalapeno cheddar toppings. The patty was just a frozen standard veggie patty but it was a good one (similar to Jack Astors). The toppings were so good! Very (spice) hot and super tasty.  My boyfriend got the steak which they covered as a Birthday meal item, which is simply amazing. He didn't have any intention going in of getting that; while just joking we were told it was covered with the promo. He said his meal was really great too. It is awesome that they do this free Birthday entree because now I know that this restaurant is better then I had originally thought it would be (likely would not have come here otherwise) and I found a great veggie burger option."}
{"text":"I tried this spot for dinner the other night and was very impressed!  I had previously said food was average because up to this point I only really ordered the pup type food with drinks.   Atmosphere was great, casual, yet still very nice.  Service was very attentive as well.  I'll definitely return again.  I still really only had not much more than pub food...fish n chips...but the rest of my table had more \"restaurant like\" food and they enjoyed it.  Actually my two pieces of fish were awesome too, not too greasy or fat feeling, just right.  Takes Amex too"}
{"text":"Awful service and awful food!  The burgers and fries were 100% frozen and the burger was dry, way over-priced and the beer on tap was flat"}
{"text":"The pump is a staple of port credit, but what most people don't know, is that they serve breakfast!!   I have been before for dinner but this review is solely on their breakfast service.  Their breakfast menu is quiet large, all of it being VERY reasonably priced.  I ordered the french toast, which comes with beans, fruit and homefries all for $10.  The food was delicious! Easily fills you up for most of the day, especially if you go mid morning.  The service was prompt and swift and they even let me keep my ice capp (altho I had to pour it into a glass).  The restaurant is quite large with plenty of seating, easy access to washrooms and even a patio for the warmer weather.   I can't say enough good things about the pump's breakfast service...  5/5"}
{"text":"Me and the BF ate here a very long time ago. The food is gooda nd the place itself is nice, especially in the summer time, but the owner/manager is a B***H. I had called to make a complaint about the service and the person that picked up the phone was very rude to me and was rushing me to get off the phone. he told me to call back later. I called back the next day to talk to the \"manager\" (who i later found out was the owner) and she was very rude to me and actually hung up the phone on me. I have never gone this far before but after that I emailed the place. She then apologized to me in an email and did nothing to try to get me to come back. Now i had already said since that happened (and how unprofessional it was) i would never go back but as a business owner you always try to keep clientele. I wan't trying to get free stuff but thats what happens in good places when people fuck up and obviously she did not care. And with that said I have not returned and have no plan to in the future."}
{"text":"I was at this location on the weekend and have been here before a few times . I guess I just kept forgetting to review it . Anyways this weekend I tried there nachos and I was very pleasantly surprised on how good they were . They actually spread the ingredients all around and layered the nachos not just threw everything ontop ...that's always very nice . The server was nice and prompt . The place is casual yet nice , meaning you can forsure bring a date . And the patio is nice .I will be back forsure ."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend. I did not enjoy the drunk young folk they served making lots of noise. And they do not offer boneless wings. I really love boneless wings. Food was tasty. It is an okay place, but I am not in love with it."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times for both breakfast and dinner. Good, solid pub food with a few surprises on the menu. My wife had the smoked salmon pasta, offered as a special, and thoroughly enjoyed it. They've got a great list of beers, and their wings are the best I've had in the 'Port so far. The only complaint is that the place is a bit spendy for what you'd think of as a pub with better food. But it's my safe, go-to place on the Port Credit strip."}
{"text":"A decent lunch crowd on a street where the lunch crowds are sparse usually bodes well, but we must not be in agreement with the locals, as there wasn't really much to praise here.  First off, I now realize that McCain is a Canadian company, but serving their fries in a restaurant seems taboo.  Frozen french fries I can get at the store, no thanks.  There is really no excuse to use supermarket fries at a restaurant.  That's like buying pre-chopped garlic.  The pesto chicken sandwich was actually pretty decent and the sundried tomato and goat cheese was really a  good combination.  However, that was really the only positive.  There was some redemption in not being charged for the wings, but it should never come to that.  Prices in general were a bit high for what is being served.  2 stars for what seemed like some really average and overpriced pub food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. The people are generally friendly and the food is consistently appetizing and reasonably priced. I've been there three times and I'd go again in a heartbeat.   It's generally busy so snag a table when you can."}
{"text":"When I first moved to the area in 2011, I was new to an established neighbourhood, most places have their regulars and it takes a while to feel 'welcomed and wanted' anywhere.  But not here.  Doris is a bartender at this place and she is freaking AWESOME! She immediately made me feel welcomed, special and important.  I sat at the bar and her service to not just me but to the others was (and still is) impeccable.  I ate a meal that not only was very tasty but very satisfying.  It is because of Doris and that level of service that I returned, over and over again.  There are other wonderful servers and bartenders (Paul is awesome as well... Jerry is amazing at pairing your food & wines together and his level of customer service is outstanding!) and yes, like any other place, there are some who aren't always up to par but not many.  I miss this place trumendously since moving to Etobicoke but return as often as I can.  Food wise - I can say with great certainty (as I have had almost everything on that menu and have made SEVERAL recommendations to newbies) the food is excellent.  My favorites are: Seafood Diavalo Linguine (linguine, seafood in a rose sauce), Seafood Bowl (medley of seafood in a flavourful tomato broth over rice), Goat Cheese Salad (cashew crusted goat cheese galette - SOOO GOOD!!), Chicken Pesto Penne is also one of my favorites.  The portions are very generous, often times requiring me to take home the uneaten portions.  The best 'bang' for your buck are the Nachos.  Even 3 of us could NOT finish the plate!  Their wings are on the small side but are really delicious (get them grilled).  They cook seafood and fish perfectly.  Their steaks are cooked to perfections as well!  I never hesitate to try their several daily specials as they rarely go wrong.  But the BEST nights are Wednesday nights: Oysters! They have freshly shucked Malpeque oysters on the half shell... and the price is very reasonable ($2/ea).  So if you are a fan of raw oysters, you don't want to miss it!  Saturdays & Sundays they offer breakfast until I believe 1 pm.  They have the Traditional breakfast on at half price until 11am.  I absolutely LOVE their breakfasts.  The Florentine omelette with a side of peameal is my go to, or the smoked salmon and cream cheese (I sometimes get goat cheese instead) on a bagel is great (but expensive).  All breakfasts come with fresh fruit, small baked beans and 2 toast.  Here's the thing: yes, it can be a bit pricey, especially if you are going to drink alcohol.  I will admit that I find their wine selection very poor but you can find something to go with your meal.  They have a decent beer collection and of course the barstaff can whip you up your favorite drink as well.  It is not the best place to come if you are on a strict budget.  But if you are, they always have some specials on that are reasonable and as I said, their portions are very generous.  I love this place. It will continue to be one of my favorite hang-outs.  I love sitting at the round bar when I go alone... the people are interesting, the bar staff are great and you can always catch a game or two or three from the TVs around the place. You will not go wrong eating at the Pump House!"}
{"text":"It's not the food so much as it's the location. When you live in a place like Mississauga, there are only a few places you'd be considered cool. I kid. I just happen to love the Port Credit and Pump House is one of the best places for dinner after a late evening stroll. The grub is good as is the ambience. Here's more:  Ambience: Dark, dimly lit with nice cozy pub seating.   Crowd: Group of friends, mid 20s-early 30s, and surprisingly a lot of families.  Variety: Huge menu. I like my salads and my pastas. But you'll literally find all sorts of pub-fare on the menu and it'll probably taste better than Jack Astor's. Just saying.   Verdict? I'm going back soon, you should too!"}
{"text":"It's alright.   I went there with my date on a Monday night, it was packed. A little too crowded for my liking. The waitresses' long flow-y sweater near hit me in the face every time she walked by trying to maneuver through the dining room. It was very loud, a lot of little kids (the night I choose to go hung over of course) and it was quite warm. We were seated right next to the door to the kitchen and every single time someone went through that door it slammed behind them very loudly. It was incredibly irritating.   The food was great. I got the Margarita Salad {grilled chicken on a bed of baby spinach with almonds, feta, cranberries in a honey balsamic dressing} and my date got the honey garlic/lemon pepper chicken wings for WING NIGHT (.69c/wing). This restaurant is pretty expensive. Most salads/pastas are $15.99 and up.   The service was friendly and fast.   I don't like how when you walk in the front door your boom-right there standing in the middle of the bar. It's kind of uncomfortable when they are so busy and you are standing next to somebody's table waiting for a seat.   I probably won't go back. It's just not worth the money."}
{"text":"Late night date night at the pump house grill!! The service was great and the food came out in a timely manner. We got the chips and crap dip for our app and penne a la vodka and sriracha chicken fettuccine. It was so good!! And a good amount too since we had leftovers. Will we be back? Who knows it's not a type of food that I certainly craved for but it is a must try place for others."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING ALERT!  If the owner is reading this, note that the following review could have been avoided if your staff handled it with least some level of refinement.  I recently had lunch here with three of my friends.  Three of us ordered fish tacos ($15 each) while the other ordered a Greek salad and soup.  We were told that the fish was \"grilled\" as opposed to deep fried.  The tortillas (shells) were either Dempster's or Old El Paso brand. The fish looked pan fried and not grilled, there was tons of Old El Paso or Tostitos type salsa on them, canned beans, a bunch of tomatoes, a teensy bit of sauce, a shitload of mixed greens and green olives - yes green olives. Anyway, after all of us took a few bites, we were all in agreement that the fish had gone bad.  One of my friends described hers as smelling like sewage.  The waitress never came around so we couldn't complain.  Finally, when we saw the waitress, we called her over to explain the situation. She just looked at us with a blank face and said she would be back.  We waited about five minutes and then she just took all the plates away even though my one friend was still eating her salad.  She said that the manager wants to \"examine\" the food.  So she comes back about seven minutes later and asked if we wanted anything else.  I asked what the verdict was about the spoiled food.  She said that the manager will take 50% off.   OK so that just pissed all of us off.  You serve bad, rotten food that could potentially give us food poisoning and you're still going to charge us?!?  WTF!  I asked to speak to the manager who took her slow, lazyass time to come over.  She kept assuring us that the fish was fresh and never really apologized.  We challenged her by bringing a taco over and eating one of them in front of us but, of course, she didn't comply to the request.  We explained that we eat sushi all the time and we know what fresh fish tastes like - not one person is complaining but three!  We asked what species of fish and were told Catfish; in other words it was Basa.  She eventually agreed not to charge us but brought the bill around for the soft drinks ...   Fast forward to the next morning - all three of us had to make a few extra trips to the bathroom."}
{"text":"I have only been here for drinks but the service is always fast and friendly. I have also ran into some local celebrities here like Jeff O'Neill.   Please comment if you have eaten here."}
{"text":"Just came back from a meal at PHGC - my first time in Port Credit !  A pub with an extensive menu, I tried the Belgian waffles with strawberries. My friend could not say enough about how amazing they were. They were okay, nothing special.   My friends and I will be meeting here again in a few months so I will update my review, if necessary, once I try a lunch item."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere....and extremely busy.  The portions are massive and the food is quite tasty.  The service is good and they are able to accommodate people with celiac disease quite easily.  If you want a great night out as a group I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"After Gord and I left Snug Harbour, we walked along Lakeshore Road and decided to check out The Pump House.  It was packed so we sat at the bar (we usually sit at the bar anyway unless we're eating anyway). The bar is big and round and in the middle of the room.   It's a big place ... there's a room on the side that was full too.   The bartender took good care of us. There were TVs above the bar and we had fun watching some lumberjack competitions and cheering on the competitors.  There were always people coming and going so it seems like a popular spot. We didn't eat there but the food looked liked typical pub grub.  I was impressed with the bathrooms. The doors were very nice and the walls between the stalls were the same frosted glass. You could see through them but not really.  I'd stop back the next time I'm in Port Credit ... there was a good vibe."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to give this resto a try, despite the somewhat lack lustre reviews. Our experience started out well - our waitress immediately approached us once we were seated and took our drink order, our food didn't take too long and was well staggered between starters and entrees, but as soon as we were done eating, our plates were removed and our waitress never came back. We weren't even offered a dessert/coffee menu. She literally just vanished. We didn't mind initially because we were chatting, but eventually the time had expired on our parking and we needed to get going. We flagged down a passing waitress and she looked at us kind of blankly when we asked if she could find our waitress so we could pay. I guess someone else overheard because she just kind of walked away and another girl came with our bill. Then our waitress showed up to take the payment. It was a very odd ending to our meal and would probably prevent me from choosing to go back.   Now for the food. They do have a gluten free menu with several options. A few appetizers, salads, pastas and fish and steak. I had the pasta a la vodka which was made with a rose sauce and had pancetta. It was quite good, though very rich. The noodles had a good consistency and didn't fall apart as I was eating, which I appreciated. There was a ton of sauce and sausage left when I was done. If I ordered it again, I'd ask for a bit less sauce.  I had a starter garden salad which was just ok. It was standard and nothing to write home about.  My friend had the wild mushroom flatbread - it looked delicious and and she really enjoyed it. For her meal she had the pump club (a club sandwich) and she enjoyed that as well. They had nice big crispy fries on the side too.    So the meal was pretty good, but the service was spotty.  The location is nice with decent availability for street parking (though I imagine it might be harder on a Friday or Saturday night). The prices were on the higher end of bar and grill prices but still not bad."}
{"text":"I am always blown away by the quality of the service provided by The Pump House Grille's staff and their wide selection of delicious menu options! I've been going to The Pump House Grille Company for quite sometime now & I've never had an experience that was anything less than perfect.   The restaurant is conveniently located right by free parking and is in walking distance of the lake. The dining room atmosphere is perfect for Date Night! The lights are dim, there are gorgeous paintings and big screen TVs mounted on their red brick walls.   Last night my date and I ordered; The Firecracker Chicken & Spicy and Sweet Shrimps as appetizers. They were both delivered in a timely manner - which was great because we were starving! As our main course, we ordered; Pumphouse Burger and Blackened Salmon - which were both absolutely delicious! The salmon was cooked just right and was served with white rice and roasted bell peppers - I would highly recommend you try it!  Our server was on point - she checked on her tables regularly and always asked us if we wanted another round before our Creemore pints were empty. She was super friendly and her service definitely enhanced the outstanding dining experience."}
{"text":"Pump House sits at crossroads of the ghetto and nice parts of Port Credit. It's where crackheads and bums mingle amongst the well-to-do. It is a short stroll away from the marina and the lake. In patio season, the pub transforms into a lively hub for dwellers.   The demographic is in the 30-50 range. The pub is clean, well-lit and adorn with big screen tvs all around.   The menu is huge. They have everything from pastas and seafood to gluten-free items. Their prices are more than what they should be. To give you an idea, burgers start at $14 and a pint of beer is almost $8. The food is pretty mediocre. The staff are pleasant but the food is exceptionally slow to arrive."}
{"text":"Based on my own experience, I think this place only deserves 2 stars.  The food was salty as hell. We ordered calamari as a starter and it was so salty, but thank God it came with this really good sauce which made it okay. In addition to that, I also ordered poutine, which came drenched in gravy and it was super salty.. I should've complained about it but the service there was super slow and disappointing that I did not even bother.  It was hard to get the attention of the servers who came walking past us and completely ignored us although we were calling for them. And to be honest, it was not even that busy when we went.  Despite all of this, I do want to say that the actual restaurant itself was nice and it looked it looked kinda small from the outside but it had a lot of seating on the inside.   Maybe we were unlucky and just came at the wrong time, and the service and food is actually amazing at a different day, but I was seriously disappointed and I'm not interested in coming back."}
{"text":"Whoot whoot!  I am a fan!  I recently had to adjust my diet and I was worried when I came here with friends about what to eat.  The waitress was wonderful and adjusted my order without any fuss.  She made me feel special and welcome!  I had the omelette with spinach and goat cheese.  The side dishes were adapted for me to have a bit more fruit to replace what I couldn't eat.  All in all, it was a lovely meal in a nice atmosphere!  Happy day!  Many thanks to the Pump House Grille staff for making my visit with friends a positive one!"}
{"text":"Great Service. I'm not a huge brunch fan as eggs make me feel a bit off after and I dislike smoked meat (ex bacon). But the fries were superb! and my burrito came with salsa, yum! The cup of fruit was a nice touch."}
{"text":"This restaurant has become one of our favourite places to eat.  The food and service are great and we love the extra late business hours."}
{"text":"Looking at the photo of potato skins I took makes me want to drool!  This place was delicious!  Small busy and intimate restaurant!  Awesome service and friendly staff. I will be going back!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go in Port Credit! Food is great for a bar with reasonable prices and servers are always attentive."}
{"text":"I've been to place a number of times, and normally I have a super great experience! It's not five stars just because last time I went I got super bad food poisoning, and the service wasn't as great as it normally is, with the food being kind of disappointing as well. I'll definitely eventually come back, but for now I'm a little disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre and the price was far too high. Baby back ribs were the worst I've ever had with dry mashed potatoes. I asked for a sparkling water with pineapple and paid for two drinks when clearly I got a small sparkling water in the bottle poured into a glad with a squirt of pineapple. But she charged me 3.50 for the pineapple. I complained and she would'nt do anything. I was stunned to pay for a small glass or sparkling water with I little pineapple juice $7.00. Bad food bad service."}
{"text":"The Pump House Grille is always a great place to go for a bite to eat, the atmosphere is nice and the people working there are friendly. The food is really amazing I would recommend the nachos if you ever go!"}
{"text":"Went with a couple of friends just to have a drink Saturday night. Very cool place! Great vibe, has several ambience with lots of seating. Even though we got a table pretty far from everything (the place was packed!) the service was very good.   We didn't have anything to eat because we just had dinner at a sushi restaurant so we didn't really look at the menu, but the drinks were yummy! Their Caesar is bold and spicy and they offer a pretty nice set of vodka drinks. Also a lot of variety in beers on tap.   Great place for drinks. I might try the wings some other time, they looked amazing!"}
{"text":"We waited tonight for a table for two. They told us 20 min. By 40 min still no table. Went into ask and was told another 10 min. After waiting another few minutes we overheard the hostess told another couple that the kitchen is backed up and food will take at least 30 min once seated. I went back to ask the hostess if that were true and she said yes without even an apology. 45 min wasted. Extremely dishonest. If they were honest intially we would have returned another night. But with this interaction...we would never go here again."}
{"text":"went awhile ago for a saturday breakfast  great atmosphere, great staff. food is cooked to perfection  love it  will always come back"}
