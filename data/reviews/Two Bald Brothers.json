{"text":"Ordered the Hummus with mushrooms. i was excited when I heard Hebrew, expecting an authentic meal.  It bordered on inedible. The hummus was cold and grainy. The mushrooms were part warm and part cold. They appeared to be canned, and were swimming in a gelatinous, off-putting brown sauce.  On the expensive side, and I expected soooo much more. Will not return."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients set this place apart to me. Try the red cabbage it's really good. I have had the falafel salad here and loved their dressing. The pita bread they should sell in bulk."}
{"text":"Let me guess,  it's Israeli food right? LOL,  a cheap knock off of what real middle eastern food is. Stick to latkas and matza ball soup"}
{"text":"\"Mediterranean food\" is so vague, which is why I usually go in with no expectations. Today, that actually served me well.   We ordered the hummus with chicken shawarma on top, chicken shawarma sandwich, and a cheese pizza. The hummus truly tasted as though it came straight out of a can with its curdled texture and absolute desperation for flavor. The chicken shawarma was dry and borderline burnt. The beauty about shawarma is how well it retains its moisture while still providing a slight crunch on the outside...IF done correctly. The chicken shawarma sandwich was about the same..we had asked for some sort of garlic sauce, which the cashier said they don't have. The pizza looked and tasted like a frozen pizza thrown in the oven..but I won't hold that against them because I shouldn't have ordered a pizza from a supposed Mediterranean joint.   The place was also completely empty on a Saturday afternoon. Like, not a single person walked in during the 30 or so minutes we were there...I quickly learned why. Needless to say, I won't be back."}
{"text":"This was a super delicious spot that I have been meaning to try for a couple months now. I got the shakshuka which was amazing. The sauce was super flavorful and tasted great on the bread we had as well as with the eggs. The hummus was very smooth and had a good dose of tahini. I also tried one of the falafel and it was perfect. I feel like a lot of falafel is too dry but these were crunchy on the outside but still moist inside. The service was super friendly; they answered all of our questions (from a group including vegetarians and food allergies-so several questions) and didn't try to rush us out even though they were getting ready to close while we finished up. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a great quick and easy place to grab a falafel. Reasonable prices. Ample street parking. Friendly staff. Come here if you're unsure of where to go! The falafel salad and sandwich are great as well as the French fries and hummus."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the area eating at another restaurant when we decided to try this restaurant the following day. We had high hopes based on Yelp reviews.  We entered with the idea of eating in the restaurant. That was quickly changed after we smelled a strong sewer smell that sometimes occurs at different locations in Vegas. We did not walk out but decided to order our food to go.  We both had the chicken plate which unfortunately had no flavor. The rice was bland and the French  fries lacked seasoning. The pita bread was hard and hummus very thick and tasteless.  We gave it a fair shot, but will not be back. The two stars are for the workers anxious to please customers."}
{"text":"I'm always happy to have a new Mediterranean dining option, and when I heard Two Bald Bros moved into the downtown area, I headed over pretty quick. Menu has pita sandwiches, plates, and a few specialty dishes like their shakshuka. Unfortunately, a recent change in hours means that you can only get your fix on weekdays before 6PM. Kind of a bummer, hopefully not a harbinger of closure.  FIRST VISIT: Came in to signage hyping their falafel, opted for the wrap. This was rolled up taco style and served with a tasteless tahini. If they included hummus, I couldn't tell because there either wasn't much of it or that too lacked seasoning of any sort. The portion size was large but I prefer the more classic smaller, stuffed pita sandwich as this one didn't hold up well and resulted in a mess. Falafel was pretty good though, nicely crisp on the outside with a soft interior. Adding options for a spicy sauce, red cabbage, and pickled veggies would make this really pop.  I saved this as a draft and planned to return for their shakshuka for my second visit before posting a review. unfortunately, the business closed before I could make the weekday only hours fit my schedule. You really can't limit your business that much and survive in DTLV."}
{"text":"The location is perfect as it's right next to all the fun stuff downtown but not right in the center of all the craziness.  The staff was helpful suggesting their personal favorites and the actual service was great.  If you have never tried this type of food this is a good place to start! I literally inhaled the Shakshuka, it was absolutely delicious. ( definitely my favorite) I really enjoyed the bread they give you with it too, part bagel/ part grain bread. The tabouli is obviously freshly made and wonderful. My husband devoured the baby chicken, potatoes and rice with no complaints. We also tried the falafel, which was quite yummy- along with the hummus and tahini. I was happily full when I left :-) The bowls and plates they serve the food on has a perfectly fitted cover, in case you don't finish- really convenient. We have returned weekly since first going. I highly recommend Two Bald Brothers!"}
{"text":"Great place. Everything fresh. Hummus delicious. Clean. Perfect. Had the shawarma plate with baked potato and salad. They added grilled onions with the meat. Just great!!!"}
{"text":"This is fairly new to the Downtown area but they have Hummus plates so I am giving it a try! OH MY GOODNESS! Fantastic Hummus with Shawarma. Big serving and fresh !! OH MY!   I work around the corner at Container Park so this will be a regular lunch place for me. The bread is fresh as xan be and the baklava is yummy! They deliver so makes it even easier!! Can't say enough good things about here. Try it out. They are open till 8 pm so I'm sure dinner is just as great as lunch."}
{"text":"Friendly staff that took the time to offer suggestions and great options for the menu. The food was prepared well and tasted delicious."}
{"text":"I LOVE Mediterranean food so when I saw this place I was super excited!! Let me tell you...it was disappointing. Their menu was complicated and so you weren't exactly sure what you were ordering due to the naming convention they were using. And then, they gave you pickled vegetables as your side. Fries are extra. These veggies were so doused in vinegar, they were inedible. I ordered the crispy chicken wrap which was not bad. But the wrap itself was \"floury\" and messy to eat. Cous Cous, although not great restaurant, is better. You can at least get a gyro there."}
{"text":"We wanted to try something new downtown. Read some reviews, all really good. So we tried it  ourselves, the food is very fresh, very delicious and the staff was super friendly. I highly recommend giving it a try they make you feel like family."}
{"text":"WOW,  such good food.  So authentic and fresh.   We walked in thinking we might get some good food but where blown away by what appeared in front of us on a plate.   The salad, you could tell had just been all cut up with the freshest cucumbers, tomatoes, green peppers, tasty feta, onions, and olives.   It was large enough that you didn't feel it was over priced.   Chicken dish  was also tasted.  The people working there treated you better then your family would.  I wish I lived in the area,  this would be my go to favorite spot to eat.  Did miss the pita and bagel, so soft and just made fresh everyday.  I wish there was a higher rating, I can't think of anything that would bring down there five star rating."}
{"text":"This might be my favorite new Mediterranean Spot in town. Some of the best hummus and freshly baked pita I've ever had. I wish they had kept the tacos on the menu."}
{"text":"Looking for great food and I was told about this place. I'll be back! I ordered the chicken shawarma with salad and beans. Very good."}
{"text":"Very good little place!  Clean trendy and the menu had enough variety tofind something but small enough to do it right!  I had a greek pizza that was really good!"}
{"text":"Had the hummus and falafel plate. Falafel was tasty as was the hummus. Light and good. Definitely would recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Two Bald Brothers nailed it, another great food location for the downtown connoisseurs!!! The falafel wrap is SUPERB!!!  Congratulations!!!"}
{"text":"This is fast becoming one of my favorite hummus stops.  I really like their pita with the sesame seeds.  Every time we stop in for lunch it's quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Was excited to try since it's close to where I work. Got the chicken schwarma. It was very average. The sides were instant potatoes and instant rice. I had to ask for taziki and they grudgingly filled up half a little cup. Portions were OK sized but it was ultimately $12 for bland chicken and rice. I might be willing to try getting another dish but Sultan's Grill is right up the street and much better."}
{"text":"Fav new lunch spot downtown! Delicious schwarma/chicken/falafel and reasonable price point. $4 for a tub of hummus is cheaper than the grocery store and much fresher. Check it out."}
{"text":"very impressed with this restraint! delicious food that came out quite fast, which was perfect because I was on a thirty minute lunch break. The Chicken shawarma is delicious especially accompanied by the salad.I will be returning"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this little gem. The Two Bald Brothers knocked it out of the park. Ask for a side of their green sauce! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The food is terrible. I ended up throwing it away. I got the beef kabob plate with rice and mashed potatoes.  It seems like they used the lowest quality of beef possible. The rice and potatoes were completely flavorless. What a waste of $13! I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Amazing food !!! And super nice and loving service!! I order beef kabob plate that served with rice and vegetable salad and it was delicious!!! I was in Vegas for 3 days and I found this place in the first day.... and I returned on the second and third day as well for lunch. They have plenty of dishes to offer and each dish that I order was really good... this is what happens  when it's homemade cook!! No doubt BEST Middle eastern food in Vegas!! Will defiantly visit again in my next business project or vacation! Thank You  Gili"}
{"text":"Love this place great vibe inside of a low key spot killin it. Much love guys ill be back soon"}
{"text":"The husband and I found this place because we ran into their delivery guy and he was so nice! He gave us a menu and encouraged us to go check it out. A few weeks later, we finally made it over there. I'm so glad we did! The staff was great and so was the food! The falafel was my favorite, it was crisp outside and had the perfect balance of seasonings. I will return just for that!"}
{"text":"Amazing food !! And great service ! The pizza and beef kabob wrap were outstanding ! Will defiantly visit again !!"}
