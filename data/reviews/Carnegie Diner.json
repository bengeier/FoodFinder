{"text":"Amazing place with great food and friendly service! The restaurant owner has recently changed. The owner made the food fresh as soon as we ordered. Affordable food and great quantity. Every item I have tried has been amazing. If in the area, check it out! I definitely recommend this!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were staying at a hotel in Carnegie and they had a menu for the Carnegie Diner so we thought we'd check it out.  When we got there it didn't look like it was open - kinda dark and empty looking but the door was unlocked so we went in and sat in a booth.  After a few minutes the girl behind the counter said \"I'll be with you in a few minutes.\"  We were the only customers there and she didn't seem to be busy doing anything else.  For the next 5 minutes I watched her hang out behind the counter and yawn, and occasionally stroll to the other end of the counter as if she was bored.  After about 5 minutes she took our order.  It was a simple order:  one hamburger and one cheeseburger.  I asked \"what comes on it?\" and she replied \"nothing.\"  So I asked for onion, pickle, tomato, lettuce, and mayo.  I think she spelled out every word because it took her forever to write it down and she had to squat down and use our table as a writing surface.  My friend noticed track marks on her arms so we figured she was on heroin.    We then heard one of her coworkers telling someone in the kitchen \"she can't be doing that before work\" and \"I can't have her falling asleep here.\"  When she brought our food to us, she said \"I don't know who gets what\" and plopped our plates down and walked away. The burgers were OK (not good) although they did get the toppings all wrong.  The fries were awful - totally soaked in grease and soggy.  The other girl (Manager?) apologized to us and asked the cook to drive the waitress home so she could \"get some rest\" I guess.  When the cook walked out his entire ass was sticking out of his pants.  Yes, he had on underpants, and I'm not anti-sagging... it just made with think \"what next?\"  We met some people later that day who were also from out of town and we warned them not to go there, but it was too late.  They had already been there the day before and told us about their nightmare of waiting so long that they almost left (and they said the place was empty). I can't even imagine what they would do if they had 5 or 6 tables to serve."}
{"text":"I was on the search for a new breakfast place to try. I have a regular place down the street which is excellent. I walked into a an empty place and when I left it was still empty. The place had a heavy old grease smell. My coffee was not hot. The sausage patties were tasty, but much too salty. Eggs were ok. The \"Italian\" toast was some cheap white bread  They only offer turkey bacon. The interior is very bland, uncomfortable booth. The cheap lights were very glaring. The waitress was nice and helpful. The cook could barely speak English . I really wanted to like the place , but it just didn't make it. It needs better food and a better interior feel."}
{"text":"Eh, in place of Debbie Gate's All-not so good grill.  New owner has painted the place, cleaned it up some, it is better but not a great interior due to how it was designed and age.  Some of the lights hanging as if on a construction sight.  Lights behind the counter are just to glaring when hanging out.  Really need to fix or cover.   The staff/waitress's are the same as the prior restaurant.  Nice and friendly and do an OK job.  Menu has many types of burgers, sandwiches, salad, chicken waffles and breakfast items.  Every Thursday the menu includes Ribs.  Ribs were pretty standard ribs that are about as good as any in the area, had a little sauce that was sweet with a little spicy flavor.  Had a side salad of linguine with cheese, pepperoni, olives and a dressing.  Salad was OK, a little to cold at first."}
