{"text":"Stopped on a whim driving by. 1:00for lunch. One couple was leaving when we arrived and no one else was in the place. Another couple arrived 10 minutes later. So only two couple and it took 10 mins to get a menu. 

Server didn't know what beer was on draft.   We ordered a beer and a coke. Took another 5 mins to get both and the beer was flat. They offered a bottle of the same beer then came back and said there was none cold. Finally got that settled and looked at the menu. 

Decided in a Reuben, pulled pork and hand made chips. Took 10 more minutes then was told they were out of pork and chips. So parm/garlic wings it was. 

We were in there 45 mins before the food came up in the window and the waitress took it to the other couple who of course said it was the wrong food. Waitress took it back to the cook who told her it was for us. There were only the two tables!! She got it to us. 

The Reuben was good but the fries were way over salted. The wings had shredded parm cheese and garlic chunks on top but were impossible to eat like that. When you picked them up everything fell off but the wings were cooked nicely and were a good plump size. Not those small shriveled kind. 

If they are newly opened maybe they just have to work out the kinks."}
{"text":"Excellent local watering hole. Always great service and great good. Get the gamecock sandwich. It has everything you could ask for: barbecue chicken, bacon, jalape√±os, honey mustard."}
{"text":"Not typically my kind of place...but it is the only game in town at the moment.  Have gone for drinks with friends a few times.  They need to get their act together.  Never know what beer is on tap.  Our friend orders a beefeater's with a twist - not too difficult, right?  At Brews it is a decided challenge.  We have ordered burgers once and apps a couple of times.   It takes soooo long to get food - and the place isn't even busy.  Our friend wanted mushrooms with her burger.  They brought the burger out and said the mushrooms were cooking.  About ten to fifteen minutes later, they came out and said can't find the mushrooms.  Huh??  Got nachos.  Never order them!  Horrible.  The portion size is insanely huge...but it is virtually inedible.  This place could be a goldmine if it was run right and their food decent.  However, they fall terribly short on both categories."}
{"text":"Had a lucky glass of makers mark and some delicious fried pickle chips during the first half of the panthers game tonight.  I definitely plan on returning when work takes me down south again.  It's a nice setup for a small locally owned place.  I always enjoy seeing employees hang around, they give good advice.  The place opens at 11 for lunch but last time I stopped by on a weekday night i must have been late."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for an early dinner on tues.  we didn't know what to expect.  Once our eyes adjusted to the darkness we found a very pleasant atmosphere in what looked like a newly renovated sports bar.
We were seated immediately and our drink orders taken.  I ordered the quesadillas which were very good except they do not serve quacamole with it.  My husband ordered the liver (hard to find at most restaurants), and said it was excellent.  It was covered in gravy and huge fresh mushrooms.  Our waitress was very attentive.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"They've done a great job with the  remodel and one of the best hamburgers and wings around. 
Service can be slow so don't be in a hurry and enjoy"}
{"text":"Hubby and I went this afternoon . . primarily because it's close to home, and we wanted to see how they had revamped this restaurant since its previous incarnation, The Pour House.  We had heard they serve fried mac & cheese, which really piqued our interest!  However, we were VERY disappointed to sample it.  It was creamy mac & cheese coated in thick breading and deep fried.  I had hoped for a more substantial, homemade mac & cheese that, once cooked & cooled, can be sliced and pan fried alone, not with heavy breading.   This option is a LOT cleaner, and probably cheaper to produce/serve.
We also ordered Lobster Potato Skins and a Reuben.  Lobster Potato Skins . . are you kidding?  Who could resist this?  And, they were really, really great bar fare with beer.  The Reuben was a fantastic grilled sandwich made with bread that is baked at a local bread bakery (Breadsmith), great pastrami, sauerkraut, and melted cheese.
Our waitress, Casey, was friendly, attentive and offered much valuable information about the menu and chef.
Overall, the visit exceeded our expectations, and we will return.  But, please guys, work on the fried mac & cheese!  This could be your signature appetizer!  As it is, it tastes like it came out of a box . . . out of the freezer."}
{"text":"Convenient, easy, tasteful bar food. It's not a 5 star restaurant. If that's what you want, this isn't your spot. The wait staff is always very nice. A little slow, but always nice!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! The first time we went in we got a warm welcome....and every single time since. Austin waited on us and gave us some awesome recommendations and he was absolutely right on. All the servers and bartenders are super nice and on the ball. Service is phenomenal!  Most of the food is really really good! The lobster bisque is to die for. Salads are fresh and crisp and generously portioned. We love spicy and when they say spicy they mean it! Nice selection of bar food and healthier choices. Great daily specials,  live music on the weekends, comfortable, cozy atmosphere with a little patio area outside where you can take your drink and have a smoke or eat outside in nice weather. Great beer selection and new beers to try on a regular basis, plus drink specials.  This really is your hometown bar. I just can't say enough good things about it. Once in a while the food might be a little off...but they're always more than happy to fix it for you. There's only one thing I don't like, and that's that I can't get my burger med- rare. They'll only cook to medium-well but even as picky as I am about that usually, because I love this place so much I can overlook it. (But Brews owners...it would be really nice to have burgers cooked to order :-) Regardless, this is our absolutely favorite place in town! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love this place! We have been three times and the food is always great. Highly recommend the garlic wings - nice and crispy, as well as the philly cheesesteak - bun is grilled. Love to support a local place instead of a big chain and I kind of like the simpleness of the place. Very casual, only been for lunch and at that time of day I would feel comfortable taking my kids there."}
{"text":"Brew's has really come on, growing from a bar with bar menu to an expanded menu with salads and appetizers, along with fish and burgers to a greater expanded restaurant-like menu today.  Wife and I were blown away as all the categories for food have been expanded and crafted.

You now can have a full meal with the quality excellent.  Service remains super with attentive wait people and a responsive kitchen and bar in support.  Prices are certainly reasonable and substitutions are OK.

Their shrimp and grits are cheesy and yummy.  I like their fried catfish, their fries are nicely done without being greasy or overly salty.  Quesadillas are a great drink accompaniment, salads are good sized and they make most all of their dressings in-house.  

It has truly become a restaurant with a large bar.

Although we are seniors you cannot escape the popularity of Brew's and their near nightly entertainment.  A variety of different bands are set up each week and you can see by the number of cars strewn in the parking lot that they are popular.  

Pretty soon you will maybe need a reservation.  Very convenient to Sun City being just outside of the main entrance.  We have not had a bad experience there."}
{"text":"Walked in no one spoke to me.  Waited for a few minutes wanted to watch the tarheel. Still stood there.  Finally I walked out. Not a friendly place. Won't go back"}
{"text":"The new owner had put a lot of money into this place and it really has 
improved.  We went in there this summer and wouldn't go back but a friend recommended we try it now that they have remodeled and so glad we did.  They have great wings, hand pattied burgers, great onion rings and fries and more.  I have talked to the owner who wants to know if you have an issue because he will fix it.  I highly recommend going in here.  It has become our go to spot."}
{"text":"Very good burger beer and service
Surprised not a little more crowded at 
12:30 on  a Monday
Will go back looked clean and neat"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Brews Tavern based in the recommendation if our Del Webb sales contact. He said the restaurant was under new management and they had invested in a new kitchen and facilities. The decor is basic sports bar. Could use slightly larger TVs but they are adequate. We went on a Wednesday at 8 pm and had no problem getting a table. We ordered the philly cheese steak sandwich and buffalo chicken wrap. Both items were very good. In fact the philly steak was excellent. Our server was very nice and the food was delivered timely and hot. We definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food is good...great selection of bar bites! The staff and people who go here are all friendly. Owner, Howie, used to bartend at PJ O'Reilleys."}
{"text":"Super awesome service.. Had the burger and fries. The burger was great and the fries were the best in town.. Great place have a beer after work.."}
{"text":"Went to check this place out on a recommendation from a family member. Place was full around 7 on Friday night, but that didn't stop the bar staff from taking my drink order within the first minute at the bar. Found a table and sat down to enjoy my drink with some friends. Waiter brought  us a menu and made a few recommendations, the cheeseburger wrap and the buffalo chicken wrap, we went with those and some pretzel bites. Everything came out quickly and was still hot. Great flavor in everything. Waiter kept our glasses full even when I switched to water. There were representatives from all ages and socioeconomic backgrounds. Loved it and will go back next time I am near."}
{"text":"The first time we came the food was FANTASTIC, crispy and delicious wings, and fantastic cheese fries. The live music was great and service was good. 

The second time we came it was the exact opposite. The kitchen closes at 10pm but we were told they could do boneless wings and the flatbread. Both were almost inedible. The chicken was actually black it was so over-cooked, and the flatbread made Ellios frozen pizza squares seem like a gourmet meal...a $9 MESS. This time around the band was really really bad...but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that this was their first gig there? Hopefully they won't be back. 

I'm not sure I'll return for bar bites...maybe just a drink or two."}
{"text":"I loved their breaded chicken tenders with sweet chili flavor, then something changed. It is no longer available, chicken tenders are just like all the other restaurants have on their menus. No breading and sweet chili sauce only available as a side, plus much smaller in size. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink after watching a play at Sun City. This review is only for drinks; the service was very good. We sat at a high top table and was greeted by Lindsay who informed of drink specials and food. We ordered drinks they arrived quickly. The pricing is very good here as we had 4 drinks (3 glasses of wine 1 beer) and came to $20.  The parking lot is large and the place was very clean. Stop by and get a drink if your in the area."}
{"text":"I really like coming here. The wings are hands down the best in town. The nachos are fabulous. Their salad dressing, especially the blue cheese is wonderful. We usually order sandwiches. My favorite is the Gamecock sandwich, without the Jalape√±o. LOVE IT! The staff is great and there's always a table available no matter how packed the parking lot is."}
{"text":"This is an interesting place. From the outside it looks like something out of the movie Roadhouse. A place where the cops have to come by a twice a week make a couple arrests after bar fight that involves at least one person getting clocked by a broken bottle of Bud.  But I digress.  

We pulled up and parked in the gravel parking lot and made our way in past pickup trucks, mini vans, BMW's and Infinities. Inside looked like someone's basement bar /man-cave.  Five TV's turned baseball, hockey and basketball.  Normal looking crowd, Tom Petty on the jukebox and Copper on tap.  Where am I? This is weird.  

Hubs had the fish n chips. I had a quesadilla - both not bad.  Pretty decent as a matter of fact.  Great, attentive service.  

Now let me enjoy my Copper while I wait for the cops to get here."}
