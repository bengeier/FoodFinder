{"text":"Who can say enough great things about Aladdin's? I did want to point out that they made a hummus lover out of me. I never wanted to try hummus because it reminded me of baby food but I grew up and tried a dish (theirs is the best hummus on earth) that was here probably before Christ arrived. I am a hummus junkie, especially Aladdin's hummus. Thanks Aladdin's. :)"}
{"text":"With such low prices and excellent quality, I don't know how this business makes enough profit to stick around. Whatever they're doing, it's working: Aladdin's has been a Cleveland landmark since the 1970s. Mostly a wholesale operation, they make Middle Eastern specialties to sell to many local grocery stores and restaurants. The company is open to the public for a quick, cheap bite to eat.  Expect pita, hummus, tabbouleh, grape leaves, canned drinks, and baklava.... I have some pictures of the food up on my blog (http://whatsincleveland.blogspot.com/2011/05/alladins-baking-company.html) if you want to go check it out. My friend and I ate well for under ten bucks."}
{"text":"This is not the Aladdin's chain that you see everywhere. I am giving it 5 stars for 2 reasons. Their hummus and nan. Wow. I love hummus and have had it many places as well as making my own. Their regular and garlic hummus' are by far the best I've ever had. Their \"nan\", a type of pita, is the best as well. I recommend putting the nan in the microwave for about 20 seconds before eating it. The best part is the price. It is so cheap! Definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I used to grocery shop here. Everything is fresh and delicious and healthy. Everything is so cheap. You can get pita, a bunch of tubs of spreads, grape leaves, middle eastern pizzas, desserts, etc. and your total will probably be around $20 for everything. It's also the perfect place to stock a picnic basket since you don't even need utensils for most of your meal."}
{"text":"Alladdin's Bakery used to be a lunchtime favorite of mine. The older gentleman was always gracious and helpful. Today we ordered lunch to go (Saturday Jan. 26, 2013) the order consisted of a small order of battered and fried eggplant. The eggplant was sliced very thin and soggy after the 3 mile ride home. A waxed envelope would have been better packaging than the styrofoam box. We also ordered 3 gyro sandwiches with the sauce on the side. There was no sauce in the bag. I don't know why they toast the pita for a gyro sandwich and I also wonder when they changed to a lower grade of fatty gyro meat. The order also included 3 squares of  baklava cut diagonally but lacking the gooey syrup, no need for finger licking. All in all the lunch was pretty disappointing luckily I had pita chips at home and made my own fattoush salad. We also purchased a bag of fresh pitas, a jar of the pickled turnips and a box of gummy worms for the kid. Out the door $35.00, we should have gone to Nate's on W. 25th where Jackie would have taken good care of us."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  The food is fresh and quick and even better the prices are great.   It is directly across the street from the Hilton Garden Inn go here for breakfast rather than the hotel!"}
{"text":"Had a great falafel sandwich.  Very good and fast too!  Was looking for something vegan and this fit the bill!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Staff were extremely helpful and patient with my many questions. Quite a few vegan options. We were visiting from out of town and even got a selection for the road. Don't miss the green bean salad and cashew baklava-to die for!! We will be back when we are in town again!"}
{"text":"The best meat pies. A large variety amazing food. Nice people. Pretty Authentic Ethnic food. Once again Meat pies are to die for, great hummus and feta just a great place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"i love middle eastern foods foods.  i live near euclid in cleveland and make the trip down to carnegie every once in a while. hummus / tehini , varies pitas, their wild pickles, & olives, tabooli, baba, and most recently their spinach pies stuffed ....stuffed perfectly are great.  for a sit-down i go to nates.  really recommend aladdin's if your looking for something different ....out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"So, you know that restaurant you thought was good until someone told you they saw a mouse behind the counter? Or that time you found a hair in your sandwich? A fly in your soup? When was the last time you saw the woman making your sandwich flossing inbetween orders... behind the counter... in plain sight of everyone in the store/restaurant? Gross."}
{"text":"Aladdin's on Carnagie is the perfect one-two punch,  Hungry?  Have to get a few groceries for home?  Get a sandwich or a pie, devour it on the steps of that church next door, then you don't have to do shop when you're hungry.  Inexpensive pita bags, some of the best kalamata olives, above par hummus and baba ganouj.    My mother and I would come here after my radio show on Fridays while she was on lunch from work.  The old guy behind the counter, Jimmy, would always remember our names and give a hearty \"HOWJADOO THIS WEEK GLOR?\"  They used to have really good rice pudding too but I think they stopped doing that.  Oh well, you can get some from Kan Zaman's as long as it hasn't been sitting there since the Seinfeld season finale."}
{"text":"First visit to the store and my experience was beyond my expectations. I went in to purchase grape leaves, Tahini, olives and pita and walked out with much more. The meat pies were wonderful, but the service was better! The gentleman behind the counter was very helpful and accommodating. He talked to me about where I was from and why I was in Cleveland etc., a rare occurrence  anymore! This will not be my last visit!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian friendly!!!  They have many choices for vegetarians and meat eaters. The food is amazing. Perfect for carryout.  They also have limited space inside to eat there.   Their menu has many amazing things to try, but you will be very happy just picking up their hummus and fresh baked pita.  Once you try their hummus you will realize all the hummus in the grocery stores tastes bland in comparison. Their pita pizzas and baklava are really good."}
{"text":"Why I haven't gone straight to Aladdin's Baking to buy Naan is beyond me (I've left myself to the mercy of *hopefully* finding it on the shelves at Constantino's only to find it's always sold out).  This is a carryout version of Aladdin's restaurant with a variety of wraps, sandwiches, soups, tabbouleh, hummus, pastries, etc.  They have lots of different kinds of pita bread and of course, their delicious Naan.  It is MUCH fresher if you buy it there and it costs less ($3.00 for 2 packages of Naan which usually cost $5.00 at Constantino's).  And there is a little Mediterranean/ Middle Eastern market in the back.  Metered parking out front."}
{"text":"It's true, you can't possibly beat the price to amazingness ratio the Aladdin's distribution center.  Half fast-food restaurant and half grocery store, when I go I get lunch and stock up on hummus, baba and pita for a week or two - and then play the \"guess how much I paid!\" game with coworkers.    If you find yourself wanting everything like I usually do, let me tell you now:  the $3 \"small\" fettoush salad, falafel sandwich and $2 mini pizzas are good enough to hold my interest week after week."}
{"text":"I have been to aladdins many times- I love that it is a family owned local restaurant that uses fresh ingredients. Everything I have tried has been good there but today I tried the chicken fattoush salad and it was amazing- very large portion with generous amount of fresh chicken (same chicken that's used in their shawarma). It was lean & seasoned well. The salad came with their house dressing that had a nice flavor yet wasn't spicy. Fast, friendly service! Great place to stop by and pick up food!"}
{"text":"Hate to really complain, has always been good, but was there yesterday and bought a bag of pita bread. As I got to the counter and ordered a sandwich I notice bite holes in the bag of the pita bread.   Showed it to cashier and he took it and set aside SAYING NOTHING.  Is this happening more than we think. He acted like nothing was wrong. People nice are running all over if this is the case. Something should be done"}
{"text":"This could seriously be the best hidden gem of Cleveland! Located across the street from the Hilton Garden Inn I regret not going in sooner. There is a lot to see and taste, don't go hungry, but if you are there are tables and chairs to make yourself comfortable while soothing your hunger while diving into your yummy food.  We had time to kill on our last day which was well spent buy 1 or 2 things at a time and hanging out peoples watching, very interesting mix of customers.  The pita bread was so tender melting in your mouth.  Thanks for delicious memories Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick lunch. I love their falafel sandwich (the falafel is flavorful and not too bread-y) and my bf loves the chicken kebab. The flavors are very clean and the veggies crisp.  We also got the hummus with tahini (so smooth and buttery. Can't wait to try the other flavors. I am eyeing the spicy one next) to dip our spinach pie in.  Can't wait to come back and get the above (plus stock up on their home mad pita and hummus)"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years, even before I moved to Cleveland. Now that I'm officially a downtown resident, I love that Aladdin's is just a few blocks away. First of all, they have a great little grocery offering a good selection of products. Hummus, olives, pita, olive oil, and a lot of sweets. A great stop if you want to stock up on well made, authentic food.  They also offer a pretty large menu of pita sandwiches, salads and other Mediterranean fare. I've tried many of their salads and their savory pies- the spinach and feta is a favorite. On this particular visit I opted for the falafel pita and a couple grape leaves. The falafel was good, the actually falafels were a tad dry but the tahini dressing on the sandwich definitely made up for that. And for only 4 dollars for a large sandwich, it's a good buy. The grape leaves were very well seasoned, but I have noticed a slight deterioration in quality- mainly lack of meat in the grape leave over the years. I understand it's probably a cost saving measure. But when the grape leaves are about 95% rice with tiny tiny specs of meat, I'm a little disappointed.  Still, this is a tried and true Cleveland staple for me. I recommend checking it out if you're downtown, especially if you're seeing an Indians game as its so close to the stadium!"}
{"text":"Fresh and inexpensive. Got a falafel sandwich and a small tabouli. Lot's of grocery items and fresh breads. There's a line of tables inside if you want to eat in although most people seem to take out."}
{"text":"So happy to have discovered this place!  I've been dabbling in making my own hummus lately and this place makes that process so much easier.  Chickpeas by the crate, all the tahini I could ever want and pitas galore.  Also, the prices are ridiculously low and the people who run it are friendly and knowledgeable.  My pita stash is running low so I'll be back soon.  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried their cooked food yet so as of right now this review is about their groceries only!   I have been here a few times to pick up a few items, for both myself, and my mother. The pita here is to die for, it is so fresh! Fresher than any other pita. They have a large variety to choose from based on your preference. I was there today, and I even saw the pita being made in the back, how cool!   I've also picked up other random middle eastern groceries such as canned fava beans, chick peas, olives (amazing). These are things you can get anywhere so the main thing I go for is the bread. The workers here are very pleasant and the prices are fair! I look forward to trying their homemade foods."}
{"text":"Updating because I think it's worthy...  Be sure to check ALL expiration dates!!! Half of the items I picked up today were expired or a day/few days away from expiring.  Staff was not overly friendly or helpful.  Baked goods, fresh pita and hummus are still stars (and a bargain)!!   However, I bought their tabouli and  when I got home there was a sharp wire in the mixture. I didn't see the wire... I found it when I ate a spoonful, and it cut my gum open.  Be careful, my friends.    Pistachio baklava will always have a very special place in my heart, so that is why Al's gets 3 stars."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE Grab & Go eatery.   The food, price and service can't be beat.  I love middle-eastern cuisine.  I've never had a bad experience here and the food is always fresh and delicious.  The pita and naan bread are always fresh and inexpensive compared to the grocery store.  My favorite items here are the tabouli ($2.49 for an 8oz container), hummus, pita pizzas, baklava, rolled pita sandwiches and the various salads offered in their counter display case.  I've also shopped for middle eastern items in the small grocery store attached to the eatery.   This is truly a Cleveland gem!!  Love this place:-)"}
{"text":"This place is a staple for lunches during the weekdays or before Indians games when they are open that way you avoid the overpriced less than stellar food at the game. I tend to get either the falafel or chicken shwarma wrap. Both are very tasty. I think what is best is that their homemade pita wrap is relatively thin so you taste the filling a lot more than the bread. Their hummus is excellent as well, very creamy and flavorful. Sometimes the meat in the wraps can be dry and a schmeer of hummus helps.  Fast services, low prices and tasty healthy food. It is all good at Aladdin's."}
{"text":"A lot of traffic always means good food right?! So on our way to the airport we ran into an interesting sign with many people and we stop to check it out. Best pit stop ever. I had the Greek chicken pita and enjoyed every bite."}
{"text":"How have I only been here once?  This place is wonderful, and has amazing lunch options for a ridiculously low price.  Pantry stocking: I'm a huge Aladdin's Pita fan, and it's significantly less expensive at this location than any of the other grocery.  Same with their amazing hummus!   Lunch:  The Chicken Swarm roll is a meal in itself - and for $4.99, is a great deal!  I picked up rolls for colleagues, and was told the Gyro was the best they'd ever had, and others were a fan of the Greek roll.  They are all made on large Aladdin pita's - and overstuffed with amazing grilled meat.    The store has a few tables, and it's a great spot to hit up a quick lunch.  Be prepared to wait a little bit in line - this place gets busy!"}
{"text":"Been going here since I was a kid and it's evolved over the years- but everything is just delish.  I love watching the fresh pitas come down the conveyor all puffy!   When I was little, the staff would come out and hand me a piping hot fresh one.  That, my friends, is a heavenly experience.  Great spinach pies, fresh or frozen for take home!"}
{"text":"Cleveland rocks! I might go back just to visit this place again. If for some reason you find yourself in Cleveland; be sure to stop through here."}
{"text":"Best Middle Eastern food in CLE. I love the simple things like hummus and pita and more complex items like spinach pies and shawarmas. Sooo good."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to stop by this market, but the hours seem pretty random anytime I was in the area for a game, they were closed! Well, we finally time it right last time and made a stop to pick up some sandwiches to take to the game instead of eating overpriced ballpark food. I ordered a gyro (thanks to Yelp recommendations) and got some hummus to go. The hummus was very fresh, although a little bland- will definitely go for the garlic next time. The gyro on the other hand, that was a winner! Plenty big for 2 people and very flavorful. I wish they would stay open before all baseball games, as I think they'd get a lot more business! Everything there looked so tasty, it was hard not to order one of everything!"}
{"text":"I went to Alladins today for a quick meal after the art museum, and loved it! I don't know if I was more impressed by the cheap prices or the quality of the food! I ordered a meat pie with 2 grape leaves, and my mom ordered a spinach and feta pie, all of which were delicious. Their stuffed pies are small, portable snacks that come in a variety of flavors. Also I tried some grape leaves stuffed with meat for the first time, and they were also delicious. The only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars is that the meat pies were a little cold in the center.   Also, they sell a lot of Lebanese groceries, and we picked up some of those as well. All in all, definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"I used to buy a lot of their pita products in the store. The quality varies week to week. The bread is either scorched tasting due to being excessively burned on the bottom or tastes like putty. Someone forgets to leave out an ingredient and is tasteless. I called and talked to someone about this and he really didn't care what I had to say. I used to buy 5 packages a week now I buy something else."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for healthy, fresh, quick lunchtime takeout.  The place has improved in bounds aesthetically speaking since I started going there a few years ago, but the food has been consistently great.  I'm a vegetarian and really appreciate the wide variety of veggie-friendly options, but my friends rave about the gyros and shwarma as well.  The hummus veggie rolled pita and artichoke pizza are my personal favorites.   As far as the store goes, there is no better place to buy pita, price or quality wise.  I LOVE the packs of cinnamon raisin pitas, $1.50 for six of them (slap on some peanut butter and you have breakfast covered for a week).  The place can get busy before Indian's games, but they usually move people through there pretty quickly.    Also, stick a dime in the meter out front even if you think you'll just be in there for 5 minutes!  For whatever reason they seem to police the area quite frequently and it sucks to leave the place with your yummy food only to be greeted by a $20 ticket on your car!"}
{"text":"The gyro meat was dry, pita bread was not the freshest, I ask for onions & extra cucumber sauce, didn't get either of them. The gyro was small a just handed to me wrapped in foil. I ask  do I get a bag, she responded its just a gyro. Never again will they get my money"}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma is my favorite. Also make sure to try the greek salad, baklava, pitas, and hummus. On top of how awesome the food is, the people are always nice. This is a no-frills place to get a quick lunch that is really good."}
{"text":"This is the best place you can go for anything involving pita.  Period.    As a kid, my dad would get his pita from here and not until later in life did I discover-- most people settle for inferior pita-- pita that is more than a day from the oven.  You don't know about it until you've had it fresh and you don't realize how transformative it is to everything the pita touches.  It is very convenient to park on Carnegie and just walk-in, pick-up some spinach pies, some pita, and a chicken shwarma to go.    The real deal for a reasonable price.  (Do not confuse this with the regional chain sit-down restaurant with the same name.)"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place while visiting the Rock and Roll hall of Fame.  Best falafel I've ever had.  Great mideastern grocery store.  Lots of good food --- not fancy but really, really good.  Terrific pita bread."}
{"text":"Um, yum!!! What a treasure, Cleveland!  I try to go down and get pita bread frequently enough to avoid buying it at the store. So fresh and yummy and about half the price. Can't beat it.  I am obsessed with the cinnamon raisin pitas- get yourself some!!  The grocery store has tons of little treats! Usually pick up some pita chips and yummy hummus as well. Try the hot hummus- delish!  After I peruse and load up around the store- I head for the fresh food. Yum! Love the gyro and chicken shawarma sandwiches! Usually grab a fun pita pizza for the hubs or for later.  Try the amazing sweets! Baklava is amazing. Love grabbing some kibbeh when the spirit moves. My husband once surprised me with a salad with chicken. It was the tomato/cucumber/get salad with shaved chicken on top- yum!!!!! With the fresh pita and some hummus, it was one of my favorite and freshest meals of the summer.  Don't miss this Cleveland gem!!"}
{"text":"My five star review isn't primarily about the food -- though the shawarma sandwiches and pies are cheap and reliably delicious, and the house-baked pita is among the best in the city. It's the service and the friendliness of the employees! Today a man who seemed to be confused/mentally imbalanced wandered in while loudly muttering obscenities to himself. Rather than ignoring him or treating him rudely, the lady behind the counter kindly asked him if he needed anything to eat. Seeming to momentarily regain his senses, he apologized for his rant, said thank you, and walked out of the restaurant. There were many different ways that interaction could have gone, and the staff handled it so well. I love this place."}
{"text":"The food here is good, the pita wraps and the meat pies are always a safe choice. I am very disappointed, however, to find that the Steak and Cheese Pita Wrap has been taken off of the menu. IMO it was by far and away the best wrap on their menu and for some reason it is gone. Nothing I have had since really compares and I rarely go in for lunch any more as a result. In all reality this establishment will lose about $34 in business from me this year as a result but it's too bad. I hope to hear its back one day."}
{"text":"Perfect grab n' go lunch option.    I drive right past here around 12:30 and always get a parking spot right in front.  I'll get a foil wrapped schwarma or gyro and a couple pita pizzas or spinach pies for later and out before my dime runs out of the parking meter.    Might be off the beaten path for downtown businesses, but it seems people always make their way there.  Good for me, so I don't have to fight for a parking spot.  It's always nice to get something fast and reasonably priced and not feel like a huge fatass."}
{"text":"Great Market for all you need, always fresh baked pies and bread. Love Aladdins bakery  If only they open beyond 6 pm !"}
{"text":"Bought Tabouli Salad today from them.  Im disappointed at the fact that whoever made it, packaged it, without tasting or checking if they put Olive Oil, Lemon and salt.  It was awful.  Just chopped veggies without a dressing.  Very dry.  From here on out I wont be going to Aladdins.  Can't risk paying for something with such inconsistency."}
{"text":"There are plenty of mediocre lunch options downtown. Aladdin's Bakery is a good option. The food is cheap and you don't have to feel guilt about eating something bad for you. All of the typical middle eastern dips are available for sale and the pita is fresh as can be. The hummus is pretty good and a decent price. The grape leaves are hit or miss. They also have gyro, chicken shawarma and little pita pizzas. The dining area is very limited. It is better to grab the food to go. They also have a small section that features middle eastern grocery items and cheeses. It is always a great idea to venture off the beaten path of downtown, walk past a depressing cemetery, watch a bum grab flowers from a grave plot, attempt to sell them to an office worker and then you end up eating food at Aladdin's Baking Co."}
{"text":"I am thoroughly perplexed by all the glowing reviews. I ordered hummus, baba, tabouli, and veg grape leaves through grubhub. The tabouli was the only decent item. The grape leaves were hard, dry, and inedible. Totally disgusting. Baba was also the worst I've had anywhere in town. The hummus was ok, but Sabra from the supermarket is better. Maybe all the items other than the ones I ordered are good. Never goin' back."}
{"text":"Given this place's enduring status as a Cleveland favorite, I was disappointed by my takeout order. The hummus was bland, and at least some varieties had preservatives, which surprised me, given that I was buying straight from the source.  The mujadara was wet and gloppy, and the fattoush salad came with a red-hued dressing that tasted far more minty than lemony. The tabouli, however, was fabulous, with loads of fresh parsley and proper hints of garlic and lemon. Service and selection were fine."}
{"text":"Had the gyro on a fresh baked pita for lunch. One if the best gyros I have had. Very filling and only like $5. Way better than the Subway down the street for lunch."}
{"text":"I've tried this place a handful of times, never really quite satisfied, but I keep trying it because so many people rave about it.  In my opinion, they put way too much parsley in their pita wraps, it's always so overpowering. Their hummus is nothing impressive, I can find more flavorful options at the grocery store. I've tried the falafel multiple times, eaten in different variations, and it's always SO dry. Even the sauce doesn't help. The baklava, in my opinion is just a little too sweet. Basically everything I've tried here is just mediocre. I guess the good part is that it's pretty cheap, but this is typical for middle eastern restaurants like these. I also feel like most of the people working up front are very curt, not friendly at all. Last time I was there the lady seemed annoyed to even take my order.  That being said, I do really like their pitas. They are a dollar and change, so I like to buy them to use at home. Other than that though, I'd rather go to other locations for middle eastern food. The Aladdin's in Independence is better, and has more variety. Also Sittoo's is my favorite for when I'm getting take out...they are always very fast, friendly and very flavorful!"}
