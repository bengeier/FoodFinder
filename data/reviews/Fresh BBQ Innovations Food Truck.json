{"text":"What really makes this place stand out is their friendly and courteous service. I had the Duck & Bacon sausage infused with jalapeno peppers. They advised that since they are made fresh to order there is a 10-15 minute wait but it was totally worth it! They also carry a diverse selection of other infused sausages such as; Rattlesnake & Rabbit, Pheasant & Rattlesnake, and Alligator. They don't have that bad gamey taste but if you're still not feeling brave they also serve traditional pulled pork and chili verde chicken wraps. So next time you're out and see the giant blue van with a blue siren, definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"We found this new place tucked off Hayden Rd in Scottsdale near the Costco. We ordered the Smoked chicken wings and Baby back ribs. It was all really good. Reasonably priced. Great decor and good service."}
{"text":"After reading the super reviews about Fresh Barbeque Innovation (FBI), we opted to try it.  We were not disappointed.  A warm welcome from Mary when we walked in the door.  The decor is lovely, open and spacious.  The beverages are encased in a lovely wood cabinet and they also have an espresso machine.
We ordered the Brisket Hand Shredded with a side. It was delicious. No fat, tender and a generous portion. Our side was corn fritters that were the best ever. Our server Melanie was terrific, good service to accompany the delish meal.
Don't just drive bye on Hayden, stop in for a B B Q treat."}
{"text":"I hosted a small party for a high school golf team traveling to AZ for a tournament.  I contacted FBI for information and from the first conversation, I knew they were the solution for my event.  Mary was extremely helpful in coordinating all the details of the menu and timing.  As a result, the event was flawless.  Mary and JC got the orders out extremely fast and everything was absolutely delicious.  All of my guests were thrilled with their dinner and the only negative comment I heard was, \"I think I ate too much\".  Now that's a win.  I have no hesitation in the least giving FBI 5 stars."}
{"text":"The staff on the food truck is super friendly and the food is really good! I always look forward to FBI day at work :)"}
{"text":"I went to the Goodguys car show, and got two fresh healthy chicken tacos for five dollars... The owner was super pleasant and a dream to work with.  Meanwhile, other vendors were charging $68 for a cup of lemonade, or $12 for a greasy burger, with people working there that I really wouldn't want to touch my food..FBI looks like a small family run business and everything is clean and well prepared.. it looks like a tightly run ship.  Every single person that worked there seemed clean, professional, and they were all smiling! So glad that they were at the show so I could eat something quick and healthy!! Thanks!!"}
