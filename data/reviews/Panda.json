{"text":"MSG. MSG. terrible crippling migraine from the extreme use of MSG. Friendly service but that does not make up for my headache. And waste of money ordering this."}
{"text":"Formerly known as Eastern Chinese Buffet, this establishment closed for a month or so during the summer of '14 and reopened as Panda Buffet. I had always planned on going when it was Eastern Chinese Buffet, but never made it, as China Buffet King over in Green Tree always got my vote. However, the other night I was out and about with the full intention of trying it as the newly re-christened Panda Buffet.  It was a pretty underwhelming experience. I went between 7 and 8 PM and was the only person in there the majority of the time. When I was nearly finished, another person came in for some take out. There is adequate room for a good number of diners in there, but perhaps I just went during a less busy night.  The buffet is comprised of three main tables, with a fourth one scuttled off to the side. The first table had the standard fruit and dessert items. Cakes, cookies, slices of watermelon, you know the stuff. The second and third tables had the various soups and Chinese dishes, as well as the substandard American fare that plagues too many Chinese buffets. The fourth table had a sad little tray of crab legs and a couple of other items that didn't look too appetizing.  It's a pretty rinky-dink selection. I tried the wonton soup first. It was decent. The wontons were small, and the broth had decent flavor, which is more than I can say for Phong May House's wonton soup (see the review for that place for those details), I liked it enough to go back for a second bowl, but that may have also been down to the slim selection on the buffet overall.  The coconut shrimp was very good. Nice and tangy, with no fishy taste, which is always a plus at a buffet. I also enjoyed the steamed dumplings. The filling seemed to be different from the usual potsticker recipe. I couldn't tell if it was chicken, pork, or a mix of the two. Weird stuff, but another thing I had seconds of.  The General Tso's chicken's sauce is way too thick. It was similar to a thick barbecue sauce. I didn't care for it. Ditto on the egg rolls. The pork filling in them was that strange sort of minced/spiced variety. Way too overpowering. I didn't try the spring rolls, but they didn't look much better.  A big problem overall was trying to determine how long all the food on the buffet had been out. A person came out of the back and refilled the fried rice once. Nothing else was refreshed or refilled the rest of the time I was there, even though I had claimed the last of the dumplings and most of the wontons (there were four before I got my soup). The rest of the items had a sort of glazed over look to them, especially the sweet and sour sauce which looked like it may have darkened and almost got a skin going on top. Yeah. Not so great.  I doubt I'll ever go back.It's definitely cheaper by a couple bucks than China Buffet King, but the food isn't in the same class, even though it's buffet fare. The two or three things I enjoyed were decent enough, but nothing to get me to come back for those alone. Maybe some people really dig this place, but if my visit was any indication of a regular experience there, I wouldn't be surprised if Panda Buffet winds up closing as well."}
{"text":"I just walked in an hour after the posted opening time.  I'm not sure if the buffet is still an option, because there was no food on the buffet. I considered placing an order.  A woman came from the back,  but appeared to be on her phone.  For the 2 minutes I stood at the counter she never approached me or asked me if she could help.  I walked out and went to Chan An in the same complex. I was greeted at Chan An immediately and with a smile."}
{"text":"Still have a lot to improve, but decent food for the price. The one buffet to go near this area."}
{"text":"Majority are take out but the environment is better looking now. There have nice two sofa to sit for wait. A TV too!! Wish they have WiFi as well lol"}
{"text":"We first went to Chan an, but after standing for a long time, we turned around and went to Panda (both in the same plaza). We had never tried either as we are new to the area. We were not disappointed. The egg rolls are some of the best I've ever had. The crab Rangoon with sweet and sour dipping sauce was spot on. My boyfriend really enjoyed the fried rice, and I liked the white rice. His general sos was moist and sweet, but not spicy at all. My sesame chicken was pretty good and the meat was moist as well. Then as an added bonus, the manager handed us a free 2 liter to go as well. We will definitely be back to try more entrees."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but the experience was not what I had hoped for. I was happy that all \"dine-in\" orders were 10% off. I was under the impression that the buffet was a buffet all of the time. Turns out on this particular Saturday it was not buffet. Either way, food was ordered. The young man working was obviously just learning the ropes. He brought me a diet coke when it was supposed to be a Dr. Pepper...maybe he was dropping a hint lol. And the woman working forgot my rice for a moment but food was tasty once i got it all and it was relatively inexpensive. So all in all...meh"}
{"text":"Wow! Not what it used to be.  Been here twice within last few months. Very disappointed both times. Because of se situation.  Most of the food selections are empty.  You ask them to bring some out.  Eventually they do, only enough for one person.  I came here with three people.  We could not all enjoy the same dish because there was not enough. A bit of false advertising\"all you can eat buffet\" There is nothing to eat.  Its a shame because it used to be a nice little place.  If you planned to stop for lunch and fill up a container to go. Its not going to happen."}
