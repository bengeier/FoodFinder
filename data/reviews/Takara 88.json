{"text":"I ordered the lunch special - chicken teriyaki bento box. The lunch special came with miso soup, dumplings, orange slices, meat of choice, rice, and a california roll. The California roll's avocado was browning, but it didn't make the roll taste any different. It was okay. The dumplings were served at a cool/room temperature. They were definitely not warm. I didn't even touch the rice or chicken teriyaki, because the rice smelled and tasted like it sat overnight in the rice cooker. It had a musty, watery smell and taste to it. The chicken teriyaki was served with raw veggies drizzled with room temperature sauce. The veggies were not even freshly cut. It looked like the 1 carrot and the 1 broccoli was pulled from a snack veggie bag. The sauce looked disgusting because it had 2 very different, distinct colors. After one bite of the rice and chicken teriyaki I was done with the meal. The most delicious thing in my lunch were the fresh orange slices and miso soup. I took a picture of how displeasing the food looked and tasted. Sadly, Takara 88 has been consistently disappointing (previously visited and ordered unflavored sushi). I would not recommend the lunch specials or this restaurant."}
{"text":"Sushi is decent but only has regular rolls in cooked category. I didn't find many special rolls. Prices are decent. If you need a quick sushi for lunch this is a good option. I wish they would deliver though"}
{"text":"I like the food, but customer service is terrible and we got sick after eating there today. We will not go back there again!"}
{"text":"Great suschi and suschemi.  One of the best places in Madison area, and quite reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My wife Joan and I are Middleton locals. We eat out frequently in the Madison-Middleton area and have been to Takara  many times. Our dining experiences have been uniformly superb. The atmosphere, dishes and service are excellent and the price is right.  

Regarding the atmosphere, the color scheme is most relaxing to the eye and the high ceilings lead to very low noise levels.  Regarding the dishes, we have tried many.  If you arrive by 6 PM, you get a great deal on happy hour appetizers and drinks such as Sake and wine. . Our favorite appetizer is the edamame. Now onto the main dish: The extensive menu has many items which we rate as excellent. 
In addition to classical Japanese dishes such as sushi and sashimi,   there are also delicious tofu and hibachi possibilities. 

 If it is your first visit, you cannot go wrong ordering \"Sushi Deluxe.\" Delicious. I also like \"Sake Don\" which consists of salmon on a bed of rice. If you like spicy food,  the spicy salmon rolls are great.  Another favorite of mine is \"Puppy Love.\" 
After the large main dishes, if you still have room for dessert, my recommendation 
is the cappuccino cake. 

The service is generally superb. If you are a non-expert on Japanese food, the staff  will help  you navigate through the menu. In addition, the owner, Erica, visits   the tables making sure everything is going well. 

Finally as previously mentioned, the price is right. We typically have wine or sake, an appetizer, soup,  salads, main dishes and dessert for under $50. 

Great restaurant."}
{"text":"great sushi!  first class quality food.  highly capable chefs. nice by the glass wine choices. service needs some real work. we waited an hour for our food to come. soup n salad came right away."}
{"text":"We loved Takara 88!!!  friendly and sincere staff.  Matt was our waiter and he was wonderful - honest, wasn't fake-nice, and just did a great job making suggestions and taking care of us.   colors and decor inviting.  Food was fabulous - we had steamed dumplings and fried spider crab, Puppy Love roll, Badger roll - all was fabulous - some of the best sushi around.  We will definitely be eating here again, and again!"}
{"text":"I spent two hours in Takara 88. We waited ten minutes for a server to acknowledge us with water. There were people that were seated and the my left the restaurant after being neglected.  It took 30 minutes for our drinks to show up and an hour for the appetizers. After 90 minutes, my sloppy sushi rolls showed up. I ordered the \"fantastic\" roll...I wish I took a picture. I was a sloppy roll with half the ingredients on the menu missing. The fantastic roll costs $17.95 and it should be $5.50. I'm never going back...sorry Takara."}
{"text":"I love the food!! We used to go to Muramoto and the wait was all long for take out. An hour at least. Now we can order sushi online at Takara 88 and they are great and very fast. Restaurant is beautiful. Great for parties and a nice outside patio. We eat here at least once a week. Sometimes twice. The oysters are amazing and I don't usually do raw oysters. My fav rolls... \"V\" roll, puppy love, Atari roll. I even love the hibachi and fried rice! Hot sake and Sapporo are great too. The owners are very nice !"}
{"text":"Great service ....had the Tonkatsu  a lot of food for the price and exactly the same as I had in Sagamihara when I was a child."}
{"text":"Delicious rolls. Fantastic roll is the best. Service was great and wonderful atmosphere.  Cold sake options are plentiful. Salmon, tuna and unagi were fresh."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant last night and we had a solid experience.

When you first walk in, you notice the decor is very eye catching and modern. The tables are a bit small. Our server was on top of things and she was very friendly. We had four types of sushi rolls, the names escape me now but each was well made and flavorful. Just overall a great experience and worth the drive from east Madison."}
{"text":"Affordable, excellent sushi. Best quantities of raw fish in the rolls, compared to any sushi joint in the Madison area. Always fresh; no concerns in that department, which is rare. Staff is nice enough, familiar to me now. The setting is perfect with bar, formal indoor, and outdoor seating. It's beautiful inside. Great happy hour specials (beer, sake, very small plates).

It's been a long time coming for Middleton!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great sushi, great atmosphere, good service. I usually go to Whitney Way Takara but this one is much nicer and newer inside."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 3 others. We ordered the sashimi appetizer. It was standard (tuna, salmon, surf clam and crab stick wrapped in cucumber). The presentation was great. The fish is fresh. I ordered the dinner sushi & sashimi combo. I asked to substitute a spicy tuna roll instead of the California roll. I'm not a fan of the \"crab stick\" because its not crab at all. It's molded whitefish or tilapia formed into the crab like shape. Anyhow, the difference in price of the two rolls was $0.50 and they charged $2 for the sub. The fish again, was fresh. The special rolls they do seem to lack creativity and are pretty standard for sushi joints. The quality of food was good, the ambiance was nice and its clean. The wait staff was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. This is a legit spot. It'd be better with some creativity."}
{"text":"I ordered the V roll. It was fresh, delicious and creative. Spicy tuna, avocado, crab, asparagus, spicy sauce, wrapped in lettuce and then rice paper. No rice. Yum!  We will definitely be back! The service was prompt. This price was reasonable. We recommend it and will bring friends next time."}
{"text":"Great, stylish little sushi place!  Not the best in all of Madison, but still delicious, and for the price it's a great value.  Their maki is creative, the sashimi is always fresh, and the rice is well-seasoned and textured.  The waitstaff is always friendly, accommodating, and remembers us and our drink preferences whenever we come in (hot sake for the adults, ramune Japanese soda for the kids).  On Sundays and Mondays they have a great maki special: buy one specialty roll, get another roll for $1.  If you don't feel like driving all the way downtown and shelling out a hundred bucks for a marginally-better experience, then this is your place."}
{"text":"Great vegan or veggie lunch roll selection. I will definitely come back for dinner to try more. Beautiful outdoor seating. Service was good but could have been a lot warmer. Bloody Mary was fantastic - maybe my favorite in town!"}
{"text":"I ordered the sushi and shashimi platter and watched my chef make it.  I loved it but was never informed on what i was eating.  I can tell you if you sit at the bar and watch them, they are also watching you. I love the compassion of the chef - I happen to read something very sad on my facebook and cried a few tears, the poor chef didn't know what was going on. I was able to gather myself but he took the time to lean over and say, I hope you have a good night. What a sweet man!"}
{"text":"Amazing - by far the freshest, best sushi in Madison. The rolls are HUGE, balanced flavor, packed with deliciousness. Intricate, wonderful sushi. The servers and owners are kind and engaging."}
{"text":"Loves the atmosphere and friendly staff. The sushi was better than some of the other \"high end\" sushi restaurants in the area at a much more reasonable cost. We will be back a lot."}
{"text":"Sushi was great and cool atmosphere... I was looking to relax and enjoy a nice long dinner... My only issue was that eating alone I ordered appetizers and sushi, and hibachi chicken, asking for them to hold the order on the hibachi... Twice.  Unfortunately they didn't listen and brought out the sushi, appetizer, soup, salad and chicken hibachi all at once.  Feeling rushed since it was getting cold cause I couldn't eat it all at once...  So I ended up eating the hibachi cold...  Then to top it off, some of the chicken in the hibachi tasted very spoiled and I had to spit it out it was so bad...  I couldn't finish the cold spoiled hibachi... I also asked for red ginger sauce for the hibachi and they didn't know what I was talking about...  They said they thought I was talking about Chinese food... (Face Palm at this point)

I would go here for the sushi and sake, but that's it..."}
{"text":"Takara is okay. It's a solid three stars. I don't find anything phenomenal about it, but there's nothing really bad, either.

I've done takeout a few times from Takara, and I've dined in once. Out of all of these experiences, my least favorite was the dine-in experience. The service at the restaurant was a slow, even though the restaurant was not crowded, and the restaurant itself was extremely cold. I avoided drinking my water simply because it would make me even colder.

We ate at the restaurant on a Friday night during the 7 o'clock hour, and maybe a quarter of the seats were even filled. I doubt that can be a good sign.

The sushi at Takara is pretty good, although I've had a some rolls on a few occasions that I felt smelled and tasted a little fishier than good quality sushi should. 

There are several places in Madison that offer a better dining experience -- as far as the service, restaurant atmosphere and sushi quality altogether -- when it comes to sushi. Takara isn't bad, but it just doesn't fit the bill for me."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for lunch after a massage next door at Elements. We were pleased to see a Sunday special featuring buy one get one for $1 sushi rolls. We enjoyed a few rolls as well as a few pieces of fresh sashimi (priced individually but generously sized) and miso soup. All was tasty, fresh, and beautifully presented. Will definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"We brought a group of 9 to celebrate a birthday and while we were seated right away, it took a very long time to be served drinks and ultimately our meals. The food was decent but not the best sushi I've had. I've had better experiences at the other Takara restaurant on the east side of Madison."}
{"text":"I felt compelled to write a review to help negate some of the negative ones for this restaurant. I too, have eaten sushi on both coasts.  I had a very good meal here. The sushi was fresh and well presented, and the portions were good. Everything we tried was very well prepared, with good flavors. Service was friendly and attentive, and prices were reasonable, especially after having had sushi in Manhattan.  I would definitely recommend Takara 88, especially after an arduous Costco run."}
{"text":"Had high hopes, sadly disappointed.  Spicy rolls were not spicy,  tempura roll was albino (shrimp was not browned just soggy) and the California roll was all mayo, it could have been the crap in a Subway \"seafood salad\" sub.  Bummed that it was sub par."}
{"text":"Mmmm....this place was delish! We came with some friends almost near closing time, but their service was still attentive and the food quality and presentation did not seem rushed. 

The Chirashi dish completely satisfied my sashimi cravings. It. Was. Amazing. And surprisingly still filling! We ordered three additional rolls, whose names escape me (because I should've written this sooner), that were also all satisfying. 

Our friends ordered one of the bento box meals, which was plentiful. The only complaint was that the plate didn't really look like a bento box - but that's not a deal breaker. 

Very impressed with this place!"}
{"text":"Came in very happy coz found pictures of fresh uni on the menu :) 
Look .... any p?ace that has hamachi collar on the menu it's a good shot that the chef knows what he is doing ... 
And I was right 
Grate place very nice service ! 
Great people and its fresh !!!
You will love it I guarantee it !"}
{"text":"Had a delicious meal there about a month ago. I had tempura shrimp and my friend had salmon. Both meals were served hot and delicious on the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Nice convenient location in Middleton. We were greeted by a very friendly man and our server was sweet. The happy hour wine is 2.50$ which is amazing and the wine is good enough especially at that price. If you go on Sunday or Monday you pay full price for a roll and 1$ for another! Get the puppy love, lobster tempura roll and the spicy shrimp crunch roll!  Puppy love was the best of the night I'd come back just for that. We also got the fashion roll which was pretty good and some nigiri. If they have toro it was delicious. Vegetable tempura appetizer was tasty as well. Miso soup just so so. But overall I enjoyed it and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Heard not so good things but food was EXCELLENT... Anyone who appreciates a great wine selection and fresh sushi should visit soon!!! Hope you're coming to Waunakee Soon!!"}
{"text":"I ate here last night with two coworkers while attending a training conference. The interior was nice. The staff was friendly. This is where the good ends.

One coworker ordered a bento box and only ate a couple bites and pushed it away. He refused a to go box and just told us it was terrible. My other coworker ordered two Godzilla rolls. What he got wasn't  a Godzilla roll and was unidentifiable. He even posted it up on Facebook asking his friends what it was. He ate about three pieces and left the rest.

My own was an udon plate with beef. It was bad. The beef was over cooked and tough. The udon was overcooked. The onions and mushrooms with it was a slimy mass.

The price points for these items was a little ridiculous. The Bento was $20. The two not Godzilla rolls were $15 each and my udon was $12. I live in Reno so I may be a little sushi spoiled. Most of our places are all you can eat for $16-18 for lunch or $20-23 for dinner and it's better quality. Even ala carte items are nowhere near the same cost for specialty rolls.

Other conference attendees have reported good sushi experiences. This place is clearly not one of them."}
{"text":"While I was home visiting family my sister asked her if I wanted to meet her for lunch at Takara 88. Now I'm not a New York snob when it comes to sushi but I typically don't go for sushi when I'm in Wisconsin, mostly because there are so many other things that I want to eat. 

This sushi was good and made fresh, overall I really enjoyed the food. My issue was with the service, it was pretty slow. When we ate lunch the restaurant was relatively empty but yet my sister and I waited a decent amount of time for our sushi, about 20 minutes. 

I would go back, but I'm not going to rush there."}
{"text":"Madison area has a lot to offer in terms of food but so far my sushi experience here has been underwhelming...spoiled forever by Californian sushi as pretentious as it sounds. That is why finding a place with fresh melt-in-your-mouth yellowtail belly and inventive rolls that have proper fish to rice ratio was like a little victory to me! I'm a regular now."}
{"text":"I had this dream where a guy who looked a lot like Will Smith from Men In Black kept telling me to pick up the phone. Except there's no phone around. I'm in like a doctor's waiting room. I don't see any doors, it's  just some chairs and a coffee table. He starts yelling at me to pick up the dang phone. I'm like \"Dude what phone? I loved you in Fresh Prince of Bel-Air but there's no phone!\"

So I'm like looking around and under my chair is the phone. It's that toy phone like from the Powerpuff Girls. It's not ringing but I pick it up. I put it to my head but I don't say hello, I just listen. There's a faint rustle, like autumn leaves blowing down a lonely road. I put the phone down, but the sound doesn't stop. I keep looking for the source of the sound and I can't find it. It's not coming from the chairs or the table or any of the weird magazines lying around, but it keeps getting louder and louder when suddenly...

I wake up in a jolt.

My girlfriend is standing over me. She's rubbing together two pieces of seaweed paper. A little bit of drool dribbles out of the upturned corner of her mouth and she says, in a hollow and dangerous tone, \"suuuu... shiiii...\"

So yeah, it's pretty good and on Mondays they have buy one roll get the other one for $1 (it's a limited selection for the dollar rolls)."}
{"text":"Disappointing, sorry to say. The soup was served lukewarm. The Yaki Udon with chicken was below par; the chicken was dry and tough, the vegetables were small and hard to find, and the entire dish seemed steamed rather than pan-fried. The sauce was just ok. I've had much better Yaki Udon, including at the State St. location. The Hibachi Steak had pretty good flavor. But I've never seen a Hibachi meal like this. Everything -- the shrimp, meat, and vegetables -- all came swimming together in a large pool of sauce. And here I thought that presentation is such an important part of Japanese food. The folks at Takara must know better than this. I'd go back if I knew that Takara was going to take their food more seriously, and serve it with more pride."}
{"text":"Good sushi for the price you pay. Sunday/Monday deals are worth it, as well as the happy hour alcohol specials."}
{"text":"The portions are on the small side of average, but the fish tastes fresh and the staff is pleasant and helpful. I love the lunch deal of 2 rolls for $10 for a quick, light, healthy feeling meal. The miso soup is less flavorful than I've had elsewhere, though, so I usually skip that."}
{"text":"Great set-up. Everything felt so good and comfortable in there. The food is undeniably fresh and well prepared. The chicken teriyaki  had set a new standard for my taste."}
{"text":"Fantastic roll was the best roll out of the three I tried. With raw salmon, spicy tuna,shrimp, avocado and eel, the flavors were rich and fresh. 
Fashion roll came in second fave with fresh raw salmon, shrimp and avocado wrapped in seaweed. 
Third runner up was the Fancy Salmon Roll which was disappointing, because I personally love deep fried rolls and this one was very generous with the cream cheese and I wished the chef's special sauce was more of a sweet and spicy rather than the wasabi cream-like sauce. 
Overall service was good. Atmosphere is open, modern, clean and spacious. 
Happy Hour is M-Th & Sun 4:30-6:30 for house wines, hot sake, import/domestic beer, apps and salads. 

Give it a try!"}
{"text":"For as slammed as they were, the wait staff kept checking in on me and kept me updated with my order, total time was 40 minutes from order to table but they were SLAMMED, and being in no rush and working in restaurants before I understood, can't say much for the other patrons but they were hauling ass behind the kitchen and the sushi chefs didn't sacrifice quality for trying to get orders out. Definitely worth the wait. I only wish the other patrons didn't give them a hard time for the long wait. Sushi is an art and food sushi requires attention to detail. Good job guys. I came in May 12, 2018."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4.5, and the only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star is because we have Red in Madison. Anyways, this place continues to impress me! Been here twice in the last few months, and it's just an all around excellent place.

On Sundays and Mondays, if you order a specialty roll, you can get a small sushi roll for $1. My friend and I ended up getting 6 rolls for not much more than $23/person with this deal! 

Their rolls were above average as well! Definitely a bit on the smaller side, but they give you a lot and the quality is better than what I would expect. 

Overall, this place is definitely worth checking out for sushi lovers. They have a huge menu too if you're not feeling sushi!"}
{"text":"Convenient lunch spot. There were only a couple people in here for lunch allowing us to quickly get a table and order.
I was a little wary of ordering ocean fish from a sushi place in the mid-west but nowadays all the fish are instantly frozen when they are caught.
I ordered the chicken hibachi with a toro sashimi side. The chicken hibachi was tasty and nicely savory. The toro sashimi was kind of a mess. The sashimi was falling apart and kind of sloppily arranged.
I understand competition out here is not very fierce and the restaurant was not packed but the sushi chef needs to try a little harder."}
{"text":"I have been very excited to try this place. The ambiance of place is great. Unfortunately, the wait was absolutely ridiculous. After we arrived, more groups arrived. People that ordered after us were getting their orders first. Our waitress seems very new. We reached out to someone about how we had been waiting 30 minutes for our food. Within a couple of mins our food arrived. It was delicious. 

Try to get there before the rush to avoid delays."}
{"text":"Great little casual place for a date night! 
The sushi seemed fresh and beautiful. The decor is hip and trendy, yet welcoming. The prices are decent. The staff take forever getting to you once you sit down, but once you're finally acknowledged, the service is just fine. 

I would give 5 stars but I think it's kinda shitty that they offer a coupon, but don't tell you it's only for the week days. So when you're there on the weekends, don't bother asking."}
{"text":"Badger roll and Wasabi Stringer are excellent rolls!! Great sushi and nice atmosphere. I make it a point to get here anytime I'm in the Middleton area."}
{"text":"We were very impressed by their sushi! ???????????????? ???/????????????????????????
Perfectly cooked/seasoned sushi rice... Ingredients used were fresh!! Good job :)!"}
{"text":"I went here to eat and drink with my aunt and uncle. We sat at the bar and service was good. We felt that the food was excellent, especially for sushi in Wisconsin. We really enjoyed the soft shell crab appetizer and the nigiri. Price was very reasonable and draft beer was large!"}
{"text":"Fresh and beautiful raw fish! I tried the chirashi, which included salmon, tuna, crab, shrimp, egg, octopus, clams, and some unknown fish. It tasted great! It's also a very good deal :)
Should have tried the salmon belly and sweet shrimp and uni, but I was already too full after my dinner. 
They also have nice happy hour deals!"}
{"text":"I got 4 sushi rolls and miso soup to split for a take-out lunch. The woman taking our order was very pleasant and even let us know we would save money doing one of the lunch sushi specials. 
I cannot speak to the atmospere or ambiance as we did take out but it looked nice and clean from what I saw.
I must say, I wasn't very impressed with the sushi. :(
In fact I doubt I would ever order sushi there again. We ordered a spicy tuna roll, a spicy shrimp tempura roll, a tuna and yellowtail roll, and an eel and avocado roll. None of them were very good. 
Maybe their udon is better?
To sum it up, I will not be ordering sushi here again but I would try other menu items if I find myself craving udon or soba noodles."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  When I arrived I told them I had a wheat allergy.  It wasn't until my food was brought to me that they told me there was wheat in the rice and that half the food I ordered wasn't safe for me to eat.  The only positive thing I can say is that the waitress brought me gluten free soy sauce."}
{"text":"This place was a welcomed surprise after being turned away from the restaurant across the street. A clean and welcoming environment, made even better by generous portions and fresh-tasting sashimi's. The food presentations were on point! The salad and miso appetizers were well done, and with a YELP check-in you get a free order of edamame. Their bento boxes come in a unique four-squared-pod that's unlike other other bento boxes I've seen. Their prices were definitely reasonable, some might say a steal! I really enjoyed the three roll special for $13. I really enjoyed my Spicy Tempura, New York, and Alaska rolls! I did however have food envy though for the Pork Donburi that my sister ordered. Pro-Tip: Order as a group to get more variety in the dishes you can taste!"}
{"text":"We frequently visit Takara's Westside location and thought to give this one a try for dinner. We came on a Sunday and were pleasantly surprised to see they had a special for buying a specialty roll and then you get a simpler roll for a $1. 

The atmosphere is nice, definitely better decorated and more inviting then their Westside location. They also have a nice bar off to the left for drinks. The service was very friendly and fast. We tried the wasabi stinger roll which was really good. My husband also had their volcano roll which he enjoyed. We also got the spicy tuna, vegetable tempura, and  crunchy shrimp; all of which we've had before at the other location. They are also pretty good but pretty standard. The taste was also consistent of the other location which was nice.

We usually only get Takara for lunch because it can get pricey but we may come back to this location for dinner for the nice ambiance and sushi special."}
{"text":"The soba noodle lunch special was great! More food than you would expect for $9 and a good quality as well. The spicy tuna roll had good flavor and presentation. Overall, a place I will be returning to ASAP!"}
{"text":"I grabbed some sushi on my way back to Verona from Middleton a couple weeks ago.  It was an okay experience.

I ordered three rolls, (don't remember the names), but two of them were special rolls and were $10 and $14, pretty expensive sushi rolls.  The more expensive rolls were definitely not worth the money.  The rolls were about 6 pieces of thin sushi rolls, not recommended.

The service was nice and accommodating though.

All in all, I won't be grabbing sushi from here.  Definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"I usually get the lunch special of two or three rolls and soup. Very reasonable price for what you get & It's always delicious. Love that I can order online. Id say I go here about once a week."}
{"text":"I have always been very pleased with the food at Takara...I rave about it every chance I get and I've brought several friends and family members there who were pleasantly surprised. I didn't even know I liked sushi until about a year ago and now I eat it at least once a week...and Takara is by far the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Great place for pickup, I do their sushi 2-roll lunch special and am always happy with that they serve. 

If you take their sushi to-go, be smart and get the salad rather that the soup (warmed up sushi can be off putting). 

I love the ginger dressing on the salads, it tastes like it could be house made. The miso soup is generic, but the sushi entrees outweigh my love of miso soup."}
{"text":"I was excited to see something go into the spot in Cayuga Court because nothing seems to last...and having a sushi place in Middleton was exciting.   We went on a Wednesday evening and were surprised to see it packed with people.  The redesigned interiors are fantastic and we got a table right away. Overall our service was very slow but the food was great! I had the beef sukiyaki and it was delicious.  We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Upon walking in the establishment you will notice the restaurant to be well decorated and spacious. The food was well presented. The freshness of the sushi is questionable. The tuna that I received smelled and the quantity of sashimi was disheartening. They like to use a lot of artificial crab. My guest became ill shortly after eating there and my stomach felt off as well. I usually eat at Takumi on the east side of Madison and was expecting more from this place being as it is in Middleton. I will continue to stick with Takumi on the east side and Muramoto in Hilldale."}
