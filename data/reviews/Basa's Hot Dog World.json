{"text":"Happy to have finally tried Basa's. The beef empanada was so delicious. Also tried the chocolate covered alfajore which was as good as I remember from Argentina. Looking forward to going back and tasting more from the menu."}
{"text":"This is a true hidden gem of Corso Italia. I don't know exactly what they do to make their hot dogs taste so good, but this is the ultimate comfort food. They have various latin inspired hot dogs, with unusual ingredients such as hickory sticks. My favorite is the Brazilian hot dog, pictured in the profile. The owners are super nice and provide excellent service. My husband and I always crave a basa's hot dog. Their empanadas are very tasty also."}
{"text":"I loved this place! Went with a group of my ESL students and the food was awesome! Great price and delicious! The owners were so sweet and so accommodating. Definitely worth checking out!!"}
{"text":"It's a Brazilian spot. They have different kinds of filling by nationalities, but the style of the sandwiches are Brazilian. All ingredients fresh and the hamburger is home made. They also have empanadas argentinas and the famous \"coxinha\" from Brazil, that is so tasty and fried at the time you order. Delicious!  You can find the best sauce you could ever imagine, we call it \"green sauce\" (molho verde, in Portuguese), it is a home made mayo with herbs, amazing to eat with sandwiches.  They also have guaraná, paçoca, bubaloo, pão de mel, sonho de valsa, serenata de amor.. all this names are products from Brasil, and if you don't know, go there and try everything! Since I'm living in Toronto I have been trying to find good places to buy passion fruit or at least the juice and I can never really find. But there they have a delicious passion fruit juice, I really loved!  The place is too small but they have delivery from uber eats. The place is clean and the people are really kind and nice! I would recommend you to go there and try it all!"}
{"text":"So I'm that guy that asks for the staff's recommendation (which was the Brazilian burger with the fried egg on top) and promptly ignores it!  In the end the Argentine Gaucho burger was pretty good, nice chimichurri and friend onions, more please!  But the milkshake was definitely skippable.  This place is more like a hamburger counter - there really isn't much else here other than burgers and hotdogs and a loneley empanada or two.  So make sure you're only up for a snack or that you order more than one."}
{"text":"Ordered a take out earlier this week. Hot Dog was really amazing, especially the Mexican. Yummy!"}
