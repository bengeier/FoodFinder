{"text":"This place tries really hard to be pretentious....  We had the prosciutto pizza, and also the mushroom pizza.  The crust was thin, but had the texture and taste of cardboard.  The toppings were minimal to barely existent.  Hardly any sauce and scant toppings.  Not what I wanted when paying around $20 for a pizza.  Overall, it was bland and boring, out of the three of us there, no one liked it.  We didn't even finish the mushroom pizza, just couldn't stomach it.  Ended up going elsewhere for some dessert.  Blah, never again."}
{"text":"Very happy to have Una a short walk away, as the food is quite good.  I had an amazing summer risotto here once, & the fresh pasta dish currently on the menu is yummy. The fresh pasta texture is very obvious, & the sauce is wonderful. Also, the fleur de sel caramel gelato is worth every penny. Exceptional! Especially the mouth feel. 

The pizza is very good, enough so that we have ordered it for take out more than once. (if you don't like thin crust pizza, then just stop reading here) One recurring problem is way too much oil added as a topping - when it makes the entire pizza box soggy, or leaves huge pools on your plate in the restaurant, then maybe the kitchen should dial it back a bit. Mind you, this doesn't happen every time, & not every type of pizza on the menu involves drizzled oil.  

They need to bring back the Cajun pizza! Amazing hot pepper combo. 

Wine list is decent & I really like their house red as an affordable glass of vino (both house wines are apparently blended exclusively for Una). But I grew up with acidic red wine so that works better for me than for some people. I'm that weirdo who uses reds recommended for steak dinners as sipping wine, so be warned.  

Not very happy with the \"no reservation\" policy, as it is quite onerous for people with mobility issues. No, I can't expend extra energy walking to a bar a block or two away so I can wait an hour for a table to open up, then walk back. I honestly can't imagine that the policy is more efficient than taking reservations, as people must bail either way (if you follow their Twitter feed you will see that this happens a lot) Usually, I just plan on going elsewhere. 

Otherwise, I generally end up at Una in the afternoon, when you are almost guaranteed to get a table. On the few occasions I have eaten here at night, I either send my partner to see if there is a table then have him text me, or I show up ridiculously early, like before 5:30. 

Accessibility - door has a step but that is ok because only a child sized wheelchair might have a chance in here. The place is ridiculously cramped, so much so that if I sit on the bench side my dining partner has to pull out the table for me to be able to get up using my cane. Once we sat at the bar, & our chairs were whacked so hard so many times we have vowed not to sit there again during rush hours. There is apparently just not enough room for staff to pass by between the bar & tables; they have no choice but to jar your chair. I haven't been back to the washroom in years but it's so difficult to get there if you are in a wheelchair that its inner accessibility is really not relevant.

Vegetarian options - yes! They usually have a veg special pizza these days in addition to the regular menu, & there is usually at least one more main no-meat dish on the menu (such as the fresh pasta). However, I worry about how careful they are with keeping vegetarian food vegetarian, given that the last time I expressly asked for my leftovers to be packed separate from the meat, we got everything slapped together in one box. It's pretty annoying to pay for a whole pizza then only get to eat half. Yes, the pizza is tasty enough to be annoyed about this! :)"}
{"text":"MMM MMM MMM! I think this was the most silent meal I've eaten with a group of people because we were all too busy inhaling the pizza. These pizza's were amazing!

We ordered two 4-maggi's, a Sausage and a Prosciutto. Every single slice devoured in our bellies. We started off with the meatballs. They were also equally wonderful. I couldn't have asked for a better meal. 

The 4-maggi was my favourite I think it was for our whole table since they were the first to be finished. Must have been that truffle oil that was oh so savoury and it complemented the cheese so well.

The only reason they lost a star was we had a big group which is fine our male wait staff were wonderful and accommodating and at one point all of us were sitting on each other's laps cause we didn't have enough space. What I didn't like was the snarky and rude comments being made by one of the other staff members. We were having fun we didn't mind that we had to wait longer to get a bigger table. (We had more people join us then expected, it went from 4 of us to 6.) We didn't care we were enjoying our wine and having a great time waiting for the chef's table. The comments were totally not needed from the one staff member though. I think it was none of her concern since she wasn't the one taking care of our table in the first place. 

Love this place though I will be back as much as I can before I move away from the city!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Pizza... had the mushroom ..   can mix great drinks also... !  will be back"}
{"text":"PIZZA!!!
After all the talk I  had to break down and check out this place. Our small group arrived at 515 on a Thursday, and every table was full by 530!
Very cute small place with an open kitchen. Everything that came out looked and smelled Soo good!
We decided on the arugula and also he Swiss chard pizza. The arugula was the hit! Super light and fresh. Best pizza with arugula I have tasted in Calgary since it's fresh and non-wilted. Maybe a touch on the salty side from the prosciutto  and freshly grated cheese. But we didn't complain.
The Swiss chard had lots of super smokey bacon and was very rich. Almost too rich in comparison to the arugula pizza.
Crust on both super thin and crisp. Almost too hard in places. Personal preference of less hard crust as in double zero.
Service was great!! Also think pizza sells itself. I will be back for more...."}
{"text":"Best take out I've ever had!!   We ordered a pizza,  cauliflower,  and ceasar salad for delivery and it looked and tasted just as delicious as it would if we were sitting in a nice restaurant.  The kale ceasar salad is awesome and made with quality ingredients. This place is definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"U is for unbelievably amazing
N is for nice and relaxing atmosphere, mixed with a pinch of fun and hoppin'
A is for absolutely worth it


Imagine chatting it up with a friend/business owner a few stores down from UNA telling them about the amazing pizza you just devoured with your friend. Your friend jumps in and advertises your obvious passion for the pizza and how your practically begged to go there....THEN...you leave the scene. Later you find out the owner of UNA was standing there all along waiting for help from your friend/business owner. HAHA...how fun. Good thing I don't get embarrased!

The funny thing is I have never been one to LOVE pizza...I always found it...meh. Well...this has all changed thanks to the little shop on 17th called UNA. In fact pizza has now become a regular part of my  vocabulary....shocking for those who know me, and perhaps those who do not. :P

On a serious note...please do yourself a favor and go try the margharita pizza. Make sure you add cherry tomatoes AND you order a side of olives. If you are disappointed I will personally accept all blame.....please write to me and I will offer my condolences. And maybe suggest option B (Famoso Pizza) 

Thank you UNA pizza!
Ps. I LOVE the different displays of art and funky music. One time there was a recording of a man's voice talking about love in a way like no other...I wanted to stay in the washroom to hear every bit. So thought provoking. But not enough to get my mind off the pizza :)"}
{"text":"Was here for lunch the other week with a couple other people.  So I got to try 3 different kinds of pizza.  Two were so so at best, but the 4 cheese pizza was amazing.  I had heard a lot of good things about this place, but it wasn't great by any stretch.  Very overpriced in my opinion.  Pulicinella in Kensington is much better.
Service was ok.  Not sure why, but the place just gives off a pompous vibe.  Not my deal at all."}
{"text":"I am totally picky nicky when it comes to pizza - my taste leans towards a thin crust, more European style pizza.  That being said, I LOVED everything about Una Pizza + Wine.  

A group of 12 of us went here for a work lunch last week - all for the first time.   A few people belly ached about the prices, thinking that we each needed our own.  Our table of 6 ordered 4  pies and that was perfect; therefore, in my opinion the prices are quite reasonable.  

K, the pizza was sooo good - the best I've had in Calgary.  My favourite was the prosciutto pizza closely followed by the mushroom.  All 12 of us were happy with the food & it was a really nice lunch.  I should also mention that the service was great - the pizza came quickly and the server was constantly switching them up when she spotted an empty tray.

The atmosphere is nice - it's a long and narrow restaurant and whoever decorated has great taste (right down to the sugar cookie soap in the bathroom).  One girl in our party commented that it was a little too trendy for her tastes.  But, for me, if trendy is clean, pretty, and awesome, bring it on! 

All in all, a great experience and I cannot wait to return for more :)"}
{"text":"Things that make UNA great:
-very trendy feel and location, the atmosphere and attention to overall design are splendid
-It was open till midnight on a Friday night when I went, made quite the classy post-bar meal... 

What to wear: on the more casual end of dressy"}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say (besides the wait, but hey its expected) but I'm also lacking in amazing things to say. I tend to judge everywhere based on their mussels. UNAs' mussels? The best i've had in years. But thats really the only thing that stood out to me. Pizza was almost boring. Service was good, no complaints but again nothing spectacular. The vibe was a great balance of over-crowded and feeling like your somewhere everyone wants to be. Maybe thats what the hype is all about, everyone wants to feel like they are part of the local foodie crowd."}
{"text":"Exactly what 17th Ave needed! Reminds me of in dinning San Fran or New York - small, casual, fresh, chef driven with the owners on the floor.

Pizza prepared to perfection: a light dough, thin crust, super fresh ingredients and perfectly cooked in a proper pizza oven - YUMMY! 

Fantastic wine list."}
{"text":"One of the best finds ever!!  Absolutely amazing food and a very friendly and inviting atmosphere.

Close your eyes point one of meal on menu and choose,you won't be disappointed. Anything you choose, you will find here with great quality and good service.

All in all, great food. Everything I've eaten here so far has been super tasty!"}
{"text":"We were asked to leave the bar due to no fault of our own!
We put our name on the list and asked the hostess if we could sit at the bar until ready.  Half a beer in, the manager \"asked\" (really told us) to drink our beer in the tiny cramped entrance of the restaurant as the bar was for people ordering pizza. REALLY? I explained the conversation I had with the hostess and the manager insisted we vacate the bar.
We left the restaurant, beers unfinished and astonished of such terrible treatment of patrons.
If you want a pizza in a hugely busy place with condescending staff, look no further and enjoy the offerings of this well below average establishment.
BTW the wine list is nothing special."}
{"text":"The pizza was good - but not as good as the hype builds it up to be. It wasn't anything special. We ordered the prawn appetizer which was surprisingly sweet, and the waiter was nice enough to bring us extra bread. The peanut buttter chocolate terrine dessert was underwhelming. Overall it was a good meal, but for the price, the wait and the crowd the value wasn't really there."}
{"text":"WOW that is some really fantastic pizza! Came here early on a Sunday afternoon, the place was starting to get busy. I can see why everyone wants to eat here. We started off with the toasted sourdough bread with jalapeno oil and salt. OMG I love sourdough but this just took it to a whole new level. It was like heaven in my mouth. Nicely toasted tasting super fresh and the oil gives it just a little bit of heat. I highly recommend it.

Next we had the Tiki pizza again I was blown away how amazing it was. Crispy prosciutto, thinly shaved pineapple, jalapeno, cheese. Wow I want more just thinking about it. An excellent balance between the sweet from the pineapple and spicy from the jalapeno. You really need to order it.

The only reason I took off a star was because we got a half liter of sangira and it cost twice as much as the pizza. It was alright but not worth the hefty price tag. Also our server was just alright, nothing really memorable."}
{"text":"Top-notch service, awesome food. Their 4-maggi and kale salad... drool."}
{"text":"I thought the pizza was delicious!!  We had pepperoni and mushroom, but my father thought the pizza was spicy.  Chopped salad was spicy but also delicious.  Topped of our meal with a Key Lime pie...YUMMY!!"}
{"text":"Was invited on a date here, and I definately would recomend it for small groups, like 2...up to 4 max. It's small, but well designed to get more out of the space than what it used to be, which was the Wicked Wedge. 

For early evening, it was respectable busy, and it wasn't a long wait for our table. Although I do hear later in the evening, around 7pm, it gets hard to just walk in and get a table quickly. The decor reminded me of a little eatery I went to it Harlem, NYC (yes, I was in Harlem, no it's not dangerous) - so bonus points for that.

UNA brings you small carafe's of Q water - as if regular water isn't good enough! - but it is much cheaper than brand name waters.

I ordered a lycheetini, which common sense tells you is a lychee martini, which quickly made me light headed, in a good way, but it's a good thing the pizzas we ordered were on time! The pizzas were both amazing. If you like thin crust, Italian style pizza, this is your place.

 I would say pricing for two, without liquor runs at $25-30 per person.

For dessert we shared a creamy panna cotta, which hit the spot.

All in all this is a great place. Just a note, if you want good pizza in a swanky, slightly hipster environment, this is for you. If you're less into the 'scene' and want a cheaper, more DIY version of the above, minus the 'special' water, then go to Famoso Neapolitana nearby on 4th street.

Ah yes, they get extra points for the wicked music playing in the washroom."}
{"text":"We finally had a chance to stop in at UNA for lunch today. It definitely lived up to the hype! My husband and I shared the sausage pizza, a baby gem lettuce salad, and finally the peanut butter + chocolate terrine.

Everything was delicious and fresh. The service was friendly and attentive and there is a great vibe to the place. It's fun without being pretentious. You get the feeling that you could ask your server what \"friulano\" is without anyone looking down their nose at you. The pink peppercorn dressing on the salad was as good as it sounds and I loved the fennel sausage.

Maybe strange for a pizza place, but the peanut butter + chocolate terrine blew my MIND. It was sooo good. It had house made marshmallow on top and roasted peanuts. It was heaven. Order it, you won't regret it! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Overrated. Luckily the service was great because the pizza was greasy and soggy in the center and the tables were jam packed together."}
{"text":"Very over rated. Had big expectations but at the end just another pizzeria with bad service."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had. Great atmosphere, great service, good portion sizes and reasonably priced. My favorite food spot in Calgary."}
{"text":"This place is definitely on the top 10 list for calgary's great casual dining places - it has a hip atmosphere and good service without really being pretentious. Best part is that they are open late - it's always nice to be able to get a nice glass of wine and some appetizers late in the evening.

The best pizza i've tried there is the Formaggio. It has the perfect balance of flavors and aromatic cheese. Some of their other ones are somewhat lacking in flavor and punch, but the crust is pretty faultless. The appetizers - meatballs, steak, etc - are good for sharing and are pleasant, but nothing mind-blowing. 

However, their cheesecake with strawberry compote WAS mind-blowing. It came in a little mason jar with graham crumble at the bottom, was rich and cheesy, and the compote was perfect. 

Their menu changes occasionally and there is usually a daily special pizza and an appetizer. The \"no-reservations\" policy sucks. Some nights there are long lineups but usually not bad after 9:30."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Great kale salad. Pair it with some wine and your evening will be one for the books. A cool spot for a date, or for a squad gathering. 
No resos, so make sure you plan and go early."}
{"text":"I'm totally fan of their pizza and the best part about this place is the environment, highly recommended place for pizza lovers plus if you wanna grab a drink smtime then they've an impressive list."}
{"text":"UNA is my favorite dinner place in Calgary. Amazing food, service and ambiance! Great gluten-free options and extremely catering to anyone with dietary restrictions.

Be sure to make a reservation -- this place fills up fast on the weekend!"}
{"text":"Yuuuuuuuuum! Came here with my parents for a quick lunch and boy, was it good! It was 1pm on a weekday and it was understandably not as busy as you would expect from the reviews. I agree it's a very chill environment for a lunch date or just catching up with friends.

In terms of food, we ordered the mushroom pizza to share. The featured pizza was beef bolognese I believe. We didn't try it simply because I'm vegetarian. Will definitely come back to try the 4-maggi pizza and the kale salad that everyone is raving about!"}
{"text":"This review is delayed, but I remember it like it was yesterday...

My boyfriend and I decided to go out for a 4 month anniversary lunch one Saturday afternoon.  When we got inside the doors of Una, I was surprised to see a line up.  I understand a busy dinner rush, but a weekend lunch rush?  This place MUST be good.  Fortunately we didn't have to wait long, and even if we did they let you roam along 17th freely and will call your cell phone when your table is ready.  How awesome is that?

We sat up at the bar and witnessed all the action that took place, the cooks hustling and bustling in their narrow kitchen area, the bartender putting lots of love into his drinks, and the servers diligent and un-phased by the rush of people.  Despite how busy Una was, it certainly didn't reflect in the relaxed and fun ambience that we experienced.

We ordered 2 long island iced teas, that were the best we've had yet, I really appreciate the fact that they don't do fountain pop.  All their pop comes straight out of individual glass bottles, which I think adds a cool little flare of authenticity to the place.  

A decision on their Swiss Chard pizza was a brilliant one.  It had double smoked bacon, wilted swiss chard, goat feta, and provolone piccante.  It was nothing short of delectable, I can still taste the fresh and savouriness of the zza, a melt in your mouth type of experience if you will.

We left Una that afternoon completely satisfied and with the perfect buzz to carry on along 17th."}
{"text":"I'm so happy we stumbled upon this place.  I was visiting from Toronto on the weekend and we were on our way to buy some cupcakes at Crave when we walked past this restaurant.  We had just arrived in Calgary and we were starving.  The place is really cute, and the service was very good, it was a Friday afternoon, so it wasn't to busy.  We had the Persian Dates and the Shrimp Pizza.  We had dinner reservations that evening at Blink, so we didn't want to fill up too much.  We had a few slices left over and took them with us for a next-day-snack.

We enjoyed our lunch so much, that on Sunday before our flight home we visited again.  We had the Mozzarella app and Mushroom Pizza.  Same thing, again we took a few slices home to enjoy on the plane.

I would highly recommend this place for a casual fun meal."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Calgary. Get the Procuitto and Arugula pizza. Be prepared to wait 1+ hours on weekends"}
{"text":"Only after sitting down and getting comfortable to write this review did I realize my Yelp reviews have been pizza-laden, to say the least. To anyone who has an inexplicable interest in my eating habits, yes, I do eat more than just pizza. But tonight, it was UNA, and it was ballin'. Pizza-Ballin', you might say. Not in the sense that there are a bunch of G's pushing stacks at UNA's tables (although Jay-Z did make an appearance in the artwork adorning the east wall), but because I felt like I was in a rap video raining bills when it came time to pay - or at least, my girlfriend certainly did. The best.

Anyways, that was hyperbolic, so let's rewind. The old adage \"you get what you pay for\" held true on this evening. Despite being a little bit more expensive than the average night out, once the food hits your lips, you'll feel the purse strings start to loosen. The Prosciutto pizza we shared was excellent, as were the meatballs and broccoli that preceded it. Washed down with a glass of Sur de los Andes Malbec, and....climax.

The only qualm I had was that it was 30 degrees outside, the AC was seemingly minimal, and chef-side seating bordered on sauna-esque. 4.5 star material, for those in a bad mood. But really, these days happen between 2-6 times a year in Calgary, so complaining about it is in poor taste in my opinion. The other 359-363 days of the year, I'm sure you'll be close to perfectly comfortable. 

I would definitely recommend UNA. Good vibe, great food, interesting selections and preparation. 

Go now! Run there!"}
{"text":"Such a great atmosphere and the food is exquisite. First off - talk about ahead of its time! The no reservations is a breath of fresh air and automated text when a table is available gives you time to enjoy the sights while waiting. Ordered the 4-maggi and was overwhelmingly pleased. The prosciutto pizza comes with too much arugala which hinders from the natural flavours of the pie. Great wine and beer, and always great service. One of, if not the best pizza joint in Calgary. 4.5 star (yelp doesn't allow such finely detailed ratings)"}
{"text":"The food is decent but the wait is absolutely ridiculous.  A friend of ours was really excited about this place and wanted us to try it.  He made the reservations - it was a Saturday evening.  He was told it would be an hour and a half until we could be seated.  They took his cell number and we went to a nearby pub to wait and have a drink.  TWO hours later they phoned back and said they had a table ready for us.  We arrived and were seated promptly We ordered our pizzas, appies and a bottle of wine between the three of us.  Mid way through the pizzas our friend tried to order more wine but they refused to serve him saying he was too drunk.  When he politely disagreed they got nasty.  He's no obnoxious 20 something, he's pushing 60.  I guess it's so busy in there individual customers mean nothing to them.  Go to Without Papers Pizza instead, or even Pizza Bob's.  The food is better, the service is friendly and you won't waste your entire night waiting for a seat."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar which is a great place to sit in his nice quaint 15 table establishment.  The bartenders make drinks and  the salads. I had the best Caprese Salad I have ever had and I eat them a lot! The fresh basil was great and I liked how the cheese was crumbled up instead of being served in a ball..  Second course was the Tagliatelle pasta but asked them to add prosciutto which was amazing.  Great portions.  Ended the meal off with a nicely made Latte.  Great place"}
{"text":"I love UNA. The pizza is delicious and the wine is fantastic. The price is also excellent. Brittany, the server always goes on and beyond for me. She truly appreciates her job, which I appreciate. The atmosphere is great, I truly get excited when my husband takes me to UNA or when I go with a group of my coworkers. The place is just remarkable overall. They even make gluten free pizza! Delish!"}
{"text":"The 4-maggi pizza is literally the best pizza that I have ever had. When I lived in Calgary, my sister seriously wanted me to pick up a pizza and bring it on the plane back to Ottawa for her. People complain the that the wait can be long... It is long for a reason! The food is phenomenal. Definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Yikes.
My boyfriend and I came here late in the evening (11:45pm) for my birthday dinner, and he has a medical condition that makes it so he can only talk very quietly, so we usually ask to sit beside each other, otherwise I can't hear him in a restaurant.
The place only had a couple tables of people in it - almost empty since it was just over an hour before closing, and had more than half a dozen 4-seater tables empty (I think all of them) that would allow us to sit side by side.
On asking to sit beside each other, the waiter says \"no problem\" and then takes us to a 2-seater table where he would have to sit across from me.
We figure he musn't have understood, so we wait for him to come back and explain again, and he tells us no. We'd probably eaten there a dozen times and it was never an issue, and when I explain this, he still insists no.
They offer for us to sit at the bar, but both of us have bad backs also, and it's not particularly comfortable for dinner. I'm confused at why this is a problem in a virtually empty restaurant, and ask to speak to the manager.
Manager comes over and still insists no.
Seriously? What the heck?
I totally understand if they were busy, or anticipating a lot of people, but in a empty room an hour and a half before closing on a Wednesday?
It's the first time, ever, anywhere that a place could easily accommodate his disability and has chosen not to - and we eat out basically every night.
Unreal. Obviously we left. And will not be returning.
If I could give 0 stars, I would."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food and drink are great but it's a little crammed inside, space wise."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Being a big Ox & Angela fan, I had high expectations for Una, as they have the same owners. The perpetual waiting list (they don't take reservations) also contributes to the expectations. Alas, I can only give it three stars for the food, four for the service. We started with the prosciutto wrapped, walnut stuffed dates. Served with flaked salt and a sweet reduced wine drizzle, these bites were a tasty start. 

The main attraction though, the pizza, was just okay. The crust was a bit reticent and dry for my liking. The four cheeses version was decent, after all, it has lots of cheese! Notwithstanding the 4-cheese, the pizza options here don't have a lot of cheese, nor much of any sauce according to their menu descriptions. The weekly special was also lacking. The special consisted of smoked mozzarella, kale, lamb, and an Eastern European eggplant spread. Unfortunately, this combo was pretty bland. The server was kind enough to bring out some honey upon my request (if you haven't tried this, you're missing out). When I got the leftovers home, I added Harissa paste and crumbled goat feta, now that made it a pizza with flavour pop!  

I must say that the service was very good (including the waitress slyly Googling \"amaro\" from behind the bar after I asked for one), and the staff managed to seat us earlier than expected.  The pizza flavours though didn't wow me like I expected based on the popularity of this joint."}
{"text":"While in Calgary we were looking for somewhere to eat pizza, at the same time we wanted to find somewhere local. We found this restaurant on Yelp and thought we would give it a try and we are so glad we did! The service was great, the atmosphere was authentic and the food was amazing!!! You can't go wrong ordering the Mozzarella balls and any of the pizzas, there is so much flavor in all of it. You can't go wrong if you try it here."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Amazing kale salad!!! Amazing service everytime I go! One of my favourites!!!"}
{"text":"Overall UNA Pizza was great but there was a feeling of trying too hard. We ordered the mushroom and margherita pizzas. While the margherita pizza was great and flavor, the mushroom pizza felt over done. The pizza was drenched in truffle oil which we felt should not have been the star flavor."}
{"text":"I am a total fan of the food here. Exquisite flavours prepared to perfection. The hardest part will be getting in. The wait is loooong and I've never been when you can just walk in and get a table. Really, they could double or triple the size of the place and still have a line-up out the door. Inside, tables are cramped and the atmosphere is busy. It's not a place for an intimate meal. But the food makes up for *everything*. As far as pizza goes, it just doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"I am all about the Gluten-Free bandwagon, and my only regret was not knowing that I could get a gluten-free crust. 
Had the Prosciutto Pizza and it made me fall in love with ham all over again. And even though both Una and I are all about the wine, I just had to try the Pink Velvet beer combo. It was okay.
The worst part of the experience is having half my pizza wrapped up to go, all excited to eat the rest for lunch the next day and being startled by the homless man outside as soon as I walked out the door onto 17th. He asked to have my food - and I was kind of sad I handed it over."}
{"text":"Una is impressive, since it doesn't seem that a place like this can exist in Calgary.  Good, unique food with a trendy setting and a great location.  The mushroom pizza is my favourite pizza, with the meatballs as a favourite appetizer.  One pizza, however, is probably too much for the average person, and I always have leftovers.

Also, the last time I went to una, there were four tables with children at the table.  It was slightly unnerving, since I did not expect them, and it is a rather expensive restaurant as well.  Though, they went rather unnoticed, as it is quite loud in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious, but the first time that my friend & I tried to go for supper, we were told it would be an hour and a half wait. So we decided to go another day for lunch instead, and it was great. Short wait time for our food & it was delicious. They are also able to offer gluten-free options for those that require those options. The only thing I found problematic with the place was the decor, and how there was a large geometric painting with black & white pictures of Aboriginal people on the wall... I was kind of curious as to how it 'fit' the place as an Abo person, myself."}
{"text":"UNA has very good pizza, I'll give it that. On the other hand, it is also super busy all the time and people are packed in like sardines in a can. Oh, and there are no reservations and waits are generally 45 minutes or more.

During the summer, the mix of the pizza ovens and the sardine characteristics cause the temperature to reach uncomfortable levels. During the winter, it probably is closer to toasty rather than sauna levels.  

Considering the wait and the restaurant's arrangement, the 4 stars are due to an amazing atmosphere along with some impressive food. UNA is a place which buzzes with activity. You can almost feel the coolness flowing from the food, the decor and the people.

The prosciutto pizza is delicious while the Swiss chard is ok.  The wine added some refinement to the meal but the prices were a little steep with a bottle of house wine between $35 - $40 dollars. The stuff is drinkable but hardly memorable. 

Overall, hanging with the cool kids for an evening is fun but I doubt it will become my regular haunt.

12/30"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place and finally got a chance over the long weekend when they weren't that busy as most people were out of town. Last time I tried coming here it was a 2 hour wait so we decided to go elsewhere. Well, we should have waited last time as it was worth it. 

Doesn't compare to real Italian pizza, but it is the closest thing you will find in Calgary. The ingredients are very fresh, and the pizzas full of unique flavours. You have to try the pizza here - in fact the menu is cutely divided between \"pizza\" and \"not pizza\". 

The décor and clients are quite trendy. Water is $2/person, get the sparkly - it's quite good. Will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"This place is always packed with trendy young people and I heard a lot of good things about it. So we decided to give it a try, especially after our trip to Italy, we are eager to find good pizza in Calgary. However, our pizza came out way too salty and we didn't enjoy it. However, we did drink lots of wine to wash off the salt. My husband joked that they must've intentionally put so much salt so they can sale more wine. LOL.

Anyways, we have experienced much better pizza in town, so unfortunately this one is a no for us. 
As for the good value and good taste pizza that actually like the ones we had in Italy, go down a few blocks and go to Giuseppe's Italian Market in Victoria Park."}
{"text":"We are visiting from Toronto for the Stampede and Una was recommended to us. We had such a great meal! Everything was beyond delicious and our server Lindsey was amazing! Recommended a great wine and was so attentive to us. Will for sure be back when we are in Calgary next."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of thin crust napoletana style pizza, and I have enjoyed the pizzas at UNA on more than one occasion. The atmosphere is a great mix of trendy and casual. The staff are very friendly and they know the menu very well. 

On my most recent visit to UNA, I came with my mom and sister for a Sunday afternoon lunch. My mom forgot her reading glasses and the server was so kind in helping her choose a wine. He even brought a small sample glass before bringing the full glass. I ordered a Caipirinha, which was made with crushed ice and very refreshing. The three of us shared the pesto pizza and the prosciutto pizza. I loved the pesto pizza; the goat feta and zucchini were great together. The prosciutto pizza was good too, but I prefer the prosciutto/arugula version at Pulcinella. Must be because it has more arugula and also has cherry tomatoes. 

Every time I go to UNA, my table mates never want to try any of the bar food items or share plates. One day I will try those meatballs! 

My only complaint about UNA is that it is just so dang busy. I've come a few different evenings at peak dinner hour and the wait was over an hour! I'm happy the restaurant is doing well, but when I get to a restaurant, I'm usually too hungry to wait an hour to be seated. I was pleased to get in right away this past Sunday at lunch, I'll probably stick to lunch time or late night visits to UNA from now on.

Quirky note: They were playing a Harry Potter book on tape in the Ladies  washroom on Sunday afternoon! Made me giggle when I realized what the loud deep voice was reading from."}
{"text":"love UNA, simply good consistent pizzas"}
{"text":"Had the worst service of my life today. Finished eating and we didn't touch the rest of our food for almost 30 minutes before someone noticed us. We sat at the bar and the people beside us knew the girl working behind the counter and it seemed like they had great attentive service. Finally got our food packed up by another staff member who wasn't our server, and we asked for the bill. No one talked to us for another 20 minutes, no bill. Basically just sat there trying to get our servers attention. We were literally sitting right in front of her at the bar and she wouldn't make eye contact with us and didn't seem to hear us when we tried to get her attention. I've been to this restaurant so many times I consider myself a regular, now I don't even want to go back in. Maybe I'll consider takeout as the service has really gone downhill lately."}
{"text":"Ingredients are fresh however the crust isn't the best - shallow flavor profile in my humble opinion.

Will not hesitate to return if I crave a simple slice of thin crust pizza but did not blow me away"}
{"text":"I keep going back because I love the food and atmosphere.  The pizza is great but dont sleep on the rest of the menu.  Especially the meatballs!  And the wine!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to bring friends visiting the city! Great service, great food, great location! The only thing is I can agree its a little on the pricey end of the spectrum for pizza but it is very authentic and unique."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite restaurant in Calgary. The service is outstanding, the food is always wonderful, and I love the trendy atmosphere. I have come here for Valentine's Day, my birthday, and for a graduation night-out as I know I will always have a great meal. The pizza is always perfect and the chili oil you can get with it is to die for. I recommend this restaurant to everyone and I don't know anyone who has been disappointed thus far!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great I love the atmosphere and the staff is very friendly as well you have to try the mushroom pizza ! Why not 5 star ? Every time you go the wait time is ridiculous but the pizza it's worth waiting so maybe is the wait time wasent as long it would be 5 star rating just a reminder if your looking for a spot to eat quickly Una is not the place but the pizza is delicious"}
{"text":"Food is great, and so is the service.  It's too bad then that I left so disappointed over a charge of $10 for four glasses of water and $8 for an after dinner Americano. I felt completely ripped off despite the core menu (pizza and apps) being quite a fair value."}
{"text":"The service here was phenomenal - but sometimes I felt that the server got a little close if not touchy-feely. 

Tried the Maple Bacon Pizza and it tasted like breakfast on pizza dough - essentially the best thing you could have on a warm sunny day. The selection of wine was awesome, and we had great advice for choosing a selection that fit our tastes. 

I think the dessert was a little lacking. The peanut butter type dessert was very sweet although delicious, and we came away with quite a powerful sugar high after. 

This is a very busy place so make sure you are either prepared to wait or come during the off-hours to ensure you get a good spot."}
{"text":"Great food, the kale Caesar salad is my favourite. The service is always good but the wait for a table can be long. The prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a veggie pizza with sun dried tomatoes, honey , mushrooms, friulano and feta cheese which was so flavourful and light. Service was polite and attentive. Had a Trolley No.5 Upbeat wheat beer which awesome with citrus tones. Would come back here."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great wine, great atmosphere - what's not to love!? 

I stumbled into this place a few weeks ago with a friend and quickly found a space at the bar for some drinks and a quick bite. I think we played it pretty safe with some bread to start plus the 4-maggi and mushroom thin crust pizzas, but everything was awesome. Definitely make full use of the honey. Bar staff were friendly and attentive even though the restaurant was busy. Ended the night with an espresso + desert and left with a doggy bag of pizza. (Pro tip: go hungry and try to finish your pizza at the restaurant as it definitely was not a good the next day)

Excited to go back and try some pizza with meat!"}
{"text":"UNA can be described in two words: trendy and delicious. The location, atmosphere and design were very hip, with a slight industrial feel, and yet you don't need to dress up that much. There was a little bit of a wait to get a table, but it was definitely worth it.

 Enough about the design...can we talk about the food?! The sourdough bread was delicious, served with very garlicky butter and salt, and the menu boasted other delectable items. I would have liked a bit more of a selection, but everything sounded so lovely and wonderful, I'm sure I would have had even more of a difficult decision to make had there been more choices. The pizza is quite possibly some of the best pizza I have eaten (and I've been fortunate enough to dine on pizza in Venice), and I loved the the toppings and sauces are not boring (sometimes it's nice to change from the same old Hawaiian). The price was reasonable, and the staff provided good service, and I must say, they were all pretty good looking, which is a nice bonus ;). 

I loved the vibe that UNA gave, and their food was amazing. I will definitely be returning in the future, either on a date or just a get together with my friends."}
{"text":"Possibly my favorite restaurant in the whole world! I absolutely love love love this place. The service is always amazing plus waiters are super cute :) I have never ordered a bad thing from the menu. The meatballs are a favourite and the Tiki pizza is delicious! Try the prosciutto wrapped dates they are also so yummy. 

Usually the wait is long but it is not really an issue because you can give them your cell phone number and I'll call you when you have a table ready. You can't really go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"Love it! Super yummy pizzas. Try the clams, the flavors are amazing!"}
{"text":"I first tried UNA shortly after it opened, and fell in love with their Swiss Chard pizza. That is no longer on the menu (sad face), but I am still a fan. So many pizza joints are opening up, but I still find myself preferring UNA over all those places. I looooove the decor and atmosphere. The staff are quite hipster-ish, but I've never had bad service. My current favorites there are the Prosciutto and Mushroom pizzas. I've also had the Peanut Butter and Chocolate Terrine for dessert, and it was amazing. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because I really want them to bring back the Swiss Chard. It was my all time favorite there!"}
{"text":"Great vibe, great food and good service. It's about time Calgary got quality eatery that is open late night!"}
{"text":"I had the divine-ing (divine + dining) pleasure of gorging into the delectable, savory, vegetarian pizza, while sipping on a white, apple, wine libation, with some incredible #WATA ladies last night. 

We had a great time, and I was definitely intrigued with the playing of the audio book \"Harry Potter\" in the ladies washroom. 

I've never mixed pizza + wine before. I'm used to pizza + beer. However, the latter is usually far more grease-afied, and leaves the infamous sludgey after feeling, while the pizza + wine mix, was reminiscent of my travels in Europe where I observed that one actually takes the time to enjoy a meal which enhances the quality of conversation. And good conversation always equals good times."}
{"text":"Not sure what the fuss is about?  Had lunch here with a friend, ordered the meatball appetizer and the Pear pizza.  Meatballs came in a watery, flavor uninspired sauce and were boringly spiced with garlic, pepper and my guess was cayenne. The meatballs from Double Zero put these to shame. Pizza was simple and blah, not a lot going on with the walnut, pear and onion toppings of which the pear was not ripe. My friend had a glass of wine and the total bill was $45. In my opinion, you can have 10 times the quality and taste down the street at Borgo for a similar price. 

Strangely our appetizers arrived at the same time as our pizza and the table for two couldn't handle both plates. Another observation, if you are serving pizza on a platter, make sure it is sliced all the way through as we were left to hack at it with a butter knife to just get a slice on our plates 

Interior is small and intimate but you'll have a hard time speaking because they have crappy oldies piping through the speakers. Comparatively speaking, this place is at the bottom of my list for new wave Calgary pizza offerings. Check out Pulcinella, Double Zero or WO Papers in that order before giving these guys your money."}
{"text":"Feeling hungrier than Bam Bam Bigelow myself and some mates hopped on our fixies and we lurked hard like our name was Rick Ross . We ended up at UNA and I must say we were quite delighted. In a city , where meat and more meat is the norm for pizza this is a pleasant change. The last time I had a potato pizza I was in Brooklyn , and I must say the UNA experience was not only comparable , but  exceed my Brooklyn experience. The idea of potato on a pizza might sound unsettling ,  like a Van Morrison-Geto Boys mix , yet the juxtaposition of two things that inherently should not mix --creates something very beautiful."}
{"text":"We have been to Una a few times with friends and have found a reason to return each time. The overall experience has been good. Most of the pizza we have tried is either average or good (simple and flavorful) and they have good starters. Quick and efficient service, good wine list (I just hope they could serve all of by glass/carafe). I hope the wine was a bit cheaper too."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure being served at Calgary's very own UNA.
The wine pairings are absolutely amazing.
My personal favourite is tje cheese cake after my meal.
Great servers and chefs.

Thank you guys"}
{"text":"This is by far my fav spot on 17th ave.  I have always had amazing food and service there.  The kale caesar salad is to die for and the prawns are delicious! SO YUMMY!"}
{"text":"We went to UNA after going to see Mary Poppins at the Jube. It was about 11pm at night, so it wasn't very busy. We ordered the Meatballs as an apply and they were PHENOMENAL! They weren't over cooked or undercooked. Perfectly seasoned and everything. The we ordered the mushroom pizza. It came quickly after the meatballs so we didn't have to wait long. The mushroom pizza was very very good swell, the only reason i didn't give the last star is because we felt that there needed to be more seasoning on the mushrooms or pizza itself. There was also a little too much truffle oil on the pizza.. a couple drops is good, but even a heavy drizzle can take away from the simpleness of the dish.  Will be back for sure though to try more pizzas!"}
{"text":"Been to UNA a good amount over the past few year, always a good atmosphere and the food is consistently great!  Great time to go on the summer when on a stroll on 17th ave!"}
{"text":"This place deserves a short but sweet review. The service was low key, quick, and friendly. I liked that the non-pretentious but respectful attitude matched the interior and vibe of the restaurant. I shared 4 different pizzas with the table - you can't go wrong, they were all delicious. Service was quick. They have a great little patio in the summer if you're looking to people watch. Drink menu is great, and they serve an assortment of Wild Rose brews. 

I'd recommend this for smaller groups, first and second date, and catching up with a friend."}
{"text":"Food is great I love truffle oil.  Usually packed so make a reservation or have a back up plan.  Love their olive appetizer.  Obey the waiting que or get yelled at.  The rest of the staff were fantastic.  Good fit for a first date and wine prices are right."}
{"text":"I'll keep this one short and sweet.  Best fucking pizza in the city. Period. (mic drop)"}
{"text":"If you like overpriced, pretentious service, this is the place for you! Pizzas taste ok, but if you're thinking of eating in the restaurant you can expect to be crammed in with another 80 people in a tiny space, shoulder to shoulder."}
{"text":"A welcome addition to 17th Ave SW.  Una is a family favourite. The staff were super accommodating with our toddler.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I love the gluten-free pizza here. The service is great, and the options are very clear and amazing for gluten-free people. I came here two nights in a row because it was so good! I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great pizza here! Nice crust and toppings. Only negitive comment would be the tables are tiny!"}
{"text":"The Kale Caesar salad is fantastic. Definitely a busy spot if you're there for a weekend lunch, I  would recommend going on a weekday for a more relaxed vibe. The service is always very friendly -- even when they're serving a full-house. I'm really excited for the take away spot opening later this year."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great beer, incredible staff. It`s a great place to chill out on a date, or just have a pint while you wait for take-away pizza."}
{"text":"A friend brought me here a while ago I was visiting Calgary, and the deliciousness is still imprinted in my mind. 
We started with little bites of boccaccini, anchovy and pimento. They were good, but the best was yet to come.  The seared scallops with prosciutto and olive tapenade were absolutely OUT OF THIS WORLD!  They were perfectly cooked, and the crisped prosciutto gave a really nice texture contrast.  We also had the sambuca shrimp, which were so good we tried to re-create them the next night. 
The mushroom and arugula pizza had a nice earthy-ness , though I'd gladly make a meal of all the little appetizers. 
And... we had a great view of the kitchen action, sitting at the bar. It was like watching artists at work... and then devouring their masterpieces :)"}
{"text":"If you're lucky like we were and managed to get in right before the dinner rush, then you are on your way to a world of deliciousness. This venue isn't too big so if your dining party is greater than two and you come right at dinner get ready to wait . . .and wait . . . and wait (they don't take reservations and it's first come first serve depending on the size of your party)

As I mentioned, it's quite small so you're about arm's length away from the next table - the upside to this is that you get to see all the food everyone else is ordering :)

We started with the seared scallops, and settled on two pizzas: 4-maggi with prosciutto and salami pizza. Scallops were AH-mazing! I'm a big fan of their 4-maggi, I think it's because I love pizza that aren't tomato sauce based. This one is a wonderful melody of 4 cheeses and a honey truffle oil (and the added prosciutto gives it a nice saltiness to contract the honey). The salami pizza was really good too, it has thin salami shavings as opposed to thick chunks (that you get normally at other pizza chains)

Even though it was busy, we never felt rushed to leave (It irks me how some places will drop off the bill right after you're done eating and say \"no rush, whenever you're ready :D\" . . . ok clearly you want me to leave since I didn't ask for the bill and may possibly have wanted dessert)

The quality of food and service is fantastic here, it may seem a bit pricey to eat here but it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I never, never, NEVER have a bad experience with UNA. Dine-in or take out, they are always super friendly, professional, and the food is made perfectly every time. I love the rotation of specials as well, and when you're sitting down for meal you're guaranteed to have a great waiter who is keen to keep you satisfied. 

For anyone who is looking to try it for the first time, the Beltline is great for meat lovers, and the maple syrup just perfects it. It's a close contender to their famous 4maggi!! And for anyone looking for something other than pizza, they have a fantastic kale Caesar salad topped with prosciutto and a hard boiled egg that is to die for. 

UNA, I love you. You're solid as a rock, never change.

Edit ** about the no reservations thing, I've never had too many issues with grabbing a table walking right in but I do tend to go late? And if there's a wait it's quite fast. There's also plenty of places to waste time next door as well!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 5/5
Service: 4/5
Food: 4/5
Overall experience: 4/5

Went there on the weekend and the place was packed.  My date and I ate at the bar and had an excellent time.  The atmosphere was friendly, music was trendy and the food was good quality.

If you want a surprise...order a diet coke...I dare you!"}
{"text":"Love the food here, it is some of the best pizza I have ever eaten. The service was lacking last time I visited though and I found them to be a little condescending. They refused to split up our bill and wanted us to add the tax ourselves"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. Went here for anniversary. Had Prosciutto pizza, kale ceasar salad and chicken pate appetizer. Portions are very generous, hubby and I shared everything and we had food left over. The wine is also very good, had the zinfendel. That pate tho!! Seriously delicious combo of chicken pate with sweet decadent figs and mustard with a side of warm buttered bread- pair with a red wine- unbelievable burst of flavor. Their desert was a bit of a dud though (hazelnus chocolate cake)- a bit dry but the rest of the meal made up for it!!"}
{"text":"The pizza at UNA is fantastic! The crust is the best in Calgary in my opinion. They use great ingredients and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The kale salad is a top pick of mine. It's always fresh and flavourful! If you like kale you'll be hooked. The venue is small but I take advantage of the hassle free take out service they offer. UNA is a mainstay on 17th Ave SW."}
{"text":"Jan25/17 was probably our worst visit since Una opened! The waitress sucked and dressed sleazy. I thought Una was an upscale Pizza Joint? T'Was their 'birthday days' with discounts which was unexpected but saw the staff drinking wine at the bar and they definitely ignored us and were more interested in Socializing together! Unprofessional in my mind.Service sucked big time! Waitress missed ordering one of our appetizers meant to occupy our little person at the table and frankly the mushroom pizza had far too many mushrooms!... like a blanket- Yuk! Our birthday dinner for my daughter sucked!Hope you make your next Birthday-- I won't be going back"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the pizza and the appetizers that my family and I had ordered were doused in salt to the point where we could not even eat it. Friendly staff and atmosphere except the salt has to stop."}
{"text":"Of course, I was back at UNA; and of course, it was delicious.

But here's the best part ... I learned a little something special about UNA this last visit, (psst, don't tell a bunch of people okay? This'll be our secret) Josh at the bar is an exceptional cocktail mixer. (Does that make him a \"cocktailer\"?)

Get him to mix you a nicely balanced Classic, an excellent Manhattan or a proper Pims and I promise you will not be disappointed.

He loves what he mixes and mixes what he loves and boy oh boy does it show. Good work Josh, you're about to be a busy man.

T."}
{"text":"Love love love!

I won't say much - there is already a plethora of reviews for this place, which just speaks to how much Calgarians are down with artisan pizza joints.

We started out with an olive appetizer and kale salad. The kale salad stole the show! Both my date and I were absolutely in love with this salad - and it's huge. Even sharing it we couldn't finish it. But, the flavour has stayed with me - I find myself craving it and must go back to hit it up again!

We had a bacon pizza, it was good - maybe a bit on the salty side for my taste. I would have preferred a veggie pizza but I'll have to go back for that.

One thing I will add - we were there around 4 on a weekday. Didn't even think and parked on the street out front, there were lots of cars there. Anyways, our pizza had just come out, we were scarfing it down and enjoying our wine. I looked up and saw my car going around the corner on a tow truck! Wah woh! Luckily, my date - a total gentleman - ran out there and got it back for me. The wait staff in UNA mentioned that this happens all the time - apparently the parking rules on 17th are strictly enforced. I might know this if I spent more time on 17th? ...and there were two other tables who had the same problem. So take heed and pay attention to where you are parking!"}
{"text":"The pizza is really great. If you get an appetizer, definitely enough to share between a couple people. It was packed, but food didn't take long at all."}
{"text":"There's something about UNA...

I don't think I could have an unpleasant time here if I tried. Always buzzing and everyone is happy. I appreciate the seasonally updated wall murals and adore all the servers. 

Their tomato sauce is beautiful, chilli oil is addicting, pizza and features are always everything I am craving and UNA hours rock my world."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with the dine in pizza choices! As for their little take away joint, the pizza sucked & looked like it had been sitting out there all day! The crust was different too (yuk)! But I still love my UNA!"}
{"text":"I'll make this review quick, because I'm mostly echoing what other people have said.

We arrived on a Thursday night at about 5:15.  We tried to go a bit early, since Una doesn't take reso's, and we wanted to have a quick meal.  It's a good thing we showed up when we did, because the place was full (other than a couple of individual seats at the bar) by 5:30.

Their pizza toppings are very full of flavor and are served on a thin crunchy crust.  We had a Prosciutto pizza which comes topped with fresh arugula - the prosciutto was thinly sliced and tasty, though slightly on the salty side. The arugula brings a freshness to the pizza as well as a nice balance to the prosciutto.  We also had the Swiss Chard pizza, which is topped with a healthy dose of bacon (maybe healthy isn't quite the right word here... :-).  This one packs a bacon-y punch and is quite a bit heavier than the Prosciutto pizza.  If you are a bacon lover though, it is a good pick.

The service was friendly and prompt!  I'd like to return to try some of the other types of pizza, as well as some of the non-pizza options."}
{"text":"I'm pretty fuzzy with my pizza as well as my food. I really like the pizza here simply because they have real european crust rather than the other thick crust I'm used to in North America 

There wine list is pretty damm good as well"}
{"text":"Always a good choice. Relaxed atmosphere & yummy food. The kale caesar salad is amazing."}
{"text":"Yes - it is that good.  And totally worth any wait.

Our group shared some salads (the ceasar with kale was amazeballs) and a few pizzas.  The tiki and verde stuck out for me as the kale (I am on a total kale kick) on the verde was crispy and the pork on the tiki was juicy and salty and addictive.  Also loved the shaved pineapple...thin and covered the pizza perfectly.

We sat up at the bar and had excellent service.  My new fav in Calgary."}
{"text":"It's hard to get in here but when you do, the food is worth the wait. It's redundant of me to sing the praises of Una because I've never actually heard anyone say anything bad about the place except that it's too small. Even though you're going to have to wait for your table, you can put your name down then go have a drink nearby (National? Ship?) and they'll call you when your table is ready. Food is incredible, and they have a great wine selection."}
{"text":"This little pizza place is a great place out for casual lunches or dinners. For a table of 5, our party waited for 45 minutes on a Sunday evening. The restaurant is small, yet cozy and the good is phenomenal! This is where the stars start to get taken off; I took off one star for the hefty price tag for the food and .5 star was taken for the location (absurdly hard to find parking); a deduction for another .5 star for the red haired hostess girl at the front for being quite rude; another subtraction of .25 stars for the service (as it was slow); and finally the other .25 for no option to make reservations. 

Overall, I would recommend this place, you should try it at least once- my personal favourite is the veggie pizza here, it is to die for, the intricate flavours just tie the pizza together. 

Tips: 
1) I would not bring babies here as it is small and if the kids are young and cranky, that may ruin the experience for others. Please be weary. 

2) I would be prepared to wait especially if you have large parties, there's this nifty little app that lets you know where you are in line and how long is the wait time. Even for small groups, if you are going during peak hours, expect to wait. 

3) Make sure you leave plenty of time for parking."}
{"text":"I have been to Una a few times already. I went a couple weeks ago after 9 PM, got a seat right away at the bar. I ordered a walnut stuffed persian date - it was divine! Next I ordered the mushroom pizza - I always order this one! The next time I want to try their dessert!"}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I have been to Una. I was craving their Ceasar salad today. Despite the fact that one could eat here fairly economically - there are a lot of temptations! The pizzas are good but what haunts me is their Kale Ceasar salad. If you are not normally a salad person then this will change your mind - ? It is big and easily a meal in itself - pure magic -  the right amount of tang in the dressing, prosciutto, panko crumbs, cheese and a beautiful egg (not too hard); a beautiful balance of texture a flavour. But... Oh! How can one not order their wings? Their wings are not wings, they are thighs and so delicious!!! The flavour, the spice, the tang,  the cheese dip - wow! There are lots of great temptations are Una, but these are my faves. I am long over due for a visit. They are too busy during peak times so go off peak times and avoid the long wait."}
{"text":"The food was incredible and the restaurant itself is really cute. That being said, my friend and I ended up feeling uncomfortable and upset with the service. We had ordered single caesers to drink, knowing that caesers are a staple drink and are often fairly priced, however we were surprised when we were charged $11, which is a pretty steep price. We politely inquired about whether or not they had accidentally charged us for doubles, which we would have been okay with, but the waitress and who I am assuming to be the manager(?)
responded aggressively and continued to talk about us within earshot and were obviously complaining about our question to each other. To make things worse- the manager (?) had been drinking during her shift. This isn't our first time here, and we come because we like this place, but the staffs unprofessionalism left us feeling disappointed with the experience."}
{"text":"What pizza place is known for their kale salad?!?!?  This place!  Which was our appetizer before our pizza and meatballs arrived.  Which was a great idea for me to prevent me from over eating on the pizza.

The kale salad was a huge portion to share, it was only us two and we finished it.  At first I was like whoa the vinaigrette was a lot or strong, but after a while I was like mmm I want more. And we end up finish it.  Not many places offer kale salad so for it to be an option it was good.

Unfortunately, the meatballs were large but dry in my opinion.  I drenched it in the tomato sauce and finished it but maybe it would have been better on the salad?  I dunno, but I wouldn't order it again.  

The mushroom pizza was okay.  A lot of mushrooms, good!  A lot of cheese, too much.  Next time I will try 
Another flavor someone posted on here.  I think it was the California pizza, with and egg in the middle?  that looked good...

Seating is quite cramped during the winter if you have to share your space w your stuff and jackets.  Half the restaurant is bar/counter like seating.  The first half of chairs have back to lean on or out your jacket on.  Second half in the back are stools so u have to put your stuff on hooks.  Thank god we end up getting a seating at a table which is almost like seating in New York, next to your neighbor.  And if you have a bit of a booty, good luck getting into the bench wall side.  

Gets hot near the kitchen, get ready to get warm during dinner too.

Service was great to hostess to wait staff. So kudos to the staff.  They were nice, helpful and great attitude.  Their bosses are lucky to have them."}
{"text":"Visiting from California. Found on Yelp. Mushroom pizza very good. Butter lettuce salad fearful. Nice wine selection. Loud atmosphere. Service just ok. Took long time for pizza to be ready. Good food, poor service."}
{"text":"Well my first time at UNA certainly didn't disappoint. I had been putting off visiting because I had heard such positive things about UNA,... yes it's strange but the more great things I hear about a restaurant the higher my expectations and the greater the possibility to disappoint. Remember Platoon?

UNA was all that it was cracked up to be. A wonderful setting, nicely laid-out dinning area with several small tables, a few larger ones, and a good sized bar area. We were seated quickly, the staff was attentive, and despite the busy lunch hour we felt well looked-after.

Onto the food! If you're at UNA it's for the the pizza. And if you want a good test for a proper pizza napoletana, pick up a slice and hold it out in front of you. The crust should not flop, bend or otherwise sag. Now bite, it should be crisp on the bottom, lightly sauced, and not weighed down with excessive toppings and cheese. 

Bottom line, UNA has the best pizza napoletana that I have tried outside of Italy. Do yourself a favour and get there early for lunch on a sunny day."}
{"text":"I hit this place and the take-out spot twice a week. Tops food and wine list and my favorite staff in the city - ask Stephen for an Old Fashioned, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Well placed little pizza joint. This isn't your usual pizza. Thin crust, well chosen ingredients, little cheese. If you're looking for low chol/healthy pizza, and a very decent ambiance with wine/beer - this is a winner. Great date venue."}

and last but CERTAINLY not least, the BEST gluten-free pizza crust i have ever had. in fact, better than i ever dreamed it could be."}
{"text":"My favourite pizza joint in Calgary. 

What makes this place amazing is a combination of their consistent tasting, unique pizzas and the crowd. I'm not usually a fan of busy places, but walking into a restaurant full of people having a sweet time adds to this dining experience.

Couples/pairs beware. This restaurant is very popular with couples/pairs on any given night. I went on a Monday at 7pm. As usual, the joint was packed. I went up to the hostess to ask if I had any hope of getting a table for 5. To my pleasant surprise, having a larger party was an advantage. Go figure.

Get their Beltline Pizza. A true Canadian twist: double smoked bacon and maple syrup. Your mouth's watering."}
{"text":"This pizza was incredible, not the best pizza I've ever had because I've had pizza in Italy, but it was very very good, my favorite was the one with prosciutto and Arugula. It's their best seller.In fact so much arugula it shows up it looks like a salad pizza. But with beautiful very expensive aged Parmesan melted on top.  We also had roasted cauliflower which was delicious and creamy with dates which addedadded to the sweetness, and also the four meat pizza which was great but a little salty. But my sons loved it . The staff are great despite the crowd, even though it's only Thursday the place was totally buzzing and crowded and lovely. The tables were a bit too close together for me but it was worth it for the great food and service. Great high ceilings. The photos on the bathrooms kill me, they are hilarious I will include them in this review. If you have good taste and you watch Saturday Night or Brooklyn 99 or love Andy Samberg you will get the joke. Also if you use the bathroom you will laugh, while you're sitting on the toilet instead of listening to boring music you will hear the Harry Potter audiobook read by a distinguished English actor he sounded like John Cleese, it was hilarious. Huge compliments ---thanks to the staff."}
{"text":"Plain and simple this place is awesome. Pizza is so good it will leave you weaping for more. Service.....A++. General vibe...ultra cool. Ate and drank too much but was a great evening."}
{"text":"I wish this place were here in Vancouver cause I would come here often. Actually, maybe it's best that it isn't here. . This was delicious thin crust pizzas in a funky little restaurant. All three pizzas I shared with my friends were awesomely delicious. I've heard about this place for a little while now, and finally got a chance to taste it for myself, and I can say, don't put this place off for too long. It's that good."}
{"text":"UNA'S pizza was really good!! The service was great and the beer was very good. Only problem was the prices kinda pricey,  but typical for the area. Will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"The food is great but every time I've been the service is so slow... I'm going to try again because I really want to love this place."}
{"text":"I could have sworn I reviewed UNA, but....I guess not! I remember the day we decided to come here was a snow day and it was literally the only day that didn't have a wait list at the time!

Upon arrival it was still quite busy inside, I think there was only 2-3 tables open, but we got sat right away.

I ordered a glass of wine and eyed up the choices. We went with stuffed dates to start and the prosciutto pizza. I remember thinking the dates were ok... better at Ox and Angela. The pizza... it was good, but I didn't think it was anything to rave about.

I like the space, I think it's cute inside but I think UNA's popularity is more word of mouth then the actual food itself."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in the city! My favorite pizza hands down is the 4-maggi. Topped with truffle oil and honey, that little sweetness adds so much to a pizza that is pretty simple. Always ask for some chili oil to add to your pizza, it gives it a great little kick! The pizza crust is so light that you can consume 3-4 pieces and not feel too indulgent. And most recently I've come to really love Una's version of chicken \"wings\", boneless chicken thighs flavored with spicy harissa, lime and herbs served with a feta dip. Service is always fast and efficient. The atmosphere is fun and hip and is one of the things I like best about eating there. Because it's so lively it makes me feel like I am in a bigger metropolis like New York city. Follow them on twitter as they are usually good a updating wait times on busy nights, which is basically every night! But trust me, it's worth the wait =)"}
{"text":"We have been to Una twice in the last month, and I will say the Tiki Pizza is to die for.  It's busy, and it's small, I love the sparkling water on tap.  We had a fabulous wine the last time we were there I can't remember to save my life but it was amazing.
I highly recommend this place for pizza in Calgary - I can't decide if this is my favorite or Puccinella, just depends on the day!"}
{"text":"Service wasn't great, drinks are over priced and they forgot to bring us the kale Caesar salad we ordered but the pizza was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"We were impressed from the good pizza and wanted to come again. We tried it three more times but as they do not accept reservations we had no luck to get in anymore. Wait times were usually 1h or more.

What a bummer..."}
{"text":"UNA makes my top 3 for pizza in Calgary. Great service, unique and delicious pizza plus a solid wine selection. The space is modern and hip, cozy yet comfortable. 
UNA is always busy- go early if you want a table or be prepared to wait at least 45 minutes on a Wednesday-Saturday night."}
{"text":"My impression is the cook need to stop talking at the bar and pay attention to making the food. Ordered a Bacon and Pineapple pizza it had SOME bacon on SOME pieces other slices had NONE. If the cost of bacon is to high for you to a the correct amount on a pizza take it off the menu!"}
{"text":"We went early, as we know this place fills up fast. Were given a nice spot by the window, and were attended to right away by our super friendly server. I was a little disappointed they were out of their \"Beltline\" pizza, as that's the one I wanted to try, but the Mushroom pizza I went with was great. Crimini mushrooms, arugula, fresh parm, truffle oil, fantastic. My friend went with the Tiki, which had prociutto, pineapple, and what looked like a jalapeño relish. Also tasty. Our sever never let our drinks get lower than half, and talked us into a peanut butter and chocolate terrine. Peanut butter and chocolate together can do no wrong, ever, so that was also a hit. Overall, we had a great dinner, and will be back to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"A friend was visiting from Montreal, and her flight got here at 9:30pm. Naturally she'd be hungry when she got off the plane, so I wanted to go hit up a restaurant that was open late. And not just any restaurant - I wanted her first impression of Calgary to be HOT. 

Decided to try Una Pizza because from what I'd heard, it served all purposes: it was open late, it had good food, and it was buzzing!

So we showed up last night around 10pm. (I had checked on Twitter already and apparently there was no wait.) The place was packed! I had never seen any restaurant in Calgary so packed so late on a Wednesday night. We were greeted in a few minutes and led through the extremely busy restaurant towards the back. There were 3 spots free infront of the chef's cooking area so we got seated immediately. My friend and I are both foodies so we thought that seat might be the best in the house since we would get to see the chefs do their magic.

After much deliberation (everything on the menu looked great!), we decided to have 3 pintxos, 2 share plates, 1 pizza and a bottle of wine. The pintxos were little bite sized bits of deliciousness made of red pepper, boccocini-type cheese and white anchovies. Very different from anything I've tasted before and very good! We then dove into our share plate of sauteed prawn with red chilli and sambuca. It was So. GOOD. We all agreed that this was absolutely delicious. We even soaked up all the sauce with our bread. Then we tried the scallops plate, and that was good too. Our pizza - a mushroom, cheese and arugula pizza was also delicious! 

One thing that was really remarkable was the service. The food was coming really fast, and we could see it being made right infront of our eyes. And the waitress kept refilling our wine glasses. The chefs were relaxed, kept joking with each other and talked to us about the desserts, and just random stuff. It was a really fun place, and a fun night.

I was really pleased with our dinner, and my friend from Montreal kept saying we picked a great place to come for dinner. I will defintiely be back!"}
{"text":"It is my first time in Calgary, and I wasn't sure what to expect, but the food selection has been great! Una was a great choice for several reasons: interesting menu with a delicious array of small plates, mains, and pizzas. To add to it each item had a really interesting selection/combination of ingredients, for example my starter was the grilled asparagus with orange, a fried egg, drizzled with chopped almonds and oil. I had the 4 cheese pizza, which was unbelievable. There was a truffle honey that you tasted each time you started your next slice that melded divinely with the cheeses. Pizza heaven. 

After taking a time out to digest I had dessert, most of the choices were a bit rich after the pizza so I opted for the vanilla gelato with espresso. Damn. Freshly brewed espresso from intelligensia coffee, poured over the perfectly flavoured vanilla bean gelato. 

The atmosphere was really fun but intimate. Friendly and knowledgable staff added to the atmosphere too. Overall, a delicious spot for pizza and drinks definitely stop by."}
{"text":"Pizza is good, location is good, service is good. The space is a bit reduced and loud. Good for an informal night out with a couple friends"}
{"text":"3.5/5, mainly because I've had better gourmet pizza for very similar prices. Having said that though, the atmosphere was very lively in this modern restaurant. Service was pretty fast, but keep in mind that it takes a while for the pizza to bake so don't come in starved (as we did)! Also, they DONT TAKE reservations and we had a wait time estimate of 1.5 hours on arrival at 7pm on a weekday. So, we opted for the counter seats which have pretty fast turnover. 
I had the prosciutto ($20) pizza, which came topped in deliciousssss arugula :D. The sauce was a little bland for me and I'm not a huge fan of super thin crust. But if you adore thin crust pizza, by all means this is the place to go. The portion was a decent amount and you could probably walk away with a 2-3 slices leftover (for lunch the next day :D) which was a bonus haha. 
Overall, I didn't find anything special about the restaurant as a visitor to Calgary, but the food was certainly decent."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, I just went here for the first time a couple days ago. The hype is real. They are always busy for a reason. They are seriously slaying it everyday. The pizza is bomb ass with that tangy San marzano tomato sauce. So simple and so incredibly delicious. Kale Caesar was also exquisite with a nice light dressing and fluffy generous portion of fresh kale. Lovely. I also recommend the bread and eggplant garlic spread. Stay awesome."}
{"text":"I can't belive this is my first review in months, maybe a year. 
I never would have heard of this place if it wasn't for every other person I know recommending it to me. Pizza and wine seems like a simple concept, and it is. This place is terribly easy to miss, and all 3 of my peeps became disorientated trying to find it. It's very tight, make sure you sit against the wall, or you'll be  constantly moving your seat forward for people to hit up the bathroom. Speaking of the bathroom, there was poetry readings serenading me while I urinated... that's a plus? :) We had a complication with our order, but they were more than gracious to comp it. Pizza was nothing I haven't had before, and I never believe in paying ludicrous marked up prices for wine at restaurants. 
Having said all this... I bought a pizza lastnight, and let me tell you I saved a lot of money AND couldn't believe it wasn't delivery. thanks delissio"}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere, good food. 

I was amazed by the 4-maggi pizza. It's packed with more flavour than you would expect, including hints of pepper and honey (I think). Deceivingly delicious!"}
{"text":"Oh, UNA. I'd heard so many delicious things about you, but I took one look at your menu online and thought, \"well what can a vegan like me eat at UNA? Same cheeseless pizza I could get anywhere else.\"

Nope. Not like \"anywhere else.\" UNA creates magic out of simple ingredients, and transforms them in to a vehicle of deliciousness headed straight for your belly. Does it taste better, because we had been driving around for a bit and every kitchen down 17th was closed at 11, except for UNA's? Perhaps. 

The true test is busting open your boxed up leftover Margharita (and if I hadn't been with company last night, I would've happily shoved the entire pizza in to my face while watching Doctor Who reruns on my phone) and finding that it tastes even better the next day. What is this sorcery? UNA. 

Our server last night was attentive (adorable!), friendly and full of smiles and genuine interest as to what brought us to UNA at midnight. Everyone behind the counter was equally nice, right down to the lady who picked up my friend's phone as it clattered loudly on to the floor, and inspected it for n00ds right before handing it back. 

Must come back and try their Mushroom pizza and the warm Olives appetizer. Must come back for wine. Must come back for smiles and good times. Must come back..."}
{"text":"We had one night in our trip where we had no plans and could choose any place in town. Between location and what we were in the mood for, this place won out. 

What was a bit of a surprise was the atmosphere. Cramped and loud. With an infant it wasn't ideal but even without her it was a struggle to hear my wife. Luckily they had outdoor seating which was a million times better despite the road construction. 

In terms of food, I'm not a fan of Caesar salads but this one was one for the ages. Kale was the perfect leaf and the whole thing was the bomb.  Additionally we had the honey ricotta. Another absolutely fantastic dish. Our entree was the 4 meat pizza. It was good but wasn't mind blowing like the other two. We agreed next time we'd skip the pizza and go with the apps!"}
{"text":"I really like their pizza. It is quite 'light' of a pizza though, definitely not the traditional American heavy cheese-laden pizza."}
{"text":"Always very busy, which is understandable  because UNA is amazing. I constantly crave the 4-maggi. The staff is wonderful, I have never gotten a meal that I didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"This Place has great energy and the concept is awesome. With Friends..or a great place to go for a date after an event. Energy is good. Similar to a restaurant theme in Arizona. The pizza and toppings are both great calibre, and the staff is  on. There maybe waits, but you can always go on a list, and they will call you when somethings available."}
{"text":"It's just OK. Average pizza $20 could feed two girls. The menu is limited in my opinion."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype. Una is overpriced and underwhelming. Far from the best pizza in town, no matter what Kelly tries to tell you."}
{"text":"First time at Una's and we were all WOW! 
The appetizer that I think everyone should try is the walnut wrapped date with prosciutto drizzled with balsamic vinegar. The most amazing appetizer you have ever had! The flavours all all there, salty, sweet, sour. I suggest you get two because one will NOT be enough!
We had the Margarita (I have had better Margarita pizza in Calgary) and the Ukrainian Special. The way that they layered the sour cream, fingerling potatoes, double smoked bacon, provolone cheese and leeks on this one was a hit!
We thought we didn't have room for dessert but our son wanted to try the cheescake and we are so glad we did. Dessert in a jar? Who knew it could be so delicious! Creamy texture, no bake and great graham crust. Every day is a special topping and we got strawberry. 
You've got to try this place! Go early, like 4:00 on a weekday. No lines, no waiting. Same menu. GREAT service!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go to grab a glass of wine and enjoy some high quality food.The restaurant itself is a little small, but they are efficient with bringing out main dishes right after first courses and cleaning tables once someone leaves. The atmosphere overall is a little loud, but the wait staff is extremely friendly and makes sure to provide a pleasant experience.

As far as food goes, there are a lot of options. UNA handles dietary restrictions very well. As a vegan, it can feel troublesome to request modifications; however, our waitress was very willing to accommodate and was communicative with the kitchen about my order. We started with the broccolini as an appetizer (without cheese). For my main, I ordered the veggie pizza with gluten free crust (their regular crust contains honey) and without the roasted red pepper purée (it contains butter). Our waitress didn't initially know that the roasted red peppers contained butter and the kitchen made a pizza with it on; however, once they recognized I wanted a vegan pizza, they were quick to communicate with my waitress and start on an entirely new pizza without my asking. That level of service is not something you see very often and I would highly recommend UNA to any locals or visitors of Calgary.

Overall, it's a great place to grab a bite to eat with your friends. The section of 17th Ave that it sits on is full of cute little shops and restaurants."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place so I came for their pizza. Started with their plate of the day - braised beef and white bean cassoulet. Didn't think that was great - a bit dry and \"boring.\" Not a lot of braised beef. Had their Beltline pizza and Mushroom pizza. They were both good - crispy crust that did not get soggy. However, crust was thick and big...ingredients could've stretched out to the edges more. I thought Cibo (a few streets down) had a better mushroom pizza with a light creamy sauce. The pizza here was not very saucy. Beltline pizza: the maple syrup was the highlight. Loved the smell of it and loved the hint of sweetness. Their old fashioned bourbon was really nice."}
{"text":"Grand re-opening day after the flooding. We had not been here before!
Overall, we enjoyed it!
5pm, the restaurant opened. Everyone quickly filed in ( first come first served, no resos taken here)! 
There are only 2 seats outside so of course they went first but we enjoyed the interior as well. We got a booth seat.
Service was great, attentive.
We wanted to try the meatball appy but that was apparently the one thing that could not be prepped today so we went with the prawn appy with sambuca sauce. Fresh shrimp, very yummy and the sauce - so creative! 
There was a good selection of starters and salads. The salads that came out looked amazing! 
We also ordered a Margarita pizza that was recommended. 
Also very good and if you ask, they will bring out a bit of shredded cheese and chili oil that is out of this world. It came with whole chilis to compliment it. (no charge for these little items which was nice) 
I also liked to have my choice of water that was offered so there is not a water charge slapped on the bill as is the trend at other downtown places. (tap, sparkling or still)
The pizza had a really nice thin crust - the soggy center seems to be the norm these days at Italian eateries? Not a pizza to take home as it would be a gooey mess but great for sharing and devouring there. (I recommend for 2 people, sharing 1 appy and 1 pizza. The pizza has 8 slices, 12\")
The place is intimate, on the smaller side but there is lots of seating at the bar. It is set up for eating.
I personally would not bring kids to a wine bar but 2 wee ones were seated next to us and it just changed the whole scene.
We skipped dessert and coffee and hit up the candy store 2 doors down!
Would return to Una. I would like to try their pasta dishes!"}
{"text":"Great service and interesting food. I've been out of town for a while and I can't comment on the price versus the market. I had their special, a \"deconstructed shepard's pie\" pizza, a flat-crust pizza with thinly-sliced potato, peas, ground beef, and some kind of fancy cheese. Worth trying."}
{"text":"Great casual Pizza spot on 17 Av..
the margharita is a must. we love the shave zucchini marinated in olive oil and lemon...
Thank you to kelly and jaimie for this cool spot in Calgary...
G"}
{"text":"I don't know how I haven't reviews this place when I've gone numerous times! But here I am now. Hands down my fave pizza place for gluten free pizza.

They have a great selection, my fave is the prosciutto. Plus they have a huge wine list, even though I'm a champagne drinker. 

Very cute inside, I like the contemporary industrial design. My only complaint is not being able to book resos. I like to plan and know when I'm eating. You can follow them on twitter and they will post weight times though."}
{"text":"Good but disappointed, as I know excellent pizza from good, and the distance between the two is easy to discern.

A few people told me about how good Una Pizza was, but when I got there and ordered one of their recommended pizzas with a drink, it was, quite simply, underwhelming.

Great pizza is hard to find! The dough is the foundation, the sauces form the flavour base, and the ingredients all have to hit the sweet spot, and price does the rest. 

These semi-gourmet fresh-made pizzas are very good, but just not that special. 
Want a treat of a pizza for a mere $12 instead of $20-30?
Check out the nifty little fast Blaze pizza place on 4th Street in Mission, and be pleasantly surprised.

As for Una, if you live nearby and like the ambience of 17th Avenue on a warm summer night, by all means. But for anyone claiming to be a foodie, this pizza isn't what it could be.

Too bad."}
{"text":"Hello Sexy! 

First off I have to start with raves about the service. 
I have been in the service industry since I have been 16 and let me tell you, the servers last night at UNA would make me look like the meanest most lazy server. They were even nice to the homeless guy who came in and ask for food. 

We arrived at UNA at 745pm after trying to make a reservation prior, (they don't make them). We were greeted very nicely by a very friendly, attractive hostess. Told that they would take our phone # and call us back when they had room for us. (45 mins) 

We showed up 45 mins later and decided to have a jug of wine and party in the entrance. 30 mins later our table was ready. 

Our server, 'BRITTNI' who could be the most honest sweet person in the industry welcomed us. Took the time to tell us about the menu and have playful banter without missing a beat on with the other tables. 

Lets get to the good stuff, the food.

We ordered: 

-Fresh Tomatoes roasted with sea salt and sherry vinegar, served with crustinis ($7, wish there was more then 4 crustinis, but worth the price) 
-Goat cheese and boar bacon stuffed mushrooms ($9, 100% delicious, but 5 small mushrooms for a steep cost) 

and two pizzas. (with the most delicious crust!!!)

-Mushroom with truffle oil ($19) real quartered mushrooms, parm, arugula...TO DIE FOR! 
-Prociutto($20) BORING! this pizza alone lost UNA one of the stars for me, totally stingy on the prosciutto. ohhhh UNA! 

and my fav order of the night (besides the half litter of wine ($23, red house) was the 
Q WATER. 
($2/per person) 
sparkling or flat, all you can drink of the 4 time distilled house water. 
At first I thought these people are outta there mind and heading for a 2 star rating by charging for water, but I love Perrier, and 2 bucks for something that fizzes better... I will be back because of it. 

Alright lets Quick pro/con this place 

PROS: 

-Brittni, our server 
-The call back system 
-Its hip 
-the food! BEST pizza resturant in Calgary!!

CONS: 

-Stingy on the Prosciutto( tisk tisk) 

All in all, you'd think the hour and a half wait would have soured me, but its warm and welcoming place to be on a Friday night, good company, good background music, good water, FANTASTIC service! 
Cant wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great.  Wine selection is good.  Small plates are yummy.  The wait on sat night for 2 wasn't too bad ... 35 mins or so (no reservation allow).  We really enjoyed this \"hip\" new restaurant.  However the pizza is ok only.  If you want great pizza, this is not the right place.  But we can't wait to return and try their other small dishes and they have few large plates.  Great dating place!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome visited from Vancouver and I was sceptical about food with honey but the 4 cheese pizza proved me wrong. It was so good and had so much fun with my friends. The only downside is that they don't have pitchers but it's just a small thing in the end"}
{"text":"My boyfriend mentioned wanting to try UNA for awhile so we popped in one night as he was showing me around Calgary and I'm super glad we did! They manage to get quite a few tables into the intimate space and initially I was s but concerned but it worked out ok. We both looked at the menu for only a servings and the first thing that caught or eye was the Beltliner pizza so we decided on that. We had eaten a late lunch so opted to only order pizza even though the appetizers sounded delicious. The pizza crust was different from what I've had in the past and reminded me a bit of saltine crackers without the salt - it was delicious! The dough complimented the flavors of the cheese, meat, and maple syrup of the Beltliner perfectly! We left no crumb behind and soaked up as much syrup as we could with every bite. Definitely would visit again when in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Hey BlackBerry, we checked out your pizza joint. Twas delicious. Erika and Steve from Brooks."}
{"text":"I like UNA and wish I had the fiscal means to visit this place post-club.

The first time I came here I tried their version of the BLT which was a great and hefty sandwich to consume. In the second time I finally got a chance to try their pizza. Baked in a thin crust, the dough was as fresh as it's toppings. I wish I had the utensils to mimic this quick-cook Mediterranean style thin dough pizza. The best part was that we ate our pizza with a cracked egg in the center. Yeah I'd imagine this was the place I'd go to after a bad date and not eat my feelings but rather remind myself that I'm awesome enough to deserve amazing pizza.

Their tiny bar area is a sociable place. Me and a Lady eavesdropped on a bunch of guy's attempting to impress a girl. They bought her free rounds of wine/alchohol which she playfully took a sip off and rejected. Eventually some older dude in a powersuit just gave her a piece of his pizza and chatted her up the whole night. Moral of the story? Pizza rules."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have yet to be disappointed. I always order the same thing: kale salad, a couple of bacon wrapped dates and the four cheese pizza. For two people, this is more than enough food. The patio is fun for people watching. The last time, we saw an almost car accident and a few pedestrians ask if they could try our pizza. The only negative is the obnoxious sound of super loud motorcycles, but hopefully with the new noise bylaw, this will disappear. Still one more month of patio weather!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant twice in the last two months and each time it was truly outstanding! Not only is the food totally delicious, but the service from JENNA is EXCEPTIONAL. She is so professional; so kind and caring! It is really a privilege to be served by her! The restaurant could not have a better and more conscientious employee!  Right now 17th avenue is under construction, making it difficult to get into UNA...But it is really worth the effort!"}
{"text":"I did not expect to be eating some of the best pizza I've ever had in Calgary but Una Pizza delivers every time! If you are reading this review looking for a good pizza place to hit up tonight then stop your search right now as you've found it! 

You should have already stopped reading this review by now and be out of the door."}
{"text":"4 Maggi pizza and Sausage is what I've tried. Paired with tartastic beer. It's a Hawaii inspired bar as I noticed male servers arr wearing floral tops like the one in Luau! I might switch my beer flavor to tartastic whenever I'm into this place. They're very light. The place is along the lively 17th avenue 6th Street where people can see what's on your plate if you seat facing the walk way. Over all, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here! The staff is extremely nice especially the bartenders. There is something really special about being seated at the bar. You get to watch them make their amazing Old Fashioned. Its a must see!! The pizza is good especially with the Chili oil. The pizza isn't the same without it. I would have to recommend the beltliner pizza or the sausage pizza. Both are very good!"}
{"text":"Amazing thin crust pizza with unique flavor combinations, casual atmosphere, excellent service - what more could you ask for?!  We stopped by UNA twice during our trip to Calgary and were pleasantly surprised by the taste of fresh ingredients - we especially loved the Beltline pizza, and the hint of maple syrup to finish the pizza made it perfect.  We stopped by on a Sunday when they had their $5 specials and got the Kale Caesar Salad, which was delicious, in addition to their wonderful pizza! So keep tabs on their social media for any specials and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed and for good reason. 

A group of 5 of us stopped in after work for a couple bottles of wine, some amazing tapas, and a pie or two. It has a perfect atmosphere for good lively conversation.

I highly recommend the stuffed persian dates and the veal & pork meatballs for starters and either the mushroom, bianca or prosciutto pies. Amazing. 

Here is the full menu: http://unapizzeria.tumblr.com/"}
{"text":"I tried Una for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and was very impressed. After Wicked Wedge gave me food poisoning (yes, from a pizza!), I was very happy for the change!

Now I love a good pizza, and Una definitely hit the mark for me! Waaaay better than Double Zero!  I had the prosciutto with arugula and it was fabulous!

But if you're going to go to Una, you HAVE to try the dates! They stuff them with walnuts, wrap them in prosciutto,and bake them so the prosciutto is crisp. Drizzle some balsamic and dab in a bit of sea salt. Perfection! We each had one to start, and had to go back for another round for dessert."}
{"text":"Ok, I am in love with Calgarys food culture.  Edmonton is not too far behind and this is what they need!

Casual Italian, awesome pizza, responsibly done. And wicked wine list. 

We got there just before 615, so only had to wait 15 mins in a weekday. It's always jammed so try to come early!  No worries we had some wine in line!  Great spot to look at the menu and learn about the place.  They actually have their urban beekeepers Liscence as well, so I was into trying their honey!  They have a bee farm by Airdrie and do tours for kids as well.  

So started with the amuse bouche. One bite for $2 it was a bacon wrapped date with a walnut inside.  So simple and just spectacular!!   Do it!!

Next did the Kale Caesar salad that was recommended.  Great salad and huge.  

They've got lots of gluten free stuff there as well so its great if you need GF!  The pizza crust was awesome.  

We went with the prosciutto and arugula and drizzled their fresh honey on it.  Was to die for.  For wine we wnt with the house wine which at the time was a Californian merlot.  Was quite nice.   The rest of the list can get pricy, so be aware of your wines.  

They also did some nice GF desserts.  I went with the chocolate peanut butter torte.  It was nice and light.  Great to share.  

For sure coming back here.  Would be fun with a group on the way out for a night.  

Service was a bit rushed but they were very attentive.  I think there is a balance between being busy and not rushing you too much. And he did that well. Wasn't pushing but there a lot and moving things along.  We hadots to talk about so this restaurant might not be the one for a quiet romantic long talk night.  

It was SUPER LOUD, which adds to its atmosphere, but if you want a quiet night, pick a different spot.  One of my new GoTos on 17th ave!"}
{"text":"I love UNA it's always packed, it's local and the food is superb. I wish we had more places like this in Calgary especially in the far south but the city taxes businesses to death so I can see why. My favorite pizza is the cheese it may sound boring but it's anything but. Deliciously crisp thin crust with a cheesy goodness top, honey and a touch of truffle oil... Divine. Kale Cesar is top notch and I can go on and on. Wine choices are unique and I heard they just opened up a wine and takeout side. Run don't walk to 17th and enjoy this gem. Bonus- ask for the special hot oil sauce. Guaranteed to kick up your taste buds."}
{"text":"Una pizza is a regular go to for myself and my partner for date nights. The food is excellent and the service is usually great. Sometimes on busy nights you will be waiting a long time for your food. My go to order is the mushroom truffle oil pizza and I add prosciutto :)"}
{"text":"My first stop when I arrived in Calgary and honestly I loved it !
The kale Caesar was fabulous and the 4-maggi  pizza w pecorino cheese and truffle oil and honey (I know doesn't sound great but so was) was one of the best pizzas ever!
Light and crispy tasty crust too!
I will be back!"}
{"text":"We arrived mid rush on a Friday night and were greeted by Tom the host. He was very helpful and took my number so he could call us once a table once open. We then went down the street to the Ship and Anchor and waited. Not long after that we headed back to check since I had a hockey game at 11pm and we didn't have much time. Tom said he was just clearing a table and was about to call and took us in almost right away. Great timing!

Our server was great, she came by often and kept the table clean and clear of unneeded items. The first dish was the meatballs, they were a little more dry then we expected but the sauce was superb. We then got the pizza, mushroom pizza with truffle oil, arugla, parm cheese, and crimini mushrooms. The aroma coming off of it was amazing! We also got the winter squash risotto. While the pizza was a hit the risotto left something to be desired. It lacked salt and pepper, key things in my mind when it comes to risotto, and the rice was clearly at least a day old. It was breaking and had a chalky interior to it rather then a nice fresh rice. Too bad as we both love eating and making risotto. Later on I mentioned the pepper issue to our server and she was apologetic then engaged me in a nice chat about likes and dislikes when it comes to pepper. 

The atmosphere of the place is nice, busy, and a great place for people watching. All in all a great choice for dinner but next time we will try another dish instead of the risotto."}
{"text":"They have changed their recipe for the pizza crust.  It seems that Una has become so successful that they can see that there are enough suckers walking down 17 Ave, and enough posers in this city that don't know how to boil a egg , that they can get away with throwing customers poor quality food at premium prices. The crust was pale, dry and tasteless.

It has been a while since we have been there. Last night we had the Tiki and the sausage pizza, my partner requested prosciutto has an extra. It was there all right, burned to a  crisp, like little brittle match sticks. I don't care what you are making, prosciutto should never be cooked, it ruins it. What an amateur move.

The dates were also a disappointment, drowning in balsamic and again burnt prosciutto. The shrimp dish was tasteless.

The key lime pie, was also missing something... the citrus !!  It should be called  no lime pie.  

I will say our waiter was very nice and the service was decent. The general consensus from the other reviews was slow and snobby service, however we do not find that to be the case last night . 

Unfortunately I cannot recommend this place for food anymore, and I used to love it."}
{"text":"Ordered the proscuitto pizza and the 4cheese w/honey and truffle oil pizza after hearing people talk so highly of this place. Eh...have had better pizza everywhere else. The bottom of the crust was super hard to chew and seemed a little undercooked on both pizzas and the proscuitto was the worst prosciutto I've ever had. Super thick and more like pepperoni which was strange. Pass."}
{"text":"Good pizza, atmosphere and service. I suggest getting their formaggi pizza (very rich tasting) and their kale Caesar salad.

Can have very long wait times so I suggest you put down your name and get a drink at the national or their sister restaurant (ox and Angela) while you wait."}
{"text":"the margarita pizza was like tomatoe soap with bread.  Its quite good but too overpriced."}
{"text":"I can't complain about the food at Una's - everything is so delicious. My favourite has to be the prosciutto pizza with arugula.. it's the best! And I can't say I didn't love everything I've tried at Una's.

I do have some complaints about this place though. No reservations, extremely long wait times, and most of the time the place is SO loud, it's difficult to carry out a conversation.

Seeing as how successful and popular Una has been, I hope that they have plans to make the place bigger to accommodate more people in the future :)"}
{"text":"Always awesome. Wait is usually long if you are more than 2 people. I have never had something I didn't like. The truffle honey cheese pizza is perfect. I Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First off: pizza was delicious. Our group ordered the 4-maggi, beltline and Quattro carne. My favourite is the belt line, love the maple syrup on it. Also get the chili oil on the side, it's good to dip the crust in. 

As for the atmosphere, it was so-so, I'm not a huge fan of being cramped at a table with tables on either side of us that don't give you a lot of room to get out. The restaurant is narrow and small, they could really benefit from having a bigger space, the one in Saskatoon is significantly bigger and it makes all the difference for me. 

The service was excellent, our waiter was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"No reservations, so get yourself there early and put your name on the list. Walk down the street, have a pint, and come back for some delicious pizza.

Service? They got you.
Wine? You know it.
The reason you came. That Za?
Forget about it.

Need more?
Sit down and order the 4 maggio. I don't even know if that's what it's called. Cheese. Truffle oil. Honey.
Come on.

*mic drop*"}
{"text":"I'm from Toronto and the pie here is better on my opinion.  The truffle honey is Amaze balls!

So glad I tried this place out."}
{"text":"Parking was a bit difficult. The kale salad was delicious and perfect to share with 5 people. Service was great and we had three pizzas to share which was too much so there were leftovers the next day. The mushroom pizza was the best according to my cousin buf i liked the cheese pizza with truffle oil, which had a sweetness, saltiness combination. The \"wings\" appetizer was actually boneless thigh meat and was worth purchasing just for the dipping sauce. I suggest to try the chili oil rather than the pepper flakes on the pizza."}
{"text":"Kale Cesar salad was amazing.  Attentive staff, totally welcoming of my 7 and 9 year old boys.  Pizza, calamari and steak- delicious.  The sauce for the steak was too spicy for my kid, but the flavours were so amazing, I used it as a dip for my pizza crust.  Love how family friendly place this is, with such tasty food to enjoy!!"}
{"text":"My favourite place for pizza (the 4-Maggi!) and their kale salad is amazing! We have been to UNA takeaway also when the wait at the restaurant was too long, and it was good also."}
{"text":"4 Maggi comes with truffle oil ( I don't like truffle oil ) double smoked bacon was sold out due to no bacon 

Prosciutto and sausage instead

Sausage loaded with caraway seeds (sigh, licorice pizza)

Read the menu closely, there is nothing traditional about it, you might love it, I am remembering Italy and this is nothing like that"}
{"text":"We got Margarita and Cheese Pizzas and Tagliatelle Pasta. Everything was yummy. Amazing service as well.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"A-List for hipster buzz. They have the beats and the vibe, the well heeled and dressed, the trendsetters, the wannabes and the cool cats. You'll enjoy the plethora of sights and sounds to be sure. As for the food, I'm with the other reviews that aren't fuelled by hormones, hype, alcohol, popularity or other motives. The food is good. Period. It's a good establishment. However, there's better pizza elsewhere, for sure. The service was solid once you got inside the door. PS. If you go, don't wait in the line to get inside. Get to the door and talk to the server. Parties of 2 will get seated much faster than the rest. Overall. a fun experience but not necessarily a be-back. As always, for real."}
{"text":"Delicious kale salad and really good meatballs and sauce. The four cheese pizza is good but you HAVE to add prosciutto to it so it becomes phenomenal. Pizza- great crust! I liked the chilli pepper jar for your pizza as well. The only problem is that the pizza does take a little while to come- it's a small but super busy place, even on a cold Tuesday night."}
{"text":"I am a fan! Visiting from out of town.  Here four nights...I ate here twice.  Great food, great service. Great people watching.  Great scene.  I am giving it (3) $ because, with two glasses of wine and a pizza I was at $60+."}
{"text":"I love Una! They have great pizza and good service considering how busy they get.  I have nothing but good things to say about this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I would give it 3 stars for the nice simple pizza, but a smidge high pricing on the pizza, on the small side tagliatele portion size and the gall to charge $3 for EACH pop one orders knocks it down a star.

Pizza is more like the pizza I had in rural italy, simple, chunky toppings, not overloaded, ultra thin crust, done in a inferno oven for moments giving it that bubbly texture. It's cheap to make in Italy, regarded as quick and easy peasant food, but alas isn't priced accordingly at UNA.

It is delicious though, way better than the over the top \"everything and the kitchen sink\" Boston Pizza style.

Tagliatele was rather on the small side, no way is that $15.

I checked the bill after I walked out, thinking it seemed a bit high. $3 for EACH pop? 

What the duck guys? Nearly every man and his dog has no charge refills. Come on! Being an ex-publican I know that postmix is 2-3 cents to make for a half pint.

Bonus though, the waitresses are adorable and there's usually plenty eye candy about.

But, I think I will stick to the pizza place next to the Tilted Tit - sorry, Tilted Kilt."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this late night (open until 1am daily) pizzeria since 2011, and have not had a disappointing visit to date! Ordered the mushroom pizza, containing: roasted cremini mushrooms, truffle oil, smoked mozzarella + grana padano cheese, fresh arugula.

The roasted mushrooms give the pizza a \"meatiness\" without the animal, and the bite of the arugula cuts through the mushroom's umami and unctous of the smoked mozzarella. 

Getting both complimentary chili flakes and chili oil provide two different kinds of \"kick\" to your pizza experience: the flakes adding the smokey heat, the oil giving a slight tang when drizzling on your crispy thin pizza crust.

Highly recommend sitting at the bar when eating solo: the energizing vibe with old school playlists and engaging conversations with fellow bar-loungers will only heighten your UNA experience :)"}
{"text":"It's a personal space where you're forced to converse with the people you walked through the doors with, which I think is the point. There's generally a wait, but they're more than willing to text or tweet you when your seat is ready. The service is good. The atmosphere is good. The food is good. Can't really as for much more."}
{"text":"We went here because we heard they had a great sliced pineapple tika pizza.  I'm gluten sensitive and was hesitant to try a new place.  The paper sculptures on the wall were creative, colourful and whimsical.  The tables for 2 were a little small for plates and food.  There was a nice breeze from the open front patio screen (it was a beautiful night out!) 

Some issues though.  It was puzzling to me that they would not serve diet cola to my girl friend (there are non-aspartame options such as stevia cola). Regardless, the tika pizza was good but my pizza appeared to have been cross-contaminated based on my reaction later on that night. We called and the owner committed reviewing contamination issues with the staff (greatly appreciated he listened)."}
{"text":"Came for an early dinner. So glad there wasn't the usual wait, definitely best to come ~5pm as the place fills up quickly on weekdays.

Initially I was put off by the mention of filtered water for $2 per person on the menu. (Water was offered without any price indication) Thankfully the charge for water did not appear on the final bill.

We had the Sambuca sautéed shrimp and salami pizza. The shrimp were perfectly cooked and very tasty, although the portion of bread could be bigger to mop up the sauce. The pizza was properly cooked with flavourful crust and great toppings.

Glad to see a proper pizza alternative to Famoso.

Will definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"Your web site stinks. .
Online right. to hard to order."}
{"text":"OoOoH PiZzA!!! Calgary's Trendy and Local Hotspot. UNA serves the Best Pizza in Calgary, (For a Italian Thin Crust), The Margherita has always been my number 1, until this Summer and is now my #2, The 4-Maggi is now the My Best PiZzA In UNA, 4 cheese,drizzled w/truffle oil and Honey. Simply Delicious!! When I eat solo, I enjoy stool seating by the chef, watch them construct my pizzas and more. And table seating when in a group, or a Date. There seems to be low employee turnover and if you frequently eat here, the staff will begin to know you by name, the service is always great. I love that they offer water immediately and I end up drinking more water here than any other restaurant. Ok, so my recommendations are almost everything on the menu, I have a few of my favorites, the Flat Iron Steak is definitely great and shareable, the Pan Seared Wings are amazing, with a spicy Harissa sauce. Tagliatelle pasta is yummy, when I'm really hungry. But my overall favorites, sambuca prawns and sautéed cauliflower which I noticed are not on the menu anymore, may come back soon, their menu changes are great, they add new, take out some, always a great change. But the service and food remain always the same, GREAT!!!"}
{"text":"This place is always our go-to place whenever we come down from Edmonton. The pizza are awesome, the ingredients are fresh and wine pairing are delicious. I've tried almost all their pizzas. The wings are nice as well, but the pizza the superstar. The ambiance is nice and the crowd is smart. Servers are always nice and upbeat and make great recommendations. Absolutely love it here!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great atmosphere! Unbelievably busy for a Saturday afternoon, but seeing as we  just needed a table for 2 we got seated very quickly. Our waiter was  friendly & attentive. The prosciutto pizza was DELICIOUS! We will fer sure be back!"}
{"text":"Una is my unicorn that poops rainbows and I love the warm fuzzy feelings I get every time I come here. It honestly can do no wrong. 

I rarely give five stars and Una deserves this because it slays and it CONSISTENTLY slays every single time I've eaten here, and trust me, I've eaten here lots. The food and service is top notch every time. 

Their Kale Caesar salad is mind blowing and is the best Kale salad in the city. Copy cats can try to duplicate it, but I've yet to find a close equal. Their meatballs are fresh and tasty and their calamari, despite departing from the standard deep fried method, is served in a putanesca sauce and is refreshingly delicious. 

You can't go wrong with any of the pizzas. The crust is thin, sturdy and not prone to sogginess which is a HUGE plus! There's nothing worse than soggy pizza crust! The pizza special of the day frequently sells out by dinner time so you'll have to catch it at lunch. My favorites are Tiki and Prosciutto. 

I'm so happy Una exists in Calgary. I wish there were more places like this in the city, but translated from latin, Una means \"one\". It all makes sense if you think about it - there is only *one* unicorn in my life and that only *one* is Una."}
{"text":"I was disappointed that they didn't offer sangria on their menu especially considering that it is such a summer staple, but our server offered to get me an amaretto sour instead which I did really enjoy. However I found the service to be a shade lacking. Once our food came out she didn't come back to check how everything was tasting once. I mean everything was fine but it's nice to have someone come back to make sure just in case. Other than those 2
Minor issues Una pizza + wine was an amazing choice for lunch. Will surely be going back"}
{"text":"Great place that I and a friend stumbled upon. Enjoyed two delicious appetizers: one was roasted asparagus with an egg, combined with a aioli mayonnaise. It was good. The second was roasted zucchini with pine nuts, melted parmesan cheese and dill- very tasty.
We also shared a vegetarian pizza of artichokes, feta etc- it was very nice but needed some extra spice so we added a bit of chilis. Crust so very crisp and thin, which is a nice change from my usual pizzas made at home.
Definitely enjoyed the meal, and the service was attentive without being obtrusive."}
{"text":"Hipster and trendy, the atmosphere is great. The pizza, however, is not amazing. It's definitely above average though, but also overpriced. Trying to get a table in the evening is also a waste of time, I've had to wait 45 minutes to an hour every single time I've been here."}
{"text":"Nice place, 2nd visit. Went there on a sarurday night for dinner. Had the muchroom pizza with trolly 5 + UNA beer. It is prob an UPA. Beer was ok. The mushroom pizza was tasty, nice crust, well baked, and the right amount of spices and herbs. Busy place. Used the NoWait app, would recommend downloading it:) Popular place among locals. Would likely visit again. 4/5"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! Highly recommend this modern, casual spot! Good red wine on the list and the pizza was great! Service was phenomenal as well. Nothing bad to say about this place!"}
{"text":"I was visiting in town for a friends wedding and we all stumbled upon this place late Sunday night. Service is very prompt and pizzas are tasty. You definitely can finish one pizza person and don't be alarmed by the high wait times. Service moves fast and you would be surprised how quick you will get a table."}
{"text":"I moved away from Calgary 3 years ago now but every time I come back for a visit, a mushroom pizza from Una is a must! I've tried mushroom/fungi pizzas from various restaurants in Edmonton and Calgary and hands down, Una's is the best! They put a good amount of toppings on the pizza and the arugula, truffle oil and mushroom pairing is so addictive and amazing. I have even had my sister bring Una to Edmonton for me. Their kale Caesar salad and peanut chocolate dessert is also delicious.

I would say the only downside to Una is that the venue is quite small and they are almost always busy - meaning no reservations and usually a wait between 30mins to over an hour but they let you have wine while you wait so that's a plus."}
{"text":"We went with our lovely servers recommendation when we were here for supper a couple weekends ago and we are sure glad that we did! 
We were torn between the Quatro fromagi pizza and the prosciutto and arugula, so our server recommended adding prosciutto to the Quatro fromagi. 
What an excellent idea! The crust is reminiscent of true Italian thin crust and toppings were interesting and flavourful. The house made chili sauce adds a nice bit of heat without being overwhelmingly spicy. 

Honorable mentions to our starter prawns in sambucca sauce. Prawns were cooked perfectly but come with 5. A little pricey for 5 prawns. 

Thrilled to see some okanagan wines on the list. 

Overall we will return to try some of the other pizzas on the list. Service was one of the best we have had in the city so far."}
{"text":"Since I have had two days to eat the leftovers (no one else wanted them) and since they were actually pretty tasty,  I have decided to add an additional star to this restaurant, overall. 

My best advice is to see for yourself, but don't expect more than that."}
{"text":"The pizza is sooooo delicious here! I'm going to crave the 4-maggi forever. It's loaded with cheese, honey, and truffle oil, but tastes amazingly light. I've been here a few times with friends and the prices are really fair and you can get a cheap meal if you split, too. Otherwise, the tagliatelle, lamb meatballs was good, and I've tried most of their pizzas, which are all quite good. I can't remember the name specifically, but I never thought that arugula could taste so good on pizza. Then again, I've never been to Italy. I can't tell what's authentic, but this definitely more so than Domino's. I can't wait to try the desserts! My friends were pretty mad that we got jipped into paying extra for their fancy house Q-water, though. I can't say if that's worth. 

I don't know if it's just my odd times -I go in the late afternoon- but every time I go there hasn't really been a wait and we were always able to get seating (for groups ranging form 2-6 people)."}
{"text":"The Pizza and wine were both excellent. My wife and I had the Beltline and the Margarita pizza.  I would definitely recommend giving both a try. The Beltline seems like a very weird combo but somehow it all works to make a great tasting pizza. UNA would be great for a casual date night or a night out with a few friends, but not too many as the space is a bit small"}
{"text":"UNA Pizza + Wine is notorious for having crazy long lineups as it's one of those no reservation type of restaurants. They've been packed every single time that I've visited except for during our most recent one! Forget about waiting 1-2 hours on Friday or Saturday evening unless you enjoy that type of thing. You could always mosey over to another spot on 17th Ave or else check out their sister restaurant, Ox and Angela.

Inspired by California pizza joints, UNA focuses on doing one thing well. Pizzas. Does it live up to all the amazing pizza spots in California? Pizzaria Delfina was the first thing to jump into my mind after reading about their Cali influences. That place is legit. If you're ever in San Fran, check them out.

The art lining the walls is funky and fresh with a bunch of cool people-cheese inspired sketches. The place itself is long and narrow with tables packed tightly together. You could say it's cramped but that's part of it's charm/hipster factor. They also have a little patio on the outside that's perfect for people watching in the summer time.

So random but hilarious at the same time - they have a Harry Potter audiobook playing in the washrooms to sooth you over. Lumos! I like how they are open every day until 1am! Nothing like some quality late night eats.

Menu is pretty concise - \"not\" pizza, appetizers, salads and pizza! If you don't want to wait in line, I'd suggest checking their Twitter feed before you head over.

- Kale caesar salad ($15.00) - boiled egg, toasted panko, crisp prosciutto and pecorino romano. As my sis can't eat gluten nor egg, we got the boiled egg on the side and without the toasted panko. Perfect for me as I'm not the biggest fan unless that egg is in ramen! I feel their egg would be much better if it was runny over being boiled. Blah. Sans egg, this is still one of my sister's favourite salads - she orders it every single she comes here. The kale had a nice crunchy element to it and I like how the caesar dressing isn't too creamy but tastes light and healthy. Would I order it myself? Debatable.

- Mealshare feature pizza ($20.00) with gluten free pizza crust ($3.00) - San marzano tomato sauce, roasted eggplant, burrata cheese, fresh fennel, fresh prosciutto. You know I'm down for anything with eggplant in it so we obviously had to order the feature pizza. The pizza here is thin crust and it has a nice crunchy bite to each slice. The toppings were interesting (never had fennel on pizza before) but there wasn't any bursts of flavour for my taste buds. Good, just not great like Cali pizza spots. I've had their mushroom pizza ($17.00) on a previous visit and felt the same way.

UNA is a solid place to grab some high(er) end pizza. It's pretty impressive that the kitchen can do everything gluten free as this is pretty hard to find in most restaurants. If you want good food and to be part of the trendy hipster scene, this is definitely your spot. My advice is come early or late (aka. during off-times), or better yet, head over on Sunday afternoon like we did for no line."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I have had outside of Italy. Great staff, cool interior, funny bathroom signs + audio book readings in the bathroom, great wine list."}
{"text":"This place is always busy and is now one of my favourite restaurants in Calgary. The pizza is great, service is friendly and they have some great menu items besides pizza that are fresh and simple but beautifully flavoured and prepared. You should go. 
They don't take reservations so be prepared to wait, they will however take your cell number so you can go have a beer down the street and they will call when your table is ready. Love it."}
{"text":"This review is for service alone, as it was due to the service that had us find alternate eating arrangements.
We went in last night late around 10 pm for a very late dinner.... however we were greeted if greeted can be used as the correct word by a very b*tchy (can I use that word on Yelp?) hostess.... who rolled her eyes and told us it was a 30 minute wait for a table for 2.
HOWEVER...... 
There were empty tables for 4. We asked if we could split one of those, she said no that is a table for 4. we asked if we could sit at one of those, she again said no as were were 2 people and it was a table for 4. We asked about sitting at the open bar, she again said no they closed the bar. Then she got snotty and said she'd hate to not have to seat us at all. So we left.
But UNA.. I really did want to try your pizza, maybe she was having an off night, but your hostesses should be friendly, and helpful. especially when there is no line up at 10 pm on a Thursday night. I can understand wanting to keep your 4's if it was a Friday or Saturday but on a Thursday?
And to not split them up seems ridiculous.
If they were not being used, and we sat at one, what harm would it cause if there was another one already, by that point should any 4's come in that late we could have moved to a smaller table if necessary."}
{"text":"I suggest to get the salami pizza it was one of the best pizza I have had in my life."}
{"text":"The pizza is so tasty and their salads are great! My son even loves their pizzas. I really love the unique drinks they offer here as well. Service is great. Atmosphere is great. Love UNA!!"}
{"text":"There are so many positive reviews of Una that I will only briefly add to the chorus of Yelpers that have enjoyed their meal.  First of all - a Harry Potter audio book playing in the bathroom?! Seriously delightful.  There was another book being read when I left, although I didn't recognize the title it made going to the bathroom pretty fun.  Since I did not see any reviews commenting on parking, I would recommend taking transit or walking.  I'm not familiar with this area of Calgary, but the restaurant was on a busy street and there was no street parking out front.  I expect that there are pay lots in the vicinity, but nothing adjacent to the restaurant.  We went at 4:00 pm on a Saturday and were seated immediately, but there was a large line out the door by the time we left (6-ish).

Our food here was as good as I expected!  My group of three tried three different pizzas: the Tiki, which is their take on a Hawaiian, the four maggi (cheese), and the special of the day, which had honey mustard, arugula, and roasted chicken on it.  All were fantastic, and their crust is really unique.  It's soft, kind of chewy and held up all the toppings well.  I loved the super thin pineapple on my pizza, and my pineapple-hating husband loved it too, to everyone's surprise.  Top notch casual dining, and a perfect choice for pre-race carb loading."}
{"text":"What a concept, pizza and wine...fabulous! Small and intimate Una's Pizza delivers on all fronts. 

My husband is a meat eater and as such not so adventurious at times therefore we ordered the Salami Pizza to share. One word - YUM!  He did however anty up and share some starters with me. We had the Pintxo (daily special was smoked salmon), Walnut Stuffed Persian Date(s) and Sauteed Prawns in Sambuca. They were the perfect portions and appy's to share before the pizza came. The wine menu was impressive and we enjoyed a glass or two of Malbec.  Hubs & I had a great evening at Una.

The 2nd time I went I brought along 2 girlfriends so they could see why I loved this place.  There was a wait and so walked a couple doors down to a lounge and had a glass of wine while we waited to be called (they take your cell phone number, name and call you about 10 minutes before your table is ready).

Once we arrived back at Una we were seated and proceeded to order a bottle of wine & a few appetizers to share.  Walnut stuffed persian dates & the sauteed prawns were delish. We ordered a simple pizza as one of the ladies was not as adventurous as the other 2 so the margherita is what we inhaled.  Another great evening at Una.....I just love this place and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Pizza is delcious, staff is fast, friendly and genuinely knowledgeable about their fantastic wine selection, and they play audio books in the bathroom.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better pizza options in the area. A lively and usually happening place, with decent prices and great quality food and service.

On the busy nights, be prepared for a long wait before you get a table!"}
{"text":"Best hawaiian-style pizza I've ever had (The Tiki).  Really friendly staff and they make takeout orders easy.  Also had their amazing roasted broccoli.  What a great place."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I decided to do lunch at Una yesterday as I was working at the Calgary office downtown. I had been meaning to return here for a while, but my boyfriend isn't a huge fan of it so I haven't had the chance to come back. The service was spot on, luckily there was no wait and we were tended to right away. We ordered a couple glasses of prosecco and dove right in with the 4-Maggi and the Tiki pizzas. They were both delicious! I love the truffle oil used in the 4-Maggi and the bacon on the Tiki was perfect. My one complaint was the cheese on the 4-Maggi was extremely thick, not soft and gooey like I'm used to. I wasn't a huge fan of that, but next time I will probably just try something else."}
{"text":"My partner and i don't understand why this restaurant has great reviews. It had the worst pizza ever and I am the type who eats everything even if it doesn't taste that good. However, in this case the pizza was too bad for me to eat and very expensive too! It literally tasted like cardboard and a cheap pizza in a developing country tastes way better! Im not exaggerating! I think this is one place where ppl go to be seen because we really do not understand how it can still be serving its pizzas. Service was ok tho...just really bad pizza!"}
{"text":"Tried two kinds of pizza here the Beltline and Maggi pizza. So I loved the Maggi pizza the most. It was a bit greesy and yes it was also kind of too sweet. Overall, I really like the truffle taste of it. Beltline was not bad. First reaction when I saw it, I was like where is the meat. 

The good thing about Una is for $5, they will deliver. But they will only deliver in downtown area only. 

If you were to dine there, the restaurant is very small. Also its very busy. Will need to make a reservation for sure."}
{"text":"The kale Caesar salad is great, pizzas are usually quite good, and the peanut butter mousse dessert is incredible. Service is friendly and attentive, and they usually play an audiobook of Last Exit to Brooklyn in the bathroom. What more could you ask for?

Oh, and I hear Tron from Fubar applied to be a dishwasher here."}
{"text":"Great lively atmosphere and food. Just slightly too crowded for my liking though. Pizza is thin-crust and there are plenty of options to choose from. I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"I have to say I was kind of disappointed with paying $20 for a thin crust pizza that didn't wow me. The truffle oil is very fragrant and I do think the pizza types are creative...but I guess I expected more for paying so much."}
{"text":"I have been drawn to UNA since it opened, upscale pizza and wine? yuppp I am in! I finally went this evening with my girlfriend and we arrived at 5:30 pm on Thursday- it was already half full. Based on previous yelpers, I was aware to arrive early as this place doesn't take resos, and is rather a hot spot (which is why I have avoided it until now). I absolutely hate waiting in lines for dinner, i like to have a set time to meet and get my eat on, not wait having no idea when I might finally get a table. So usually if they don't take resos, I avoid. By 6 pm a line up had formed out the door.

I ordered the salami pizza and the 4 maggi, salami was soooo yumm. The 4 maggi was good, but a bit too sweet for my liking. To finish we ordered the peanut butter terrine- UM YUM. I could eat 10 of these and would go back just for it. If you love peanut butter like me, you will love it. 

Once the bill arrived I was surprised to see we were charged $4 for water, I find that tacky ( especially since we didn't want the water? We were looking at the wine menu straight away, yet he still said to start us off with some water while we were deciding).
I have to drop a star for this reason, and another star for the fact that they don't take reservations. As I am sure that isn't a problem for many others, I like to live on a schedule. The food here is very good though, and the service was good too."}
{"text":"I love love una pizza. There food is to die for and there wine selection is always changing and so good. The service can be a tiny bit slow when they have a full house. And reservations are a must if you want to get in fast. Honestly though I can't rave about the pizza enough. It is so good. We love the beltlibe and the 4 Maggie. Also this last time we went we enjoyed the octopus! Amazing!!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorites in the city! Never had a bad experience. Sometimes the wait staff can be a little awkward or rub you the wrong way but I think that's part of the whole experience. 
The 4maggi is a life changing experience, pizza without honey just isn't the same for me anymore. They also have the best margherita I've ever had, simple clean and tomato-y. I really haven't explored the menu much else, with the exception of those yummy olives and almonds, you really don't need to with pizza this good though!
If you're going, order wine. That's the point. Don't be foolish like me my first few times and waste your money getting one of their cocktails (that IMO are not that good) they charge upwards of 12$ for single!
I've never had much issue with a wait, it would be worth it even if I ever did though. 
My only real gripe with UNA is that they took their grilled cheese and tomato soup off the menu.. I remember sitting at the bar watching it get made several times and then more or less inhaling it.. that was my favorite and most comforting dish I have ever eaten.. anywhere. Period. 
UNA please bring back grilled cheese, if not.. you're still my favourite."}
{"text":"Very disappointed tonight Una.  For all your Calgary notoriety and reputation and all the glowing reviews, we experienced terrible service (the server actually sighed and rolled her eyes when we asked where the Una house Rosé was from - aren't you a \"wine bar\"?) , pisspoor broccoli that tasted over-cooked (almost microwaved)  and average shrimp (I can do better). The pizza crust wasn't even standoutish."}
{"text":"So far this is the best pizza we have found in the city. Its a small but busy place so next time we shall make reservations (we went on a whim at 5 pm but took us 20 mins to get a table for 2). The service was quick and efffcient. We sat at the kitchen bar so we could watch the chefs which was nice if your into that sort of thing. The pizza itself was good, all is thin crust and the selection is great. The crust was cunchy but the inner part was a little soggy with the toppings though. Overall it was a good experience and will go again!"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I waited over an hour to be seated... and I have never been so satisfied after waiting so long. A wine bar with unbelievable hand crafted pizza.. why aren't there more of these? The wine we had was amazing and the pizza was even better. God this place is great, they cook some of their pizza's with truffle oil - how amazing is that?

UNA is a tiny place, so there isn't much space to sit, and they don't take reservations. All of these factors contribute to it being similar to any wine bar you walk into in NYC. NYC stole my heart, and so does this place. I crave their pizza weekly, if not daily. Best part is they offer take-out, although I think part of the experience is sitting at the bar and watching them design your pizza. 

Cozy and quaint, UNA really brings something fresh to Calgary, which I really appreciate. I love the art work in this place and adore that they dim the lights and light candles; very romantic. If you haven't been to UNA, you need to go... seriously, go. 

UNA, I am forever yours!"}
{"text":"I went to UNA for a late night meal with a good friend. It was a fantastic experience.

We ordered the prawns to share, and then the sausage and four cheese pizzas. Of course, it was way too much food, but it was much appreciated the next day for lunch.

The pizzas are thin and tasty, and the prawns are made with a Sambuca-based sauce that is incredible (they give you bread for dipping). However, I've had amazing pizza in many places, it was the ambience that really got me.

UNA reminded me of the best parts of the Montreal dining scene. The restaurant was dimly lit, giving it a casual and cool vibe, as opposed to romantic. The crowd was completely mixed -- from couples in their 20s on a date to men in their 50s splitting expensive bottles and catching up. And the decor was interesting and reminded me of a bistro.

UNA is a great place for a meal with friends or someone you've been dating for awhile. It's almost too great to waste on a potentially bad first date."}
{"text":"Don't ask me how I've made it this long living in Calgary without visiting Una. I know, I know. Redonculous. But sometimes things are just that much sweeter when you wait for them :).

Last Wednesday eve, we were attempting to find a spot to eat some noms. What's open late on a Wednesday around midnight? Why, Una is! Turns out, it's a 1am close time 7 nights a week.

If you know me, you know I abhor waiting for things.. this includes any long-ish lineups. And so often, where there is a lineup, there is no Wendy. That was the beauty of Una this late on a weekday. No lineup. Our choices of tables. And despite it being one hour before closing, food and service that remained consistent with its reputation.

I wish I could say I devoured my entire pizza. The truth is, I devoured half of it. Then I was full. It was breakfast the next morning though. I ordered the tiki pizza - double smoked bacon, shaved pineapple, san marzano tomato sauce, smoked mozzarella and jalapeno oil. As you may have heard, bacon makes everything better. And with a name like tiki, how can you not order it on a cold day if only to pretend you're somewhere warm that would have words like \"tiki\" on the menu?

Solid late night eats, Una. I'll be back.. maybe not during your busiest of eves... but back nonetheless."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Calgary!

If you haven't tried Una, then you're missing out. Their 4-Maggi pizza is phenomenal, but that could be because I have a weakness for truffle oil. I also really like their kale caesar salad. It comes with an egg on it, so that could be unappealing to some people, but that is how traditional caesar salad should be, so I think it's delicious. 

Warning: Una does not take reservations. Expect to wait 45 mins+ if you are coming at lunch or dinner rush. They also do takeout so you can always call in advanced to order your pizza and take it home. I find it never tastes as good though, so it's better to dine in. 

Either way Una is a must try in Calgary, and the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Love the pizza.
The dough is just lovely. 
between 4 people you can definitely share 2 pizzas which is a shame cuz I wanted to try them all!!

Sat near the 'window' area of the open patio and it was nice cuz it felt like a patio but you were still inside. 

as many have said, ask for the chili garlic oil. :)"}
{"text":"Friends had recommended this place to me, so when I visited Calgary, I decided to stop by!  Boy was I pleasantly surprised!  Although I wasn't able to get a table, we ordered from the Una takeout side and was definitely one of the best pizzas I have eaten!"}
{"text":"Good service, good food, good wine, good atmosphere and good price point.  What more can i ask for? I was there on a rainy sunday evening and they were packed to the brim.  We had the walnut stuffed dates wrapped with prosciutto which I thought was really good.  My favorite is the mushroom pizza with truffle oil.  It had a generous amount of cremini mushrooms with good amount of truffle flavor. Now please will you open a location in Edmonton? :)"}
{"text":"I would, without hesitation, give Una a four- or five-star review, if it weren't for some of the service staff doing their best to knock it down to three-stars.

The last two times I've visited Una, I've gone with a friend, with the intention of having a few quick appetizers and a non-alcoholic beverage---basically in and out.

We're both former service staff, we both understand the importance of turnover, and we're both inclined to tip well.

However, the female server we've had on both occasions has taken a guilty-until-proven innocent approach, rolling her eyes when we ordered coffee, and essentially rebuking us when we only ordered two appetizers:  \"You're not having any pizza?  Just to let you know, what you've ordered is NOT a lot of food.\"  Translation:  \"Your bill total is going to be small and I'm going to get a small tip.\"

Way to make us feel unwelcome.  We were in and out of there in probably half the time people who ordered pizza were, and thus the restaurant gets extra revenue, and she gets more tips, just by virtue of the increased turnover, not to mention the fact we usually tip around 30% unless you do something to knock it down, like you did here.

Anyway, perhaps Una could instruct its service staff to give customers the benefit of the doubt before assuming the worst."}
{"text":"Best pizza place in Calgary hands down. You've got to try the kale Cesar salad and 4 maggi!"}
{"text":"UNA has been worth the wait each and every time. Their servers match the excellent food and make the whole experience top notch. The thin crust pizza's have several levels of full flavor and are deceptively filling. I'm partial to the lamb merguez, which doesn't seem to be on the menu anymore, but their Tiki is also to die for. Prosciutto replaces ham in this Hawaiian ode and the drizzle of jalapeno oil really pops with the sweetness of the pineapple and the prosciutto's saltiness.

Their salad's are sizable and great to share, go for the kale caesar! Another must try is their roasted broccoli, which may change the way you view this veggie. Caramelized flavors, nutty and bright walnut vinaigrette with a touch of sharpness from grated pecorino. Writing about it makes me want to go there tomorrow.

Ambience is warm and intimate. It's always crowded but everyone is chatting so you never really notice the proximity of your fellow diners. As always it's fun to sit at the bar since watching the action is also great entertainment.

I've been very pleased with their wine selection for both the glass and bottle. It is pizza after all so it's affordable to find quality bottles.

UNA is a consistent staple and great for late bites as well, if you haven't been, go and go again!"}
{"text":"I feel like there's no real point in writing another glowing review for UNA but I'll do it anyway. I've tried a bunch of their menu items at this point and some favourites include:

Mushroom pizza. Obviously if you do not like mushrooms you will not enjoy this pizza. But if you love fungi like I do then this pizza is a must try. The truffle oil is not too strong and there so many mushrooms. I think this one is my favourite.

Margherita pizza. A nice simple classic. But you can actually taste the fresh basil and there isn't an overwhelming amount of cheese or crappy tomato paste. This one would be my second choice for a lighter option.

Artichoke heart pizza. The sundried tomatoes are not overwhelming and the lemon zest is a nice light counter to the rich cheese.

Arugula nut pesto spread with sourdough bread. I don't think they make the bread themselves but it is amazing. The eggplant and roasted garlic spread is also quite good. 

I've tried their mealshare pizza and plates a few times and haven't loved the plates although the one Californian pizza I had was awesome. 

One pizza is more than enough for two people; although you shouldn't worry about leftovers because they still taste amazing the next day! 

I love coming to UNA; the ambience is lovely, the food is delicious, and the people are friendly. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"So we went to UNA with high hopes for great food! what did we get? really good food! I loved it thought it was worth the hour that we had to wait to get inside!

So when we got to UNA the place was thumping with a lot of peeps! all stuffed into a relatively small space! It may not seem appealing but it actually kind of has a cool vibe when you are stuffed in their like a sardine! Anyway the hostess told us it would be about an hour wait and took my phone number! off we went to wet our hungry beaks and kill some time for the meal to come!

We went back and got some beers while waiting in the boot room and finally got a table. The three of us quickly ordered the white anchovy tapas! very nice! a great way to get things rolling! 

So then we ordered some appetizers. Salt cod brandade and some halved small potatoes with a dip! both were quite good! and I was pleased to see the portions being a decent size for the three of us!

Finally we got some pizza I went with the classic margarita ! It was delicious well prepared with good high quality Buffalo Mozza nice flavorful sauce . It had a great flavor and the crust was great! Was not to droopy but also had the crunch and a just a tiny bit of char on the edges! It was really good, and yes the toppings are a not piled on, but its a tribute to how they do it in italy !  the ingredients are of a higher grade so It makes sense to put less! less toppings also creates a different dynamic, every bit is a little different! I suspect that if UNA had a wood fire oven the pizza would be just a little bit better, they might have a bit more of an edge but I cant say it really made a huge difference in my mouth.

I tried the potato pizza, it was quite good but  the potatoes were a little to thick very sligtly undercooked! I also tried the bianca pizza, that one was also really good!

I love pizza! in all its forms! from greasy, sloppy, over topped deep dish! to thin crust ,wood fired, high grade ingriedient and simple ! UNA has their way and its certainly the more authentic way. All over europe you will find most pizza places cooking them in this fashion. So get your pizza hat on! this place certainly is worth eating at! I will be back ! ONE  DAY! Check it!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing. It was well worth the short wait. The staff was very pleasant from the efficient hostess to the very attentive bartender (I sat at the bar) to the water dude. The food was quite delightful. The prosciutto wrapped walnut stuffed dates were very unique and the four maggio pizza was among the best I've had. Just. Go. To. Ina."}
{"text":"Finally visited UNA! The food is great, service is good. But personally I just do not like they do not take reservation. The last couple times I went there, my friends and I just left becoz of the long line up. So yesterday my husband and I went there at 4:30(omg, I could not believe I had my supper that early!). And it was getting busy after 5:30.

The place is a bit narrow, not very kid friendly (washroom is big but no changing table, o...o...o... and the height of the hand dryer is so weird, difficult for users to put the hands in, plus the water on your hands would end up on your face, go try lol). But I enjoy my early dinner there while it's not busy!"}
{"text":"The service is above average. It really is but the Beltline pizza is something to be desired. My friends pizza was better but isn't nearly as good as comparable pizza in the area on 17th. The seating is ultra tight and the wait times are high almost always. It's definitely good pizza but for the wait the alternatives are definitely better."}
{"text":"I love their traditional Italian pizza and wine selection. My servers have always been friendly and eager to help with menu selections. Their pizzas are so good and it's easy to order a couple and spend the evening drinking and socializing all while snacking on some amazing pizzas!"}
{"text":"Una is super trendy!
The pizzas are awesome but my favourite is the kale salad. 
It gets a bit noisy which means it's a cool joint.
They change the wall art occassionally and there's usually a cool story behind each new piece."}
{"text":"A restaurant that advertises none acceptance of reservations turns me off. Being the sole pizzeria on 17 Avenue that has gluten free options it's a bit disheartening to wait at the door for hours on end. 

I don't mind the no reservation concept. But if you're a restaurant that does not accept reservations, you should not serve food at the bar where people can sit and wait. UNA does the pizzas greatly but the concept of the restaurant is wrong. 

PS: Taking my cellphone number down and calling me when a seat frees up is not a solution."}
{"text":"Pizza could be a religion. This could possible be the Church of Pizza. There are two great spots for pizza in my books, Una and Cilantro, interesting how they are a little over a block away from each other. Every single time, I fall in love all over again with Una. Tom Petty sings \"Waiting is the hardest part\"... but Una make waiting easy. They take down your number, you can grab a drink at a pub (there are numerous around), they call you, and your good to go. 

I dream about their kale cesar salad, olives and its always a toss up between the mushrooms and the 4 maggi. Hell get it all if you have a good amount of people with you. And wine, wine and more wine. 

It doesn't hurt that the staff is wonderful and easy on the eyes."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The atmosphere was inviting and cozy. We recommend the Beltliner!  The service was outstanding- especially Kathleen!  Make this place a must!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The kale Caesar salad is a must! The only thing that they loose a star for is the size of the space can't accommodate the demand. Be sure you make a reservation or expect to wait!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of this place for a while, but the last time I went seemed different. It seems as if they recreated their crust to be a little more bread like which offered more of a crunch to every bite. I usually prefer this over the usual \"pita-like\" crust because sometimes I find it too hard. I have always been a fan of the atmosphere too. Definitely one of the best spots on 17th Ave."}
{"text":"For years I have stuck to a very strict mantra: There is nothing better than a fabulous bottle of Red Wine and really delicious pizza. Nothing. Period.  For a long time that always meant getting delivery or take out, stopping by a liquor store, or pulling a great bottle out of one's wine rack, for most pizza places had less than average wine selections. I don't know why, that is just the way it was. It always seemed to me that wine and pizza is a natural fit; like eggs and bacon, Fred and Barney, bowling and odd shoes. Well, somebody else saw the genius of this natural fit too, and Voila... Pizza Una!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Calgary, Una just works.  

I recently had out of town guests in from Australia and took them to Una before a fun evening out.  We started out as 3 (our 4th person was late) and thus immediately ordered the pork and veal meatballs (1 each).  They are generously sized and served in an amazing tomato sauce and with bread for dipping up all that extra sauce.  When our 4th person finally showed up, we decided we needed more meatballs and our server asked if we'd like the order to include an extra meatball.  I love when servers just 'get it' and ours was exceptional the entire night.

We also had an order of the broccolini, and several bites of the daily pintxo (pronounced pincho).  All excellent.

For our pizza, our server recommended the Pesto pizza (normally vegetarian) and suggested we add proscuitto to it.  This is going to be my new go-to pizza there.  All the flavors just worked so well together.

I wish we would have had room to try out more of their fantastic menu, but by this point we were full from both fantastic food and wine.

Whether for a dinner with friends, a date, or a lunch with co-workers, this is a great spot that's consistently excellent in food, wine, and service - a rarity in the Calgary dining scene."}
{"text":"Superior professional service. Great pizza and food (go family style and order a big salad, 2 pizzas and 2 bottles for four - plenty of food for 4). Pricey. Worth it. Go. Seriously."}
{"text":"Una is great. The food is good, the service is good and prices are decent. I didn't like the fact that they said they would charge for tap water on the menu, but when our bill came it wasn't included.

This is a great spot for a casual date. They don't take reservations so you might have to wait a bit to get a table but it's well worth the wait. Make sure to try out Persian dates appetizer. It's to die for."}
{"text":"2-stars.  I can't help but wonder why Una Pizza + Wine is always so busy...  Oh yes, this is Calgary where most people don't realize a $20 12-inch pizza and $8 glass of \"house\" wine is highway robbery.  Maybe on occasion I will spend $15 on some kale, panko, a boiled egg, deli meat and cheese because I'm a man and quite frankly I hate making salads :)  However, paying ($15-$21) for a dry, thin crust pizza that is lacking in flavour and ingredients is right above getting my scrotum waxed on my priorities list.

Una doesn't take reservations.  Why not you ask?  Well because they don't really need to.  There are plenty of suckers walking along 17th ave at all hours day and night, so there!  I was coaxed into going here one day.  There were two of us so we were seated in the only available non-hour-long-wait space; the \"chef's counter\" aka, in front of the sweltering hot oven.  The air quality in the restaurant isn't the best to start off with and sitting in front of the hot oven made it worse.  However, we didn't feel like waiting an hour (BTW we walked right in).  The smell of baked dough is good at first but then you end up wanting to go outside after a few minutes to the carbon monoxide fest on 17th ave for some fresh air.  I'm a pineapple-in-my-pizza kind of guy so I ordered the \"tiki\" ($17); my friend ordered the mushroom ($20).  I ordered a glass of the house white ($8) as well.  I'm not a wine connoisseur so I won't comment on how good or bad it was.  All I can say is that I couldn't \"tell the difference\" so they could've been serving a $10 bottle of something or a $40 bottle of something and I wouldn't be any of the wiser.  I have a feeling it's not the latter.

Our pizza came out in a short while (10-15min.).  They have a fancy tray device where you can put one tray on top of another at the same table, a smart idea!  The tiki pineapple was sliced paper thin so it became really dry and hard to taste.  The sauce was mediocre and the crust was dry.  The mushroom was only slightly better ($3 better perhaps?).  It came out with arugula and supposedly tuffle oil; I couldn't taste it.  I only had 3 slices but I felt really bloated after eating there.

Ok, on to the good thing (singular):

Una's service is great (4-stars here, hence 2-stars overall).  Everyone is polite.  The service staff and the host staff are amazing and they run the place like a well oiled machine.

Una is part of the BMeX group of restaurants (see my Native Tongues Taqueria review) and I'm starting to see a trend with them.  They like to hire young, hip staff, design a visually stunning dining area and then deliver a mediocre product.

I'm not returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"We came here during dinner time and although it seemed pretty packed, we got a table immediately. The thing is, it's such a narrow small space. They probably could.make the take out smaller next door, and make the actual restaurant bigger. Our table was a bit cramped in a corner next to what I think is their screen system. Workers were coming right next to our table all night and the table was a bit small with our food and drinks on it. 
The food was really good, my boyfriend and I shared a pizza and it was if enough to fill both of us. If we each ordered one it would've been way too much food and I don't think we would've had enough room on our table!
They also don't carry regular pop products and have fancy water. They have artisanal sodas, which were very good, although if you're craving a coke to go with your pizza, it doesn't hit the same spot. The water is specially filtered and costs for you to have some, but they have tap water if you don't want to pay for it. 
All in all it was just a mediocre experience, I can't say it was the best food, and it doesn't outweigh how small and odd our table/experience was."}
{"text":"Chilli oil, yes.

Truffle honey, yes. 

Any pizza, in my mouth now. 

Peach cheesecake in a jar, magical. 

You can never go wrong at Una. Great service. Fantastic bar and drink selections. Best tasting pizza I've ever had. I eat until I want to puke. And then I eat more."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious pizzas!!... Now, I know why is always soooo busy!!.. It takes me a while trying it as every time I went there I saw the line, and I didn't want to wait.. But now, I understand the reason... The wine is very good, and the pizzas delicious!.. Best crusty I have had in Calgary.. It is like the pizzas in the northeast of the USA.. I recommend this place 100%"}
{"text":"It was good to go on Thanksgiving eve, because there was not a wait for a table on a Sunday night.  

The octopus appetizer was a large tentacle of octopus.  It looked better than it tasted.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't interesting. 

One pizza was prosciutto and arugula, which appeared to be quite popular based on what all the other tables ordered.  Not sure why - it was boring.  If they offer the chili oil, take it.  That is great and adds the zing lacking in the pizza. The pepperoni was better, with more flavor.  The crusts were cooked well,but lacked flavor - salt and herbs would have helped.  The wine list was its best feature."}
{"text":"UNA is a refreshingly energetic sit-down restaurant and unlike most pizza restaurants you'd come across.

You notice immediately when walking through the door that the place is buzzing. I've been many times now, and even when there's no room they are really friendly and happy to pour some wine while you wait.

The wine list is great, the appetizers are good (though not all of them are perfect), and the pizzas are fantastic. My favorite pizzas so far are the prosciutto and mushroom pizzas.

This is a great choice for a social evening out with friends and coworkers. They get almost everything right here, so there's very little to complain about. Currently one of my favorite places in Calgary, and a place I find myself craving when back in Vancouver!"}
{"text":"Trendy place with designer-style Neapolitan pizza. Crust is excellent if you like light and airy. Very good selection of wines as well. You can tell the chef puts a lot of care into the design of menu items."}
{"text":"Got to kill a few more restaurants off my Calgary bookmarks this weekend and UNA was at the top of the list. I've heard lots of great things and I wasn't let down.

For a Sunday night the place was packed. When I arrived around 7pm there wasn't a table to be found and only a couple spots at the bar. Believe what the other reviewers say about having to wait a while for a table.

My dining companion was under the weather so I ended up eating alone. But this worked out well in the end. I ended up sitting at the bar right in front of the counter where the food sits to go out to the tables. I probably saw the entire menu go right by me during my visit. Everything looked delicious and made it a little harder to make my decision on what to order.

First up I needed a beer to go with my dinner. They have Wild Rose on tap which is great as I like to get my fill of WR and Big Rock when I'm in town. Unfortunately their taps were out of order. The waiter quickly made the suggestion to try Alhambra, a Spanish beer. It was an excellent substitution, so excellent I had two!

For dinner I went with the prosciutto pizza. The toppings were very simple and cooked to perfection. The prosciutto was just starting to get crispy on the edges but still tender. The handful of fresh arugula they throw on top of the pizza was an interesting twist and added a welcoming flavour to the pie.

As I enjoyed my dinner I saw a few desserts go by. One I particular caught my eye. After perusing the dessert menu I found out it was the sticky toffee pudding, one of my favourite desserts. The cake was extremely moist and had a nice crispy edge. For $9 it was a healthy size portion. I would recommend sharing this one.

My waiter was great, making sure I had everything I needed and adding some idle chit-chat, asking how I was enjoying everything and what I thought.

I left stuffed and happy, just the way any restaurant should make you feel."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza options, Italian-style salads, and homemade ricotta cheese! My family loved the prosciutto pizza, and I loved the margherita pizza with gluten free crust ($3.50 extra) and truffle oil added (for $3 extra). We also loved the chopped salad and ricotta with fig, prosciutto, and balsamic (comes with bread, or gluten free brioche for extra). 

Next time I'm back in town, I will definitely revisit this place! I'd also like to try their sister restaurants (especially Native Tongues)."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the city, hands down. If you haven't tried it, you are missing out on something absolutely wonderful!"}
{"text":"Love it!!!! a long wait to get in but what a classy interior and delicious pizza!! Almost couldn't find it the first time I went their: Literally a hidden gem!e"}
{"text":"Why 3stars? I will tell you.  First: the atmosphere is hot and overcrowded.  No air conditioning in the summer so prepare to swelter.  Second: They installed a super-duper filtration system for their water and they want you to pay for it.  It's $2 for special filtered water, but if you refuse, then you are punished with lukewarm tap water, no ice.  Third: to crown your dining experience off,  you will be served an absolutely flavorless pizza.  But hey it's for a good cause. They supposedly give a pizza for everyone purchased. Has anyone looked into this claim? Just asking"}
{"text":"One of the reasons I love venturing out to new eats are trying places like Una which is numero una in my books (that doesn't make sense but you get the gist!)

This place is crazy busy on a Friday night so expect to wait an hour before getting a table which isn't so bad when they offer drinks in the waiting area and you have two pals such as Kenny M. and Dan D. to shoot the breeze with to pass some time.  Oh and Thai Thai is right next door if you want to wet your beaks before din din.

One appey I highly recommend is the Salt Cod Brandade!  Dip anything in it and your sufficiently satisfied until the main course.  The $2 morsels of white anchovy tapas are also a treat that leaves you in anticipation of what could be next!

On top of that, the pizza's we ordered were deeeelish!  I love how their simplicity emphasizes the quality ingredients being used.  From the Margherita with its refreshing san marzano tomato sauce to the Bianca's creamy buffalo mozzarella, these scrumptious pies were definitely deserving of their gorgeous names.  Not too mention the honey truffle sweetness of the Potato.  The name may not have been as graceful, but it tangoed with our taste buds just the same.

All I remember about the interior of this place is that it was a small and cramped but that added to its charm. With good tunes to boot. Definitely a fun atmosphere especially after some Sir Perry's cider teehee.

Very anxious to hit UNA up again, you down?!

Adios Yelperinos!"}
{"text":"11/10 would recommend visiting, like right now. UNA is good enough to drop everything your doing in order to get there RIGHT NOW. 

You will probably have to wait for a table, but it's well worth the wait. The atmosphere is fun, funky, intimate, and sets the tone really well. They have a good selection of wine, and I love that they use high quality ingredients in all their dishes. The service is friendly and laid back, but never lazy. 

Their pizzas are each very unique and I would recommend trying a few different ones, although it's hard not to pick a favorite and get the same one over and over. If you're looking to start with something that's not in the pizza zone the Kale Caesar Salad is a must try. 

I compare every single gourmet pizza place I visit to UNA, and I have yet to find one I love quite as much (despite hitting specialty pizza places in multiple different cities)."}
{"text":"Service is Fast but server is not friendly enough so I might just go for takeaway the next time. I love the pizza. My girl oredered the 4-maggi. it was plain with cheese and honey sause on top so it's still flavorful even without meat and such. I also had the calamari that looked like a squid version of a sardines. It's not crispy as expected but still good. I had a happy tummy after. Pizza is baked fresh too so it's yummy!"}
{"text":"Good for these guys......to take on the wicked wedge space on 17th would be tough.

Simple elegant space and you can see its about the food experience....we just grabbed our first take out pizzas and it was pretty tasty.

Get out and support them. Calgary needs more unpretentious spots to stop and chat and eat...."}
{"text":"This place is tiny and needs to expand for how busy they are. The prosciutto and the tiki pizza are my go-tos. Tried the seared octopus and it was different than what I was expecting but still a great dish. We sat up at the bar in front of where they make the pizzas. Very clean kitchen, cooks looked like they were enjoying their jobs and interacted with us which made being crammed against the bar much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Hands down my very favourite restaurant. I'm an introvert but I don't even mind the noise and closeness of tables. I love sitting at the bar and watching the bar and kitchen. Great food, knowledgeable staff, fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie when I say the first time I tried this place, I didn't like it and I didn't understand what the hype was about. It just goes to show that first impressions aren't always everything! 

First time I went here my boyfriend and I got the mushroom pizza to share and I believe we got some sort of seared steak as a starter. While they definitely don't skimp on the toppings, I felt it was a little plain for me as I remember only being able to taste mushrooms and pizza crust. I definitely wasn't blown away as I expected to be. Our steak was really undercooked, but we didn't overly mind because it was delicious and reminded me more of beef tataki. Unfortunately both of us got sick that evening and we felt it was because of the steak. Also, I have a huge pet peeve of this filtered \"Q\" water and hate being charged for it ($2/person). I personally cannot taste the difference so I would've asked for tap water if I knew I was going to be charged. My first experience wasn't the best, I was disappointed cause I had high hopes so I didn't bother to return. 

One night I had a friend visiting from out of town and it was pretty late on a weekday night and the only thing I'll give this place credit for is that late night hours all throughout the week. I was willing to give this place another go and we headed down there and because she was vegetarian, we had some limited options. In the end we decided on the 4-maggi and the kale Caesar salad. Now THIS is the experience I believe was supposed to be the first. The 4-maggi is unbelievably good! I was a little apprehensive of the honey being on top, but I cannot tell you how it complements the cheese SO well. Fair warning, if you're the type of person that expects a dish to taste a specific way (ex. cheese pizza tasting like your standard American cheese pizza), I have a feeling it might taste a little strange for you (unless you have adventurous taste buds), but honestly don't knock it till you try it. 

I have to jump on the kale ceaser salad boat and add that it is really good! It's a big salad so if you want room for pizza, I do recommend you share it with someone. And plus you don't feel as bad eating pizza next because you're eating kale like the adult you are. 

The atmosphere is awesome and very lively, even if you go fairly late into the evening like I usually have. While I wouldn't say it would be my first pick for a normal time dinner, I would say it's definitely up there for a late night bite to eat on a weekday."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best veal meat balls on the planet, I'm coming back here every time I go to calgary.  Love you guys."}
{"text":"Great quality food, upbeat setting and friendly staff. Just a wonderful place. My favorite is the sauteed prawns with lemon, garlic, flambéed with sambuca. What an amazing dish from their tapas menu, which they categorized as \"bar.\" The taste just explodes in your mouth.  The tomato arugula salad was unbelievably refreshing.  It was a soul dish... the dish was marked by the freshness of the ingredients.  I also loved how creative the place is - an audiobook is played in the washrooms instead of music. Hilarious. They made it to my list of restaurants I would come back to again and again."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! I ordered the mushroom pizza and meatballs to start. The mushroom pizza was delicious, but I only wished the crust wasn't so thick. The meatballs were just ok; they were a bit under seasoned. I'd pass on the meatballs next time and try the scallops instead. 

Would definitely return."}
{"text":"UNA is just okay. I only ever go there at the request of others. I'm not really sure why people love it so much- the food is good but nothing I have ordered here has stood out to me or wow'd me. The atmosphere is cute but it's always really busy and noisy. The service is consistently good though!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is so delicious! My husband and I try to head there on our anniversary every year. We haven't been with our toddler, so I'm not sure how well they deal with small children. The thing I like best about this restaurant is how they take names down for waiting. Since they're on the Red Mile, they allow you to head out for a cocktail and will phone you when your table is ready. This is the best concept I have ever come across because they allow for your evening to be fun from the start and not force you to wait in the cold or in their small entryway."}
{"text":"Very busy environment! Go early! On a weekday got there for 5:4pm and got the last available table, after that it was long line ups. 

Ordered the prosciutto pizza. Pizza wise it was pretty good, thin crust but crust wasn't crispy but more on the chewy side. Nice flavor but for personal taste the combination of prosciutto and provolone piccante made it on the salty side. But that was my personal taste."}
{"text":"I only give 5 Stars on the occasion I am exceptionally impressed with something. Not to say I am not impressed in a 4 star review... but well you know sometimes there is a difference.

So I discovered UNA because my wife found it and brought me there for my birthday dinner on Sunday. She also knows I have a special SPECIAL love for gourmet pizza, Italian tomatoes, red wine, and high quality sourced ingredients. 

And, what did we get? GOURMET FRICKEN AWESOME PIZZA. The first words that left my mouth after the first bite was: \"Wow, that was something special.\"

It's not just the food that add up to a 5 Star review - it was the service, the knowledge about the menu items, and the incredible knowledge about the ingredients and where they came from. 

Overall, it was a personable experience and we both felt very comfortable like we were \"part of the family\" as it were. Great staff, great culinary skills, and impressive ingredients go well together. 

We highly recommend it.

Thanks UNA! We will be seeing you again. 

Sincerely,
Shane"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite neopolitan style pizza places in Calgary, if I can get in. Unfortunately, they do not take reservations and have a very small restaurant with limited seating space. They will take your name and phone number to give you a call when a table is available for your party size. Unfortunately, there's not a lot to do on 17th near Una. The food is definitely worth the wait, though. 

In regards to the ambiance, it is a (as I mentioned) a fairly small and tightly filled space. They do not have a patio space and there is only street parking (which can be hard to find in this neighborhood). However, inside, the restaurant is quite cozy and well decorated. It has a bit of a rustic charm to it, especially when infused with the smell of fresh pizza! 

The service is usually amazing; I've really never had any issues before, but a friend of mine has complained that she didn't have water refilled for over an hour, even after waiving down someone to remind them. That being said, my own experiences have been nothing but positive. Staff are usually well versed on their menus and can offer a lot of suggestions for food and drinks. They have also been quite attentive. 

In terms of food, Una is definitely one of the best pizza places in Calgary for a reason. They make their dough fresh in house, use only the best (and local) ingredients, and make combinations that you wouldn't expect to go well together to taste truly amazing. Their classics are also so delicious - far better than what you'd expect given that some only have 2 or 3 ingredients. They also do an excellent job on a lot of their pastas and other dishes, so it's not just pizza folks! 

In particular, notable dishes include their Mushroom pizza, Proscuitto pizza, Risotto (right now it is summer squash), and seared scallops. MMmmm... They also have an excellent wine selection that their staff are quite familiar with."}
{"text":"It wouldn't be often that a place where you end up waiting an hour and 15 minutes to get a table gets a solid four stars ... but UNA deserves it!

The pizza is great. Simple, clean flavours.
Had both the Bianca (buffalo mozza, basil puree, EVOO) and the Margherita. Both were excellent in their simplicity although the Margherita could have maybe used a bit more cheese.

Had the Potato pizza as well (potatoes, provalone piccante and truffled honey). The flavours were spot on, although somewhat too \"potatoey.\" I think if the potatoes were slightly thinner, it would be a much better balance. The potato was just too prominent over the other ingredients.

Also had the Salt Cod Brandade and the Patatas Bravas ... both were greater starters/sides and good value!

If you can weave through the packed \"graphic-t-wearing,\" \"smart-glasses\" crowd, the atmosphere is quite romantic and fun. 
I will definitely be back here on a date! :)"}
{"text":"Where else except Calgary can you get exceptional desserts at a pizza place. Fantastic key lime pie with thick graham cracker crust. Better than the Cactus Club which is tough to beat. The Churro pie and budino were above average. We never ordered any pizza. Maybe next time. We highly recommend UNA for desserts. Bootcamp Breakfast Club (BBC)."}
{"text":"Love the pizza !! The kale Caesar is THE BEST !!! I love the bar seating. All of the bartenders give such great service. One of my favorite lunch spots in Calgary."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The staff are all super friendly and the service is quick. Everything on the menu is amazing - seriously, don't worry about choosing the wrong thing because it's all delicious!! My fave is the zucchini - it's a great starter and a little unexpected. Affordable, not pretentious, amazing food!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic place, this thin crust Delight is a true to form representation of Italian pizzerias. With a fantastic wine selection awesome bar staff and incredibly fresh Vibe when a pizza is good for a quick lunch or an after work meal that can't be beat."}
{"text":"Must try pizza in the city. Tried few others that were supposed to be \"best in town\" before ending up here and I loved it!
Had the veggie pizza with House red wine and they went well together! Great service. They have a cute patio. There is some work being done on the streets so not much of a view from there."}
