{"text":"Ate at this location last evening with my partner. We have been dying to try it since it opened, but we should have stayed away. The fries were OK, but the burger was a weird color and looked like a typical frozen meat patty. If I am going to spend $ 9.00+ bucks for a burger and fries combo I would have been much happier eating a McDonald's Angus burger. At least McDonald's has some flavor!! 

The lady behind the counter (I think eastern European) acted as if she was bothered and too cool to take our order. She put like two ice cubes in our soda cups and the soda machine was out of Coca Cola. The place was not very busy at all, so I do not understand why the floor was so filthy. 

We will absolutely never eat here again."}
{"text":"Service is great !!  Maybe the burger is not 100% , but go blame hero burger head quarter . The store owner is doing great enough. About the busyness and store size ?! Please .. You are at downtown core , what do you want . The four star is to owner and servers. The missing one star is for hero burger head quarter ."}
{"text":"Worst customer service... If I could have gicen a half star, I would have.

Meet the gf, grab some \"delicious\" take out from the generally expensive Hero Burger, to treat ourselves at the end of the week.

Great in store service, however the suggested Ancho Chipotle Mayo (which I tipped for Carlos C having suggested). Head home (to the East end) for dinner.

Poutine, delicious. First bite of my burger, SOGGY bun and overcooked dry beef. No Sauce, what So Ever.

Called Mr. Carlos C... Unless I wanted to bring my burger back, no restitution was made for this idiotic mistake. 

THIS is why fast food workers DO NOT deserve $15/hr. They dont do their jobs correctly and offer no corrective measures. Id rather go tocDonalds for THIS bullshit."}
{"text":"Hm, I don't know what everyone is complaining about, this place is great! A little expensive but they claim their food is natural so I'm willing to pay a little more for healthier cows (or fish...)

I always get the salmon burger on a wheat bun which is delicious. I've honestly never had a burger here, but everyone I've gone with has loved them. I've never had a problem with the service before, but the place is a little messy. What do you expect though? It's a busy burger place on the corner of Church and Wellesley! I would for sure give this place a try, especially if you like a good salmon burger. 

They also have a veggie burger and healthier options like whole wheat buns and sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Not coming back. Service was efficient enough, my order was technically correct and came up in good time, but the food was all around blah. Bun was dry, burger patty was completely without flavour and weirdly firm for \"beef\". Apparently getting mustard on your burger means \"drown it\". Poutine was equally bland - lots of cheese, which is a good thing, but doesn't make up for soft, undercooked fries and gravy that tastes like nothing. 

Also - bathrooms. Wow. The location is such that I bet they get a lot of challenging visitors, but the toilet and floor were literally covered in piss and on a quiet night with only 1?2? staff on, it's understandable that they aren't doing frequent washroom checks - but gross. I hope the staff who are actually making the food having access to cleaner bathrooms."}
{"text":"It's so nice to have another place for late-night eating in the village!  The burgers here are delicious, but the sides are a let-down: the onion rings were tasteless and the fries were soggy.  Still, I'll probably go back--it definitely beats pizza at the end of the night."}
{"text":"I got a burger and fries here. As an American, I think I'm qualified to judge the quality of burgers. I was also a little intoxicated, so my standard for good burgers was lower than usual. This burger was nasty. Patty was clear pre-frozen or precooked, and lacked any and all flavor. Blue cheese was clearly artificial and overpowering in flavor. Bacon was tasteless. Bun was dry and flavorless. Fries were greasy, flaccid, and under-salted. No soap in bathroom. This burger confirmed all my preconceived notions of Canada: a lower quality ripoff of American culture. Shame on this restaurant and Canada."}
{"text":"Asked for a salmon burger, poppy seed bun with mayo and lettuce, pickle. Got a hard ass i dont even know what kind of bun that was, NO SAUCE, two pieces of pickles and literally ONE PIECE OF LETTUCE. Salmon was not seasoned at all, whole burger was dry as bloody hell, no sauce no flavour whatsoever. Also ordered sweet potato fries with the burger, got a cup HALF filled with fries and the fries tasted withered, soft and chewy EWWWWWWWW. The most terrible burger ive had in my whole life. I mean, is it really THAT HARD to make a freaking burger?...additionally, the asian lady who took my order was quite rude too. (actually, REALLY FKIN RUDE but yeah im not gonna expand on this for now) definitely not going back ever again."}
{"text":"I've been to the location on Yonge Street closer to Adelaide and that particular location is much better. 

I stopped in here after a few drinks and ordered a 4oz burger + a poutine. Luckily I was the first in line, so only had to wait between 7-10 minutes for my order. I wasn't sure what the available toppings were for the burger and asked the girl behind the counter and she sort of used her shoulder to point 'look behind me'. A much better cashier would have turned around and pointed where I should look or actually told me my options. I do give her kudos for smiling and telling me to have a nice night after giving me my order when it was ready. 

In terms of fast food, McDonalds, Burger King, and Wendy's much better tasting options for a clogging artery meal. 

My burger from here was plain soggy and just tasted horrid. The best I can describe this is, what I would think a frozen meat patty soaked in water and then boiled would taste like. The bun though, nice and soft.

Poutine - seriously? I could tell the fries were not cooked. They were raw! Ew. Double ew. They probably should invest in a fry timer like McDonalds uses to make sure the fries are cooked and still not frozen.

Meal was about $11.00. 

$11.00 of my money that I wasted. 

Go elsewhere, and seriously if you're desperate for a meal, there's a hot dog vendor across the street. Or better yet, go home and cook yourself a meal!"}
{"text":"never disappointed I used to frequent this daily when I worked at Steamworks and the people here are extra friendly."}
{"text":"One of the worst burgers that I have ever eaten. The meat was dry and the bun stale; fries were lackluster. It was expenseve and the staff certainly could not have cared less about customers. Clearly it is a place to be avoided."}
{"text":"Three stars for the burgers, five stars for the poutine. The mushroom poutine had tons of fungi atop the curds, gravy, and fries, all tasting delicious together. Each ~$6 order is a good portion for one person, especially when paired with a smaller burger that was notably average in quality. Friendly staff that dealt well with our large, boisterous group."}
{"text":"Got delivery via Uber eats.
Food was cold three times in a row.
Won't happen again."}
{"text":"What use to be a great little spot has turned ugly including the help that waited on me tonight. I waited and waited and waited in line to be served. The place was full of crack heads shouting. The fat chick behind the counter was busy chatting with the customer ahead of me with no regard to the fact that I am waiting and this is suppose to be fast food. Finally the guy moved on and I stated my order, her reply \"you are going to have to wait a few moments\" , my reply \"I already have waited a few minutes\" she looked at me and walked away. I can only assume business is so good they don't need to worry about customer care or business is so bad it doesn't really matter any more. I suspect the latter. A few minutes later she came back and said \"ok, now I will take your order\" like she is doing me a favour. I said \"never mind thank you\" and proceed to leave. Her comment \"it doesn't matter\". And that is exactly the point, I should matter. They chased me out with bad service and the crack heads were allowed to stay. The Village should be a destination meaning that people come down their to have a good time and should be treated with appreciation and respect or they won't be back and have you noticed, they are not coming back. As an establishment in the village you should great customers knowing that they made their way down and as owners of business you should make sure the customer leaves with a positive experience or the village won't be a destination much longer. This isn't happening and the village is dying a rapid death. The hamburger joint was loaded with crack heads and they were getting more attention than me. All I can say to this owner and others in the area is if you don't respect that people come down to visit the village and looking for a nice interaction than crack heads is what you are going to get. As for the fat chick behind the counter, that's why you are working there, no one else would have you. You don't matter. Anyone thinking of grabbing a quick bite, jump into your car and head north, you won't find anything good here. This is the type of place that would die for a Yelp event, they are that desperate."}
{"text":"Not a good burger for vegetarians as they do not have a separate grill. I made the mistake of ordering one before asking and it tasted of beef. Eeeew.

Aside from that, it's great burger joint food. The onion rings are battered, not breaded, and keep me coming back. Actually, I make my own veggie burger at home and get an order of the 'rings for take out. I had their milkshake when I was sick (I decided it was the only thing that could possibly help my sore throat) and it was really good! OK, so it was the first milkshake I've had in probably 15 years... but it sure hit the spot!

I love their packaging. All of their food is wrapped in a practical and useful way which is a nice surprise and actually makes consumption easy. It's too bad they don't have a veg-friendly grill."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Stay away from this location. I just waited 40 minutes for a burger and onion rings. I see people coming in and coming out with their orders and I'm still waiting. So I ask the cashiers if my order is coming and they look behind and say 'yes'. I'm waiting and waiting and I see people coming in and out and getting their order. After 40 minutes I gave up and asked for my money back. Then my order came and I asked to wrap it to go as I couldn't eat it there anymore. Will definitely not step foot in this establishment again. I used to be a regular customer. I recommend to everyone to stay away from this place. Worst service in the world!!!"}
{"text":"I tried the Turkey Cranberry burger.. sooooo good!! My new fave!"}
{"text":"Service here is just awful.  Been there twice, they messed up my order twice.  Staff in general is really unhelpful.  The food is mediocre, doesn't do enough to make up for the service.

If you do brave it, check your order before you chow down.  Also, check before you leave if you get takeout."}
{"text":"I was there last week on Friday night and was unimpressed.  The place was packed (new place guess everyone was checking it out).  The place has limited seating and with the crowd you kind of feel rushed to eat.  The burger was kind of gross.  It tasted a bit fatty.  The burgers come in three sizes so I got the middle one.  Kind of expensive for what I got.  I'd hate to get the smallest size as it would be nothing.  Place is not made for kids (nothing for them to do) don't even think they had a kids menu.  The fries were pretty plain too. I'm not a big salt guy but they could have used a bit more.  Don't think I'll be rushing back there again soon.   The place is no Licks!"}
{"text":"Dear Hero Burger,

When I was a young lad, 
you were my burger of choice, 
But I've grown up and so have you,
unfortunately I cannot rejoice.  

Burgers of average quality,
for such sky high prices,
makes my wallet feel guilty,
as my mind and soul is not really enticed. 

Why you gotta play me like dat Hero?

Seriously, it costs about $14 for a normal sized combo, the fries are average and the burger is nothing special. I'd much rather go to Harvey's or Lick's.   Also, during lunch time, this place can get busy and really you end up sitting on stool cramped next to some stranger.  Not my type of place."}
{"text":"I saw the other Yelper's review, from America, and as another American I think I'm qualified to rate burgers even though I wasn't at all intoxicated as the other patron states.
Got a veggie burger with lots of fixin's- mayo, ketchup, lettuce, tomato, it was awesome and the fries were steaming hot and good, not greasy :)"}
{"text":"Best place for a burger ever- no matter drunk or sober.

Not to mention the staff is wonderful. The one lady who works there knows my name (sad times) and because of that, I will only go there.

I *heart* Hero Burger"}
{"text":"I'm giving it 4 stars mostly because of the service. Everyone here is super nice, even at 3am.

The staff are quick, and the place is still pretty clean.

I'm not a fan of hero burgers, but at 3am they're greasily delicious.

I always tend to go overboard with the free toppings and sauces.

Calm down, and don't over do it, and you'll be able to actually eat your food."}
{"text":"Whyyyyyyyy did I wait so long to try this. I always saw the lines at the food court in Sherway Gardens but I'd always opt for my first love, McDonald's (I'm aware many people will think that's disgusting, but we have history).
So after a night at the Maddy, my biffle, myself and our boyfriends went into Hero Burger for some after-bar eats.
I loved the limitless condiments, different kinds of cheese, and delicious burgers.
I tried it again not after the bar and still loved it.
I can't wait to try the one in B-town. I hope it's just as good."}
{"text":"Nice ingredients (cheese, bacon, sauce, veggies, etc.), but that's it.

The patties need a recipe re-do. The burger patties tasted like sausage."}
{"text":"Good burgers cooked to order. Nice staff are helpful. It's a burger place though at the end of the day. You eat and leave. Like the other reviews say, it's sound but a little expensive."}
{"text":"When I end up anywhere near Church and Wellesley, I can't pass up Hero Burger!!! This location is a hot spot at night and can get pretty full, but they move quick and the food is always so fresh and delicious. Amazing, friendly staff too! Writing this just made me hungry.... lol"}
{"text":"I'm increasing my three star review to 4 stars simply because this place is consistent.  After three visits to this location I have never had a bad experience; they have never messed up my order and I've never had to wait an excessive amount of time to get my food."}
{"text":"I just finished my meal here after going to the raptors game. I was hungry, tired and wanted something quick and \"fresh\".
Their advertisements say they use fresh beef that's hormone free and pasture fed. Well, I'm not sure if it was the power of marketing that led me to believe that this may quite possibly be the juiciest burger I've eaten in awhile.
Although you can build your own burger up with their respective accoutrement, it can get pricey.
I stuck with one of their pre fix burgers, the egg burger. I got with fries and a drink.
The burger was juicy, the egg wasn't runny which is how I like it, but it was freshly fried and it worked. The bun was also delicious.
One of the previous reviewers said the fries were soggy - I can't understand how. The fries I ordered were crispy, not overly fried and all in all delicious.
I'll be back again - great burger"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0 I would. I have to say that I was completely disappointed by this place on so many levels. Maybe part of this was due to the fact that I was so much looking forward to its opening only to be completely let down. Anyway, the long and the short of it is that they do some things right here but the burger itself is garbage. It's very much a poor mans (but twice the price) 5-Guys !! At 5-Guys the burger itself as well as the toppings are exactly crafted to your  taste. Its a little bit more expensive of course but you get what you pay for. Unfortunately at Hero Burger you pay more than 5-Guys burgers but get much less of the experience.  What's nice about this place is that the bread roll is somewhat boutique and you can order gratis extra sides and condiments however, when push comes to shove it has to be said that the burger itself is complete garbage. Lets put it this way, imagine going to the grocery store and finding Bubba Burger in the frozen section in 3 sizes. Well that's basically what you have at this joint. They don't even give you the option of cooking the burger to your taste (rare, medium well done). The chain sells itself on \"100% angus burger\" but I think 100% leather would be closer to the truth. What's even worse is that you have to request ketchup from behind the counter. If you are half way though your meal and you need more they are too cheap to have a condiment dispenser. You basically have to get back in line and order it. But wait, there's more.......if you want ice in your soda you have to get back in line too. This is the 21st century folks not Eastern Europe. There is hardy any seating in this restaurant but then the place is so bad that I know know why I was able to have a table to my self this evening. The final knock on this place is that the people behind the counter have a very poor grasp of the English language. Toronto is a very multicultural city but I find it annoying when I have repeat myself 3 fold in order to simply place my order. Do not be fooled by the nice shiny exterior and the high prices, stay away from this place like the plague. Its overpriced and not worth it. Trust me when I say you will get a better burger for half the price at McDonalds."}
{"text":"I would rather eat McDonals then Hero Burger.....so bad!

I took a spin over to this place after a night of drinking, I was sober enough to know that what I needed was a burger and poutine to cure what ails me.  I had gone in a few days before to get a poutine, and ya it was ok, but not the greatest, this time I decided to grab a burger.  I have heard so much about them, and the place seems to always be full, that I figured I was in for a treat.  Well I was wrong!!!

The bun tasted like foam from one of those cheap pillows you get at good will from 1976 and the beef patty was like eating rubber.  It didn't even look like real beef!  The burger had WAY to much of their Hero sauce and the pillow bun was drenched in it and still tasted like foam!

I will admit that the staff is very friendly and nice.  They chatted with me while I waited for my food and we even joked.  I figure they know how bad the food is and they have to make up for it.  I hope that the reason the food was so horrid is just growing pains of the newest location.

Think twice before you hit up a Hero Burger...."}
{"text":"I was craving a poutine, and this place is around the corner from my place. The service was quick and efficient, and the staff ok - nothing memorable. My order was made in under 5 minutes and it was still warm when I got home. The poutine itself was ok, but again, nothing memorable. Personally I found that it had a bit too much gravy. But I guess for many that is not a bad thing. 

Skip."}
{"text":"Wasn't all that impressed with this location. Staff was ok but nothing special. The food was okay but a tad under cooked for my liking. Location had mostly a \"order and get out\" sort of vibe going on. 

 They would not let you use the bathroom unless you were a paying customer but I kind of understand that rule based on the location."}
{"text":"I find Hero Burger a reasonable option for a quick dinner for my entire family - Mister Vegetarian, all the kids, and any guests or visitors - in part because they produce the food quickly and there are a bunch of options. The food isn't fantastic but it's solid, and the zucchini tempura is a household favorite (and they'll give you a side of chipotle mayo for them for free, upon request). The chicken burger is usually charred at the edges because it's not uniform and they cook everything to death, but I like it a little crispy so that's okay. 

My real complaint is that they always seem so /annoyed/ to have to deal with a big order, there. I go in and order six combos, and it seems like they'd rather I bugger off than drop $80 on burgers and poutine. A little friendliness wouldnt kill you, guys. 

Otherwise, though, it's a decent and reasonably quick dinner. Vegetables totally look and act like vegetables, and they will give you a side salad instead of fries for the asking. Also, the poutine gravy is vegetarian and so, therefore, is the regular poutine. Yum."}
{"text":"Told me the Wifi is\"private\": not for customers. Really? That's disappointing. -1

They now charge extra for a multigrain bun. It used to be free and IMO should be free.-1

Otherwise, good burgers and service. 3/5"}
{"text":"Had a really bad experience at Hero Burgers on Oct 17th 2017 at 1:00am.
i had a friend with me we were walking around the area and decided to give this place a try.

Got to the counter and ordered $30.00 with tax for 2 burgers and 2 poutine this place is not cheap, the cashier a little Filipino lady named Anabel who said nothing to us but what is your order in a growl....
No hello -no thank-no smile and looked just plain miserable I later found out she was the owner/ but cant be sure.She made my experience very uncomfortable especially after spending a whopping $30.00 dollars. Your in the service business Anabel so it wouldn't hurt to crack a smile say hello and thank you to your customers. My friend was from out of town was like...what the hell is up with her....

That being said I wont be back!"}
{"text":"If you are in the neighbrhood and hungry and this is you only option then its OK."}
{"text":"I took refuge here in the middle of Pride on Sunday afternoon.  Halfway through my volunteer stint and I needed fuel - there just wasn't anything I saw on the food trucks that tempted me.  I ducked into the sweet air conditioning and ordered a gluten-free veggie burger.

Sure, the washroom was out of order.  And yes, I was hungry and sandwiched in-between Toronto's Finest Police Force chowing down at the counter.  No ambiance.  But it didn't taste like sawdust.  In fact, it was pretty good.

I would eat it again, in fact.  They didn't skimp on the toppings.  Not especially inexpensive for 'fast' food, but with the GF and vegetarianism, I can't complain.  Next time I would spring for a combo.  I almost stole a fry from the cop next to me."}
{"text":"There's a new Hero Burger location that popped up around the Church and Wellesley area. It replaced the long resident Lettieri Espresso + Bar that occupied the spot for as long as I can remember.  Hero Burger is Lettieri's entrance to the burger market.  Angela and I decided to grab a quick lunch before heading off for a movie nearby.

The place isn't small, but isn't huge either. I guess I didn't really like the layout too much as there's a number of seats that are close to the door without any way of blocking the frigid winds as customers made their way in and out of the burger joint.  Because of this, we quickly decided to try and grab the warmest seats possible.

We decided to order something small as we weren't really hungry. We each got the 4oz Signature Burger combo, mine with onion rings and hers with fries. She got the fountain iced tea and I decided to mix mine up with Coke and Fresca. And not gonna lie, this combination didn't taste bad at all. A very nice pleasant surprise.

The food took about 10 mins or so to be ready for pickup. Her burger topped with lettuce, tomato, cheese and the hero sauce. I got mine topped with lettuce, tomato, pickles, red onions, cheese and hero sauce.  First bite?? Not impressed. I mean hero burger is a popular choice amongst a number of people I know. And if anyone's been to the location that's close to Eaton's Centre, it's quite packed normally.  I looked at Angela and took another bite, feelings unchanged. The burger patty felt like it's has been sitting for a while or just somehow it was blended with weird tasting meat or seasoning. It tasted like a healthy cafeteria type burger patty. Now I don't mind a \"healthy\" burger patty, but this wasn't good at all. Now the sides were better, the onion rings were fine and the fries, nothing horrible here. I would say about average for most burger joints.  The toppings were fresh, so I can't bad mouth that. So it really just came down to a bad patty.

Overall, I didn't like hero burger. To mess up or have a bad tasting patty is a bad selling point if you're a burger joint. Maybe it's a one off?  Will I try them again? ...... Sure I guess.  Maybe I'm too nice sometimes as a reviewer, but here's to second chances."}
{"text":"My friend lives right around the corner from this place and for all those years of walking by it, I never stopped in. After a night at a concert, we stopped in, the owner was working the counter and recognized my friend. He took our order and the food was great. It is actually a chain, well, I guess the guy owns a few throughout Toronto. The burgers are way way way better than BK or McDonald's any day. I did try the french fries but wish I would have tried the poutine."}
{"text":"This is a good burger joint. I love the burger (can't remember the name of it) that has the pineapple on it! So good. All burgers should be topped with pineapple. 

The staff that work here are incredibly awesome friendly. I only go here when I really crave a burger, and it's a better alternative to McDonalds. -- and don't even get me started on that coke machine! That this is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. I've seen it at other places now, but the first time I saw that glorious machine was at this Hero Burgers. I can have cherry coke from a coke dispenser; My life is now complete. 

I have yet to try their poutine.. I'm a bit of a poutine snob, so I think I will steer clear, but their fries are delicious! 

All around, a quick burger fix and a decent meal."}
{"text":"Don't waste your valuable money. Of all the bugger places in the area I find Hero Burger to be the worst. Why? It's not exactly the food it is everything around it. 

I find the service extremely slow and disengaged. Secondly, when you order you wait forever to receive your meal. Finally, the prices are exorbitant; save your money and pay your rent. 

I would go to McDonalds before ever going back to Hero Burger."}
