{"text":"We came here Sunday night for a birthday dinner and we were pleasantly surprised. 

We ordered the chef's choice plate: 10 different skewers, ranging from chicken wings to chicken liver. These were all delicious and well cooked. We also ordered the deep fried squid, which was by far, my favourite dish of the night. The squid was well cooked, the batter was nice and airy, and the flavor was spot on. 

The service was also friendly and efficient. The prices are very decent: 200$ for 6 people, including a pitcher of beer and 3 sakes. Everyone left satisfied. 

We really enjoyed our experience, however, a few things make it a 4 star, rather than 5:
- the porkbelly was disappointing. It was chewy and bland
- the Otto salad was good, but there was just too much dressing. I couldn't taste the egg or fish in it

Overall, it's a good restaurant, especially if you stick to the skewers."}
{"text":"One of few izakaya that is worth trying in Montreal indeed! I really do enjoy the vibe here whenever I visit. The staffs are friendly and the food here is very close to what you could taste in Japan. Moreover, considering other Japanese pubs have very overpriced menus, the price here is pretty reasonable. Definitely recommending this place!"}
{"text":"Not a very enjoyable first experience at Otto, service was bad and we ignored by 2 waitresses at the entrance before getting seated by the third waitress. Ok food, nothing out of the ordinary.

Order:
- Otto Chicken Set (8 brochettes)
- 2x Lamb
- Buta Bara
- Buta Burger
- Otto Gamjatang

Food:
Food was ok nothing special.
The skewers had a nice grill taste but were missing flavor.overall missing flavors. The lamb skewers had too much cumin on them.
The Otto gamjatang is a twist on the korean version but not as spicy, the pork however was very tender and flavorful. The bowl is pretty big and should be shared.
The buta burger bun was delicious! The piece of pork is rather small but this keeps the dish light and goes well with the other elements inside the bun.

Service:
Service was slow and inefficient. We waited at the door for 10 minutes trying to get the attention of the 3 waitresses working there. Two of them made eye contact and noticed the lineup but just ignored it and went back to running around. One of the waitresses even went through the lineup to serve food to the terrace but did not pay attention or ask try to seat the waiting customers. I do understand that we arrived at a busy time but the least someone can do is to address new customers. Once we were seated we were asked to move to another table to accommodate a bigger group of 6 which seem to know one of the waitress.

The place is fairly small (about 14 tables + terrace) and there were 3 waitresses working. Overall it doesn't seem like there's any organization on how the service is done. Most of the time they're all running left and right without really making the service more efficient.

Price: 
~15$ - About 2$ per skewers and below 10$ for the main dishes."}
{"text":"I like their dishes :) it's very authentic and the price is reasonable!!! Every time I go, they don't have mango sake, hopefully they will have it next time when I visit!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Prices per yakitori (grilled chicken skewers) were very reasonable (~$2 per skewer) and it was not deafeningly loud in there like imadake can be. The yakitori (ranging from the familiar -- like thigh and wing -- and the less familiar -- like heart and gizzard -- ) are somewhat the focus here. But don't ignore the other items that range in price from $5.5 (pork belly burger) and $7.5 (Japanese chicken curry) to $16 (salmon sashimi okayodon) as portions were more generous than I would have thought and is likely enough food for the average diner. The variety on the menu means picky eaters and adventurous eaters, famished and slightly-peckish will all be able to find something.

Unfortunately they are not open for lunch, but they stay open later for dinner (12am or later, even on Sunday and weeknights). The price point and hours were perfect for us after we got out of a concert/show at place des arts and one of us was famished (hubby) and the other just wanted a little snack (me). Service was very fast, friendly, and polite. Looking forward to going back to try some more items! 

The place also takes interac (I didn't check if they take credit cards)."}
{"text":"Love this place, great for late night eats. It's often filled with industry (restaurant) workers who just finished work, as it's open late and has a relaxed whisky bar vibe. The staff and chef are really friendly. 

We ordered chicken wings, dumplings, kim chi, short ribs, and of course the skewers. Chicken, pork and chicken neck.
I really loved the sauce on the dumplings and the filling was really flavorful. The wings had no sauce but they were so perfectly crispy and seasoned on their own, there was no need to embellish. The kim chi and ribs were on point and the meat on the skewers were unbelievably juicy and tender. As for the chicken neck, I do not fancy cartilage but at 80 cents, it was worth a try and it was surprisingly good!

I would honestly be here every night if I didn't have such an affinity for having to always eat somewhere new but I am definitely a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Best steamed egg. Short ribs and fried octopus are good too. Yummy chicken soups. Reasonable price."}
{"text":"Our first time here and cannot wait to come back for more. Food is delicious and the vibe is super cozy and chill. Staff is helpful and work fast. Short rib is a must have!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. They're open hella late and the food is great. It's a good place to go with a big group or just with another person. I've tried the skewers, ebi gyoza, spicy pork bone soup, bibimbap and would order all of it again. My favourite is their pudding, it's homemade and super delicious though if you're not into a heavy egg flavour, you shouldn't get it"}
{"text":"For a spot specialized in yakitori I expected much more compelling grilled meat. At 2-3$ a pop, each skewer features a tiny amount of meat in some depressingly generic soy based seasoning. The chicken brown meat was good but let's be honest, even the worst cooks can't screw that up. On top of that: clunky service, mushy rice, incredibly hard to chew beef tongue and dry lamb meat.

I was tempted to try many more menu items with a second order round but after realizing the first 30$ spent gave us no satisfaction we decided to bounce."}
{"text":"It's so good. The most memorable plates were the Japanese Chicken Curry and the Pork Belly Skewers.

A friend of ours couldn't each much on the menu but we still managed to find some things he could eat (seared beef, grilled tomatoes.

We finished things off with the homemade ice cream (the strawberry and the toasted matcha were bombs).

The bill was just under $120 for 3.

Looking forward to going back with my girlfriend: it will be like being back to Tokyo it's that good.

Dope. 10/10. Marusan approves. Hào too.

Edit: Just went back for the second time today. Still amazing. 65$ for 2 (tax & tip included)"}
{"text":"Montreal is going through a Japanese  craze - in less than a year, plenty of Japanese joints have been popping everywhere and I'm not complaining. What distinguishes this one, is that this is a Yakitori, think of a Japanese grill restaurant cooking with charcoal. 

As soon as you step in, there's a retro feel and look with wood and brick walls. This reminded me of a Japanese pub. Kudos on the decoration.

Let me just start with saying that among our group of three, two are cooks (so they know their food!) and general consensus was that it's GOOOOD!

To start, we had the Otto salad, it was good but nothing to rave about. We then had the bibimbap (very tasty - different than your typical Korean bibimbap but really worth it). Obviously, we had to had the skewers, it's their staple! We had the gizzards (my fiends love it - I like it but that's just me not being a fan of this type of meat), beef tongue (DELISHHHH) and bacon (it comes with an egg dressing and you dip the bacon in there before eating it - DECADENT). We also had the truffle kaarage (my only complaint was that there bit a little too big but really goood nonetheless with little balls of sweet potato and a hint of curry. Couldn't really taste the truffle though.) 

Overall, it's a great place to go to to try something new. We went on a Monday night and the place was half full - no reservations required. Service is good, prices are somewhat affordable and booze is cheap - what's not too like?"}
{"text":"The food was great! But it was very busy and packed so they gave us a small table good for 4 person but we were six and the waitress has a little attitude."}
{"text":"Amazing Amazing Amazing !! All the food is fresh and very different from all other Japanese places. A must try: fried chicken, otto binimbap, calamari !! The salads are super good as well."}
{"text":"I came to visit this place for dinner a few months ago due to a good friends' insistence that it was super delicious and so after months of hearing about it, I finally came with him and some friends to check it out. Situated humbly on St Mathieu on an upper floor, the restaurant is small but cozy. A quick glance at the menu reveals an interesting concept- you order as many small individual skewers of different types of meats that interest you and whatever sides you want (not AYCE by the way). There is lots of variety on the menu and so we tried many items including different beef items, chicken, pork etc and to be honest, it was all underwhelming. The flavors were mostly absent although the concept is pretty cool. Service was good and prices were ok but that's about it. Won't be back..."}
{"text":"2e visite :
Nous avons demandé le Buta Burger mais il n'était pas disponible. Le karubi qui est des côtes levées style Coréen était bon. Nous avons pris l'assiette mix de brochettes du chef qui était bonne et le gésier était bon cette fois ci. La pieuvre était bonne aussi. Le serveur a oublié notre demande de sauce piquante et avons dû lui redemander. Avec le nouveau règlement, il ne devrait plus avoir de fumeurs sur la terrasse, mais ils toléraient que les gens fument et avec la fenêtre ouverte, une invitée trouvait que ce n'était pas agréable. 

Somme toute, nous avons aimé la nourriture, mais ils doivent faire attention au détail niveau service. Je vous le recommande toujours fortement. La deuxieme fois qui était un 2e soir était par contre très bruyante, car une table jouait à un jeu d'alcool alors ca peut être moins propice à une sortie romantique."}
{"text":"Love that there is a variety of chicken parts you can choose. It comes in brochettes and perfect to drink with beers. Place is crowded which gives good vibes"}
{"text":"This place is a must try! I'm a pretty adventurous white dude willing to eat just about any cultural dishes but this place excites me every time. I highly suggest trying their pork bone soup it will honestly warm you up nicely in Montreal winters and the flavours are addictive. I would also suggest the fried squid and some of the skewers, my girlfriend and I are constant regulars!"}
{"text":"Five stars for this place!!!!

The cocktails are amazing!!!
Yakitori are amazing!!!

The curry is a little too salty. The beef tongue is a little too hard. My friend loved the rice ball and she even ordered a second one. Definitely will go again some time. The price is not very expensive.

One minor thing is the servers are not quite familiar with their jobs, but I think it might be due to the fact that the restaurant is new and everyone is still adapting."}
{"text":"Tried almost everything and it was all delicious. Make sure you get the spare ribs the fried octopus and the chicken scallop skewer for sure. I also had the lamb skewers edamame the vegetable skewer platter and my girlfriend had a vegetarian bibimbap and I would recommend all of it."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!
The quality of the food was very high, I ordered bunch of skewers and each one exceeded my expectation.
Servers were kind and nice although it was a busy time with a lot of customer.
Their food was really good with hot sake too!
The food was served relatively fast and delicious.
I went there for lunch as well and had curry with fried veggie, and it was really good and served quick.

I would definitely recommend people to go there for good food and drink."}
{"text":"Small adorable place, the service is a bit slow but it's worth it for those chickens, it's very tasty and not expensive at all. For the sake is more expensive then the other place and they have only a small bottle."}
{"text":"Though it might not be a norm yet (and plus this being a yakitori place), there weren't a lot of options for vegetarian people. There was only a bibimbap that could be remade into a vegetarian dish, even salads had chicken or fish in it (and would be boring if they were without meat due to the lack of flavours). Overall, the atmosphere was pretty nice but the servers were extremely busy and did not attend to us too well. When one of the drinks we ordered were sold out, the server just walked away right after saying so without suggesting any other drinks (they might've been new as servers though)! They didn't have a variety of options for beer, though it's an izakaya. They only had pitchers for Sapporo, while the other two were offered in either cans or bottles. The food came out fairly quickly, so that was really great. The bibimbap (made vegetarian) wasn't too flavourful and was in a really small portion. I believe the food menu lacks variety, but again, it's forgivable since they're an izakaya. Overall, I did not have an amazing experience."}
{"text":"I went with my mom and brother for Mother's Day yesterday!
I went based on Yelp reviews and recommendations. I also need to point out, normally, it seems that is it loud and rowdy, which really doesn't bother me because I enjoy the ambiance, but for Mother's day (7h30PM), we were lucky that it was quieter.
We ordered: 2x chicken skin (sounds weird, but sooooo crispy and delicious!)
                    2x Chicken heart (don't knock it till you try it, nice bouncy texture with nice flavour)
                    2x chicken gizzards (very similar to the hearts, just a little tougher)
                   1x lamb (personally, it was ok. too much cumin for my taste)
                   1x beef tongue (cooked med-rare and so delicious and beefy)
                   1x chicken liver (cooked med-rare and was soft and gamey)
                  - the fried squid is a MUST, best fried squid I've ever had!
                  - marinated beef ribs, I recommend this because it was so soft and tender!
                  - Japanese curry, I LOVE curry and this was so nice and tangy. Very different to Indian and Thai curries! This ones very homey and comforting.
                 - 2x Karaage (Japanese fried chicken) BEST fried chicken! so juicy it dripped when you took a bite! and the chicken was nicely seasoned.

Everything was delicious! Service was great! the 2 waiters that were there that night were super friendly. I don't think people understand how much of a HUGE difference it makes when you smile and just have a good vibe. It makes it SUCH an enjoyable dining experience.
We left with the \"after restaurant glow\" which happens when there was good food, good company, good service and a good time!

Would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Solid meal, I feel like this meal would cost $200+ for a couple in SF or NY, here it's about $40
Strange tip, if you've got a big group, they have bottle service - typically reserved for douche bags, and club kids, kinda seems effective here
Great menu, excellent service & atmosphere, very chill"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and enjoyed both visits a lot. This is probably the easiest \"izakaya\" in Montreal to visit, in that I find the menu to be the largest and most varied in its meats and fish (although vegetarians may not have a huge choice). Also, unlike places like Imadake, Ichigo Ichie, Biiru (and to a lesser extent, Kazu), the portions make sense. At those other izakayas, some dishes are very generous and priced low, while others are virtually bite-size and pricey. You don't really know until the dish comes out and often times, it's pretty disappointing to order a $15 dish and have it be gone in three (normal) bites. Otto has very fair prices and it's easy to eat well for little (especially with the skewers). Some standouts I enjoyed were the chicken curry over rice, grilled octopus, fried shrimp, and pretty much all the skewers (save for the pork belly, which didn't have enough seasoning for my taste). They have Sapporo on tap and sake. Most of the patrons both times I went were Asian, and on my second visit, we had several Japanese happily munching away. I only mention this because I usually don't see this at most other Japanese pubs in Montreal, and I take it as a good sign. It's a small resto, so make reservations. Lastly, another great feature is their opening hours: they are open until 2AM most nights! I can see this place being perfect for late night munchies post-drink!"}
{"text":"Went back for the second time because we really liked their Japanese curry !! This time there was more meat in the curry , I think because we came earlier this time. We also tried the pudding and it was heavenly !!! The pork belly was also better this time. The owner or the manager gave me cookies at the end and it was also really good. I'm in love with this place , wish they were open on lunch time though."}
{"text":"One my colleague/friend invited me here with other friends! I checked out the restaurant thru yelp, and I was excited to try this place since then. 

What a cute spot! Decor is colorful. Love their menu too. 

My friend ordered the food, so we can share them as Tapas. From grilled vegetables, to grilled meats, to fried chicken with truffle, to bibimbap and to roasted ice cream; everything single item was A1! The flavors were magnificent! 

The music in the background was superb, from Abba, Michael Jackson to reggae music. In my head, I felt I was on my feet dancing throughout the evening. 

Lovely place to try!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience at Otto last Friday. The service is really good and fast. Authentic Japanese Yakitori food!! I tried the chef selection which includes a bunch of chicken skewers, super tasty especially HATSU (heart of chicken)! We also tried the lobster sashimi, seriously, that's the best I have ever tasted, with wasabi and soya sauce. The patron is super nice too, provided warm service and even made a special drinks for us!! In a nutshell, there are really lots of choices and most importantly foods are FRESH. What could be better than tasting the Freshness of your food!! Really recommended and we will definitely go next time :)"}
{"text":"Authentic and it reminded of home. Great place to hang out with friend and talk. Cozy place that I would like to visit again."}
{"text":"Je suis seulement allé une fois mais je peut certifier que c'était délicieux et je compte bien retourner afin d'essayer encore plus de plats sur le menu. L'ambiance est bien et le resto est facile d'accès à partir du métro Guy Concordia. Tu t'en sors avec 30$ (très bien investis), de la bonne bouffe et des bons drinks. Honnêtement, si t'es jamais allé, mets ça dans ta bucket list. Thank me later."}
{"text":"Their service was slow and was also short-staffed. The food took a while to come. We ordered the Otto Bibimbap from hearing good things about it but was quickly disappointed by how bland it tasted. Friends who previously had the same dish was dissatisfied by it as well. Got their yogurt soju drink but it tasted like carbonated water with a very faint hint of the yogurt.  When we asked the waitress about it, she took the pitcher and added more \"sweetness\" to it which honestly didn't change anything. Part of our orders also didn't show up until we asked about them and then we were told that one was sold out and then they took even more time to get the other dish out. First time here and I was so disappointed I won't return."}
{"text":"Love the interior, gives a really cozy feel. We came super early, there was pratically no one, but the place did fill up quickly. It was my first time there, and the waiter was super friendly and attentive to my endless questions. 

I love the fact that they have specials of the day in addition to the regular menu, so that there is always something new to try everytime you come. I just tried a bit of everything: the chef selection of chicken skewers, the otto bibimbap, the beef tongue plate, the oysters and bone marrow, and their homemade pudding.

- chicken skewers: you get 10 chicken skewers for 18$, which is a pretty good price, and you get to taste a bit of everything. The chicken neck was my favorite because the meat was super tender. I will say the chicken was on the salty side, but i ordered a bowl of rice on the side so it was alright for me, but I feel like if you eat the chicken skewers on its own it can be a bit too salty. 
- otto bibimbap: The portion was on the small side. It does not come with gochujang like the authentic bibimbap, everything was already seasoned so you just had to mix everything up and eat. Unlike the usual bibimbap, there wasn't a lot of ingredient in it. And since the portion was small, the rice burnt really easily in the stone bowl...
- The beef tongue plate: once again it was really salty, but since I ate it with rice it wasn't that bad. The beef tongue were chewy and sliced thinly. I wish they put other vegetables other than onions. The crispy garlic slices were so salty, i regretted tasting it on its own.
- The oyster and bone marrow: the platting was on point. It came with fried sweet potato balls, which were really good. The oyster and bone marrow were flavorful and not too salty like other dishes. 
- Homemade pudding: I wish I knew the recipe of that dessert because it tasted so good, not overly sweet or egg-y, just perfect. 

Love the platting of every dishes. Gonna come back for the skewers, and I look forward tasting everything else on their menu. It is on the pricy side, but still worth trying."}
{"text":"First time here, went with group of 6. We made reservations, and were seated after a slight wait. Very small/cozy place. Food was excellent, especially appreciated how they had a variety of chicken parts, though no chicken tail sadly. Prices are fair for dt Montreal,  and considering the quality. Seasoning was very good and there was a nice smoky char from the grill. Water was refilled adequately. 

Truffle kaarage and sweet potato: very good, chicken was excellent, crisp, moist, and with a tangy, almost citrusy drizzle, potato balls was crispy on the outside with a fluffy interior.

Pork belly: well seasoned. Tasty but had slightly texture since it cooled down before I got a chance to eat it

Gizzard: very tasty but slightly too tough, but very good flavor and unique texture

Meatball: meh. Weird sponge texture

Chicken wing: very yummy! Chicken wings are hard to screw up 

Chicken and leek: leeks slightly over charred, but good caramelized flavors and tender texture

Lamb: very heavy cumin flavor. A bit less might be better but was still tender and quite good

Chicken breast: dry. Didn't like

Chicken thigh: good. Hard to mess up.

Vegetarian platter looked pretty good, nice variety. 

Waitstaff was not very professional, making a grimace of exasperation when we asked before ordering to split checks. She also stated that tips were included (4 of us heard this), but denied this when later asked while paying.
Our food came at different times and it was awkward waiting to start eating as our skewers were cold by the time others had gotten their order. Also, their wifi was nonfunctional this night, so no music, and worse, cash only payment...at least they had an atm thank goodness."}
{"text":"What a fantastic, delicious, and authentic Japanese restaurant!! I'm so shocked to find a place like this in Montreal. First of all, it's super inexpensive for what you get. They carefully charcoal grill yakitori (chicken skewers), and serve rare parts like \"Nankotsu\" (soft knee bone) and sunagimo (gizzard). I strongly recommend ordering Yaki-Onigiri (grilled rice ball) and super fresh Sashimi too!! They serve fresh Japanese draft beer that I was in love with.
Waitresses are so kind and attending. Love the interior and atmosphere too. If you want to have the BEST Japanese food in Montreal, this IS the place!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This hidden resto/bar has a great vibe and cool decor 
Tasty charcoal grilled skewered meats. Good drink selection.Friendly service.Open late!
Would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"They gotta delicious beef tongue. A must try! We also loved their alcohol. Skewers are well-seasoned.Staffs are super friendly and attentive. The restaurant however is very small and packed. We were a group of 12 people and they had to add a small table on the side for us. If you are having an event, it will be better to reserve in advance. Their bathroom is also very small u might be careful to not stumble when you turn. 
We have spent around 30$ ( taxes and tips included) per person. If you don't order drinks 20$ might be enough. Since the restaurant is an Izakaya(Janpanese often go to Izakaya to have a drink with friends and coworkers after work), the portions are not big, so you might want to order some rice to feel full filling."}
{"text":"Otto Yakitori is a cute little Japanese pub but not the best place to get dinner. My friend and I visited this place for dinner on a Wednesday night (no line ups, quick service), we each ended up spending roughly $20 but coming out hungry... and we aren't big eaters either. 

We ordered roughly 10 skewers to share (skewers range anywhere from $1,50 to $3). Out of the ones we tried, only the cumin lamb and the pork meatballs were properly seasoned, all the other ones lacked salt (we got chicken skin, chicken gizzard, chicken thigh, pork belly, chicken wings). 

We also ordered a small portion of fried chicken, they were very crunch but I wasn't a huge fan of their dipping sauce, which consisted for the most part of Japanese mayonnaise. It just felt too heavy. 

Overall, I would recommend for this izakaya for a pub night/late night snack but don't come hungry expecting a meal."}
{"text":"The food there is sooo good. The price is alright but I ended up spending much more than I wanted because I wanted to taste everything. Good selection of sake too."}
{"text":"We came here on a wednesday night at about 9:30pm. The ambiance is really nice, I would come back here with friends. The yakitoris are good, which they specialize in. I also tried the bibimbap which also pretty good. It seems like the perfect place to hang out with friends, have a bite and drink beer! The service was slightly slow but perhaps it wasn't the best night?"}
{"text":"For me this place is ideal for a late night treat. They have many kinds of skewers and grills. My favourites are the chicken with green onion and chicken skins. Only problem for me is the pepper flake on table is not spicy enough haha :)"}
{"text":"Good bbq. I like the chicken skin, Liver, and heart. So good.. But orders take time. Like 15mins wait.. too long. waitresses are so friendly and nice. Just really long wait and washroom is so small. Cant move.. If you are chubby, will be so uncomfortable for you. Good prices."}
{"text":"Real Authentic Japanese grill in town!
Best place for drinking sake,eating yakitori and chilling with friends"}
{"text":"It was in fact totally ok! Cute room, not too big or too small, not too fancy but cosy and kind of romantic even, small corners where you could chill and have a quiet conversation. The welcome and the service was friendly and helpful throughout. The food was tasty, but there were a couple things they could do that would really improve the menu and the dining experience in general in my opinion. For one, it was hard to find anything on the menu that was vegetarian, like proper no chicken no fish vegetarian. I'm not a full veg but I really prefer to eat mostly vegetables and have been finding it easier and easier to find delicious vegetable dishes made by our great local chefs. But not here, or at least not when I went. No vegetable dishes, very meat heavy menu. 

Meat skewers were the specialty, and they were tasty but it was just too much for me. The house smoked salmon rice bowl with roe was tasty but it was covered with a mountain of roe, way too much salty roe adding to the overall saltiness of the meal. 

Anyway, like I said, there was lots to like so I'd definitely try it again if folks were going there but I wouldn't head there on my own impetus."}
{"text":"I was really happy to see a Yakitori in Montreal. A Yakitori is an Izakaya that specializes in chicken skewers. They had everything from thigh to breast to wings, and if you're adventurous enough, try more exotic ones such as skin, gizzard, liver and heart. We tried a variety of skewers and liked the flavour. The beef tongue which was grilled on a cast iron plate was also very delicious. I'll be back for more chicken and drinks during the summer for sure."}
{"text":"A very nice place for chilling with friends after work! Foods are good and ppl are very friendly!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner #1 based on all this hype we've heard about and it was really quite underwhelming.  Don't get me wrong.  The yakitori tasted good here but it was seriously not mind-blowing nor was it worth the money.  Overall, skewers were good but I would not make a deliberate trip from Toronto to come back here."}
{"text":"El lugar si cumple su promesa. Es barato. Es rico. Es picante . ¿Cómo llegamos? No sabíamos donde íbamos. Era tarde. Bueno. Vinimos cómo salimos del hotel: un poco \"over dressed\". Pero la pasamos muy bien. El chico que nos atendió fue súper atento. Y el lugar estaba casi lleno. Más tarde más se llenó. ¿Que comimos? El calamar  grille. Riquísimo. El tofu en pinchos. Exquisito. Y el cerdo picante sobre arroz con huevo poché. Riquísimo. Bomba! ¿Volveríamos? Si. En otro momento viaje. Hay muchos lugares para recorrer. Es difícil volver a un lugar."}
{"text":"New restaurant in Montreal but already so popular! They stay open til late and serve small portions so it is the perfect place for a late night snack. They have tons of different and delicious yakitori (skewers) but also other mains that are worth a try like the Otto Bibimbap and Pork Spine Soup, probably even better than the yakitori, I can't make up my mind.
If you don't know what yakitori to order and are a bit adventurous, just go with the Chef's Selection sampler. Finish off the meal with their house made egg pudding, that will put your usual flan or creme brulee to a shame."}
{"text":"I really regret not trying thus place since it opened as i work just across the street, very cozy atmosphere, ordered the beef tongue and grilled squid both are amazing. the drink i went with long jack well not so much alcohol but will try something else next time as their drinks menu is big and very interesting cocktails to try from. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The service was so bad. The food is good, but I wait almost for an hour just for one food. In the end they said they forgot to order other food for us.
During the waiting time, I feel they ignore us. They didn't add any water when they sever the food for the next table."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for a late night snack. The servers were extremely friendly and was very detailed in explaining and recommending us dishes.

We ordered a platter of chicken yakitori. We paid an additional $2 to opt for no organs. All the skewers were absolutely delicious. The only complaint we have is that the skewers need a little more salt.  We weren't really a fan of the seasoning that came with it on the side because it was a little too spicy for us. So, if it was a bit saltier, it would've been perfect, then the skewers wouldn't require additional seasoning. The pork belly was pretty good too. As for the mushrooms, I feel like it was a little pricey for the portion... not that worth it.

Also tried the scallops, they were pretty fresh. 

Additionally, we ordered the beef tartare. This was delicious, it was the weekly special. If this is ever on the menu, you must order it! They are very generous with the portions and I love how they pair the tartare with beet chips. It's was really delicious, nice combination!

As for drinks, we ordered the matcha calpico. This drink was pretty unique. Never had this combination before, worth a try!

Overall, love that it's open late, definitely recommended in visiting if it's late and you're hungry or if you're looking for a place to chill with friends. They serve beer and other alcoholic drinks!"}

{"text":"Enfin un Yakitori qui ressemble à un vrai. Tout comme au Japon ils proposent toutes les parties du poulet même les plus improbables. On a goûté au Sasami, Sot-l'y-laisse, Tsukune & Negima. Toutes étaient délicieuses. Le karaage aussi était parfait. Le lieu pourrait être un peu plus accueillant, surtout avec cette porte qui se referme avec fracas, mais c'est loin d'être l'essentiel. J'y retournerai pour sur !"}
{"text":"Food taste was pretty good. It dose taste the charcoal grill flavour. Their ventilation was great in the kitchen you don't smell any of the grilling. The pork bone soup is really good too. Will go back!"}
{"text":"I was there for a late dinner last Thursday and the experience was rather disappointing.

The beef ribs were way too salty and the yaki tori, some were also too salty and some were tasteless.

The United steam egg and the tuna salad was better.

The ambiance was ok and the service wasn't that bad.

It is not my first time and it is definitely not my last time. They have potential and room to become much better. Hopefully I'll see the improvement next time I come :)."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here last night. 
We ordered a bottle of sake and a couple of beers. 
The service here was very good! i was very impressed. The food came so quickly and our water was always filled. 

First we had the ebi gyoza ( shrimp dumplings with spicy mayo). It was delicious! Some dumplings can have a lot of dough but this was done right. There was enough shrimp filling and the right amount of dough and spicy mayo makes everything taste good. It tasted to me the shrimp toast dishes that you can find in Chinatown.

Next we had the bibimbap.
I wanted to get the japanese curry because everyone on yelp seems to love this dish but the waitress recommended the bibimbap. I'm not usually a fan of bibimbap because I find it usually a bit bland but this one was very good. It was spicy and salty. 

Then we the following yakitori:
Buta  Bara (pork belly with Otto sauce ) - this was my favorite. The fat was juicy and it was the most tasty of the bunch we tried. 
Kawa (chicken skin) - I love anything with fat on it so for me this was so good! 
Hatsu (heart) - i was skeptical about eating heart but it was good. it wasn't chewy and the sauce was good. 
Liver - i hate liver but agreed to try it here because my friend wanted to. First of all it was cold!! Like it wasn't cooked! I even gave it to the waitress to touch it and she was surprised that it was cold so she heated it up for us. I ate half and gave the rest to my friend. I am biased because I hate liver but my friend who loves liver said it was his least favorite out of the yakitoris that we had.
Lamb - although it was a bit difficult to get the meat off of the stick compared to the other meats, I really enjoyed the lamb because of the spicy cumin seasoning on it. 

Lastly we had the truffle karage ( deep fried chicken thigh with sweet potato ball).The sweet potato balls were good. Let's be real anything deep fried is good. The chicken was good too but because we ate this last it wasn't as warm as we would have liked it to be and i think it would have been better warm. That's our fault though. 

Food is good and the service is great. Its also good for people on a budget. The yakitoris are very affordable and Ii was full after our meal."}
{"text":"After reading about it in La Presse, I knew I would enjoy Otto Yakitori. The whole grilled skewers thing mixed with an Izakaya very much falls within my sweet spot. 

I made reservations for 20h30 on a Friday and we got there to find out table almost ready, a very nice touch. The place was packed.

Being newbies, we ordered a few individual skewers of everything only to find that we would need about 5x the amount to satisfy our big men hunger. 

The chicken skewers are indeed quite good but it was mostly the other items on the menu that charmed me. The squid (both fried and cooked), the Kaarage, there was a shrimp roll thing that was delicious, and we had 3 servings of the beef ribs.

Total for 3 men with 2 bottles of Sake and 4 beers was about 200$ + tip, which feels a little steep, but honestly it was worth it and I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Izakaya is quite the trend in Montreal these days but I've not been super keen to try it out because it's rare that I'd go to a restaurant 'just for a snack'; it's always because I'm hungry, man! Give me a plate heaped with food! Not the case when you go Izakaya. But, decided to give this one a try since my friend who's quite picky about restaurants recommended it. 

Honestly I didn't really know what to order and that was mainly because I couldn't be sure whether to order a main dish with a side skewer or just order a bunch of skewers. Settled on the latter instead to maximize my Izakaya experience and, being a lover of fried anything and everything,  I got the fried chicken (karage) plate and chicken skin skewer, balanced with a pork belly skewer and grilled rice ball. The karage was very well executed. Crispy skin, tender juicy meat. It was served with some kind of garlic mayo. Went really well with the chicken. The skin skewer was also really nice and flavourful. The  pork belly was my least favourite because it was rather chewy and not so easy to eat off the stick. Flavour was good though. The rice ball was amazing, as far as rice shaped in balls goes! It was almost like Chinese style sticky rice, though not as sticky, and lightly sweet. The fact that they grilled it gave it an interesting texture. Lightly crispy on the outside and nicely sticky on the inside. In any case having that rice ball meant that my dinner was not entirely consisting of meat, so it was a nice touch, which is what I'm trying to say. 

It was a really nice Izakaya experience and the place quite cosy. I wouldn't take a vegetarian friend here though. About the only non meat thing on the menu is probably sake."}
{"text":"A good place for meat lover! So many different chicken brochettes to choose! This bistro is kind of expert of cooking chicken meat. Also, check out the pork meat bone soupe! It seems so big and tasted quite good."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  It's almost hard to miss from the street, and I'm glad I didn't!  The atmosphere is laid back and casual, and I thoroughly enjoyed the music. Great place to wind down my solo birthday trip. The service is extremely great and accommodating.  The food here was even better than my staple Izakaya spots back home in NY.  I had the spicy pork bone soup, chicken skin skewers (fav!), chicken oyster and skin skewers, pork belly and enoki skewer (special menu), roasted green tea ice cream -all paired with a refreshing and potent saki. The soup was so delicious and comforting!  I polished off that with 5 skewers before having to give in. The ice cream- which was the whole reason I chose to dine here as opposed to the neighborhoods various options, was put in a soup container for me to enjoy after my walk back to the hotel.  I would hands down eat here if I'm in the area again and highly recommend this to anyone looking for amazing food in a chill atmosphere with good music."}
{"text":"Best yakitori outside Japan. Best yakitori outside Japan.Best yakitori outside Japan. Period."}
{"text":"L'endroit est bien. Propre, volume sonore correct. Musique de fond sympas. La carte est bien fournie tant sur les plats, que les spécialités du jour et des boissons. La soupe de viande fut excellente. Les brochettes de poulets bonnes sans rien d'extraordinaire à vraie dire. Ça manque cruellement d'une sauce ! Desserts moyens biens. Service attentif. Rien d'extraordinaire mais quand même bien satisfait. Mon avis est peut être distordu à cause de la bonne compagnie. J'aurais plutôt mis 3.7 mais bon on va dans la simplification."}
{"text":"Just got back from Japan and this place did not disappoint. The selection of yakitori are on the point. Very authentic, I had the beer tongue that was my favourite among them all. They used green scallions instead of a leak in between the meet which is not think and juicy enough to balance the meaty skewer. I was very impressed by the pork belly one as well. The chicken tail is too fatty to my personal taste. The lamb skewer however lacked flavour and fat. I also loved the uni and ikura don although it's a bit expensive 36 for not much substance but the uni was verra fresh. The spicy pork bone soups was very comforting, dense and rich I loved it but it was not spicy at all and a bit blend, so I added some shrirasha I wished they had some spicy oil or a home made spicy sauce.  I would definitely be back to try the other things on the menu. Great place to impress a date for some authentic Japanese yakitori."}
{"text":"Great place for some Yakitori and beer for dinner or late night snack. Went there twice during my trip to Montreal. Love this place with great customer service and food. The short ribs and the squid were my favorite. Definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Pretty solid yakitori. My favourites: chicken tail and skins. Very good. The thighs (w and w/o scallions) are also enjoyable. Not a big fan of the meatball and pork belly. Veggies were ok.

The dinner menu looks far more extensive. Will try someday."}
