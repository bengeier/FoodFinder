{"text":"I ordered their roast beef pizza last night and it was amazing! I'm not a fan of potato sticks with my pizza, so I asked to have it on the side instead. The pizza is full of cheesy goodness, their roast beef just melted in my mouth, and the crust was not too thin/thick, just perfect. Also, compared to other restos nearby this place is really clean, like seriously you can feel how neat and clean the place is once you step inside. The staff seems nice and friendly as well. I wish they'd just mentioned there's garlic in their special sauce, but it's on the side,so no need to worry if you don't like garlic."}
{"text":"Restaurant looked completely different from outside. When we walked in we felt we were walking into somebody's home but in a good way. There was a family on the dining table who were enjoying the meal. We were welcome by two very nice people and they seated us. Decor looked fancy but the prices are decent. Food is delicious. Here are 5 reason why we will Absolutely go back when we visit again.   1. We ordered sandwiches and they were delicious. Parsley added great taste to the sandwiches. Bread was perfect for this type of sandwich.  2. We were not too hungry so we ordered one large sandwich which was good enough for two people. We ordered Tea and tea was as delicious.  3. Service was wonderful. They were super nice and accommodating. 4. All meats are halal 5. Their pizzas looked amazing on the menu and in pictures. We really wanted to go back to try it this trip but Montreal offered too many good restaurants and we didn't have a chance to go back. We will be definitely going back to try their pizza next time."}
{"text":"You never know what the interior is like if you come to grab a take out here. Take the stairs and find the cozy, warm and homey room with beautiful and chic furniture.  Persian music is on non stop not too loud to stop you from enjoying your meal. We ordered both roast beef pizza and the roast beef sandwich. Yummy and yummy  14-inch sandwich, cheesy and meaty!  Nice staff. Acceptable service. Decent food quality and reasonable check. I will stop by again for sure."}
{"text":"Best  pizza in Montreal. I would definitely recommend for you to get the hailar special. First time having Persian pizza and it did not let down. Very affordable, great service and food to perfection."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Hailar in almost a year but I have fond memories of my several informal forays into this cozy restaurant. Hailar is the kind of place where you're expecting a casual dining experience (because the food is honestly casual) but the ambiance is anything but. It looks like your fancy great-aunt's tea room upstairs. Old flowery curtains, clunky big furniture, it's almost like a character piece from a good TV show. The best way I can describe the food is like jazzed up bro-food. There are these Persian style pizzas with loads of meat on top and sandwiches, cold and hot, lots of casual eating and mediocre service from middle aged Iranian women. The entire experience is comically enjoyable. I love this place, have visited many a time and recommend it to the adventurous who want to try a different kind of fast food."}
{"text":"For muslims: its all halal! Enjoy! We highly recommend Hailar special pizza (Persian-style pizza) and shredded-beef Hailar special sandwich.  Really delicious!"}
{"text":"You guys. I have the most endearing story to tell you: Chez Hailar felt so bad about my negative experience with the service last night that they sent one of their employees to my apartment to apologize in person. AND he brought me a freshly baked pizza.   For my full review, check out: https://therealmtlfoodie.wordpress.com/2017/11/07/iranian-style-pizza-and-subs-in-downtown-montreal-who-knew/"}
{"text":"Everything is perfect there. Decoration, food , attitude  highly recommended  I took The soup and Pizza  taste good"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service . These guys know how to make mouth watering sandwiches and pizzas . I can't wait to try everything on their menu . And open late . :) 5 stars all the way"}
{"text":"Amazing food and very kind company. Service was good and prices are very reasonable. A 7\" sandwich is plenty!"}
{"text":"With all the positive reviews, I honestly expected more from this restaurant. We came here only to try their famous Persian style pizza, but surprisingly, they were out of pizza dough! This was just so unacceptable! We had a few choices from the menu. Their menu was completely different from the one they have on their website. The prices and the number of meals were different. We tried the shredded-beef special sandwich and the pizza sandwich. I loved them both. The shredded-beef sandwich had an exceptional taste. I only ordered the pizza sandwich just to get the taste of their pizzas, which was amazing!  P.S: Don't count on the 10% student discount cause they won't give you any!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza for an event from Chez Hailar. Service was excellent and delivery on time. The pizzas themselves were amazing, nothing like your traditional pizza place. Thin crusted, delicious toppings (we've tried the vegetarian and pepperoni pizzas), a spicy mayo-based dip. Would definitely recommend this restaurant !"}
{"text":"The tea was exactly the same as what I had in Iran. The pizza was normal. It was a bit cold. I don't recommend the banana milkshake because it was not milkshake but completely ice cream."}
{"text":"very cozy, good portions and great service. you really must try their dessert Majoon."}
{"text":"The area around Guy Concordia is home to some of the best ethnic restaurants in the city. You can find a dozen cheap and delicious eats just a stone throw away from the school. I had no idea this place existed until very recently.  Hailar is comprised of two floors: the first floor is dedicated exclusively for takeout orders. When you walk up the stairs to the second floor you're treated to a surprisingly luxe tea room dining area. Red velvet drapes add to the cozy and elegant interior.   They have a relatively small menu that consists of options between hot sandwiches or pizza. I have yet to try the sandwiches but I've gotten the vegetarian pizza each time I've come. For around $10/12\" pizza you'll definitely be getting your money's worth here. You can easily split this between two people and both be left feeling pretty full. The addition of potato sticks (weird ikr) give these pizzas a delicious, unexpected twist. To top it all off, the service is warm and friendly. Also, do yourself a favour and try their carrot cake. It's like eating a cake made by your mom. Definitely do give this place a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"De passage juste pour un thé nous avons monté l'escalier pour decouvrir ce petit resto café iranien tranquile mais trop eclairé à mon gout, service cordial."}
