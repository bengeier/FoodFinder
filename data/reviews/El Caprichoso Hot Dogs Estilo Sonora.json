{"text":"The place is great and deliciousness hotdogs. My friend suggested to me the place and I am happy I family found the time to come in. Service is fast and professional. Marry was nice. We will come again"}
{"text":"Best Sonoran dogs in AZ, always tasty for such a great price! Wouldn't recommend another joint."}
{"text":"They are a little on the pricey side, but a great tasting combination. The place is outdoors so it is a little warm when you eat there"}
{"text":"Service is always amazing. Of coarse the one that usually helps us is the guy that looks like the boy on the banner It's actually not him (we asked lol). He's always fast and friendly. The hot dogs are the best I ever had and I have actually driven to Tucson to try guero canelo before they moved her and there is absolutely no comparison. I almost forgot the chipotle sauce is incredible never had anything like it."}
{"text":"This is the Sonoran hot dog street vendor that sets up every day around 6pm at the northern edge of the Gorman's (Gorman Cooler Supply) parking lot just at the southwest corner of 35th and Thomas. Been here a number of times over the years. This is where I had my first Sonoran style hot dog. Went drinking with a friend at Las Portales and we came out one night and there this place was. Back then I ordered the Mexican chocolate drink and I think they had elote back then. I did not see elote the last time I went a few days ago but we came just before they closed at 1AM. They actually stay open till 3AM on Fridays and Saturdays. This location only takes cash so make sure you have some before coming here. I'm sure the majority of folks that come to this location are coming out of either Las Portales or Chica's - both of which are a hop, skip, and a jump away. The hot dogs are wrapped in bacon with crema and a bunch of other stuff. Really hits the spot after a night of bar hopping. Guy running this place gave me a loyalty card and when I looked at it, I realized it's not just this one location - this is just a node in the El Caprichoso Sonoran Hot Dog EMPIRE! Other locations are:

1) 2122 E. Van Buren
3) 9444 N. 19th Ave
4) 1118 N. 35th Ave
5) 406 N. 16th St
6) 2901 W. Van Buren
7) 4027 N. 27th Ave

This particular location is their #2 location. The only other one I've been to is the 19th avenue one. I like the hot dogs here better though. Perhaps there's slight variations among the various locations. Plenty of parking in the Gorman's parking lot as that business is closed at night. I'm pretty sure the other locations have a similar arrangement. Might want to brush up on your basic Spanish as well since the folks running the place speak little English. There was a guy in our group of misfits that was fluent in Spanish and that saved us from any communication barrier that might have existed if he wasn't with us."}
{"text":"I come from dallas to eat this, so you know they are good.  It's a staple for everytime I am in town. 
This hot dogs are not for everybody if you just like the basics."}
{"text":"Best Sonoran hot dogs in town! We drive over 20 minutes to get them & the are delicious!"}
{"text":"The best hot dogs I've ever had. I've tried different places but I keep coming back to this location. They are very good and the waiter is very friendly."}
{"text":"Just had my first Sonoran hot dog! Holy crap this place is amazing!"}
{"text":"really cheap. really great. really fast. the buns are so perfect as they are large enough to hold all toppings within. the toasting of the bread is an added bonus. The hot dog itself is small, but all that comes with it makes up for it. better choice than tacos after a night of dancing!"}
{"text":"The bun was amazing!! The workers were really friendly. I would definitely go back here"}
{"text":"We were in the area and I had just seen the owners story in the new times.  Walked up and the place was completely packed.  The owner was super attentive to everyone and took really good care of each customer.  As people came up he unloaded additional tables and chairs.  We ordered 4 hot dogs for my husband and I.  I did mine without katchup.  I love the cotija cheese on top as I had never had a senoran dog with cheese.  The onions and bacon added the perfect crunch.  I wish I would have grabbed a salsa that would have been perfect.  We will definitely be stopping by again."}
{"text":"BEST Sonoran dog I've ever had. It's alllllllll about the bread, not to mention the perfect crisp of the bacon on their amazing dog. And the condiments... don't get me started, and all for $3. I drove over 40 minutes to try this place and boy was it worth it. I don't think I'll ever be able to have another one somewhere else. Too yummy. Craving it again and I just had it yesterday."}
{"text":"Delicioso!  ...and that's the extent of my Spanish.

I found this place by sheer luck.  The freeway was closed, so I had to find an alternative route home.  I just happened to look on my phone and noticed that this place was nearby.  I'm glad I stopped, because it was very good.

I am a huge fan of Sonoran or Sonora hotdogs and El Caprichoso did not disappoint.

Phoenicians should feel very fortunate that they have such a vibrant Mexican culture, because for people like me who grew up in the Pacific Northwest we never had any food like this.  It is almost like a whole new world to us.

I highly recommend El Caprichoso.  They have excellent service and make a damn fine hotdog."}
{"text":"Normally, I do NOT eat hotdogs. My cousin raved about this place--UNBELIEVABLE the toppings that made my hotdog SO GOOD. The hot chocolate is an added bonus too! Tip: only eat with your fingers, tastes better."}
{"text":"So delicious! Went here last night with a group of friends. You can't go wrong with bacon wrapped hotdogs with the works at 11pm. It's impossible. So good and the bread was so yummy! Will totally be back and sharing with more friends!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for this place. I thought there was one listed off of 19th ave and dunlap but I never see one over there. Anyway, I ran into this location on my way home last night (saturday). They were busy. It's a food truck that has a large tent for seating. It's very cheap $3.50 for one loaded sonoran dog. About the hot dog.... It was so good! I could of ate the bun by itself. Too bad this is not closer too me. Definitely, will go back when I'm on that side of town."}
{"text":"Best Sonoran Hot Dogs in Phoenix, hands down. Well worth the stop!"}
{"text":"If I go for a late night Sonoran Dog, I usually travel to the one on 19th and Dunlap.  Always have, and always will....except for tonight!  I had read the reviews of this place and it looked a lot bigger and more spacious than the Dunlap one.  It was already late and I wanted to get home, so we went to this one since we were down near the 10.  I went with 2 hot dogs and a mandarin Jarritos.  A few things about this place compared to the 19th ave one.........

- This one has WAY more seating.  It was POPPIN!  There were easily 40 people there coming and going, getting their hot dogs.  They do a great business here!

- This one is also a tad more expensive for a hot dog ($3.50 here, compared to $3.00 at 19th).

- This one you have to order at the counter, then grab a seat.  I was used to the other one where they come take your order, so we sat there for a few minutes and eventually a guy came over, but that was an exception.  At this one, step up to the table, tell them what you want, then go take your seat.

- They do have an armed security guard here, which is nice.  The 19th Ave location is straight hood, and I have literally seen crackheads walking around and crossing the street etc, all while eating my dog.  Never really felt uneasy or scared, but I wouldn't mind if I was carrying while eating there.  This location has you covered if any riff-raff shows up.

- The hot dogs here are tasty, but not AS tasty as the 19th Ave location.  This location does so much more business, I think they need to pump out the dogs a lot faster.  The bacon was not grilled and crispy as the other location.  Since they use a cheaper style hot dog, the bacon really elevates the flavor profile, and this spot could have cooked/crisped it up a bit more.  The other ingredients were pretty much the same, and the buttered and toasted bun was delicious as always.

Overall, still a damn fine Sonoran Dog!  If you want a place to chill at and definitely have a spot to sit, this is your place.  If you want a slightly better dog for a buck or so less (assuming you eat a few and get a drink), go to the 19th Ave and Dunlap location.  Either way, El Caprichoso is the best Sonoran Dog in Phoenix (regardless of location)!"}
{"text":"Ordered 4 hot dogs and they not only made me wait for 30 min but skipped me in to serve other tables"}
{"text":"By far my favorite spot for Sonoran dogs..... This is no ordinary food truck setup.... If you're used to the bougie painted trucks with a window and then you go find a curb to sit on and eat that's not what you'll get here.... They have a tent area with easily 20 tables a flat screen TV condiments on the tables and even a seperate area to load up your dog beyond what they put on it. You walk up where the lines are roped desperately for order and pickup. There is a raised platform where all the cooking happens. They toast the buns on the grill so it's not soggy even with the bun as loaded as it is... They don't skimp on toppings which includes crumbled cotija cheese mayo beans ketchup mustard jalape√±o hot sauce..i just skip the tomatoes. I've paid cash but can't remember if they take card. They sell chips but it doesn't seem like they do a tostilicos kinda munchy.... Regardless of what part of town you are in give this joint a chance if you're lookin for a Sonoran hot dog.... If I could change anything it woukd be wrap it in a strip of bacon and grill the dog itself for a few."}
