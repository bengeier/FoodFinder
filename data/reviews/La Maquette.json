{"text":"I went here using a Groupon, after my boyfriend had told me this used to be his favorite restaurant. Used to be. Not anymore!  I'm not a picky eater by any means, but this is the worst meal I've ever had in a restaurant. Ever. I ordered the jumbo roasted quail with chutney, and got stewed quail with jam. The vegetables were substituted without telling me that they would be. The wait staff were inexperienced. The deconstructed tiramisu tasted like Play-Doh.   This place has a fantastic location and great potential. It's a shame that they're not actually serving edible food."}
{"text":"I came here a few days ago with my boyfriend.  As previous entries have stated, it was billed to me as very romantic and I thought it would be a really good pre-Christmas craziness, relaxing, romantic evening.  I'm not sure if I went on an off night, because while quite pretty, I was one of the youngest people there - and I'm in my 30's!  All I could think of is that my Grandparents would have LOVED that place.  We started out with the French onion soup.  When it first arrived, I felt a moment of disappointment as the top of it wasn't drenched in cheese as I'm used to however it tasted fantastic.  Really flavourful and I didn't miss the cheese at all.  For the main, I had the duck confit and I quite liked it while my boyfriend had the scallops.  I actually liked his better as it came with a nice risotto.  The food was quite good, but I didn't dig the vibe.  It just wasn't my kind of place.  As we were walking past, I wistfully looked at Origin next door and made a mental note that I would try that next time."}
{"text":"I went for winterlicious and the veal was really good.  Nice decor, service was pretty good."}
{"text":"This place must be a front for something. The digs are lavish but the food and service are terrible. It's always empty. How do they stay in business?"}
{"text":"This place I have passed by and always wondered if I would come to eat at a place like this. I can see the ambience and decoration of this restaurant is really insightful and pleasurable to view. Luckily I got a voucher deal just like quite a few of you yelpers to enjoy the evening.  Came in on a tuesday night...Nice weather, so opted to sit outside with my gf. Had a server that reminded me of 'Michael McDonald from Mad TV'...  Started off with a drink of some sort that had taste of lychee mixed with some wine...forgot what its called, but the drink was alright.  Received our bread and to our surprise...the bread is served COLD! With cold butter as well...Guess we're all use to warm or hot bread, but no biggie. Funny thing, we requested for some olive oil with balsamic and our waiter poured it on a side plate and brought it to us, but spilled it on our table...That's when I saw some comedic laughter from him reminding me of Mad Tv...lol...  We ordered the wild mushroom strudel ($16) which had leed and spinach creem sauce...The presentation was quite nice like a spider web of sort. It was served warm and it reminded me of tasting some sort of pancakes. My gf really enjoyed it though. - Second app was the Steamed Mussel Thai curry broth with veggies...I personally enjoyed this because its different broth compared to the usual of white wine and garlic. My only complaint to this dish is it tasted not really FRESH mussels, but maybe stored in the fridge a few days. But the broth was something I would have over and over again...YUM!!!  Our mains: I got the Wild Mushroom Agnolotti which is basically filled half moon dumplings with veggies... This was alright to me, its not something I usually try, but I thought its something new to taste. My gf got the 10oz Black Angus Steak and she really enjoyed it. Medium rare= Correct!  Dessert we shared the Warm chocolate Eruption Cake with vanilla ice cream. The desserts was alright, which it was definitely more gooey in the centre out of the cake...But its good.  Overall: We enjoyed our time at this place, and would say we had a good time compared to other yelpers who did not. We would actually come back as regular customers to eat. It is a bit pricey, but once in a while its okay..."}
{"text":"Melodious guitar playing gentle classical soft-rock/soft-pop, white table cloths and lots of cutlery -- sounds like a romantic French restaurant! Great, except partway through the meal, the guitar music turned into a increasingly loud and painfully deafening experience. I can't comment much on the food, it was pretty good, but difficult to enjoy with hands over your ears."}
{"text":"I read lots of glowing reviews (on a competitors site) about this place being fantastic for weddings.  Our experience however was that there were too many structural obstructions to get a good view of the head table. A different location may have helped a bit but it's just not designed for the focus of 100 people on any one spot. About 16 people including us were seated behind a wall about that was about 7 or 8 feet wide.  I could only see one person at the head table.  So I guess if wanted to forego eating my dinner while they spoke I could have stood in the corner to see better.  My wife however can't stand for that long which leads me to another issue.  The dining area is upstairs, a lot of stairs,...and there is no elevator or other means of access for those who are disabled.  There is a nice outdoor courtyard but it also suffered from the same problem of structural obstructions.  The food was very good.  The steak was nicely cooked to medium-rare, which I haven't found often in these kind of events.  The wait staff although very polite were disorganized, perhaps not being used to serving a gathering of 100 people.  One final thing. I'm not sure who provided the public address system but they appeared to only have one wireless microphone which repeatedly cut out on the speakers. Definitely not professional in my opinion.  I would recommend this place for an intimate dinner for couples or friends, and perhaps a small wedding party of 30 or 40 but not  for 100 or more."}
{"text":"I went here on a Living Social deal on Nuit Blanche two years ago and I know this review is a little late, but the food wasn't memorable, the wait staff almost spilled red wine over my new cream leather purse - what I was hoping for was a romantic dinner with my boyfriend - I ended up just feeling overall disappointed.  I hope they have improved since."}
{"text":"Although this is a nice and classy spot, I do expect better from a restaurant that is deemed more \"upscale\" than average. Pastas are not memorable, but they do make tasty seafood dishes. Tasty yet, should be better given the price point. Don't have a problem with the service, and if you catch performances on Friday night those are always nice."}
{"text":"The food is below par and the service was terrible.    I was given melted sorbet and was told it was Gazpacho.  Granted, it was part of a summerlicious menu but quite frankly: I will not ever go back."}
{"text":"I went with a Groupon and had the worst table service I've had since moving to Toronto 8 years ago.  In my opinion the menu is a bit dull and totally overpriced. My Groupon saved me a few bucks, but due to the poor service and the mediocre food I left feeling ripped off. I would never go back."}
{"text":"Very disapointed. The food was fine, but that's just it...at $40 a plate, do you really want a 'fine' meal?  Ordered the seafood risotto and it had hardly any seafood in it. It was also cooked in some sort of creamy bechamel sauce. Risotto in a creamy white sauce? That's news to me.  Service was fine. It's nice sitting outside I guess. Inside it lovely but a bit stuffy.  I asked for my meal to go and the waitress brought out a plastic container for me to scrape my leftovers into...myself. Didn't really appreciate that!"}
{"text":"We had booked La Maquette for a corporate dinner.  It was a very pleasant experience: food was very good, ambiance lovely and Ange, the owner very good to work with."}
{"text":"Went to La Maquette for a corporate dinner last night. The place looks really nice but it was absolutely empty. Second bad sign was no paper towels in the bathroom. I exited the can with soaking wet hands and found a waiter who was cutting lemons in the back to ask him for some towels. He looks in a cupboard and produces an almost finished roll of paper towels which he hands me. Then he takes my used towel, tosses it out and goes back to cutting lemons without washing his hands. Forget about refilling the towel dispenser in the bathroom!  Dinner was OK but certainly not worth the prices. The scallops in my app were overcooked. My venison chop main was cooked right and the scalloped potatoes were good but I couldn't help thinking about the unsanitary waiter.  Don't bother with this place. It's not worth it nor is the cuisine particularly French."}
{"text":"This is certainly one of the most attractive places to dine in Toronto but that's where it ends. The service was bad, the food ok but way over priced, and I've never seen a more over priced wine list in my life. I know most restaurants mark up bottled by 100% but to pay $55 for a bottle of Sterling Chard. that you can get at the LCBO for $12.95 is robbery"}
{"text":"I was definitely curious about going to dinner last night at La Maquette after reading that it would likely be empty - it being a Tuesday night and all. Walking up to the restaurant and seeing only a teenager sitting in the front window eating ice cream didn't really do much to assuage my concerns about what would become of my mother's  birthday dinner. To give some context, my mother picked La Maquette for her birthday dinner because she had held successful business dinners at the restaurant about a decade ago, and had recently scooped up a groupon-type coupon for the place.  The host at the front door was friendly, attentive, and helpful - she wanted to seat us where ever we would be comfortable in the busier second-floor dining room.  Fine, fine, it all started out well, the waitstaff was satisfactory at the beginning of the meal.  About the food - it was fine as well - I had the pear and onion tart to start before enjoying the beef stew (very yummy but a little odd since it is served with broken lasagna noodles mixed in). However, none of my food was more than warm - and it certainly isn't difficult to get stew to the table hot!  My mother sent back her lamb because neither it nor the sides were even close to warm. She was only more frustrated when the now warm dish was returned with well-done lamb when she had originally requested medium-rare. In the end she went ahead and ate it because my father and I had finished before her plate had even been returned (not sure what the appropriate etiquette is but my mother encouraged us to eat before our meals were cold as well).   The last straw was when the waitstaff disappeared never to be seen again after they had cleared our dishes. We sat for about an hour chatting and waiting for any indication that the cheque would be coming soon. Unfortunately the waitstaff never returned to our side of the dinning room (just outside the lovely solarium) so my father followed one of the waitstaff into the back area to request the bill.  In the end, no tip was left as per the birthday girl's wishes. When my mother spoke to the owner to explain why, an apology was made, but no offer was made to adjust the bill or make amends.  Yummy though it was, we won't be back"}
{"text":"I was given a voucher for $80 worth of food at La Maquette for my birthday.  My dining partner & I managed to get three entrees out of that:   Roasted Lamb Shank Broiled Scallops & Risotto Vegetarian Wellington   The food was room temperature, at best.  Nothing was even served warm.  The lamb shank would have been more tender had it been the proper temperature.  Because it was cold, the meat and tendons were tough.  The scallops, though large, were full of sand and lacking scallop flavour.  The vegetarian wellington would have also been more tasty had it not been cold.    Service was very \"meh\".  It was a tag team of two waiters, the older gent was very nice and fun, while the younger one lacked some proper manners.  Sorry, La Maquette, but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Really romantic atmosphere with live music, guitar playing in the background. I had the pan-seared scallop... It was cooked nicely but the side of coconut rice was salty. The warm chocolate eruption cake was...not eruptive...abit  overbaked. I want to like this restaurant but the food is really mediocre consider the price...dinner for 2 including wines was $160. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Tonight, I went to La Maquette with two girlfriends. One of them had a gift certificate to this place, so we went, and having read the Yelp reviews beforehand, I braced myself for the worst. We were late, going to be half an hour late for our reservation, and I didn't inform the restaurant. They called me, but I thought one of my friends was calling me, in an accent, until the woman from the restaurant mentioned my reservation. Since I kept asking her to repeat herself, she asked if I could speak English. That was justified, but still... I felt taken back and insulted.   Upon arrival, there was NO one at the desk. No bell, or anything. We heard noise from upstairs, and we waited for a few good minutes before she came down. There was also no one sitting downstairs, vacant! When going upstairs, she took our coats and my friend said something in mumbles, and she asked my friend if she could speak English, which was also justified in asking that, but I felt taken back (again), and felt that was rude.   Upstairs, it was a very nice and quiet. Only one man sat there, it was just us and him. As the dinner progressed, other people did come in, but.. still pretty vacant. As such, they kept asking us every few minutes if we had ordered, but this lady was different and was very nice about it.   Food was okay. Probably my fault. I really wanted to get the foie gras as an appetizer, but I had heard from my mother that they force feed the ducks, and I didn't want to encourage that behaviour, considering I am against animal testing. But I had also never eaten foie gras before, I am proud to say that I picked out the Mushroom Strudel, and I'm not a mushroom fan, but I liked the pastry. For the main course, I picked out the Seafood Risotto. I realized that it had white wine in it, but I didn't know it would REEK of it. I know, I should expect it, in a French restaurant, to expect food cooked with alcohol, but... I hate alcohol in my food. I didn't know it would stench so bad with white wine. I didn't eat 80% of my main course, I took it to go. My friend thought her Vegetable Risotto had \"bursts\" of sweetness in it, and later, she said the restaurant didn't come up to par, so she probably wouldn't be returning. My other friend had the Quail, and she really enjoyed it. For dessert, I got Creme Brulee and my friend got the Chocolate Eruption. I LOVED my dessert, highlight of my meal, I'm a sucker for Creme Brulee and it was SUCH a huge portion.   Food service was very quick, probably because it was only us and maybe two or three tables. I have to say, scenery was lovely, and I love that there was a light up tree near our table. At the end of our meal, we asked them to split the cheque, and they did. My friend wanted to use her gift certificate, but since she only had a salad and her Vegetable Risotto, she didn't have enough to qualify to use her gift certificate, so instead, we asked them if we could put the cheques together and use it that way. And, our waitress let us do that. She was very nice about it too. We even received a 15% off coupon, and based on their website, you can only receive that VIP coupon if you come to their restaurant 3 times a month, so I was happy we got it with one visit. Although my friend said she would prefer not come back, she might for us, since my other friend and I are avid coupon users!    It's an okay restaurant, it wasn't as bad as I would have thought, but not great. Still trying to find a great French restaurant. Probably will be back to use the coupon but if they hadn't given us the coupon, probably wouldn't be back. There are much better restaurants in the GTA."}
{"text":"We stopped by as part of Summerlicious and even with the those prices it didn't really meet the value equation. My lamb was over cooked (for what I asked for) and my date's lobster was undercooked. Everything was tasty and the veggies were fresh and well cooked (nice and crisp). Staff were excellent and the ambiance is very nice. Wine list was fine. All in all I wouldn't rush back unless they get a new chef."}
{"text":"The reviews here have been accurate. Really nice patio with the sound of a water fountain and shade. Nice place to sit and relax but the food is mediocre for a restaurant that's aiming to be upscale/bistro-like. Went here for Summerlicious and my meal came out to $23 + tip.   I ordered the curry chowder (really it's a vegetable broth), trout on rice with steamed vegetables, and lemon-coconut cake. It was decent and simple but I swear I can make the same soup and entree myself at home without paying to have it plated at a nice restaurant.  A coworker sent back a soggy pasta and received half off the price of the Summerlicious menu. Slow service."}
{"text":"I went to La Maquette with my family for Mother's Day brunch this past weekend and our experience was so bad it was almost funny. I'm astounded they're still in business.  Brief background: although it was my first visit to La Maquette, I've grown up hearing about this legendary restaurant. My parents have patronized La Maquette for over twenty years and hosted two private events here (a bar and bat mitzvah, respectively). They also attended a wedding at La Maquette during its heyday in the 1980's. My, how the mighty have fallen...I don't even know where to begin.  For starters, it took 45 minutes for someone to take our order after we were seated. We even had to chase down a waiter for a bread basket. Our table was completely ignored for almost the entire time we were there. The servers were akin to the Lochness Monster: many reported sightings, but no actual confirmation of their existence. Finally, one emerged and we were able to place our order. Then came the food...  My mom ordered Eggs Benedict, which were so overcooked that they had to be returned. How any self-respecting chef could let something like that leave their kitchen is another great mystery of La Maquette, along with their phantom waitstaff. After her plate was returned, however, we were informed that the kitchen was all out of Eggs Benedict and she couldn't order another round. She decided to settle for the scallops; several minutes later, however, we were told they were out of those as well. By some miracle, she was able to finally to place an order for spaghettini with mussels. She took a couple bites, said it tasted like \"wedding food\" and left her mother's day brunch completely famished.  I ordered the vegetarian risotto after being told they couldn't remove the ham from the Eggs Benedict (I follow a plant-based diet). It was so bland that I wasn't able to finish it, and that's saying a lot, considering how hungry we all were after waiting so long for our food. My brother and I also ordered chocolate crepes, which we foolishly believed would contain actual chocolate (although in fairness, they may have sprinkled some 90's-era chocolate Nesquik in the batter). They were soggy to the point of inedible, along with the wilted strawberries. My parents to struggled to finish their watery coffee (at a charming price of $4 a cup) before we finally accepted defeat.  To top it all off, we were charged for the wrong wine, adding $15 extra to our bill. The whole ordeal felt like a scene from a movie. It was a complete disaster from start to finish and set us back around $200. Based on the comments we heard from the tables around us, we aren't the only ones who regretted our decision to eat there. There are simply too many excellent restaurants in Toronto to waste your time and money at La Maquette. Like the tired Grecian statues in the entrance, its time has come and gone.  *Note: The one saving grace of La Maquette is their maître d, who looked completely mortified by the entire operation. He was so pleasant and friendly and must have apologized to us a million times. He belongs in a much classier establishment, and I hope he takes no offense to this review, as we all thought he was wonderful. (He also had fabulous glasses)."}
{"text":"I was a little surprised when I looked up La Maquette on Yelp just now and saw how unimpressed people seemed with their experiences here. I went with some colleagues for their Summerlicious menu today and our lunch was absolutely divine! I agree with the most recent reviewer (Christian P. on July 13th 2012).  Maybe their rankings are suffering because Origin and some other trendy restaurants are so close by and also outside Summerlicious, their menu is priced quite high. I don't know if I would have ever chosen to dine here if it weren't for Summerlicious. I don't think I had ever even heard anything about this restaurant.   We chose to sit on the patio which is covered by an awning. Beyond the beautiful setting, which includes bright pink flowers, a fountain, an interesting white sculpture and an ivy filled wall, the food was great and a real value at 20 dollars for a 3 course meal!  Between myself and my other lunch companions, we tried:   Steamed Mussels white wine, curry, garlic, herb  Mesclun baby greens lemon honey vinaigrette  Ontario lamb loin blue berry port and thyme reduction, mini vegetables and house potatoes  Baked Salmon Trout with a lemon aioli, fresh herb and mini vegetables  AMAZING*****Mango Raspberry Mousse*****AMAZING white biscuit surrounds mango mousse and raspberry mousse; finished with an orange glaze of white chocolate and pink daisy  Chocolate truffle Vanilla bean, crème Anglaise  The salmon trout was cooked to perfection, the port and thyme reduction smelled heavenly and I was told that the mussels were good as well (tip: great flavorful sauce to dip your bread into). Clearly, I was taken with my dessert: they had me at \"mango mousse\".The texture and flavour combination was just blissful... every single bite was a delight! The service was also decent. If they are part of Winterlicious, I would go back during the work day again and would suggest that my friends or other Yelpers do the same!"}
{"text":"The actual building itself is a pretty good space, two floors with a nice winding staircase in the middle, a private dining room in the back, and a solarium type of area facing King Street. The decor however, just seems antiquated, a makeover could really do the space justice.   The food was uninspired, that's really the only way to describe it. While I certainly respect simple, the flavours need to be exceptional if you're going to go this route, and they just weren't. The service, like the wine list, was a bit awkward.  Overall the place has real potential, but at the moment just seems a bit lost."}
{"text":"La Maquette isn't as bad as some of the reviewers claimed, but it wasn't spectacular. This was our Winterlicious try-out, thus our 1st-impression. Food was above average, portions smaller than the photos posted here. Due to the Winterlicious crowd, service was efficient but hurried, and ambiance was anything but romantic--very noisy and bustly. The best part was the live music on the upper terrace: a solo classical guitarist. Just too bad his otherwise soft chords were being drowned by the uncomfortable din, which, again, is the nature of such a promotional event as Winterlicious--discounted menu for the discount crowd."}
{"text":"I was here for a private event on Thursday night.  There's something to be said for a restaurant on one of the busier nights accepting a reservation for a private party taking up half the restaurant.  I want to take this review from both perspectives, as a diner at the restaurant, and for holding a private event.   The event was for about 40-50 people. Both having informational portions and networking, it was a good space. They gave the down stairs area, where the front entrance is. It's opulent looking, with the bar right there, was a good space, but cozy.  The piano didn't really help.  The cost of the event was around $30 a person. I know the host does not make any money on this, and if anything, breaks even. Our admission didn't include drinks, and only the space and the hor d'oeuvres being passed around.   The food wasn't anything fancy. There was a veggie platter, and some over baked phyllo pastries, skewer for shrimp, a toast with tomato and cheese, and some steak on toothpicks. There was quite a bit, and enough to fill you up somewhat.   The only complaints I really have for the space, was a) when the waiter had to run across our presentation in order to get wine from behind b) the hostess desk at the entrance is equipped with a computer and a phone - the phone would keep ringing and disturbs everything c) regular diners coming in not sure where they needed to go  As a regular diner, they kept the upstairs for the reservations. I wasn't even sure if it was empty or not, it was so quiet, you could hear a pin drop. When our speaker was going, we had some customers speaking loudly. When we got to our networking portion, I'm sure it was disturbing to the regular diners.   Your best bet for parking is $7 flat rate at the Metro around the corner."}
{"text":"Was here a few weeks ago with an old friend who I haven't seen for many years. Overall the atmosphere very relaxing and the meal were delicious, while the service was on par as well. Since it was a little cool outside that night we decided to eat inside rather than on the outdoor patio, but I kept looking out enviously at that patio and will have to go back sometime to have a meal there."}
{"text":"I've been to La Maquette twice and each time I left satisfied and with a smile. The last time we visited, my girlfriend and I ordered the Calamari to start, the Seafood Risotto and Black Angus Striploin as entrees, and the Citrus Cheesecake and Profiterole for dessert.   From start to end, we enjoyed every bite. It's a thing of ours to try the Calamari wherever we eat and the calamari at La Maquette is so far the best we've had. My gf enjoyed her seafood risotto and the good sized portion she received, even having to ask for a to-go container, since she needed to save room for dessert. I should have taken a cue from her, because I ordered the steak and it was grilled perfectly, with each bite being as flavourful and the last, I finished every last bite. This made eating my profiterole more challenging then it should have been, but once I bit into its chocolate and pastry goodness, my stomach magically made room and I was able to finish it. My gf fell in love with the citrus cheesecake the first time we came here and she made sure to order it again.   When we arrived, the hostess was quick to seat us on the patio, where there was a Flamenco guitarist playing, the first time we went, there was a pianist playing, they were both great at setting the mood. Our waiter was attentive and funny, even cracking a joke in Spanish with me. I'm surprised by the rating that La Maquette has, but everyone has different experiences. Fortunately, for me, my experience with La Maquette has been a great one."}
{"text":"Is it just me or do a lot of places like this don't care much about serving the less wealthy people properly for summer/winterlicious??  My husband and I was here on Sat night for a summerlicious dinner, and I really wanted to like this place.  We got there, and were seated on the patio as we requested.  We sat down and noticed even though the tables were all nicely lined with white tablecloth, a little real flower in a mini vase, and candle - the chairs were the cheap forest green plastic chairs you can find from crappy tire.  To start, we had complimentary cold bread and hard butter to 'spread' - clever...Then, I had the gazpacheo, and my husband had, what was described as 'seafood chowder'.  The waiter were suppose to provide us with spoons for the soup before or at the same time it arrived, but he didn't.  We had to get the food runner to provide us with spoons.  My soup wasn't bad, but his \"chowder\" was nothing at all what it should've been.  It was a clear broth, with one nickle size shrimp, and a bunch of cubes of what we thought was potato, but wasn't.  The entrees were pretty good, although it took a while to arrive.  We got the entrees at 8:11pm, and probably finished eating it around 8:30.  By the time we got our dessert, which we ordered cake, and creme brulee - it was quarter after 9!!  Forty-five minutes to get desserts to us?!! SERIOUSLY???  And the waiter didn't even apologize for the long wait or anything.  It took over 2 hours from start to finish for dinner, for the 2 of us, thanks to the slowass service.  Never again will we come back - save your money, people, unless you have money to wipe your ass with, and all the time in the world."}
{"text":"I took my absolutely stunning girlfriend for dinner to what I'd read in reviews as one of the most romantic restaurant's in Toronto.  I'd made an online reservation and also told them it was her birthday.  I'd requested patio seating and was told in the response that my seating could not be guaranteed.  WTF?  We did get sat on the patio - oddly, the sculpture garden had no sculptures but the waterfall ambiance was relaxing and romantic as I'd hoped.  We ordered a bottle of wine and both excitedly ordered the seafood risotto.  I thought our waiter was great - quite friendly and I had no problems with service from beginning to end... well, except for the fact that they seated people ajacent to our table, which is a bit annoying when there is a whole open patio of available seats and you are trying to have an intimate experience.  The seafood risotto was served piping hot and was quite tasty.  Though, I was quite disappointed with the amount of seafood.  There was almost one full scallop, a shredded piece of overcooked lobster, one mussel and two shrimp.  I didn't bother complaining... because the waiter had actually brought us a bottle of wine $15 higher in value than the one we'd ordered because they were out of stock of the lower end Pinot Grigio.  And maybe the wine was starting to work...   We ordered the creme brulee which was served with candle... cute... I suppose that's classier than a birthday song.  They also put \"Happy Birthday\" --- $0.00 on the receipt.  That was funny... but they still charged for the dessert.  At least the wine was upgraded!"}
{"text":"I went down for a good friend's birthday dinner, and this happened to be during Summerlicious. While I'm  approaching the front of the restaurant, it had a very simple exterior design, I spied a nice quaint little outdoor patio off to the side as I was walking through the front door. I was greeted with a warm old school French interior decorating.   A very friendly reception asked me which party I was with and I replied, he then pointed in the direction with clear precise directions unlike some places I've been to. I sat down and started to read the menu so we could quickly order as I was late to the party and everyone else had been waiting, only to find out it was lunch menu I was looking at. Being that we were there for dinner, that didn't help. Looking at the menu next to me, we quickly put in our order.  The service was pretty friendly and were very knowledgeable of the wine list which was very helpful, even through we ended not ordering the one that was recommended mainly because one was ordered from before I arrived. I did noticed through that the wine list was slightly overpriced.  Our appetizers came in very good time, I had ordered the salad which was very good. Next our main course came, I got the lobster and scallop, which was somewhat of a disappointment. It was a little tough and overcooked, which made me missed the salad. We chatted for a bit and the waiter came by and proceeded to clear the table for dessert. The dessert came and even through it looked mediocre , it certainly wasn't.   The dessert definitely made up for the out of placed main course. The bill came and the pricing was what you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. It ended up being about $50-58 per person, which was alright.   Would I come back to this restaurant? Let's put it this way, I wouldn't purposely go out of my way to go to it, but I would probably agreed to go to it in the future."}
{"text":"Great ambience. Extremely attentive and sincere waiters. Food were served with finesse and tasted delicious. However, the restaurant was absolutely freezing when we went. To a point where I wish I hadn't checked in my coat with them. An incorrect beverage was served to us and my steak did not come with a knife. Other than the small hiccups, the place is great for a nice romantic dinner."}
{"text":"I wish I could give La Maquette even more stars. Every thing is absolutely delicious. The staff is wonderful. The ambiance and the location is perfect. I loved it so much that I've been having monthly events there. They cater perfectly as a preset menu and take very good care of my attendees. i highly recommend."}
{"text":"Decor is amazing.  Scallop is huge and cook perfectly.  Fois gras is great (sorry duck, I just want to give it a try).  Seafood risotto was disappointing.  It' boring in term of taste and presentation.  Service is a bit slow, considering that there were only a few tables at the time.  Over all, I enjoy it."}
{"text":"I went here for summerlicious 2014 and this place had way better food and Summerlicious options than other \"fancy\" restaurants. First of the restaurant decor is very class and romantic, mainly a black and white theme. The reason I wanted to try this place is because of its  beautiful and quaint patio. Among the concrete giants on king street this patio with a water fountain looks very pleasant! I had the seafood crepe, veg risotto and mango torte from Summerlicious lunch menu. The seafood crepe with rose sauce was very delicious! The rose sauce was well prepared, the risotto was a little bland in my opinion but you could tell it was freshly prepared because I could see the steam from my plate! The mango torte was essentially a mango mousse cake, which was the ideal summer dessert and a fair size slice! I wanted to give this place a four star because of its ambiance, portion and taste... But because my main was good but a little bland I am opting for a three."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious and I have to say for the overall experience it was....OK.  The space is truly beautiful, however the waitstaff imparted the feeling like they hated Winterlicious, which can be understandable as it is a busy time of year however why should I as I diner have to feel the servers frustrations?!  Alas we made the most of it, the dessert was not something I enjoyed either but like I said the space was very pretty!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the \"awards\" in the front window. This is not a good restaurant and that should have been clear by the fact that it was absolutely empty. The second clue was the random and unusually low-end wine list i scanned while my husband whispered across the table \"this menu is weird.\" Alarmed by his immediate findings I looked at the food and was struck by the same feeling. This menu is completely random, as if a chef was playing a drinking game and grabbed random things from a cruise ship buffet menu. There was no clear way to piece together courses even though it was divided into course sections on the menu. We carefully chose the safest things we could think of. My husband said, \"how could they screw up a wellington? they serve that at the cafeteria at work\"   [enter laugh track]  As demonstrated this evening, the way to screw up a Wellington is to put it in a microwave. I'm not sure what happened. I could speculate that the chef went on holiday and said \"ok, I put everything in the freezer, all you have to do is reheat it\" just like mom did the first time we were left to baby-sit our little siblings.   My husband's risotto was also a non-event. We dodged the dessert menus and asked for the bill which was more than we paid at Chez Panisse last month but we were willing to pay anything just to leave."}
{"text":"I'm actually pretty happy with this place. Liked the duck I got, was well cooked. My lychee martini was kind of weak but I actually don't drink that much so that's ok. The space is beautiful and the live music is great. Our waitor was very attentive and our bills were separated, no peoblem. I dont get why some reviewers are so harsh on this place."}
{"text":"2 stars is the a fair rating I can give. The first star is the ambiance-it is a romantic place for a date. There was a live guitarist playing songs ranging from spanish music to love story by Taylor Swift. The 2nd star goes to the waiter who was with us (don't know his name but he was an older kind gentleman). He was very courteous and accommodating.   Food: I ate during summerlicious and the food was not up to par compared to other establishments in terms of taste. Three of us ordered lobster. the luckiest person had a portion of lobster with generous sides, while me and another friend had a really small serving.   Interfering, rude staff: When reserving our table we indicated that we preferred to pay separate bills. On explaining this to our waiter, another waiter overheard our conversation and stepped in and told us flat out 'No'. He said it wasn't the establishments policy to accommodate the option of paying separately unless we indicated it in the beginning of the reservation. He than turned to one of my friends who chuckled and informed him that this wasn't a laughing matter and it was very serious. The way he spoke to us was rude, as though we did something something bad. In the end our original waiter came back and we settled the one bill but split into different payments.  Maybe it was one of those nights where things got screwed up and maybe the rude waiter had a bad day; however, I still expect professionalism coming from the staff and also uniformity when it comes to the food."}
{"text":"Attended an intimate wedding ceremony and reception here, the restaurant's appearance is charming and classy.  The ceremony took place on the first floor, the bride walked down the elegant staircase from the second floor and onto the altar.  The ceremony was short and sweet.   The reception took place on the second floor, and the sun deck area served as a small dance floor.  We had some champagne and hor d'oeuvres there before dinner.  I noticed a lot of fuzz on the champagne glasses, maybe from the drying towel they used.   The dinner was delicious - we had some bread, salad, roast chicken breast, baked salmon, cheesecake, and chocolate truffle cake.  The plating was simple, but the food was satisfactory.  The service was a little slow, dinner was served an hour past the scheduled time, but that was to be expected at any weddings.   The restaurant was beautiful, and it was very convenient for everyone to attend the wedding ceremony and then eat and party all in one place.  We all had a great time and it was a memorable evening."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This was a tough choice between 2 and 3 stars for me, but because the food WAS actually delicious; I opted for the 3.  La Maquette is a place I've been wanting to go to since I started at GBC, since it's just a short walk from the college and has so many awards for \"most romantic restaurant in the city\" on display. It seemed like the perfect opportunity to go when a Groupon-like deal came up in 2010...  Fast forward to 2014 when I found the deal I had printed, noted that there was no expiry and made a reservation ASAP.  When I made the reservation I noted that we wouldn't be ordering off of the Winterlicious menu because we had the deal; they assured us it would be no problem. When we arrived, I again mentioned that we would like the full menu; the staff were very concerned and had to speak to the kitchen about what was actually available. It turns out the thing I wanted (quail) was not, but with a heavy heart I searched the menu for an alternative. We ended up with an appetizer (which of course I can't remember), and mains of salmon and bacon-wrapped scallops.   All the food was absolutely delicious; though it did take absolutely forever to come out. I wish they had told us it would be hard to accommodate orders off the regular menu; we could have easily come another time.   So keeping our delicious food in mind; here are the drawbacks (some are nit-picky, I can't help it):  - Decor: this place looks like it was probably the most romantic spot ever in the early 90s, and the decor hasn't been updated since. It's so olllllllld. Why are there so many china cabinets? It's weird. Your table cloths are yellow. Update.  - Service: certainly sub-par. It was slow, they never came by refill water unless we flagged them down; and they all had an annoyed look on their face - Set-up: we happened to be sitting in the sweet-spot downstairs where you can hear the main floor live musician AND the upstairs musician - an acoustically strange experience  - Water jug: I already mentioned that they didn't come by to fill up water; but when they did, the water was in one of those plastic beer pitchers. It just doesn't fit!    So overall, what do I think? I think if I wanted to go somewhere nice with my grandparents I would suggest La Maquette. But otherwise, there is too much else to experience in the city for me to come back any time soon."}
{"text":"Slow service, average food. 5 stars for the amazing acoustic guitar player, but  0 stars for the slow service . I went here tonight for the first and last time. You can have a great location, ambiance,  and a clean restaurant, but when you walk into a place at 6pm and leave at 9pm and only had one appetizer, a main course and desert, you know the service is SLOW...If you have to catch a game, music event or party right after your dinner do not come here, because you will be late for your event. If you are retired or rich and have  time to burn, then you may want to consider coming here. Like many Yelper's it pains me to give out one and two star reviews, but for me I write and rate my reviews based on the complete dining experience. With a focus on faster service and adding a little more 'wow factor' to the appetizers and main courses, this restaurant could easily hit 4 or 5 stars consistently in customer reviews."}
{"text":"I really really really want to love La Maquette.  The restaurant is so pretty and the wait staff are lovely but the food is just good, not great.    I came here with a group of coworkers today for a holiday lunch.    I ordered the mushroom strudel as an appetizer and really enjoyed it but it didn't blow me away.  The presentation was very nice.  We ordered a calamari to share and it was very good.  My coworkers had the romaine salad (good), the avocado and tomato salad (also good) and the soup of the day (very good).    As my main I had the sirloin.  A little heavy for lunch I know but I really felt like steak.  I asked for it medium and it definitely was not medium.  It was closer to medium well and while it was decent and it was not great or even very good.  I left over half of it but ate all the veggies and mini potatoes on my plate.  My coworkers ordered the tilapia (which I tried) and it was quite tasty.  I was also told that the duck confit risotto was good as was the ravioli.  However, no one raved about their food.    For dessert the waiter recommended the poached pear.  It was beautifully presented and came warm, covered in dough and served with chocolate sauce and caramel ice cream.  Quite sweet and good.  My coworkers had the creme brule which they seemed to enjoy and one of them ordered the citrus cheesecake.  It was light and tasty.    I have been to this restaurant at least 4-5 times over the last 5-6 years but I was a little disappointed with the food this time around.  The competition in the neighbourhood is quite fierce.  The restaurant, even at this busy time of year, was almost empty.  That speaks volumes."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here with a Travelzoo  coupon that we got as a gift, can't tell if the service was bad in general or if it's because we're using a coupon. The older waiter had no smile and didn't say much, but I saw him holding a jacket for a lady on her way out, perhaps he received a huge tip from that couple?   Decor is an older style, candle lit and 'old' elegant, almost thought we were underdressed when we first walked in. There was a guitarist playing by the front entrance, but he soon went upstairs and was never seen again for the remainder of our meal.   The food was surprisingly good though and price is not over the top, I would consider giving it a second chance someday."}
{"text":"4.9  I went during Summerlicious. Perhaps they did major efforts because of that, which would even be more commendable as compared to other places in which they downgrade their offered menu during such popular events.  From A to Y, everything was perfect. On Friday and Saturday nights, there is a piano and 2 jazzy very good singers. Cocktails are good. Dinner menu was really good and every thing was tasty, well prepared, well cooked, almost fabulous! I really enjoyed my dinner. Waiters and staff were really nice and always with a smile.  Why not 5... because I have to go back outside Sumerlicious to see whether quality is constant and whether I can have even more in my plate."}
{"text":"$25 set course was great!  It was quite empty on Monday and service was lovely.  Not as attentive as a fine upscale restaurant should be as it was what they were going for and food is not at that level but it was still better value than Jack Astors or any bars.  The view of the park was beautiful.  The four star was because the minute we walked in to the minute we walked out the service was outstanding!  The food was good but it definitely was not the best quality.  Had the vegetable soup with meatball which was good, came with two mini matzo meatballs and a tad on the salty side for me.  The lamb Osso Bucco is where you can tell if the meat was sourced from a quality butcher, overall the flavour of the dish was decent I can tell the lamb was not the best.  Dessert was a pumpkin brûlée and this blew my mind!!! It was really good!  The combination of pumpkin and creme were delicious (considering I never liked anything pumpkin except for the roasted seeds)!  Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Foie gras was cooked properly.The rack of lambs was stunning. very juicy and good portions. Wasn't a fan of the duck although i do love the french dish i couldn't pin point why i was turned off by it. over cooked perhaps maybe a little too dried out.  romantic setting not really for casual dinning. some high end decent wines mixed in with some crap wines but doesn't appear they put much thought in picking them. not overy attenative and knowledgable but friendly staff,"}
{"text":"Price fix menu was well prepared and generous in portion size. Good selection of wine and well priced. Service was attentive and not overbearing. Satisfied on all levels. Ambience and decor spot on. There were no misses on this night and all the boxes ticked nicely."}
{"text":"So... after my bad experience with the whole voucher expiry issue...I did end up going in the end because the owner Ange was kind enough to extend my voucher for a month. And to make up for this bad experience, she increased the amount of the voucher from $60 to $100. I do want to thank her for making this accommodation...  Now onto the food...  Speciality wild mushroom strudel ($16) with leek and spinach cream sauce- the presentation was beautiful! But unfortunately, the plate didn't arrive hot enough. The sauce, although very tasty, was already cold and seemingly congealed. The pastry was also lukewarm, but the flavours of the mushrooms were admittedly bold and delicious. Sadly, the temperature ruined what could've been a great appetizer.  Pan-seared scallops ($34) with creamy roasted asparagus risotto, red caviar, and cream sauce. In general, this was well-executed, and I was reasonably pleased with my plate of food. My only real complaint was that the scallops were slightly overcooked. The seafood cream sauce was delectable, but it also made the risotto exceedingly rich. I became very full from all the cream after a short while.  Roasted Muscovy duck breast ($36) with blackberry and apple reduction and sweet potato- now this was a complete disaster! The duck was extremely undercooked, to the point where we couldn't cut through the meat with our knife. And worse of all, it tasted like rubbery, raw beef! The sweet potato fries were blackened and charred, resulting in an unpleasant bitterness. In the end, we packed most of it home. The duck became more edible after my mom rinsed off all the spices and cooked it some more.   For desserts, I figured that it was hard to go wrong with a traditional crème brûlée ($12), which was supposedly garnished with fresh fruit and a cookie (the cookie was nowhere in sight). However, I was wrong! The brûlée top was so incredibly thick that I had difficulty breaking through the top with my spoon! It was actually hurting my teeth to chew through that thick layer of sugar crust, so in the end I just ate all the custard underneath.   In summary, the food was underwhelming, to say the least. I don't think my mom will order duck breast ever again at a restaurant after this experience. However, the restaurant itself was quite lovely, and the service was generally good, albeit a little slow. That said, I probably won't be returning any time soon, if ever again."}
{"text":"We went early on a Saturday evening. Service was attentive and knowledgeable. The food was  quite good, not quite excellent. We sat under the glass ovelrooking the courtyard. THe classical guitar was a bit loud but a very nice touch. We will definitely repeat."}
