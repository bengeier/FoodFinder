{"text":"I have been dining at this restaurant with my family since they opened nine years ago. My kids love eating here and we always feel welcomed like we are dining with family. We've been in the kitchen on more then one occasion and it has always been immaculate."}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza. Friendly service. BYOB although Rite Aid is right next door for beer and wine."}
{"text":"Such a shame... Their pizza is sooo good but the restaurant is sooooo gross and dirty ... Can you imagine what the kitchen looks like? No thanks."}
{"text":"Old reliable. Decent service and food, good value."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner at Mr.  G's.  We had the pizza special &  a garden salad. Pizza crust was really good and sauce was flavorful. I asked if I could have a side of their hand breaded eggplant and was accommodated.  The eggplant with marinara sauce was delicious. Service isn't super speedy,  but you are certainly treated well."}
{"text":"We tried their pizza delivery service and was very disappointed. No insulated bag so pizza was cold by the time we got it, crust was burnt, sauce was not that great and it was more cheese than pepperoni on their NY style pizza. I hope their in-restaurant food is much better than this."}
{"text":"Trust the fat lady on this one. BEST PIZZA EVER. Great service. Just go, you won't be sorrry."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I have raved about Mr. G's since they opened.  Their pizza is fantastic.  A little high priced, but still fantastic all the same.  However, I may have to go without Mr. G's because of the horrible service we have received the past few times we have dined in.  My son's requested Mr. G's for his birthday dinner, and we were happy to oblige.  We had a party of 10, which was no problem for them to seat, as we called ahead.  We ordered our pizza as soon as we sat down, because we knew from past experience that it could take a long time for pizza to come and we were starving.  Our drinks were not refilled timely, and when I asked for a refill I got all but a full on eye roll from who I think is the owner (female) and then a few minutes later I got a pitcher dropped off to the table.  I was ok with that, since they seemed KIND OF busy and I'd just rather have a drink than not.  After we finished our pizzas, we had no kind of clean up after.  None.  The trays remained on the table, the plates were piled high.  We tried to get our waitresses attention several times, but finally, my brother in law picked up all the trays, piled high, and brought them to the counter himself, so we could make way for my son to open his gifts and have cake.  Still no apologies for leaving dirty dishes, pans etc on the table and not coming around for refills.  Oh, and when the pizzas arrived, there were no spatulas to serve them with!    After present opening, we asked for a knife to cut cake and 10 small plates.  We were brought the items, after waiting a while, and served our cake.  I got the bill and lo and behold, there was a $5.00 PLATE FEE on there!!!!!  Noone told us that we would have to PAY for plates!  When we complained, the owner (I think) followed us out with a bully attitude and got very ignorant with my mother in law.  The customer service at Mr. G's SUCKS.  I will not ever dine in again!"}
{"text":"I've been twice.  Once on a slow night.  We had pizza, which what they are known for, and it was very good.   The second time was last night, a Sat.  It was very busy.  We waited for about 20 minutes.  If you had two ppl you would probably get in faster.  We had 3.  We took advantage of the BYOB.   We all ordered pasta dishes.  I had the sausage and peppers, the wedding soup.  My dad and I ordered this.  Our soup came out lukewarm, and we sent it back to get nuked. The soup,is great, but the temp. not.  Also, our sausage and peppers were also lukewarm.  We just ate it, since the waitress never came back to ask, until the end of meal to give us boxes.  We had also asked for cheese, and she just plum forgot.  She did seem very over-assigned  on her tables though.     We vrought red wine for BYO and we were given three platic champagne flutes to drink out of...funny!  Oh well, we didn't pay any corkage, so what do you want for nothing! LOL!  My mom had the chx parm.  Her dish seemed hot and good.  My mom is usually the complainer of the bunch, so since she didn't complain, it must have been good.   If I go back, I will only venture to order the pizaz, but I'm reading pizza posting here that its gone downhill. BTW, Not a big sweet sauce person."}
{"text":"this place is hit or miss. we ordered take out and it was wrong. we ordered 1 pizza and it was not what we were told it was. so i ordered another  pizza i wanted a thick crust pizza and the  dope at the register  said 45min.  so i when back and it was wrong too.   this place does not care about the customers all they care is the money and the turn around.  i gave them back there wrong pizza and will never go there again. the worst part is he tried to give me a pc of cheese cake to make up for the 70 dollars i already spent. they are a bunch of scam artist  with pizza sauce .   good riddance.  hope they enjoyed the pizza i bought them and i hope the c@%&Ã·d on it."}
{"text":"The sauce is way too sweet. I know some of their customers like it that way, but it'd be great if there were an alternative sauce on the menu for customers who want a more authentic Italy or New York experience. I live right around the corner from this place and never ever go, not even when they have a super cheap carryout special. It's not awful, just not the type of pizza or pasta I like to eat."}
{"text":"Very poor business. My wife is out of town with my 12 and 8 year old children.  Figured she would support a local business instead of a chain.  The pizza and bread sticks took around 1 hour and 45 minutes to delivery to the hotel that is less than 2 miles away.  My wife called them after and hour and they said they did not have the room number or a phone number so they did not know who to take it to ( she was in the lobby waiting). The driver took the pizza back to the store without going into the lobby to ask. ( owner said they called the front desk), so they said they would warm it up and throw in a dessert.  When the pizza and bread sticks arrived they had 1 small piece of chocolate cake.  The pizza tastes like rubber, as it should after being ran around and reheated, the bread sticks were cold and the cake was enough for both kids to take 2 bites.  I was not there but I called the place and got to speak to the owner, I asked him nicely to just credit the order.  He said they do not do business that way and that my wife should have given them a phone number and room number.  I said did you employee ask for either of them?  He said we were busy, she probably forgot.  Hmm sounds like a procedure on their part was not followed.  He said they would not credit the food but would bring another pizza out, it is now 10 pm, the kids were grabbing some snacks from the front desk so they could get to bed.  I told him We would have to agree to disagree, oh did I mention he was the owner.  It was a $22 order, any good business man would have refunded the order.  I am not worried about the $22, it's the principal.......   Hoping he can learn a lesson from this post and not let it happen to another family or at least do the right thing next time! Disappointing!"}
{"text":"We took the food to go. Their sauce and dough is awesome!!! Tastes so, so good. They made a mistake on our pizza and fixed it right away."}
{"text":"Lots of people have suggested I should try Mr. G's, so the other night as I was driving past I realized a had a coupon for half off a large, two item pizza. Now I knew going in that their large was 18 inches, much more than I could eat, but pizza is one of those foods that is always good the next day, so what the heck!  I ordered, choosing pepperoni and onions as the toppings, waited 20 minutes, and drove home. My cost, using the half off coupon, was $8.75. This ended up being my deal of the month! The pizza measured in at 17 to 18 inches in diameter and was covered with a very generous and quite tasty layer of cheese. The crust was a minimum of 1/2 inch in depth, about average for regular pizza, and I counted 50 slices of pepperoni on top. The edge crust, about which I am about to rave, was from 1/2 to 3/4 inches wide.  As I already mentioned, the cheese was delicious and plentiful. I would have preferred the pie to have been baked a little bit longer until the pepperoni began to crisp up. But I am not sure that would be possible without overcooking, and ruining, the edge crust. You see, as I was finishing off the first massive slice (two slices filled me) and I got to the edge I fully expected to bite down on that typically dry, hard-as-a-rock, tasting-like-cardboard piece of crust that usually gets tossed after the first slice or two. Well Mr. G's has perfected the edge crust. It is fantastic. It has a nice crunch on the outside and a soft-as-a-pillow inside. So, baking even a few minutes longer could prove to be detrimental.  The pizza is great. I am a fan. I will return. The edge crust almost prompted me to move it up to five stars (a rating I reserve for the pizza that equals one I used to eat at a family-owned joint long ago in the Mahoning Valley that has long since closed). As it is, Mr. G's goes to the top of MY (current) list. Well done Mr. G's!"}
{"text":"What a great find. This is what real pizza tastes like! No more pizza chains... only Mr. G's from now on."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. 4 stars.   Decent price for what you get. 3 stars.   Like the BYOB. 5 stars.   Rude service. I called in an order, and almost canceled. The girl taking the order was rude,  and very annoyed. I thought about canceling 3 times between trying to order and receiving food. Terrible service.   0 stars, negative stars.   Luckily, the food delivery was quick. 4 stars.   It'll be a long while before I go back."}
{"text":"I ordered the white, a canolli, and the bruschetta bread. The pizza was awesome, flavors were great, just be prepared with mints because there is plenty of fresh garlic. The canolli was creamy and the bruschetta bread was amazing!  I would definitely order from this place again if I could."}
{"text":"The service is wonderful. Great menu. The calzones are huge!  My one son loves them fried and my other son loves them baked, management is always willing to accommodate any special order.  My husband and I love the wings and always get a salad...SO GOOD! Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This used to be the best pizza around. Lately it has been inconsistent, the dining room is messy and full of boxes, and the food is just not as good as it was when they opened. The service we had was horrible and slow. I keep going because every now and then it is fabulous, but the other times it is simply mediocre."}
{"text":"After reading mostly positive reviews, I decided to place a delivery order.  I generally don't expect much from pizza joints outside of NY, but I had a long day of meetings and just wanted something quick and delivered.  Figured I'd go simple, cheese pizza and chicken parm.  Simple enough, right?  The pizza was what I would expect in Ohio, however...the chicken was not cooked...AT ALL.  I'm not taking somewhat undercooked, this was RAW CHICKEN. I generally don't post reviews, but this warranted one.  Upon calling and speaking to manager, I was asked if I would like a new order delivered...um, no.  Gave me a credit for my next order, which will never be used. Needless to say, the next time I am in the area for business, Mr. G's will not be on the menu!"}
{"text":"Don't do it. We have tried this place a few times but it's bad. Not sure why people like it but when we get pizza it tastes like cleaner for some reason. The crust is never baked all the way through as well.  Over all bad."}
{"text":"\"New York,  New York\" thin crust pizza was very doughy.  Expected crispy.  Very few pepperoni,  but it was flavorful.  Service was very good.  Ambiance was pretty good."}
{"text":"I just had the honor to meet Mike, the owners son, and he brought some food over to brubakers. Not only was he incredibly nice but also spoke about how their family believes in the tradition of making great food. When I am in Akron, this will be the place you can find me. Aaaaaaamaaaaazing."}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer of Mr. G's even have a meeting here with friends once a month. This place has never disappointed. The owners have become dear friends. The food is delicious and always comes out hot and promptly! Give the New York style pizza a try, I promise you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Order pizza last night late  we asked for it to be delivered to the hotel. It was huge pizza. It was a Greek veggie pizza that we added chicken to. It was delicious. We also had cannolis yum yum!  We hit the mark with this one."}
{"text":"Just had a craving for pizza and this was the next place on my list to try. I called and placed a pick up order, and was given a time of 20 min.  I decided to try the New York style pizza. When I arrived i was a few min early, so I paid and sat to wait. I was offered and drink, and ask specific questions about my pizzas, whether I would like to have it crispy or different. The staff was friendly even though seemed busy. I even heard them take a large order close to closing time.   I couldn't wait to eat my pizza on the way home, but I made it, and was not disappointed. The pizza was nice and crispy, and the dough tasted home-made. It had a nice sweet taste to it, soft and crispy on the bottom. The sauce could have been more flavorful for my liking, but it was still great. The cheese was just starting to be crispy, and the pepperoni was nice and crispy on top as well.   Overall, a great experience from beginning to end. I don't think there was anything that made it extraordinary, which is the only thing that kept it at 4 stars. But as I try more of the menu hopefully that will change! Bottom line is great pizza, great experience at a fair price."}
{"text":"Wings were good but the pizza was not so much arrived 1 hr and 45mins and was cold. So much sauce on the pizza and the cheese was just a thin layer all of it fell off. Crust was burnt and hard like cardboard. Never again."}
{"text":"I live in chicago and truly enjoy pizza places that have their own sauce, crust etc.  i never ever order or eat at the traditional chain pizza joints I was really surprised at how good the pizza is. At this place.  I Would absolutely get this again when I come back   I am a pizza snob as well, this place is really good.   Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"We recently moved to the area and tonight was our first time ordering pizza here. We wanted to try a local pizza place instead of a chain. Called another local place first that had a minimum order of 50 bucks for delivery. WTF? No thank you! Next call was to Mr Gs. Competent people on the phone. Pizza delivered at expected time. AWESOMELY friendly delivery guy. Tasty pizza with good quality cheese and not overly greasy. \"Medium\" pizzas were the size of a large at most other places. I felt bad this was initially our second choice... It'll definitely be our first from now on!!"}
{"text":"Friday night fish all you can eat, is mostly batter.  Don't waist your time."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place 5 stars.   Genuinely.   We went here regularly for quite some time. We would always order the NY style pizza. It was great. I know NYers will bitch of about pizza that isn't \"just like home\" and this is probably no exception. But we have been to NY, had Grimaldi's, John's, etc. In our opinion this was on par with the best we had ever had.  Then one day I had a bad experience with customer service. I placed an order for pickup and when I showed up a big woman at the front desk claimed my order was never placed. She insisted that she had been on the phone all day and that if my order was placed, she would know(insinuating what?? That I decided to show up and pretend that I just placed an order twenty minutes ago?...) It wouldn't have bothered me that much but her overall attitude was a bit much. We never returned. And it sucked. Such a hard decision to make.   But yeah, great pies."}
{"text":"There are plenty of Pizzerias in the Akron area. This is the best. I'm not comparing it to anything in NY, NJ or San Fran, but when I come home from traveling, this is where I order. They have a large menu, and sadly I cannot comment on most items, as I stick to just Pizzas, wings and their Cheeseburger Royale (my personal sub favorite that many may not love but is something I crave. Anytime you get a great sub with a cheeseburger and great deli meat on top, count me in). Their Pizza has a great sauce, and the crust is fantastic. When I worked in the area we went once a week for lunch and did the Steak Lovers pizza everytime and it was fantastic. The service, if you are decent to them, they are great to you. Just be a decent person and they will be amazing back. Overall, when I come home from traveling for work, I order my pizza from here, it may not be the crazy amazing Zitti pizza from NJ but it is by far the best pizza in the NE Ohio area, and I've tried a lot"}
{"text":"a large group of us (about 15 people) went to eat here to celebrate my husband's and my recent marriage a few days after xmas. we brought our own wine and ordered cheesy garlic bread, cheese fries, two pizzas and a few pasta dishes. the fries and cheesy bread came out pretty fast and tasted good. after that, we waited and waited. we had finished our wine. after an hour and a half of waiting, one couple had to leave without having eaten because it was their baby's bedtime. the waitress told us at that point that there was only one pizza cook and that they'd run out of regular bread so they had to make us garlic bread. she also told us one of our pizzas would be ready in two minutes. she came out with the pizza twenty minutes later, cold and erratically sliced. she gave us all plastic cartoon kiddie pizza slice plates, saying all the real plates were dirty. the gnocchi came out at the same time. it was terribly greasy with hard bits on the inside and we didn't even eat most of it. the garlic bread was really garlicky and soggy. the second pizza came out about ten minutes after the first. three pasta dishes were still not served. everyone was getting angry. my husband and I left at that point, and had upset stomachs for the rest of the night. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Pizza was very good..and really a lot of food! Salads are tasty. Disappointed there was no wine or beer, but you can bring your own in :)"}
{"text":"Like this place for homemade italian (meatballs, their own sauce) and I want to like the family style feel of it....but...every time I leave with a sour impression and its a long time before I return.  We were there on a weeknight and the place was filling up but their family members occupied two booths - so we sat at a small table near the door.  AVOID THE DOOR!  It was freezing, we ate with our coats on or over our laps, as did the other tables near us. When we were finished the owner had to go outside to find our waitress - smoking by the front door.  This is run like a pizza shop, not a restaurant. Cons: wait for your food is long, the service is friendly but not professional, the layout doesn't work (freezing by the door).  Pros: the food is good, everything is made in their kitchen and made to order."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the sausage and peppers on the weekend!  Also like the cheese on their house salad."}
{"text":"All about the sauce! I had never even heard of Mr G's until a friend brought it to an event yesterday. It smelled delicious and tasted even better. The sauce is sweet, garlicky and flavorful! Perfect complement to the giant al dente rigatoni.   If they use this sauce on the pizza it has to be amazing! Must go there and try other things ..."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST pizza in Summit County! When we want to sit down and enjoy New York thin crust style pizza this is where we go! HUGE pizzas, delicious flavors, great salads, pasta, and a fantastic wait staff! This is a good place for couples, families, or single patrons in a relaxed setting. Look in your entertainment book or Verizon Smart Rewards for coupons!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I ever had.  Whenever I am in the area, I request to eat here.    Everyone in my family agrees- this is the best pizza!  We think the key is the dough, but all ingredients are fresh and delicious. The sauce and dough have a hint of sweetness, and the mozzarella is always fresh (just taste it on the salads!).  We have never tried anything else except for the pizza, but then again, why would we??  An additional note - the restaurant does not serve alcohol but you can BYOB.  We have never done it, but see people do it often!"}
{"text":"Just dined in and was disappointed.  We have had their pizza before and  it is very good, but this time i got the fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp.  Server said it was awesome.  They clearly use precooked, frozen shrimp, as I could not bite through these as they were like rubber.  My wife got the eggplant Parmesan, which was very good.  The most aggravating thing is that they still charged me for my side salad...call me crazy but if have to send a whole meal back I think comping the salad is reasonable.  Do yourself a favor, get the pizza or something simple and order carry out."}
{"text":"I'm stunned there's just one review.  Mr. G's has THE BEST pizza in the area, no doubt about it.  I'm partial to the Sicilian and the New York pies, but I've never had a bad pie here yet.  Another star is on the kid menu, Keith's pasta- orechietti in 3 cheese and garlic sauce.  A giant bowl, so you won't feel bad pinching a few bites from your kid's dinner. Only two things to nitpick about.  Mr. G's can be a little slow in the kitchen-- ask your server and maybe think about an app if you're really hungry.  Also, because of the layout, on a cold day, whenever someone goes in or out the door, you can catch a serious draft if you're at one of the closer tables.  Those two things aside, you'll really enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Very good pizza! Very good! Great crust and awesome sauce! The only thing is it cost me 33.00 bucks for two mediums, which isn't the most expensive but it is a bit high...but in my opinon the pizza is worth it!"}
{"text":"We ended up going to this place after we found some coupons on Groupons - unfortunately, this seems to be the way we try out new places instead of Yelp.  I was unable to check out the restaurant, but I shall review the pizza.  The pizza is much better than anything from the major chains, that's for sure.  The sauce is sweet and unique.  It tastes much fresher than Pizza Hut, and is on par with Papa John's.  The cheese is thick and not as greasy as many people have come to expect from pizza places.  The meats are also good.  However, the crust can taste a bit like cardboard at times.  This still is a very good pizza.  I'd check it out if you're in the Fairlawn area."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town; Hawaiian is a fave!  Also love the chicken parmesan and potato gnocchi."}
{"text":"For the first time last night I tried Mister G's I've had almost every Pizza in town and this certainly is one of the very best I also like to support local family restaurants"}
{"text":"Mr. G's has some of the best pizza in town! We love the pepperoni pizza and the sausage pizza!! Whenever we do make it there, there is always a wait to get a table but it's worth the wait..! The wait for our food is also a little long just because there is a lot of people there too. Our waitress was very nice and helpful. but most of the time we order out so enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place used to be the only place where we got pizza in fairlawn but over the last few months the quality of the pizza and service have severely declined.  We got a pizza last week and half was cooked and the other half burned. It wasn't sliced and they had somehow gotten the order wrong. I called and they said next time we'll take care if you.   Well we braved it again this week. I called and placed the order and they said they would deliver it in a half hour. One hour later I called because it still hadn't come and they were surprised! It seems the order never went through. Half hour after that we got the pizza - and disappointingly it was again half cooked. I don't know what has happened but they need to seriously change the way they are doing business.   In the meantime, I have the dubious pleasure of finding good pizza in the fairlawn area. Wish me luck!"}
{"text":"I had Mr G's for the first time and was blown away by the excellent delivery service as well as the great pizza. I am from New Jersey and the New York Style pizza is just like pizza back home. The pizzas are a great size, the sauce is excellent, and the delivery driver was 4 minutes later than stated online, but he called to let me know he could be delayed. I have tried (no exaggeration) just about every pizza place in Akron, and Mr G's is my new favorite. I would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza and salad and picked it up to enjoy at home. The dough was incredibly sweet and something tasted \"off\" about the pizza. We both spent the entire night in the bathroom with horrible stomach pains. I'll spare you the details but we definitely won't be back again."}
{"text":"This stop was a spur of the moment and I was quite sorry we did.  We ordered the \"All-you-can-eat Fish dinner\" which was served with fries and coleslaw ($8.99) and Spaghetti Bolognese ($10.99) with a meatball ($1.50) which came with a side salad or soup (I chose the wedding soup) and bread (which I never got).  My soup was served first and it was tasty but it was not hot. The wedding soup was served lukewarm and I was concerned that the soup was not held at the proper safety temperature.  The entree was served shortly after on a very hot plate, unfortunately the food on the plate was merely warm and not hot. I was informed that their sauce and meatballs were \"homemade\" when I inquired. My food tasted just average and I am not sure I would order it again.   My partner's dinner was a little more problematic. Her fish appeared under-cooked (battered and deep fried) so she sent it back. Within minutes, her fish came back with a couple of small pieces missing. I don't think she was impressed with her dinner either.  I am pretty sure we won't be back to Mr G's soon.  Maybe we'll give it another shot in a year or so. I was disappointed with our dining experience here because I thought they would have better food than this."}
{"text":"I don't want to sound like a pizza snob but its been so hard to find a good pizza.  Being from Chicago, I've been spoiled...and no, I'm not a fan of Giordanos, Unos, or Gino's East.   Craving a pizza last weekend, I was excited to hear Mr G's delivered. The slices are hearty but the sauce is too sweet for my taste. I had one slice just to feed my hunger.  The garlic & sausage didn't do anything to improve the taste Sorry Mr G, you're not for me."}
{"text":"Great place to sit down and a family and get some fantastic pizza! New York style pizza was great and the service was friendly and top notch. Will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 large pizzas to split between 6 people and it was definitely enough! Pizza was great! We got extra cheese and pepperoni/bacon. Sauce is flavorful and has a bit of a bite, loved it! All I can comment on was the service, as it could be a little bit better. Our waitress didn't seem to listen/care very much to what we said and got our drink order completely wrong. Service wasn't great, but not bad enough to keep us from going back."}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan of Luigis...........then I stumbled onto Mr. G's .  Mr. G's can't be beat for authentic Italian Pizza And pasta ( I have yet to try their sandwiches).  Hands down, the best pizza in Cleveland/Akron area-the sauce is to die for!!! I can honestly say, I have never had better pizza.  It is a locally owned restaurant and you will often see the family working right along side the staff.  The pizzas are ernormous!  (especially compared to Luigi's pizzas).THey do not have their liquor license but they allow you to bring in your own wine and beer."}
{"text":"Love the pizza and the owner. Super friendly. If you order the New Yorker, takes a while, but it is a big pizza! Recommend the salads as well. Great spot!"}
{"text":"We've gone here about 10 times over the last 10 years (we live in the Cleveland area) and the pizza has been one of the best we've ever had every time.    I just can't understand the bad reviews, like the one about \"Campbell's soup\".   You need your taste buds examined.    The pizza crust is thin but not too thin.  The sauce is excellent - one of the best I've had.  We usually order the pepperoni & onion and it's top notch.  Last time we were there, while paying for another excellent Mr. G's pizza, the cook was standing nearby and asked us how our pizza was.   It's a very good thing when someone comes out of the kitchen and cares enough to ask and takes pride in what they're making.  Great job, Mr. G's!"}
{"text":"I AM IN LOVE WITH MR. G'S!  This place is absolutely amazing old world Italian. My son got the New York pizza, I got the chicken parmesan and my husband had the all you can eat fish. Everything was so delicious and they give you large portions. The prices are very reasonable and they even make homemade Italian donuts and cannoli's. If you like authentic fresh Italian food, you have to try this place. I promise you will never want to go back to Olive Garden or Luigi's. And make sure you try the appetizer garlic rolls."}
{"text":"I've always believed that even bad pizza is still pizza. This place has negated that saying for me. This was by far the worst pizza I've ever had in my life. Yelp is full of people saying that such and such food is \"the worst I've ever had\" but this truly is.   We ordered two large traditional pizzas: one with pepperoni and one with sausage and mushrooms.   So why did this pizza suck?  1. The dough was spongy and tasteless. It was like a blob of negative flavor in your mouth.  2. There was barely enough cheese to cover the pizza (ironically we ordered a salad and there was an abundance of cheese) 3. The sauce was WAY too sweet. Even after putting crushed red pepper and Parmesan cheese on it.  4. For $2.50/topping I would expect more than a few crumbles of sausage scattered around the pizza.   Basically every component of the pizza tasted bad or was done poorly. We ended up throwing away most of it and I HATE wasting food. Hopefully by writing this you choose somewhere else so that YOU don't end up wasting money and food too."}
{"text":"It's really hard to find a good gluten free pizza. Mr G's gluten free pizza is beyond fabulous and my husband loves the (not gluten free) sub sandwiches! This is will definitely be on our dinner delivery rotation."}
{"text":"Food is amazing but inconsistently so. Normally I would love to give 5 Stars for real NYC pies so far from the Big Apple. However if this place was in NYC it would be shut down by the health inspecors. Two clear reasons 1) the amount of dust dirt on all the walls and curtains and dusty cobwebs over where food is prepared. Dust is very thick more than a monthly build up. 2) The servers carry out food by the rim of the dish and glass not on a tray. It's disconcerting to have have a salad given to you with the lettuce sticking to their thumb as they set it down.  I want to give them a five but some routine cleaning up needs to happen first"}
{"text":"We just had dinner here on a recommendation that they had good gluten free pizza. When we arrived the woman that seated us, I am assuming she was one of the owners, told us that her grandson would be waiting on us and donating all of his tips to a charity. We thought that was great until we realized that he had no idea what he was doing and no one was helping him. I ordered the gluten free pizza and my husband ordered a medium deluxe pizza since that was the smallest size that pizza came in. When the pizzas finally arrived we were dissatisfied with the taste, or lack there of. The sauce was sweet and the regular pizza crust was soggy in the middle. The gluten free crust was good but it stopped there. We were disappointed in the food but especially the lack of customer service. We would not recommend this restaurant since there are other Italian restaurants that are much better. It's a shame since we would like to support local small businesses."}
{"text":"My family and I LOVE this place!! It is the best pizza I've ever had...can't say enough great things about the customer service, food and prices. This food is from scratch and it's BYOB - doesn't get much better than this!!"}
{"text":"This place is stellar. 100% out of this world pizza. Dough made fresh, not daily, but twice a day! Sauce too! Best pizza in town without a doubt. Service gets a 10/10. Friendly, punctual, comfortable and most of all very much service forward mentality. I don't think I'll get pizza anywhere else as long as I live here... I mean that. Just awesome"}
{"text":"This place is underrated. I lived in Akron for 2 years & this was my go-to spot for pizza.  Everytime I come back to town, I have to come by and get the Mr. G's House Fries. They are simple, but so delicious! The pizza is also fantastic! They don't skimp on the toppings."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best pizza I have ever had.  If you think it is good when you eat it there, get an extra large, take some home and have it the next day after you heat it in the oven.  It's even better!    Like others have mentioned, I wish the dining area was a little more up to date.  The wife and I usually have pizza about twice a month.  This evening, we decided to try Angelo's in Lakewood.  It was voted the best pizza in Cleveland for 2012.  While the dining room was much nicer at Angelo's, Mr. G's was our reigning pizza champion, and it still is."}
{"text":"Delivery Disaster ... again and again.,  On Monday I ordered delivery to a neraby hotel.  After an hour and twenty minutes, I called and was told the order had not gone out yet, but would soon.  And it did.  And the food was very good (veal parm).  On Wednesday at 4:30 PM ... I figured that I'd order again, and early. The nice lady said the food would be here in 45 minutes.    At 6:00 PM ... no food. So I called, and was told that that they had called me twice and got no answer (this is a lie) and that they forgot to write my room number down.   Okay, I was then careful to provide my telephone number again, and my room number, and was promised a call back when she found the status of my order.  At 6:30 PM ... no call and still no food after 2 hours!   Called back and Ron said there was a lot of confusion with another order, but that the driver should be here an minute with the order.   And he did arrive ... 5 minutes later.   Cold!  Are you kidding me?   This is the most ridiculous example of repeated incompetence that I've ever witnessed!"}
{"text":"Started with the hot wings. Delicious, big and meaty. 6 were good for 2 people. Side salad was heaping, didn't finish it. Had great shredded cheese. I had the ravioli, great size and portion. Sauce is slightly chunky, good consistency. Bread was warm with a thick crust. All in all, pretty good. Though the flavors were kinda of generic. Serves all tastes."}
{"text":"Food was better than average here and could have been a bit warmer when it came out.      Sausage and pepperoni pizza  Drink 4.99 6 medium wings"}
{"text":"This place was a great find.  It feels very local, and our waitress was very nice.  We ordered their original pizza which sits on a medium crust.  The crust itself was cooked evenly on the bottom and the edges.  The ingredients were fresh, and the sausage was spicy and delicious.  The price was fair for a 16\" pie, the two of us were stuffed after 2 slices!"}
{"text":"we love this local pizzeria and wing place.  great salads with real mozzarella cheese.  and the pizza New York Style.  ordered garlic twists and garlic bread while enjoying our wine that we get to bring here.  what?! .25 corkage fee??  great food and great service. somehow we always get Marcus and he definitely loves his job and is a fun  server"}
