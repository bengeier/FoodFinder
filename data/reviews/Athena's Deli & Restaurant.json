{"text":"This place is horrible. We went with my family on a Friday night. It was later (8pm) and the restaurant was not crowded at all, which we thought would be great.  We ordered an appetizer (soft pretzels) and they came out 45 minutes later with the food. They were burnt as well. Not good. The rest of the food was tasteless. I had the chicken whoopee which is a chicken salad sandwich with bacon, spinach, and tomato. The chicken salad was awful and tasteless as well as the rest of the sandwich. No one was happy with their meals, which include the fish fry, other sandwiches, and a salad.  The fries were the only thing that were any good.   The service was horrible as well. The waitress never refilled the drinks or came to the table to check on things.  She was socializing and did not seem to care. It took forever to get the food.   we will never return. There are plenty of local places in the area with much better food and service."}
{"text":"I agree with Grant W's review.  Athena's was very average food and service was not very friendly.  I was hoping for a great diner that we could take the kids and get a good meal for a fairly good price, but instead I got a below average meal, not very friendly service and a large bill (over $60 for 3 kids and 1 adult).  I was very dissapointed.  My son 's meal was very salty and uneatable. When it was mentioned to the server, she agreed it was salty, but never offered to replace the meal or take it off the bill.  When the cashier asked how everything was, again I tried to voice my dissatisfaction over our meal, but she turned her attention to someone else and never listened.  I will probably never return."}

{"text":"Ate here this morning...service was quick with drinks but slow with everything else..they were very nice & friendly though. All of our food was cold from the eggs to the bacon. The potatoes were so cold none of us ate them. There was a large piece of the egg shell in my eggs Benedict. The stuffed croissant was cold. Definitely will not be back!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately Athena's is under new ownership/management. They used to have the best Honey Fried Chicken - crisp outside, tender and moist inside. The best...until now. Visited last night - had about 5 tables of couples at 7:7/30. One waitress. Ordered hot pretzel as an appetizer - came fresh from the microwave, soggy. Ordered Honey Fried Chicken  - chicken was ok. Sides were lukewarm or cold. Salad was the dark green tops of the romaine, cucumber and two grape tomatoes.Salad dressing seemed watered down. Hamburger with fries - burger was charred so bad my daughter only ate the middle. Used to be a really great family place close to home - not so much now. Hope they get together."}
{"text":"Yummy food and laid back atmosphere. A little go to place close to home. An Avon Lake MUST! Get the fish & Chips!! It's a cozy little joint reminiscent of \"My Friends\" or \" Diannas\" in Cleveland. My old haunts..lol. 105.7 plays good music there and the wait staff is always pleasant. Ample parking. It's on a quiet corner in Avon Lake with minimal traffic. Oh, and their fries are double battered so they're like Rally's fries for those of you who know them..or, for us Fort Myers folk, they taste just like the lazy flamingo fries! The breaded shrooms and Onion rings are great too!"}
{"text":"Day 314: Athena's Deli and Restaurant: I couldn't tell you whether Athena's is really a deli. Actually, I must admit I'm not entirely sure what is it that allows an establishment to describe themselves as a deli. I mean, there's no counter space or meat display case to be found and the sit-down orders far outweigh the take-out. Perhaps it is the mere inclusion of a corned beef sandwich on the menu, and Athena's is quite decent. In any case, it introduced me to the Chicken Whoopee, and \"Chicken Salad, Bacon, Cheese, Spinach, and a Little Mustard on Toasted  Served With Chips, Cole Slaw, and a Pickle\" is one of the culinary proofs that Jesus loves us. But that's almost beside the point.    Athena's is a a restaurant that my family and I have been going to for many years. It has seen a lot of up and downs in both service and food quality, and maybe I wouldn't be so fond of it if it wasn't for how it feels like the local diner that is MY local diner, if that makes any sense. But for comfort food, you could do a lot worse."}
{"text":"Terrible food and service!  Waited 50 minutes for dinner!  Don't waste your money!  My parents we so unhappy"}
{"text":"Good amount of food for good prices.  I went before flying out of Cleveland last week and the amount of food I got was good enough for 2 people.  It reminds me of a little mom and pop sort of place.  The food is good and they had some new menu items if you're a regular.  Good service, nice staff and very clean.  A good place to go with family, small kids etc.  A good go to restaurant if I'm in the area again!"}
{"text":"Used to love this non-chain, family eatery. Now, the prices are very high, the last two times I was there, the food was not hot, slow wait staff. Disappointed with the down fall of this restaurant."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. Fish chips, nachos, salads. We had a variety of foods and all were excellent. It kind of looks like a Denny's but the food is much better. We met friends here as we were passing through town. The number of seats is the place is huge so don't be afraid to bring a crowd or maybe even host a party here."}
{"text":"Good was down home diner style and delicious! Though having to ask the waitress for everything made the service less than ideal but for the pie it may have been worth it. Until it was served ice cold...so overall good food...bad service"}
{"text":"This place isn't what it used to be. The help is unkempt and slow, food is ok. I've observed four couples walk out after being seated in the same day. Understaffed"}
{"text":"Great prices!!! Everything is close to or under 10 bucks. Great food, especially breakfast. Never left hungry or dissatisfied. Great variety as well."}
{"text":"Had pancakes, eggs, sausage and bacon for breakfast. Pancakes weren't that good, they had an odd texture to them. Eggs were cooked well and the bacon was crisp. Sausage was just okay. Coffee was good though."}
{"text":"Food was good, prices average decent service. Not the best service, was just okay. Dinner prices $8 to 15."}
{"text":"Great food great place to go with the entire family I've been eating their every other day for the past 11 years and it never gets old I love their pastas and soups and fries yumm I love it!!!  GIANT GYROS and know what else ???  Everything is fresh fresh fresh!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast go just about every week to our local restaurant.  I have never been there for anything other than breakfast never been disappointed. I have even had their biscuits and gravy and not been disappointed and that's really tough for me"}
{"text":"Had lunch at this restaurant & I am surprise at how nice the food came out & the portions is nice.  Service was fast even during peak lunch."}
{"text":"Food was decent..I was dying for some hummus though and was disappointed to not see any on the menu. Classic diner menu..."}
{"text":"Your typical diner with American dishes.  The service is usually pretty quick and they have good breakfasts.  Their soups and sandwiches are typically good; soups being home-made.  As far as their entrees, I've had better.  Many are a little tasteless."}
{"text":"I have been to Athena's a handful of times. My son loves this place! He especially loves the buckeye pie. The food made from scratch, the menu has a wide array of food. I haven't had a bad experience yet. The staff is extremely friendly, they know us by name and treat us like family. The prices are very good for the amount of food you get! So, please stop in and support Athena's!!"}
{"text":"I am shocked this place only has 1 review! I am also shocked that I JUST found out about it last weekend and have already been there twice since. This place is the perfect default meal when you want to eat out - really nice atmosphere, great food, interesting menu options, and pleasant service. It's a gem, I'm so glad we found it."}
{"text":"I will start off saying a really yummy place for breakfast, just stopped in for breakfast an i will be going back . There omelettes are delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Great local spot! Unpretentious with home cooked offerings! Bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"Chili and Greek-a-Dilla. Enough said. Simple, cheap and delicious...perfect for a weekend brunch with friends."}
