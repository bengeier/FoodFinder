{"text":"Good food but always with terrible service.  I keep coming back,  thinking it will be better,  but never is.  Carry out is no better,  as they forgot to even place my order in the 20 minutes I waited for it.  Best advice: don't be fooled,  and stay away."}
{"text":"I have been here 3~4 times recently and I enjoyed all the foods I had there so far. I especially like their pork dish and the large soup. The staffs are really nice and friendly too. I grew up in Korea when I was young and the food here I would say is pretty authentic. The foods are one the sweater side with lots of options so this place could be a good place to explore Korean cuisine if you haven't. 
I also have done some pick up orders and the entree portion is very generous that I can always make multiple meals out of it. When I went there with my friend, we ordered one appetizer and just one the pork main dish and that was more than enough portion for two of us (especially with the side dishes that come with). So the overall price is very reasonable, and knowing how expensive foods are around the capitol, that is a big plus for me. They also have really great lunch deals under 10 dollars with a good portion. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I went here with my family. In general, this place was alright. We had bulgogi and the spicy rice cake. The bulgogi was fine, perhaps a little too sweet, but good.

The spicy rice cake was disappointing. There was too much water to begin with, so it took forever to cook that all into the thick, spicy rice cake sauce. But more than that, the type of rice cake wasn't the correct kind for this dish. They used the rice cake used for soups, instead of the traditional long, cylindrical kind (Koreans NEVER make it with the thinly-sliced, soup one). That's fine, but they should have told their customers that they ran out and not to expect the proper kind. Even more than that, once we asked the waiter about it, the kitchen told him to say, \"this is always how we make it.\" I said that wasn't true because I had seen photos that other customers had posted from this restaurant, and those times it came out properly. They didn't have a response for that. 

While we were annoyed that they didn't tell us beforehand and didn't make it properly, more importantly, they acted in an unprofessional manner (lying to customers). Otherwise, I would've given them another star."}
{"text":"Yay! Finally some more Korean food options in Madison!

The lunch menu has the favorite dishes like bibimbap and bulgogi. You can also add bulgogi to the bibimbap!

I'll be going back for their dinner menu soon!"}
{"text":"I have been lucky enough to dine at Sol's a couple times when the owner was there. So the service has always been great.  My favorite is the spicy pork and the spicy tofu soup (hot pot).  Spicy pork has a lot of meat served on a hot plate, which is a good portion even for sharing.  Sol's menu is not a lot, but I like their \"home cooking\" style of dishes."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was slow, could use an extra pair of hands. Wished they had more KFC to offer :("}
{"text":"The food was mediocre and just too strong to an extent that I had a stomachache afterwards. We had a hotpot and it was too salty and spicy that I tried to ask the server for water to add into soup but he was nowhere in sight for 5 minutes. So instead I had to ask the manager who was nearby if we could get some water to put in the soup. The manager or the daughter who looked in her twenties said bluntly, \"Just put the water you are drinking.\" Eek. I was sharing the hotpot for 2 with my company. Horrible sense of hygiene if that is what she think is appropriate to say to the customer, not to mention rudeness. 
I told her gently that I would like to use new water as I am sharing the soup with a company. Yet she said \"Then you ask your server yourself\" and stormed inside to the kitchen. 
It was a very unpleasant experience I had and I have no intention of going back."}
{"text":"I've been back a few more times, the food is still excellent. As other Yelpers have mentioned they now have a full bar and a Tuesday night \"Korean Fried Chicken\" special. The servers are friendly but you can tell that when the place is full the kitchen can have trouble keeping up. Still highly recommended for authentic Korean food in Madison."}
{"text":"Sol's has amazing korean food.  Their korean beef is fantastic and the portions are very generous as well.  The staff there are very friendly.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service can be atrocious and the staff can be rather laissez-faire and unfriendly.  I think the staff could use a lot more training on how to be decent servers.

I think they need to try harder if they want to stay in business.  The food is OK if you've never had Korean food before.  If they want to cater to people that know Korean food, they need to be a bit more meticulous.  They should serve some basics that are normal in Korean restaurants, such as tea.  They should also have some Korean pancakes, better choices of side dishes.  The spicing and marinade is rather bland for Korean food.  I think they could ask the customer what level of spicing they would like."}
{"text":"Bad service....my friend and I waited way too long. We sat there for an hour. Even customers who came in after us got their orders way before us....our order is not that complicated to cook..I def don't see why it took so long. Finally our food came, but it's not what we expected. Average taste. The soup is basically from instant noodle package. Thumb down! Besides, when I asked for some paper napkins, the waitress gave me a poker face immediately...we also had to pour water ourselves. Bad service..I also seriously think the owner is racist. She always smiles at white people but is very impatient with other customers. I would say it is my worst dinning experience."}
{"text":"Love the new version of Sol's! Had the Bento box for lunch. so much variety and the best deal in town! Salad, chicken, rice, and sides for $8 nom."}
{"text":"I'm so thankful that Sol's exists, because without it downtown Madison would simply be a wasteland for authentic, homemade Korean food. (Sorry, Sujeo doesn't count.)

Everything I've tried so far here so far has been spot-on. Bibimbap is perfect (Pro tip: get it in a hot stone bowl, totally worth the extra $1), Korean BBQ entrees are delicious and generously portioned, and their spicy hot pots are are pretty much an all-out assault on your senses, in the best way possible. 

Other highlights:
1) Awesome free side dishes
2) Great beer/wine selection, surprisingly sophisticated cocktail menu, and of course Korean liquors like soju, makgeolli, etc
3) Friendly, efficient service
4) Korean fried chicken on Tuesdays... Amazing.

Their menu is pretty small, but then it's a small restaurant and I appreciate that they want to focus on a handful of items that they do exceptionally well, instead of spreading themselves out too thin trying to please everyone."}
{"text":"I thought the service, decor and beer selection was good. The meal we ordered was not. I shared the budae jjigae. If you love spam (hormel) this is the dish for you. It may be traditional to serve it, as a left over from when American troops were in Korea,  but I thought it was over the top with spam. 
I will try Sol's again but that dish was poorly executed in my mind."}
{"text":"The food is just fine; i had bibimbap. But the service is horrible! horrible! I was shock by how terrible their service was! and also they impose 18% of gratuity on the bill, which doesn't make sense at all. The environment just makes me not want to go again :("}
{"text":"Perfect. Food was great and service was perfect too. I had Gal-be jjim yesterday and it was so good that wants to go try other foods like Bu-dae jjigae. Best Korean restaurant in Madison."}
{"text":"They changed the owner a few months ago. I was pretty disappointed to be there again. The tables are not very clean, the food is nothing special."}
{"text":"This place is not perfect but it's still one of the best Korean restaurants I have been to since I moved to the US. 

Budae Jjigae is their strongest dish. It tastes better than in some Budae Jjigae restaurants in Seoul. Other soups except Galbitang are of very decent quality too. Their squid and pork stir-fried dishes are acceptable, definitely worth trying. Kimchi stir-fried rice is too salty and too oily and I assume it is because the owners tried too hard to satisfy American taste buds. Please don't. The authenticity is what matters.

Message to customers: I noticed people writing in their reviews that the food was too plain for them. The food is not plain. It is you consuming too much salty, MSG filled Chinese food that kills your taste buds. It takes a long time to get used to Korean food after eating so much salt for years. I'd been there too. I remember I even complained that Korean food is way too sweet and I salted my KIMCHI!! Luckily, after some time I started to appreciate the taste and discovered many wonderful flavours I had never tasted before. Korean food rocks.

Message to the restaurant: Your galbitang is terrible, maybe not boiled long enough or the meat is not good. Also, try to make your kimchi boggeumbap less greasy - what about adding cheese kimchi boggeumbap to your menu? People in Wisconsin would appreciate it. Good luck"}
{"text":"I really like this unpretentious and delicious new restaurant. I took my friend out there and we ordered the GalBi JJim for two people (32$). It was absolutely perfectly seasoned and cooked. Very delicious and the right size.

What sol could do better: 

Seeing the garbage and fluorescent light of the back really kills the decor in half the restaurant. 

The music could be better. 

The menu has a lot of value (good food and good prices) but it is hard to see that. I recommend simplifying the menu to one page and have the waiters answer more questions. Also adding some a la carte or sides that you can up sell will increase the perception of value and increase engagement and report with your great staff."}
{"text":"I agree completely with Calvin C's review from 10/1/2013. I went to lunch there the same day. I got the gimbap. It tasted fine (not great), and it was definitely way overpriced for what you get and how it is presented (very minimal). If they want to compete with other Asian lunch options on or near the square, they need to lower the prices and have a better presentation, on the plate and table AND with the overall look and feel (the disposable chopsticks were the sliver-giving kind). I also sat next to the window in a seat that was backed right up into the wall. It felt a little warm and stuffy in there as well. Overall, I feel the place needs a little more soul. Get rid of the beige and black color scheme. Put up some interesting pictures/art.

I am writing this review only because I want to see more authentic Asian restaurants in Madison-- and Korean food is awesome!"}
{"text":"Very bad service!!!! Avoid at all cost if you are Korean from out-of-town, and stopping by for a taste of home. Servers were only nice and accommodating to non-Koreans!! Menu items are not very diverse either. Our group had to wait 10 minutes BEFORE even be seated. Water was never refilled, and they brought out dishes in very weird order -- side dishes AFTER the main meal, etc. Not the best place if u expect any kind of service."}
{"text":"Food is so good!!!!!!!!! Will go there anytime if I can!!! Love Korean food so much and the soup I ordered is delicious. Also the ManDoo!"}
{"text":"mediocre, I believe the tase at five star bbq Korean restaurant (two blocks away) is better."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night to have dinner with two friends.  There were three tables ahead of us waiting to get in so we waited around half an hour before we got to sit down.  We decided to order immediately, since we had time to look at the menus already.  However, our order still took a long time to come (probably because it was busy).  We ordered bulgogi and budae jjigae to share amongst the three of us.  The budae jjigae was sooooo flavorful, and a little spicy (take this with a grain of salt, I have a VERY HIGH spice tolerance).  Definitely filled us up, and we didn't even finish the entire pot.  The bulgolgi was very flavorful as well, and the meat was very tender.  However, I wished the portion size was a little bigger.  The servers were being really nice about how busy it was, however, we sat down for at least ten minutes before anyone brought us water, which was a little disappointing.  Overall, great great food, but try to avoid busy times if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"I've been gone a while and just got back from a business trip to South Korea so my post here may be a little bias.  The location is great.  Literally downtown next to the square and is extremely close to any/all things near central Madison.  Once you walk into the restaurant you notice that they need to work on their ventilation system.  The air is thick and the smoke from the cooking fills the air which automatically made my friends and I cough.  You begin to get use to it after a few minutes but it'll leave a smell on your clothes for the rest of the day.

The menu is very good and there's a good variety to choose from.  The drink menu could use some work though.  Only 5 cocktails on the menu and the beer selection is pretty sparse.  One other thing to note is each dish comes with 4 sides.  You don't pick the sides.  They're all just the same and they come with your meal.  So kimchi, spiced cucumbers, sprouts and seasoned potatoes are what you'll get.  

Once we got the main course though it all came to a full circle for me.  I left South Korea a week ago and came home to a place that reminded me of the food that I left.  Very authentic dishes with fresh vegetables in each.  I wasn't disappointed with my choice.  The bulgolgi wasn't seasoned like I remembered from SK but I honestly preferred this restaurants seasoning over SK.  

All-in-all it was a legit Korean restaurant with a good variety of meals to choose from.  Again, the drink menu isn't that great but you can get drinks anywhere nearby, so go for the food because it's hard to come by good Korean food like this in Wisconsin."}
{"text":"We ordered the Ddeok Bokki (and received the Budae JJigae) hot pot, beef Bibimbap, and pork Bulgogi, for a total of $65 after tip. 

The hot pot is a family style pot of spicy goodness, with rice cakes, ramen, and sweet potato noodles along with slices of spam, ground seasoned beef, sausage and kimchi. It sits atop of a tabletop gas kerosene burner and is more than enough for two people. Don't be alarmed when it first arrives at your table, as the broth is clear, the spicy red chili paste is at the bottom, waiting to bubble up to the top. Not usually a fan of spam, but this dish will make you want to eat everything that's in the pot.

The pork bulgogi was a plate of chopped, seasoned pork, not what I was used to with New Seoul where it arrives as one solid strip of meat. It was a bit greasy, but deliciously seasoned nonetheless. 

We ordered the bibimbap in a hot stone bowl ($1 extra). It was very good with generous portions of sauteed vegetables, radish, and beef. They didn't skimp on the rice either.

Banchan that day was pickled radish, kimchi, daikon, and fish cakes - all refillable.

I am going to echo many reviews before me, although we did have a very friendly male waiter, but there was a female waitress that did not seem concerned with this  concept called 'customer service'. When we had been seated and ordered for 20 without water or banchan, we notified her and she just replied, \"yeah, you'll get it\"."}
{"text":"I hate writing negative reviews (if I'm eating out, I try to pre-screen places for quality based on reviews or reputation), but this place was new, I'm always looking for good authentic Asian food in Madison, and I was feeling Korean food.

Came for dinner. I had a really awkward seat... my guest and I had to sit almost touching knees on the window seat because there wasn't enough leg room and the back of her seat was right up against the guest behind her.

Interior decor is strange -- it's trying to be a bit classier than it is.

Food was very mediocre and overpriced.   I ordered the dduk galbi (basically a Korean version of salisbury steak) that was dry and lacking in flavor.  My friend's beef bul go gi was dry and tough. Banchan (kimchi and cucumber) were just OK.  Rice quality was mediocre.

The spinach namul small plate was $6 and I seriously only received 2-3 tablespoons.

For $12-$13 entrees you should expect much more decent quality in Madison.  I didn't try the galbijjim (fancier short rib) or the jigaes (stews).. I might give this place a second chance and try one of them.. or the bibimbap.. but it's really hard to mess up bibimbap... 

Service was very friendly and decently attentive considering the place is fairly new... too bad the food wasn't better...

Overall this is very \"home-style\" (nothing fancy) Korean food that is mediocre and overpriced in an atmosphere that doesn't quite fit.  They're new.. so maybe if the food improved in the coming weeks and prices went down a bit I'd give them another chance.  Maybe if I were here for lunch and had paid less I'd feel a bit better but the food was still weak regardless. For now if you want Korean food in Madison, New Seoul is better... or learn to cook Korean food at home... or drive to Chicago..."}
{"text":"I want to put more than 5 stars!!
They are serving really good, and their food is awesome!!! I really love to got this restaurant, and every week I miss their food. I feel like I should go every week to get their super super good food. There are great owner, he always with smiling. Also, server, I think they are student, but friendly and so kind! I think their food is real. I love it. 
Great service, great food!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here with high hopes thinking there's finally a good Korean restaurant in town.. And I must say that it was a yikey experience and I don't say that a lot. We got seated pretty much next to the doors and the wind was blowing so that didn't help.. We ordered green onion pancake which should have squid and clams in it.. Turns out it's literally 10 stalks of green onions cut into 5 inches in length and topped with 7 tiny shrimps and 3 thinly sliced squid pieces on the top.. There was no batter or anything and what happened to the clams that was supposed to be in it?? It did not look anything like Korean pancake I had at other Korean restaurant (see my pic for justice). Then we had bibimbap which had way too much rice and way too little toppings.. Another disappointment. I had bolgogi. It was okay. Nothing too special. Honestly.. If I have to make a Korean meal. I would have outdone the food I got here. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Budae Jigae, which was a hot pot with an amalgamation of sausages meat, ramen, noodles and all sorts of little vegetables. 

I have never heard of budae jigae before but apparently it used to be a dish soldiers made with whatever materials they could find, which eventually transformed into the delicious mess we had here.  

The budae jigae says it serves 2 on the menu but, it can definitely feed 3 people easy. As it was relatively chilly that night, the hot soup was a perfect way to warm your bodies up. 

Also, pricing for the food is also not too bad which is fantastic for gluttons like myself. Also,I absolutely love how big the portions are as I was very satisfied with the meal. 

Overall, if I went to wisconsin madison you could probably see me here all the time. I'd recommend anyone to check this place out and eat till your belly sings, because that's what happened to me."}
{"text":"What a great find this gem is!  My friend had her birthday dinner here and it was just divine.  I think the highlight of this place is their service.  They are speedy, accommodating, and do not miss a beat!  Our food was served piping hot as it was ready, no water glass ever hit the empty mark, and the staff all worked as a team to ensure prompt service.  

My only complaint is that the sweet potato noodle dish was drowning in sauce.  In the future, I would ask them to go light on the sauce for the one.  But their fried rice was SO YUMMY!!!  I'm salivating just thinking about it.  The calamari was cooked perfectly.  If you're not into spicy, I would advise passing on the kimchi they offer as an appetizer.  However, the sweet potato appetizer was amazing with the perfect touch of sweetness.

I can't wait to go back and try other dishes here!  I was particularly in awe of whatever dish they offer that involves a lit stovetop being delivered to your table.  It seemed like some sort of ramen dish?  I dunno.  Whatever it was, it was cool looking and I am definitely having that next time!"}
{"text":"I lived in Korea for 2 years and was excited to see another Korean restaurant finally open up in Madison.

First of all I have to say that other reviewers have been pretty harsh and seem to expect this restaurant to conform to some American standard of what they think Korean food should be. If you want Americanized food don't eat here. 

I have been to New Seoul and enjoy it though I do think Sol's is every bit as much as authentic as New Seoul. I have been here no less than 8 times since they opened and have tried a variety of dishes including the Dolsot Bibimbap (hot pot), Chapjae, ddeokbokki and Soondubu (Tofu Soup). They have been very accommodating about making non-meat options and substituting ingredients. That said Korean food is naturally full of meat--one thing I learned when I moved there. I don't believe that all restaurants that are specialty restaurants have to accommodate every single food fad or taste that people want. There are restaurants that I don't eat at in town because I know they are not things I can or would eat. Americans seem to expect everyone to cater to their needs all the time and if you're overly modifying a dish you aren't getting something authentic anyway.

Portions: Another American expectation for portions to be bigger than naturally healthy or eaten elsewhere. Yes, we are in America but Sol's portions are very sufficient for a satisfying meal without feeling stuffed. 

Prices: Very reasonable for downtown Madison unless you want to go to Korea and get bibimbap for $3.00.

Decor and Music: Korean restaurants in Korea are by nature a little cheesy and bland. And music as well. While I agree with other reviewers that these two things are maybe not what our standards of decor and music would be in a restaurant of this type they are very Korean. Authentically Korean. The space on the walls and the color of the paint bugs me every time I go but I laugh because I know it to be typically Korean and it reminds me of being in Korea as much as the food does. 

I'm not a drinker so can't comment on bar selections but my friend had a drink and said it was very weak. 

I give Sol's 5 stars for satisfying my craving for authentic Korean food and making me feel like I'm back in Korea every time I visit. I recommended Sol's for a full Korean dining experience.  Korean food is an acquired taste and unlike any other ethnic cuisine. Try to lose the expectations and just enjoy the experience of something different."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. I think it's probably the most consistent korean food in the Madison Area. A lot of places are good one day then iffy the next but sols seems to always be good. I love the galbi and all the side dishes are wonderful too. Also I find that the bibimbap here tends to be more flavorful than at other places. It is a bit pricey but then again korean food usually is."}
{"text":"My husband and I both ordered beef kalbi with lettuce wraps. We also had mandu as an appetizer. The kimchi was and samjang were so good we asked for more. It was also nice to have soju with the meal. It was worth every penny! We will definitely return!

The food was so good, we returned a second time. It is a two hour drive for us! This time my husband had kalbi and I had gamjatang. Everything was excellent. We especially liked the radish with jalapeño banchan!"}
{"text":"Our first time here. The foods are great, but......the service is not at all. I need a second bowl of rice. Neither of the severs had bothered to check hiw we're doing. After about 15 minutes of waiting, I had to raise my hand to get their attention."}
{"text":"Pretty solid overall experience at Sol's last week. Ordered the bibimbap w/crispy rice and the beef bulgogi. Both were ample portions and well seasoned. Loved the array of \"condiments\" they brought out with the meal. Two types of kimchi, fried squid, tofu, and some other veggies. Nice surprise. 
Only complaint was the stone bowl crispy rice could have been more crispy and more rice.
Would certainly go back."}
{"text":"I gave this place a second try after coming in shortly after their opening, and I think my first visit was the better experience. Maybe they added a few items, but it still feels like a relatively limited menu, just now they also serve cocktails, wine, and soju.

I've tried the bibimbap, bulgolgi, dukbokki, japchae, and two of their noodle soups. I feel like they used the right ingredients but the execution is a little disappointing. Almost everything I tasted, but especially the banchan, is too salty for me. Actually, the gimbap was okay. 

Finally, the seating arrangement can be crowded; either the layout is odd, or the acoustics are weird -- you can basically hear everyone else's conversation. If you're seated toward the back, the bussing station can get loud, I almost jumped out of my seat when they were putting away plates. Also, for some reason it was so chilly I almost felt like I had to keep my winter jacket on, even though I was eating hot soup. I wonder if they had a door open out back or just had the heat off?"}
{"text":"Sol's needs more lovin'

I came here for dinner last Friday, and arrived before all of my friends. The friendly host directed me towards the bar area, and told me I can relax while I wait for my friends.

The bar was surprisingly extensive, with a great list of cocktails unexpected from most Korean restaurants. There were no drink specials, but the bartender was willing to make most cocktails for $5 (normally they'd be $7).

I went with a Moscow Mule, which was light and sweet, yet with enough kick to wake me up from the cold.

When my friends arrived, we were promptly seated and given menus.

Our enthusiastic waitress explained any questions we had, and provided helpful feedback on most dishes..

My group got an order of gimbap (healthier sushi roll made with meat and eggs) with individual entrees.

I got their spicy pork bulgogi, which is a traditional Korean dish consisting of marinated meats over rice. 

Another popular option among my friends was their bibimbap, which is a mixture of rice, vegetables, sliced meat, and chili paste, usually with a fried egg on top (vegetarian options are available).

Our piping hot dishes were ready soon after, and we went to work devouring everything.

The gimbap was delicious, with enough pieces to go around and a dipping sauce for added flavor.

My bulgogi was extremely flavorful, with a layer of spiciness that's balanced out by the sweet, tender meat. The rice does a good job soaking up the sauces from the pork, and acts as a great buffer against the fiery spices. 

Our dishes also came with generous pieces of protein, and could easily satisfy a bunch of hungry, mature adults (lol). 

While the prices aren't exactly cheap by Madison standards, it's definitely fair for Korean food. ~$10-12 for an entree in a modern setting with friendly service? You will definitely be seeing me here again."}
{"text":"We tried out Sol on the Square last night. We were greeted at the door and seated immediately. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable. The drink menu included some excellent cocktails and beers in addition to a small selection of sakes. The menu is limited. A few dumplings for appetizers; bibimbap, bolgagi, and about four hot-pots with your choice of proteins. We tried the steamed dumplings, bibimbap, and bolgagi. The dumplings with the dipping sauce were tasty and there were plenty of them. The pork in the bolgagi is delicious. The flavors of the bibimbap were also tasty with a heat that kept rising the more you ate. These were accompanied by a relish tray of pickled cucumbers, daikon, a kimchi and something I'm guessing was soy. All of the flavors and textures were very good. We enjoyed Sol on the Square. Next time we want Korean food, we'll be back."}
{"text":"One of the best Korean so far in Madison!!!! I just came back eating authentic ramen from Seoul and this is not far behind. We had a special hot ramen bowl, kimchi pancake and rice and fish cake appetizer. Must visit for hot Korean food lovers."}
{"text":"After my travels in Korea, this is the real deal. It's nice to see a quality Korean restaurant downtown. The Mandoo are crisp and delicious. The spicy beef hotpot was made with succulent beef short rib. Just delicious. The bachan was fantastic. Kimchi is very good. Given the limited menu I was surprised that they were out of soft tofu for sundubu but we were happy with our dish. I think the ambiance needs a little upgrade.  It's a little dark. Lighting upgrade would help. The other change I would make is to offer single dish meals in case one in your party in vegetarian. Otherwise you're really limited on what to order."}
{"text":"To say I'm a fan of Korean food would be an understatement. There isn't much I wouldn't crawl over to get to a good batch of Kimchi, a steaming hot pot of Doengjang Jiggae, or some deliciously marinated Samgyeopsal grilling on a tabletop. 

I lived in Korea for a couple years, then worked in a Korean-section of NYC for a couple years after that, but neither of those things makes me an expert. No, not at all -- just a fan. And just when I was afraid my Korean palate would get rusty in Madison, I discovered Sol's.

What did I think Sol's got right? 
(1.) The Dol Sot (hot pot) Bibimbap was tasty and came with all the requisite veggies, beef, and Goochujang (red pepper paste) ready to be mixed in; (2.) My dining-mate's Pork Bulgogi was good, too, though it could have used some seaweed shavings and sesame seeds as garnish; (3.) Some diners near us had portable grills brought out for their BBQ; (4.) The waitstaff readily brought out more Ban Chan (side dishes) when I asked; (5.) Our waiter and waitress were polite, though a little over-eager to give us our check. 

What did I think Sol's missed the mark on? 
(1.) The menu didn't have a huge selection. Where's the Kimbop for example? I turned the menu over expecting to see something on the back, but it was only one small page; (2.) The Banchan (side dishes) all came on the same plate. I like all the little dishes littering the table the way you'd be served in a traditional Korean restaurant; (3.) The restaurant had an overly sanitized feel to it. Even in NYC's trendy Kimbap joints in Flushing and Koreatown, I get more of an authentic vibe. Where are the Soju ads on the walls?   

Would I go back to Sol's?
Yes, the caveat being that if a hole-in-the-wall Korean place complete with a middle-aged man or woman standing next to the window rolling Kimbap and throwing veggies in a deep fryer opened up downtown, I'd probably go there instead."}
{"text":"I went here with my fiance for dinner and drinks. We were not disappointed! Drink prices were reasonable, and they had soju and somaek on the menu as well! Soju was going for $2 a shot or $15 a bottle, and the somaek is a PBR with a shot of soju in it for $4. Delicious and a good deal for both options. Standard Wisconsin fare such as Spotted Cow was also on tap for around $5 a pint glass.

The food we had was excellent, and each order comes with four sides. These can easily be enjoyed before, after, or during your meal, and I felt that this was something that really set Sol's apart from other similar restaurants I have been to.

I had the spicy pork (Jeyuk Bokum), and my fiance had the bibimbap. Both of us really enjoyed our dishes. The spicy pork was at a good spice level by default, at least for me, but you are encouraged to ask for spice level modifications if you have preferences in that area. The bibimbap was very good, with all the standard ingredients in a large bowl. Very good!"}
{"text":"I ate here last night, and it was fine. I had the spicy chicken bulgogi, and it had a lot more heat than I expected. My dinner companion had the beef bulgogi. I tried some of the beef, and I liked it better than the chicken version. The beef was tangy, tender and not spicy.

While I did feel like $12 was a bit too much for the portion size, you do get starters with your meal. Of the starters, the spicy cucumber slices were the best. I would go back again just for more of those! The side salad was also very good. The menu is actually quite small, so don't expect a plethora of choices. 

Service was fine, and our food was delivered pretty fast. The beer selection is pretty limited, but a $5 Snake Hollow IPA is good enough for me. They also offer some mixed drink options.

Noise level was low, and I liked the plainness of the space. 

While I'd go back to try Sol's again, I was a bit underwhelmed. I definitely prefer New Seoul, one of Madison's only other Korean dining options."}
{"text":"I'm a Korean coming from the west coast and was excited to find that there was a Korean food place in Madison. I wanted so badly for this place to be good for lack of other options in the area. And even so, I was really disappointed.
I get the budae jjigae is for two but $32?!?!? This food was named literally \"military stew\" because of the cheap ingredients used from military bases to make it during Koreas food shortage. What's worse is the food wasn't even that great. Your best bet for quality Korean food is to go to Chicago or just make it yourself."}
{"text":"I visited the newest Korean restaurant entry in Madison with high expectations. Maybe too high for Madison. Maybe I'm being too hard in my reviews of Korean restaurants around here.

The service was good. Being a weekday night it was quiet. Food was good but not spectacular. The menu in my opinion was limited. The pahjun was not to my liking. The bulgogi and gimbop were good.

Overall, missing that something special... But for Madison, solid."}
{"text":"The menu has changed since last time I visited Sol's and I'm sorry to say it's for the worse.

They removed the Gimbap (Korean Sushi) and the option to have Bibimbap served in  a stone bowl (which was awesome when they had it). Both of these are sorely missed by me and my dining partners. We ended up ordering the Korean BBQ with spicy pork and Bibimbap with spicy chicken. Both were good but not amazing.

The night we ate there, the service was extremely slow despite the restaurant being almost empty.

Last time I ate at Sol's I would have given it 5 stars, this time it is getting 3 stars due to the menu changes and slow service."}
{"text":"Great location, friendly service and good food.  I was super excited about a new Korean restaurant that wasn't so far from my home as New Seoul (on the near west side).  It's a great location just off the square.  The dining area is nice with a great bar.  I got the beef BBQ which was good, but did not compare to the BBQ at New Seoul.  Some friends got the Bibimbap which looked delicious so I'm definitely getting that next time.  The biggest negative was that the restaurant was uncomfortably warm.  However, the service was great!  Overall, I'll definitely be back to try more of their menu, especially their drink menu."}
{"text":"I find other reviews complaining about the service to be very accurate.

Conclusion: Mediocre food, overpriced dishes, limited menu option, horrendous service

-When we asked about Bibim nang myun, the waitress dismissed us with a rude and simple answer. 
-The waitress ignored us (a table of 3 on a not-at-all-busy day) for 15 minutes, with crappy attitude. 
-We were thinking about leaving, but our adventurous friend decide that we should all give this place a chance, because this is our first time here. Okay. Sure. 
-The hot pot is a joke. Nothing more than korean hot sauce diluted in sugar water with some cheap kimchi and cup noodles. 
-At the end, the waitress complained out loud about crappy tips. I did not pay my hard earn money on my not-so-good day to be treated like crap. 

\"My first experience here is enough to tell me and recommend others to NEVER come back to this place anymore\""}
{"text":"Service is lacking. The host was rude to begin with, really annoyed about seating us at a bigger table even though we came in way past the dinner rush and there were multiple empty tables in the restaurant (at least half empty).

We took a while to decide on what we wanted to order and apparently that was fodder for laughing about customers in plain sight. I don't do well with open mocking.

Asked to speak with the manager and she never came. Had to ask again and was told it was \"her choice\" whether she came out or not. Everyone we spoke with has a slight attitude, as if asking for anything was absolutely ridiculous. She finally came out and told us she had no idea what was going on in the front of house. Was apologetic. Much appreciated.

Also, service has been lacking in the past. My water glass goes empty within the first 10 minutes and never gets refilled.

Limited menu. Menus are made of paper and come out all wrinkled (water damage)? Prices and exorbitant for the quality and food. Barely any side dishes (banchan).

I've been here multiple times and I'm sad to see the service is declining. Never has this kind of experience before! Maybe this combination of three young male servers in the front of house is not so great. Saddened."}
{"text":"Ordered Deokk Bokki. Waited for the hot pot to cook for about 15mins. It smelled great. I was happily getting started on my first bowl when my wife gasped in shock.

She had a piece of glass in her hand. Apparently she drank the soup and felt something hard and sharp in her mouth.

While the staff were apologetic, and said they wouldn't charge for the meal, how could anyone continue with the meal, knowing that there could be small pieces of glass in the soup?

Really shocking... The soup tasted nice (can't comment on food since I don manage to start on that) but the glass bit really left a bad aftertaste. Not sure I will ever go back again."}
{"text":"Their Sundubu-jjigae is soooooooo goooood
I really like this place.
Owner is always smile to us.
Service is good too."}
{"text":"Had such a pleasant experience visiting this restaurant during my stay in Madison, WI. The food came out quickly and it was delicious. We tried several items including bibimbap, GimBap and other dishes. I loved the little side pickled veggies, nice touch. I loved the service and the staff was really friendly. I would most definitely come back and try other items on the menu next time  on town."}
{"text":"We tried the ddeokbokki, bibimbap, and ddeok galbi.  The ddeokbokki was very spicy (that's a good thing), the bibimbap was good (it's almost impossible to mess it up), but the ddeok galbi really wasn't worth the menu price.  The menu described it as being cooked with their special sauce, which sounds like it would be really flavorful but it was pretty bland.

I still prefer New Seoul as the best and most authentic Korean food in Madison, but I'd go back to Sol's if I had a Korean craving and didn't feel like going all the way to New Seoul."}
{"text":"I came here last Friday with a friend. We arrived around 7 p.m., and the restaurant was pretty empty. Not a good sign, but it ended up being a great meal. 

Our waitress was friendly and our orders came quickly. I got spicy pork BBQ, and I thought it was quite good. I had only had Korean a few times before, so I guess I'm not the best judge, but I was impressed. The BBQ was indeed spicy but not so spicy as to take away from the flavor. The portion was generous and I had enough to save for lunch the next day. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stop by for lunch our first time at the restaurant.  We ordered the Chive ManDoo dumplings as a starter, thinking it was vegetarian (had pork in them-:(.

We ordered 3 lunch entrees Tofu bibimbap, and another bibimbap with spicy pork & extra beef bulgogi, and spicy squid bulgogi.  It was good but not 'wow' when I had better in DC, LA and Seoul.  Giving it a 3 star.  Our one suggestion base on what we ordered would be to add less rice in the bibimbap and more vegetables to balance it well. Overall, service was excellent, food was good.  Our lunch bill came to $59(not including tips) which includes 2Asian pear punch drinks."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great prices and delicious food. Very friendly service. I ordered the kimchi-tofu bowl and loved it. My boyfriend ordered short ribs and that was probably my favorite dish. We also ordered the seafood pancake for the table and I would definitely order that again; delicious!! I will be going back to try the bibimbap"}
{"text":"Honestly, somehow I had never eaten Korean food before. I'd tried kimchi, which is easy to come across because right now it seems to be trending in the food world, and I knew what bibimbap was, but somehow never actually got around to trying it sooner. 

I visited Sol's with a friend who is Korean in heritage and she helped walk me through my first experience. We both decided to order the beef bibimbap and I thought it was fantastic. The flavors blend well and every ingredient seems to complement the others. In my opinion, the egg was a bit overcooked and there was kind of an overwhelming amount of bean sprouts, but these issues did not detract from the overall experience. 

As others have mentioned, the one negative thing that did stand out was service. In general, our waitress was kind and attentive, but she brought us the check before my friend had even finished eating and we both got the impression that we were being ushered out. This wouldn't be so much of an issue had the restaurant been busy or experiencing a Friday dinner rush...but it wasn't. 

Apart from that,  I think the restaurant is very cute, the decor is trendy, and the wall paintings are really cool. My friend who is more familiar with Korean restaurants found the menu limited and the overall experience underwhelming, but I actually really enjoyed my first foray into Korean dining. 

I would definitely recommend this restaurant, but unfortunately cannot compare it to other local Korean restaurants due to lack of experience."}
{"text":"Dined in last week, got a bimbimbap, food arrived reasonably quick and taste great! Since I am not Korean I can't say whether it's authentic or not, but to me it taste pretty great! Although I could see service was on the lacking side, but waitress seemed trying their best. And for the price of $12 for dinner dish, I can't complain too much about the limited choices on the menu. Good experience general and will go back."}
{"text":"- Kuddos for taking reservations.
-  Really appreciate how close this is to the Bartell Theater.
- Simply laid out menu and photos help make choices.

However - the waiter was disorganized, didn't know the menu and had a very hard time managing the final bill. Yes, there was a bit of a language challenge, but I expect some bit of server competence regardless of language skills. 

Also, each of our meals was to come with the \"four sides to share.\" Of the five of us, we go ONE set of four until one in our party asked for a second set, and that arrived 10 minutes later. 

Food was tasty and I like the atmosphere. I'd come again before a show to at the Bartell, but probably not if I had my choice of going anywhere for Korean food."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner on a Saturday night.  Ordered the dumplings which were quite tasty.  Entrees were Korean BBQ (Pork) and Bibimbap (Chicken).  The BBQ was very good - ample spice.  The Bibimbap was good, but was lacking in the protein quantity and veggie quantity which was substituted for and occupied by white rice.  The heat level was good - but it would have been better with more veggies and protein and less white rice.  The restaurant was a little on the dirty side - menus had food residue on them, and some overall lacking in cleanliness.  I will say that our server was excellent and earned this place their 4th star.  She was attentive, but not overly so.  In short - it wasn't a great meal, but it wasn't a bad meal.  I think the verdict is out, but I would be happy to return to give it another shot to see if it wins me over or sends me packing."}
{"text":"This place has potential. The location is near the main Capitol Square and I was really craving some good Korean food, unfortunately this place has some work for improvement.

Walking inside, the decor is really confusing. If they took away their old holiday lights and bulbs, I think it would create a better less over stimulating interior.

The menu is simple, not many offerings so I decided on the Dolsot Bi Bim Bap & steamed Mandoo.

The waitress was a young girl and very nice & was quick with my water but didn't ask if I wanted anything else for a beverage.

The ban Chan was good, the Kim Cher was great.

My Bi Bim Bap came out first and then the mango came out later.

The rice bowl was good though the sunny side up egg was over cooked. The yolk was hard and didn't give me the golden gravy I so enjoy on a dish like this one.

The mandoo is such a disappointment. It tasted from and mushy, and it had a very strong chicken bouillon flavor. At first I thought it was the shoyu - so I tasted the soy sauce & I could immediately taste that it was Kikkoman. I tried a second dumpling and discovered it was the mandoo filling.

I told the waitress about and she told me the mandoo was frozen & not homemade & apologized for it but still left it on my tab. 

I know it's now her fault - but had I known it was frozen, I wouldn't have ordered it.

I don't recommend this place to eat at. If the Mandoo was frozen, I can imagine what else isn't authentic.

For the price they're charging, it really seems like they're taking too many shortcuts to their guests.

Enjoy.

:)"}
{"text":"After dining at Sujeo I was beginning to worry that there wasn't authentic Korean food in the area and luckily found Sol's on yelp! Thanks yelp!

As Joseph K says, I'm thankful for an actual Korean restaurant in the area (especially because I'm not a fan of Asian fusion foods) with FREE ban chan (side dishes). Although the side dishes were a meager portion during my visit, they had them... For free! And they were actually tasty! I am sad to see they no longer have the jajangmyeon (black bean noodles) which are my favorite so I decided to try their hot pots as they looked delicious in their pictures. And they were sooooo delicious! 

We ordered the Ddeok bokki hot pot thinking it was very strange to have the rice cake with ramen noodles in the dish but oddly it worked for me. They used the proper rice cake for this dish and it tasted as though they made it fresh so extra points for Sol's! It was a strange concept to have the hot pot cooking in front of us and not really knowing if we were cooking it or if our server was but we just left it alone and it all worked out as the server just came back as it was boiling and about ready. I can see where things can go wrong with the hot pot over boiling and thickening the soup to a sauce but that didn't happen to us and the hot pot was a perfect balance of being more like stew, thick, not thin and runny. I wish I had tried the more traditional dishes like the bulgogi but throughoutly enjoyed the spicy Ddeok bokki hot pot and even had the leftovers the next day.

Sol's is definitely refreshing given the lack of authentic Korean food in the area. I wish I could have tried out every place that claimed to serve Korean food but was happy with the food at Sol's that I didn't feel the need to venture out any further. If you love Korean food and have an open mind on their take of hot pots, definitely take the time to dine here. The service was good, not great, and the food quality was on point. I will definitely return to Sol's the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"So far the best Korean food I've ever. Eaten the Tuesday chicken is well worth waiting for the prices are Great"}
{"text":"So, I came back here last week, and now I have a much better grasp of the place. Sol's is a place to go to to get some good food, but you need to come with some precautions.

Both times I went, I had the same two dishes:  A cold spicy tofu, and the bibambop (sp?).  I think both ware very enjoyable if it's the kind of thing you're into.  The tofu was really hot, but the sauce it was covered in had a lot of flavor, so it was a good experience, but not for everyone.  The bibambop had a good melding of flavors that gave the dish a good texture, and the second time I went (but not the first), it had some good flavors as well..  My friend had a dish that was like sushi, but had some small differences.  He enjoyed it, and for what he paid it seemed well worth the price. My other friends had a sweet potato noodle small plate, and they both claimed to like it.

So, yes, the food is good, but that's not the entirety of a restaurant.  Service wise, they're fine, but could be better.  We got all of our food in a timely manner, the servers were nice, and they filled up my water often, but they were lacking in knowledge about what their dishes contain, which is a real problem.  This is a real problem because both times I went there, I ended up getting beef in my bibambop, and both times I requested it vegetarian.  The first time, I just said that I wanted it \"vegetarian\", and they ignored that.  The second time, I specifically said that I wanted it with kimchi, and the menu states that you can sub out the beef for kimchi for a dollar extra.  But again, I got beef (and kimchi).  It wasn't a huge issue, as I could take out the beef easily when it was served, but take note that Sol's is a very difficult restaurant for people with dietary restrictions.I was disappointed to find that the signature Korean BBQ dish had no vegetarian option (I feel like tofu would've been easy), and there were only a couple full vegetarian dishes overall.  It was annoying to feel that limited in an Eastern restaurant, as that's far from the norm in that type of place.  Finally, this isn't a complaint (because my party liked it), but i'll note that they have a very eccentric music selection for the place.  It rarely fits the vibe that the decorations give, and it's often like a tour of weird songs.

So i'm giving Sol's a 3, because while they have a lot of things nailed down (namely the food itself), they need to work on other aspects to make it a real destination for your dining experience."}
{"text":"Basically still 5 stars. Haven't been disappointed and the food is still great. Their drink menu is superb so don't miss out!"}
{"text":"I love stopping in here for lunch.  The service is efficient.  The prices are good. The food is healthy, tasty, and consistent.  I have no complaints here.  If you want good, family run, convenient, Korean food then this is the place to come."}
{"text":"Super upgrade with everything. Helps they have a bartender now. Sold out of KFC but getting me to come back!"}
{"text":"Great place. Nice selection of food, great beef dishes and the dumplings were the best I've ever had. Super affordable, especially for the capital area. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"As you read reviews, I hope you take into consideration Sol's only opened around September of 2013. With that, many of the earlier reviews were through a transitional phase that every restaurant goes through! The Sol family is always there running the restaurant and they have been working really hard to get their restaurant at a solid place. Many of the negative reviews on here rip on the decor/atmosphere. No lie-not the coolest or most innovative looking place, but Caribou looks like shit and has a fantastic burger so why don't we put those comments on the back burner and talk about the food, yeah? 

I eat here just about every week and just want to point out some basic highlights that took me a bit to find and you might really enjoy them if you're a novice in the world of Korean food like me. 

Bibimbap with bulgogi is a solid dinner choice with rice, some hot sauce an egg and pickles with spinach (getting it on a hot stone will keep that dish SCALDING hot the whole time). I love the spinach, but it comes in the bibimbap and runs $6 on the menu so I'd just go for the bibimbap. 
Japchae will be clear noodles with the bulgogi and some onions and peppers-the portion will be enough for one person's dinner. 
Gimbap is always a hit! and also just the bulgogi dish with rice is simple and delicious. Many of my friends love the spicy squid too. I am not the biggest fan of the Soondobu because it's pretty tame, but it will cure a hangover if you are in need. 
Tonkatsu will be one i'd be steer away from unless you don't want to do any of the pickles, or kimchi and want a super basic dish. It is tasty but this is one of the dishes you might be pissed about eating in a restaurant because it wouldnt be hard to make something similar at home (deep fried breaded pork with rice and a piece of shrimp)
GalBiJJim is a smart choice to split between two or three  for $32 it is a TON of food,i i'm talking a pile of short ribs in a sizzling hot pot with a big bowl of rice on the side. 

Hope this helps you get acquainted with Sol's menu! Definitely want this place to stick around with your support. If you're smart about ordering you can have a great meal there without doing too much damage on your wallet."}
{"text":"Sol's is a fabulous option for some good Asian food near the Capitol! We gave this place a try after being wowed by New Seoul a few months ago. This did not disappoint! Our service was average, but no mishaps. The bibimbap was fresh and delicious - only thing New Seoul did better was I got more chicken in mine there. Other than that, I would defer itself come back here to satisfy Korean food cravings and would highly recommend to students looking to venture out a little bit!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time on a Tuesday evening for a business dinner.  The place was not crowded and the Korean music was very good.  I had the Sujo Sour as my drink for the evening and it was GOOOOOOD!  Love the DDeok BoKKi Hot Pot with the Noodles and Rice Cake in  Sweet Gochujang Sauce.  We ordered Korean BBQ - 2 plates of Beef, 1 chicken and 1 pork and for 4 people that was too much.  We might have been good with just 1 plate of Beef and perhaps Pork --- I thought the Chicken was a little on the dry side.  My only complaint is that we ordered 4 plates of BBQ - they could have provided 4 plates of Lettuce and Seasame Seed leaves (they provided 2 plates and after that said they did not have anymore lettuce leaves to refill)."}
{"text":"The spicy pork and kimchi bibimbap is to die for!  I kind of wish they had more variety though.  The hot pot soups are ginormous and could probably feed a group of six, even though the menu states a group of four.  It's a bit of a squeeze in this joint, but the staff are nice and friendly.  Also great location off the square to bounce off and do other things like checking out the farmers market or children's museum."}
{"text":"It's probably lame of me, but I can't remember the names of any of the dishes we had except for my friends' \"spicy chicken\" which was a simple one- good chicken and good rice! I had a bowl of udon noodles with fish cake, calamari, and stuffed tofu. It was definitely one of the more adventurous dishes I've had in Madison, considering I've JUST started liking fish and am trying to expand my horizons. How can I become a foodie if I'm scared of fish texture?! :) So the dish was pretty good, although it was hard to eat because the noodles were slippery and the broth was SO hot! My friend got some roll thing that he enjoyed. The pickled appetizers were out there for me, but tasty! If you love spicy foods, I would totally recommend this restaurant. If not, be careful what you pick!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of rice- but the BiBimBap was delicious! The sides that come with the rice are packed with great flavor!  P.S. it still comes in the stone bowl if you ask for it. The menu does not have too many options, though. 

Good service, we asked her to recommend some dishes, and we loved what we got! We were here on a friday afternoon, and there was plenty of seating- but that's no surprise, the place is relatively new. Judging off the previous reviews, this is an improvement from the past. 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Buddae Jiggae is large enough to share for 6 people or so. I had three in my party and we were stuffed! Also ordered the rice cakes which were cooked a little too long and were very chewy, but had great sauce and flavor! If you like spice, you'll like this dish! 

Service was very nice demeanor and flexible with us! Setting up a table when we thought we had 8 people coming but then were not upset when our number was changed."}
{"text":"I'm out of town-er from Chicago, a city which has more population than Madison, thus one might assume probably more Korean restaurants. However, you'll be surprised of how little Korean restaurants there are that cater to non-Koreans.

With this experience I have with Korean restaurants, I found this one in Madison to be filled with surprises. It certainly sticks to its authenticity, but managed to gear towards non-Korean crowd with selection of menus that are friendly but not so easy to get by. Believe me, I've seen so many dishes served in Korean restaurants that are too sweet, salty, or spicy just to cover their lack of depth in flavor. 

I tried boodae jiggae (not sure if I spelled that correctly) whose broth was rich with excellent proportions of ingredients. I could taste seafood in there which might have been the base broth, but I could be wrong. Another dish I tried was spicy squid bulgogi, which I normally deter from ordering but my friend insisted on getting it. I was glad I did, and definitely was Bab Dodook - a term used when the dish is so good you keep on eating it with rice nonstop - its literal translation is \"rice thief.\"

I gave 4 stars due to some of its limits - I think it can improve on decorations and overall ambiance as it progresses and menu can expand - find its specialty since I think the menus are fairly parsed out in terms of category. I loved the 'on the doma' theme and crave to see more of it!"}
{"text":"I've actually been here a bunch entirely to get the bibimbap. It's definitely the best in town, especially since you can get it in a hot stone bowl! Service is vey spotty, the waiters we had were almost too attentive at times and then hard to get their attention at others. 

Their drinks really need to improve though. My friend ordered a cocktail which was so bad he could finish it, and switched to just getting a beer instead. And the beers weren't even cold, but almost luke warm.

Overall, I like the good and think it's probably a more authentic place but the service needs to improve. We were the only ones in there on a Friday night, which makes me think the place is short lived."}
{"text":"Like the rating says, it was just OK.  The housemade pan fried dumplings had a great tasting filling but came off being a little too greasy for my taste.  Bulgogi was acceptable, nothing earth shattering.  I also tried a spicy seafood soup special that came with shrimp, clams, and mussels.  While the broth definitely had a great umami taste and spiciness, I was put off by the 5-6 unopened mussels that remained in the soup.  This not only questions the freshness of the ingredients but also the attentiveness of the kitchen as they should have been removed before serving.

Another annoyance is that as of last week, they just received their liquor license but still not serving beer (only cocktails).  Hard to wash down the food drinking a cosmopolitan or a gin rickey."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The actual food is pretty good but there are several other things which frustrate me and have made me give this place a 3. Things that are fixable so hopefully this relatively new restaurant can only get better.

I believe they are understaffed. My party of 6 were not really greeted, we waited at the bar for about 10 mins, were not asked what we wanted for drinks as we wait. Grabbing their attention was difficult bit we managed to get drinks. Our waitress was friendly but got crabbier as the night progressed, probably from being overworked.

Their menu seems very limited. Most Korean restaurants offer 2 to 3x as much for options. Korean cuisine uses a lot of similar ingredients for various dishes so I can't imagine it hard to at least expand a little.

We ordered the jap chae for an appetizer which was pretty tasty. However our scallion pancake was really strange. Nothing like a pancake at all! Would you like some batter with your scallions? We were literally eating just stalks of it with a sprinkle of batter. I prefer not to eat that much onion at once and don't think they should call this a pancake at all. Also their bulgogi looks awkward with the rice served next to the meat on the sizzling plate. Traditionally it is served separately on a bowl. 

I got the bibimbap was what I got and it tasted it fine. Most things tasted good I just think there are other aspects that they could improve."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night and the restaurant was full, but no wait. The waitress was VERY friendly and helpful with the menu. I had the bibimbap with spicy chicken and it was great and.....spicy! I can handle some spice and it was delicious, but I think next time I'll go with the (not so spicy) beef. I like that the menu is relatively small and full of classic Korean dishes that are tasty and fairly inexpensive. Try it!!"}
{"text":"When I walked in the door I was initially unimpressed. I asked two different servers whether there were any vegan options and nobody seemed to have any clue. Finally a manager passed on the word that the BiBimBap could be made vegan and we decided to grab a table and stay for dinner.

The food was very, very good. Ben got the spicy noodle bowl and I got the BiBimBap rice bowl which came with kim chi, seaweed, pickled cucumbers, and a really tasty spicy sauce. Everything was HOT, but we were both members of the clean plate club at the end of the meal.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I find this place to be very comforting. On a chilly day, you walk in and the warm, Asian barbecue smell wraps you in a cozy cocoon of enticing scents. The service has been kind and competent, and I like the small, familiar space. Personally, I don't mind a small menu, either. Do a select set of things you do well, and I'll be back for more. I've heard people complain that you can only have a few things there; I didn't find it to be a limiting selection at all, just the Korean classics you would expect.

My first time, I went with my sister as part of a weekend of Asian food-crawling. We had the ddeokbokki and then shared a hot-pot.  This was probably a mistake, because it was a LOT of food. (See photo) The price made me think the two of us Midwestern girls could put that away easily. WRONG. We did pretty good justice to it, but it was too much.   The ddeokbokki was delightfully springy and just the right amount of chewy, the spicy barbecue sauce paired well with the mix of pickled accouterments provided. The fish cakes that come along traditionally with ddeokbokki were not mind blowing, but also good. A little flat, perhaps. 

The Hot Pot arrived as we were eating a little kimchi sampler (banchan) and putting down the delicious ddeokbokki while slamming their Asian pear punch.  (The punch, while delicious and refreshing, is very weak as far as alcohol content, not much of a punch to the punch, if you will. But that means you can have 4 of them and still walk a straight line home.) The mini stove apparatus took up almost the entire table for two, which immediately tipped us off that it was going to be a lot of food. The server kindly offered to move the table next to us over to give us more space, but we saw that they were busy and didn't want to take up a table just to be gluttonous monsters.

Thankfully it was apparent that the staff knew how to time out the hot pot, since we obviously knew nothing of what was expected of us when served this item. The server instructed us to ignore it for a good bit  while it came to a boil, and that they would be back to serve us.   After about 10 minutes we had finished our appetizers and were staring longingly into the depths of the beckoning hot pot. It smelled so good... we began to debate if we had been forgotten? It was boiling... should we stop it? What if it's overcooking?  We began to fret, and started picking bits off the top. Eventually a different server came by to let us know that is was \"almost done\" now that it had come to a full boil, and should be left for another 5 minutes or so to thicken.  D'oh!  We should have known better than to eat it before the waitress returned. She was right, it was better after she came to check it, stir it, and then wait for it to cool down some and become thick, saucy, and less brothy.  It was amazing.  I definitely noticed a few patrons staring at our massive stovetop of deliciousness. Their jealousy was apparent and warranted.

Absolutely worth a try if you like Korean comfort food. We enjoyed everything that was brought to us, and I have now been back several times. Great location, nice folks, reasonable prices and decent sized servings, and you can tell by the number of Korean patrons that they are doing something right!"}
{"text":"Okay so this is my first time having  Korea food......  so I can't tell you how \"authentic\" the food is......  HOWEVER I can tell you that I liked it and will go back. 

 I had the bibimbap and it was VERY good! great spice with that nice little kick of flavor at the end.  The only thing I didn't like about the place is the hours are a bit odd and the place is closed on sundays (just something to keep in mind)."}
{"text":"Magnificent Madison needs a delicious Korean place. One downtown would be fabulous. Sol's has the advantage on location  but severely lacks in the food area on the  things youd adore in a restaurant's spectrum. 

The interior is a tad odd. It's very beige and there's a back section and a slope down to it but there's no notice that it will suddenly slope. That took me for a surprise as I was catching my balance. 

The menu includes 5 or 6 options. My partner and I got bulgolgi; chicken and beef. The rice wasn't fresh, the kimchi wasn't filled with flavor, the pickles were good but not closely similar to other pickles I've had at Korean restaurants. The chicken was odd, dark pieces covered some sauce. It didn't taste that good, kind of ketchupy/barbecue/redish gravy  saucy. Wasn't really barbecue as much as it was chicken with thick covering. I was expecting vegetables in it, there were none. 
Seems like the dishes are easy to toss up, not so much made to order. 

Madison you now have a downtown Korean place. It has lovely servers and underwhelming, bland, low quality food."}
{"text":"The best Korean restaurants in Wisconsin, period. I ordered a pork cutlet and it was tasty."}
{"text":"Sol's on the Square is a great look into traditional Korean cooking, the type Korean families would make for themselves. The food they have is awesome, homemade goodness. After returning back from a recent trip to Korea, and testing this place out on a visit to Madison, this is damn near the exact same as the food I got in Korea. There is a lot of good Americanized Korean places with tons of random sauces and what not, but Sol's gives it to you like it is over there. I started talking to the owner and learned a lot about her and the restaurant, you'll see some of the things I found out below. Feel free to talk to her, she is open, really sweet and has a ton to say. Side note, she said she shipped the spices, bowls, and other cooking essentials straight from Korea and still gets some of the essentials shipped. Pretty authentic if you ask me.

The budaejigae is fantastic and I found out that the owner's family has been making budaejigae for a long time and that her family owns a restaurant in Korea specifically for Budaejigae! They will be selling this stuff like hotcakes when winter rolls in. It just warms the soul! Fantastic!!! Take some of your kimchi and put it in there too! Awesome.

I also shared some of the bulgogi. Sweet and tangy. Fantastic! The marinade was tasty and a good serving of the beef filled me up.

I also saw a bunch of Korean folks eating while I was there. They were there before me and I left before them and from my pathetic Korean I could hear them commenting, \"Masisseoyo, Masisseoyo\" (Delicious!). So sounds like they loved it as well! It will be just like the restaurants in Korea, when they are able to serve Soju and beer. That will definitely amp up the vibe of the place as well as the clientele.

The music is awesome too. A mix of modern Korean Rock, Hip-Hop, Rap and a few other things. Again when the booze starts flowing, it'll be a blast there. I definitely will go back the next time I am in the Madison area. It's a great break from the cheese curds and burgers and an authentic reminder of my time in Korea!

Go to Sol's on the Square if you want great authentic Korean food, cute waitresses' and a very nice owner. Can't wait for the soju to start flowing!"}
{"text":"Excellent. I just moved from Chicago and love me some Korean food. This is one of the few places in Madison that lives up to my expectations."}
{"text":"I dined in with my wife and child one night and ordered take out the next day because I read the reviews and everyone was raving about the KFC(Korean Fried Chicken). When we dined in, we ordered the Korean Hot Pot(Spicy Beef Hot Pot), which is different than Chinese Hot Pot in that its not as flavorful with the variety of meats and veggies. The Hot Pot was good but didnt come with much of anything. Be aware that everything in addition to what what you want costs extra. If you want extra rice its more money, if you want your food in a hot bowl, it costs extra. I think it is a little ridiculous what they charge extra for. Now on to the Korean Fried Chicken. I read the reviews and everyone said it was amazing. I ordered it on Tuesday, because this is the only day you can order it, and brought it home. I was assuming it be a deep fried chicken pieces but it was actually barbeque chicken wings with sesame seeds on it. They werent terrible but nothing like what I expected and they were not amazing like all the reviews I had read about them. So I would not order them again, they were not worth it. I might go back and try the bibimap one of these days but probably not anytime soon"}
{"text":"Los Angeles Korean-American approved is all I'll say! 
Been to all the Korean restaurants here in Madison and Sol's got that authentic kimchi stew that I can only get back at home. The spicy pork and beef bulgogi is good. The spicy cold noodles are good as well. If kimchi is not your thing, stay safe with the hot stone bibimbap, bulgogi and tonkatsu. The side dishes are delicious- the way they should taste. Of course, this is a Korean speaking. So give it a try and see what ya think. Only reason for the four stars... The service. It's usually a wait when busy, since it's a family run business and not lots of servers."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night as I was craving the Korean food my husband and I were accustomed to eating in Los Angeles (Korea Town). I was afraid it might not live up to my standards but I was proven wrong. This place was freaking great! Excellent service, very attentive staff. The food was excellent. We ordered fried dumplings to start then for the entree we ordered beef bulgogi and pork with squid bulgogi. These came with delicious side dishes and bowls of rice. We were absolutely satisfied and will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I never realized this place existed, and very close to the Capitol as well. With the limited option of Korean restaurants in the area, it is natural that I would give it a try!

Pro:
- Good selections of Korean dishes
- Great banchan
- Amazing customer service

Con:
- Flavors are not as rich (but maybe this is what it means to be truly authentic?)


We started with seafood pancakes, which was too doughy. The dipping sauce was also bland and did not complement the pancakes as well as how they serve them in Korean restaurants. It reminded me of a diluted, low sodium soy sauce. 

Their bulgogi is tender, but not enough marinade and \"grill\" flavor.

The buddae jiggae taste great and has a large portion to feed 4-6 people. The broth is not as rich as usual buddae jiggae I tried, but they are generous with their proteins to make everyone full! 

Banchan was few selections, but all are very authentic and fresh. This really elevates the Korean dining experience.

Service is stellar. Everyone in the restaurant strive to provide great service. I would like to extend my thank you for lending us a phone charger. What might seem like a small gesture really shows commitment to customer service.

We ordered bulgogi and it is tender, but not enough marinade/sauce.

Seafood pancakes are too doughy, and the sauce we have was quite bland and did not complement the pancakes as well as how they serve them in Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"All that I have had here was the bibimbap because I've been needing a great go-to Korean place to get my fix since I moved here from Chicago. It was delicious! Definitely recommend paying the $1 extra for the hot stone bowl so your rice gets crispy on the bottom. Also, I really appreciate that soup and appetizers are included. The restaurant is small and I have yet to see them be busy so I have not had any issues with service!"}
{"text":"I love the food!  My husband and I first tried Korean food in Ann Arbor, MI and became huge fans.  We were thrilled to have a Korean restaurant open a few blocks from my office.  I have had lunch, dinner and take out and enjoyed it all.  Plus, the staff is so sweet and helpful!"}
{"text":"I had the BiBimGukSoo noodle soup, their soup special (slow braise beef) and the Korean BBQ with beef (most of the dish I ordered where beef since the server told me it came locally and is never frozen). I thought the food was just okay. But then it went from okay to bad when I got the bill. The bill was over $35 for food that had very little flavor. The Korean BBQ was probably the only thing that was somewhat restaurant quality, but it wasn't impressive enough for $13. I would be better off cooking at home. Maybe once they are more established, they'll focus on flavor and reasonable price. I may try it again, but only if they are still around next year.

If you want to give them a try, note their hours are funky: 
M-F (lunch) 11am - 2:30pm, (dinner) 5:30pm - 10:00pm
Sat  (lunch) 12:00pm - 3:00pm; (dinner) 5:30pm - 11:00pm
Sun closed"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice. They definitely have unique dishes and drinks as well. The first time I went I got the bipbimbap with chicken. This was my first time trying this dish. It was good but I did not as for it spicy so kind of bland for my taste. That being said those it did have good flavor I just prefer it a little spicier for. 

The next time I came here I got the chicken curry dish. This was so good, it was sweet, savory and had just a little bit of kick to add to it. 

Overall Sol's is a great find and is great if you are looking for something a little different or adventurous."}
{"text":"The menu was small and the soups were very expensive, even for two people. The food was good, service was attentive, and portions were perfect.  I do wish they offered a slightly agree menu and had the hot pot soups available for one person."}
{"text":"Great flavors, attentive staff, intimate space... The makings for a 5-star experience. 

Come on. Tuesday night if you enjoy fried chicken or chicken wings--it's their \"KFC Night\" and they serve hot wings fried and dressed in a spicy and tangy marinade that is distinctly different than any wing you could get at any of those chains. 

You may not be able to cook the meet table-side as is the traditional way, but Sol's delivers on great sweet/tangy/salty flavors for their beef Bulgogi with a side of lettuce cups to make your own \"taco\" for lack of a better description. 

The dukbokki hot pot is chuck full of bite-sized dumplings, rice cakes, ramen and tofu in a spicy and earthy kimchi broth that surely has the ability to cure any upper respiratory ailment or cold you may have. It cooks on a burner at your table so you smell the broth coming to a boil as you enjoy the complimentary \"bonchon\" side dishes. 

There are numerous beers on draft, an array of soju (Korean \"sake\") options and several twists on classic cocktails like a Korean version of a brandy old fashioned.

They may be a little under-staffed at peak dining hours but the waiters work really hard to stay on top of drink orders and checking on tables frequently."}
{"text":"Having recently moved from Verona to Down Town Madison (2 weeks from today's post/share) the number of restaurants or bars one may never have tried will become very common for your week/weekend activities. Thus choosing Sol's rather than going to our \"normal/frequent\" spots.

At 7:15pm the small clean place was packed! A quick glance around we felt like we were from out of town. 
While waiting to be seated, there was a young couple eating. It looked like they just received their food . But then they got up and left. I was both shocked and slightly worried to see that much food go to waste!  sad!
Anyway, our waiter was very friendly!! Sake (wine) was very clean and tasty. 
Ordered the spicy pork with 4 sides. And seafood/potato pancake. 
Very impressive! Great taste and plenty full. Took leftovers home and can't wait to polish down later. 
We will frequent as it's now a 10 minute walk."}
{"text":"I love this place. The menu is simple and the food is fresh and yummy! Be careful thou if you do not like spicy food."}
{"text":"My only favorite is their appetizer plate and beef bulgogi. Others were not that impressed. Would like to try the hot pot in the future though. 
But since there isn't too many choices of Korean restaurant in Madison, Sol's is probably the best you can get in downtown."}
{"text":"I can't say enough how delicious this meal was. Huge, incredibly tasty portions with plentiful sides. And cheap too! Also the wait staff was extremely friendly and never made us feel rushed, even though we came in only 30min before closing. I will definitely be returning.

Loses one star because veggie dumplings had meat in them, which wasn't clear from the menu description."}
{"text":"I kind of really miss Korean food that I used to get when I lived in the Northeast. I wasn't super impressed with Sol's. We came in here after seeing a play at the Bartell Theater. The staff were incredibly nice. They brought out the standard banchan at the beginning of our meal.

I ordered the Dolsot Bibimbap in the stone bowl. Unfortunately, the rice didn't sizzle for very long so I didn't get to eat the fried rice that I like to eat. The beef in it was pretty good though. I also got an Iced Green Tea Latte. It was sweet. I don't really know how I feel about it. I didn't finish it because I wasn't that excited about it.

My boyfriend ordered the Soondoobu. It also wasn't super hot. It boiled a bit, but not for long."}
{"text":"Review by a non-Korean for non-Koreans.

I came here wanting to like this place, after having read the review in the Isthmus. I've been eating Korean food for 15 or so years and have sampled restaurants in many major cities. 

Like almost every Korean restaurant everywhere, the decor was rather cheap and not creative or particularly stylish.

The food was not bad. However, to my taste it was not better than New Seoul, the other Korean restaurant in town, and the side dishes were fewer and the portions were less generous. This is disappointing, since marketing for the restaurant, including the Facebook page, suggests that there is no real Korean food in Madison until Sol's.

I'd like to see a big effort to differentiate this place before I consider returning. That doesn't have to include better decor, which certainly would help. But it has to be clearly better and more interesting than other places, and from the perspective of non-Koreans. 

P.S. I also thought Coreana, which closed several years ago, was almost such a place."}
{"text":"Last Thursday was the most anticipated day for me, after being \"rejected\" on Wednesday. While the news on Isthmus only stated that this restaurant opens everyday from 11am-11PM, I didn't expect that that they would be on break during 3.30 till 5.30 PM (my Korean friend did tell me about this, as that is how Korean restaurant usually operates in Korea). My other Korean friends have been posting on facebook about the opening of this new restaurant since a couple of weeks ago. For me, it is always a good sign if the native of the food is excited about the restaurant of which they can be the standard of judgement. 

That night we were so lucky that we got the last seat. It was around 7 PM and the restaurant was full. I guess it was partly due to the number of few seats the restaurant has and also due to the excitement of Madisionian for the new place. Some people after us left as there was not any spot available.

About the service, it was pretty quick (as I was told earlier by a friend who came the day before during dinner time that it took her and her boyfriend about 30 minutes to finally devour their toppoki and the cold noodle, but she said it was worth waiting). The waiter was nice and was responsive when I asked her about the menu. My Korean friend of course was speaking about the menu and the order in their native language, which I really love and I enjoyed their conversation so much. So, my bias about the service is already detected.   

About the food, we ordered Toppoki, beef Bulgogi and the American-Korean fusion noodle (too bad it's with spam, so I didn't get to taste it, but my Korean friend said it tastes like it's served in Korea and they served it in the pot-  Korean doesn't serve the noodle in the bowl, but it should be in the pot - I learned it from the dramas and my Korean friend confirmed it.). As for the Toppoki, it came in a smaller portion (I'm comparing with the portion served in another Korean restaurant in town) however, it is much tastier and the appearance is more similar with the one that I usually see on Korean dramas I watched (It comes with egg too and that's how it is usually served in Korea). I love their toppoki as it serves my taste bud just right. It may be way too spicy for those who do not like spicy food. 

The bulgogi which has a variety of meat from beef, chicken, pork and seafood (plus 2 bucks for seafood) is okay. Yeah, too bad I can't give a very good review for this. I may have been too excited for the toppoki, so the taste of the bulgogi doesn't really leave some strong taste. By the way, bulgogi in Korea is always beef, so if you want to taste the \"real\" bulgogi, just order the beef one, not other meat. 

The side dishes they provided were cucumber pickles (I'm not a big fan of pickles, but this one is super fresh and good, ask the waitress to give you one, if they don't give you any), the lettuce and green onion which is a great side dish and kimchi which is another average.

My overall experience eating here is good and I'll be back. 
I asked my Korean friend about the food and she said: \"The menu is very limited but the ones that we ordered, I can say, are authentic\". There you go: a Korean compliments the food at a Korean restaurant.  

They need to work on more on the service in general but cut them some slack, as they just opened a week ago."}
{"text":"Highlights/lowlights 

1) great Korean food
2) excellent location just off the square
3) friendly service

I came to Sol's on a Friday night with a group of friends around 8pm without a reservation and we were seated right away. The atmosphere is fine, sadly a little more bland than I expected. 

The service is really friendly and we received waters right away. I ordered the pear drink that has soju in it and it was awesome! The flavor wasn't too sweet and you could really taste the pear. Most of us ordered the chicken or beef bulgogi and one of my friends got the bibimbop. We all really liked our food! The chicken bulgogi was good but pretty spicy! If you come be prepared to eat Korean food, this is not an Asian fusion restaurant.

Great place to try if you are looking for Korean food in the downtown area!"}
{"text":"Went last night with another couple for dinner.  
Love the little plate of nummies they bring out for free.  The Kimchee was really good & spicy!  The cuke is excellent.
For our entrees, hubby got the Pork Bulgogi.  Really good.  Beth got the Bibimbap, vegetarian.  Also quite good.  Todd & I split the Budae Jjigae hot pot.  WOW, was this nummy!  Lots of spam (deliciously flavored from the chili broth), sausage, rice stick, kimchee & beef.  Ramen noodles, and sweet potato noodles.  Never had the sweet potato ones before, really liked them! This is apparently a very traditional dish, and the ingredients are listed on the menu, so I don't know why you would complain about there being Spam in it.  You knew it had Spam when you ordered it! (Duh.)
Anyway, we thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience, and will definitely return!"}
