{"text":"I've read the other reviews and they've clearly taken note because that was, hands down, the juiciest burger I've ever had. The bacon was the perfect kind of crispy for a burger. It broke off with every bite and didn't pull the rest out of the burger. Jalape√±os with a crisp bite and the right amount of heat. The nachos were amazing. They make the chips on site, so they're crispy yet substantial enough to carry the hefty amount of toppings. As for beer, I decided on a nitro on draft and a kolsch. The selection of local beers was impressive. Jason, Jess and the rest of the crew made sure we had a great experience. I wouldn't hesitate to bring friends and family and I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Really frustrating. Came in there on the night of the NLCS baseball game, was almost no one in there, and they refused to turn *any* of their many TVs to baseball because Badgers football was on. I thought the *point* of a sports bar with multiple TVs was to show more than one event. And this is playoff baseball!"}
{"text":"Not sure why 608 would receive any bad reviews. Great choice of local beers and the food was awesome! Wait staff was very attentive and friendly. Atmosphere is bright and dining area is clean. I was pleased to leave on a Friday night not smelling like the typical WI Fish Fry. If you were one of the reviewers who left a bad review I would suggest you try giving 608 another shot. I will definitely be a return customer. Very highly satisfied!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent!  Their Friday fish fry is up there with the best I've ever had. Their house salad is huge and amazing with fresh mixed greens and grilled chicken and their homemade balsamic vinaigrette. I've tried many of their memo items and loved them all!  I would give them 5 stars except as a woman who enjoys talking to my sports fanatic husband, the TV's are a bit too loud for me. I get that it's a sports bar though so I guess I should not complain."}
{"text":"Well, I needed to wait 24 hours for this review. Really wanted to love this place. Waited a few months for their opening pains to pass before going. Last night was our first visit. 
Food was good. She had the classic burger and I had the 608 burger. Both were great, and food came out fast.  No issues like others. Only thing is the burgers are too big for the buns.  Larger buns please. Drinks were ok. She got a super generous pour of wine and my beer was ok, but not my first or second choice; as nearly half of the taps were out. So a pretty weak selection on a Saturday night. Prices were super reasonable.  Service, ah service. The place isn't very big for a sports bar, and was crowded, not packed but probably 75% tables filled. Looked like only one wait staff and one bartender on Saturday night with Badger football on tv.  So, tables near us were waiting and waiting. We got her attention and placed beverages and food together not knowing if she would return.  Drinks and food did come quickly but took a bit for us to get served. And those near us still waited. Another server did appear later and the two were able to handle it  well it seemed after the rush. Staff was working hard but understaffed for whatever reason.  I probably would have given a lessor rating last night so glad I waited. We'll try it again most likely in summer and on their patio."}
{"text":"My bacon and feta burger was not stuffed, as the menu indicated it would be. Placed on top of the burger was an overwhelming amount of feta and very thin, flimsy bacon. The hamburger was very overdone (didn't ask how I wanted it cooked), rubbery, and bland. Based on the menu description, I was sure my $12 would be well spent. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Somewhat good beer selection, good service, unique and tasty cheese curds and decent fries. However, the burgers had a spongy and almost meatloaf-like texture in addition to being overcooked. We weren't asked how we wanted them cooked and apparently the default is well done. Not sure if it was just the cooking or the component meats in the ground beef but the taste was not good and the texture was very strange."}
{"text":"I live nearby, so I was so eager for something good to move in. But 608 is just blah -- dreary and divey atmosphere; no charm, just loud TVs. Drink selection is fine, but for vegetarians like me there's only deep fried appetizers. The only nice thing is the outdoor deck with pretty lights."}
{"text":"Great service, nice atmosphere, good tap selection, big tvs. The food was so-so. As a vegetarian, there was almost nothing to eat, not even a veggie burger. My husband didn't enjoy his corned beef sandwich either. It's nice to have a sports bar so close, but we'll stick to drinks."}
{"text":"As a north-sider I was happy to hear that 608 was opening up as the area is lacking in the bar/food scene, I was even happier that it was an established restaurant that had already found success downtown. Unfortunately the experience wasn't as positive as I had hoped. 608 offers many tap beer selections but without a knowledgeable waitstaff as to what those selections are. We first sat in the bar where there was no sign or list with beer names, I then asked the bartender what she had and she handed over a handwritten list of the beers. Seeing as it is essentially summer I was bummed to not find a single IPA (other than a tangerine one), most of the beers on tap didn't seem to fit the season. We then traveled outside because it was so nice out but there wasn't a single umbrella and the sun was beating down on us so bad that we ended up coming back in. Then the menu disappointed as well.. everything had meat in it. Everything. As a vegetarian I am somewhat used to this but most places offer SOMETHING without meat or all cheese. We basically couldn't eat there so we went somewhere else with outdoor seating and a more animal-friendly menu. The space itself seemed clean and nice but all they had blasting on every TV was infomercials for golf items. I will likely be back as I love having a nicer bar near home but a better first impression could have been made."}
{"text":"I love this place! Incredible service! Food amazing! You have to try the cheese curds!!!!! I was able to watch several Olympic events, and several football games all at the same time!!!"}
