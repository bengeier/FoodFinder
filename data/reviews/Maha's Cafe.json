{"text":"Such wonderful people and it shows in their food!

Anything is delicious, but their lamb shish kabob is highly memorable..."}
{"text":"Great food...period.  I've been there countless times and even had them cater my 40th birthday party.  If you like Middle Eastern food, you owe it to yourself to go here."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Maha's. After spending lots of time at the hospital, I need a serious break from the same ol' same ol' every day. 
This place has great service with friendly (and funny!) servers, and their food is hot and fresh! 
I have nothing bad to say about this place. Great pricing, large portions, and on overall very welcoming little restaurant."}
{"text":"Maha's is great.  They have the best falafel in the Cleveland are.  We live in NYC now and have only found one place here (Mamoun's) that approaches the quality of Maha's.  Oh, and they've been pimping Sriracha since at least 2001, well before it became everyone's favorite hot sauce."}
{"text":"GREAT Food.  And I swear it tastes even better when you eat it while walking around the market.  Falafel wrap with hummus extra spicy is the way to go!  And what a steal for $5."}
{"text":"Okay, I rescind my extra star.  Went again with my wife and got the falafel and fatoosh again.

The falafels are still too big and soggy.  The fatoosh ... it's just not fatoosh, it's oily salad.  I don't think they use olive oil for their dressing and where's the sumac?

It's close to work, so maybe I'll go once more for their lamb entree."}
{"text":"Some of the best falafel I have ever had. Definitely the best falafel in Cleveland. I got their falafel with hummus and tabbouleh, and my friend got the falafel with french fries. Can you imagine anything more heavenly than falafel and french fries?!. It was delicious! I loved the way the tahini sauce mixed with the sriracha. My problem with most falafel is that it's dry, but not this one. There was enough sauce, and the falafel was fried perfectly. Grab a ton of extra napkins though, as the sauce will start to drip all down your arm. I may or may not have licked a bit off in public. No shame.  Seriously debated licking it off the table I was at, but didn't want to get splinters in my tongue."}
{"text":"I should have tried the falafel- but I got a grilled chicken salad instead.  

The chicken was grilled perfectly sitting a bed of fresh greens with plenty of tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions.  Their dressing amazingly delicious.  The fried pita chips COMPLETES the salad with nice hints of ridiculous fried goodness.  I was a little disappointed though that they poured the dressing all over the salad instead of offering it on the side.  By the time I got home- the salad was completely soggy :(.  

I will go back soon to enjoy their delicious falafel and other fare soon. :)"}
{"text":"As a novice level consumer of Middle Eastern cuisine, falafel all tastes the same to me. There must be certain qualities of falafel that others consider bad or good, but ordering falafel has always resulted in a predictable experience of a tasty if rather ugly brown patty. 

At Maha's a slightly toasted wrap blanketed the warm crispy falafel inside. The taste, decidedly falafel, compared similarily to the collective falafel experience. The Falafelization of Society!"}
{"text":"Nope--it wasn't a fluke. It wasn't beginner's luck. 

I came back just days (honestly, I couldn't help myself) after my first Maha's experience and ordered the falafel and hummus (or falafil, as they spell it) for my to-go lunch. It was just as glorious as the first time, but this time it was jumbo-sized. Yea, yea, I didn't need the extra portion, but when you're starving you think you can eat the world. 

I also decided to order a side of hummus to taste it on its own--wow. A very similar texture and creaminess to my favorite hummus at Nate's. Just a great alternative when Nate's is closed after 5PM. Try it, you'll see. 

This has clearly become a regular lunch spot for me... whoops!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but anyone who doesn't like the felafel at Maha's doesn't know good felafel.  It's hands down the best felafel I've ever eaten.  Perfect flavor, perfect consistency, crunchy outside.... AMAZING felafel.  Some places grind their ingredients too finely.  Maha doesn't.  It's what makes it SO good.

The baba is excellent.  Smoky and flavorful.  The grape-leaves are some of my favorites.  Great flavor and perfect consistency.

Sam, Maha and the gang are always friendly.  The place is clean and service is great.  

It's one of my favorite lunchtime eateries.  

For a change try the felafel quesadilla!

{"text":"The falafel is perfect.  Fast and friendly service.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"Sadly went by here today to learn they closed the cafe on 10/20/14. At least you can still grab a falafel hummus wrap at the market, but will sadly miss this location! Best wishes to the family!"}
{"text":"For some reason, eating these falafel sandwiches in an actual restaurant do not do them justice.
At the stand at the West Side Market, the falafel sandwiches are UNBEATABLE. They are the best around.

I have taken many, many out of towners to the stand at the market and they all agree that Maha's is the best falafel they have ever tasted. 

I love this place. I wish the cafe was actually somewhere closer than by metro, because quite honestly, that is not the best neighborhood in Cleveland, and we do not often go there.

Maha's is the greatest. Go there. Now."}
{"text":"Maha's does not mess around. This was my first experience at Maha's Cafe and really have only tried falafel a few times in my life. I came in with my Yelp boss Cara and she gave me the warning: best falafel joint in Cleveland. She was spot on. The food here is honestly great, as well as the staff. They pointed me towards to the falafel quesadillas which I had never tried. They were so delicious and topping them with sriracha sauce brought them to a whole new level. Perfect blend of falafel and quesadilla ingredients, and a portion that'll leave your wallet and stomach satisfied! Will definitely be back, hopefully sooner than later."}
{"text":"You won't find a better falafel in Cleveland. I've tried. It's not possible."}
{"text":"The  arrival of Maha's  across the street from my workplace of Metrohealth Medical Center has changed my life. Entrees are consistently wonderful and freshly prepared. Owners and staff are delightful.  My favorite entrees are the veggie stuffed grapeleaves, felafel, hummus, baba ganoush, chicken wrap, and chicken shish kebab platter.  All salads are made with colorful, fresh and crisp ingredients, and accompanied by these totally addictive pita chips. Location is a bit out of tthe way if you are not going to Metro, but well worth making a special trip just to eat here.  Very close to steelyard, and much better and more healthy food than any of the options there."}
{"text":"Felafully, someone gets it. Maha's Cafe is your go-to falafel place in Cleveland. It is your Mediterranean oasis people. I did a bit of preparation in finding the place and it's not that hard to miss. In my initial search I found Maha's Falafel, which is located in West Side Market, more of a quick lunch spot  for when you're getting your veggies and meats on.

So be sure to check the address. Maha's Cafe is located near the MetroHealth Medical center on 25th. This means two things, you'll have to find some parking (easy) and you will most definitely see a lunch-rush. Luckily for me, I had no trouble with either by arriving a little later after lunch. So lucky that there was nobody else in the place! This could've been very discomforting, or a boon from the food gods.

Definitely a boon. A laid-back gentlemen asked me what I wanted, I requested the combination platter. He said, \"Have a seat, relax.\" And so I did. I relaxed, enjoyed the decor and the view of this place. A stark difference from the West Side Market shop, this place has class and looks like it houses the World's Best Felafil. A few moments passed and I see the guy bringing me this huge plate. Go ahead, stray away from the review for a moment and see that photo.

Right? YEAAAAH. That's a lot of food. I find myself saying salaam to about six grape leaves, all very warm and tender in their greetings to me. On either side, pools of hummus, graciously drizzled with some spices and tahini sauce. Up top, about six falafel patties just being cozy on a bed of lettuce, just minding their business being the ideal falafel texture, shape, and taste. In the middle, the pièce de résistance, the tabbouleh! Tabbouleh that takes away my abilities to describe how good it was.

It is easier to talk about the short-comings of any kind of Mediterranean food. Because we all have a certain attribute we give to the dish we deem supreme. The falafel has to be just crunchy enough, but not too hard, gives easily but does not skimp on flavor. Tabbouleh that isn't soggy and too tart, one that gives proper praise to parsley. I could find no short-comings with Maha's combination platter, other than it was a great deal of food for one sitting. But I guess that's my punishment for ordering it for one sitting. 

This is a shining point, and probably what makes me a fan of Maha's Cafe. The price point for the quality of food is superb. You can bet on getting a wrap or roll, or whatever on the menu, and feel like you've ate a good meal. The accolades and proclamations of being the best are well deserved and rightfully touted. I'm convinced that their spelling of falafel as \"falafil\" is their way of saying that when you're there, you are going to get your fala-fill."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite falafel place. 

Their falafel is delicious. I'd been going to the one in the market since I was a little kid. When I went to try the  new one at metro, the owner knew my name and what I wanted to order! Now that's service...

Since then I've tried the burgers (good!), onion rings (great!) and gyro (also really good!). Definitely worth the trip. Yum."}
{"text":"Not since chasing down a famed falafel food truck in New York City have I had such a tasty falafel/hummus wrap!!! Seriously, folks! We all know that falafel can sometimes come across dry or pasty. However, Maha's falafels are well-seasoned little balls of yumminess. The outside is perfectly fried to give the whole nugget some toothsome crunch while the inside is soft and moist. Do yourself a favor and give Maha's a try. Once you do, I guarantee you'll be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Very clean, good lighting, it's own parking and VERY yummy food. Have been a few times and tried various salads and falafel dishes. Always been pleased. They also do takeout which comes in handy."}
{"text":"I am stuck in Independence, OH Monday through Friday because of work. I eat at Aladdin's out of necessity and it is one of the only places that is not a complete corporate joint. I was driving to the West Side Market the other day and decided to get off by Metro Health and stop at Maha's Cafe instead. It was just as good as the stand at the market and is a perfectly spiced falafel. I prefer Cafe Falafel over by Fairview Hospital for meat platters. Falafel Cafe by Case Western is just not good."}
{"text":"We had lunch here one Saturday several years ago. I was bowled over by the supreme excellence of the falafel sandwich. Best falafel in town, I tell ya. Only thing is, we stopped by for a return visit one Saturday maybe two years ago and the sign said they're closed Saturdays. Yelp now says they're open Saturdays. I sure hope so. Can anyone confirm this?"}
