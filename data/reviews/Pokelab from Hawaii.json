{"text":"I really love sushi and poke, and was really excited about this place opening up right next to my apartment. The first time I went, It was during their soft opening. I don't remember exactly what I paid, but it was a lot. They were out of most types of fish, so I got tuna instead of my usual salmon.The tuna had a strange texture, did not seem fresh.  The toppings were free additions that day (this has changed, they are now .25 each), but the avocado was extra. when i asked for cucumber, they gave my ONE piece ( this has since changed). Overall, I felt like they were being really cheap in front of me and it was very uncomfortable. portions of fish and especially toppings were very small. When I went home, however, i ate the bowl and was very full and satisfied.   Today, I went for the second time. I had a $2 off coupon from JSM i was excited to use, and that was my main motivation for going. I got there, got salmon this time (which was very good and very fresh!!!), as well as toppings. The cucumbers were given in a good amount this time. The avocado was covered with lime juice or citric acid to keep it from browning, but the acidic taste was way too strong and overpowered the avocado. I wish they had tempura crunch, but they have fried onions and garlic which are really good as a topping. Overall, it was a lot better than the soft opening, but i really don't like how cheap they are. 1) portions or fish and topping were small once again (although they give you a really good amount of rice! so you will still be VERY full after you eat the whole thing).   When I presented my coupon, the cashier said they stopped accepting them on 2/18. There was no expiration date on the coupon itself, and there was no sign on the door. The only sign about this was taped to the register which you encounter AFTER THEY MAKE YOUR FOOD. i was very very very disappointed by this. Its just an overall uncomrtable experience watching them be so stingy with the food and coupons.   They do have a new punch card though...10 bowls 11th is free up to $12. My bowl ended up being $7.12, which is very reasonable. It does taste good, and it is very filling. Overall, I would still recommend this place, but they have vast improvements to make if they want to stick around."}
{"text":"Decent for the price. Staff was friendly. I had salmon and tuna in my bowl. It was good and fresh. They could use a few more sauce selections but other than that, I like it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite poke place in town--its a little further from my office than the others but it's worth the walk. The customization options are huge, and they have so many toppings and mix-ins available. It's easy to make a healthy meal, and you can switch it up a lot--they have more protein options than anywhere else in town."}
{"text":"I kept walking by this place, always seeing it closed, but I finally saw it open, and took this opportunity to try it out.   The counter people seemed a little flustered since there were all of 3 people standing in line.   There seemed to be something wrong with the credit card machine.... but after about 5 minutes, I finally put in my order.   I got a salmon poke bowl with mixed greens.  You are allowed to choose 1 protein on top of either white rice/ brown rice or mixed greens..... with a few toppings of choice....I can't remember what I chose exactly, but it was pretty darn tasty.  Everything was fresh and the fish was actually pretty good for being in Central Illinois.     Hopefully, they stay on top of their game!!  A great addition!"}
{"text":"I went there today and although the bowl came together very nicely with good flavors, the portions of the protein were way too little for the price. Overall, the price wasn't that bad, I ended up paying about 8.50 for two proteins (salmon & crab) and 4 toppings but I still think it was overpriced for the portions of protein compared to a chipotle bowl for example. You do get a substantial amount of rice but I would just prefer more protein. With the extremely small amount of protein, I felt like I had a rice bowl with some mayo sauce because I could barely taste the salmon I had ordered. With a poke bowl, the focus of the bowl should be the fish (as highlighted by their logo) but sadly, a tablespoon worth of fish in a bowl of rice does not cut it. Although, I enjoy the overall bowl's flavors and components and come repeatedly, I wish it was executed more thoughtfully."}
{"text":"Came in at 1:00 for lunch on Wednesday and there were no other customers. I ordered a mix between brown and white rice and previous Yelpers are right when they say this place piles on the rice to make your bowl look fuller because they skimp out on meat and veggies.   I ordered one scoop of crab ($1) and spicy tuna ($2.50) and was very upset to see that the spicy tuna is minced and creamy instead of chunky/diced like other places. When I ate the poke, the spicy tuna just got lost. I wonder if they do the same thing with the regular tuna ($3).   The sauces were pretty good, I got wasabi, Hawaiian sweet, spicy mayo, and ponzu. The topping selection is decent but the scoop of avocado is pathetically tiny. I know other Yelpers have complained about this but they still haven't changed it.   I liked the selection of dry toppings and really appreciated that they were complimentary.   The fact that I had to pay $1 for a bottle of water because they don't have water cups/refill station is really weird. I don't know other restaurants like this.   Lunch cost about $8 and did fill me up, but that's because it was mostly rice. I would probably come back here but would not get spicy tuna and would not rave about this place being the best poke ever because it really isn't."}
{"text":"It was good but a little pricey because the scoops are small. We had to get double and triple of stuff to make the bowl look full. We ate all our food and it was fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I have lived in Hawaii before moving to Illinois, so I know a good deal about how traditional poke is supposed to look and taste like. And coming to this area near Green Street and seeing that a place called Poke Lab opened, I was extremely excited to try it out.   When I first walked in I noticed an employee cutting what looked like frozen blocks of tuna packaged in plastic. There was nothing else on the menu that looked of that color and size, so my educated guess is that they use frozen fish. This normally wouldn't be a problem for me, as I know a lot of restaurants have struggles with food costs, and raw fish that is safe to consume raw is especially expensive to obtain and maintain freshness for. However, my concern is that the menu clearly states that the fish is fresh - \"Fresh Tuna\", \"Fresh Salmon\", and \"Fresh Crab Meat\", etc. (one look and anyone can tell that the crab meat is imitation flakes) Putting a veil over customers' eyes is frankly disrespectful and cheap.  When you first walk into Poke Lab, an employee greets you and asks what kind of base you want. The standard base costs $3 and you have the option of white or brown rice, a standard spring mix salad, or a mix of whatever you'd like. Next, they ask what sort of protein you would like. From what I can remember, they have salmon, tuna, shrimp, crab meat, crab salad, and spicy tuna, with tofu as an option for vegetarians or those who do not like fish. On first sight the crab and shrimp do not look appetizing (and those meats aren't commonly seen in traditional poke anyway) so I opted for a scoop of salmon. Afterwards they ask if you want any sauces - I tried the Hawaiian Sweet and it tasted like a pretty standard teriyaki sauce with a small fruity kick. Their spicy mayo also tasted pretty good. Next, you have a variety of mix-in toppings to add and mix with your fish before they add it to your bowl. These cost $0.25 cents each and were not bad, but the diced onion looked fairly browned and not too appetizing. Some other noticeable toppings include corn, edamame, cucumber, pickled radish, avocado (also $0.25, which is an excellent deal considering the fact that avocado almost always costs extra in any other establishment), seaweed salad, and masago.   Overall, however, I was disappointed by the bowl. I understand that maybe the bowl is not the same kind of stuff I enjoyed back in Hawaii, but it tasted absolutely nothing of the childhood memories I thoroughly loved. The sauce was of fairly generic taste and was overly sweet, and fish did not taste or look fresh as it was slightly discolored and felt limp - it almost disintegrated, for lack of a better word, when I pressed down my fork down on it, a clear sign that the fish actually came in frozen, or was shipped fresh and then frozen/defrosted.   To be honest, the bowl was not terrible. The avocado tasted fresh (if it was not fresh you would notice browning) and the sauce was not bad. After all, no one walks into a Chipotle to eat authentic, traditional Mexican cuisine. But I do find it disrespectful to advertise fresh seafood, and have customers pay higher prices for frozen fish that you cut right in front of the consumer. Because some customers will know what something is supposed to look/taste like.  If you want better poke in the area I recommend Kung Fu Tea just a block away; though their poke is a bit overpriced, it is still of better quality than Pokelab. The staff at Pokelab, however, was extremely friendly and attentive. They were very kind and helped me through the process of ordering."}
{"text":"Soo delicious! Fresh ingredients in a build your own style. I love a good sashimi/poke bowl and there's a great variety of ingredients here.   For a super flavorful concoction, you can't go wrong with: half spring salad mix and half brown rice (nuttier than white), 2 scoops salmon, spicy mayo, pickled radish, seaweed salad, masago, avocado, rice seasoning, crunchy garlic and jalape√±o."}
{"text":"The poke at Pokelab is pretty basic but also tasty. It's a bit pricey considering that it costs about the same or slightly more than what you can get further west, but at least CU finally has a poke place. If you are a regular customer, they have a rewards program where you can get a poke bowl free after buying 10.  I recommend starting with a half rice half salad mix base. Then, get salmon and spicy tuna salad for proteins. Sometimes I add shrimp, too. Then, I get Sriracha, soy sauce, and spicy mayo. For toppings, I get two scoops of edamame, cucumber, carrots, seaweed salad, and sometimes masago (fish eggs). Finally, I get pretty much all of the dry toppings."}
{"text":"I cannot even describe their untasty food in any other word I would use to describe one stars restaurant! genuinely, i would rate ZERO Star if such option exist. Try to avoid this restaurant if you are champaign but not knowing what you want to eat, a waste of money! Fish isn't fresh, sauce tastes unstable!"}
{"text":"Go to Sakanaya for your poke, not here.  They were very stingy with their ingredients. Each scoop of salmon, tuna, etc. costs $2.5. I only got one scoop, and there was only 4-5 small pieces. The salmon also tasted fishy, which is not what you want from raw fish... You also don't get your money's worth for the avocado. She brought out this very tiny scooper to dispense it, and I ended up with 7 tiny chopped pieces of avocado. The only thing they were very liberal with was the rice, which is just to compensate for their stinginess with everything else. So I basically ended up paying for an expensive bowl of rice. The flavorings were good though at least!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Pokelab and I would definitely recommend it. My bowl was phenomenal and relatively inexpensive considering the quality of the vegetables and meat. Additionally, the facility was very well kept and the service was awesome."}
{"text":"I've been once so far and it was really good! Love the way they do the pricing, it makes a cheaper options than other places that charge you one price and tell you up to many you can pick. I can't have all the ingredients so it was nice to just pay for what I'd eat. There was a good portion of rice and a decent portion of salmon. I had to do no sauce due to allergies but my lunchmate had sauce and said it was really good. I'll definitely be going back. Only negative I would say is that it's difficult to hear/be heard because I'm short and the glass is high but it's good the food is being protected. I wish EVERYTHING was fresh but again, it still tasted really good and the pricing is great."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a poke place forever to come to Champaign! This place did It right! I love the modern vibe and the selection. Price works for me and now I'm a regular. It's my new new choice for healthy food!"}
{"text":"My go-to order: fresh salmon, fresh tuna, brown rice, mixed greens, mango, avocado, edamame, rice seasoning and Korean pepper flakes. Ask for the spicy signature mayo as your sauce!  It feels like a ton of places on Green St. suddenly started selling (or at least advertising that they sell) poke bowls. I think PokeLab is my favorite spot in Champaign for poke, and I really do hope it sticks around!   The bowls are very reasonably priced and filling. They definitely don't skimp out on rice and the added veggies. But I would highly recommend that everyone get TWO orders of fish in their bowl (my favorite combo is getting both fresh salmon and fresh tuna). It's still quite affordable!"}
{"text":"Everything looks fresh and clean!! There are a lot of options too. It's located closed to green street and sixth."}
{"text":"I really don't think management knows how to own a Poke place. The lady who was managing the team seemed rude to her coworkers when I went.   Also, the portion of meat is so sad! I've had the poke bowl and sushi burrito from Kung Fu Tea and they give a generous amount of fish! It's so good there. However, when I tried out Poke Lab I was unimpressed. It's so confusing even just going down the line. Management needs to get it together because right now, it's not that great. Good customer service, bad planning.  As for the bowl itself, the taste is very americanized in my opinion. The sauces are not that great. Also, some topping options are weird and unfitting in my opinion. I want to like this place, but I think it could be better.   Also, there's no fountain water, just bottled water. So if you're eco friendly ... then remember to bring your own water!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from California and I get Poke at least once a week and this place makes me never want to return. No one was in front of me in the line and it took me 20 minutes to make a basic order.  I was not greeted upon entering the establishment for at least 5 minutes.  They noticed I was there and looked at me and continued whatever they were doing, not even a \"hello\" or \"be with you in a minute\".  The person that was taking my order was so painfully slow, I began breathing slow just watching her!  There was another customer that came in 10 minutes after I did and another employee helped her and she ended up paying for her food first before me! That's how painstakingly slow it was. I didn't catch the employee's name that was helping me because she didn't have a name tag.   My rating:  Food: average, selection was basic. Needs more veggie toppings (ie cilantro, etc). They should also include a fountain dispenser instead of just bottled beverages. Service: poor  P.s. I also filled out a comment card saying the same thing."}
{"text":"Pokelab was okay. I am not Hawaiian but I enjoyed my fair share of poke while visiting the islands. I got white rice, fresh salmon and spicy tuna on mine and assorted toppings. The rice wasn't fresh; the spicy tuna was not spicy. I asked for spicy mayo and it wasn't spicy; not even mildly. The service was quick, but it's hard to hear when the music speaker is close to the ordering area. Glad I tried it but I won't be coming back."}
