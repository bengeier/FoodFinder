{"text":"This place is so good that I forgot to take a picture my hand pulled noodle soup 
you can choose any size noodles you want.

Parking is horrible"}
{"text":"Their signature Lanzhou Hand Pulled Noodle in broth was wayyy to salty. I could feel my tongue getting grimy just from the texture of it. 

Also, whats with the cheap attitude with the beef? I think they gave me three ultra slim slices to go with my noodle soup. So 2 secs into my meal, all I was having was salty broth and noodles.  

I'm not coming to this place to go on a diet. SERIOUSLY!!"}
{"text":"Bad service,  bad food. Hot noodle soup with no ac.  a bowl of noodle soup with only few meat and 2 thin slices of veg."}
{"text":"nothing wrong with customer, it was about the food. I research about this restaurant before I make decision I go but still disappointed. Something wrong with the noodle, the portion between meat and noodle were balance. I ordered the pork rib noodle large size and there are 5 pieces of rib only. Yes 5 pieces! I have to eat the second half bowl with soup."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try this place out but boy were we disappointed. This place is supposed to serve hand pulled and sliced noodles. We ordered the braised beef with planed noodle soup.  The soup base was bland and we had to season ourselves with salt, chili oil and lots of vinegar. The braised beef were tough and hard to chew and the so called hand cut noodles, we don't believe them to be made fresh and cut just before cooking cause in both our bowls, there were large chunks of noodles stuck together which made us wonder if they were precut and frozen. Even the bok choy in the noodles tasted like they were boiled in plain water. We definitely won't be coming back for a second meal."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place a 2 but I was really hoping for delicious noodle soup and what I got was bland and  underwhelming. 

The customer service was quick and courteous despite the language barrier.  When I had to send back the black egg? that I didn't know would come served on top - I'm allergic to egg they came back with some more shredded chicken which was really nice. I didn't ask they just brought it. 

They did however serve me the wrong noodles - I asked for round - like an udon noodle & I got wide flat noodles which were under cooked. 

I'm on the search for a delicious soup with yummy udon noodles. I'll keep searching."}
{"text":"I had a craving for noodles so we stumbled upon this place. I found the restaurant to be small and a bit run down looking. Workers are Mandarin so we had to communicate with half broken Cantonese and English. 

Started off with a onion flavoured pancake for $2.99

You can choose the noodle of your liking. The name of the restaurant is \"Hand Pulled Noodle\" and I did not hear no one smashing dough on a table like I usually do so I'm questioning whether its truly fresh hand pulled noodles or maybe they just and a batch made already. 

Got a chance to try the beef brisket noodle $7.99 (large), pork rib with noodle $7.99 (large), seafood noodle $12.99 (large). Went with what they call \"slightly thin noodle\" which is the thickest noodles they serve. The noodles had a nice chew to them, the soup was very plain tasting and the meat was a bit on the chewy side and was decent in quantity. 

I would only recommend coming here if you want some quick noodles to munch on. Nothing impressive that stood out.

This place has potential to survive, but I wasn't very impressed with my visit today. I even decided to heed Jennifer K's warning and go at around 3pm when it's much quieter, which it was.

One thing I would come back here for is their complimentary tea. It actually tastes very good! It made me have second thoughts of getting a cold drink at another place after since this place doesn't serve drinks.

I had the traditional hand pulled noodle, slightly slim, while my dad had the braised beef noodle, slim. The noodles weren't bad for both of us, however both of us only had about 3 slices of beef. Like, really? I know it's 10% off and such but they could be a bit more generous with the meat offerings, cause the bowl didn't even make us full.

Why I say this place has potential was that only half their menu is being offered at the moment. Their snacks do look promising, and if I see better reviews from future Yelpers or my friends I might come back."}
{"text":"We discovered this place when we drove by from Kennedy. I would say it is kind of hidden from the plaza parking lot. I would of never walk up to that corner and eat any of the restaurant there.

When we first walked into the restaurant, we thought the food wasn't that good or even tasted bad because there were only few tables with customers. However, we went around 5:30 pm so maybe too early for people to have dinner.

I was kind of surprised the food tasted not too bad, except for the skewers. I don't think I will order them again if I ever go back for some quick noodles. I had some better ones from somewhere but price was 2x more. This restaurant's skewer kidneys weren't cook too well. Part of it had deep red blood on, and some part were cooked too dry. Their noodles weren't too bad but they could do better. They were just a little soft when I eat it.

I would say their food were alright, and I might go there again and try their other noodle soups."}
{"text":"To be fair, Lanzhou Hand Pulled Noodle has been in business for almost 2 years?! It must be doing something right. 

Without all the hyped and excitement when I last visited on their Grand Opening Day, I found it is a solid noodle joint. Lunch time with only a few tables, almost all of the customers were Mandarin speaking, it does have a authentic feel to it. 

I finally got to try their hand-pulled noodle instead of knife shaved version this time. I love the chewiness of their noodle. The soup was light and not oily at all. Spicy Shredded Chicken Noodle was A-OK but the portion was huge. 

Good place for some cheap eat. I will be back!"}
