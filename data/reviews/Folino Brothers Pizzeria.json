{"text":"Name has changed to Nobbie's since last review was posted.  Food has remained the same.  Great local pizza place.  If your into wings, I recommend the dry rub wings (ask for extra dry rub)."}
{"text":"A bit pricey but very good pizza. If you live in the Upper St.Clair/Mt Lebo/Scott/Bridgeville area and you like Fiori's in Dormont, you'll love this place, as Folino's Bros pizza taste pretty similar to theirs."}
{"text":"Good pizza and wings. Quick service and always a friendly staff!"}
