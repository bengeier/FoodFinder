{"text":"Recommended by Baymont Inn staff. So glad we went! About to celebrate their first year, this restaurant has a huge menu with very reasonable (read: cheap) prices for ample quantities of decent food. Pitcher margaritas were on special, too :) The furniture is worth a visit all by itself - each table, chair and booth is hand painted and unique!"}
{"text":"This Mexican restaurant appears to be in a building that was originally an Italian restaurant.  There was a huge Italian-style statue outside, and large chandeliers and \"crystal\" light fixtures...intermingled with the colorful tables and typical Mexican restaurant decor.  But the menu was pure Mexican deliciousness.  We had the chicken enchiladas and steak fajita nachos.  Yum!  Definitely check this place out if you're in Tuscola."}
{"text":"I was  working in the local area temporarily and My hotel recommended to stop in and give them a try. They are a fully authentic Mexican restaurant with super friendly staff and a comfortable atmosphere. The food was very flavorful tasty, served hot and in a timely manner."}
