{"text":"Found this place through an internet search during our weekend in Montreal. The food and service were excellent and the prices very reasonable. Having lived in France, I was pleasantly surprised by how authentic the food was, especially the fondue and confit de canard. Also loved the crème brûlée! Our only complaint was that we didn't realize beforehand that this is an \"apportez votre vin\" establishment, so make sure to bring your own wine if you want a glass with your meal. Otherwise, a great place to dine in a quiet neighborhood away from the tourist areas of Montreal."}

Apportez votre vin, abordable, très bon. Idéal pour une atmosphère chaleureuse.

Nous étions un groupe de 16 personnes et je crois qu'il y avait plusieurs groupes ce soir-là. Le service s'est montré à la hauteur et courtois malgré le défi que la soirée présentait.

Abordable : il offrent deux choix de table d'hôte, la petite table et la grande table. La petite table est moins chère et n'inclut pas l'entrée et le dessert.  Mais une soupe potage est incluse (j'ai aimé).

Notez que c'est un apportez votre vin, mais qu'ils n'acceptent ni bières ni spiritueux.
Ils offrent d'autres plats que la raclette dont des bavettes, des carrées d'agneau et de la fondue (pour deux personnes min.). La portion de fondue était très généreuse! Nous ne l'avons pas terminé! Elle vient avec des tranches de pain, quelques légumes et des charcuteries. Il est possible de choisir le type de fondue, échalottes, champignons etc.

Le dessert, j'ai choisi la mousse au chocolat était très bon. Un peu cher pour un dessert (à la carte environ 10 $), mais on pardonne, étant donné que c'est un apportez votre vin, que j'aurais très bien pu prendre la grande table et que les portions sont grandes. Je n'avais plus faim et c'était clairement de la gourmandise!

Bring your own wine, affordable, very good. Ideal for a cozy atmosphere.

We were a group of 16 people and I think there were several groups that evening. The service has risen to the occasion, was courteous despite the challenge.

Affordable:  two choices of table d'hôte are offered, a small table and large table. The table is cheaper and does not include the first course and the dessert. But a soup is included (I liked).

Note that this is a BYOB, but they do not accept beer or spirits.
They offer other dishes including raclette, bavette, square lamb and fondue (for two min.). The fondue portion was very generous! We could not finish it ! It comes with slices of bread, vegetables and meats. It is possible to choose the type of fondue, shallots, mushrooms.

The dessert I chose, the chocolate mousse was very good. A bit pricey for a dessert (à la carte about $ 10), but it is all forgiven because it is a BYOB and I could have taken the big table, plus the portions are large. I was not hungry and it was cleary indulgence!"}
{"text":"La qualité de la cuisine s'est beaucoup améliorée depuis l'année dernière. Il faudrait continuer d'améliorer les desserts. 
L'atmosphère du resto dans ce repas de Noël était excellente. 
Excellent service attentionné."}
{"text":"This is my husband's and my favourite restaurant in Montreal. It has a warm and cozy ambience and the staff and owner is top notch. Food is rich, wonderful and everything you'd expect a memorable night out in Montreal to be."}
{"text":"Went for the European style raclette dinner, it was amazing, with great service, nicely done decore and atmosphere.  Portion size was just right."}
{"text":"The best meal we had during our trip to Montreal. Didn't try the fondue or the raclette but still really enjoyed what we got. I got the daily special of braised wild boar shoulder & my girlfriend got the lamb chops with caper & thyme sauce. Both were truly exceptional. You can tell they take great care if using quality ingredients and cooking techniques. Service was also outstanding and very attentive. Although, we didn't partake, the Bring-Your-Own-Wine is a really nice option."}
{"text":"Tucked away on a residential street is a most charming and wonderful restaurant! We made a last minute reservation to La Raclette to finally try raclette and after our experience here, were so happy we did. We were warmly greeted by our host, and seated by a window, which we had requested. Our waiter was extremely welcoming and explained how the menu worked. After receiving some delicious French bread and a jar of small cornichon pickles, we ordered the raclette for two, and a kid's fondue meal for our child, who was very excited to have gazpacho with it as well.
The German Beer soup I got as an appetizer was delicious and a heartier version of French Onion soup.
My husband had the scallop app, which was a thinly sliced raw carpaccio, very fresh and mild tasting.
For the main course, we were presented with a burner box and small square tray for melting the cheese. On top of the box were two small square dishes containing quartered boiled potatoes in one dish and sautéed mushrooms, red peppers and asparagus pieces, as well as a large plate of the cheese slices, thinly sliced ham, salami, dried prosciutto and a serving of a lovely green salad with thinly sliced beets on it.
My son received a smaller version of their fondue and it was perfect for him (as well as us to sample). He too received a dish with salad, some ham and veggies to dip and a basket of bread pieces as well.
We had so much fun melting our cheese and figuring out different combinations to eat our melted cheese with, and both meals were outstanding. Since we brought our own wine as well, it was even more enjoyable. The service was also excellent and attentive, with our water cups being refilled quickly (such rich food makes one thirsty, after all!).
Finally for dessert I ordered the Chocolate Dome which was presented with flair and melted for us by our waiter with warm butterscotch. Inside the dome was ice cream, small cubes of pound cake and fresh berries on the perimeter. It was like a chocolate fondue without the pot!
This had to be the best dining experience we have had in Montreal so far and beyond the excellent food, we had such a wonderful experience visiting this outstanding place! If you are deciding whether or not to visit, seriously, go now, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The place to go for a warm cheesy treat to get through the loooong Montreal winter. Service is excellent and the food - it's melted cheese so you can't go wrong :)"}
{"text":"Nice environment, good service and bettee food!
The price is actually a menu set, so we had the Petit menu, which includes a soup as starter and then the main course you choose. We finally went for the raclette and the cheese was tasty and it melted in our mouth... It is served with potatoes, veggies and charcuterie. 
Do not miss the super chocolate cake!!"}
{"text":"My very first experience at a Swiss raclette restaurant was here today and as usual, after checking the reviews on Yelp which were quite positive, I didn't hesitate to give it a try. I can't say I was impressed nor disappointed but it was one of them experiences where you'd feel happy you've had the chance to at least experience a novelty for the sake of discovering something new. We tried the three course raclette and fondue. We were two couples. You'd get stuffed if you can finish them all.
 
Pro: - Very tasty and high quality deer tartare
         - Amazingly tasty and rich raclette cheese
         - Awesome desserts. We tried the chocolate
            dome with hot caramel sauce and poire 
            Hélène. Both are excellent choices
          - Very nice and attentive staff, they'd even
             come outside of the restaurant upon your 
             arrival and help you find a parking spot if    
             you ask them to
          - They sell $6 parking pass so you can park
              your car in the reserved residential spots
              on streets nearby
           - BYOW

Con: - Not much except for the price. For two, 
             It cost us $130 with tax and tip and it's a 
             BYOW. Well, it's Swiss Harry, not a falafel
             joint. Duh! Right. 
          - You'd need to go to the gym the following 
              day to burn them rich damn calories
          - Cholesterol? Haha, you're in the wrong 
              restaurant.  

I'd go back but only on a special occasion and
I'd order the raclette if it's me and my significant other. The cheese in this one is superior to the fondue. Anyhow, my next fondue would be a regular one, not cheese. I can survive for a few weeks after here today without cheese. But damn, it was good tho."}
{"text":"Sweet ambience and delicious cheese fondue - I also love that it's BYOB. 

You choose between a small (around $26) or large (around $36) 'table d'hôte.' or any main dish.  I'm sure the appetizers and desserts must be good but I've never been even a little hungry after the small version, which comes with soup before an coffee/tea after the main dish. Minimum 2 persons/orders for the three fondu options on the menu."}
{"text":"Heaven. Just what I wanted on a chilly night in Montreal.

We had the small meal, which came with a stellar spinach and mushroom soup topped with fried onions, followed by the raclette of course. 

The raclette was delicious, as always, with excellent accompaniments, including 3 kinds of cured meats, potatoes, asparagus, broccoli, peppers, and cauliflower. And the standout unique touch--thin slices of apples that seemed to have been soaked in cider. They were so delicious.

The wait staff was attentive and friendly, and the space was warm and quiet, making for a bit of a romantic setting on a cold night with lightly falling snow. 

It is BYOB so we were able to bring a split of a really delicious wine that reminded us that we really need to pay more attention to wine quality on a daily basis. 

No complaints, I'd go back tonight if I were still there."}
{"text":"This was a very pleasant experience on a Thursday evening.  We had the rachlette for two, just the right amount of food and very nice on a cool summer evening.  Bring your own wine; nice patio and quiet."}
{"text":"I haven't had fondue this delicious since I was in Paris. My best friend and I dipped everything in that amazing pot of cheese until we couldn't go any further.... And there was still good left. Very generous, fresh food. Tucked away in a small neighborhood, it was very quiet and romantic."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite restaurant in Montreal. I have been twice now and both times were exceptional. For a fixed price, you get an appetizer, soup, unlimited bread, entree, dessert, and coffee. The prices are beyond reasonable for the amount of (amazing) food that you you get. Food is as good as or better than anything I've had in Boston/NYC without the rip-off factor.

Both times I had the flank steak, which comes with sauteed green beans and these hashbrown-like crispy potatoes that are to die for. I've also had their mushroom soup and regular dinner salad (which is loaded with figs and some fun cheeses) and both were awesome. The one thing not to miss, however, is the Raclette. Ask for extra peppercorns, you will not be disappointed. I know few things better than a slab of baked, melted cheese on a plate. It's served with a side of gherkin pickles, which sounds strange but the combination is really incredible. I have also had tried their creme brulee and chocolate torte, both fantastic. It's BYOB, which of course always helps keep our wallets happy! And they never judge for bringing a bottle per person :)  

The services is always over the top as well. Their menu is in French only, however, staff are always helpful with the translation. The ambiance is beautiful too; it's a small neighborhood joint that is near downtown but not in the middle of the hustle and bustle of everything. It's quiet and outdoor seating is available in summer (and its really cute!) Definitely check this place out; I will definitely be back next time I am in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Great quiet place with fantastic service and food.  All the recommendations were spot on.  Definitely need to come back again.  Had the raclette as appetizer and perfectly cooked liver. Yum!"}
{"text":"Incredible. Anyone staying in the touristy heart of Montreal should find time to grab an Uber or take the metro down to this place for dinner. Our Uber cost us less than $10 American and the BYOB was an interesting experience you don't really get anywhere in the U.S. The food was INCREDIBLE. We all got the 3 course dinner and the beef was the favorite of the table for sure. No wifi here, but it was okay because it encouraged us to all enjoy each other's company. One of the best dinners I've had in a LONG time."}
{"text":"So good! Had the 3 course meal and it was super filling and delicious! Recommend he Raclette or fondue - and the chocolate dome!!"}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal! Had to take a cab from Montreal Centre  to get there, but also accessible by metro.  They speak great English and are very helpful with the menu (they do have an English menu).  We were there to celebrate a 40th Birthday for dinner.  Food was outstanding!  Great ambience and staff extremely friendly and accommodating.  We ordered the raclette  which was divine.  Best meal we had while visiting Montreal! Being able to bring our own wine also made it very affordable.  Love this place and would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Oh, my.  La Raclette was excellent.  So, my husband and I were staying in an Airbnb in Montreal - our first trip to the city.  We were walking from our Airbnb to the closest métro station and we passed La Raclette.  Since I lived in France at one point, I know and LOVE raclette.  My host mom made it a few times and it was always super fun and amazing.  

Since they didn't open until 5:30 p.m., we decided to eat dinner there on our way back from our afternoon of sightseeing.  I was super impressed with everything La Raclette was doing.  First of all, they are BYOW so you can walk one block, grab a cheap bottle of red or white, and bring it back to the table.  Yum.  

Second, their entire menu is a prix fixe.  You can order two or three courses, which include a soup + entree or soup + appetizer + entree.  Since you're eating at La Raclette, you MUST order raclette as your entree.  Here's the deal: raclette is a type of cheese from Switzerland that is melted and poured on various meats, veggies, and tubers.  The raclette \"maker\" works like this: you have a metal tray that is either inserted or placed onto a hot, metal surface with cheese on top so it melts and gets super gooey.  You then take this gooey, melted cheese and pour it all over the meats, veggies, and tubers.  The raclette entree comes with potatoes, assorted veggies, deli meats, cornichons, and bread.  Pour at will and enjoy.  You will NOT be disappointed.

I absolutely LOVED this place and would go back in a heartbeat if I find myself in Montréal some time in the future.  I totally missed raclette since I had only ever experienced it in France, so I was so excited and France-homesick to have raclette in Montréal.  The food here was delicious, the service was fantastic, and you can BYOW so your bill is only like $50CAD for two people.  WORTH IT."}
{"text":"Incredible restaurant!  Everything was just really, really good. My son said the gazpacho was the best soup he's ever had. The other soup was chicken consommé with zucchini and it was just tremendous as well. 

We had the raclette which was both very tasty and entertaining. The meats were great as was the cheese. 

For desert we shared the chocolate dome which gets melted at the table with butterscotch (perhaps the best I've ever had). 

I can't imagine a better restaurant in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Delightful meal in a lovely little restaurant. It's \"bring your own wine\" which is very nice since you can pick something you enjoy and pay much less for it. 
We had the raclette which is such a fun and delicious way to enjoy large amounts of melted cheese with a nice assortment of vegetables and meats. 
Our waiter was very pleasant without being overbearing. 
It was the most memorable part of our weekend trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Our meals were very good, however, I'd be lying if a said I was wowed by this place.  The fondue dishes, while tasty, were not overly distinguishable from other fondues I have had at other places. Our table was also not large enough to comfortably seat four people who were sharing fondue dishes.  I'd be inclined to try La Raclette again, but I think I might order something other than fondue next time."}
{"text":"Have been here three times and enjoyed it each time.  Sharing the raclette wheel is best with a group of four.  The salads, sides and desserts are creative and consistent.  Bring your own wine."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, delicious food and superior service. BYOB. Nice little store for beer and wine around the corner. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Un peu cher mais ça vaut la peine .la  nourriture est bonne. Pafait pour un grand groupe. Très bon service à la clientèle . Beau décor ."}
{"text":"I have been in La Raclette always on Friday or Saturday night when the restaurant is packed with large groups that I have been part of too. May be this is the reason I can not imagine this place as a perfect location for romantic dinner. Regardless of how busy is the restaurant the service is prompt and attentive, and the food is served timely. 
The restaurant focuses on traditional Swiss raclette and fondue, but there is also an amazing choice of appetizers and main courses that are cooked to perfection and are regularly updated on the menu. The food is ordered as small or big full course meal options. Highlights of my last visit are the red peppers soup and deer tartar. The raclette portion is very generous and preparing it is fun. 
For those who plan to eat raclette, research and choose carefully the wine pairing options. The restaurant is BYOB and the experience may be more authentic if you have the correct wine, white wine from Switzerland or alternately Austria was a perfect choice and it can be found in SAQ."}
{"text":"It was a warm, sweet, charming little place on a corner. We were greeted and served by the owners themselves who take great pride in their little gem of a restaurant.  And we all agreed it was probably the best meal we had in Montreal."}
{"text":"I am an incredibly picky eater, so a 5 star review from me is rare. We went here for dinner and because it was the Saturday before Valentine's Day, we ate off the special Valentine's Day menu. We were seated at a table which had rose petals on it...nice touch. Now, I am not a red meat eater, so although the menu was exceptionally limited for me, I know from experience that I will like any of the seafood options they have, which I did. I would love a chicken option, but chicken has never been on the menu in the 7 years we've come here.

The jar of pickles and onions they serve to each table is one of the reasons we dine here...they are the bomb. The bread is incredible, and each portion of my meal was fabulous. 

Our waiter, we found out later, is the artist who created the oil paintings hanging on the walls and they are so cool looking. He was fun, attentive, and knowledgable.  I love that it is a BYOW restaurant. 

The entertainment was perfect. Perfect for the venue. A couple playing a bass and an accordion. Her voice was angelic and they were not playing loudly, so it quietly complimented our experience.

The owner gave each party a box of two truffles...and I just finished mine today...delicious! 

What a tasty, genuine, beautiful experience all around. I swear, we drive up from New Hampshire just for an excuse to come to this place. A true favorite."}
{"text":"We came here for fondue, but ended up having raclette and it did not disappoint!
It is a pre fix menu that comes with a soup. It is also a BYOB, wine or beer. 

The waiter set up a small raclette melter-machine on our table. 
The cheese comes with cured meats and some vegs and potatoes. 
We had fun melting the cheese and pouring it on top of the potatoes and such.  
My favorite was the jar of cornichons the waiter put on our table. 

My only con about this place would be the price. I felt it was a little expensive, but given that you can BYOB it offsets the price. 

We would definitely return!"}
{"text":"J'ai bien apprécié ce resto. L'ambiance est génial devant une raclette de toute genre, c'est un Aporter votre vin pour bien pimenter votre soirée. Un petit conseil, je suggère y aller en groupe. 3/10"}
{"text":"The brunch menu is bit more pricey than your average breakfast place around Plateau, but the BYOB (Bring Your Own Bottle...of wine, not liquor) makes it a good place to have a nice group brunch with mimosas. 

The food is okay, I wasn't overly impressed with my choice, but other people seemed to enjoy their meals more than I did mine. The service is nice and friendly and the place atmosphere is great. 

It's definitely a good place to have a weekend family/friends/date brunch."}
{"text":"First time trying a raclette and i wasn't so bad. Its a BYOW restaurant which is a good point. We were four people.
I was the only one who took the grande table d'hôte so i had the beef tartar with two bread croutons that were burned.So i asked for a waiter, not ours, if i could have other croutons and my boyfriend asked for more bread and butter and the waiter was so rude and so sarcastic it wasn't pleasant at all. When he came back with my appetizer he said that these croutons were the last ones in the kitchen.. Something i hardly believe. The other people took the petite table d'hôte and they liked their potage à la courge. I tried it too it was good indeed. Two of us had the Raclette duo and the two other took the émincé de veau and another main dish i can't remember the name but i know that the meat was lamb and that it was grilled. My boyfriend who had the grilled lamb dish asked for it to be medium cooked and it wasn't, it was more like well done. The restaurant itself is noisy but you can still have a conversation, it's dark and cozy just not a place for a romantic dinner, more like a dinner with friends."}
{"text":"My favourite high end BYOB in Montreal. I mostly eat my Vancouver version of vegetarian, meaning I eat fish. The fish here was probably the best I've had in Montreal. The table d'hote was well worth the money. Choose the chocolate mousse for dessert. The service was friendly and attentive. Good for groups or intimate settings. All four of us really enjoyed our meals. The lamb shank was another favourite."}
