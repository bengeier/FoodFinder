{"text":"This place has made a total come back. New owners have put it back on the map. I used to come here when it first opened. It was fun and clean with great food. After it sold it seemed like it fell off for a while.

When I saw the new ownership sign we decided to give it another try. I'm really glad we did. We like local owner restaurants over chains.  This time it was back to its old glory. There were 8 of us. Got seated quickly and received great service.  Only ordered appetizers which were excellent. 

All of us had a good time got to interact with the manager maybe owner. That's always a good touch. Helps you know they care. I'm planning to go back and try dinner. Good to know there is another local option out here now.

Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I love the live entertainment every weekend! I always get great service and the food is awesome. The new patio looks amazing and I love to hang there."}
{"text":"Luv this place! Food is good, staff is great! 
Nice place to hang out, live entertainment every wknd! Betta does a great job! Luv Danny too, he's the BEST!"}
{"text":"I decided to meet a buddy and his parents for some $0.40 wings on a beautiful day, so the patio at Slim and Chubby's was our agreed meeting place.

My friend and I ordered 4 different flavors of 6 wings each.  We ordered hot, Arizona Blaze, garlic parm and six pepper blend.  His parents just got the garlic parm.  They were terrible.  Either they were fried too long or the fryer's temperature was too high.  Just way too crispy, small and  not juicy.  The hot tasted like they were spun only in Tabasco sauce.  No kick whatsoever.

The service was non-existent.  My feiend's mom waited a long time for water.  We asked for empty baskets for our eaten wings and only 10 minutes later they magically appeared.  It wasn't particularly busy so there shouldn't have been such a lag time for our request to be fulfilled.

Overall it was a negative experience and we'll be visiting local competitors next time my friend and I decide to get wings."}
{"text":"Nice clean sports bar.  The staff is great and we like the food too.  Good place to watch a band as well.  I would echo earlier comments that the new ownership has breathed life back into this neighborhood bar"}
{"text":"Could be better at what they do.  Could be worse.  If you are looking fir a bar and food it works."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood type sports bar. Came with my 15 year old grandson on a road trip. Lots of happy tables. Many flat screen TVs. He ordered the double decker BLT and so did I. The food was alright. The vibe was great and servers were fast and genuinely nice folks. If you are in Strongsville give them a try. You may feel like you are at one of your favorite hometown pubs."}
{"text":"I love Slim & Chubby's! Rare to find a restaurant that has really good food and also really good live entertainment! I like Thursdays when they have an excellent dj and the crowd is younger than me, I don't care for 80's music but the cover bands they have are really good just too much 80's music for me and the crowd is a bit older, but its good that people my age and older have a nightlife spot and very rare in the 'burbs. The food is much better than bar food - it is not intended to be a 5-star restaurant other reviewers! However, the burgers are truly 5-star, great selection of specialty burgers too!!! Fave is the one with blue cheese topping, its excellent. Staff is wonderful, some reviewers a little harsh! Yes, like any place they might have a bad server here and there but they don't last long! The ones I met have been there awhile and were all excellent - friendly, they have a ton of regulars and the bar staff seemed to know everyone and gave everyone friendly hellos!! And a few hotties working there too!  Also, a nice private area for groups that was booked 3/4 times I was there, nice patio area and a true \"Cheers\" neighborhood feel - that delivers a lot more!!!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place because I could pretty much walk here. I don't. The food is just, eh. The service is barely better. The same people sit at the bar and bitch the whole time about one thing or another and talk across the bar so everyone is in on the conversation. I like a beer and burger joint, but not this one.  The wings are average at best, and the rest of the menu is predictable and blah. The staff would rather sit and talk and drink then serve customers."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad.   Service was awful.  Not busy at all for Saturday night dinner.   We were notified that they were out of the entree 20 minutes after we ordered."}
{"text":"Went there with a group and I am not impressed.  They seamed to not have enough staff.  It took a long time to order and a long time to prepare.  Some people in the group where done before others were served.  Staff seamed flustered."}
{"text":"Not good not bad.  I frequent here because of friends and bands.  Other than that, I'm not too impressed.  I've ordered several food items on repeat visits, none are exemplary.  They are all pretty much \"bar food\", frozen and reheat options.  The only one I've actually liked is the Chicken Parmasan.  We did get the Prime Rib special the other day....IDK why I thought that was a good idea at the time.  It too tasted old and reheated.  The drinks are ok, although very sparse on alcohol.  You are better off with the beer specials.  But I don't drink beer....so hmmmff.  The atmosphere is dark and the place could do with a good scrub down.  Like I said,I go there to be with friends...otherwise, it's really not my type of place."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. We were just yelled at by the bartender because she charged us for a ton of drinks we didn't order... all because there were two other people with the same name. I get it. It happens. But the bartender decided to yell at us and the owner then berated us until we left. It was horrible. Such a disappointing end to what was an otherwise good night. Would never recommend to go here. Ever. Also, we experienced another fight while we were waiting for our tabs. Terrible times a million."}
{"text":"I went here for a Brown's game with a few buddies of mine. We split a nacho appetizer and it was HUGE. It was really good too. I got the fish diner with fries and it was pretty good for an american style bar. I know everyone else was satisfied with their food as well. The beer special was cheap, 1.50 for Coors light so we were buying each other rounds and having a good time. And this is for all you young men, there are cougars everywhere! HA lol"}
{"text":"This place is the beezneez great drink prices and fabulous regulars:) the bartenders are super nice and quick and as a plus there are plenty of pokemon near by with a pokemon gym right across the street"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Monday waited 10 minutes for waitress to come to our table she handed us menus and said I'll be back for your drink order we waited and waited finally I went to the bar to get 2 drinks. Then we waited and waited again finally the waitress came we ordered 2 more drinks. Not like the time before when we were here that waitress Alex was very attentive never had to wait for her. Guess they need more girls like Alex. Next time we go back I'll look for Alex."}
{"text":"Servers talk behind the bar and don't come to your table. You have to go grab your own beer or food if you want to be served. They don't even give you a menu, you are supposed to guess what they serve if you want to order something."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our visit! Went on Thursday and had half price appetizers! A group of 7 and all enjoyed multiple orders of different appetizers to share all were just great!! Good drink selection and well worth the money. A good time was had . We're coming back!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped by on a Saturday night with friends for dinner.  We ordered dinner and the waitress disappeared.  I lost it when people that came in after us got their food before our dinner arrived.  I sent mine back as I will not pay for \"POOR SERVICE\"!!

The food finally arrived but it was way too late to save this place as I will not be back!!  Great crowd but they need to work on delivering to the people that are paying for service!!  To add insult to an already bad situation when the waitress brought our final bill they added $1.00 surcharge to every beer since the final bill was printed after 9:00 pm.  I asked for a manager and she explained the surcharges.  I explained that our 5 beers were ordered and drank before 9:00 pm.  She agrees to refund me $4.00 and to get out in a timely manner I requested that she just give the $4.00 to the waitress."}
{"text":"Better food than you'd expect for a bar/restaurant.  Yes, they have the typical wings/burgers/sandwiches, which are all very good but they also have nightly specials that are not your typical bar food. Most times a bar tries to incorporate \"regular\" food into their menu it usually isn't very good, in my past experience.  They usually should stick to the grilled/fried stuff.  But that's NOT the case here.  One night a week they have stuffed peppers that are almost as good as my mom used to make.  I had the city chicken last night and it was delicious.  See what I mean? Not your typical bar food at all!  They have a lobster bisque that is seriously one of the best I've had.  Not the normal lobster bisque in that the lobster is shredded, not chunked like you usually find but still, the taste is really good.  Their taco Tuesdays are not your typically taco Tuesday.  Their tacos come in small or large sizes, soft or hard shell and when I say the large is a large, I'm not kidding!  My husband got a taco on a recent trip.  He got the large because he was hungry and had also ordered appetizers because he figured the taco although it said it was a large wouldn't be enough and boy, was he wrong!  He almost couldn't finish it and the app he ordered.  It was about half the size of a dinner plate - more like a burrito.  Prices are reasonable, too.  I think my city chicken dinner was $8.95 and came with 2 sides.  I forget how much the burrito is but I know they are not expensive.  If you order the daily specials you certainly get your money's worth.  Drinks are good. I usually have beer when we go but I've had a few shots such as lemon drops and they were always well made.  My only complaint is that when they have live entertainment, the place gets really crowded and it's usually standing room only which also makes it hard to get to the bar.  They do have a nice stage area for the bands, though and it is a good place to go see a band, just come early!"}
{"text":"Great food at fantastic prices. Wednesday night car shows! Lots of live bands as well. Great bar"}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this bar & grille. For starters, the people are genuinely friendly and greet you at entry. Service is on point, as we have never had to wait longer than 20 mins to get food, and drinks are served quickly. The food is absolutely delicious (it's American cuisine / finger food) each and every time we have ordered, and the location is great in proximity to shopping, etc.  There is plenty of parking in the front and back lots!!

This is definitely your neighborhood type of Cheers."}
{"text":"The food isn't too bad but it's pretty basic.  The one positive thing I will say about this place is that they have live entertainment on the weekends, but this also drives a very unusual crowd."}
{"text":"This place really stinks. The service was awful. The frumpy waitron seemed pained by us being there and rarely even looked in  our direction. We sat with empty glasses for at least ten minutes. Had to go the bar to get our cocktails. The bartender was fast, but then he put the drinks on the table tab and winked at the waitron. WTF? Needless to say, no one got the tip. I saw many tables gazing longingly at the server who could obviously care less about being there. 

And the food? Straight out of a can. The bar just seemed kinda dirty... like a barn or something. The locals warned us! We really should have stayed away. The name of the joint was a red flag as well. Lesson learned."}
