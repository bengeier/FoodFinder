{"text":"Came by with a colleague to check it out for lunch. A very cool concept and a great vibe, but prices are EXPENSIVE. Definitely not a lunch spot I can see myself frequenting in the financial district considering all the options available.   I had the ramen which was definitely tasty, but I paid over $18 with tax for it!   Might return for dinner, but more likely to visit the actual restaurant at these prices!"}
{"text":"Really impressive and creative concept. Met a colleague for lunch here yesterday, so many options from some of the top chefs in Toronto you don't have to pre-agree on eating the same as the company you are with. Service was quick and easy to find seating. Had the truffle gnocchi from Boemo that was definitely worth going back for."}
{"text":"We went on the first Saturday that they were open, so met many of the venues we wanted to sample not actually open. You'd think that would be a massive letdown, but it just gives us another reason to go back.   We managed to sample savoury food from three suppliers: Cherry Street Bar-B-Que, Shari, and Colibrí. And an abundance of sweets from Short & Sweet, with a coffee from Bulldog on the way out.   Shari was a miss. The fish was warm. Too warm. We pretty much threw 3/4 of the dish out. Colibrí was going through teething pains, forgot our order and then rushed it, but the flavours were there and I cannot really fault  first weekend opening bumps. Cherry St was the standout. The brisket was beyond delicious! The guys behind the counter were proud of their product and it showed. We would return just for them, though we have so many other places to try.   Short & Sweet has so much to offer! Cupcakes, cakes, bars, cookies, and amazing, though unconventional, butter tarts. All of it was super sweet but oh so delicious! And nut free!   Bulldog provided the perfect end to an enjoyable eating experience. We look forward to trying Dailo, Reyna, Little Khao, etc. upon our return!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and great relaxed environment. Highly recommend. The is approximately 10 different food choices and 2 bars. All food appears to be great quality, will make another stop here on a short trip to Toronto"}
{"text":"I have now been here several times since their official opening, and am well on my way to trying all of the restaurants :) Weekdays seem to be too crowded for my liking (like all the other food courts around here), but on Saturday it is beautifully quiet. Also, the patio. COME."}
{"text":"I went for lunch on a weekday.  The place gets packed on weekdays, given it's location. The premise is kind of like a food court for millennials with significant disposable income.  Had ramen from...the ramen place. It was good, but nothing fantastic.  All the food looked really good, but most of the items start in the $15+ range, so it's a little on the pricey side for lunch."}
{"text":"Mr. Musk must have thrown the drinks menu along the roadster on that space rocket......ASTRONOMICAL PRICES  God I could've went to the crock rock on a Wednesday and get obliterated with the money that I spent on TWO pints. LOL  Anyways lovely venue, proper vendors, nice crowd, enjoying the professional attire from patrons. Gorgeous patrons at times.  Funny fact: The guy of Cherry St BBQ, buddy smile a bit that is why people are gettin tacos next to you cause the chubby Mexican guy is a bit tad more cheerful. LMAOCOPTER!  I hope to win lottario sometime soon so I can come back and spend 100 dollars on a decent meal. Chers"}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 4 stars for variety and being the first of its kind - but the price kills it so really its a 3.5 imo. However, aside from the cost (which is different for everyone) any foodie would love to come here, there are so many options as to what to eat, it's overwhelming in an exciting way.   My boyfriend took me here for my birthday, we came on a Wednesday afternoon (after the office lunch rush) and it was pretty dead which I liked. I didn't have to wait in line to order or get my food, lots of seating to choose from and quiet enough to hear my date. Although there are many choices, it's expensive for what you get. I ordered a burger with a side of fries and it came out to just under $20. The burger was good, but I felt like it could've been bigger for that price tag.  This wouldn't be my top dinner choice, but it would be a place I'd take my friends and family that visit me or if a special restaurant pops up in."}
{"text":"Beat soppressata pizza I have had in Toronto so far! Absolutely delicious - the salami was nice and spicy and the crust was thin."}
{"text":"Assembly Chef's Hall is the perfect place to go if you just can't decide what to have for dinner. This place has every - BBQ (Cherry Street BBQ), pizza (The Good Son), ramen (Ramen Isshin), Thai (Little Khao) and fried chicken (Love Chix) to name but a few.  The venue itself is an open concept self-serve restaurant and I love how a group of people can get whatever they choose and eat together in the communal dining area. The 17 restaurants, eating area and bar take up more or less the whole ground floor of this office building, where the exterior belies the deliciousness within.  I had the fried chicken sandwich from Love Chix and my friend had a rack of ribs from Cherry Street BBQ. Both were delicious in their own right and weren't overly pricy - $14 for the sandwich and around $9 for a portion of side ribs. Reasonably good value for money when you take into account the convenient location and spacious venue.   I'm looking forward to trying some of the other restaurants here since they all looked delicious. I was also delighted to see Bulldog Coffee right by the front door, as I used to frequent their old location on Church when I lived in the area. Try their coffee - all shots are poured double and prepared with care. Their prices aren't too bad either!  Note: Closed Sundays."}
{"text":"Well, this space is pretty cool. They did a really good job laying it out, decorating, lots of seating, etc. Tons of food options too. I got the Lebanese tacos (chicken) and OMG, they were one of the best things I have ever eaten. Seriously, the flavors were so amazing and I loved all the toppings. The taco was smaller, but the filling is VERY generous. I got two and and I was full. My wife had the fried chicken sandwich from Love Chix and it was very good, but umm it's just the sandwich. A side is $4? A bit ridiculous, which brings me to the prices.  When I first read the reviews I have to admit I was rolling my eyes a bit because I thought people were being ridiculous about the prices. But they're right. I would give it 5 stars, but the prices are TOO HIGH. I got a beer and it was 11.25 (plus tip)! What?! A beer at a restaurant isn't even that much. I can almost get two beers for that price some places. My tacos were $12ish, which wasn't too bad, but still. The fried chicken sandwich for $15? No, just no. At that price you need to offer a side with it. Again, compared to a restaurant where someone is waiting on you, serving you, these prices don't make sense."}
{"text":"This place is a very cool spot in the middle of the city, for locals to grab lunch or a quick bite between clients. There is a lot of fare to choose from: Mexican, Lobster rolls, Ramen, Sushi, etc.   The vendors don't take cash, so have your card handy. They do have a bar downstairs near the seating area with a pretty extensive selection. If you are there during peak lunch or dinner time, scoring seating for a group can be a pain.  I ordered a fish taco with a Mexican coke, and my cousins got ramen and chia pudding. I think if I were to go back, I would hit up the Mediterranean or Sushi. For my meal it was $12 Canandian, $9 USD."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing. However, prices are way too high for assembly dishes"}
{"text":"There are no words to describe how much this was needed. Absolutely amazing atmosphere, the food stalls are all spectacular and delicious, spacious and with free wifi.   Must-go-tos are Bulldog Coffee and Ramen Isshin!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this concept! Funnily enough, I had a similar vision a while back with a bit of a social enterprise spin... So this place is particularly near and dear to my heart!  Assembly Chef's Hall has amazing vibes - every time I've been, it has been filled with people who are chatting, laughing, and just overall having a great time! Only downfall is that there are limited seats and oftentimes it's difficult finding an area to sit.  So far, I've been to Bulldog for their amazing lattes and rainbow lattes, Shari for chirashisushi, and Tachi for stand up omakase! Next up on my to try list is Bluenose Lobster for the sinfully buttery lobster rolls and DaiLo for the truffle fried rice."}
{"text":"So this is a luxurious, high end food court. You walk around to each stall until you float into something that tickle your fancy. After you grab food, you have to roam around until you find a place to sit down.   Except your typical main dish would run between $15-$30 Drinks run you another $5 A bigger eater, add another $10 for a snack  So in a 'food court', you are spending $30 for a meal.  This would be a great place if you are looking to eat different style of food in one sitting, and have a large group, so everyone pays for itself. In terms of the dollar value - I may choose another sit-down restaurant instead.  I ordered from Isshin Ramen - I've been to its main location before.  For the same price, it is half the size of what I had in its main location. I am a small eater to begin with, and I was quickly hungry afterward too. The flavour is still great, and amazing - portions were the discrepancies."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Amazing place. Such a great selection of very interesting foods and drinks.   Bought from Shari. They primarily serve chirashi, which is basically a bowl/box of rice with premium fish.  Very delicious.    Cant wait to go back and try some of the other places."}
{"text":"Great for lunches with co-workers - each person can choose what they want in an upscale, trendy space.  Gets a bit noisy during peak hours, so go early or late."}
{"text":"Tried assembly today expecting it to be like the multitude of food courts that have sprung up in NYC. There isn't many food booths to choose from. Yes,  this has a nicer décor & seating than most in NYC but do people want to pay $20 + for lunch to queue & bring their own tray to your table?. I had a chicken sandwich at the chicken stand which was excellent but not worth $16. It is $18 with a small side. With a drink it would have put me at $25. For that I will go to a sit down restaurant not a food court.   Toronto always seems to miss the mark when doing things. A lot of the spaces were empty & there were not many people there at lunch. What we need is a food court of existing restaurants for meals around $10. If NYC can do it why can't we?"}
{"text":"Finally, a food hall which does not contain fast food franchises in the Financial District!!!!! If you are looking for cheap eats, this food hall definitely does not provide that.  I like the concept of Assembly Chef's Hall. Local business/restaurants opening up food stalls serving the downtown core of Toronto. It is connected along with the PATH (just follow 111 Richmond St sign) It is convenient to have 18 local business in one location. I am happy this food hall exists.  I tried Cherry St. BBQ on my first visit and got the pull porked sandwich. If anyone was wondering what \"S/W\" means on their menu, its means sandwich. The employee was great explaining to me about the menu. The total came out to be $13.50. Yes, I also think the price is quite steep for a sandwich. Overall, the sandwich was great. The pork was tender and it went well with the BBQ sauce they added on top. My only regret on asking them is to get more of that BBQ sauce on the side to dip the sandwich in.  The ambiance is great. The seating area is spacious with the bench style tables. They also have employees working to take away trays and clean the tables.   However, there are cons: apparently, most vendors are cashless so they take card only. This is because the property management takes a portion of their sales. (what i was told). And finally, Price. Definitely on the high side. Don't expect a cheap meal here compared to other food courts.  Overall, I like the concept and will be back to try more vendors out!"}
{"text":"Pretty good selection and variety of food. This is a trendy and hipster food court style location that mimics little kitchen stations with different cuisines that range from a sushi-set prepared by a chef in front of you to fried chicken to brisket burgers to a bar to a Lebanese kitchen. This is the best place to show up to when your girlfriend says \"I'll eat anything you're having\" and is indecisive. You know what I'm talking about guys.... I tried their brisket burger with their BBQ Beans and it was a phenomenal melt-in-your-mouth experience, you need the BBQ beans to counteract the spicy sauce in the burger."}
{"text":"Obviously I can't speak to every restaurant in the hall, but I absolutely love the food (and vibe!). Harkening to places like Chelsea Market in NYC or Grand Central Market in DTLA, this food hall is all kinds of delicious eclectic food with a comfortable, casual (and not too noisy) atmosphere. It's good for conversation, even if you have a group over six. I had the Cherry Street BBQ brisket (which I can't recommend enough-- just don't pair it with the coleslaw-- and a Bulldog Coffee to go. I used to like Bulldog, but third wave coffee has evolved beyond them; hence the 4 star review instead of 5 stars. Everything else from Little Khao to Colibri looked and smelled fantastic. So dive in! It's hard not to land on your feet here."}
{"text":"Just stumbled in... Whoa, it's like someone went through the most popular blogto best-of lists and got someone on each list to set up a food stand in the same food court and paired them with terrible music."}
{"text":"It's the smorgasbord of trendy eats, beer and cafeteria seating. Need I say more? Go. Especially on Saturday when everything else in the neighbourhood is closed. Even if they weren't, I'd still go."}
{"text":"Good, but not great due to the value for dollar that you get.   Four of us came, each spent about $20 for lunch, and all felt somewhat deflated.   The current free coffee promo is what bumped them from a three to a four."}
{"text":"Love it! Super concept for the bustling downtown lunch crowd. Great sampling of some of Toronto's top restaurant menus. There is definitely a lot of variety as well which is perfect for the discerning foodie or those who can't decide in advance what to order.   Note: If visiting during peak hours it can get VERY loud.  Environment is casual (a lot of family style seating)."}
{"text":"It's a pretty neat food court and it's definitely on the higher end in terms of prices, atmosphere, and quality. I went around noon which is totally the WRONG time to go, haha. It was crowded with people who work nearby so it was a bit hard to move around. However, it got noticeably less busy around 1 PM. I'd definitely recommend going off-hours since you'll have a better chance of finding a seat. There's plenty of indoor seating, but with good weather, the outdoor patio offers even more tables and seating options.   In terms of the food, there's a variety of higher end options, ranging from sushi, ramen, Thai, Italian, burgers, desserts, etc.   However, it's -1 full star for not accepting cash. This is the very first place I've ever experienced this and my god I HOPE this doesn't become a \"trend\" among other restaurants and stores. Even if you see nothing wrong with it because you mostly use cards yourself, consider places that don't accept cards (cash only) and how you'd probably get annoyed too.  Overall, it's a tasty though expensive place to grab some food. Instead of paying $20+ to sit in a crowded, humid, loud food court, I may just head to a sit-down restaurant next time."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised that the ribs weren't dry at all. The pulled pork sandwich and fries from Reyna was ok. Texture of the meat was nice and tender but I wasn't a fan of the seasoning. Lobster roll was decent.. obviously wasn't the best but not the worst. I would definitely return because of the variety of food options to choose from and the overall atmosphere. Good music, good vibe, and decent amount of seating. The crowd was great - you'll see a lot of afterwork crowd from the financial district swinging by for a bite and beer (especially on a Friday). Food and drinks can be a tad overpriced but I mean..it's downtown Toronto. $10 for a pint of beer it is! 18 bucks for a pulled pork sandwich and fries? I guess.. At least you don't have to wait for 20 to 30 minutes just to get some dinner? If you are looking for a place to lounge around and hang with a few friends over some drinks and don't really care about being on a budget then this place is for you."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and I can't wait to go back. The concept is really smart and the layout is great . I like that it's a different vibe from the usual financial district restaurants. The atmosphere is  vibrant, love the live DJ concept, it has the nice green indoor, a little casual, a little bougie basically something for everyone. No reservations needed. The food options are endless  all your friends will find something they like even the picky one or the ones who like to drink their meals"}
{"text":"Toronto shows how it's done, busting out the most chic food court this side of the Atlantic. From burgers to lobsters, it has an incredible range of chef-created delicacies, beverages and stylish spaces to sit. This is definitely not your high school cafeteria."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday night for dinner at 6PM. I was extremely disappointed. A lot of the stalls were closed or menu items were sold out already, so options were limited. It was pricey, I spent $25 for fish baja taco and guacamole with chips. Not sure I would go back for the taco, but I may go back to try the other vendors that were sold out and closed. My friend described the set up as cafeteria style, I have to agree but for an urban demographic."}
{"text":"The selection is a bit shi shi fru fru for my tastes.  Also, very expensive for what it is.  I can get a good ramen outside for $13 even in downtown while theirs go for about $17.  There was a stall that made fries and those were actually quite good."}
{"text":"A little pricey ( lunch is about $25) and lines are long but a good place to go if you and your coworkers cant decide what to eat - large selection and everything was decent"}
{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelming.  I came here with friends from Montreal as I was excited to show them how diverse the food scene is in Toronto and I was sadly disappointed.  I have been in a real food hall before and the food there was exciting delicious inspired and fresh.  however the food here does tastes like something from a food court.  It is dry tasteless and really small portions.  But most importantly the food is also extremely overpriced.  So what is the point of going here if you could just go home and get the same food delivered at your door for the same price.  That is my value proposition to whoever created this place.  We had the tacos from Colobris, rice dish from Khao SAN road and pulled pork sandwich from Cherry Street bbq.  I wish it was more of an experience to sing home about but I will caution anyone that this is an underwhelming but novel experience.  Save your money and go to a food court nearby."}
{"text":"Food halls like this are taking off all across North America- Vancouver, Toronto, Chicago, Denver, etc. Assembly Chef's Hall provides an array of cuisine choices and full menu options- appetizer, entree, desserts, and drinks.   Overall, if you love options, open concept seating, and a fun atmosphere. Go here. It is a little more expensive than a true food court but is in line price wise if you went to singular restaurant. If you want to try an interesting new food concept. Go here.   This is my second time at Assembly- both visits provided delicious food and a fun atmosphere. I was a little disappointed during my second visit to see that the menus don't change much weeks apart. I think the compelling feature of these halls is the options provided which starts to disappear when the menus or restaurants don't change. I hope as this concept evolves, they will work out some of kinks in the overall delivery.  Now for the food- my first visit, I ordered the chorizo gnocchi from resto boemo. It was fantastic, not too strong, well flavored balanced and complimented each other well, and the perfect texture.   My second visit I ordered the green curry from Little Khao. The flavor of the curry was delicious and the right spice level. I wish there were more veggies in it!"}
{"text":"Had the ramen from ramen isshin. Portion was really small. Nothing special. Would rather go to santouka or sansotei.  Came back and had chirachi-zushi from Shari. Omg worst chirachi-zushi ever. Very small portion for $18. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Toronto finally gets this highly anticipated upscale food court located in the Google building across from the Sheraton. Even though it's not completely open yet, what is currently there is very intriguing and is setting a high bar for expectations.  This place will be in the millennial's yelp bookmark for sure. It's got ample space, quality food, and some booze to boot.  But be prepared to make in rain with some $20s like you're going to your BFF's bachelor or bachelorette party.    Lots of potential here.  You're getting restaurant quality food at restaurant prices for a self serve/quick serve environment.  I think Assembly Hall fills a gap needed in Toronto while we wait with great expectations of Eataly coming to the city. But we're going to have to see if they can overcome the food price sensitivity of the locals here.  Hopefully Google employees will bring their wallets.  The restaurateurs are shelling out the same for rent here as owning an entire restaurant, so it's going to take regular traffic to keep this place here.  They're almost ready for you yelp freaks to get your freak on here.  Release the hounds.  To the top of the Yelp front page you go...Good luck Chef's."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place. It's like going to a fancy food truck rally except it's permanent booth like stations. We arrived on a Thursday night around 8pm. It says online they close at 10pm but some of the food vendors were closing and stopped serving food. There were plenty of people walking around that these business missed out on including my group of 4. That was a bit of a disappointment. The food we did have was wonderful. I got the hot lobster roll which was my favorite item. Then purchased a pulled pork sandwich which I thought had a wonderful intense smoke flavor. The coleslaw they put on top was tasty. The food is pricey but I kind of expected that reading other reviews. They except cash and credit at at the bar only so you have to pay at the food booths  with credit card. My other gripe is that some of the vendors don't use gloves, they just put food together with their hands. Grabbing into condiments and sides contaminating  everything fingering the food. That kinda of grossed me out a bit."}
{"text":"We came here for a special event - stadium eats themed chefs party on a Sat evening. Parking around here can be tricky in financial district on weekdays but on weekend I parked under the First Canadian Place near by and it's $12 for a full day.   Since this is a special event, we were each given five food coupons and a drink coupon (included in the tickets). Together we redeemed 2 beers and 1 dish from just about every single station. Pretty sweet deals. But I've heard on regular days, the price here can be a bit high, hence the 4 stars.   There were lots of seatings indoor and outdoor. It's clean, roomy and modern, definitely a high-end ish food court different the food court you typically see in the mall.  Out of the food we tried, my favourite is the mini lobster roll from the Lobster station, a papaya tempura kind of thing from am Asian food themed station and the brunch crepe from Hibiscus. Overall everything is pretty decent. Nothing stella but for a workday I imagine this could be a popular lunch spot.   Would love to try again when it's not a special event day."}
{"text":"Cool concept. It's kind of like a hipster Marche movenpick.   The prices are a bit high for what you get, but the selection and ambiance are top notch. Many of the businesses that are on my \"to visit\" list are here so it was a nice surprise when I found this place accidentally. The whole area is so nicely furnished, decorated and cleaned.   It's nice that some of the stalls have examples of the dishes on display, because some of the portions looked a little small.   There are so many positives that it cancels all the negative things I can think about. I will be back.   Protip: they are cashless here."}
{"text":"3.5/5 Super cool concept to have this in the heart of the financial district. Located in the same building as google on Adelaide. When you walk in on a weekday lunch, it is BUSY. So many people browsing around to see what they want for lunch. You have cuisine's ranging from tacos to sushi, to raman to asian fuision. There are also sweets (cupcakes and other desserts as well). it is a really cool concept because it's essentially a space where restaurants are confined in a pop up space, but still serving restaurant quality items. There is also a bar located inside the assembly chefs hall for those interested for a mid day booze.  We tried dai lo and the mexican place. Both were ok... I think i would prefer to have dai lo at their original restaurant... we tried their version of peking wing duck and it was good except they ran out of the wrap!! We were really looking forward to having peking duck for lunch! portion sizes are also on the smaller end... especially for the price you pay. Also tried the truffle fried rice.. very tasty, but it was done in like 5 spoonfuls!!! Containers were tiny and pricing is expensive for the amount you get.  The mexican place was cool because they served fresh tortilla and you see them making it and warming it up on a spinner.. fish taco was good but had a little too much pickeled veggie on top for my liking.. Would come back for the atmosphere but pricing of the food is $$$$ too much for lunch."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is exquisite! The unique selections of vendors are up to par of the city's popular food trends. The only thing, it is quite costly for a food hall. For the price, you can have the experience in the actual restaurant with full service."}
{"text":"What a great concept! Restaurant quality food with the speed of fast food. A perfect addition to the financial district for those who are looking for a delicious lunch and need to quickly return to work.   The atmosphere of the Assembly Hall is upbeat. The decor is on point and there is plenty of seating, an issue that other Toronto food courts have. I love that there are multiple seating areas with their own bar, this will be a great location for after work dinner and drinks with co-workers.  I can't wait to come back for the grand opening and checkout the new vendors!"}
{"text":"Oh wow! Can we PLEASE get a group of restaurants to create something this amazing in Oklahoma? I had vegetarian-friendly baked falafel with spicy tahini and an amazing salad from Mira Mira, hubby got  tacos from Colibri. Quality of food was high, prices were great! What a fun place to come and eat, hang out, people watch and Be!"}
{"text":"We need more of these in Toronto. You can call this a food court, but really it has a sampling of the best restaurants in Toronto all serving 2 or 3 dishes for lunch or dinner.   The space is much bigger than I thought and surprisingly I was not the only mom with babe in arms. There was space for a stroller.  Check out the website for a listing of their offerings. My stomach is only so big.   My friend got a lobster roll $20 but it was quite small. We went back to Boemo for gnocchi to share. My favourite was the combo plate at Reyna. There was a quinoa salad (with fried chickpeas and all sorts of fun stuff), chicken taco on homemade naan (it was a little tough), and a lamb baklava (sweet and savoury with pistachio cream) $16.99  Too stuffed for dessert grabbed coffee from Bulldog coffee. Don't forget to download the app to get a coupon for $5 at Bulldog Nutbar or Toyko Smoke.   Come here for a special occasion lunch (it's kind of pricey for everyday). Worth the trek."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some friends. I had tried to order ahead on their app but kept getting an error message. I was planning on getting ramen, but upon arriving the line was quite long. I had to opt for a shorter line for the sake of time. I ended up grabbing a fried chicken sandwich from Love Chix and it was great. The flavours were well balanced and it had a nice kick to it without being too spicy.  The menu options here are a little pricier compared to other downtown \"food courts\" but the food you get is definitely one of the better lunches you can get without going to a proper sit down establishment."}
{"text":"This place is like a foodie heaven. As you enter, it can get a little overwhelming trying to decide what to eat. But the best part is, you can walk right up to the bar and ask \"Hi, can you please recommend what white or bubbly will go well with my black sesame tan tan ramen? Then after you place you glass on a table, you can decide if you want lobster, fried chicken, truffle fried rice from Dailo. It's just a great evening even coming here by myself!   The tables are first come first serve. So coming alone, I used my Mackage jacket and scarf to save a two seater as the seats are taken quickly.   From ramen Isshin, I asked the staff which one is most popular and she recommended the black sesame tan tan, so I ordered that. Broth was tasty. Noodles were chewy, just a little smaller portion for $16 compared to the other ramen places that I normally go to.   I've also ordered a CHIRASHIZUSHI (small) $18.50 from Shari, chef is the same owner as Shoushin. It was okay. The tobiko was fresh, I find the sushi rice a little sour, maybe too much vinegar?   Definitely worth checking it out this new venue!"}
{"text":"In town staying at Sheraton Cener across the street..  great space, people, food and drink."}
{"text":"YES. YES.  Everything about this place is a thumbs up! Whether you work in the area or are with friends who just so happen to crave everything!   It's more so an upscale, rustic, hipster vibe cafeteria BUT with higher quality options. As seen in the photo, a few friends and I decide to try a little bit of everything. This is how I'd rate the meals in order from favourite to least:  1) Gnocchi ($20) 2) Margarita Pizza ( $16 - SMALL) 3) Parmesan fries ($8 - HUGE PORTION) 4) Baja Tacos ($14 for 2) : Not a fan of the taco shell   Chef's assembly lets you get anything from Italian to Japanese food, you're bound to find something you want... or maybe just try everything! There's also a bar accessible so you can add some flavour to your meal.   Not only is the environment amazing, there was an outdoor patio that is just perfect for the summer! I can't wait to go back over throughout the course of the summer"}
{"text":"Super fun vibe, really feeling the live dj!  Had a great time trying a few of the booths, the stand out being the lamb baklava from Reyna! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Music is a little too loud, but otherwise this place is great. Amazing food at reasonable prices. Really modern and hopping ambience. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Overpriced food right in the middle of the path. I tried the isshin ramen, sushi, and bluenose lobster at the hall and have yet to be impressed as the quality doesn't seem to be replicated in the food court environment. Though the actual atmosphere for a food court is very nice I have to say."}
{"text":"How many times has this happened to you?  You: \"Hey, what do you want to eat?\"  Bf/gf/friend/dog: \"I don't know.\"   No longer do you have to play 20 questions to get an answer. Take them right to Assembly Chef's Hall! It's the answer to all of your \"I don't know\" hassles. There's representation of cuisines from all over the world, there's bound to be something for everyone. Tacos, pizza, burgers, American BBQ, Thai, Chinese, ramen, sushi...If Toronto is all about diversity, then Assembly Chef's Hall should be its official headquarters.   For your beer-swilling, meat-eater, \"salads are the devil\" bro: brisket at Cherry Street BBQ, fried chicken at Love Chix, and multiple drafts on tap. For your hipster, vegan, latte art loving buddy: matcha chia pudding at Mira Mira, avocado toast at Nutbar, and caffeinated beverages in all different shapes and sizes.  The hall itself is very trendy. It's like a high-end food court with restaurant style quality and prices. Even during the lunch rush with hundreds of suits, we found spaces to sit no problem. My dining companion and I had the privilege of trying the $14 \"42 Ingredient Salad\" from Hibiscus and the $30 truffle mushroom gnocchi from Boemo.   The salad was really good, for a salad. It was filling and bursting with different colours, textures, and tastes. But it couldn't hold a candle to the gnocchi, which was decadent, marvelous, and had me shamelessly trying to scoop up tiny bits of sauce from my companion's plate to savour that flavour.  Washing all that down, we had $5 handmade ginger ales from Ramen Isshin. Very gingery, not very sweet, and perfectly refreshing.   Assembly Chef's Hall might be expensive but as a frequent \"I don't know\" answerer, I think I've found my place in this world.   (25/100) - 2018"}
{"text":"I went to their Chef's Hall tasting events ($30 for 6 items) tasters and it was totally worth. I had a chance to sample a lot of different items they had and was completely stuffed by end. Considering that a lot of these vendors stem from popular Toronto restaurants, I wasn't surprised by how good the food was. Completely fell in love with parmesan brussel sprouts for the first time."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Calling it a \"food court\" would be an insult but that's exactly what it is minus the Manchu Wok, Mr. Greek, and sad Subway sandwich artisans. I will definitely be back. Much needed lunch option addition."}
{"text":"Chef's party review- arrive a bit earlier than your call time because lines were massive. I felt like it was over capacity because I was spending eternity lining up for food. I got the prime time pass for 9 food tickets. (Should get 6, it'll be more than enough. 9 was too much imo)   I was able to try a few items and most dishes were yummy and had their unique flavors. Notable dishes were from isshin ramen, dai lo and boemo.  Chef assembly hall does have a trendy and urban atmosphere that everyone can enjoy at their own pace."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience. I rarely write reviews, but the variety of high quality options available here from different master chefs is astonishing."}
{"text":"I decided to convince my friends to join me and try this new food hall during the dinner hours. Rating have been high given the concept is fresh with some of the best restaurants located in one area.  The vibe is good with the lighting, tables, decor and DJ mixing beats.  However, there were a few things that were disappointing despite the few local brands in this hall. Trying to find a table was one of the most difficult things with a larger group. It is much easier with 2 people. The place was packed on a Friday night which is amazing since all the food courts nearby (with the exception of Eaton Centre) were empty. It would be nicer if there was the ability to assign seating or reserve for optimization of tables if people prefer to be seated. We aimlessly walked around for 30 min to find a table before figuring out what to eat.  Second, the prices are similar to the ones found at their restaurants. I realize that the rent and the concept is an expensive venture but having dishes and real cutlery for people who decide to eat in would be a nice touch. It may be a cooler concept for them to deliver to the table although that means additional staff but maybe technology can help coordinate better especially if combined with the seating.  I ordered from Cherry Street BBQ and the turkey was good. However, given we couldn't find a table quick enough and late ordered, all the other choices were sold out. You need to either come early or sacrifice by going elsewhere to eat your takeout. I saw some people at a nearby food court eating their meal the instead of waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Generally, it looks like a food court, but more uppity. Ambience is casual and I like the natural lighting from the giant glass wall looking over the street. If it were raining, it'd be a Lo-Fi music video.   I had the pizza from The Good Son, and my dude had a kale salad because he wasn't hungry like the wolf. I can't really comment on the salad but... I mean, a salad's a salad.   My cappriciosa pizza was 8\" diameter and it was beautiful. The ingredients tasted very fresh and it came out steaming hot. I don't even remember what toppings I had but I'm assuming it's mushrooms because I fell in love with them. Juicy and fresh, it was the best complement to the marinara.   The crust was a little too wide in my opinion. I would've liked more pizza and less crust.   Also, the bottom was quite burnt. :( Too carcinogenic for me!   I'd def recommend this place and get the window seat!! It's pretty romantic to inhale a pizza as you're watching cars pass by."}
{"text":"So many wonderful food options to choose from and conveniently located at the northwest end of the PATH (don't even have to go outside to get here if you work in the Financial District)! My gfs and I came tonight for Ramen Isshin initially, but each ended up getting something different after we walked around the food court to explore the different options. From vegans to carnivores, folks who just want a simple pizza or coffee to foodies who want to sample more gourmet dishes--everyone can find something that satisfies here at the Chef's Hall.   I was so pleasantly surprised to find Hibiscus here and offering a full menu, including vegan ice cream and pastries! I ordered the 42 ingredient salad plus soup of the day (butternut squash) combo tonight for $18 incl tax. My gfs went to Dailo for Peking duck, which they said tasted phenomenal despite being very heavily whitewashed/fusion, and Khao San Road for pad gra. I was disappointed to find that Ramen Isshin only offered 1 of their 4 vegetarian ramens, the red miso. I guess I'm going to have to find another day to trek to their original site near Kensington Market.  Lots of seating available at booths, bar tables, and communal tables. I found the background music too loud though, but could make for a fun Thursday or Friday night.  Main complaint is how $$$ everything is... I feel that the items here are actually more expensive than listed at their main locations. Expect to spend between $15-30 for a full meal per person.  Will be back to try all the other options!"}
{"text":"Interesting experience, a first for me in Toronto  Location: This food hall is located at 111 Richmond Street W, a 5 min walk from the Hudson's Bay and accessible via the PATH.   Food Selection & Variety: When I arrived at 6:00 this evening, the food hall looked fairly empty. I quickly realized that the hall had seating area in the back (up the stairs, towards Reyna). The selection here is plentiful - you've got everything from BBQ, ramen, Thai, Mediterranean, sushi, omakase, seafood, tacos, dessert, coffee....boy my fingers are getting tired from typing out the extensive list.   BF and I opted to eat at Resto Boemo - omg the gnocchi is so sinful that it should be illegal. The mushroom truffle cream half portion was enough to fill me up; it was flavourful, rich and divine. Their gnocchi is 90% ricotta with the remainder being wheat.  Hit me up again *drools* BF isn't normally a fan of gnocchi as he finds it too starchy, but ended up enjoying this.  His meal was the classic double burger with a side of truffle parmesan fries.. you can taste the difference when a patty is cooked on a flat top vs a grill as the juices are retained in the meat...oh my. I'm drooling again at 1:30AM.   Price point: If you're eating here for value, you're doing it wrong. Expect to spend around 15-20 pp without beverages.   Return (Y/N): Yes. I'd like to try the duck confit wings from DaiLo and the omakase from Tachi.  Other things I'd be back for: Bulldog Coffee, Short & Sweet, Hibiscus"}
{"text":"We couldn't decide on a place to eat one night so we went to the one place that has it all under one roof. Although a bit pricey, all of the food comes from reputable restaurants."}
{"text":"Food is tasty but not tasty enough to justify the prices. Atmosphere is pretty unique and it's a nice place to hang out with friends after work. It's like a fancier food court!  Lobster Roll at Bluenose Lobster ($17) Delicious but again, the portion was kind of disappointing.  Caesar at the bar ($14?) Nothing special about this drink. Other places make it better.  Rich in Recession at Short & Sweet ($3.50) This was the one thing I would come back for. They give it to you in a takeout container so its easy to bring it home with you. Not overwhelmingly sweet and it was much needed after this meal.  Gnocchi at Resto Boemo ($23) I ordered the full size because I was still hungry after my lobster roll. It was very creamy and cheesy. I would recommend sharing with someone because eating the whole thing on your own is very rich."}
{"text":"Neat food court!   Went on a Saturday and some of the stations were closed, hence the 4 stars.   Tried a pizza and a popsicle and both were delicious.   There was a Thai station that looked awesome but closed and a Ramen station with one person sitting on her cell phone so I can't say that screamed good, fresh food."}
{"text":"I would describe Assembly Chef's Hall as a bougie cafeteria. I really liked what I saw and what I had! I wasn't very hungry so I ended up getting a small salad from the Vietnamese stall that was there (I don't recall the name of the place ). There is a bar at the very end of the hall and not many places to grab seats (for obvious reasons as the place serves food from some of the top Toronto restauranteurs). Will be coming back with an empty stomach to try out more of the places there!"}
{"text":"Went their once and probably won't return. Food are over price, they don't have open kitchen, so most of the food were either pre-made or already cooked in a huge pot and they serve you like canteen. Their alcoholic drinks are ridiculously expensive and obviously not worth the price."}
{"text":"Great place to go to after work to catch-up with friends or coworkers. The location is convenient as it's easily a less than 10 minute walk from Union Station if you're in the area for a show at the ACC. I would highly recommend the Gnocchi with mushroom truffle cream from Resto Boemo.   I would give this place a 5 star rating but I think the prices for everything is a bit too high for technically a food court. Otherwise, worth going if you're planning to go with a group of people to share food!"}
{"text":"Amazing concept and options, but seriously over priced for the portion size.  I came at 12:30pm for lunch with a colleague, and didn't have to wait too long for lobster rolls at Bluenose Lobster.  They were delicious, but absolutely tiny (more like an appetizer.). Not worth $17!!   I'll go back because it's a great atmosphere and the variety is fun, but will try to find a better bang for my buck that Bluenose."}
{"text":"So is this place a food court? Debatable! Came here for lunch and was overwhelmed by all the choices. They have a bit of every cuisine and food for every palate. I'm really impressed by the selection of vendors available. The layout of the area is open and trendy, with two main dining areas and a elevated vendors area. Atmosphere was bustling and reminded me of new york's Chelsea market. Anyways, I got to try the lobster bisque from bluenose lobster, pulled pork sandwich from cherry street BBQ, and a taco from colibri. They were all delicious and restaurant quality. The lobster bisque was incredibly rich and came with large chunks of lobster meat, along with a little pretzel roll. Pulled pork was tender and flavourful, and they pile your bun with meat. The taco was also authentic and made with a blue corn tortilla. My main concern was the fact that prices were pretty high for all restaurants. Granted, it's situated in a more financial area (I'm just a student) so the target market likely finds the food more affordable.  Also, the vendors take card only at their stall. I would definitely come again to try all the other foods but I better leave it for a treat some other day."}
{"text":"Great concept but considerably overpriced...  There is plenty of options to choose from which is great when eating with large groups. Everyone can fulfill their individual cravings.  This is also a great way for restaurants to showcase their food and get the word out.   We stopped by after work on a Friday, it was a good thing we left early since it can get fairly difficult to find a table.   My friend and I ordered Mexican: two fish tacos (at a staggering 7$ each...) Ceviche, and guac. It was all extremely expensive for Mexican street food (chilequiles were abouta$20...).  The tacos were delicious, the corn tortilla was warm and tasted fresh. The ceviche: underwhelming. The guac was standard.   Our group had a few rounds of drinks and the bartenders were very attentive and great to talk to. They were happy to help with beer suggestions for a friend.  Overall, I will definitely be back:   Atmosphere : top notch, very fun  Food : delicious and great variety  Drinks : two bars and quality drinks Price : splurge outing for sure"}
{"text":"What a hip food court! A little hard to find if you don't know it exists! It's on the 1st floor of Google Toronto building fyi. Also, I had such a hard time deciding what to eat!!! Because you can eat anything you want from BBQ, Thai, Vegetarian, Italian, Ramen, Cupcakes, Coffee, Cocktails etc etc etc! The venue is spacious with an upscale street market vibe that's quite inviting with a fun spunk in the air. There's also a outdoor patio area that serves alcohol but it's always packed with people but if you don't mind sitting indoors, there's lots of different styled seating around that'll accommodate everyone's liking. I had the falafel and parmesan truffle fries and they were SO GOOD. Everyone who works there is super friendly/professional as well. Can't wait to go back and try other dishes from different vendors."}
{"text":"This place is so trendy and awesome. Amazing selection of high quality and delicious food. You've got to eat the brisket from Cherry Street. Will be back her often."}
{"text":"We got the 35 dollar ticket for 5 dish and 1 drink. It was so gooooood!!! The place has a very hippy atmosphere and trendy."}
{"text":"I'm here for the soft opening and gave a five star rating based on my first impression, the fact that this place is very cool and genuinely unique in Toronto - I have great expectations.   Seven of the Eighteen restaurants are open today with the rest coming online in the next couple of weeks.   Started at Colibri.  Hand pressed tortillas fresh cooked in front you on a funky spinning grill. The Baja Fish Taco is a classic and delicious.   The Beef Alambre is special.   Couldn't leave it at that so I stopped at Reyna for Jamon & Manchego on a buttery croissant. It was perfect and impossible to eat just one.   I'm pumped to come back for Fried Chicken, Pizza, Ramen, Coffee, Dessert and the Bar.... and everything else.   Consider Assembly a destination. I do."}
{"text":"Hipster as hell, loud, mazelike, and extremely pricey. If it wasn't for the fact I was having a meeting here I probably wouldn't have come. The exorbitant prices for the portion sizes are bewildering, and the no-cash system was a surprise. I was given a dirty look when I expressed surprise cash wasn't accepted. Sorry for not being classy enough, wow!"}
{"text":"New favourite spot for lunch in the financial district!  It's PATH accessible and has TONs and TONs of options ranging from well-known restaurants to refreshing new options.  I came here mid- January and the word has definitely spread and the hype is very real. For popular stalls (ie. the cherry street BBQ) be prepared for a long line if you come during peak lunch hour.   I tried the 42 ingredient salad from Hibiscus and it was really good and surprising filling. Like other reviewers have said, this is definitely not a place for cheap eats. Expect to pay $12-20 for a meal.  Pro tip: download the Assembly Chef's Hall for a free coffee (you get to choose from 3 places) for a value up to $5. I tried Nutmilk and got a coffee with their nut milk blend and it was very interesting....definitely very nutty. An excellent choice for vegans as well as people who are into nut milks. Next time, I really want to check out Tokyo Smoke.  FYI, it's open until 7pm so you can also come here for dinner after work!"}
{"text":"Hipster food court  But really though, you're either a professional getting some food or you're a guy in jeans and a beard chilling.  The atmosphere is nice enough that I would go back. The sheer range of foods is worth it and I plan on trying each vendor eventually. Individual menus are kind of small and prices are pretty akin to what you would pay at an actual restaurant so it's not the cheapest."}
{"text":"Assembly chef's hall is what I would call a trendy/high end food court. A whole bunch of delicious restaurants come together under one roof with a bar! The options are awesome, from fried chicken, to ramen, to burgers, to tacos, to coffee and cupcakes. There's definitely something for everything!  The atmosphere is great, lots of young people, suits, and people who just wanna let loose a little after work. It can get pretty busy and finding a table to sit at can be quite a battle. My friend and I went early to try to find a table for 6 people, we first stood around at a pillar with a ledge for the first 15-20 minutes, grabbed a 2 person table as soon as it became available while still keeping an eye out on any table that shows signs of emptying out soon, swooped into a 4 person table when those guys left for a larger table, and finally after an hour, we managed to conquer the big 6 person table! Woohoo!   The downside is that it's a little pricey. The cost of food is probably less if you go to the original locations, and drinks are pretty expensive. A steam whistle is $10, a pitcher of margarita is $44 (which serves about... 5 medium glasses because almost the whole pitcher is ice). But that's what you pay for for the diverse options and the atmosphere I guess. The other downside is that the food stalls closes pretty early, on the website some of them say that they close at 10, 11pm depending on which stall, but majority of them close around 9-9:30pm. After that, the place dies down quite a bit.  Regardless we all really enjoyed ourselves and it's a good play to hang out after a long day of work!"}
{"text":"This place is an overpriced hipster cafeteria.  All don't take cash.  All their venues ask for a tip.  Did I forget something? There is no servers here.  No one comes to my table.  Why tip option?  And who gets the tip?  Anyways everything is insanely overpriced.  It won't survive.  It's very loud also. To pay average 30 bucks for a lunch meal that you sit in a picnic bench with. No thanks"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for dinner Friday evening with the kids.  Loved the variety of food you could choose from. They have everything from sushi, to fried chicken, to pasta, to dessert. Previous reviews complained about prices being high, but for the most part, we found them to be pretty fair. For sure you'll Be paying higher than regular food court prices, but this is no ordinary food court! Truffle fried rice at dailo was delicious, could take or leave the duck wings.  Very disappointed that little Khao had run out their Khao soi by 6pm on a Friday night because that was actually the reason we decided to come here.   The surprise star meal we had was from Love Chix. We got 3 pieces of chicken, fries, and gravy, $20. In my rush to order, I didn't notice that they sauces the chicken (even said it on the menu). I went to order another order because it was too spicy for my kids, but they told me not to worry about it, and made me another order, no questions asked!  I really appreciate this gesture, and even though I insisted, they wouldn't let me pay for it. And they gave candy to my kids, lol.   Small gesture, but really made my day and the kids loved it."}
{"text":"I came for their monthly event - cinco de mayo. It was $35 including one drink and 5 tapas with Mexican themed. Overall the food was just okay, there was nothing special and too pricey for the amount that was given. Although it was more like \"tasting\", it seems like it should be around $20-$25 only because they're literally bite size pieces!"}
{"text":"If you haven't gone to Assembly Chef Hall, go! I'm definitely coming back to try more. The place itself is very trendy, spacious and classy (but $$$) with a casual ambiance. *Cash option is not available*   Most vendors show a display of the items they offer and it was very hard to choose between all of them. Everything looked delicious. There is a lot of variety and if you don't know what to eat, love trying new things or you have a group of friends, this is the place to go. (Note: If you download the Assembly Chef's Hall App, you get a free drink coupon ! It says free coffee but some places allow you to order any drink as long as it is within $5 but they also allow you to pay the difference). I got a quality matcha latte from Tokyo Smoke.  I was quite disappointed when I found out that Bluenose Lobster was out of stock on some of their items... but I found Reyna instead where a very nice lady explained the menu to me and recommended the daily special ($16.99) that featured their top three menu items: -Lamb Shank Baklava- kataifi, lamb shank, saffron & burnt honey aioli  This was amazingly delicious and the shank melted in my mouth. The honey aioli accented it perfectly. This was my favorite out of the three and I would probably get this on its own again. -Lebanese Tacos- housemade flatbreads, reyna-spiced chicken (they allowed me to sub it with their brisket instead- I think I should've stuck with the chicken though because it was a bit dry without the sauce that the chicken would have came with), garlic mayo, lebanese pickles, cherry tomato salsa, crispy onions -The Reyna Salad was loaded with ingredients: beet, cucumber, avocado, fennel, radish, tomato, quinoa, purple kale, fried chickpeas, crispy shallot, serrano tahini dressing. Very refreshing, colorful and a lot of flavors. I only wished for more chickpeas. Overall, each item was a smaller portion of their original but it was a great way to try their different dishes.  Side note: A lot of my friends highly recommend the burger from Boemo."}
{"text":"It's like a crazy awesome collection of all your favorite foods in one place! Very trendy vibes with a seat yourself type environment. Like an upscale food court is how I think I would best describe it!  We had a friend from out of town (like way out) visiting and with no ideas what she likes to eat, we figured why not visit a bunch of restaurants offering their best dishes all in one place? Turned out to be a fantastic choice!  We got the brussel sprouts from the fried chicken location. We weren't feeling for fried chicken, but those brussel sprouts were so good!! I could eat them all day! Lightly seasoned with parmesan and fried. Mmmm  I got a ramen from the cute looking ramen shop and they had fresh ginger ale. I am not one known to resist fresh Ginger drinks so obviously I was sold. It was so delicious!!! Fresh ginger juice, lime and lemon juice, some Maple syrup, and soda. So fresh, so good! I could drink this all day! The ramen was also fantastic. Great noodle texture and nice broth, but just slightly too salty.  Saving best for last, we got the Pigs Finders Frites which are truffle parmesan fries. Witty name and delicious! We got their famous creamy mushroom truffle gnocchi. If you're there, you gotta try it!! Delicious!!!! Gnocchi were very nicely made. Very light. Not as fluffy as I've tried at other Italian places but definitely amazing anyway!   The staff are all incredible, energetic people and they are just so excited by their food! It's definitely a bit pricier, but you're getting some quality food. Where else can I have vegan desserts, fried Brussel sprouts, ramen, and Italian gnocchi in one sitting??  Bring a friend and have a great time!"}
{"text":"Places such as Assembly Chef's Hall is what makes Toronto a great Foodie City. In the heart of downtown, you have a massive food court with over 15 restaurant options. There's a vibe here, that I absolutely love. There are 2 beautiful bar spaces, tons of seating on either side and the options are endless. The best part is you can get here underground which I love!   I have tried The Good Son, Bulldog Coffee, Love chix & Nutbar. The pizza at Good son was very good, I got the Margarita and the dough was tasty - the sauce was also very flavorful.   Moving on to Bulldog Coffee... I was greeted by a friendly barista who puts in so much love while making specialty coffees. I ordered the Rainbow Latte and it tasted great and looks really cool. I'd come back here just because they were so sweet and really put in alot of effort into making sure every cup of coffee is perfect.   Nutbar was good, I ordered an Iced Americano. Service was great!   My absolute favorite is Love Chix - One of the best fried chicken sandwiches I've ever tasted. The bun is soft, the fried chicken is cripsy and beyond flavorful - has a mix of sweet and spicy, there's a bit of a glaze which I love.   Overall, I love this place and think it's a great concept.   Keep Eating,   Angela"}
{"text":"Come for the vibe, stay to try out the different food stalls. It's a great place to grab a meal between work, catch up with friends, and caters to friend groups with a variety of dietary preferences and restrictions. It's really just a food court, but it's way nicer and cooler than your average one.   It's behind the Sheraton, accessible by the PATH, and is situated next to the lobby of the Google office.   Wasn't too busy on a Saturday afternoon (after 1pm).   We tried: Bulldog Coffee: the rainbow latte (normal latte, but they add food coloring into the foamed milk so it creates a pretty pattern), and the marshmallow latte (marshmallows in a martini glass, with steamed milk, espresso, and toasted with a blowtorch). The barista is a super cool guy to talk to, and he was very welcoming and let us watch him make our drinks.   Hibiscus: 33 ingredient salad was a little cold, but refreshing, light, and reasonably priced. The crepes were beautiful and tasty, but the same as the way they serve it at their place in Kensington.   We also tried the khao soi from Little Khao, which was fairly standard. There are bussers who clean the tables and pick up your dishes after you're done, but you don't feel rushed to leave so it's nice to get a few drinks after your meal to catch up with friends. Cool concept, great food, and great vibe!"}
{"text":"Such a great variety at Assembly Chef's Hall! From Japanese food to Mexican, there is an option for everyone. Tokyo Smoke serves great drinks like lattes. Tachi offers quality stand up sushi. Shari has unique barachirashi that is authentic like in Japan! Ramen Isshin is a popular choice with often queues.  The Food Hall has different shops similar to a food court with shared seating between restaurants. Great ambiance as well - for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Great food, great space, really well-executed. As food halls go, it's the best collection you'll find in town. Like a gathering of the best food trucks, but a permanent indoor fixture. Reminds me of the food court under the Louvre - no chains and high quality - but more casual, more Toronto, more global. Will be a regular stop."}
{"text":"Great place if you've got a group of people who all want different things. Or if you're visiting and want to try a bit from some of the top/most popular restaurants in the city. Or if you're just super undecided on what you want to eat.  So many options! There's bbq, tacos, pizza, Thai food, Chinese food, sushi, etc. There's also a bar, a coffee bar, and a couple sweet/dessert shops.  I got the Rainbow Latte from Bulldog Coffee. Super instagram-able but also just a solid latte.  Also got the Capricciosa pizza from The Good Son Pizza. Great dough, a bit salty.  Pricing is a teeny bit pricey but understandable considering you're also paying for the variety of options and seating area.  Solid food hall. Personally I like the layout better than Chicago's Revival Hall. I like that the food stalls are separated from the seating area and there's way more seating."}
{"text":"Great place, great music and ambiance.  But it is very highly priced with too few tables, meaning you often have to wait to sit."}
{"text":"I got here fairly early on a Tuesday (11:15 maybe?), and it wasn't crowded at all, I actually had enough time to casually browse and have several conversations with different booths, which was really helpful because I couldn't decide what to eat. I settled on the Baja fish tacos and I'm so glad I did. The person behind the counter suggested I go with the giant taco (essentially, two tacos), if I was looking for a full meal. It was a lot of food! I'd recommend just getting one unless you're starving. This was THE BEST FISH TACO I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. It wasn't an intense overwhelming taste. It was the kind of thing where a few bites in, I turned to my friend and said hey, I think this is the best fish taco I've ever had and he agreed. What's great about this \"food court\" is that there are a lot of options. The food is of high quality and prepared with a lot of care, unlike your traditional food courts. Prices are a little higher, so be prepared, but the service, cleanliness and of course, the food, make it more than worthwhile."}
{"text":"This is a fun, eclectic and tasty collection of eateries that will delight your tastebuds, but not your inner frugal foodie. There's an array to choose from and ample space to claim your own. We enjoyed Resto Boemo with their yummy frites and the Boho Truffle Gnocchi was rich and delicious. Don't share, get your own... and insist your friend do the same There's a full bar... but don't expect anyone to pour your wine. It's cafeteria style seating. You've got to order your food and drinks and bring it to your table."}
{"text":"Gourmet food court is one way to describe Assembly Chef's Hall but it's more than that. Several of Toronto's popular restaurants (and chefs) are represented here, with smaller versions of their main locations. These include Reyna (Bar Reyna), DaiLo, Ramen Isshin, The Good Son, Little Khao (Khao San Road), Cherry Street Bar-B-Que, and more.  There are enough food choices to satisfy any palette, whether it's a healthy salad, pizza, Asian, BBQ, seafood, dessert, coffee, alcohol, or so much more. In fact, it took about 20 minutes for my companions and me to decide what we wanted to try. We ended up with a warm lobster roll from Bluenose Lobster, ribs and brisket from Cherry Street Bar-B-Que, and parm fries and gnocchi from Resto Boemo.  The food was pretty good (see individual reviews) but, depending on what time you arrive, seating could be an issue, despite the whole place being quite spacious. I understand there will also be outdoor seating over the summer. We arrived shortly after 6:00pm, in the middle of the after-office crowd and it was very busy. It took a bit of walking around and waiting to find a table (that we shared).  The ambiance was kinda trendy warehouse-chic, with dimmer lighting in the seating and bar areas. There's a live DJ playing music that gave the place a little bit of a club vibe.  I like this place. Even with friends willing to share, there were too many choices for just one visit. I'll be back. Who's joining me?"}
{"text":"It is an upscale food court. I assume techies in the building and office goers nearby patronize it. You can expect to spend nearly $20 for a lunch or dinner, and that's  just one helping, sometimes small. The food is not that outstanding. The Ice-cream flavours were interesting. Enjoyed those."}
{"text":"Amazing, open concept space. I joked and called it a glamorized food court, but it offers so much more. All the vendors looked great! Had a green curry and a ramen, amazing food - bit on the pricier side. There are lots of seats and standing tables, the patio is also now open. Great energy, and sometimes vendors would even come around with free samples. Would definitely recommend and return."}
{"text":"YES, this place is so cool. It's like a food court, but with amazing local restaurants offering a limited menu. I took 4 friends here who were visiting from out of town and it was perfect! We cold try so many local places, and everyone could get what they wanted. We went at noon on a Saturday and there was plenty of seating.   This is what the group had:   Bulldog Coffee: Rainbow Latte The Good Son: Margherita Pizza Calbri: Cod Ceviche, Fish taco, Beef Taco Resto Boemo: Pig Finder Fries, Canuck on Bread Ramen Isshin - Veggie Miso Ramen  My friend LOVED the Canuck on Bread from Resto Boemo -- it was a sandwich with mac'n' cheese and peameal bacon. He said it \"changed his life\".  The Good Son pizza was delicious. Same with the Tacos  I would pass on the ceviche at Calbri, I didn't come close to finishing it-- it was really plain and felt like it was missing something. The fish itself was kind of chewy and lackluster (it was a whitefish I forget what kind -- cod?)  There's a bar so you can get a drink with your meal if you want  Anyway, super cool place to go and try lots of different foods. Would be awesome for a date especially if you don't know what the person likes to eat because you can pick anything haha. Also great place to take visitors for a taste of the Toronto food scene! Can't wait till their patio opens"}
{"text":"Basically a premium, hip food court for the aspiring or wannabe hipsters.   Neat food options, definitely a welcome change from the drab and repetitive establishments that are repeated at all the other neighbouring food courts.   However, consider this to be a splurgy food court that you'd come to on occasion for a treat and definitely not on a regular basis unless you're rolling in the dough. You'll most likely be looking at a $20 lunch here. On the bright side, most establishments are delivering a similar quality to what you'd get at their original, full-size locations. I do however find the portions to be small, especially considering the price."}
{"text":"This is such a great lunch spot for the 9-to-5ers. Always an event going on with lots of variety to stave off lunch routine boredom. Favourite spot to check out: Shari. Cannot go wrong with the large bara-chirashi-zushi, which is a little pricey at just under $20, but so is everything else downtown. Green tea and salad are also delish must-try add-ons."}
{"text":"There are many good restaurant pop up brands. It was great. But price is high. It's like expensive food court. It was good experience for me, but I'd not go back. Maybe, next year?"}
{"text":"My co-worker told me this place was really good and had went on about her chicken sandwich so I had to go...  My friend and I arrived and walked around and promptly left.  The place is pretentious, super loud, crowded and crazy expensive (seriously, $20 minimum for a weekday lunch at a food court?!).  We both felt like we had walked into some bizarre day time nightclub.  Do yourself a favour and skip it!"}
{"text":"Cutest food court ever!!! I love the variety of food they have and every restaurant/food stand was very appealing making it harder to choose from.   My friends and I decided to try a couple things, the tacos, a pizza, gnocchi and truffle fries!   Tacos - from colibrí, going to be honest the shell was a little weird, chewy and dry  - different from one's I usually eat from other taco restaurants. Kind of disappointing, we tried the fish ones  Pizza - from The Good Son, we had the margarita pizza. Absolutely delicious, the curst wasn't too thick and had the right amount of topping not too much tomato sauce - recommended  Gnocchi and Truffle Fries - from Resto Boemo -- THE BEST!!! The only reason I would come back. The gnocchi was creamy and melts in your mouth. The truffle fries were seasoned very well, not salty but had enough flavour. Absolutely would recommend to try. The employees of the restaurant were very nice as well.   Overall the food court is absolutely beautiful and I would highly recommend coming here if you want to have a food adventure.   Can't wait to come back and see the patio!"}
{"text":"I'd say this is the best place ever in downtown if you want to grab lunch or dinner along with your friends as they got many options to choose from and having a chef based concept - the dishes here are highly recommended and fun to sit and eat with. Also coffee lovers do have their set of coffee bars.. been many times already and will go back again and again!"}
{"text":"Been here several times already and this high end food court never disappoints. All the vendors in this place are all well know restaurants around the downtown Toronto area. Most stalls have an independent store front somewhere in downtown area.   This place is great for people working nearby and coming here for after work drinks or even catching a game with friends. There is a lots of choice in food here so there is definitely no shortage. The only downfall is that this place gets packed real quick. After work and Fridays are pretty busy and the seating is quite limited.   The food from most of the stalls are all quite tasty however it's expensive. It's good to come here once in awhile to grab food and drinks but it can add up real fast as most items are $9 - $17 for a meal. Unless you can put all expenses on the company card then your fine and this won't apply to you.   The only food item that I find is the best bang for your buck in this place is ordering the oven baked pizza. You can get a large pizza for around $14 and its quite filling if you include a beer. Overall, the other food is good as well but I find it may not fill you up if you have a big appetite but the pizza can definitely do the job ;)"}
{"text":"Awesome food hall located in the Google building downtown Toronto. If you wanna spend at least 20 bucks on a relatively small dish - you have found the spot.  The food is delish but the price is shocking. I loved the vibe here, everyone is super friendly and there's tons of events happening always.  Would go back but it's important to pre-eat."}
{"text":"This is literally the only place I ever want to eat now. All the vendors are so varied, delicious, and creative. If you're a foodie and have a taste for the finer yums in life, then this is the place for you. They have monthly events where you can sample 6+ vendors for $35-40 if you want a good intro to this place. Otherwise, please take my advice and order the following:  BAR REYNA - Lamb Baklava - a delicious spin on this yummy dessert. Unreal. (side note: the Yorkville Bar Reyna location has buck a shuck oysters on Tuesday nights and a 7 items for $7 menu during their 4:00-7:00pm happy hour, and a beautiful patio!).  LOVE CHIX - Fried Chicken & Crispy Brussels Sprouts. This is my favorite in the whole assembly hall. Holy #$@% is it good.  BLUENOSE LOBSTER - Rouleau de Homard (Warm Lobster Roll). I'm intolerant to gluten, but I have and I will constipate myself for this one.  (Sidenote: there are a few gluten free vendors in the hall, including Hibiscus.)   COLIBRI - Baja Style Fish (taco). This is my favorite of their tacos. I'm a bit of a taco connoisseur so I will say, look it's not *the best* fish taco I've ever had *but* it's pretty frickin' good.   It's all wonderful though. Fool proof menus. Not cheap, but solid value."}
{"text":"This is a really good spot for lunch! I love that there is a live DJ (not sure if it was just the day I went) but it was pretty live. There were a lot of great options and it's a great place to go with a group of colleagues.   Just a warning, it gets packed at lunch, I would recommend going a bit earlier. I arrived around 11:30am for lunch and there was already a long line for Ramen Isshin. It is more of a high end food court though, lunch was about $20 with tax with a meal and drink."}
{"text":"Its just like a European football! Variety of vendors inside. And order food cafeteria style.  The atmosphere and decor are spot on amazing!  (Has outdoor patio seating as well) The prices feel the same as restaurant and are around 20$. I tried the Chimac chicken and tacos. Loved both of them.  Wish it was slightly cheaper. But do love the atmosphere and location."}
{"text":"Ordered a takeout. The pizza was still hot as I got it, but the crust was soggy and soft(don't know whether it's due to the box). The taste of sauce was ok."}
{"text":"I love the idea of this place. Great for when you and your food partner cant agree on what to eat. Something for everyone. Sweets, coffee, sushi, pizza, ramen, bbq.  Even just walking through to look at all the options is fun. Like an upscale food court. And get a latte. They do fun things with colours for the latte art.  I got the ramen last time and it was really good. (Sansotei is still number one. The black garlic one is out of this world)  We also had a pizza from the good son. Really nice thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"A large selection of food but it's really overpriced. I get that it's in the financial district but it's a food court... c'mon!"}
{"text":"Copying the Time Out concept globally, Assembly Chef's Hall finally got added to the Toronto food scene in a highly anticipated manner.  The place has been a huge success thus far, and the lineup of restaurants is very impressive.  From a space perspective, the location is great, especially in terms of walkability. The interior is just the right amount of chic, yet maintaining minimal industrial charm. You have various seating at three ends of the space with high tops, low tops, picnic benches, and bar stool style. If you haven't found a space yet to sit down, there's a good chance you will in the next 5 minutes, but you'll need to take a friend to scope out finding a seat while you order. Oh and yes, they have bars.   The food vendors are excellent with spaces from the chefs of ShouShin, Khao San Road, Dailo, the Good Son, and so on.  Price wise, this place is expensive because food portions are small and on top of that, you need at least a couple of things to fill you up. However, every similar concept in any part of the world is basically the same. So you have to look at it from a convenience and novelty perspective to really feel like you're not over paying.  At the end of the day, I think it's worth while popping in to every once in a while, but I'd rather spend $30-$60 in a restaurant with service, than a food court. For the busy person who likes quality food, and is willing to spend the money, this makes sense at lunch. For the average person however, eating here daily would be a stretch."}
{"text":"Bustling joint with a plethora of options and ample seating. The food is served quickly so you can really eat and get out in 20 min if that's what you want. Otherwise it feels like a nice place to catch up with a friend as well"}
{"text":"the space is clean, beautiful and convenient. the food selection is amazing. if you can't find something good to eat here, your taste buds are most likely busted.   and it's a fun place to go. you can see high quality food being prepared by very capable (sometimes famous) chefs.   of course, there's always a catch. like many have said, it's pretty pricey. at $30-40 a person you start to feel like you shouldn't be lining up to get your own food or clearing your dishes.   it's a tradeoff i suppose. it's relaxed place. you can spend all day here with a laptop and a coffee if you like. you couldn't do that in at fancy restaurant. in any case, however, buyer beware.   assembly chef's hall is better than many food halls in nyc imho. it capably fills in a missing niche in toronto's food scene."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends on a weekday evening, and was very happy with the high-end food court experience. No reservation required, but it also means that finding  seating for a group of 6 friends might take a while. There are both small single tables for two people as well as large bench style cafeteria seating available for larger groups. Restaurants from all different places, Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Lebanese, gourmet cakes, seafood, and bars are all available. Repeat visit is definitely needed since one cannot possibly try all the great food stalls here in one seating!   Each restaurant has their own staff, but there's also dedicated staff to oversee everything at Assembly Chef's Hall. The waitors are all very efficient at taking away any empty dishes. While we were there one elderly customer and an unfortunate fall on the staircase. The restaurant staff were quick to come to assist her and offered another bowl of ramen to replace the one that was dropped.   One side note about my experience here, there are small candles in shot glasses on the tables here, and while it creates a nice atmosphere, be aware of where your things are on the table if you have a large group of people and everyone's things get piled on the table. I had an unfortunate accident with my jacket being burned. Just a tale of caution for all those who plan to come in large groups!"}
{"text":"This place is great in the sense that there is an option for everyone, but I find that consistency in the quality is an issue. I went to Goodson twice, on two separate occasions, and the first time the pizza was great, and the second time the cheese was cold and lumpy. I have also had the ramen, which was not good at all - very salty. Lastly, I have had the fried chicken sandwich, which I thought was delicious."}
{"text":"Assembly Chef's Hall is a not a food court, but a Centralized location offers great food from Toronto's great chefs. You don't need to have long wait or pay a lot in their regular restaurants and allow you to have some of the best dishes on their menu.   The best way to experience ACH is to call a group of friends and share the dishes together. Most of the seatings are communion style and able to fit big groups.   My Yelp friends shared a few dishes together:  Bara Chirashi from Shari - sushi rice is prepared perfectly and the seafood is very fresh.   pad gra prao from Little Khao - the meat is flavourful and love the spices they used.   Spicy Sopressata Pizza from Good Son - the pizza is made to order.   They are all nicely done and taste very delicious. I have to admit the price point is higher than regular \"food court\", but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Much reviewed and with good reason, picture a mall food court that is made up of your favourite restaurants. A casual setting, quick food but high quality."}
{"text":"I had a lobster roll.  I loved it.  My husband had a pizza which was also very good. We both had the iced tea.  This was light and refreshing.  The only reason I took a star away is because it was so noisy, we couldn't hear each other well enough to talk."}
{"text":"this place one of my most important work-lunch time criteria: it was entirely accessible underground thru the PATH from my office at Bay and Front.  I left at what I thought was an early time to beat the lunch crowd (11:20am) but by the time i reached the hall line ups were already forming at certain kiosks.  I tried the beef khao soi from Little Khao. Very quick service. Amazing flavors and a huge portion size. I still prefer chicken w/ khao soi but was fun to try regardless.  It had gotten SUPER packed by the time I was walking out. The dining area might be spacious but the actual food-getting-zone was a bit cramped. Go early."}
{"text":"With Torvehallerne in Copenhagen and Revival Food Hall in Chicago being my 2 top favourite food halls in the world (so far), I was really hoping Toronto Assembly Chef's call could live up to the hype.  After my first quick visit, I think it hit it great in some aspects and ... unfortunately missed in one key attribute.  Overall, this is a great quick & casual spot ESPECIALLY in the after hours.  I've only come here on a Saturday which is much more reasonable than the weekday lunch where you have all the office workers just piling in and sounds more painful than a Gardiner trip at 8 am.   What makes a great food hall... approachable quality food, large variety of flavours and cuisines, chef driven instead of corporate driven, fun vibe and clean space, and affordable (not necessarily cheap) options.  Torvehallerne and Revival fulfilled both perfectly ... Assembly almost does.    Assembly has approachable quality food with a vast offering from everything from vegetarian to Japanese ramen to Thai curries to thin crust pizza to smoked BBQ to highly frosted topped cupcake.  This is a solid offering of what a food hall can do.  I also love how Assembly has each  space be driven by a well established Toronto Chef... you can trace most of these places to a well regarded restaurant.  You have Little Dailo from Chef Nick Liu of famed Dailo, Ramen Isshin from the well regarded Kingyo Izakaya... each spot goes back to a great spot.  As for the space, this is great.  You have a fair amount of seating in a modern space and it's clean!! You have no idea how many food halls around the world are just dirty ... where you dread sitting down.  This is spotless guys!    So the last requirement... affordability.  Oh Assembly... I hope this doesn't hamper your repeating success.  In Revival and Torvehallerne, I could have a wonderful 3 part meal from Noma stages or their former sous chef for only C$15 and be so sated.  After reading the current reviews of the Assembly 1s or 3s stars... it's value and price that's the sticking point.  C$20 for a snack sized meal or 3 pieces of tiny chicken that is supposed to be an entree?  Oh no... that doesn't work well for most of Toronto.  I get it that the rent is probably high in Google's first floor and maybe this is just a glorified cafe just for the highly paid.  If you want to bring back people over and over again... the value needs to be there. It doesn't have to be cheap... but people can't walk away hungry after a $20 lunch.  I really want a good food hall to stay in Toronto so please rethink this!  Aside from the prices and value, I think there is a lot of potential great options here.  From my short stop here, I'm going to call out 3 in particular that were wonderful ... and one not so great.  Bulldog Coffee - You want a passionate and genuinely friendly barista who has charisma and a good cup for you... come here.  Solid flat whites.   Short & Sweet - Loved the owner who knows how to strike up a fun conversation, bring on the click bait 'gram' shots, and passionate about his baking... come here.  Definitely coming back to try a cupcake or bar Good Son - One of the other friendly spots that called to us as we walked around... they were clearly enjoying themselves and proud of what they can create.    Colibri - I was hoping to stop here for a taco since my last great taco was in San Diego.  Toronto taco scene is ... ahem anyhow.  They ran out of mas (the corn needed to make taco shell... yeah, basic ingredient).  With the prices sitting at $7+ (Im hoping this is NOT per taco but I think it is), this seemed to be a bit disorganized and hitting higher than what a good taco should be.  Even in San Diego, the upscale spots were doing $15 for 3 Baja Fish tacos.  I'll give Assembly the benefit of a doubt and come back to see if my optimism is not misplaced.  4 stars for a repeat and with hopes it stays that way or get better.  Hopefully my update will bring this place up a star."}
{"text":"When people ask me, I like to describe Assembly as a \"high end food court\"   I've been here a handful of times and really enjoying walking around and checking out the different offerings at each stall.   Being walking distance from the financial district, it is quite busy during weekday lunch hours.   It leans on the pricy side for a casual lunch but it's definitely a treat compared to the usual spots in the Toronto underground path.   The concept is great (especially for groups) because there is probably something for everyone."}
{"text":"Reminds me of a smaller version of New York's Chelsea market. Much smaller version but has lots of great variety and everything I've gotten there has been so yummy. Definitely on the pricier side but you're getting what you pay for. Great concept of tons of different cuisines combined with a vibrant atmosphere. Major plus that it's connected to the path and right in the financial district! Little Khao, the baked goods stall, and tacos (beside the smoked bbq place) have been my fave !"}
{"text":"Great place to go when you can't make a decision on what to eat!  I like how it's like a cafeteria for adults and the food is across many different varieties!  I had the lobster bisque from Blue nose lobster and the marshmallow latte from the bulldog cafe. The price is a bit more than it would be of you were to visit their parent restaurant but worth the colocation."}
{"text":"Love this place. The concept, the vendors, the atmospheres, everything is fantastic.   Have had food from Tachi, Reyna, Ramen Isshin, Cherry St bbq, and Love Chix.  Food from all these places was great. Yesterday we went for drinks and food at assembly and had a fantastic time. I sincerely hope this concept flourishes and that assembly sticks around for a while."}
{"text":"A high-end food court for hipsters, techies, and 30-40 somethings, Assembly Chef's Hall is tucked right behind the Sheraton hotel on Richmond and York St. There's some really great finds in here but it's definitely on the pricier side for lunch/dinner. Now, the following is a list that was pulled directly from the Chef's webpage, but I've starred those that I've personally tried and can recommend:  1. Tokyo Smoke Coffee for the sophisticated smoker; those who embrace high design and alternative states of mind.  2. Reyna Mediterranean shareplates and mezze, from charcuterie to pintxos and everything in between.  3. Hibiscus Fine gluten-free, organic, vegan and vegetarian cuisine from the heart of Kensington Market.  4. Dailo New Asian Cuisine, featuring predominantly Chinese fare with a French tradition.  5. Ramen Isshin Bringing authentic Ramen to the heart of Toronto, offering a wide variety of bowls that are unique in flavours, textures and taste.  6. The Good Son Pizza Hand-tossed, made-to-order pizza with the finest variety of toppings.  7. Bulldog Coffee Taking the espresso experience to the next level. Featuring a unique blend created with the finest and most flavourful beans from Africa and Central and South America.  8. Tachi Omakase, elevating one's appreciation of sushi beyond the palate to encompass the entire sensory experience.  9. Little Khao Toronto's favourite Bangkok and central-Thai style street food, made with the freshest Thai ingredients. A Khao San Road joint.  10. Cherry Street Bar-B-Que *** Worth it! Delicious and saves you the hike out to the beaches! The guys here are super nice. Pit-smoked barbecue, drawing on a variety of regional styles and flavours.  11. Mira Mira Health-conscious fare with purposeful, high impact ingredients - without the sacrifice of bold flavours.  12. Resto Boemo \"Boemo\" meaning bohemian or free spirit, serves up contemporary Canadian comfort foods.  13. Shari Chirashi, consistent with Chef Jackie Lin's passion for excellence and authenticity and his desire to share traditional? Japanese fare and food culture with his customers.  14. Nutbar Superfood snack cafe.  15. Love Chix The neighbourhood go-to favourite for crispy fried chicken with a touch of Canadian infused flavours.  16. Colibrí *** OMG-higher end than Seven Lives in Kensington, more of a treat! But Seven Lives is still better value. 2 premium tacos for $14 and the tortilla is handmade (impressive!) Authentic, hand-pressed tortillas with regionally-inspired fillings and a variety of fresh, daily salsas.  17. Bluenose Lobster Toronto's freshest, Nova Scotia lobster prepared daily; from bisque and rolls to full lobster thermidor.  18. Short & Sweet Handcrafted using only the finest ingredients including pure vanilla, Belgian chocolate, fresh berries and mouthwatering citrus. Topped with sweet buttercream, colourful sprinkles and belgian chocolate shavings, Short & Sweet provides a perfectly delicious take on your favourite homemade classics.  Mon - Wed 7 am - 10 pm  Thurs - Fri 7 am - 10 pm  Sat 10 am - 10 pm  Sun Coming soon!   (dated Apr 14, 2018)  Credit for restaurant descriptions and hours goes to: https://www.assemblychefshall.com/menus/  Now back to my review... Most of the meals range from 12-15+ dollars and there is an expectation to tip, which is unlike other food courts. With tax, it's not a cheap lunch. Expect to pay about $20 and more.  Yes, the quality is there in the meals and there's definitely a variety to choose from but as for a downtown quick meal, there are better value spots. There's all-you-can-drink free water at the bar; self-serve.  Although the atmosphere is a bit noisy (loud top 40 music), it's great for groups of 4-10 (or even more!) and for indecisive hungry folks like me. Good for meet-ups with your office friends and networking events.  Look for the electric red \"A\" sign at 111 Richmond Street and the entrance with the \"Google\" sign. It's almost like the hidden cave of treasures in Aladdin; prepare to be amazed."}
{"text":"This is why Toronto is foodie city heaven. Concept is great you have a couple of bars, high chairs and over 8 different restaurants to choose from. You can choose from sushi, Italian food, smoked bbq, fried chicken, street Thai style entrees, lobster, tacos, charcuterie, matcha coffee plenty more.  Love Chix had some great fried chicken. You get about 6 large wing pieces smothered in a sweet Thai like sauce. Lightly breaded and dipped in their house made sauce was delicious. Pair it with their number 1 side the Brussels sprouts with Parmesan cheese. Khai San Road has some great minced Thai flavored beef over rice. You get a fairly large portion for the price. The best place had to be Restored Boemo. We had the truffle gnocchi, truffle Parmesan fries and poutine fries. Everything was rich in flavor and well worth it. Def a must try.   Highly recommend visiting this hall if you are in the area. They have everything for everyone. Plenty of seating and high hairs. Place is wishing walking distance in the financial district"}
{"text":"Little expensive, and not much food in your plate, don't expect too much.Food was ok, just like regular food court  down eaton centre."}
{"text":"Love Assembly Chef's Hall Concept of having some of the best restaurants in TO to open up a stall in a \"food court\" like setting.   The offerings are quite versatile and with a good selection of dish that represent the individual business.   Great for groups and even individuals.   We tried the Spicy Sopressata Pizza from The Good Son ($18), Bara Chirashi from Shari ($19.50) and Pad Gra Prao from Little Khao ($17). They were all really tasty and really similar to what one would get in the perspective restaurants.  One might argue that they are more pricier from regular food court. But moving forward the price might be adjusted based on the market situation since they just opened for business last week.  Music was pretty loud at the Bulldog/Cherry BBQ area. If you want some quiet and piece, there are also plenty of seating in the area near Tokyo Smoke/Nut Bar."}
{"text":"First time coming here with a group of friends, we arrived at a little past 6pm and this place was packed!! Its a little hard to find a table, but that's like any busy food court. The Assembly Chef's Hall houses a wide array of cuisine and specialties from around the world, however their drink selection is quite limited. Their bars and drink venues closed before 8pm, which is a little disappointing. Thankfully they offer free water with lemon slices in one corner of the food court by bulldog cafe.   A couple of us decided it would be a good idea to have a pot luck, so we all went out and ordered food that we wanted, and we all shared the final selection.  I ended up trying truffle fried rice (Dailo), pad gra prao (Little Khao), barachirashi and tekka don (Shari), lobster bisque and rouleau de homard (Bluenose Lobster), and boemo boho gnoch (Resto Boemo). The portions are a little smaller than what I expected, with the price tag being so high. However, it was super fun being able to eat such a wide variety of food in one sitting. I thoroughly enjoyed the pad gra prao, the rouleau de homard (which is just a super fancy way to say warm lobster roll), and the gnoch.   The large pad gra prao comes with so much meat and a soft runny egg, plus they offer chili oil and chili flakes on the side for those who prefer to spice things up. It really takes the dish to a whole new level when you sprinkle that chili oil on top. Similarly, the gnocchi was very well made, super flavorful with a nice mellow truffle oil mixed in. However, my fav would have to be the warm lobster roll. Freshly cooked lobster slaw nested between a warmly toasted bread saturated in buttery goodness, how can you resist that?! Every bite was full of savory bursts of flavor; like the food critics say, \"you gotta try this!\"   Overall this place is a great place to hang out if you don't have a budget on your wallet. There's so much selection that even the pickiest eaters would find something to nibble on. Super friendly service, great atmosphere, and clean facilities. Only downside was that there wasn't much space to put our Canadian winter gears and bags."}
{"text":"This is a  good place for foodies to go .. there are a wide variety of foods to choose from . The one issue I have is with the price.  It is set at a higher price point and not somewhere foodies can go regularly  for the price of food that is charged  we can get different dishes at other restaurants.   However there are some outlets with dishes  that are worth the price and those are what foodies must purchase . But if you are looking for a basic salad, pasta or soup then this is not the place to be  . I will be back once in a while  to check out the area for a unique dish."}
{"text":"I came here twice now for lunch. It's a food hall with many vendors and gets extremely busy during the noon-hour rush. At 1pm, it isn't as busy and finding a table was simple. Good luck trying to get a table at noon. There is a DJ playing music at noon, so it gets loud on both sides of the hall.  My friends and I tried the Bara Chirashi from Shari, which was beautifully presented in a wooden box. The fish was fresh and rice was perfect. I don't know where it comes from, but there was a bit of sweetness in the dish.  We also tried the Pad Gra Prao from Little Khao. It was just as good as the Pad Gra Prao from Khao San Road and Pai. There was plenty of savory pork and I found the egg undercooked.  We tried the Spicy Sopressata Pizza from Good Son. I'm not a fan of olives, but the olives on this pizza wasn't bad. I enjoyed the flavor of the cheese, sauce, and toastiness of the bread. It's definitely spicy, though.  Overall, an excellent place to have lunch, but only when it's not busy."}
{"text":"I liked the concept of the assembly Chef's hall.  I really enjoyed the mushroom taco was disappointed with the chia pudding because they mentioned there was matcha inside when I couldn't taste it at all.    Also I don't like that you can't pay cash at each vendor.  They should have some warning before going in.  You have to go to the bar to do a cash order so ur going up and down the steps just to get your order going lol.  Their cupcakes are pretty dry.  The friend chicken was soft,  the lobster place is pricey.  I don't think I can fork out $17 for a lobster roll that was super tiny.  Not sure if I would go back and try the other stuff.  They had some cool stuff I wanted to try like the vegan nachos but paying $16 for it is where it stops me."}
{"text":"Dropped by for the soft opening - Only a few shops opened but overall great atmosphere and when fully opened will possibly be the best place to eat in the city.  Tried out: Reyna - which had some really good lamb and baklava type sweets.  Short & Sweet Cupcakes - Had the blueberry bar which wasnt overly sweet which i enjoyed very much. Colibris - had a spicy beef taco and a delicious fish taco.   everything was priced very well. Will definitely be back to try out more vendors when they open.  Heres a Video on Assembly Chefs Hall - https://youtu.be/_104sSoIRHw"}
{"text":"This is Toronto's answer to New York's Chelsea Market. There's something for everyone, and it's a great place for any occasion: lunch break, after work drinks, weekend warm up before a night out, a coffee break during work or a place to pop into for the weekend.   It is a tiny bit pricey than the average crappy food court, but you pay for the ambiance, and food wise, you're getting some of the hottest food creations in the city.  Each stall was curated and serve specialty food.  The lobster rolls melt in your mouth, the fried chicken is a burst of different flavours, the truffle gnocchi is tasy and we'll proportioned.  That's only a few selections.  If you're visiting Toronto, you must visit. If you're in Toronto and haven't checked it out, you need to."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love the concept and the food is delicious.   I've eaten at a few places here before and went for drinks more recently. All very good. Will be going back forsure"}
{"text":"So good! The fried chicken sandwich from Love Chix and the tacos from Collibri were amazing."}
{"text":"Food is overpriced but a cool concept and great vibe. I recommend the fried chicken sandwich and the gnocchi."}
{"text":"One of the best lattes I've had in a while! It's so pretty too!! Price was a little high at 7$..."}
{"text":"Amazing new food court very similar to the upscale, modern food courts of NY, like Chelsea Market, Gotham Street Market, etc. I always love the concept of food courts and especially the designs of the stalls and overall space and this one is on point. There's an ample amount of seating, a nice bar to grab drinks and chill and 15+ different stalls inside the \"food court\".   It's a little more on the pricey side for the portions given, but the food is still pretty high quality though it's a food court and there are stall versions of popular restaurants like Khao San Road and Isshin Ramen. It's just more fun to try out some different foods with a group of friends in one place and all share things of a different cuisine.   Me and my friends ended up trying Ramen Isshin, Khao San Road, and Mira Mira's. They were all pretty different dishes, so it was fun to try them all, but I think the Chicken with Kale Cesar at Mira Mira was the best of the three.   Very convenient location in Downtown Toronto and a good place to meet up with friends and chill."}
{"text":"What a fantastic space! Two beautiful dining areas with different types of seating, and a patio. That. PATIO.  Last Saturday, I came here for my first visit, with 2 other friends.  We made purchases at two vendors: palettas/popcicles from PalettAmerica, the stand-up omakase at Tachi.  Both were great experiences. For Tachi's review, please visit their page: https://www.yelp.ca/biz/tachi-toronto-2?hrid=RQYZ3QUiql6ytGF_QU4sVA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)  As for PalettAmerica: we had wonderful service, the treats looks so captivating and tastes great!    We had the pina colada & strawberry cheesecake palettas. The pina colada was VERY soft - which we were warned about. But the flavour was spot-on, delish and refreshing. Highly recommended - but yes, be warned that it melts faster than other flavours there.  The strawberry cheesecake holds up better. It's beautiful and tastes exactly as you'd expect. Creamy, with gram cracker bits reminiscent of a crust, and strawberry flavour throughout.  Definitely a fantastic place for summer treat! Perfect for this current heat wave. ;)  Can't wait to come back to Assembly to try all the other vendors!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing and it's a great place for friends with different cravings. Prices are too high for me to come here regularly since it ultimately is just a food court..."}
{"text":"What a neat little place. Think seperate food stations housed under one roof. It's pretty easy to find an option you would like, and though I didn't order anything for lunch, I'm keen to try it out someday. They have pizza, bbq, bowls, pasta, fusion inspired and bistro style menu choices.   I only ordered a chai tea latte with macadamia milk. But I'm glad they have non-dairy options. And if you don't want to eat indoors, you can go to the courtyard patio and enjoy the (relatively) fresh air.   Yay for lunchtime! Thanks to this place."}
{"text":"I love the concept and love how each store has displays of the dishes they serve. Wish they had a menu that combined all the stores or something to make it easier to decide and what's offered."}
{"text":"I visited Assembly on the Grand Opening night and fell in love with the space, the food and the concept.  I dont know what the usual portions are and their prices are but i expect its between a food court and proper service restaurant but the convenience of getting whatever you want with really high quality food that you can eat quickly or take time to linger with friends and collegues is amazing.  From the Pizza to the freshest sushi you can try all kinds of great things there.  I hope the concept takes over the generic low quality chain food courts."}
