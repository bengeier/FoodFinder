{"text":"Went there today with 3 of my colleagues. Another colleague had said that their Veal Sandwiches are better than California's and I kid you not... THEY WERE!! The service was excellent, restaurant was nice and clean and staff/ owners were friendly. We got 3 Veal Sandwiches and 1 Chicken Sandwich and boy we were all happy. The bun was really soft, the sauce in the sandwich was just the right amount (unlike California's where you have to do a hand-wash after) and the patty was great! We all loved it and commended the owners of the fine sandwich they had created. They have only been open for 10 weeks or so and LLBO license will be happening soon... check the place out! You will not be disappointed..."}
{"text":"Have no clue why this place is so highly rated. Ordered a pizza from them ..I think know it was Sicilian and it's by far the worst pizza I have eaten. Greasy but very dry on sauce."}
{"text":"This place gets a lot of hype - maybe because of the name. In my opinion, nothing special about the pizza here - the food is OK. The speed isn't that great. They do have outdoor seating.. I have had better quality Italian Pizza elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nice little spot to grab a quick lunch as you head down the Queensway with parking right out front. Best deals are during lunch when they offer $5 sandwiches. Kind of interesting is the seating up near the front window where there is a couch to sit at while eating at a table. What a concept! Alternate between making out and having your dinner?"}
{"text":"I've had their pizza and 3 different sandwiches, everything so far is really good.  The guys working here actually care about the food - they understand that quality equals success.  Most of the time I just pick up a sandwich.  The chicken sandwich is amazing, you wont be disappointed.  If you like Prosciutto, get it here!  The combination of the bocconcini compliments the salty prosciutto and the pesto w/ garlic.  Well done guys.  The only small problem is that they use canned mushrooms for the topping on sandwiches.  Booo.  Everything else is legit."}
{"text":"I'm getting frustrated with all these restaurants trying to identify as Italian. The pizza here just doesn't cut it. The veal sandwich is a pass but I would expect the owner would wash his hands after his smoke and before making our order. That is never acceptable, especially when patrons are watching you."}
{"text":"terrible. go to il paesano, calibreze, milanos... much better pizza is nearby. honestly it tasted as close to a frozen pizza out of the box as i can recall..  NOT GOOD."}
{"text":"All their sandwiches and pastas are AMAZING. They have a great lunch special - any sandwich or pasta for $5 - a great deal for the portion.   My fav sandwiches are the veal, meatball and prosciutto sandwich."}
