{"text":"We have our Christmas party here every year and every year it is good food and good service. A bit crowded but given the establishment size that Is not the restaurant's fault."}
{"text":"Food and pricing is fair. Service and table maintenance need lots of work!! I can not stand dirty plates EVERYWHERE!! Disgusting!! Obviously, the management is unaware of what guests expect. I would like to let them know that customers like to have their dirty dishes removed from the table when they are finished eating. Just sayin', but I could be wrong. They were NOT that busy that we had to endure, for the last time(!) this ineptness. Seems like an alright place, but service standards should be reviewed. There were 6 or 7 tables on the patio, and four of them had dirty dishes piled on them and no one sitting at the table. The busser showed up once during our entire meal and the servers never touched a dirty dish. Too bad, Haymaker and Tailgaters are close by and seem to be a lot more on the ball."}
{"text":"Had the \"All you can eat\" fish fry. Servise good, food just average. Too noisy."}
{"text":"I go to lakeside for allllll! Of my ufc events, the hospitality is amazing, food is great, atmosphere is great! They have awesome servers too just all around great place"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Great food, nice patio, great service. Thank you Kayla for taking great care of us! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to watch the game and had a great time! Margie bartender was 'Amazing' served very good drinks! Very polite, and made me feel at home! The Wings was the best I've had in the Valley! Fired Pickle was awesome! I will be back! Try this place out! Want be disappointed. I'm a professional eater in the Valley!"}
{"text":"I am really impressed with the changes lately!  Everything from the staff to the food seemed to have gotten a \"facelift\" and I will definitely be going back.  Even though we sat at the bar to eat, our bartender catered to us, gave a good food and wine recommendation and even took care of us personally when we opted to sit on the patio half way through our meal.  I especially love that the manager, Clint, came and checked on us 2x to make sure we were satisfied.  Thank you, Lakeside for a wonderful afternoon with my BF."}
{"text":"We've eaten here on a few occasions over the past couple years. We have never been that impressed with the food. We decided to try brunch this morning, walked in and added our name to the list. I went inside to look at the bar and asked the bartender if the high tops were open seating. She said yes so I grabbed the family and we sat down. Two minutes later the hostess came to us stating they were understaffed and there's a wait. I told the hostess I had asked thee bartender and she said I must have misheard what the bartender told me. We left without haste! Good luck... we'll invest our hard earned dollars in many of the other restaurants around the same area..."}
{"text":"Food was good but the server was spacey Kept on forgetting our coffee and salad dressing"}
{"text":"First time into Lakeside Bar & Grill, but it certainly won't be the last!  From the get-go it was a great experience. We were seated immediately and our server, Matt, was da bomb!  He was able to make great recommendations and has a super personality. Service was great; attentive but not pushy. Good lighting, a comfy booth & lots of TVs will appeal to most. And the food?  Amazing!  We had cream of mushroom soup that was house made and the stuff of foodie dreams. We also had the spaghetti marina w/meatballs. The pasta was spot, on-cooked to order, and the marinara was great, with just a hint of heat. The meatballs were sublime, tender and bursting with flavor. Add a great margarita and the hubster and I were happy campers!"}
{"text":"Kinda cool atmosphere, food is ok, staff ok. An ok place for a quick drink and bite to eat."}
{"text":"Service is horrible, my Granddaughter and I arrived at 6:09 PM on Sunday evening.  Place wasn't all that busy.  We ordered a Hamburger and a Sandwich.  After 30 minutes we asked the waitress if there was a problem with our food and she said it takes longer because we ordered the burger med well.  I stated it shouldn't take that long even with being med well.  Several more times we asked about our food only to be told each time it would be right out.  After an hour the manager came over to apologize for the delay - he couldn't tell us what the delay was other than they were busy (which they clearly were not).  By this time we watched 3 other tables come in, order and receive their food while we still waited. After 69 minutes we finally received our food, and the manager offered us a dessert for free.  I will never go back to this place again.They couldn't even be honest about what the problem was for the delay."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers! I've said it before and I'll say it again, I'm a burger snob. I am such a sucker for a great burger and Lakeside has them. They have other great food as well. Service is \"ok\" which is why I knocked off a star but only because it is always really busy."}
{"text":"There's not many places to go out to eat in the far northwest valley.  My wife and I have stopped in three times hoping for a mediocre meal and passable service just so we don't have to drive 25 miles to find a dinner when we don't feel like cooking.  Lakeside is just plain bad.  They serve a variety of foods and are good at preparing none of them.  Sandwiches are on crunchy, burnt (stale?) bread with too little, poor quality meat.  Italian dishes have soggy pasta with flavorless sauces, I've tasted better from a jar - which is obviously where they get theirs.  Each time we've been in to try out their not fresh, bland food the restaurant was about 1/3rd full and it took nearly two hours from being seated immediately to getting a check.  We ordered 1 drink each, 1 main and no appetizer or dessert ... I think they have the world's slowest microwaves because that's where the food tastes like it came from, why the wait?"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a yummy burger and cold beer. Always a \"pleasant\" experience when we eat here."}
{"text":"The good: we could bring the dog and they had a special dog menu!  The bad: forgot Grandma's meal! Sat for a very long time before someone checked in and could be reminded she had not received her meal.  The ugly: food was just okay.  Way too many fabulous food choices to settle for mediocre - even with the dog."}
{"text":"This place is awful!!! I will ever step foot in this filthy place again.  I realize it's \"bar food\" in that case quit hiking up the prices. Sat at the bar to see not 1 but 2 cockroaches. This is not the first time we have had issues with bugs there. Maybe instead of making the place bigger, putting in more TV's and making crappy food, you should invest in a exterminator and new chef.   The food is not good tastes like crap they got at the dollar store. Hummus that looks like it was scooped out of a tub and plopped on a plate along side some dry carrots and celery. Yet claim to make it fresh. Highly doubtful given this place serves Kraft macaroni and cheese for $6.  I'm ready for lakeside to go!!"}
{"text":"Food was awful - worse than cafeteria food. Only reason it's not a 1 star is the fact that they have several TV's to watch the games."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming into Lakeside for several years now, and I must say we are never disappointed! Starting from when we first enter the restaurant, the hostesses are always so friendly and eager to get us sat right away. The wait staff is just as great, most of them know my husband and I by name and make it a pleasure for us to be there. I usually get the fajitas and drink a nice margarita and my husband ALWAYS gets the pastrami. They have a great happy hour and fair prices all around. We are so happy to see how far this restaurant has come!"}
{"text":"The food was so great, I went back and ordered it again the next day.  Brought my dog with me both days.  They truly are dog friendly.  A special menu just for your dog is on the back of the menu.    Just one suggestion, if they are reading this.  Corn is in the dog stew, and this item is not healthy for dogs...might want to consider removing this one ingredient.    I will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The fish fry Friday is a bit too oily for our liking, be we have not had a bad meal here.  They are always attentive, food is fresh, and overall ambiance of the restaurant is nice.  They have various events and specials throughout the week.  Great spot!  Try it out"}
{"text":"Came by for the fish fry. They did not disappoint. Beer battered fish and all you can eat.  Even the cole slaw was excellent. Typical bar with a mix of high top and regular tables.   Brandy did a great job keeping us supplied with drinks and fish."}
{"text":"Drove from Surprise to eat on the patio. Such a beautiful day to be ruined by the worse service ever. Had to go get our own beers and was told a server would be sent out which never happened.  A shame cause the patio is setup so perfectly.  Was told they were short staffed and we noticed the manager left to get in her car and leave for the day.  Not to mention several people have dogs which is causing them to jump, bark, and fight. Since when do non service animals get to come to an eating establishment.   Avoid this place unless your sitting inside."}
{"text":"Checked a week ahead to make sure there would be room for 17 people on the following Sat. at 6:00PM  When we arrived, no one knew what we were talking about.  The help was very gracious and offered water to anyone that had not visited the bar. We waited about half an hour, which wasn't bad, considering he place was packed.  The staff was very friendly, as were the customers.  They made friendly comments as we worked our way to the back of the room.  Curtis was our server and did a great job.  Everyone liked their meals and we all had a good time."}
{"text":"We are locals and have been dining at the Lakeside since the first day of opening.   If you're looking for a great place to eat that offers more than \"bar\" food then this is the place to enjoy a fabulous meal.  The pasta martini up with olives is to die for!   Great food, service and happy hour specials make us returning customers!"}
{"text":"Both times I've been here the staff has been very friendly. Loved the smoked wings! Fun atmosphere to watch the football games although most of the tvs had one game and the other few scrolling through games. Nice patio area and fair prices."}
{"text":"It was wacky Wednesday......Just left the Lakeside Bar and Grill,  Husband and I ordered Lakeside burgers.  Menu states that you get your choice of Swiss, Provolone or Cheddar cheese.  Had a waiter that was very confrontational and rude.  We got our bill and got charged an up charge for cheese.  Drinks were very, very weak.   Seems like Lakeside is giving themselves a cheap name.  Lakeside lost our business."}
{"text":"Me and my husband love Lakeside! We have been coming here since it opened. Great happy hour! Never disappointed in the food and they always have fun activities that are not offered at other bars. Me and my husband have come during football games and UFC fight nights and the atmosphere is always amazing. I have also participated in their canvas painting evenings and me and my girlfriends had a blast. Great way to have a fun relaxing evening with cocktails. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"We love Lakeside Bar and Grill!  The service, food and atmosphere is great! I for one am a fan of the fact that they put kraft mac and cheese right there on the menu.  As a mother of a picky eater it was nice to know that there was an option for my child!  As for their regular menu, it is fabulous!  We love the turkey wrap and the \"sorry\" flavored shrimp appetizer.  Tommasina runs a fantastic restaurant.  It has quickly become one of our favorite spots!"}
{"text":"I just LOVE this place!! We've been coming here for a while now and the service is always on point! And the food is amazing! I always try to order something different and I am never disappointed! Jose the manager really knows how to make it a personal experience and Michelle the normal bartender on Saturdays is awesome! If you come in ask Michelle for her \"white gummy bear\" shot (if you like sweet) it's amazing!! It's our regular \"date night\" get away!"}
{"text":"The dog friendly factor is the attraction for me here. There's a big difference between being truly dog friendly and merely dog tolerant in restaurants, and Lakeside really gets that. They lavish attention on their pet-in-tow customers here. My best friend, Archie, has been treated to big, shiny bowls of iced water and milk bones every time we visit. He's enjoyed burgers and meatballs from their doggie menu, too. Lakeside knows that the path to a pet-loving customer's heart starts at the furry end of a leash, and through treating my dog as well as they do, they've trained me to come back to them time and again."}
{"text":"Usually good food and good service.  Ate there on Easter (one of the few places open) and had the Fajitas.  Have to say they were some of the best I have ever had.  Better than most Mexican Restaurants."}
{"text":"For the first time I find a place that I enjoy coming in and eating my food with joy. Loved all the food, ambiance and wonderful service! Keep up with the great work! Can't wait to come back and try the fish and chips oh! FREE on Tuesday to feed my kids in case I don't feel like cooking :) Dessert here we come!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour pricing on beers and the food is good. We've always sat at the bar and have never really experienced an amazingly friendly bartender but the atmosphere is relaxing and they usually have all of the games on that we are looking for."}
{"text":"Very good...the concept is strange but I do love their food and drinks :)"}
{"text":"Love Lakeside Grill!  Had great service with our server, Connor - come in and ask for Connor and tell him Garry and Jan sent you"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my mom & had a wonderful experience. Excellent service, friendly staff (our server Matt was awesome) fun/colorful atmosphere with high quality, delicious food. It's the kind of place u want to come back to over & over again.   I ordered the chicken club sandwich with beer battered onion rings which were the best I've ever had! (NOT greasy) the grilled chicken was tasty & juicy; not overdone. My mom ordered the All American Burger with French Frys & she said it was \"outstanding\", a thick hand-made patty with obviously lean ground beef. Fresh fixings & tasty Fry's too.   We'd definitely come back to eat our way thru the diverse & delicious menu. ;-))"}
{"text":"Half price all tap beers for happy hour along with a few appetizers.   Big bar.  Potato skins are good.  Fries are very good.  Never had anything else there.  Supposed to be great for the games.  Nothing to write home about (only a review, lol) , but I'll be back."}
{"text":"I can't believe I just wasted my money there. Absolutely disgusting. Waited over 40 minutes for our food which came out ice cold. My burger bun was hard and the meat was more of an unseasoned rubber. My son could not eat his grilled cheese as it was as hard as a rock. Not to mention our waiter was the worst I have EVER had. Didn't check on us for over 30 minutes nor did he care we had been waiting for such a long time. He had 4 tables. Inexcusable."}
{"text":"This is a great pub restaurant! The food is really good with everything from burgers to salmon to coconut shrimp! They've got good specials, outside seating with heaters/misters (you can bring your dog), decent service (sit at the bar if you can they rock it!!) and the manager must live there! He fixes any issues on the spot! Great little local place. Fun for groups or solo."}
{"text":"This place is okay but not fantastic. The food will do the trick when you're hungry and want something a little better than Chili's but it depends on what you get. I really like the coconut shrimp and get it almost every time because the dipping sauce is delicious. Their salmon is okay but I can make something similar at home and it's a little pricey. I wish they had a healthier option on their kids menu. Some of their sandwiches are decent. I haven't tried a burger yet. The service is spotty. Sometimes it's great and other times it is slow.   I do love to take advantage of Kids Eat Free on Tuesday nights. It makes it affordable for my family of five to eat out. There could be some improvements but overall, I have come back here on occasion for a casual night out. We usually go Tuesdays and, honestly, that's what brings me back!"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere and great attentive service with a smile! Definitely coming back ! Highly recommend the happy hour, they have amazing drinks !"}
{"text":"The food here is awful. Got the buffalo chicken wrap and onion rings. The onion rings were not hot and not fresh. The wrap was insanely salty. My husband got a burger and it was pretty obvious they use lowest quality meat. It was not flavorful, dried out, also weirdly salty. The French fries are reminiscent of what was available in the school cafeteria. Service was slow. We had a reservation and knew we had 10 people coming, yet it still took 10 minutes after we showed up to get seated. The place was not busy. The food was over priced for what it was. I would have rather gone to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"We were on our way to Twisted Italian just across the way from here but we found ourselves deciding to try a new place, not a good decision.  The place was packed, we looked at this as a good sign, the only table they had open inside was a high top and my wife cannot stand them so we opted for the patio.  Call me naive but i had no idea that the patios in AZ are open for smoking....and as we approached the restaurant the patio is located right off the entrance and there was a large family party, 2 elderly couples, and another table that was occupied. No indications that the patio was a smoking area nor did the hostess clue us in that the patio is open for smoking.  We were sat, ordered our drinks and an appetizer and shortly after that we were engulfed in a cloud of smoke.  Two couples were sat around us and immediately sparked up, this almost instantly had the occupied table when we got there follow suit...it drove the elderly couples out and the family started to rush their dinner.  I was praying our entrees would come soon so we could get out ourselves because there nothing to be had inside at this time.  Our waiter, David, was fantastic and tried to accommodate us the best he could and that is why we gave to stars, for DAVID!  I had the Philly steak and it was VERY bland, my wife said the spaghetti was just ok, the highlight of the meal, besides the service, was the pickle fries if they were just not so greasy.  So needless to say after putting our lungs through all the torture the food left us wanting.  Next time when we are on our way somewhere we will continue to our destination and not opt for \"something new!\""}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere of this place but unfortunately was really disappointed in the food and service.   The pretzels and cheese appetizer tasted like the pretzels were reheated for too long. They were stale and chewy. The sandwiches all tasted like they were soaked in butter before they were toasted on the pan.The server didn't bring everyone water, so when we ordered the water, they were forgotten about. Then they were never refilled when finished. I understand, servers get busy. But things can be done about incorrect food orders (below)..   I originally was going to order a veggie fajita, but it came with no beans or rice and if I wanted that added, it would be an up-charge. I decided to order a fajita burrito, with no meat, since this entree came with beans and rice and was less expensive than my other option and was basically the same thing.   After I waited awhile for my food, my burrito was stuffed with beans and rice and they gave me a side of beans and rice as well. This was not what I ordered, as my burrito was supposed to be stuffed with peppers and onions - like a fajita.   I took a few bites, because I was starving and also because the waitress took a very long time to come check on us. I told her about the messed up order and she offered to bring me a side of veggies. This really isn't the same thing... I wanted what I was paying for.   We had a table of 8, and I feel we really should have been comped one free meal or free dessert or appetizer or something, but instead, we were charged the full price for a meal I didn't even want and only took a couple of bites out of.   It was a pretty sad first experience here and none of us will be returning."}
{"text":"Nathan was right on with the service, and the all you can eat fish was delicious and well worth the price!"}
{"text":"Although it is bar food, it is good bar food.  The service is good.  There are plenty of great beers on tap.  There is a patio that is cigar friendly.  The wings are good.  The servers will change the station with a smile.  It is a fun environment.  We go once or twice a month."}
{"text":"Yo yo Az friends ... If you a want a sports bar that offers great tasting food and great tasting beer options then head on out to Lakeside Grill . If your a football fantasy buff then this is the place for you ! With 21 big screens your sure to catch your favorite game service was right on and the price was very affordable ! As always don't take my word for it grab your favorite buds, grab your BFF and try it for yourself! Enjoy."}
{"text":"me and my fiance have been regulars here for a long time ... the other night we met another couple  out for dinner before hand... decided after that we would have a drink at lakeside .. we mostly go in there for there sunday drink specials and appetizers . so are intentions were to have a few cocktails .. among sitting down ordering us all a round of waters we got apporached by a very rude younger lady, who claimed to be the manager, telling us that they could not serve us because they 'ASSUMED' we were drinking at another establishment prior... we had ONE drink at dinner and by no means were out of controll ... we all were almost in shock and being with my friend who is also a bartender she said that is not a law, and who are they to say that we were even drinking before hand ... when every other person in there was wasted out there minds. i honestly think it was discrimination he apparently didnt like our energetic energy and simply didnt want  us there needless to say us and everyone we have ever referred there will never be back.... what a shame . i have looked and loooked for an email address to contacact a supervisor or owner, the waty we were treated was unexceptable . any help  with anyone knowing or finding a direct e mail for there bar letme know th good luck guys"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a few years decided to give it another shot. Took seven kids and a friend the wings were outstanding the chicken tenders outstanding the bacon protein burger with sweet potato fries I will order again. They messed up my girlfriend sandwich but had it fixed within less than two minutes. The outstanding waiter was accommodating because you know when you have seven children it can get chaotic. The hostess they could maybe retrain to improve her customer service and the bar staff was chatting in the corner like high school girls.  I'd go back again."}
{"text":"We love heading up to the corner for yummy wings and fried zucchini. And if you're a fan of meatballs and spaghetti, theirs is better than any italian restaurant around. Something for everyone. Large place but staffed well and super casual. Rarely a wait. One of our favs!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner tonight.  Been here once before and the food was ok. We decided that it was a nice night and we could sit outside. The service and food were good. As we are enjoying our food, three guys walked outside with a drink and lit up cigarettes.  When we asked them to please move to the end,  they informed us that it was a smoking patio. The manager confirmed that and offered to move us to the non-smoking patio on the other side.  Really?  Shouldn't that have been an option at the beginning?  The food smells of smoke and we couldn't eat it at that point.  The manager comped our food and we only paid for drinks,  but they should let their customers know that it is a smoking patio and offered to seat us at the other patio when we got there. The non-smoking patio was not open when we left and that is probably why we weren't seated there.  I don't think the food was that exceptional to go back..... Too many other places to try."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant based on the recommendation of the 85085 magazine. We ordered the pastrami sandwich with half fries and onion rings based on the magazines review that the pastrami was piled high. The sandwich was tasty however the pastrami  was not piled high at all but was disappointing lacking in pastrami plus the order came with only three small onion rings. The bill came and we noticed they up charged us for the onion rings. So we questioned the up charge and the server took it to his manager who agreed to take off $0.49. Really!! That's a poor business decision and really poor customer service. We won't be back nor will we recommend this restaurant based on the poor decision not to take the up charge off the bill."}
{"text":"My daughter and I checked in here and ate a couple months ago and it was really terrible and barely anything in my philly steak sandwich. Because I checked in (through FB) they asked me for a review and I was honest. I was impressed how much they seemed to care and they quickly called me and sent me a voucher to come back. This past Sunday me and my family did. OMG it was just terrible. My husband had a club sandwich and soup thinking they really couldn't mess that up but the clam chowder tasted like potato bacon soup and the sandwich was so dry. He didn't eat much, my taco salad was seriously so bad that I barely ate it and our waitress was friendly when we saw her but not interested in being a good waitress. This place on a Sunday was pretty empty also which speaks volumes. They used to be great but things have changed a lot and I don't anticipate them surviving much longer. I don't like giving bad reviews and did ask to see Jose since his name was on our buy 1 entree get the other free but I never saw him. I will be giving our free appetizer voucher away because we have no intentions on wasting any more money here."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it! Spot on service by Becky, food was really good and reminded us of one of our favorite places in chandler that we moved away from. Jose the GM, came over and introduced himself to us, cause he heard it was our first time in. We thought that was really cool. Don't always read the negative comments, check it out for yourself and make your own decision. We will be back for sure! Maybe even tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Fish fry was awful. Especially at 20% more $ than other local houses. Fresh cod? I'm absolutely doubting that!  Beer batter was heavy, bland, and salty.  Served no with vinegar...but it wouldn't have helped this flavorless fare.  I called later and spoke directly to a manager about the \"not fresh cod\" ...she did not dispute this!...only instead replying that the fish \"is commissaried\" in. The menu looks like it belongs in a cafeteria.  And so do many of the items.  And so do most of the flavors.  Bland a la bland."}
{"text":"Thanks to the Bartender Tiffany for taking care of us after the Superbowl. This is the closest bar to our place at Vistancia and we will be back"}
{"text":"Had a turkey wrap for lunch with seasoned veggies(broccoli,carrots and string beans). Veggies were over cooked and not hot. Turkey wrap was mostly lettuce with a small amount of turkey . Supposed to come with some sort of cranberry dressing but didn't. Service was good. Might go back to try something different."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here several times. We always sit at the bar and get good service. We like the special events like Trivia and Karaoke. They have good specials for Happy Hour. However, I have been a couple of times with friends and sat at tables instead of bar and service wasn't that good. The last time I was there the waitress forgot to bring an extra ranch and never asked if I needed more water. It wasn't busy so I didn't see any reason that she wouldn't be able to take care of us. Other than that I like it, but will probably only go for happy hour when we can sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries. You get a lot of food and it's a good value.  Service was pretty good, a little on the slow side."}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner and drinks. Love the decor, there's an actual glider hanging from the ceiling! Drinks were tasty and I had the salmon for dinner which was perfectly cooked. Good choice for my first night visiting Arizona. Haley was our waitress and was very friendly and helpful, thanks Haley!"}
{"text":"Update*  We gave it another try. Service was much better and food was amazing!  The best fagitas I have probably ever had and such a great atmosphere. Curtis was very pleasant to have as a waiter.      Food was great. Service was horrible. They didn't have any clean booths when we walked in and we're annoyed when we wanted to wait for a clean one. When asking for another side of ranch the waitress replied with, \"Really? Another one?\" Then she never brought it. I ordered the club sandwich from the lunch menu and they charged me for the lakeside club (a completely different name) which is a few dollars more and when asked about it they said you have to tell them you are ordering from the lunch menu. Very rude. Understaffed. Not sure we will return."}
{"text":"Nice to have a local bar that doesn't destroy the budget! Awesome happy hour and top notch service from Corrine at the bar. She took the time to explain happy hour specials and the level of heat from those delicious wings. Have been before for the all-you-can-stuff-your-face-with-fish on a Friday and was worth it. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place, the burgers are very good, the wings are great as well, and the bartender usually our first service with a smile. The servers, however, our untrained and clumsy, and seem like they don't want to work and every little backrest is a burden. The patio is nice, and the kids meals are good"}
{"text":"The service here is terrible and the food mediocre.  I was hoping it would improve but never does.  Lazy and wholly disinterested in the customers.  Horribly slow would be a vast improvement. Can only be the result of poor management."}
{"text":"Good burgers and salads. Drinks are a bit overpriced for happy hour especially when there are bars in the area with much better deals."}
{"text":"My wife and I literally highfived and said never again as we were walking to our car.  The lady at the front was very nice then our waitress started out rude until my wife mentioned how lousy the service was right in front of her then she started to come around.  I had a BBQ burger and my wife had fish n chips.  The BBQ burger was okay.  It had a huge onion ring on top and could have used more sauce.  The bun was large but plain.  The lettuce was old and the meat could have been juicier.  The French fries were good.  Our order of onion rings were chewy in the middle and I would have liked them cooked longer and crunchier.  My wife's fish n chips were very oily.  They didn't offer vinegar or any condiments for that matter.  They also only gave us two napkins and I asked for a few more and was given two more.  I'm not sure if there is a napkin shortage but you may want to bring some from home.    All in all it was not good at all except the French fries I suppose.  We both wished we went somewhere else and had a bad taste in our mouths.  It was a $30 lesson learned.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Lakeside continues to slip. Had the bbq bacon burger for $10.99 on a Tuesday. This is an 11 dollar burger and they do not toast or grill the bun. The cheese is not melted and the beef is unseasoned. My wife's Caesar was way over dressed. Taps are dominated by four peaks who sold their soul to Budweiser. I am done with lakeside. It used to be great but let themselves go."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I am done with this place.  Went last Sunday to meet a friend. When I got there they called me and said they were going to be an hour late.  I mentioned this to the hostess.  Apparently at Lakeside this equals no service until your dining partner shows up.  Host brought one beer.  Complained about service after sitting there for 30 min. Asked for check said server would pick up. They didn't.  They charged me for the $2.50 beer which I thought was tacky.  Left called friend and met somewhere else.  There were 20 people in the place max so there really was no excuse."}
{"text":"My kids,my hubby and I love this place. We eat here alot. I love their burger with bacon on top yummy! And the kids are always welcome their which is a plus with the bar noise its even with the kids lol."}
{"text":"We went as a family with two kids...5 and 1.  The kids split a kids meal grilled cheese which was plenty for the two of them.  The grilled cheese was fairly large.  My husband had the meatball sandwich, again very good size, there was enough I could have a little.  I had a Cesar salad which was ok, it didn't taste like it was homemade, more of a bagged mix with bottled dressing, but a good piece of bread came with it.    Their happy hour prices were great.  We were also happy with the beer selection.  It was very busy at 5:30 on a Friday, but with the amount of space they have we were seated right away."}
{"text":"Our first visit was last Friday at the busiest hour on the busiest day and we were seated within 10 minutes.  The hostesses were wonderful and efficient.  The drinks were cold and delicious.  The service was great and quick and the server was very friendly.  The manager, Clint, was very attentive to everyone in the place and he stopped by our table at least 3 times making sure everything was great as we told him this was our first visit.  We will return often!  Thank you, Clint! BTW... the food was DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast  first time , they only serve breakfast on Sundays. But it was excellent and very reasonable, but what made them standout was the service they provided, they explained up front that they were busier than expected and there may be a wait for service , but that never happened, all the staff went out of their way to make sure we were serviced and did an excellent job. They showed the true meaning of customer service and thought they should be acknowledged for it GREAT JOB"}
{"text":"This place looked good. Had family come in from the east coast. We went there for lunch while I was on my lunch break and it didn't appear to be busy. We ordered and it took so long I had to leave without eating. Our waitress didn't even bother to inform us our food was taking long until we asked. She had some excuse that it was because our hamburgers. Never had I had to wait 45 mins for a burger and still not get it. Horrible place. Will never return!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good here I just had a bad experience with the night bartender. Just rude and unfriendly. I wasn't the only one that noticed this in my party.        You try and go to a bar and enjoy yourself and we did do that but the last person you need to put a damper on the night is the bartender herself.       Oh well I really want to like this place because I don't have many choices in the neighborhood. But the next time I spend a hard earned 100 bucks it won't be here not as long as the service is bad."}
{"text":"My son and I love this spot...great sports, the food is awesome and fresh, and the service is fantastic. Love this spot!"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night around 6:45, so it was busy. It would have been ok waiting 40 minutes for our food but the server didn't communicate how long it would be or provide any updates, even though she walked by us a dozen times. After asking for an update, boom our food shows up, so that doesn't leave you with the best feeling. The fish fry was very good. The wings are probably some of the best in the Phoenix area. The vibe is very \"Sun City\" friendly, good, bad or indifferent!"}
{"text":"We were here on a Sunday afternoon, 1st time visit.  GREAT PLACE!  Our waiter was a cool dude, actually one of the better waiter's I've ever had.  Recommended the local beer Four Peaks Kilt Lifter, great stuff!  We ordered the all you can eat soup and salad, decent price.  I had the soup of the day, a brisket lobster soup (not sure of exact name).  The soup was outstanding!  Caesar salad was also prepared perfectly.  Had wings as an appetizer, about average on the wings meter.    Restaurant was VERY CLEAN throughout.  Lighting and music at a comfortable volume.  Greeter wasn't the friendliest, not terrible, just had a bit of an attitude.  But she did ask if we were looking to watch a particular game.  The greeter was really the only negative about our experience.  We noticed they were kid friendly.  We finished with carrot cake for desert.  As a huge carrot cake fan, this carrot cake rated very high for me.  The crowd was classy, and several well placed screens were playing a WIDE VARIETY OF CURRENT GAMES.    Comfortable indoor and outdoor seating options, nice layout.  About 15 minutes from Lake Pleasant, and I did get the feeling of GOOD TIMES LAKE SIDE.  {{SIDE RANT}} Regarding some of the negative reviews, it seems that the experience is not the same later at night.  I think in the area after 10 or 11pm this is always going to be the case.  The late crowds want to party like it's Vegas packed clubs out here, but I don't feel this is Lakeside's intention.  Customers should be happy and grateful a bar of such status is open after 11pm in the area.  Look at your environment when at Lakeside, be aware of others.  Relax, chill out, enjoy the breeze.  A few jackasses get a few drinks in them, and they bullhorn self centered times.  I recommend taking the high volume drinking, packed club mentality to a more densely populated area of Phoenix.  Or at least go to Brookside in Surprise for that lame crap. {{SIDE RANT END}}  KEEP IT CHILL @ LAKESIDE!  I plan to return for HAPPY HOUR in the future, 3-7pm drinks half off+."}
{"text":"Went in to lake side the other day for lunch hadn't been in, in a while service was solid, food was really good and quick. Had the chicken slider... Try them !"}
{"text":"Still love this place! Awesome service! Food is A plus ( for a picky eater ME :-) Sunday special is great with all you can eat salad and soup for $7.99, $3 Mimosa and Bloody Mary They also have a menu under 500 calories. Still the BEST wings and fries (really)"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place !!! We just moved to Arizona and this is our new most FAVORITE place to have a drink and relax with amazing service and food !!! Every time we come, we have our favorite server Krissy and sit out on the patio and chill!!! Krissy is awesome... Funny, fun, super nice and attentive AKA the PERFECT SERVER!!! We really enjoy her personally and are always happy to see her !!! We also can bring our dog, Snoop when we sit on the patio and not only do they shower him with lots of love, but they bring him a bowl of water and a treat !!! We always order a grilled chicken breast off their doggie menu so Snoop is in Heaven!!! This place truly is a wonderful respite and omg don't get me started on their nachos !!!! Lol!!!"}
{"text":"Slowly turning in to one of our favorites on the West side. Wings are phenomenal! Get them grilled. Fish fry is great. Burgers look great. Would try one but I have to order those wings every time! Bright fun atmosphere with a nice entertainment schedule. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Went for Dueling Pianos and was not disappointed! I had the southwest salad and it was fantastic. Everyone was more than satisfied with their food, and a friend commented that she has loved everything she has ever tried at Lakeside. The patio is pet-friendly, though I did not see any pets when I was there. I absolutely plan to return, probably with my dog, because Lakeside has an amazing atmosphere and really awesome food."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! The coleslaw that came with the burger had no dressing on it. The burgers were not cooked to order. The burger buns are incredibly dry. Very understaffed."}
{"text":"Went for one app and a glass of wine. My husband had a beer. We waiting one hour. No wings. Walked out.   *UPDATE* Thought we'd try you guys a second time. Well. If I could give zero stars I would. I'm 6 months pregnant and you just served up a full alcohol Bloody Mary after I requested a virgin. Took a big drink of that. I'm raging mad.  Then there is no service. Like none. The guy is nowhere to be found. Wings have been sitting here. No plates. No napkins. No forks. Nothing. This place is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Good place for a bite to eat! Lots to choose from on the menu. Fun atmosphere, with a \"lake pleasant\" type theme (wakeboards and water toys on the walls). Plenty of tvs to watch all the games.  Food came out nice and hot! Prices are real reasonable. I recommend the philly steak n cheese."}
{"text":"This was my first visit.  The Friday fish fry was AMAZING!   It was fresh and perfect.  The service was incredible and the ambiance was fun.  Everything we ordered was incredible.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"People bitch about the food but I don't think Lakeside is shooting for upscale cuisine on their menu. It's a bar that happens to serve food. What I do like is: - Dog friendly patio - Cool decor (the owner made the bar & the glider)  - Lots of regulars - Kid friendly  - Nice staff - In the area -- it's by far the best \"bar\"!! It has a great neighborhood feel, great patio, fun fun fun place to watch football, and good drink and food specials."}
{"text":"Great patio service with a smile! And a fresh bowl of cool water for the dog. What a great way to enjoy MLK JR. DAY by way of a leisurely family lunch!  Our party ordered the Grilled Chicken Caesar Wrap, Turkey Cranberry Wrap, & Philly Cheese with sautéed shrooms....with French fries & sweet potato fries....they were all enjoyed thoroughly.  We've decided on a return visit, possibly to enjoy some of the entertainment evening scene which includes dueling pianos, paint night, & karaoke! Check the calendar for this month's schedule!"}
{"text":"Friday night fish fry is fantastic! Always cooked perfect and they are happy to bring out the extra orders. Friendly staff, always clean and nice full bar.  Great place... never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I took my two children to this place after visiting an old friend in the area. We were starving. I ordered an appetizer which arrived after our meals, had it sent back, what was the point? I was told the computers backed up, right.....I ordered the noodles with marinara for one child and the chicken strips for the other. I myself, ordered the pecan crusted trout which was a highlighted favorite on the menu. I was really looking forward to it. Took my first bite and just about died. It tats ted like batteries!!!!!!!! The fish was way too thin and still had the skin on it, which could explain the battery taste, absolutely gross. I returned the dish and thank god was not charged for it. The noodles were not so great either, hardly any sauce which tasted like it came out of a jar. The fries were cold in the chicken strip dinner. I will never return this place again. So not worth it. The girl that works the front door was rude as well, no greetings or anything when we walked in. Just an all around bad place."}
{"text":"Terrific neighborhood bar and grill. Relaxing atmosphere with lots of tvs just in time for football season. Loved the juicy chicken fajitas - sizzling, flavorful, fresh."}
{"text":"I had a much better experience this time at Lakeside! The food is typical bar-themed food. I had the Philly cheesesteak and my hubby had a burger - both tasty, fries well cooked. Service was excellent!!! The waiter was attentive and friendly, he checked in often. Service was fast and courteous! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is the place to be!  We have done lunch and dinner here and decided to give breakfast a try.  So it is Mother's Day when we try them.  They were awesome!  Good food, very attentive and they made the experience a good one!  We will be back.  This place gets it!  They should hold a class for other business owners on how to value their customers!"}
{"text":"Very basic bar food. A few fun drinks available. Lots of tv's to watch games and fights and we love the dog patio. Staff is hit or miss."}
{"text":"Went to lakeside last night for UFC 117 (Silva vs. Sonnen). Our friends had gotten there at six and we arrived at 620, by that time the place was pretty full already. My Dad and I sat down the waitress came and took our order shortly after.   We shared the chips and salsa with guacamole, and the fried calamari once again, I couldn't resist it was so good.  came out with lemon slices and a tasty marinara sauce.  I also liked their salsa for the chips and the guacamole was alright. I drank Longboards, my dad Sprite. The waitress was very good about making sure we never saw the bottom of our glasses, all six of us at the table for that matter. Then by 7 the place was packed, i mean full to the brim, our friend made a comment about if the fire marshall came in right now they would shut it down haha. I am thoroughly impressed by the service despite the huge crowds and it was a relatively quiet crowd up until the main event, which I admit even I couldn't keep quiet ha."}
{"text":"Buffalo chicken salad is my fave menu item of all!! Love that they now serve breakfast too! Great ambiance for a low key casual get together with family or friends. All of the staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"Seemed like a nice bar and grill, but the food was disappointing.  I guess if I just wanted to watch TV and have a beer, this would be a good place to do it."}
{"text":"Meh. Third time is NOT a charm. Service is SLOW. Food is nothing special. Ordered The Buffalo Chicken Salad w Blu Cheese. Could not detect any Blu cheese in it and the \"roasted red peppers\" were gross w an odd pickled , jarred taste.   The kids meals are decent sized. It the fries are gross. Came here with my kid as there are few other options for kid friendly, inside seating in the are.   Bottom line? NOT worth a $30 lunch!"}
{"text":"Delicious philly cheese steak sandwich and great service at the bar. Try the Sun Kissed mixed drink."}
{"text":"Last night we were in the mood to give Lakeside Bar another try. Overall it was a much better experience service-wise, except for one significant thing; portion size.   My wife ordered the Lake Shape Salad with the Salmon. I ordered the Sweet Retreat Salad with the Salmon. My wife's portion of Salmon was literally 2 1/2 times the size of what I was served. Mind you, they were both prepared wonderfully, but I was just very disappointed with the portion size. I wish I had identified myself to the manager who offered to \"take care of our dinner\" after my last review. Not wanting to seem like I was looking for a freebie, we just paid and left."}
{"text":"I like Lakeside but I have to take two stars off for all the up charges and some of the food not being that good.    In regards to the up charges, either put it on the menu that you will charge extra for things, or the person taking the order should say there will be a charge for it. I shouldn't have to wait to see my bill to see all the up charges.  When I order the steak sandwich they ask if you want onions and mushrooms.  I say sure and throw some jalapenos on it too.  Then I see the bill and was charged extra.  Just down the street at Tailgaters for example, they say on their menu it will be $.99 extra if you want sauerkraut on the brat or add $.75 for cheese on a burger.   This past time I ordered the fajitas which I really like.  The last time I only received 2 tortillas which is no where close to enough with the amount of meat and vegetables it comes with.  So, I asked to make sure I got more than 2.  She said would 4 be ok, and I said fine.   When I see my bill they charged me extra for those 2 tortillas.  Really? For the price it should come with at least 4 tortillas and jalapenos.  The Steak chimichanga was very bad.  I ordered it to go, and you can see in my picture it was burnt.  It was not even eatable.  The sides were bland.  I know management has told me to reach out when something is bad, but I was already tired and didn't want to deal with it.  I guess it was my fault for not checking it before I left, but when a place is good you don't have to.  I also was not a fan of the fish fry on Friday.  As you can see in another one of my pictures, the fish was burnt.  I had to wait a while to get it replaced.  The next batch was cooked better but it really didn't have much flavor."}
{"text":"Reading all the negative reviews about this place prompted me to write a positive one based on my experiences.   I work close by to this establishment and often go here for happy hour afterwards. The bartenders and staff are always very courteous and prompt. The environment is what you'd expect of a sports bar. Yes, there are some loud patrons from time to time, but what do you honestly expect when you visit a BAR during a major sports event. Lets get real people...  As far as the food goes, I highly recommend the Philly cheese steak sandwich as your entree during normal meals or the chicken quesadilla during their happy hour. Both are incredible for the price. For dessert, COOKIE MONSTER. It's awesome. Be sure to share it though, or you'll more than likely die from a heart attack.   Check this place out. There aren't a lot of good places in Peoria, so support the ones we have!"}
{"text":"Corrine was and awesome waitress.  Food was good. And they had Arrogant Bastard on Tap."}
{"text":"Love this place, great ambiance, everyone has been overly incredibly friendly. Service has been spot on every visit that we have had. Even if you don't have the Arizona Burger, make sure you get your side of the jalapeno jam."}
{"text":"Tasty veggie focaccia, fries were great taste and texture. My sister had the buffalo chicken wrap...just the right amount of heat; sweet potatoe fries also very good. We come down every year for vacation & stay near-by. We will definitely be back. Sports bar vibe with good food."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great atmosphere, tasty food, fast service. Couldn't ask for more when I go to sit, watch a game, and enjoy people around me. It's nice to have a local owned restaurant/bar so caring about their locals and friendly staff. My favorite food item is the tuna melt, by far!! Way to go Lakeside!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour and friendly staff! Draft pints range from $2-$3 on their happy hour from 3pm-7pm! Along with appetizers being $2 off! Try the wings grilled, amazing!"}
{"text":"We stopped for dinner. We had burgers and fries. Asked for the burger to be medium. The waiter said it would be pink all the way through. It wasn't. No pink. And the top part of the bun was hard. Nice mix of food. But probably would not return."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite neighborhood bar good prices great service and management is amazing. Clint always helps out and knows how to run it"}
{"text":"Meh... I went with my family on New Year's Day because it was open.  We are not football people, but this place was packed with somewhat obnoxious fans.  We sat on the patio, which is fairly nice.  We had calamari which was some of the BEST I've ever had.  That was the best part of the meal for all of us.  The menu is diverse and not in a good way.  They could have something special here if they focus on something and make it good.  Service was slow, as other reviews stated.  We didn't get completely ignored, and I'm sure the waitress was busy with football fans, but still not happy with the server.  I'll only be back if I have to!"}
{"text":"Brought my wife here for her Birthday. This is a place that will definitely go on our return list. The food was good not to pricey, had good portions. For a bar this place was nice to eat at."}
{"text":"Used to love this place. Until now. It was ok good and our server, although sweet, was not really great. Sad to see a place go down. Oh well. There are a lot of places to go around here."}
{"text":"For a long time I was afraid to come here because of the mixed reviews. This is a family friendly sort of sports bar kind of place. It sorts of reminds me of the Ground Round Chain but this is a privately owned place. They offer all the fried goodies and cheesy delights most sports bars have and a mixed menu of family type favorites priced very reasonably. I'm not penalizing them as another Yelper did for the Kraft Mac and Cheese on the menu because it is on the kids menu and is a preferred  food to any young child I know. (sadly)  I ordered the pecan crusted trout. It came with the nicest freshest vegetables and the fish was over a mound of mashed potatoes that were rich with lots of sour cream and butter. The spicy mango salsa was delicious and the trout seemed fresh , tasty and was prepared perfect.   My husband ordered the meatloaf made with angus beef. The plate looked very unattractive but the meatloaf was actually very good with fresh torn sandwich bread threw it.  Service was OUTSTANDING!  I note the vegetables and potato in my ($ 14. something) meal from here were better and fresher than from  a $34. meal I had not too long ago. My Yelp review 3-2-13.  3.75 stars rounded up for value and service."}
{"text":"I think this place was a solid 4/5 star sports bar. Food was good, drinks were good, service was good. We will definitely be returning. The pretzels were good, but no where close to the deliciousness of Culinary Dropout. Good happy hour selection, great beer & drink selection as well. Happy hour on Saturday's too!!"}
{"text":"The food is ok, the service is generally pretty good. There drinks are great! Not a bad place!"}
{"text":"Expectations. They get you every time.  OK - for over a hundred bucks for four of us, one who is a 6 year old and two others who are sharing an entree,I expected so much more.  The atmosphere is casual bar and grill, the food is a mishmosh of lots of different things from burgers to fish to pasta, and the bar is the central focal point in the noisy, bustling place. (I am hoping these are not repeat customers, I can't imagine making this a regular stop on my rounds)  But the food is just, well, THERE. My mom and I shared the fish entree (Some nut crusted halibut job), which was bland and uninspiring. We opted for onion rings on the side which were greasy and fell apart when we tried to eat them and wound up being this big pile of skinless onions and cornmeal mush that I didnt want to touch with a ten-foot fork. So we decided to order a new side of mashed potatoes to split, and our waitress brought us each a side of mashed potatoes at four bucks a pop. (It appeared that English WAS out waitresses' first language but since we didn't speak \"Arrowhead-ese\" and pepper our sentences with words like \"whatever\" and \"totally\" she may have been thrown off.)  On a bright note, the mashed potatoes were very good and appeared to be freshly made. Those were the high point of our visit.  Anot her thing I hate about some of these places we try out is that the waitstaff knows very little about the food or beers on tap they are serving and it's a realy crapshoot as to what you are ordering. I know today's girls hate to eat and all that, but seriously folks, when I ask for a recommendation I dont want a blank stare and a shrug! Our server could not tell us whether the beer she was trying to recommend was dark or light. You don't even have to DRINK it to know that - just remember what it looks like!! Also, the glass my beer was served in tasted like windex a little bit. I drained my water glass and poured my beer in there to drink from. God knows I did not want to make any other requests of our server, who up till that time had been confused at least twice by questions or requests we had.  My son's grilled chicken sandwich was competent but a bit dry. My husband had some kind of pasta which he liked because it provided him with the 3000 carbohyrates his body requires each day to run effectively. I tasted it and swore Chef Boyardeee had a hand in that creation. The sauce just tased UNNATURAL and possibly canned.  I don't think we would go back there unless someone else was paying, and then we would stick to burgers. A guy at the table next to us had a burger that LOOKED really good. (After the debacle with our meal it was all I could do not to plop down in the chair next to him and his wife and ask for a bite!!!)"}
{"text":"Love this place atmosphere and food are excellent a great place to watch sports and eat or drink.  We have taken guests here and they loved the nachos. The burgers are juicy and delicious"}
{"text":"After a nice hike, what sounds better than a cold beer.  We waited 20 minutes for them to open and were the first guest there.  The server brought our drinks and took a new group's drink order.  When he returned with their drinks he began to take their order.  As he passed our table we let him know we too were ready to order.  He kept walking right by us and said he couldn't put our order in at the same time because he didn't want to back up the kitchen.    Food was subpar at best.  Sweet potato fries were crispy and flavorless.  Regular fries were crunchy like kettle chips.  Maybe, maybe not be visiting again."}
{"text":"You know, sometimes you just forget where you bought that pair of slacks that fits so good.  And sometimes you forget what an awful experience you had at a restaurant last time.  That's us...so fourth time is a never, ever again.  NEVER!  Friday night...fish and chips.  We love fish and chips!  NEVER, ever again."}
{"text":"This is a nice neighborhood  joint (just happens to me my neighborhood). I love the atmosphere, the people and the location.  The food is so, so...I try and stick with the appetizers, wings, onion rings (all the healthy stuff :P). I am always greeted with smiles and after only a couple times they made me feel like a regular.   Happy hour is from 3pm - 7pm and its always been jam packed.  A good group of people, both young and old.  I try and make a stop here weekly and its def on my list when I have family/friends in town and we want to relax with a few beers and conversation."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here a few times. I have never had a good experience, but for some reason we continue to spend our dinners at Lakeside. I guess you call it Applebee's syndrome; you know it is nasty but you keep coming back.   After last night, however, I will never be back. We went for \"Wacky Wednesday\" which promoted $5 specials. The prices are $6. The portions are so pathetic that I am sure this little promo works out in the restaurant's favor. Less food for more money!  We also ordered the chips and salsa which provided us with a mentally stimulating family discussion: do you taste mold or disinfectant? We never came to a conclusion because we had our waitress take it away as quickly as possible. They were unable to bring us more because the entire batch tasted like that. Homemade salsa my ass.  So Lakeside, you can keep your false promotions, horrible portions, and disgusting salsa.  Good thing the service isn't too horrible or you'd really be in trouble."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place but every time I go here the food is meh and everything is way too fried for my liking. The outside is deceiving; beautiful and more upscale than most restaurants in the area. When you get inside you feel like your eating in an auditorium with a bunch of TVs. Not my style personally. Definitely a restaurant I won't be eating at any time soon."}
{"text":"Am I obligated to write a decent review for a place that puts Kraft Macaroni & Cheese on the menu?   Terrible reviews made me skeptical about the food, Kraft on the menu made me pissed off. Had 2 beers, instead.   Get a quality chef in that joint for fuck's sake. What a shame..."}
{"text":"Came here with the family yesterday for the all you can eat fish fry.  The fish was decent.  The fries a little soggy.  My two littles had a hamburger and chicken tenders and they did enjoy their meals.  The food wasn't the reason for the 3 stars - our waitress was.    She seemed to not really care how we were doing at all.  In fact, she rolled her eyes when I asked for a water (we ordered a beer as well) and rolled her eyes AGAIN when I asked for more tartar sauce.  Maybe that's just her regular face, who knows.  We will try it out again, hopefully with some better customer service next time."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here at least every other week. Service and food is amazing! Try their grilled wings, burgers, club , or meatball sub on Mondays! New favorite local bar! Fun on a date or with a group of friends.   Their water is pretty amazing too"}
{"text":"I am a promo model and every time I have been here the staff has made me so comfortable. The regulars here are pleasant and everyone is so friendly. It is like a big huge family here which brings such great vibes to the business. I have even been here alone on karaoke nights and it is just such a blast! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We finally came here last minute on Thursday Night football. Reviews were mostly good so we decided to go, we, meaning myself, my wife and 2 smaller children 3 and 5. We got an appetizer with fried zucchini, cheese sticks and potatoe skins. We also got the Buffalo sliders.  I thought the food was just under perfect.  The only critique I can give is one of our buns were pretty darn hard. It's weird because the top was nice and soft but the bottom was super hard.  My wife and I kind of laughed and  tried to figure out how that could be. But either way the rest of the food was amazing.  The beer was cold the atmosphere was laid back and very family like. We felt right at home. Matt was our server wearing my favorite wardrobe  (shorts, hat and t-shirt) my kinda place(no BS FLARE PINS here), lol. He was on top of his game though,  I promise. I served back in the day and am very hard to completely please,  but he did. Thanks for the great service Matt. See ya again soon."}
{"text":"It's basically the only bar near my house.  For that reason alone I like it.  It's the place I go when I need a quick escape.  And when I walk in it's almost as if the theme song from cheers starts playing: \"Where everybody knows your naaaame.  And they're always glad you caaaaame\""}
{"text":"This was about my 4th time here.  Poor service.  They gave us someone else's food.  The bloody mary was nothing to write home about.  Food is just fair.  Not going back."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday had the all you can easy fish and chips. It was amazing. I tried the mud shark amber ale. Awesome vibe great location. I recommend the lakeside club with sweet potato fries and a mud shark amber ale"}
{"text":"Service was great, even on a busy night. Food was okay. Nothing to write home about, but above average when it comes to bar food. I don't think the food is intended to be bar food, but it tastes generic like bar food."}
{"text":"A ok sums it up.  Food is not bad but nothing to Yelp about.  Pricing is fair and so is the service.  I know this review is not exciting, neither is Lakeside.  Perhaps if one was in a mood for drinks - this may be a great spot for happy hour.  Otherwise, much of the food tastes like \"grocers freezer\" type aps."}
{"text":"This place always serves up tasty American/pub-style food, with decent service and speed.  The only down-side is they can be pretty noisy because of the sports people yelling at TVs during games, but avoid those times and it's a nice place.  The wings are tasty and there are a few good beers on tap.  One of the few places in the area where you can smoke a cigar on the patio."}
{"text":"Great food at an affordable price! And the friendliest staff in the north west valley!"}
{"text":"So when you walk into this place you are met with a floor to ceiling block wall. To get near the bar you have to walk around the wall.  If you walk to the right you have to pass by the waitress/waiter station where they put their orders is.  If you walk to the left you have to squeeze by the bar station where all the waiters/waitresses are  picking up their drinks from the bar.    Its a big wide open space, which I don't necessarily mind but it is hard to get around all the tables to get anywhere.  We sat outside where there was nice patio furniture.  The down side was there were no TV's which is a must for a bar/grill.    I ordered two different tap beers while I was there and the glasses were warm.  The beer was not cold either.  I moved to a mixed drink, a long island, which is a pretty basic drink.  It was awful. I was able to send it back, without being charged, no questions asked.  I ordered a crown and sprite since they didn't have ginger ale, it was okay.   It tasted more like watered down crown, the balance was off.    For food a member of our party ordered the tackle box which appeared to be a sampler platter of fried appetizers.  It looked basic.  I ordered the chicken nachos.  They were dry and the cheese was cold when we got them.  There were a lot of chips with nothing on them.  The taco chips themselves were okay.  It came with a tiny side of salsa and sour cream which wouldn't have been near enough if all the nachos were actually eaten.  The salsa was actually very good.  The chicken was not shredded it was big cubes.  The chicken was bland and not seasoned and tasted like it was boiled.   The service as great.  We had a big party and the server did a great job of meeting our needs.  We ordered a shot later in the night,  Rumchata and Fireball which actually tasted great.   I will not be returning.  Bar/grill restaurants like this are a dime a dozen.  They have to step up their game and I speculate it was so busy because of the location.  Below average joint gets two stars."}
{"text":"This is not a gastro pub. The food all tastes as if it was previously frozen. The bread was not baked recently and the fries reminded me of my grade school cafeteria fries. They had a live band playing good songs but not very well done. They have a large selection of booze so if your going to drink and look for cougars that are well past their prime, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"We go to lakeside because it's one of the few restaurant/bars in the area. Their buns for their burgers are straight out of the pantry and they don't heat them up. Big pet peeve. My burger is warm and then I have a room temperature bun that I can buy at the store. The burger isn't flavored well but the fries are good! The service is okay. Nothing great but it's a sports grill so I don't expect anything spectacular. Drink selection is pretty good and there's a lot of different stations on tv so you can always find something to watch. Overall. Not bad experience but not worth the price for the food."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! The service was excellent. The silverware was not wiped clean. The draft beer could have been colder. Good audio system. But no sound on TV during the world series game. The men's rest room was dirty."}
{"text":"Shari is fantastic. She was very attentive and friendly. The only concern I had is we were there early on a Friday night, more like late afternoon and tried the fish fry which I have had before and it was fantastic, not so on this visit the fish was dry and hard like it had been sitting around for awhile, very disappointing but the sides were excellent and fresh"}
{"text":"This place was very good about a year ago. Since then they downgraded the quality of their burgers and raised their prices in a huge way. What else can I say... Sorry buts the truth."}
{"text":"Couldn't decide between a 2 or a 3 star so i will give them the benefit of the doubt. We are looking at moving to this area and we have a dog so we decided to give this place a try. Very nice about the dog sitting outside. We didn't realize and forgot being a Bar there would be smoking outside. First guy was smoking pretty heavily by our table but was gone pretty quick. Second guy came out and dug between the cracks of the bricks on a column to pull out what was left of his cigar. He sat down by us and puffed away as the wind blew it on all of us including our 10 year old daughter. So we moved to the other end of the porch. We didn't notice it anymore. Food was very average and the meat from ALL three of our meals was like Jerky. So dry and chewy. We had buffalo chicken salad regular chicken and the Pork. It tasted ok but was like a day old . The mashed and gravy...meh. Veggies were almost raw. Tea and lemonade were good The service from the young man was great It was mid to late afternoon so maybe the main cook was not on yet. Big screen TV's on the porch were a nice touch. Death metal music from outdoor speakers could go...but it quickly changed to Alanis Morissette...wild!"}
{"text":"We used to hang out at this bar/grill all the time because its right down the street.  The fajitas are yummmy but the service sucks.  Let me tell you its expensive!!!  We had some really great food there and the location is convenient but we've had a few problems with the management and staff that we now refuse to frequent this place.  We even been cursed out by their top management for complaining about having a contest that you had to be present to win, they did the drawing and they knew the customer (a regular) that had just left and they called him back to come get his prize.  Of course, the people in our group were upset they did this and only wanted their money back for the contest.  Other people in the bar were upset too.  We were told by one manager if we didn't like it to get the F__K Out.  Yes in those words.  Needless to say that manager got sent home and the replacement manager comped our entire meal/drinks.  So they did the right thing in that case.  Just know when you go here...fair to poor service, good food and VERY expensive!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere for reasonable prices! Great happy hour too. I recommend their chili! Yum"}
{"text":"Horrible food and super slow service for drinks. They always seem to be understaffed and the layout is too cluttered!"}
{"text":"This place was has the best service I have come across on my visit to Phoenix  Got BTN on tv at the drop of a hat.   Dani was awesome"}
{"text":"This place is your typical bar and grill, nothing too exciting. There's a decent amount of choices, again it's stuff to be expected from most places. I got the coconut shrimp and mashed potatoes with gravy. It wasn't bad, but I've had better. I can see it being a good place to watch a game. There are a lot of big Tv's, but the place isn't super loud which is really nice. The best part about going there was the drink I got, it was the Lakeside Lemonade I think, and it was delicious. I definitely recommend that drink. Overall just an average experience, don't expect to be wowed."}
{"text":"Great food and great deals! Me and my lady came to Arizona on a vacation and we ended up at this spot 3 nights out of the 4 we were in Arizona! Great potato skins and quasidillas! There wasn't anything we didn't like!"}
{"text":"Place must be in trouble.  Menus and table flip charts advertise and are clearly printed that happy is Monday through Saturday from 3 - 7 pm.  Server argued that it has changed and would not honor the printed happy hour specials.  Must really need the extra couple of dollars for the last hour.  Food was average at best.  Limes for drink garnish were old and brown.  Last time we come back, but don't expect it to be around much longer."}
{"text":"We have eaten here numerous times and always enjoy sitting on the patio. Today the food was excellent, service was great. Some people brought their dogs and that also is no problem as the dogs were well behaved. The one thing that really bothered us is when one couple fed the dog off the same plates like we were using. The dogs had separate water bowls and it would've been nice if they had their own plate."}
{"text":"This place offers a great atmosphere and food! I always get the meatloaf with gravy and mashed potatoes. It is excellent! I would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a quality meal at a decent price."}
{"text":"Seeing as how this one of the few restaurants in the Peoria area, I feel it is need of some help.  This was our second time going here and neither visit left us satisfied.   We came in a little later in the evening with some family that was in town to visit. There was an MMA fight in the tv so the place was still pretty busy but they told us to grab a table wherever. Our waiter greeted us right away and got some drinks going for us. One of our guests had some food restrictions so we asked for a moment while we looked at the menu. Well, that was a mistake because we needed up waiting about 20 minutes for our waiter to return. By the time he came back, we all had empty glasses.   Finally our food order was out it and everyone got something different. I myself, just ordered a Caesar salad and chili since it was later in the evening and was looking for something on the lighter side. The chili...was cold. For as long as we waited for our food, it should have been HOT! The salad left much to be desired. It had very little dressing and not much else.  I love having a restaurant near us that is not a big chain but they need to work on the menu and service a bit. My husband and I go out to eat on a regular basis and it would be nice to have a great restaurant closer to us so we don't have to travel."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here and we had a good time talking because we waited a while. The staff seemed friendly and a few people asked us how we were doing which we thought was nice. I ordered four street tacos all carne sada  because you cannot get different ones like two chicken and two steak unfortunately. They were good but didn't seem marinated and were a little dry but I did eat them because the salsa they came with was delicious. My husband ordered a chicken Caesar wrap and he said it was delicious. Overall we are willing to try it again and maybe change our rating if we have a better experience but the wait was a little long. Maybe if they gave us chips and salsa while we waited it might've been a little better. Lol"}
{"text":"I just can't keep giving this place another chance after last night's dinner.  Used to be one of our favorite places but it's gone down hill.  I give the manager credit, he reached out to me after my last poor review and sent me a gift card for a free dinner.  My husband and I used it several months ago and our dinner was ok.  Took my sister there last night (first time in probably 6 months) and it was horrible and expensive.  I ordered a cheese burger w no bun and side of veggies instead of fries.  Burger was good (how do you ruin a patty of ground beef) but veggies had no taste so I ate only 1 piece of broccoli.  My sister ordered a pulled pork sandwich and a side of coleslaw.  Her sandwich was so small it wouldn't have filled up a toddler.  Our bill w tip was just over $30.  What a huge waste of money!  We could have gone to Panera Bread for a good meal and half he price.  I'm done!"}
{"text":"Dueling pianos was by far the most fun I've had in a while. Our server was slammed with tables but he did an awesome job keeping the drinks flowing! Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"I visited this bar and grill after my long monday morning shift at a neighboring restaurant and recieved some great service from one of the servers named Becky. She kept my beer cold and full which is always an easy way to keep me happy. Not only that but she gave me a few great recommendations on menu items and i ended up picking one that sbe talked to highly about. She knew her stuff!!! Thanks becky!!"}
{"text":"Just ok at best. Interestingly this place has a dance area of sorts. It was great to accommodate a very large group.  I went here with an entire wedding after party."}
{"text":"Great food in North Peoria. Chicken fajitas are the best! Location often gets busy, especially in the weekends but their food and specials are worth it."}
{"text":"Best service! Sheri was absolutely accommodating! Drinks came quickly-food was hot! A great experience all around!!!"}
{"text":"We use to like coming here, but lately the place has turned into a third world restaurant...nobody really seems to care. The bartender was more interested in talking with a patron than taking our order. Just very annoying after a good five minutes of just sitting there with no acknowledgement. Just another example of a medicore bar and restaurant in this area..ugh."}
{"text":"Took three tries to get my wrap the correct way I ordered it , side of fries was very small but service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Typical American food and bar. Been here a couple of time when I was in the area. Clean place, service is average nothing special. They have a ton of room by the bar and a decent patio. Once again. The food is nothing to get excited about. Typical \"bar food\""}
{"text":"We tried Lakeside after reading a FB post by Upper West Side Phx. What a great recommendation!  Our server recommended the Fajitas. They were amazing! The carrot cake is excellent as well. We enjoyed sitting on the patio that is cooled nicely by misters. We love eating great food at locally owned restaurants and will definitely be back. An added plus is that happy hour goes till 7 PM on Fridays."}
{"text":"Good Burgers, Good Wings, Cold Beer, Nicely portioned shots, 9 outta 10(ones a Guy) waitresses are cute, all your typical bar fixings done well. The non typical menu items are excellent. Fajitas are great but everyone hates you when you order them lol get em anyway! LOL! It sets off a chain reaction! One person gets em, everyone smells em, the orders fly into the kitchen. You leave smelling like the wonderful peppers and onions but damn they're good! I can watch all the sports I want. It is a Bar and Grill that's what you kinda expect by the name. Free UFC, great happy hour. If they had a late night I would stay  later!"}
{"text":"Burger was good. Appetizers were standard but onion rings were good. If u order the salad ask for cheese on the side otherwise u get the whole bag dumped on top. Standard meal fair price need more vegetarian options."}
{"text":"This bar has found its niche in this area as a dependable, affordable, average sportsbar/restaurant. It's menu consists mainly of sandwiches and appetizers. I long for an affordable, casual, trendy restaurant in this area with an inspired menu, but that is not what this bar is going for. It has served me, my friends, my family well for years. Good happy hour and daily deals, trivia, etc. Nice staff."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price! We went during HH and were so jazzed to have an awesome deal on beer and wine with our dinner! Will be bringing more to this place in the future!"}
{"text":"Never have I been subjected to poorer customer service nor had a more pathetic dining experience in my entire life. To begin, the iced tea and water tasted of dirt. The restaurant was hardly busy but it took 53 minutes to get our food and that was AFTER we flagged down a random waitress as ours hadn't been by since we ordered. The new server kindly informed is that our order had never been placed and that we'd have to wait another 15min. I immediately went to the front desk where I waited another 10min to speak with a manager. Teary eyed, she tried to convince me that this was not how Lakeside normally was, that it's a good establishment (looking at the yelp reviews now, it's obvious this is not the case). The food was room temperature, the portion of meat to sandwich was wanting and the service is by far the most pathetic of all. Even with the 75% discount we received on our bill, $19 is not worth the aggravation. I will never return, not even for my usual second chance."}
{"text":"I could decide to go with 3 or 4 stars but to even the other reviews out I rounded up...ha ha.  I think the food is good here, it's not that I have to have it but its decent for the area and its always busy.  I like that it's not a chain and there are specials every day of the week.  I like going Tuesday's for the buy one get one free hamburgers with a friend.  On Thursday's they have free poker where mostly the cheap people show up but there a few normal guys that play.  There were at least 30-35 people playing the one time I went and can you believe I took 2nd place?  Which when it's free means that I get a $15 gift card, woo whoo!  Anyway, I like the decor, the atmosphere and I never had a bad service experience like some other reviewers but then again I don't think of my self as a pain in the ass either."}
{"text":"The beer was good, but the food was not.  Large portion size, but that doesn't make up for poor quality food.  In the end, we left a lot of food on our plates and went home with the opposite of satisfaction.  $60 for two people and subpar food.  Yehaw."}
{"text":"AVOID this place at all costs.  I've never been treated so disrespectful in my entire life.   Came here last night with 3 friends after having dinner at Squid Ink since it's the only bar in the area.  Ordered a beer for myself and 2 of my friends and was promptly told that in order to get the drinks I would need to surrender my keys.  Ok... I told them and I gave them my keys even though I didn't even bring my car here.  My friends and I ordered shots, then went on the dance floor and goofed around having a good time.  When I went to order another drink I was told by the waitress that I was \"too drunk.\"  \"Excuse me?\" I asked her, \"I've had 2 drinks!\"  When I asked for my keys back she just flatly told me, \"No.\" I went to find a manager and a burly doorman asked me what was my \"problem.\" I told him my problem was I was being refused service and I just wanted to get my keys and get out of this crappy bar.  He told me I would get my keys as soon as a cab got here. I told him a cab was on the way, and that never in my life had I been treated like a common criminal for doing nothing wrong!  I told him obviously you people don't want my business and I won't ever return.  That's when the doorman told me, \"That's fine, fags like you aren't welcome here.\" That's when I completely lost my shit.  After the cab arrived I asked for my keys back. I was told, \"you're just planning on taking the cab to your car.\" I told him my car was at home and I needed my keys to get into my house! He finally thew the keys at me and I got the heck out of there.  I have no idea where the people come off treating someone like that.  I did nothing wrong and was called a hateful word and was treated like a common criminal. And my tab came to around $25 for 3 beers. Definitely avoid this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch there today.  Food was not good.  She had a taco salad that was tasteless.  Meat was clearly just a hamburger that was somewhat broken up with no taco seasoning.  I had a Lakeside burger, with onion rings instead of the fries that came with it, for a $.99 upcharge.  Received just 6 rings.  Burger was okay, until I crunched on something.  My wife heard the noise and wondered if it was my tooth.  It wasn't.  With two soft drinks, the bill was over $30.  Not worth it.  Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great place no matter the occasion! We dine here often with and without the kids. The prices ate reasonable, food portions are large and kudos to Franco, the owner as my husband and I have both noticed that the music is adjusted based on time & clientele. This places is always clean with very friendly staff, fast food service, and they are consistent! All you can eat fish fry is awesome as well. If your in the neighborhood and looking for food, skip the franchises in the area ,and give this place a try. I've known this owner for many years, ( he owned & operated a completely different establishment when we first met) and you will definitely leave satisfied with food as service as these are his specialties. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My wife and 4 of her girl friends went there shortly after 1pm today. Waiter took their drink order and then they had to wave him down at least 15 min. later to get him back. It appeared that he forgot them. Then the food didn't come out for at least another 1/2 hour. Two of the orders were incorrect. They offered to redo them, but they said no because they didn't have all day. Service really slow. Food was okay. It's time to update the staff as to the correct way to serve customers."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch while in the area and really enjoyed the food. Service was quick and easy. Great place to stop in for a fun family meal.   We were doing lunch so we split some appetizers, we did nachos and the tackle box, we could have easily done just one or the other but wanted some variety. It was fun bar food type of thing. I was excited because it was easy to option everything to be meat free (not always possible with bar food). No hassle to get it done, and everything was correct when it hit the table.   The kiddo had a kids burger and loved it. One word of warning HUGE portion sizes. I doubt I'd ever come in and not share so get friendly or get ready to take home leftovers."}
{"text":"Nutshell  by Kelly H.  If this place would put as much thought, time and creativity into their food as they did their decor/ambiance, this would be an establishment I could actually eat at.   Ok, I have to say something nice, cuz I just do. I would go here to drink.  I feel better now."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for the past year.  The food is fresh and delicious.  A lot of the recipes are made in house.  The managers and staff are top notch.  They are friendly and the service is great.  The All You Can Eat Fish & Chips on Friday's is fantastic.  Special thanks to Jose, Laura, Krissy, and Margie, and Michelle for making every meal fun and delicious."}
{"text":"Meh. Not bad, not great. Good beer list, lotsa TVs with mult games playing. Solid appetizers but very mediocre meals. Nothing special and def an older AARP crowd (and that's comin from a grandmother's assessment).  Good place to watch a game, have a few brewskies and some munchies. Def not a date destination."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here for over 5 years. Despite the new ownership in the last year or so, the restaurant seems to have retained several of our favorite servers. The wings remain to be the best around. Several draft beers to choose from, which are always cold."}
{"text":"You would think that by the name of this restaurant that it would be near water.  Well it's not, but the decor on the inside tries to emulate a fun beachy sort of atmosphere.  I'm guessing the relative closeness of Lake Pleasant inspired the theme of this restaurant.  The food is similar to what you would expect at a typical sports bar.  Nothing much really to say but lots of fried items.  The prices really don't match the quality of food you get here.  Don't come here looking for a great meal, maybe something to fill your stomach while watching a sports game.  For the area this is a decent place to go watch your favorite sports team as they have many up to date TV's with a wide variety of channels to choose from."}
{"text":"Last Friday arrived at 5:15 ordered Fish and Chips. That's the special so one would assume it's kinda ready. 45 min to get it better not cooked cold dry. Worse fish ever. Been eating it for several years with prior owner. Waitress had shitty attitude also. Never came back to ask if we wanted anything else."}
{"text":"Was very regular here for months, and still think it is a nice little hangout.  About the only thing that drove me \"into the arms of another\" is the food.  It's not bad, it's just very average and it's easy to see there is an abundance of pre-prepared items.  A couple dishes here would bump  to the 4th star, but most need to be rated honestly at 3.  Another thing that prevents me from giving a higher rating is the liquor selection.  The mainline brands are covered, but you won't see much in the premium lines.  In all fairness, that may not be the client Lakeside is looking for, but for me, life is too short to ignore the top shelf.  On the plus side- service is always terrific by the waitstaff.  Management does not present a welcome demeanor though- for as many times as I have visited, rarely spending less than about $80, I never had an encounter with management- if only to ask how things were.  So...plus/minus.  Another plus was the screening of UFC fights.  These nights are where my group would really spend.  The prior paragraph applies here too.  Lakeside could easily improve and noticeably so.  I really think they should ramp things up.  There are new options in the area now, and they may be forced to up their game a bit.  I'd hate to see them close down, though I'm sure the local regulars won't let that happen."}
{"text":"Beachy laid-back vibe.  Husband had a burger that was absolutely delicious.  I had fajitas. They marinate the beef in orange juice and spices.  It was really good but my fajita dish was so hot some of my onions and peppers were absolutely charred by the end (otherwise 4 stars) I like a good char but that was a little much.  Beef was so good though.  The orange flavor was subtle but appreciated.  Good service."}
{"text":"I was super disappointed with this place!  The food was average bar food in an average bar.  They have painting classes though!?!"}
{"text":"Love their food, but on a night that there is an event, the mass confusion experienced with trying to get seated for 2 people while the bar was still half empty was quite frustrating. After waiting 20 minutes, the 3 cute canaries running the hostess station finally seated us. I would recommend some more training and some managerial presence is definitely needed here!"}
{"text":"Sunday late afternoon visit to watch college football and grab some grub.   Ice cold beers A+  Started with the chips and salsa (added guacamole which was well prepared and tasted freshly prepped and not prepackaged)  I had the Arizona Burger - It was phenomenal! Just the right amount of heat and sweetness. Do yourself a favor and TRY IT!  I ordered the sweet potato fries which were also very tasty.   Hubby had the meatloaf and mashed potatoes which he said was really good, tender and very moist. Although he prefers a ketchup/tomato based topping over brown gravy.   Two separate patrons at the bar had fajitas delivered while we were waiting for our food - it smelled delicious! Will be back just to try the fajitas!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since it's opened and I'm still impressed with the consistency and friendly atmosphere.  Our bartender Lori is always smiling and never ceases to amaze me with her knowledge of cocktail concoctions and ability to make them great.  The food always taste well prepared and fresh, never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Kitchen was really running slow. Usually food comes out quickly. Wife ordered Philly cheese steak sandwich with no onion, came out with onion and not hot. I ordered a medium well BBQ burger that came out more like extra well, let's make sure it's dead done! Hope this is not a sign."}
{"text":"Lackluster food. The star is for the atmosphere which is super casual. They have karaoke on Friday evenings which is fun to see locals hang out. I thought it was a nicer place based on the exterior, my expectations were not met."}
{"text":"Went  6/9/17 for lunch with 2 visiting friends and their dog. Initially we were so happy since dog was immediately given a bowl of water as we were seated on the patio.  Wanted to use my 7.99 lunch entree coupon but choices were limited and basically would be the same as the 50% off burger or sandwich coupon which I also had, but I wanted something other than those. Why bother putting coupons out if there are so many restrictions? Isn't the point that potential customers will come in, be happy with a deal, become regulars, spread the word, etc.? Why make it an ordeal or something close to a bait and switch? The special of the day was all you could eat fish for $14.99 so I asked if I could just have a single serving fish with the coupon. No, but I could have a child's portion for $9.99. Now remember that their coupon stated the $7.99 was a $1.00 off of a regular lunch entree, so they are charging a dollar more for a child's portion since they don't classify it as a lunch entree, but I ordered it and my friend ordered it too. Other friend went with the all you can eat for $14.99. When meals arrived we stared in disbelief. The child's portion fish was the size of a chicken wing, the nondescript fries were less than a small McD's, the common tasting coleslaw was about a heaping tablespoon. The fish was excellent with a light batter and succulent and tender white meat. We should've have the friend who had the all-you-can eat meal order more and had him slip some to us, but we're honest. Turns out he wasn't as hungry as he thought so never even asked for another piece so we asked if we could have rolls or another piece of fish to split since we were still hungry and since he wasn't going to order another piece it would equal out. No go. We had even ordered the doggy meatballs for $3.00 and two drinks at $2.79 each. You'd think SOMETHING might have been offered after rejecting both coupons, underserving us with 2 mini-meals that would embarrass McD's (and no cute toy to console us lol). I told the manager we were so disappointed, wasn't there anything he could do--free dessert, price reduction, anything. No. Ironically, friends decided to move to area. Would've been regulars with the first class dog treatment that is so hard to find, but until Lakeside Grill can treat its humans better, they certainly won't be seeing us again."}
{"text":"We say outside; they were doing the piano man and it was obnoxiously loud inside. Our server was Mikala(sp?) Mikala didn't seem like she really wanted to be there.  She wasn't particularly friendly...is a smile too much to ask? Even though she had plenty of room to get around the table she still asked my daughter to pass waters around the table. It was a table of six! Lazy much? Food was \"ok\" My burger was under-cooked. Obviously a frozen patty. The pretzel bites were soaked in oil. My daughter, who order them and has like them in the past, did not eat more than one. Dinner was over but no one cleared any dirty plates from the table. Not. A. Single. One. No refills of drinks were offered. No deserts were offered. But the check was promptly placed in front of me without so much as a thank you. (or even an F you) I payed and tipped barely 15%.  Mikala is lucky she got that. Might be back...most likely not as it appears they want to cater to the bar crowd.  Too bad since we live really close."}
{"text":"Older and dingy. Newer ownership. They don't care about service or how they treat their employees."}
{"text":"If you love craft beer.. you'll LOVE this place! Great brews and great food. All the staff is attentive and friendly! 10/10"}
{"text":"Meat market on the night we went.   A lot of people talking real loud and obvious in the expectations for the night.  I would not go here for a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"We had an amazing server named Taylor! We have been here before and the service was great that time too. The burgers and fries are delicious! If you talk to my family, you'll know that it takes quite a bit for me to say that. The prices are very reasonable. We will be coming here again soon."}
{"text":"As with a previous reviewer, I was also reluctant to try Lakeside Bar & Grill due to the wide range of reviews. I'm happy to say we were pleasantly surprised with our overall experience. Pretty good atmosphere with interesting decor. Pretty consistent with a sports bar atmosphere. The service was very good by our waitstaff. The food was average for what you would expect for a bar & grill. I had the meatloaf which was OK, not outstanding and not terrible. Our daughters shared the turkey/cranberry sandwich and remarked the cranberry sauce tasted like it came out of a can. Overall, they like it and remarked it was like Thanksgiving on a sandwich. My wife had the coconut shrimp and vegetables. She really enjoyed it, but felt it was not homemade but rather frozen and then fried. The beer was good and cold, and the prices were average. We will be back since the overall experience was positive and the location is so close to our house."}
{"text":"Just went here tonight. Never been here before. Curtis was our server.  He was very nice, outgoing, and likes to talk (which I like that in a server). My friend, her mom and sister came with me. We got fried zuchinni. I usually hate fried zucchini, or zucchini at all, but these were delicious.  I had the Philly cheesesteak. My oh my! It was delish. I added the sauteed mushrooms for 99 cents extra...ask for even extra mushrooms though, there was not much on it but I was okay with it. Curtis was more than glad to refill our cups, even when they weren't all the way empty! Did not have an empty cup at all! I got the onion rings as a side and omg! They are amazing. Everything was hot, and fresh.  Of course, I HAD to order dessert! Turtle cheesecake was on the dessert menu, so I ordered that to go. I got home, and my first bite...H.O.L.Y C.O.W! This is the bomb! The toppings had fallen off, but that's okay!  The last thing I noticed was how clean it was, and bar station was clean as well! Of course I can't have any drinks or sit at the bar cause I'm 18, but will keep this place in mind when I turn 21 (: cause I saw they have a large variety of alcohol, they had some Smirnoff too.  Overall, will be back to this place. Not often cause I live in Surprise, but will try to come here whenever I'm in Anthem. Try this place out now!"}
{"text":"\"Pleasant\"-ly surprised.  BBQ Bacon Burger was excellent.  Wife had the chili burger and said it was very good.  My daughter had the Chicken Club.  She's 11 and said it was one of the best sandwiches she's had (in her 11 yrs obviously) and said we need to come back soon.  After a couple weeks of trying other new places and being disappointed, this was a win.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We go here from time to time as we live nearby.  The staff is always very prompt, attentive, and friendly.  My family gets the club and burgers and are happy with them.  I always get the buffalo wrap which I love.  I feel prices are comparable to other same level restaurants.  Nice size patio that is dog friendly and even has a doggie menu"}
{"text":"A great vibe and really caring staff make this a wonderful pit stop. My husband had a burger and it was absolutely the best he has had in a long time. Plump and juicy Meat that was flavorful. A rare find at this price point. Cobb salad was tasty and fresh greens. Plenty of crunch. The wine is an average Merlot that should be chilled a bit. All in all a great place that we will return to. Looking forward to trying the Friday night fishfry. Perhaps we will be able to move from 4 to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"To call this a bar and grill is a stretch. This is a sports bar, nothing more. The noise level is deafening. The food is average at best. The servers are too busy to really pay attention. Did I mention it's noisy? The menu offers nothing outside of the usual sports bar fare. If they have a signature dish, it is well hidden. Couldn't even express our dissatisfaction to the staff, they couldn't hear us either."}
{"text":"Weve been going here since it opened.  Friday nights are ussually busy with happy hour and all you eat fish friday.  Fish is pretty amazing and noone can top the South Ramp Burger-HUGE!! IF you want a monster hamburger-makes a big mac sad :( you want to order this!  IT has awesome blue cheese and is pretty amazing and see IF you can finsih it??  Also, their mash potatoes w/brown gravy is too die for!! I do have to say though the backup guys-will most likely bring your food out instead of your waitress but their friendly and will bring you whatever condiments you need. Yes there is a bar but there are also tables for families to sit at.   A good mom and pop restaurant :)"}
{"text":"I entered incorrect amount for tip by mistake and spoke to manager asking him if he could correct the amount. He mentioned that I have to go to restaurant in person and that he would help me. I went to the place all the way hoping it would be resolved and then they found ways to avoid me and did nothing to correct the amount. If they did not have intention to help me, they shouldn't have asked me to come in person."}
{"text":"Needing one last drink on a Friday night, we grabbed a table...and waited, and waited.  For fifteen minutes we were completely ignored.  We saw waitresses walk back and forth, but by that time (11:30 PM), they were more interested in hanging at tables talking with friends than picking up any new business, even though they were supposed to be open til 2 AM.    Not all was lost - I was still able to enjoy some semi decent tunes before we got the picture and left.  But not early enough to avoid the x rated entertainment.  Apparently some drunk chick mistook a table and chairs as a mattress and some pillows and thought the thing to do was dry hump and try to undress her date.  And she wasn't cute.  Ick."}
{"text":"The hostess at the front desk seated us and we waited 15 minutes with waiters walking right by us and nobody bothered to come to our table! We wanted a few drinks so we moved to the bar and the bartender acted grouchy and not friendly... my husband and I noticed now everyone looked unhappy.  We had bad service another time we came to this place and the food wasn't that good.  The restaurant is cute inside.. nice atmosphere but that's about it!!!!... go to chilis instead"}
{"text":"Maybe some of th best wings I've ever eaten, and coming from NY where chicken wings are very prevalent that's impressive."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going here about once a month since they opened.  We have never ever had bad food or bad service.  We have tried many of the menu item's very very good.  I am not sure what some of these people are talking about.   We were there on Wednesday.  I got a 1/2 lb burger for $6.00.  It was amazing. It can get a tad noisy but it is a sports bar..."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio. I saw 3 tables complain about food. My wife's sandwich was dry as a bone. Expect loud slipknot music outside on loop. Guess it's ok for beers and and sport. Oh they short changed me to."}
{"text":"Waiter was great wife's lunch was good my burger was a little bland which surprised me. We have eaten here many times and it has always been great. Will be back will just switch my selection."}
{"text":"This was just average. First time in this area. this restaurant was recommend.  Pass on The onion rings. Burgers were ok."}
{"text":"I made a special request to reserve a table for 20 for my daughter's graduation dinner. Kat, the manager set up a table for us on the patio, and we had an excellent server - sorry I can't remember her name - and food was good. Price is reasonable and we had a great time.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"New to the area and wasn't impressed. Service was ok but food-average at best. Pretzel bites taste like the ones you purchase in the freezer section at the store. Burger was so so and onion rings-not so good. $43 bucks for a burger, salad, pretzel bites and a beer-not worth it."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times. Service is always great and so is the food. Love the Asian wings!"}
{"text":"Went for their Friday fish fry. Found the fish tasteless and service slow. Cole slaw was good. Was busy so the room was really noisy and claustophobic. Not sure anyone has as many tv's though. May try again some other day and menu item - but maybe not. Average."}
{"text":"In the mood for a tasty burger and beer in a laid back restaurant then stop in to Lakeside. After an all day flight from the east coast, my husband and I wanted a burger and to sit down and enjoy it. Love a lot of red meat in between your buns, follow my husband's lead and get the pastrami burger. He loved it! He thought it might be too much but it hit the spot after a long day of travel. I went with their Just-a-burger and added pepperjack cheese. Grilled just right. I also had a salad, which was ok.  The service was friendly and quick. They have a full bar  and patio dinning if you want to eat outside. You can catch up on your sports for the day. Plenty of screens throughout the restaurant and bar.   If you want to keep your dining experience simple with a traditional American menu I recommend a stop in.  Kitchen closes at 10 on weekends."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was fun.  Smelled like dirty cleaning rags.  Waitress was not friendly.  Food was decent.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday during NFL season - lots of fans cheering for non-AZ teams, mostly snowbirds, so Lions, Steelers, Packers, Vikings etc, plenty of TVs for everyone to watch.  I had some fried zucchini and coconut shrimp, both underwhelming.  The shrimp were a bit overdone, just tossed on a plate with mediocre sauce, and the zucchini was too wet inside, the batter didn't stick to the zucchini slices.  I've been told the burgers are the way to go at Lakeside, so maybe I ordered the wrong thing.  Hope round 2 takes a step up"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best, but the real problem is the management staff. We play trivia at lakeside weekly and after all the issues with trivia and them hosting and not hosting and the hoops you have to jump through to use the winnings, last night is the last time we will ever visit this establishment.  There is absolutely nothing lakeside could do to earn back our weekly tabs of 8+ people.  My advice for anyone wanting a local restaurant go to Haymaker! Way better food and service! If I could give less than one star I would!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour appetizers and beer were decent, especially if you like fried food.  Service was somewhat below average but tolerable.  Staff had no idea what beers were on tap, and the menu had some errors.  Great location with good parking.  Don't know how they can screw things up.  Maybe the location is what keeps them in business."}
{"text":"great food happy to have this near my house instead of driving all the way downtown i have this wonderful place in the neighborhood. ate great food and would recommend this to family and friends. Bar is great to and entertainment"}
{"text":"Always great service! I always get the Just a Burger and fries! Wednesday night its discounted. Fun and exciting environment. Definately recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurants customer service was really nice! I tried the Baked Potato Soup and it was so amazing and very light tasting and not heavy on the stomach. I also had the Chicken Cesar Wrap. I really like the scene and the food. I had an over all great experience and would go again!"}
{"text":"I HIGHLY recommend this place. I have been here a couple of times and had a good experience but there is not a lot on the menu for me as I am a vegetarian. Tonight, I mentioned to our waiter, after ordering only dessert, that they should really get a veggie burger of some sort on the menu. He then mentioned it to the manager who came over and talked to me about what sort of veggie burger I was thinking and then disappeared into the back. Next thing I know he came out with a house made veggie burger patty that the chef whipped up in very little time with what he already had in the kitchen. I have been a vegetarian for 12 years. This is one of THE BEST veggie burgers I have ever had. I, and my parents, gobbled that up quick. Then the chef came out with the manager to talk to me (pretty awesome), get my opinion on it. Two thumbs up for sure! Next they brought out the veggie burger patty with bun and toppings and sauce to see how I thought that was. The sauce was amazing. The way he made it up with all the toppings was amazing. So amazing that I ate the onions, I do not even like onions. Seriously, if you are a vegetarian, or not, ask for this. This is some of the most amazing service I have received at a restaurant ever. The staff is super friendly, the chef is amazing, the food is delicious. What is not to like?!"}
{"text":"Pretty typical sports bar type menu, although pasta and fajitas too.  Food is not bad, but not great. Service has always been great.  It's a good, clean environment, but somewhat small for the type of venues they offer (UFC fights, karaoke, concerts, name that tune). We love the location because there aren't many restaurants out this way. If you are out for a casual decent dinner, this is your place. But nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Lots of potential however lacking in all areas the food ecspecially had the nachos the recipe is something my 6 yearold could make with premade ingredients.  Beer was okay but its tough to mess up a Blue Moon our server Luke was good enough but in reality this place is just ohhhhhhh so blah.  The owners of this place need to care a little almost needs like a restaurant makeover."}
