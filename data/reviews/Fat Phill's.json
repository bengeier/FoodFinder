{"text":"Food was OK...owner likes to order his staff around in front of customers, a bit pompous...overpriced for my likings."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Bob's Burgers (yes, the cartoon).  Sure, the decor is... well, its uniquely artistic, we'll say that.  Sure, the name seems a little off (and he's not even that fat in real life).  Sure, I kind of liked Bigabaldi's, the previous rez in that spot. But...  Service?  Excellent Food?  Excellent Atmosphere?  Reminiscent, and Excellent (once u get used to it)  It's a mom-and-pop burger joint, no question.  But listening to the kitchen, and how Phil speaks to his customers and staff, you get the strong impression of a man happy to be living his dream.  And you can taste it in the food.  High quality levels are maintained all day, and thorough, attentive cooking makes each burger tastes like pure 1950's malt shop gold.  You can customize, and there's a generous selection of sauces (including tzatziki, which I suspect is homemade).  In fact, most of the ingredients taste extra fresh, and their gravy is a must-try.  As long as the local meathead population keeps their distance, this place should become a mainstay and much-needed oasis on \"pizza alley\" (aka Marlee Ave.)"}
{"text":"Great fries....just like from a really great chip wagon!"}
{"text":"Randomly walked by this place and decided to drop in.  What a place! The owner is the nicest person you could encounter and he was offering samples of his homemade soups while you looked at the menu. I ordered a burger and a thai soup and both were excellent. It's refreshing to find a restaurant owner who is all about hospitality! Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Swung by Phil's recently. Heard good things about their homestyle burgers. Overall . . . charcoiled meat-patties were well executed, but, overall burger . . . so-so. Mid-scale burger joints . . . licks, acme, big smoke (craft), goumet burger co, south st. burger, the priest etc. It's all about the details ie bun (toasted), condiments (mayo - wasabi, garlic, chipolte etc). Bacon  (double-smoked). Cheese (aged) etc. That's were phil's fails. Ordered the mushroom-melt and greek tycoon burger. Flavour wise, both were weak. Mr. greek owner . . . head down to the danfourth and take a taste of 'patty and franks'. These peeps are the real deal. They know how to make a r-e-a-l greek style tasting burger. Gobs of feta, fresh tzatsiki etc."}
{"text":"I grew up going to the original Fat Phills, and for years I have been wishing for it to return.  One day while driving along Marlee, I saw the Fat Phills sign get resurrected and I almost cried...was pretty sure I was dreaming!! Literally had to pull over to call all of my family! The place really hasn't changed much, which is no surprise since Phil is still running the joint.  As a kid, I was obsessed with their chicken fingers.  I am now a vegetarian, so I can't comment on that (but I continue to dream about their crispy deliciousness).  However, their veggie burger is wonderful!!! They have tons of toppings to choose from, and the bun is soft and delish! Plus, you can choose from white or whole wheat bun.   The fries deserve their own paragraph.  Hand cut, crispy outside, soft inside...just perfect.  And they have real plum sauce for those, like me, who dip in plum sauce and not ketchup.  I remember when they used to give you those little packages of Wings plum sauce (like what you get when you order a spring roll at a Chinese food restaurant) at their old location and I was happy to see that tradition die.  For the gravy dippers, not to worry...it is wicked. Fresh...not the chunky or powdery kind (blech).  I have also had their Greek salad and it's fantastic.  Great feta cheese (nice portion), and an incredible dressing, which I'm pretty sure is home-made. My only gripe is that I wish they had some healthier side dish options, like a green salad or baked potato (with optional toppings on the side). The greek salad is somewhere between 7-8 dollars, so it's a bit much to get as a side dish (wish it came smaller). I know they call it fat phills, but having the option to be not-so-fat would be good too! And while I'm making wishes, I would like for them to bring back the old school tables that were video games (like pacman).  My dream for Fat Phills to come back to life worked, so I figure I might as well reach for the stars!"}
{"text":"My boy friend and I read a good review on yelp and decided to go try it.  We ordered a big guy burger, a turkey burger, and a poultine,  love it!  The owner there was very nice, he walked by after we finished our meal and offered us free ice-cream!  It's not any fancy place but the experience was so nice, we would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and saw Fat Phill's, so I popped in for a bite.  I got a Little Guy and fries with gravy.   The burger was pretty good. A little more pink than I like it, but it had a nice flavour. Pickles were great.  The French fries are to die for. Fresh cut Russets deep fried... Like a good old fashioned chip truck. Their gravy was fantastic too.  When I ordered from Phill (who isn't actually fat), he made some jokes and saw it was my first time there. He offered me free ice cream for dessert. It was so good.   A little out of my area, but if I lived near I'd definitely be back."}
{"text":"Remarkably friendly service.  Burgers were tasty but the patties were not on the same level as five guys or burger priest (they were cooked all the way through and are a bit dry)."}
{"text":"Nice service, considered it's a plain decor burger joint.  I had a Greek Tycoon Burger.   It was a bit salty. Will go back to try something else next time when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Big selections of toppings and Greek influenced fusion. Place looks rundown and can use some good cleaning and renovation. The burgers are only ok because of the toppings, remove toppings and burger meat is over cocked and lack taste! Obviously, those who liked this place or have it high review; compare it to fast food franchises like Burger King and McDonalds. Not comparable to gourmet burger joints such at Burger Priest or Holy Chuck!"}
{"text":"Comparable to Burger Shack, but with several signature burgers. Thick 7oz patties with crispy bacons with homemade taste. Poutine came with better gravy than Burger Shack but soggy fries. Earned one more star than Burger Shack for more menu choices and service. The owner came by to check on every customer to see if everything was ok. A small detail, but it shows he cares about the quality of his products and customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"One of the best burger I've had in a while. Met the owner while I was there and he seemed to really take pride in his food. He even offered everyone in line free fries and gravy. The gravy tasted great and the fries were reminiscent of a classic chip truck.  Fat Phill's is a must try if you're in the Yonge and Davisville area."}
{"text":"This place is what you call a hidden gem.  A gem hidden in plain sight too!  I must have walked passed this place a hundred times without thinking of going in.  I must have chosen sushi, Subway, or Pizza Pizza next door a hundred times too without giving Fat Phil's a second thought.  The reasons could be the unassuming name, the fact that the previous restaurants before it never took off, who knows.  Or, maybe it's the name itself and how nowadays healthy food has become what we're all striving towards eating.  Whatever the case is, I caved in and tried out Phil's because I was too lazy that day to travel anywhere to get something good.  Boy, was I glad I did!  This restaurant is now my go-to comfort food joint in the Yonge/Davisville area.  The menu is expansive and includes creative versions of the standard burger and fries.  Phil himself is very personable and doesn't hesitate to make you feel welcome in his restaurant.  The other staff members were quite friendly as well.  Some might call the decor 'tacky', but not this reviewer.  I think plastic dinosaurs sitting on the table next to the condiments adds a much appreciated character to the place.  The food itself is awesome, specifically the burgers.  The fries were just ok, but fries are rarely phenomenal anywhere you go.  The deliciousness of the burgers, the personality of Phil and crew, and the reasonable prices more than make up for any detractions as far as I can see.  This is a place I'll be coming back to again and again when I'm too lazy to cook, although i have to watch that because eating here too often will make you a Fat Phil, no matter what your real name is!"}
{"text":"What a disaster. Twenty minutes to get an order of onion rings  The owner is so drunk he can barely stand up and keeps forgetting everyone's order.  It's 11:30 in the morning, by the way.  Two customers have demanded refunds and sent back their food in the short time I've been here.  Gravy is good though."}
{"text":"The Davisville location is spacious and moderately clean. Decor is a bit tacky but I guess it adds some character. Service by the only employee (cook, cashier, etc) was good. He was friendly. Where as the owner just stood there on his phone - which made me feel a bit uncomfortable?  The prices are okay. Ordered the 1/2lb wings and fries for $7.50. Suicide wings were hardly suicide... I wouldn't even say it was mildly hot at all. The fries were more disappointing. They were dark, and tasted or felt stale. I think they probably fried it some time before and refried it for my order...  I'll only come back for desperate times as it is fairly close to where I live."}
{"text":"Great all beef hot dog, with good quality bun.   Good size, didn't think I could eat it all but it was very tasty and I finished it!   Nice people.   I like that they don't use pork.    Milkshake was a bit thin.  The place is not much to look at from the outside but well worth a visit for food quality.   If I worked near here I would probably stop in regularly."}
{"text":"So let's start with the good...  Fat Phil's has some of the friendliest outgoing staff that really makes an effort to make everyone feel comfortable, whether it be making jokes or simply greeting you despite having a long line up of people ahead of you.  The burgers are made with meat in-house a large variety of toppings that you generally have to pay extra for at other gourmet burger places. The original burger choices (Any time you can add Pineapple to a burger you do it!) are outstanding and they offer a ton of greek food choices as well.   So the not so good...  Not a heck of a lot of room to eat a meal with a group of more than two or three people, additionally the fries (2.50 no size choice) are reminiscent of a happy meal sized small fries, which left me disappointed.   Utlamtiely I was happy enough with the burger but the side order left me feeling a bit....frustrated to say the least"}
{"text":"I was stranded on Marlee Ave. with nothing to do for an hour and an empty stomach, so I decided to walk in to Fat Phill's.  Low and behold: Phill isn't actually fat. However, he can whip up some mean burgers. The burgers were above-average quality for the price, and the place offers a very wide range of condiments. Not the absolute best burger I've ever eaten, but it'll do if you're in the area and you're hungry.  The place also has souvlaki, ice cream, and other miscellaneous foods, but I haven't had the chance to try them yet. Maybe you should. Who knows? You might be surprised."}
{"text":"Marlee Ave Fat Phil's is the worst for it's food, serves and cleanliness charges more money them the other locations, burgers are horrible and dry and will charge u $0.50 extra for tomatoes and a few times the lady putting the food together would put it in her pocket, there was garbage all over the tables and none of the staff had hats or hair nets on.... Disgusting place on Marlee Ave, Toronto"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers. You can tell they take this seriously and passionately as they tell you all they have to offer, and they offer quite a bit. Lots of bang for your buck.   The bread is great and more importantly the quality of the meet is really good.   We had the Swiss Melt and the Big Guy with a side of poutine and all three items were absolutely solid choices.   Watch out for the slippery floor ;)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Gourmet burgers for a great price, lots of other eats too including homemade soups and chilli. Great staff. Always satisfied."}
{"text":"Great food, love the chicken breast sandwiches and the fries are homemade.  Prices are a bit on the high side, but worth the once-in-a-while treat!"}
{"text":"Good burger joint! A lot of young kids working here and often see fresh faces every time I came here (been here about 4 times)  The poutine is good- I like the gravy I'm trying to remember the onion rings that my boyfriend ordered, he liked them I only tried 1 but they were decent Good burger, could be juicier if the grill guy didn't press down on the burger with the spatula and let all the juices out (big NO NO, don't you hate when they do that?)  I wish the toppings looks fresher but still great. I like this place and I will be back. Not the best burger joint around but it's a 3 min walk from my building so can't go wrong. I wish there was a commitment with staff so the place could thrive."}
{"text":"I was around the area and was looking for a fast lunch found this place on a phone search. Checked Yelp and they had some nice things to say so over I went. Their is not really any parking found a spot and went in. Place was busy but very clean. I greeted by the manager/ owner as soon as I walked in like I had known him for years. After taking a few mins to look at the menu I went with the 4oz mushroom Swiss and the jalapeño poppers and came to under $12. The burger was cooked perfect lots of flavour the poppers we're probably the best I have ever had only down side their was only 3 of them. I will definitely be returning to this little gem next time I am in the area"}
{"text":"Nice staff.  I like that they have things other than beef burgers on the menu eg. Pulled pork, chicken breast, ground turkey.  I ordered the Greek tycoon and asked for a turkey burger instead of the beef.  Good burger but I now know why most places don't carry turkey patties - the burger went from $6.50 to $9.50...for a 4oz patty..ouch.  Considering there is a place down the street that literally grounds steak patties in front of you and offers a double cheeseburger with bacon on it for the same price, I'm not sure I could return."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places for quick bite in the area. Phill's has a pretty big menu and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"While ordering, the owner Phil came up and chatted it up with me. Very friendly guy was talking to everyone and staff provide amazing service.   Had the Chicken Souvlaki on a bun.  was quite delicious. The texture of the bun was soft like my buns. And the chicken was juicy and tender like my thighs. Overall great experience for a quick take-out style joint.   Hard to find a places where the owner is so friendly."}
{"text":"I just learned they have closed. I am so upset I love this place and all the people who work here. Talking to Phill when I came in was always a highlight. Best of luck in your future endeavours and please let me know if you pop up ANYWHERE in Toronto. I will be there.  Love, Katie"}
