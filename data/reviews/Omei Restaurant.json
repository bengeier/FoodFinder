{"text":"I only come here for the lobster and yiu have to have a small army to join you.   It can be very expensive.    Cook it 4 ways  (3 up to 6 depending on weight)    Steed claws with garlic  and scallios/Vermiceill  noodles  Stir fry tail with maggie Sauce   Deep fries Lobster legs woth chilli   Stir fried rice with the tomally    Nice overall lobster dish.     The best town and I eat a lot of lobsters  (minimum one per week all summmer long)    The other dish was   Spicy egg plant    average taste and a little oily for me   O mei spicy  beef    again average    I only cone here foe the lobster and nothing else."}
{"text":"The setting is fine, the price is steep though. I went to this place for lunch and this restaurant is comparably expensive. The quality is ok and I would say this restaurant is an ok alternative  when you are tired of always visiting only one or two Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Even better than the seafood restaurants in Hong Kong. You can have 4 different kinds of lobster plate with fried rice. Don't forget to take a picture with gigantic lobster! You will see many people hold it for a photo shooting. Do not miss the Hong Kong style dessert served after the main course even if you are already full :)"}
{"text":"The setting was not so appealing, noisy and a bit dirty and out dated. All the paper containers are stacked up beside a table. Most of the tables are for big group.   The menu is only in Chinese! The food is okay, but the wanton soup was awful! The price is way higher than expected.  I am not going to go there any more. There are lot of other nice Chinese restaurants close by!"}
{"text":"Since it was Chrismas, my family and I decided to come to OMEI and splurge our money on the seafood here. We ended up getting our all-time favourite dish which was the lobster. I'm starting to believe that the farther i drive, the better the food quality is because the lobster we got was about 5 pounds! (VERY BIG!). Since our table was very small, we only decided to get our lobster cooked 2 ways which was the steamed claws in scallion with clear vermicelli and the rest sauteed in onions and soy sauce. The meat was very soft and not dry (perfectly cooked).  We also tried OMEI's very popular and famous 'Buddha Jumping Over Wall' Soup which goes for about $34 per urn! Yes, it was a major wallet burn for me but the soup was very rich in taste and hearty as it was filled with  bamboo shoots, scallops, sea cucumber, abalone, shark fin, ginseng and mushrooms.This dish is suppose to be a Chinese delicacy as it uses high-quality ingredients and when eaten, it is healthy and good for the body! (pretty cool!) We also ordered a special 'flat fish' that was steamed in soy sauce which had very unique flavour and texture to it. Definetly something different from the other Chinese restaurants I've tried.  The only thing I've noticed about their dishes were that all of them were just a tad bit salty but other than that I think the food would have been fine (I just drank ALOT of water).  Overall ambience was clean and decent. Service was attentive. I'll probably only come here next time for the famous soup though, everything else was good but just a bit pricer for what you get. PS. the desserts here are GREAT! NOT Red Bean Soup for once! Instead they give you a great Purple Rice Pudding and Mango Moochi!  yumm!"}
{"text":"I saw a lot of great looking food being served at this restaurant. The problem is, none of it appeared on the menu I was given. No lobster, no crab, no geoduck, even though there were tanks of those items clearly visible. Purely because I am Caucasian, I was given a menu of standard Chinese - Canadian items. I ordered a seabass hotpot, and my wife ordered the tiger prawns. What I got was a stirfried fish filet with onions and mushrooms - how exactly is that supposed to be hot and spicy? I ordered a spicy broccoli, expecting the kai lan I saw other guests eating. Instead, I got something that had a vaguely sweet sour sauce on it.  I lived in the Argyle (primarily Vietnamese) neighborhood of Chicago for 15 years. I have spent about five years of my life in relationships with Asian women. I understand Asian foods. I love Asian cuisines. What I was served was not what I ordered, but a blatantly racist interpretation of what the ownership and servers felt someone who \"looked like me\" would want.  Shame on you Omei."}
{"text":"In my old memory, Omei was just another chopsui Chinese restaurant in many years. This time, my brother-in-law was in town and someone suggested to go Chinese food and picked this place. After sat down, looked around, not fancy, just about the same. Just before we opened the menu, the owner/maitre'd came and started to push their \"special\" king crab and lobster. Seemed like he did not want us to read the menu (order any cheaper dish). Eventually we ordered a king crab 4 or 5 course which I dont remember, plus 2 other dishes. The food was OK! But the price? I was not impressed. You can have a much better Chinese dinner any where in GTA nowaday! I especially dislike the up sale technic."}
{"text":"Friends, Sholom and Erminia have been eating at O MEI's for years... and I finally went with them. Glad that I did.  It's a hidden gem in Richmond Hill. Fresh food, wide variety of each type of dish... I love shrimp and they did it great justice... it was delicious. Can't wait to go back.  Portions are very large. Great prices.   Only comment... the tables are VERY close together."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed. I have ordered delivery 2x from this location and both times I was not impressed with the food quality, portion, or cost. Grossly overpriced. I was craving hot and sour soup so I ordered a large. It was over $10 and I can honestly say it was the most awful soup I've ever had. Fake cartaligey mushrooms that ruined the entire dish and fatty pork... Overload of tofu that had a nasty texture. I can't say anything good about the soup to be honest!!  I also ordered boiled meat dumplings (10) per order and they were large nicely seasoned and delicious. You have to order $20 before tax to qualify for delivery so I ordered these.  I'm so sad the soup was this disappointing because that's the main reason I ordered delivery from here.   Overall I would say skip unless you are dining in for seafood dishes. :("}
{"text":"So we went to OMEI restaurant on Highway 7 after hearing lots of good things about this place. Went in around 5pm, no customers. Got seated for 2 people in total. Got our menu in both english and chinese. Manager came to us and said you want to eat crab? We told him, we will be ordering from the english menu since we can't read chinese........after 5mins, we made our order from the english menu, the manager said.....don't order from the english menu as it is for white people, eat the crab 4 course meal, recommended for TWO people......so we went with the flow and agreed. Afterwards, he brought out a Alaskan crab and said if this one is ok, we nodded. So the food came out, 2 big plates of crab legs and sorts, 1 big plate of fried crabs and 1 plate of fried rice with crab meat......we noticed that this was way too much food for only 2 of us, this is more for 4-6 people. Anyways, bill came, $388!!!!!!!!!! Not including taxes or tips. So I complained to the manager saying that why would he recommend a group meal fit for 4-6 people when we only have TWO people.....he said sorry, and willing to give me a discount, tax free. I paid with 10% tips, since it wasn't the waiters fault. Total damage was $426 down the drain. Yea I know, was my fault as well for not asking the price in the beginning........but, cmon! Recommending a 4 course meal for 2 people and turning out to be a feast for a group of people....that is just shady business."}
{"text":"This place has become our family go-to seafood restaurant for big family dinners.  Would definitely suggest going with a large group and ordering the Alaskan King Crab and Lobster.  This place is great as they allow you to prepare the seafood in multiple ways without extra charge (unlike Fisherman Lobster Clubhouse) The crab prepared steamed with vermicelli is absolutely delicious, but then you can ask for some of it to be prepped with steamed egg whites.  Additionally, the fried egg yolk preparation for both the lobster and crab definitely satisfies that greasy fried craving.   Make sure that you get the steamed egg white with crab- it is one of the highlights of the meal.  The egg is so light and delicious- mix it in with some lobster roe fried rice and you'll 3 bowls later that you may need to be wheeled home."}
{"text":"Came here twice; would not return.  For both visits, we got the lobster 4-way combo.  1st visit: upsold us (3 people) an 8 lb lobster, was told there wasn't a smaller lobster available.  Half an hour later, a couple sat next to our table got a 4 lb lobster.  Guess they had a special shipment flown in right after we ordered.  The food was delicious, but way too much for 3 people, we had a lot of leftover to doggie bag.  2nd visit:  we insisted on a smaller lobster and got it this time around.  The food was not as good as the first time.  The steamed lobster was drowning in cooking wine and was lukewarm.  The other dishes just weren't as tasty as our first visit.  The speed that the dishes came out were faster than last time; it felt rushed.  Verdict: wouldn't pay the price O Mei is charging for inconsistent food."}
{"text":"I was a regular at this restaurant growing up as it was one of my family's favorites many years ago when it was at another location.  A few months ago we visited this location and were totally disappointed.  The service was rushed and impersonal and the food just awful.  We thought it was a one time thing and decided to return today for lunch.  We ordered 2 dishes, noodles and sweet and sour shrimp.  The shrimp came and was heavily battered and the sauce was separate.  The batter was so overwhelming and the shrimp tasted like nothing, maybe previously frozen.  The vegetables that came with the dish were raw (peppers and onions) and the pineapple was canned!!  The noodles were was beyond tasteless and was barely edible.  We will definitely not be returning and I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Extremely good - plenty of food for the price. The decor is pretty nice but you can tell it's aging. Our waiter was pretty funny. I will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"I went there once when i was on a trip in toronto. We had the lobster 4 ways. it was exellent! Best lobster i ever ate. The service was great too. they offered us free deserts at the end of our meal ! Will return here when i come back !"}
{"text":"I took 2 friends from US to this place on a Sunday night for lobster, but ended up having a king crab cooked in 4 ways.  I think the food itself tasted all right, but not impressing!  After we got the check, $500 for 4 people???  Are you kidding me???  What a rip off!!!  I will never go back or recommend it to any friend."}
{"text":"There has been many seafood restaurants opening up lately in the york region but I assure you Omei keeps it old school traditional which makes it hard to duplicate. Menu a bit on the pricey side but for the fresh Quality seafood its worth it!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday mid-autumn festival, and it was madness.  Good thing we had reservations because the place was packed.  Setting - typical Chinese joint.  Tables were cramped, and placed in every nook and cranny you could possibly think of.  I'm sure they are breaking some fire codes here, and I would hate to see what happens when fire Marshal Bill comes in?   The menus were in chinese? Not sure if they have English menus. No problem, our Dad was the only would that could read it, but indecisive as heck.  Finally decided to order lobsters 4 days, with crispy sweet and sour pork, and a side of choy.  Food -   Lobster green onion and glass noodle. Delicious, but did not have the umami factor to me? Maybe they with held the MSG!  Lobster maggi.  Again okay, nothing to write home about?  Lobster pepper salt style?  The flavour was awesome, and mainly because I'm a salty kind of a guy.  It had a hint of heat, but nothing over bearing, and to the point where you're sitting on the john, regretting it the next day. However, this preparation was the hardest to eat, because the cut of lobster meat they used.  It was not as easy as the other preps where you can just scoop the meat out in one foul swoop!  Lobster fried rice. Aka lobster poo fried rice.  Not enough lobster poo in that rice and they almost forgot to give to us. We had to ask for it!  The lobster poo wasn't crispy, you have to fry that poo up so it crunches in your mouth! This lobster poo does not compare to Fishermen clubhouse. Go there for the poo. However they give you generous amounts of pork floss.   Crispy sweet and sour pork(su-yok).  Probably one of the best, if not the best I've had! I'm not usually a fan of sweet and sour but I would definitely order this again.  The food was decent overall with ups and downs. The price to umami ratio do not match up, and I have to give it a decent rating, but not a great rating... Also the service... we'll typical chinese restaurant service, and you can be the judge of that.  Joe"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 3 looking to try the lobster dinner. When we arrived, we were a bit discouraged, as most of the workers didn't speak english, and supposedly only the \"good food\" is on the chinese menus...   However we asked for an english speaking server, and was able to order the lobster dinner we were looking for.  (Lobster 4 ways dinner : steamed, fried with maggie sauce?, spicy fried, fried rice style) + desserts.  Obviously it was too much food for a party of 3, however the meal IS on the pricey side (well it is lobster of course!). I would suggest a party of 5 or more, to help split the bill, and depending on how much lobster you'd like to eat per person ;)  PROS: The lobster was HUGEEEE!! very meaty and delicious in all the various methods that it was cooked. Our favorite was the fried lobster with maggie sauce. The lobsters were cut into decent sized pieces, so the big chunks of meat came out easily to eat! (We definitely enjoy our meals more when there's less work involved trying to get the meat pieces out.) We had lots of leftovers which still tasted great the next day.   After our meal, we were served complimentary desserts: Red bean soup, Mochi balls (with sesame/peanut filling?), mango mochis (AMAZINGG!!), we asked the server how much the mango mochi balls cost, and they asked us how many we would want? asked for 6 more balls, and they gave us more for free! (I guess after spending almost $300 on the meal, giving out a few extra dessert balls is nothing for them).  To be honest, the service was actually really good for a chinese restaurant, maybe its because if the super expensive meal we ordered.   CONS: expensive meal, messy to eat some of the dishes  But overall had a good experience there, would only go back with a larger group of people, or for a very very special occasion."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a family gathering at the restaurant.  The dim sum was good, better than our expectation.  We hesitated before we went there after we checked previous reviews here. Eventually we still want to give it a try. Although the restaurant is not decorated as super fancy or high-end environment, quality food + good services + good price are our concerns.    The restaurant is able to \"custom-make\" and accommodate different dishes for us because we have different food allergies in our family. :)"}
{"text":"Delicious! Order the lobster, cooked four ways. Bring the family, since it will certainly be a large and decadent meal for sharing. One of the best meals I've had in the GTA. I'm waiting for a special occasion to go back."}
{"text":"Average food quality, bad service. it was a really busy Saturday and it wasn't easy to get a server to take our order and unfortunately our server was also forgetful - didn't put in our dinner order and we waited for 30 minutes before another server showed up and asked if we have ordered yet. Finally the food came - food was quite tasty but very greasy. and when we finished we have to ask for three different servers to get our bill. I'm  really not that impressed and will not come back in the future. For that price there are better Chinese restaurants who serve better (and healthier) Chinese food."}
{"text":"My family and I love to go here for lobster. We have it cooked up to 5 ways and it is delicious! Decor isn't that nice, a bit crowded and on the expensive side, but we are never disappointed with the quality of food and service.   The lobster yee-mein is to DIE for"}
{"text":"A seafood convert!  I didn't have much expectations when I came here since I am not big on seafood and this place has made me a convert.  We were here for my girlfriend's father's birthday and the service and food was exceptional.  We ordered the lobster cooked 4 ways (steamed, deep fried, stir fried and in fried rice) and they were all great.  There are 6 of us, so the lobster that we got was pretty massive and at the end of the day, it was roughly $400 for 6 adults.  Comes with 4 types of desserts that you can get more of and we also ordered two additional dishes (they weren't necessary).  The service was top notch.  The server noticed that we were passing around a birthday card and asked if there was a birthday and at the end of the meal, the servers got together and sang a song for us and gave us traditional Chinese birthday buns for free.  The server also noticed that we didn't get one of the desserts and quickly went to the back and got some fresh ones for us (they were deep frying them at the time).  I wouldn't hesitate returning here for a seafood meal."}
{"text":"Scams !!!!!   The meal has a lot MSG.  Show us a king crab at the table said is 8lb only he knows if it is true. The dishes came look a lot smaller in portion.   The carb they show us is different than the one we ate.  $520 for this meal.  Don't go to this place!!!"}
{"text":"This is a place for feast!  Especially such as lobster, king crabs or fishes.  I've had couple excellent seafood feast back in some NYC highend restuarants.  However, I must say the lobster I had here was the best in all honest.  I  do not speak Chinese but my boyfried was greeted by the boss and everything was ordered within a few words of greeting.  He seems very personable and all the customers love him.  We had a \"Buddha jumps over the wall\" soup.  I am not a fan because it is too rich for my taste.  It does seem to grew on me every sip I took.  Given time for enough try, I might love it.  I do understand that it is an expensive soup with many seafood, herb, chicken ingredients and brewing for a long time.  The lobster 4 ways feast.  It was such a big production!  The waiter show me a huge live lobster first and I almost freaked out.  I control myself very well without offending my man. It was a close call though.  The first plate was my favorite by far and the best I have ever had.  Steamed lobster.  So fresh, so tasty, so bouncy, so juicy.  The most amazing part was the clear noodles under the lobster.  The noodle has absorbed all the taste and I could not stop.  The second and third was fry lobster and fried lobster with salt and pepper.  They were good but not as amazing as the first plate.  The final plate was lobster fried rice.  It was pretty good too.  The place was definitely a bit too pricey for my preference.  I would prefer a more high end setup and quieter amostphere for such price.  That is the reason I rated it 4 stars.  However, the food and service totally was deally excellent."}
{"text":"Review of weekend Dim Sum.  Been here quite a few times. Very good, quick service, friendly staff.  Prices are not cheap though. You order off the paper/carbon menu thingy - no carts."}
{"text":"Their Alaskan king crab or lobster cooked 4-way (for large groups) are the best. They have a wide selection of dim sum too."}
{"text":"O me Omei, I love me some Omei.  This is one place that is definitely worth the trip waaaayyyyyyy north of Bloor for. My family and I are regulars here, and for good reason: the seafood selection is outstanding, the dishes are fresh and flavourful, and service is wonderfully attentive.   Omei is perhaps best known for their lobster dishes, and for those seeking to enter the realm of lobster-sans-butter, it don't get better than this. On our most recent visit, we went with a 9 lb. lobster that they first bring out on a massive tray, live. It's always a reason for people to bust out their camera phones and also reminds you just how fresh the seafood is. The next time we see the big guy, he's done up 4 ways: (1)  cut up \"oyster\" style with thin strips of green onion, (2) cooked up in a wok - or pan - in a more traditional Chinese style with the dressings (3) deep fried in batter with crispy chilies and noodle crisps - my fave, and (4) fried rice made with the delicious green \"brains\" of the lobster.   On the side, we had a piping hot bowl of brothy soup on a gas stove made with a whole fish, veggies, tofu, and beef strips (for the vegetarian in our clan, we ordered an all vegetarian soup), and we also indulged in some traditional white chicken with glistening bok choy on the side.  The fun doesn't stop here though - their desserts keep the party rolling. A choice of 2 dessert soups (no basic red bean to be seen here!) is served up with a plate of mini mochi balls stuffed with sesame, and another plate of delicious mango mochi-esque creations rolled in coconut. 'Cause we were there a birthday, they also went ahead and steamed a plate of traditional celebratory buns, served up with an enthusiastic English and Chinese rendition of 'Happy Birthday'.  The damage? For the 6 of us it worked out to about $50 per person with tax and tip, and we were stuffed, even 2 hours later.   Get here. Early if you can (on weekends its a full house by 7:30pm). You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If 50% is average the food is 70% Price - kinda expensive  Service - below average  Food come out very fast but the server was very pushy ( was trying so hard to sell the king crab to us , even we only have 2 ppl )"}
{"text":"When the owner changes hand, the new owner establishes this restaurant to be a seafood restaurant.   This is not a normal Chinese seafood restaurant.  We order an Alaska King crab larger than my body.  It is shown to us that it is still alive and fresh.  It then becomes 3 courses.  The smaller legs are steamed with garlic and green onion.  The larger legs are steamed with another sauce.  The legs are each cut into halves for easy consumption.  The body and the claws are cooked with deep fried garlic.  Another gigantic lobster is shown to us I bet is more than 12 lbs.  It is deep fried with vermicelli noodles at the bottom.  All these seafood is fresh, fresh, fresh!  In order to accompany all these seafood, we order the rest of the dishes to be light like tofu and vegetables.  The dessert has the 2 dishes of pastries like in a wedding banquet, another bowl of sweet dumplings with black sesame,  then the red bean soup and the deep fried egg white Chinese soufflé with white sugar.  The dessert is as yummy as the seafood.  The owner always mingles with the customers well.  The service - ah we are too busy eating!  The food is one of a kind.  It is a must try seafood restaurant if you have not done so."}
{"text":"Yes. You get the huge lobster and fish. But they use way too much msg. I got so sick from the msg after the meal. Also, is it ethical eating a 50 years old lobster?"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with my wife.  The food is generally of good quality.  We really love the spot prawns which are cooked live to order.  The two things that have soured me on this place is that twice the steamed fish has been served underdone....the meat does not come off the bone.  Also, my wife found a push pin (for cork boards) in the food"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for all things seafood. Had dinner with my relatives today and ordered the Alaskan king crab 4 ways, steamed clams, sweet and sour pork, steamed Seabass and king oyster mushrooms on snow pea leaves. I can't get enough of the steamed Alaskan king crab on a bed of Chinese vermicelli, garlic and fresh green onions!! The crab meat is so soft, delicate and, dare I say, sweet. The fried battered crab dish was also delicious - batter was light, crispy and flavourful. All the other dishes were great too, all staple dishes when we visit Omei.   I'd have to agree with all the other reviewers about the desserts at the end. Mango mochi, taro and sago sweet soup and black sesame glutinous rice balls - so good! It's like a second meal in itself but just for the sweet tooth! This place is definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a good seafood meal to share with fam/friends."}
{"text":"It's all about the lobster 4 ways.  You need to order one that's at least 6+ lbs in order for them to be able to make it 4 ways.  Other seafood dishes are well done too, standard red meat and poultry dishes.  Also very good soups and 3+ desserts if you get the lobster.  Rivals the best that Vancouver and even HK can offer."}
{"text":"My favourite lobster place so far! It beats Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant anytime. I just love how many different ways they cook the lobster as it is my favourite seafood. Got the 4 dish lobster combo and it was well worth the price and wait and very filling as well. They also have great dessert to end the meal. Will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"I had to see what the hype was about - and like my fellow Yelpers have mentioned, the lobster is no joke. It is very expensive, the lobsters are huge, and maybe slightly overrated, but damn the lobster dinners are definitely up there.  Service was good and attentive. They replace your shell-filled dishes several times throughout dinner. And although a popular restaurant, they don't give you pretentious attitude like other Chinese restaurants do.  Lobster cooked 4 ways: steamed (hardcore lobster fans will enjoy this), Maggi sauce (for people who enjoy their salt fix), fried (makes it more interesting for the usually less desirable lobster parts), and fried rice (taking the usually yucky remnants into something delicious and edible). It is definitely very smart to use all parts of the lobster this way as you don't get sick of one monotonous taste.  I am not a lobster fan. Nor a seafood fan. But I still enjoyed the taste and can still appreciate the meal. If you are a die-hard lobster fan, look no further - save your money and come here. If you're like me, it will still convert you to a fan. Be prepared to splurge (ie. $200+ bill) and go in a large party (smallest lobster is ~6-7 lbs)  I will return on an off-season month (typically $23.95/lb during March, August - October, while $20.95/lb other \"off-period\" months). Jennifer K provided an excellent tip - you may receive a small discount if you pay cash!"}
{"text":"Best lobster in Toronto.  A little pricey but worth it. The dimsum is also really good. Repeat repeat customer. Yumzo!"}
{"text":"Oh my heavens, if you ever want a great delicious king crab then this is the spot to get it. Gigantic king crab, super juicy crab meat, and it tastes magnificent. Fry it, steam it. Doesn't matter. Super awesome no matter how it is made. The other side dishes we had was good, but the main event king crab was the main attraction.   Definitely get that king crab. The owner of the restaurant is super friendly and super nice. He will go to table to table to make sure everything is good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a very inconsistent experience. The one thing going for it is that it serves big lobster and crab but one has to wonder whether the price justifies the abuse. Let me explain.  The parking lot is quite large but spots near the restaurant are very sparse. This leaves you to park further away from the restaurant and you have to walk across the parking lot to the restaurant.  This isn't so bad but the restaurant is very cramped as the tables are close together, so not a very good setup for a handicapped person with crutches or a wheelchair.  The table that we were sitting at was a large table with a round plywood surface to extended the table out; however, the plywood was in very bad condition and had holes in it. This did not lead me to have faith in this dining experience as I had to worry about liquids landing in the holes and spilling over.   The lobster and the crab were a great spectacle but when we asked for a smaller crab, the presentation didn't have the same fanfare. It was a here it is, good? Great! And away it goes.  The wait staff did not really acknowledge the non-Asians at our table and they were by no means a professional wait staff. Their handling of the food was not ideal.  The soup that we were supposed to get at the beginning of the meal was forgotten and brought to us at the end of the meal. They forgot to bring us several of our dishes including the Peking duck and our noodles. We had to complain vehemently to the wait staff and management and ended up cancelling the order for the duck. They finally brought the noodles but it was very salty and too sweet at the same time. Management was unapologetic...or it could have been the owner as he was wearing something that resembled a fishing vest.  In the end, they tried to appease us with massive amounts of desserts but by then, the damage had been done."}
{"text":"Nice typical Chinese restaurant that servers dim sum, lunch an dinner. They serve crab and lobsters all day upon request. Prices are fair and service is good.   The restaurant and the chef has won some awards and has been at good standing for many years.   It is inside the plaza with the McDonalds.   The restaurant can be rented out for events such as weddings and large birthday parties. They also have a private room available.  Overall, it's not the newest, cleanest looking place but the food is not bad and the price is fair. This is one of my go-to Chinese restaurants in Markham if I ever crave for Chinese food because I know I will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Big Stretch...Cracks fingers... Cracks neck .... Cracks Lobster shells??  That's right folks you know an intro like that can only mean that I have got something to say here...and HOT DAMN - DO I EVER!!!   On the heels of a Toronto UYE (literally it was a manicure/pedicure party), I was coerced weeks in advance by Jennifer K to attend her lobster extravaganza UYE at Omei Restaurant in Richmond Hill. This spot is located in between Bayview and Leslie on the North side of Hwy 7 (same plaza as McDonalds).   Arriving we had a large table awaiting our group of 12 right near the kitchen. While we excitedly chatted about what was to come waiters began to walk out of the kitchen carrying what I assumed to be small alien children to tables around us. To my surprise these black shiny beauties were not beings from the great beyond but quite possibly the largest lobsters I have ever seen ... like i mean ever. EVER!  A Simpsons reference comes to mind (thanks Wayne C).. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsTO57M3KgA&feature=related Ya they were THAT big.  Our table was presented with 2 giant (8lb) Pinchy's...errr I mean Lobsters. One had a rogue claw and latched on to my chopstick as poked him and explained how excited I was to eat him up (there are certain benefits to being at the top of the food chain). The other lobster knew what the deal was and tried to make a get away as the photos snapped away. Much to his chagrin his plans were foiled.  Our new found friends were whisked away to the kitchen for their last rights and processing and before long the plates began to pour out of the kitchen one after the other.  First came cracked steamed lobster cooked with scallions and garlic. This would have likely been the closest dish to a traditional lobster dinner (sans butter). It was heavenly and the vermicelli noodles under neath it all were a fav of mine as well.  Next we had Lobster cooked with Maggi Sauce, it was done with pan fried onions and the bits of lobster were so succulent that if one could climax from food alone this certainly would have been the dish to do it - Unreal (PS - they accidentally gave us a third plate of this which belonged to another table...shhhh SCORE! - it disappeared right quick as our table destroyed all the evidence)  Third item up to the plate was the fried lobster legs. While the batter had a nice flavour I found this the most awkward to eat as the deep fried bits of lobster were still covered in shell and was a tad frustrating to eat when you are a hungry hungry human!  Just when I thought that there couldn't possibly be anymore food a 4th and 5th course were brought out, both of which used the innards of the lobster to cook. I was wary of these dishes but upon trial I enjoyed them nearly as much as the ones that preceded them. The first of these Innard Skynard meals was a lobster fried rice and the other course was a steamed egg with lobster meat   Had enough yet? Or should I tell you about everything non lobster we also managed to consume while at Omei? My fav of the bunch was the veggie dish done with tons of mushrooms and Bok Choi. Loved it! The Shitake mushrooms were so tender and one of the other mushrooms absorbed sauce and juices so well that it exploded in my mouth the minute i bit into it. NOM NOM NOM. We also had Oysters done in hot peppers and a honey glaze (not my fav but still tasty) AND we even squeezed in a roast chicken dish ... because you know you can't truly stuff yourself until you've had a plate of chicken :)  Just as I was about to tap out the main courses stopped.....only to give way to a buffet of desserts (FML)! Seriously!!   Chinese desserts are not my fav thing, I must be honest so I feel my review of these items would be unfair. I just don't enjoy them - but you bet your bottom dollar I am going to keep trying. My favorite items were the freshly fried (piping hot) Chinese donuts rolled in sugar and the Mango pastry. There was another that looked like moist goat eyes (we all called them that) and the delicious taste and texture surprised me! We even had a yelp-er squeeze the black out of it ... ;-)  The highlight to my evening came as dinner was coming to a close, the owner/president of Omei (Ringo) treated us to a series of Cantonese Raps written by himself about Lobster, Crab and then just for good measure one about our dessert. All this was followed by an encore performance of the Bee Gees hit single How deep is your love. Fabulous. Just Fabulous!! Remember the movie Show Girls where they kept asking \"Have you heard Caesar sing? No? You'll Love it.\"?  Well, have you heard Ringo sing? No? CUZ You'll Love it!   Great food, great value, great host, company and entertainment!!!  OH me OMEI ... this place gets a 6TH STAR!!!"}
{"text":"You got to try the lobster here"}
{"text":"I waited over 5 minutes for a table as other walked in after and we're seated. I was finally escorted to a side room where a small table in the corner was cleared of storage and seated facing the wall next to stacked chairs. When I asked for another spot in was told that the other tables were larger and I was only 1 person. I didn't stay to eat facing the wall amongst storage in a corner of the restaurant and left."}
{"text":"If you looking  to eat lobster don't go here. Go fishman lobster clubhouse or Yu seafood.   We have been coming here for lobsters for number of years. We just went for our family dinner last week and it was shocking. We ordered 10.5 lbs lobster to share among 6 people. The lobster was big but it turned out that it was half empty. $25.99 / lbs and we mainly paid for its shell's weight. The problem got a lot worse when the server forgot to bring out our fried rice (part of lobster deal) and vege dish we ordered. We asked the server and he told us it's coming. So we wait for 15 mins and asked again. This time we asked the owner and he told us it's coming and it's being delayed on purpose so we don't get all the dishes at the same time. We waited another 15 mins and we were done eating all other dishes and asked again and we were again told its's coming.. We waited again for 5 mins and went to the kitchen door and demanded where is our lobster fried rice and the vege dish.. So we finally we got the friend rice (probably made with someone else's lobster) and the vege dish after an hour of asking for it. The server apologized but came with the bill that included 15% tip... We paid $380 for 10.5 lbs lobster that was half empty and fried rice that we had to ask 5 times.  The owner was on the floor but didn't even care... Very very very disappointing experience at Omei. I don't think I will ever go back."}
{"text":"I ended up here for the UYE organized by Jen K for the lobster 4 ways (or many ways as it was more than 4 all said and done)  I visited Omei after a loooooong time. In a word Wow!  We met up for this UYE at another UYE (this is Yelp after all where one UYE leads to another) Lobster was the main event here and we ordered 2! And boy these were giants and I mean almost 8 lbs each. They were brought on to our table an impressive sight to behold (though it did unnerve some fellow Yelpers) 1st course was steamed with scallions and garlic. A somewhat purist approach to Lobster as you get enjoy the succulent meat in its pure form. 2nd course was Lobster with Maggi Sauce. Pan fried well with onions. A nice sweet finish that went well with the main attraction. 3rd course was fried lobster legs. The batter was nice and topped with a spice that brought bit of heat to the course. 4th course was lobster innards with rice. A gourmet dish that I enjoyed. 5th course was a steamed egg with lobster meat (I haven't had this dish before) reminded me of Chawanmushi. The lobster taste was less pronounced in this course. We added a couple of dishes just to balance things out. A veggie course with clear sauce (mushrooms and bok choy)  Oyster with honey glaze and hot peppers. And believe it or not a chicken dish as well. The feast ended with a medley of desserts (2 kind of soups and 3 dessert offerings)  IMO this is a lobster luver paradise as it exposes you the various form of cooking method for this delicate ingredient.   The piece de resistance was the show/karaoke/ rap performance by the president himself Ringo!  If you are here it is a delight for him to do the presentations for each course. Definitely a place to bring to impress people.  4 Star for the food at this Place 5 stars for the UYE"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times, I can't even count anymore! Let me start off by saying that if you love dim sum, here is definitely the place to go. Everything on their menu, top to bottom with a few exceptions, is delicious. I can't even exaggerate. My favourite is the seasoned duck tongue! (I know, it sounds gross haha) their servers are super friendly and treat everyone like family! Their sui mei (not sure how to spell it) is one of the best I've ever had (and my dads a chef!) Don't even get me started with their dinner menu! Lobster, crab, sea cucumber sashimi, chow means, fried rice, everything does not disappoint.   All in all, their prices are a bit higher than the next Chinese restaurant but hey, you pay for the quality and it definitely exceeds my expectations everytime."}
{"text":"Good food with a decent price tag for a fancy lobster and crab dinner. We came here for a family feast recently, though Omei has been around for ages (I remember coming here almost 20 years ago). The service was good, though they missed one of our dishes so they didn't charge us. I think my view might be pretty skewed though, since we were having a massive dinner so they probably took better care of us. I recall when we went a long time ago the service was still good - so perhaps its pretty consistent?  The lobster and king crab were prepared really well - the seafood was extremely fresh. The vegetable dishes and chicken dishes we ordered were all on point, and the dessert was great. I especially appreciated that the soup wasn't red bean! If you're looking for a big feast dinner, here's where you should go. I'd rank this right up there with lobster fisherman villa.  note. no baby change area :( But I didn't dock a star for that - that was for the missed dish."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this place, BYOB and amazing steamed king crab and lobster. Best I had within the GTA and surrounding areas. But careful, it comes with a hefty price tag, so have your wallet ready!"}
{"text":"This is a very good authentic Chinese restaurant but a little on the expensive side. Great service and their desert platter is the best I have had."}
{"text":"I literally joined Yelp just so I could review O Mei. It is literally the absolute worst Chinese food I have ever had. My husband and I had it delivered a few weeks ago and wanted to try a new place that we were hoping was a bit more authentic. We googled, used Yelp, and settled on O Mei. We ordered the fried wontons, hot and sour soup, lemon chicken, some greens, and a beef dish that unfortunately I can't recall the name of. A spicy beef type thing. Oh, and Shanghai noodles.   First off, the hot and sour soup was inedible. It was revolting. It was a bizarre vomit colour and was tasteless. It was so thick it basically wiggled but it had NO taste. Even pouring in hot sauce wouldn't have saved it. We knew we were screwed as soon as we tasted that soup. The lemon chicken consisted of many chunk of JUST dough. It was more like chicken balls, to be honest. Tiny dry pieces of chicken in HUGE dough balls. The beef was tasteless and the poor veggies/greens were so greasy that they tasted like... old grease and MSG. The ONLY thing I ate was the fried wontons. And this mess cost us something close to $70.   Don't eat here. Don't order from me. Don't even come near here. Worst Chinese in RIchmond Hill."}
{"text":"Needed a place to take out of town visitors for a special dinner.   Based on Yelp and Chowhound reviews, decided on Omei.   Had the Lobster 5 ways, yellow-fin grouper 4 ways, a geoduck sashimi dish, plus S&S pork.  Some of the Lobster dishes were excellent as was the fish soup.  Some of the other dishes just OK and the S&S pork was mediocre.  Service was friendly, but spotty.  Seating was crowded and uncomfortable.  Price was just over $50 per person tax & tips incl which was expected and reasonable.  Glad we went, and would return but overall was not blown away."}
{"text":"Was recommended.  Stop by for late lunch.  Was not greeted by anyone.  Finally a waiter came to seat us.  Then was ignored for about 15 mins.  They brought out most food in about 10 mins.  Missing stuffed crab claws.  All the time we were there no one even asked how anything was or asked if we needed anything such as hot sauce etc.. After about 10 mins of eating, I asked for the bill.  They billed us for food that they did not even delivered.  After the corrections the female server slide the bill from her seat( we sat at the corner beside the hostess desk) She didn't even make any eye contact.   Overall, food was pretty good.  Price was on the pricy side compared to similar qualities.  Service(s) was awful.  Wouldn't recommend the restaurant unless you don't care for service."}
{"text":"I'm kind of bias when it comes to this review on Omei. My whole family is considered extreme VIP here. We even know the names of most of the servers, waiters and waitresses there.  We come here religiously for dim sum on Sunday afternoons and all the staff here know what we like, where we like to sit and give us the best customer service I've ever had at a Chinese restaurant.  The managers and owner of Omei always thank us for coming to visit and dining with them.  It's my favourite dim sum restaurant, not just for the variety of dishes that they offer but also because they always offer a variety of desserts.  We've always been here for dinner services, which is always delicious.  They have the largest crabs and lobsters I've ever seen and they always present it to you, live, before making it into seafood dishes.  They have different ways in which they make the crab and lobster dishes.. One crab or lobster makes about four different dishes of just lobster or crab alone!  You can have the crab or lobster cooked any way you like whether it's rice noodles with garlic or steamed crab to a panko-like battered fried crab.  With that we always get fresh jellyfish, lobster and a variety of asian dishes and for dessert we always get three different choices.  They also have yummy mango glutinous dumpling with coconut shavings which is also made fresh daily.  Whether I am VIP here or not, I would definitely recommend checking out this restaurant for either dim sum or dinner service. All I have to say is, omei omei, oh my!"}
{"text":"I had dim sum with my relatives at Omei Restaurant.  I had always seen Omei Restaurant from the street when driving along Highway 7 but this was my first time dining there.  I had always thought it was a very high-end restaurant that was fancy inside and expensive.  However, when we went there for dim sum last week, it turned out that Omei Restaurant was just another Chinese restaurant.  It certainly wasn't fancy-looking inside and even a little run-down with traditional Chinese restaurant colour schemes.  We ordered a number of dim sum and small dishes to share.  We were able to receive a 15 percent discount that day off our bill which made the meal even cheaper!  I liked all of the dim sum dishes.  They were very typical and the tastes were true to what each dim sum traditionally tastes like.  The steamed spareribs were hot and tasty with just enough fat and meat ratio.  So yummy!  Their steamed beef stomach with satay sauce was really well done.  The beef stomach wasn't chewy at all and very soft.  It soaked up all of the satay sauce too.  I was particularly pleased to find out that they served us complimentary Chinese soup desserts after the meal too!  They served the Purple Rice Pudding in Coconut Milk dessert that I like."}
{"text":"Come here for the lobster 4 ways ($28/lb)!  1. Steam 2. Maggie stir fried  3. Steam egg 4. Fried rice   We were a group of 14. We had a 9lb lobster done 4 ways plus the following dishes  1. Sweet and sour pork 2. Deep fried pork chop 3. Mushroom and pea shoot  4. Egg yolk fried shrimp 5. Crispy chicken   Free desserts!! 1. Sesame balls 2. Mango mochi 3. Red bean soup 4. Coconut sago soup 5. Fried egg white donut with sugar   All the dishes were done very well!   I like how they don't try to up sell you anything.  Honest and good service.   Bring cash and you may get a discount   We were all stuffed. Satisfied. Happy.  $40 pp include tax and tips. What a steal !"}
{"text":"Definitely good quality seafood.  Crab was very fresh and good as per my family since I couldn't eat it due to allergy.  Their lobster was very fresh and tasty.  Their maggi style lobster was more sweeter and saltier than Fisherman Clubhouse.   Went here with my family of 5 including myself, hefty price for about $700 just for crab and lobster for us 5 but you get 10% off I believe if you pay cash.  We would probably go back once in awhile but Fisherman Clubhouse still my family's favourite."}
{"text":"The king crab here is by far the best that I have ever eaten.  The crab we got was 10lbs and they prepared it in 5 different ways using multiple parts of the crab (steamed, garlic, fried, and multiple sauces).  We also got 4 dishes to accompany this and all in all, a very good meal for our first trip here.  Service here was also much better than your typical asian restaurant.  They are very attentive and the host (owner?) was very funny and entertaining.  He also came to debone and serve our sea bass, which was a nice touch.  Dessert wasn't as good but what is important is that you come here for the main course."}
{"text":"Omei OH MY! What a lobster feast!   A group of us 12 yelpers recently came here for a lobster dinner set up by our yelp leader Jennifer K. Our menu for the night consisted of 2 lobsters, each about the size of a small toddler. Before their immanent demise the lobsters were paraded onto our table, creating some amusing photo-ops for us yelpers, this did not last too long as they were swiftly taken away to meet their fate. These bad boys were cooked 5 ways for us.   - Steamed lobster in the shell with scallions and garlic was my favourite dish of the night. Although a little more simple than the other dishes I found it really brought out the taste of the lobster. The scallions added a nice sharp taste but this dish truly allowed the lobster to be the star. The lobster was steamed to perfection and the bed of vermicelli it was served on soaked up all the lobster flavour; the vermicelli was to die for!   -  Stir fried with Maggie sauce showcased the giant claws and head of the mammoth lobsters, while one yelper opted for the head I dug into the claw which was meaty, perfectly tender and complimented well by the slightly sweet sauce. This was a nice dish.   - Deep fried lobster proved difficult to eat, but the hard work was certainly warranted as the breading was not too thick and the dish was nicely fried without being greasy. Another winner.   - Fried rice with lobster brains was probably my least favourite lobster dish of the night. I found the rice a tad dry, and the brains didn't really add too much of a lobster taste.   - Last lobster dish to come out was a steamed egg custard with more lobster brains. What is with all the brains? Is this supposed to make me smarter? The custard had a great texture and was complimented well by the strong, slightly salty taste of the lobster brain. This was a surprise hit for me.   In addition to lobster we also order a couple of green veggie dishes and sweet and sour pork, both these dishes were pretty standard, I suppose one needs some greenery when devouring so much lobster. Our meal was also served with some complimentary desserts my favourite of which was the mango mochi, great fresh mango flavour with a nice chewy texture. 2 dessert soups I tried but I did not enjoy, the one with taro was especially offensive (taro for dessert, now I've seen it all).   The restaurant itself had a pretty standard Chinese décor, the tables were packed in tight, and it was pretty loud in there. It was great to see all the giant lobsters and king crabs being taken to everybody's table, it certainly makes for a great show. The service seemed good, and the owner kept checking on us to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. I will definitely be back to Omei for some lobster; it is certainly a better and cheaper option for lobster than some western restaurants."}
{"text":"Amazing seafood. Prices are on the steep side, but you really get what you pay for at this place.  I went in a large group and they gave us 5 different plates of complimentary desserts at the end of our meal. What. One of which included a mango mochi. Whaat. I would even rate it as better than the $5 ones you have to pay for at those Chinese dessert houses. As someone with a proclivity for all things free, this definitely won me over as my favourite seafood spot uptown."}
{"text":"I brought my family here and they are the hardest people to please....really hard!  This place offers a variety of cooking styles for one big seafood items which kept everyone excited for the next dish. Everything was fresh and succulent, preordered zhong gwa tong (melon soup) and ordered lobster, geoduck and other typical chinese dishes. I loved that they gave us 4 different desserts; mango coconut mochi, black sesame tong yuen, chinese doughnut, red bean tong sui and coconut sago tong sui.  atmosphere: typical chinese restaurant, not those fancy ones with overprices menu items. Don't get my wrong, this place was still pricey but a good deal based on the quantity and quality of food.  service: server was good, very knowledgeable of seafood and practically ordered everything for us...lol but bus boy was rude, first thing I heard him say to the hostess was that I was a \"jok sing\" as if I didn't understand. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it cause my dad would add fuel to the fire. Plus I glared at him at every chance I got to make him feel bad hehe   overall my picky family was impressed so its a safe place to taking anyone that you would want to impress!"}

{"text":"Favourite Chinese seafood restaurant. I prefer it over fishermans. The quality is top notch and flavour is great. This restaurant is becoming more like a fixed menu type of restaurant letting you choose only expensive menus. The lobster they have now are only 8 lbs and up. Last year I came, they still have 3/4 lbs lobsters. It only makes senses to get the combo cause you get more bang for your buck. The menu we chose fed up to 8 people. We had a 8.5 pound lobster made 4 ways (steamed with garlic, Garlic and onion stir fry, deep fried, fried rice with the brains) all 4 styles were delish! It also came with a shark fin soup (broth was super rich), veggies, sweet and sour pork. The side dishes were not your average Chinese dishes- it was definitely more elevated and taste so good! Dessert was awesome as well, we had red bean,  taro with sago, mango mochi, dumpling with sesame inside and lastly deep fried tofu with red bean and sugar. What restaurant provides 4 desserts at no additional cost ? Amazing. Will def be back and p.s a few Chinese Celebs have been there as well."}
{"text":"I took my family along with my parents for what I was expecting to be a great lobster (4 ways) dinner.  As I had been two times prior and never disappointed, I was expecting the same quality food and service.  I made reservations a week a head as it was a Saturday and anticipating that it would be busy.  We got to the restaurant, they said they couldn't locate the reservation and I looked at the list and located it in less than a minute.  We were seated at the table righty by the door.  We were greeted by the waiter who we had dealt with in the past.  We told him that we wanted the lobster done 4 ways and than he tried to up sell everything else on the menu.  Having been here in the past we politely told him we would be interested in only getting an extra vegetable dish.  So we ordered the snow peas with mushrooms.  The first to arrive at the table was the dish with the lobster stir fried with garlic, ginger and green onions.  The lobster meat was a bit tough and not as flavourful as it had been in the past.  The next to arrive was the lobster with the maggi sauce and it was absolutely divine the best thing I had all night.  It tasted very succulent and tender and the meat fell off the shell.  The third to come out was the deep fried lobster legs.  This was by far the most disappointing of all the dishes 80% of it was left untouched as there was absolutely nothing to eat.  The snow peas with mushrooms came at this point and it was so so as I have had better at other restaurants.  The last dish for the lobster was the fried rice.  Again, this dish never disappoints and the fried garlic bits in the rice just adds a whole new level to fried rice.  They served us dessert thereafter, we got a warm soup I think thy said it was black sesame, along with a mango mochi and another rice ball dessert with honey on the inside.  These were all delicious and enjoyed by everyone.  Overall, I would give the experience a 3.5 because a couple of the dishes were lacking and the service dropped off once we had ordered our food they were no longer attentive."}
{"text":"Good lobster! We came as a group of 6 on a week night so there was no wait. Only like 3 other tables other than us.   They started us off with a plate of cucumbers. Coming from a person who doesn't like cucumbers... These have got to be the best ones I ever had. Probably cleared half the plate by myself. For the main, we got the lobster done 5 ways: steamed, maggi stir fried, deep fried, steam egg and fried rice. All the dishes came out fast and all the flavours were great! The only thing that they tried to over sell us... They told us that the smallest they had was 7lbs, which is a lot for 6 ladies! We also got a plate of veggies with mushrooms and sweet and sour pork. We had to pack most of it home!  For dessert, they came with all five different types: black glutinous rice soup, taro sago soup, sesame balls, mango mochi and deep fried egg white balls. All the desserts were really good (other than the mango not being in season), but pretty sure we got a pretty fresh batch of the egg white balls with new oil.   My only complaint is that like most Chinese restaurants, they really do try to squeeze money out of you. They offer a discount if you pay in cash so be prepared to come with lots of bills! We tried to push them into giving us a smaller lobster but apparently they already gave us the smallest one they had. We ended up spending about $50 each with tax and tip, which is still reasonable but more than I would like to pay for a regular meal. I would definitely be back for more... But only for special occasions!"}
{"text":"Used to be good and we ate their regularly. A couple months ago we  had a very substandard delivery meal. It was quite inedible and we brought it back the next morning and met with the manager. Rather than examining it or apologizing he nonchalantly took the food and promised us 3 dish credits on our next order (we returned 6 or 7). This week we decided to try again and use our credits. They won't honour them. We are past the 60 day limit (huh?, it would have been nice to have been told that when we were given the credits) and they no longer have any record of it.  We had a good 30 year run with them (started at their original location)  and now it's definitely time to move on. We'd much rather spend our money at restaurants that care about their food and customers. Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"To start off this is not my first time coming here. The past SEVERAL years my father's side of the family loves coming here for morning dim sum for Chinese New Year usually on the Sunday. Every year I always had something to complain about the dim sum but it was never so horrible that I can't eat it and I am always able to eat enough to be okay for the next couple hours.   This year I had THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. We arrived early around 11am and waited for them to put a table for us (i didn't remove a star for this) since my aunt never makes reservation. Fine whatever. We split the family in two as always; children one table and grown ups in another. We ordered a bunch of food and waited.   This is the terrible part, the raddish cake (not sure if this is correct in english) was expired? bad? I can't even begin telling you how horrible it was. The taste was mushy and it tasted like the whole thing was more than a week old. I had the mistake of swallowing one piece since last year it was pretty good and after that piece i couldn't bear to eat another. The sesame ball with lotus filling inside was also expired or bad. The lotus inside had a weird smell and the taste was terrible as well. We had the XO sauce pan fried rice roll which is one of my favourites and sadly this also tasted mushy and not even pan fried. We had a few more dishes and none of the plates were finished on my table. Some poor soul had to take it home with them and feed it to their kids which later they probably threw out since they all got sick.   On the way home, which was a good thirty mins to an hour I started feeling stomach pains. At first I thought it might have been not eating enough since everything tasted so bad. NO, after I got home a full hour or two later it felt like there were daggers in my stomach. Nothing can describe the pain I was feeling. I tried to take a nap and waited for my boyfriend to come pick me up and broke out in fever. The next day I had to stay home from work because of the stomach pains and diarrhea. I wasn't the only one that got sick, my parents, sister and cousins got sick as well from this. Third day and I'm still feeling horrible but I figured I should start telling people to be AWARE of this place. I don't know about their \"dinners\" etc but PLEASE AVOID THE DIM SUM IF POSSIBLE."}
{"text":"I was up in Markham for the weekend with some friends.  My friend wanted to try the Buddha Jumping Over Wall soup so we went there for lunch.  It was dimsum in the morning but they also serve that soup.  We ordered the soup and some typical dimsum fare.  Dim sum was nothing spectacular and I found a surprise in our cheurng fun.  I pointed out there was a hair on it they replaced it with another one and apologized.  I was pretty grossed out.  The Buddha Jumping Over Wall soup has lots of \"pricey\" ingredients like a small abalone, dried scallops, fish maw, sea cucumber, black chicken, mushroom etc.  It tastes just like the chicken soup that my mom makes at home.  It was nothing extraordinary and definately wasnt worth the price tag."}
{"text":"We came here for Christmas Eve dinner with some friends and got the multiple course meal selection that came with: 11 lb lobster (served 4 ways: stirfried with garlic, deep fried with garlic, steamed, and fried rice with lobster brain... deeeelicious), sea cucumber (served 2 ways: raw and deep fried with batter), sweet and sour pork, king mushroom with veggies (I can't remember what they're called), steamed chinese broccoli, and 2 types of dessert.   The food itself was good albiet a tad bit greasy, but that's expected at most Chinese restaurants. The raw sea cucumber was served on a bed of ice that was plastic wrapped, to keep the sea cucumber from getting too soggy (I think) and was delicious. This was my first time having it and I think I'm hooked. The taste is comparable to surf clam but not chewy at all. The lobster dishes were flavourful however they weren't any different from what you would expect at other locations. I was told this place was better than Fisherman's Clubhouse however I disagree. Both places taste good however Omei is lacking in presentation and is greasier. Don't expect to come here for a fancy dinner. There is very bright flourescent lighting and the tables are cramped!!    The layout of the restaurant is terrible. We were seated near the front and it looked like there was a riot the entire 2.5 hours we were there with people waiting for tables to be available. Also, the tables were positioned so close together that it was nearly impossible to leave your seat and head to the washroom. A few of my friends were even baraccaded in their seats! So here's a tip, if you want to try it out, request a table as far away from the entrance as possible as they don't have a proper foyer. With that said, every time someone would come in there would be huge gush of freezing air.    The highlight of the dinner would have to be the dessert. You got two kinds, one looked like a mango pudding ball covered with shredded coconut and another one was a ball made of tapioca flour covered in sesame seeds and had a black sesame filling - this one was my favourite and very yummy! Both desserts are not overly sweet which is good for me since I don't have much of a sweet tooth.   Our bill for 10 people came up to about $650, $750 after 15% gratuity."}
{"text":"I took my family to this restaurant a couple of times and have always had a good time. Excellent wok hay lobster that reminds me of Hong Kong. Be forwarned though, they will always try and oversell you on the lobster as its sold by weight.  My bill came to over $300 for 3 adults and 2 kids."}
{"text":"The $368 set for king crab dinner five ways was expensive but we had to try it ...and we were happy the friendly manager talked us into it.  Arriving late in Toronto we weren't sure if there were much open but the restaurant was still fully packed...my favorite was all the free desserts that came with the Meal and since I love the mochi balls so much, the manager packed an extra 20 for us to take! Now that's service!"}
{"text":"My family has been visiting this restaurant for years. There's some good and bad to this place, but we keep going back for the delicious seafood.   Toronto has many Chinese seafood restaurants, yet Omei stands out amongst the crowd. The seafood is fresh, cooked to perfection and seasoned with the right balance of flavours. Over the years, we've tried multiple soups, steamed fish, blanched shrimps, geoduck sashimi, the 4 ways cooked lobster and the 4 ways cooked king crab. Amazingly, there hasn't been a dish we didn't enjoy. The chef is really quite skilled to be able to master this many dishes. Verdict? The food is excellent.   The 3 star rating is due to the questionable service and poor seating/decor. As other reviewers have noted, there is no English menu. The waiters and manager will recommend dishes to you in English verbally, but fail to mention the price. Extremely inconvenient way to order food. A lot of times we just end up ordering food without knowing the exact pricing. The manager also tries to sell the most expensive dishes to you first, often he recommends the king crab. If you pay by credit card or debit, they choose their own tip of 15% without asking you first. As for the seating, there's not a lot of space. The tables and chairs are all bunched up together in a way that makes you wonder how to escape if there was a fire. It's not comfortable.   Overall I'd recommend it for the food only."}
{"text":"Owner never reached out to us to correct issue. Which means customer service is non existent... I don't recommend anyone to eat here.   Whoever rated this place 4-5 stars have no tastebuds and would probably eat garbage fed to them... or the owner paid people to give his restaurant 5 stars. Look at the REAL comments they are mostly 1-2 stars.   This place is garbage!"}
{"text":"I was hoping I could rely on the positive reviews I read but I was wrong, again. The food, which is the most important issue, was WAY BELOW the standard of an excellent restaurant. I ordered the honey garlic ribs, they were chewy, the sauce that went with it SUCKED. The shrimp dish that i ordered was lacking ANY FLAVOUR,  The price for a snow pea leaf vegetarian dish was OVERPRICED and after trying 4 dishes I pushed the uneaten food away and left. NOT GOING BACK ."}
{"text":"We ordered the lobster cooked 4-ways. This is really the test when it comes to a kitchen's quality. Each of the ways the lobster is cooked either highlights the lobster or the flaws of the cooking. Starting with the steamed lobster with clear noodles, you get a taste for the actual lobster without any flavours to mask it. A bit tough or dry and the chef has overcooked it. Fortunately for us, this was cooked perfectly. The maggi sauce cooked lobster is stir fried and layers a light sauce over the lobster. This deep fried lobster had a light batter that did not overpower the actual lobster but added a nice crispy texture to it. Batter can be a personal thing, but over batter, and you end up with eating more dough than seafood. Not to mention after a few minutes the batter becomes soggy. Lastly, the rice was abundant with the remains of the lobster throughout. This dish has only a few ingredients, which is really all you need.  The sweet and sour pork was ultra-crispy. I would rank this one as one of the top in the area. I've had this dish at many places, but haven't had one as crispy as the one here.  Finally, the desserts were a great way to finish the meal. The mango rice balls are refreshing and something I haven't found anywhere else.  Having been to Fisherman's house where you get a mountain of lobster, I would definitely come back to O'Mei instead. Don't let the look of Fisherman's fool you, when you're spending this kind of money, it better taste amazing as well."}
{"text":"When high expectations are not met, you are often disappointed and left wanting more or better. That's unfortunately the case here at O-Mei Restaurant.  The owner of restaurant approached our table, greeting us with a large smile. What followed thereafter, unfortunately, was not smiles from us. The owner beseeched us with recommendations and offers on the menu. Personally, a recommendation or two would not be a hassle -- but a friendly offering and gesture. However, the owner consistently nagged us. In my subjective opinion, I prefer to read the menu and decide what to eat alone with my table mates. Perhaps I'm too harsh, but I consider this poor service.    To begin our meal off, the daily soup arrived at our table steaming hot. The tofu and the shrimps were the highlights of this dish, balancing the soup nicely.  The soup warmed my stomach for the meal.  The razor clams were fresh and delicious. The clams were served alongside a hot pot filled with a clear broth and wasabi with soy sauce. The combination of all ingredients  and flavors complimented together nicely. However, the quantity was not worth the price.  The insipid dish of chow mein was a huge disappointment. The noodles were oily and greasy, lacking the basic seasoning or flavors. The ingredients were not fresh and mostly overcooked.  The stir fried vegetables with beef and carrots. The dish simply lack the wok hei you expect from a Chinese dish.   As a reviewer, I tend to be optimistic and focus on the positives of every restaurant. However, the negatives of O-Mei cannot be simply overlooked, and if I may candidly write, the negatives outweighed the positives. The razor clams and soup were great. But the service and insipid dishes of chow mein and stir fired vegetables drags the restaurant down. I touched upon a few dishes that stood to my attention. If your stomach and mind desires food, O-Mei is not recommended."}
{"text":"No reservation needed.  Atmosphere: Half filled dining room, but it was 6:30 on a wed evening, rainy day outside. Otherwise, it was nicer than the typical chinese restaurant, but still casual dress. Don't bring your fancy hot date here unless you've been dating for a while and want to stuff your faces with great food rather than gaze in each other's eyes for hours.  Got the lobster 4 ways (6lbs, approx $19/lb), + chinese broccoli (needed SOME veggies). Ended being approx $175 (inc tax and tip). (for 2 ppl, because yours truly is a glutton. Easily could have fed 4. Ended taking some little leftovers home.   So they bring out one big-ass lobster on a platter (still alive and moving), to show it off, and to get your approval, before they cook and whack it into the appropriate pieces. Cool and a little unnerving.  Food: Delicious.  way #1: Lobster in a garlic and scallion sauce with thin vermicelli noodles. way #2: wok-sauteed lobster with onions in soy-garlic sauce. way #3: lobster deep fried (at other restos, i've heard this style called \"aromatic,\" also heard it called, \"salt and pepper fried\") it is fried, and it is salted, but doesn't really fit either of the above names.  way #4: lobster guts?/brains? innards in stir fried rice. Rice is great, the innards are great if you love that sort of thing, not that great if you don't (me), but regardless, it gives the fried rice that extra lobster flavor and aroma.  All 4 styles were great, but I liked #1 and 2 best. I've had style #2 many times before, but #1 was new to me. I like the sauce in #1 so much, i spooned some into my fried rice.  Broccoli was good, but nothing too special.  Dessert (included): Red bean soup was perfect after a big meal. (is there a bit of milk in there?). Little mochi balls with light sesame syrup, not heavy with the sweetness like other places. Last were little puffs, sugared like donuts, with a bit of red bean sweetness inside. I wasn't a fan, mostly because it had a bit too much egg flavor to it, which was weird with the spongy donuts.   Quantity: Fantastic, even for a glutton like me. Price: It's pricey, so bring plenty of dough  OH, BIG THING: Most of the waiters/waitresses don't speak English, and their menu's have NO English on them. Our waiter did ask, \"4 ways lobster?\" when he realized that it was our first time there and we didn't speak Chinese. Later, a younger waitress came up and spoke english, and explained how they would do the 4 ways lobster for the two of us.  So, expect it, and ask to have the one waitress who speaks English. hahahaha  All in all, a fantastic find, and a great place to take a group of 4-6 ppl."}
{"text":"This will be my first review on O Mei even though I go here religiously. I tend to go for weekend morning Dimsum. The service is always great as Lisa is our server majority of the time. She calls me Lang Jai (Pretty Boy). Flattery definitely helps tips :P   I have gone there for dinner as well. Anytime of day, the food there is really good and there is a large variety of menu items. I continue to go to O Mei and I would recommend it to others to order the gigantic Lobster or Crab!!"}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday dinner on Sunday and as a seafood fan, I was not disappointed. We ordered king crab and the 8 dishes that followed, lobster noodles, vegetables, soup and a chicken dish. The king crab meat was sweet and cooked in many different ways - one simply steamed, cooked with garlic, fried etc..Nothing beats fresh seafood. The service was very attentive and I believe the owner comes and talks to every table. He is very persuasive and could probably sell you anything! They also changed our plates very often and came and checked in on us to ensure that we had everything that we needed. The desserts that came after our meal was also a lovely gesture, there was steamed egg buns with red bean paste, rice balls with sesame paste and mango coconut balls. Please note that they do not have an English menu so I would recommend going with someone who speaks Chinese or you may be stuck with American Chinese foods (spring rolls etc..) and they also offer take out. They also provide a 5% discount if you pay with cash."}
{"text":"Great lobster dinner! We were brought here by our local relatives and they prefer this place over the fancy/hyped fisherman's.   We ordered a giant lobster, which I thought was suitable for a table of 12 but not gigantic. But to my surprise, they managed to turn it into 5 courses. There was a steamed lobster over glass noodles dish, stir fried lobster dish, deep fried lobster dish, lobster brain fried rice, and lobster brain steamed egg. The fried rice was dry, but the rest were delicious!  Other dishes were good too, but the lobster was the highlight"}
{"text":"Big lobster 5 courses dinner is a must!  Also geoduck sashimi is one of my favourite. Remember leave room for the dessert!"}
{"text":"Took them a while to get  our food out but it was very busy on a Monday night so I could maybe understand.  We had excellent food.  I forget what we got persay (problem with them writing dishes in chinese and me not being able to read chinese...) but everything we got was excellent!  I have been here many times over the years of visiting Canada and have always had great food there and if you get dessert, i know it's odd getting dessert at a chinese place that isn't that powdery tasting red bean soup, you will not be disappointed.  Try the mango dessert or the puff balls.  They also have a purple rice soup which is pretty good too.    You will like this place for sure.  They do offer this crazy 8 lb lobster cooked 4 ways with various pieces.  It is super expensive like 150? But I don't know if it's worth it per say.  I did not have it but if you like lobster, order it for your entire meal, it looked really cool though :)  hidden gem: If you pay in cash sometimes you get a discount :)"}
{"text":"There have been enough reviews about Omei's lobsters and king crabs.  This review is based on a dinner without the lobsters and king crabs.  I dined here with my mom on a weekday a few months ago.  We didn't know much about this restaurant prior.  We were seated at a small table and were given the menus.  Afterwards, they left us alone.  From the lack of smile, I felt that the services were slightly cold and inattentive.  Furthermore, the restaurant was not so busy that they had to ignore us. I originally thought that the cold service might be because we were not regular customers.    While reading the menu, I saw that some waiters took out large lobsters and king crabs on plates to show a few bigger groups of customers.  We were intrigued but obviously could not order the seafood.  My mom and I concluded that this restaurant might specialize in exquisite seafood.  Thus, we ordered a \"Budda Jump Wall\" as soup, a hot pot and a stir-fried vegetable.  The waitress assured us that the soup was sufficient to share among two people.  The Budda Jump Wall was very impressive.  The restaurant did not skim on quality ingredients and long cooking time.  In my opinion, it was of top banquet quality, with a whole abalone, a large Japanese mushroom, some sea cucumbers, dried scallops and dried oysters.  Both my mom and I were glad that we ordered it; it was worthy of the price.  The hot pot and stir-fried vegetables were delicious but were small in portion.  If I rated this dinning experience based on the food alone, I should have given 4 stars.  However, considering the lack of attentive services, I should take out 1 star.  I didn't know for sure, but I suspected that they were disinterested in us because there was no chance for them to sell us the costlier lobsters and king crabs.  I was taken back by this discriminating service attitude.  How do they expect us to get over this services and return for the Budda Jump Wall again?   ADDED on SEPTEMBER 8, 2015: Not really an update but additional information that the dim sum was pretty delicious and fresh.  There was no flat priced dim sum specials on weekends."}
{"text":"We came here for a friend's birthday.  We order many food because we have 14 of us.  We start off with 9.5 lb Lobster.  They use lobster to make a few dishes (steam, fry, etc). The lobster is fresh and tasty.  We also ordered other dishes for this dinner.  There were a lot of customers and the food came out very quickly to my surprise.  I found out that they want us to finish within 2 hours so that they can serve the next customer with our table.  The service is not the best compare to other higher end restaurant.  They don't have enough waiters and waitresses to serve all the customer.  This is one area they need to improve on.  The desert is top notch.  The manager was willing to give us extra desert for our birthday boy.  Overall the food is good but very pricey.  Averaging $20 a dish after tips and tax."}
{"text":"Chinese restaurants/dim sum houses have their own criteria: expect noise, hustle, and brusque but timely service. Even then, Omei was downright bitter. Came here on a Saturday night for Grandma's 90th birthday, 13 people (including kids), and went hard-in-the-paint with lobster served 3 ways, shark-fin soup, abalone, and 5 kinds of dessert. Lobster was good (steamed with garlic, and another, sprinkled with garlic and spicy bits). Mango mochi brought the house down. AND YET...  While the food was premium, everything else was not. We were seated in a cramped corner (not atypical), but instead of serving out the food for each guest, the servers threw down the communal dishes and left us to fend for ourselves. \"Pass the fish, please\" becomes a war zone for 13 people stacked together like dominoes; I can't count the number of times I almost got a chopstick in the eye. By the end, I had my plate on my lap and was eating off of it as with street food. I'm surprised my grandma made it to and from the bathroom alive.  Other highlights: dirty dishes stacked throught the meal; servers clean up your utensils while you're still eating; and responses to \"can you get more toothpicks please\" include \"can't you see those in front of you?\". Meanwhile, the bill came to $100 per person and had service charges included in it as well.   Note the lack of photos because it was impossible to even wield a phone at my table.  Overpriced food, disastrous environment....this was one bitter, bitter meal. While Omei's daytime dim sum may be a-okay, save yourself the family disputes, heartache, etc. that can result from throwing a celebratory dinner here. (Yes, parents refused to look each other in the eye the day after.)"}
{"text":"I didn't get to eat there, 1 star is for their greedy management.   Made a reservation for last Sat at 6:30pm. We got there right on time, it was completely packed with people waiting everywhere. YES, there was no room for waiters to deliver food! I was totally expecting a lineup because it's Chinese NYE, but this is way beyond ridiculous.   We waited till almost 8pm, still no sign of getting a table soon, and it was too late to go somewhere else nice for a Chinese NYE dinner. They shouldn't take more reservations than they could handle. Their greediness totally screwed up other people's schedule."}
{"text":"lobster cooked 4 ways - Steamed (2nd favourite) - Stir Fried with Maggie Sauce (my favourite) - Deep Fried (3rd favourite) - Fried Rice with Brain (4th favourite because very little lobster brain)  We asked for a 6 pound lobster and ended up getting 8.25 pound. This happens every time so they can make extra money. This is not good practice but I will let it slide since I'm a nice guy :) Next time I should ask for a 4 pound lobster so we can get 6 pounds. We were charged $181 before tax for the lobster cooked 4 ways, so if my math is correct its $21.94 / lb - HOLY CRAPPERS thats expensive when just a few months ago I went to Fishman Lobster Clubhouse and was charged $16.95 / lb - Once again I will let this slide since its not lobster season.   Also got deep fried oysters for $18 - its okay but nothing special and quite expensive for what you get  Also got sweet and sour beef ribs $13 - I liked this dish, the meat was plentiful and tender and the sauce was not overpowering, great value for the price  Also got some greens (snowpeas leaves) $16 - once again pretty expensive but  its out of season so this will be the third slide of the review :)  Best part of the meal was the complementary desserts  - Red Bean Sweet Soup - Taro Sweet Soup - Mango Mochi - Deep Fried Egg White with sugar - Black Sesame Balls   All desserts were very good but my favourite was the taro soup. It was so good we even asked for more and they were more than willing to give us more on the house. Service was great and they kept on replace our overflowing lobster shell dishes multipule times so we would always have a clean and empty dish.  Food - 4 Service - 5 Price - 2"}
{"text":"I've only been here for dim sum with my colleagues, but I've heard amazing things about their lobster dinners!   We came as a group of 14 people and were seated in the private room. The restaurant has your typical dim sum dishes, which you choose from an extensive list. In addition to dim sum dishes, they have your larger plates such as fried rice, noodles, wonton skin.   Quality is pretty good, but it's not mind-blowing. Service was quick, and they were quick to assist. Overall, if you're craving dim sum, and you're in the area then drop by, but I wouldn't go out of my way from downtown to eat here for dim sum."}
{"text":"What do you get with a table of 12 hungry yelpers and two large lobsters? Thank you Jennifer K. (Super hero Yelper) for organising.   Lobster 5 ways of course and some very happy yelper tummies in a very packed and crazy busy chinese restaurant.  Course 1 - is the simplest - lobster meat steamed in shell with scallions and garlic on a bed of vermicelli noodles - so good and fresh and I am not a lobster fan and we all went to wolfed it down as if it was our last meal on earth - either that or we were just hungry... (I'm banking on the fact that it had tasted soo damn good)  Course 2 - classic Stir fried lobster in Maggie Sauce (MSG soy Sauce) - with the huge claw and Head being stir-fried in Maggie sauce - Lobster wasn't tough and but nice and succulent tender juicy from the maggie and the wok. The chef here definitely knows how to work that wok hai.   Course 3 - was the deep fried lobster with chili pepper salt. Yummy - but not enough chili pepper seasoning - but still excellent. I agree with another's assessment that dealing with the shells to get at the meat is annoying - but that is what chopsticks are for.   Course 4 - lobster innards fried rice - also very good - to the point where I wanted another dish of that fried rice.   Course 5 - lobster brain steamed egg custard - this is a childhood comfort food favourite dish - steamed egg custard - but the lobster brains kick it up a notch with wow factor - the smooth silky scrambled egg with the salty tang of the lobster brains is just the way to wind down the lobster fiesta with a sigh and a murmur of happy satisfaction and a grateful thought for our two lobster victims.   Also served braised greens with whole cloves of garlic and another green dish -  not too bad, a bit small. But the braised greens with the whole cloves of garlic stood out among the veggie dishes.  Dessert was a duo of sweet soups, red bean with black glutinous rice and sweet almond soup with tapioca served with fresh mango mochi.  Definitely the Mango mochi was the hit of the dessert dishes - so much so that we had to another plate of it to gobble down and into our stuffed stomachs.   Many thanks again to Ms. Jennifer K. For pulling off such a memorable evening."}
{"text":"On a Saturday night the restaurant was packed. Reservations made for 6 o'clock for 7 ppl. The restaurant was packed. Food came okay fast. We got the lobster combo for 6 ppl.   Lobster was 8 lbs served 2 ways. The soup came after the lobster... kinda weird but they were so busy. No one changed our plates. We were being rushed out even though we didn't finish dessert. They gave us our bill. We understood but didn't really like that gesture.   The food was delicious but 2 of the dishes were over salty. The food was enough to feed 8 ppl even though it's for a 6 ppl combo.   Dessert we got mango Mochi and a sesame rice roll. Also came with sweet soup but it was different types.  Would come back with a big group and only with reservations."}
{"text":"Omei? O my! This is a royal seafood feast!! All those giant crustaceans in the tank ready to be served in a variety of ways! My family and I have been here several times and the food never disappoints. The last time were there we ordered both a lobster and a crab - both enormous! The both came to say hello, crawled on our table for a few seconds and off they went to the back. The different ways they are cooked in have already been described in previous posts, so I won't get into that. All you have to know is that you will not leave hungry, far from it, and it is all delicious. Even the tomalley gets it's own dish (yes I LOVE the green stuff inside the crustacean's shell). After dinner is the parade of desserts ... so many different kinds!!  So ... why 4 stars? I guess I could give it 4.5 but sometimes the service there is just plain awful, yet the food is sooooo good, I won't dock them that much."}
{"text":"Came here for family dinner and my oh my does this place get packed fast! Once it reached 6:30pm, despite reservations, there was tons of people lined up already  Very fresh seafood and wide selection.  Everything tasted delicious without the grease (fried or excess oil) on any of the food.  I would highly recommend their king crab dish as they make it with green onion slivers and vermicelli noodles that will make you wanting more.  They also have a wide selection of desserts ranging from purple rice taro soup to sweet pea tapioca soup which are all delicious and not overly sweet.  Ambiance was good.  Bright and medium noise level so chatting within the table is just right.  Downside would be seating which is very tight and packed together.  It would be same whether winter or summer which still makes everything feel too snug."}
{"text":"I've only had dim sum here but i know many people Who come here for Chinese dinners. They have king crabs and lots of fresh live seafood. The dim sum here is slightly more expensive than other near by places and they don't seem to have a cart. It seems more of made to order. The food is good but for dim sum, I've tasted better."}
{"text":"This place was recommended for their amazing seafood, so we had to try.  When we got there we realized that they had only given us the Chinese menu, we don't read Chinese so we requested the English menu but immediately after the waiter and owner warned us that there's nothing good on the English menu.  The owner went through their seafood menu and we ended up getting the lobster 4 different ways: with green onions and ginger, kind of sweet and sour, deep fried with batter and the lobster fried rice.  It was amazing, the 2 of us could not finish it all but it still tasted really good reheated.  The dessert basically sealed the deal here.  They had the coconut covered soft moochi (that is usually only available in 1 flavour at T&T) but they gave us mango flavoured ones with real mango inside, it was delicious!  They also gave us red bean soup and sesame dumplings.  Total came to approximately $140, totally worth it.  I'm already wondering if we'll ever be able to come back with enough people to get the king crab, which was $200.  This is FRESH king crab we're talking about here, not the frozen stuff."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place but it's not what it used to be. Even with a reservation there was confusion with table placement. If you are timid your wallet will suffer, as the manager will upsell you every step of the way. Although understandable for this kind of place, the deplorable part is that the amount of food you get is based on table headcount, regardless of the poundage of your selected seafood.  Though pricy, the food is decent with their lobster/crab prepared four ways, etc. I'm also a sucker for mango mochi which is served at the end of the meal. However, it's loud and crowded, and service is rushed with minimal consideration especially at peak hours. Overall a disappointing experience given its legacy, with a hefty side of buyer's remorse as you go home wondering if it was worth what you spent (it was not)."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend visited Omei last night, upon arrival it was very busy because of Chinese New Year, so we waited about 30 mins for a table for 2.  The hostess was very nice and aplogized for the long wait. We sat down took a quick look at the menu, but we both craved lobster, so we ordered the lobster \"special\" two 1.5 lobsters seasoned with ginger and scallion for $80. About 10 mins later the food came out hot and fresh and we dug in. Food was very delicious!!! Although it was on the pricey side (two drinks and lobster special with everything included came to $119)  Its okay though as I dont mind splurging once in awhile, overall quality was good. I would deffinately visit again.. maybe try something new next time :)"}
{"text":"4.5 STARS  Most people here seems to be enamoured with their lobsters, but my favourites here are the king crab, live spotted prawns, geoduck, and \"buddha jump over the wall\" soup.  Some of this stuff isn't even on the menu, so I'm glad that I've got my unspoken Chinese customer hookups.  Some of these products are seasonal and have limited availability.  Usually, the wait staff will only tell the Chinese customers because they just naturally assume that other people wouldn't be into it.  Alaskan King crab:   This is usually prepared by steaming the legs and deep frying the body in a light batter.  I personally prefer this to lobster because I find crab meat to be sweeter and more delicate.  Also look at that monstrosity of a crustacean!  Eating it makes me feel like I've just defeated a sea monster.  Live spotted prawns:   These are plucked from their tanks, blanched quickly, and served up whole with a dipping sauce (sweet soy sauce).  The preparation is simple but fresh shrimps are infinitely superior to its dead cousins in terms of texture and flavour.  There is no good way to explain it.  I guess the only thing better would be to fish them out of the sea yourself and cook them on the beach.  Geoduck:   These giant clams can be very intimidating because of their resemblance to a certain part of the male anatomy.   Those who can get over it will be able to enjoy one of the most sought after delicacies native to Canada.  The geoduck sashimi served at a Japanese restaurants are frozen before hand but O Mei have live ones that they prepare upon ordering.  It's crisp, sweet, and very refreshing.  I wish they would serve it with freshly grated wasabi rather than the kind made from powder.  \"Buddha Jump Over the Wall\" This is an extremely luxurious soup slow-cooked over numerous hours with ingredients like abalone, sharkfin, sea cucumber, conpoy, fish maw, Chinese ham, ginseng, and etc.  This is the ultimate high-end comfort food for me.  The broth is hearty and full of seafood umami.  However, those who are not into Cantonese style soups might find it unimpressive and fishy.  Interesting trivia: \"Buddha jump over the wall\" is the world's most expensive soup; one version in England sells for approximately $190 per person.  The one at O Mei is usually between $35 - $70 per person depending on the season.  As much as I love Omei, I withheld half a star for certain details.  The service here is great for a Chinese restaurant; the staff checks up on you regularly and switches your plate when they are full of discarded shells.  This place is busy all the time, so make sure to make reservations.  It's even a good idea to tell them exactly what you want (including the size) on the phone so that they won't try to tell you they've run out and coax you into ordering something more expensive after you arrive."}
{"text":"Average seafood, nothing special.  Any restaurant can matchup with them with a lot less.  There are a lot of up sale with the king crab 4 ways but we did not wanted since we are a party of 2.  It may be worth it we you have party of 4 or more.  We got the lobster(HK style), two soft shell crab, fish fillet and sauteed snow pea shoots with garlic.  The lobsters and soft shell crab were not that good at all.  The lobster did not had the fresh sweet nature taste maybe it was not fresh or alive before cooking.  The soft shell crab also not fresh, oily and unsavory taste.  The fish fillet and snow pea shoots were at par with other Chinese restaurants.  Overall, it's upscale prices is not at par with the food."}
{"text":"Excellent place for EARLY morning dim sum with friends or family. This place does get busy on weekends and holidays unless you have your way and get your table fast. These are not cart served dim sum so dont expect ladies pushing carts and yelling your dishes. They have excellent desserts if you want to start on that first."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good here!  This place seems to be a family favourite among those looking for big piles of seafood, hot pots or standard Chinese fare.   The food is good, we tried a number of western style Chinese dishes, ranging from lemon chicken to fried rice to wonton soup, all were better than your average Panda Express or Manchu wok. Everything tasted fresh and not overly greasy or salty. The flavours were good, the sauces tend to be on the sweet side.   We saw the servers bring out some giant lobsters and crabs for their diners to see before they were cooked and people enjoyed taking photos with these crustaceans which would soon be their meals. The cooked seafood looked great, from crab to lobster to whole fish, it all looked appetizing and was tempted to ask a neighboring table for a sample!   The restaurant  is decently sized, the tables are large but there are a lot of them which makes it hard to get up and out of your seat. It's not particularly clean but certainly not dirty and could probably use an update. The chairs and tables are wobbly and old looking.   The service is a bit abrupt, we found one of the ladies serving us to be a bit rude however the food came out quickly and when we asked for water, extra cutlery/plates, it all came out quickly. We asked about the lobster and the one server was a bit pushy and tried to up-sell where possible which isn't a very appealing quality at a restaurant.   Overall I'd come back if someone else was paying, its decent standard Chinese food which caters to a western and Asian population.   One of our party has a severe peanut allergy which they were able to accommodate, which is always a good thing and harder to find with more authentic Asian places where peanuts and nuts are staple ingredients."}
{"text":"So what if Flava Flav was more like your friendly Chinese uncle and he also happened to serve you amazing lobster dishes??  Well that would be a rough approximation of what it'd be like to dine at the incredible Omei!!!  I was lucky enough to attend Jen K's epic Lobster UYE and I have to say every dish served was a flavourful masterpiece of Chinese seafood cuisine.  To begin our server brought out the main guests of honour on a large platter who were two outrageously humongous lobsters with claws the size of saucers!  Some of us pet and prodded the  alien-esque crustaceans as we bid them farewell.   I started to get a little teary eyed and wondered if I could continue to corroborate in this massacre when the waiter swooped in and dissappeared with our \"guests\" with a cheerful remark of \"see you later\"  :,(  Well it didn't take long for the mourning to end because once those magnificent dishes came out, oh my goodness it was heavenly!   Lobsters served in a parade of flavourful incarnations, with garlic and variously succulent sauces, deep fried, with their brain bits in stir fried rice and in an egg custard...DELICOUS!!  Oh man I'm karmically screwed!!  But hey at least I wasn't eating at Red Lobster, that would be doubly tragic!  Oh yeah and did I mention there is mango mochi and donuts for dessert! Are you kidding me!!!  The President of Omei is the wonderfully enthusiastic Ringo, who will win your heart (and stomach) of course with his delightful sing-song charms and the A-M-A-Z-I-N-G seafood.  Mr Ringo entertained with his Cantonese \"raps\" about the lobster and dessert dishes and was even cool enough to sing some Bee Gees tunes for us!  What a showman!!! Vegas is missing a star, and how lucky for Richmond Hill to have him!  If Chinese seafood is your thing then please, please bring your appetite and a lobster bib (thank you Jennifer ;P)  and get ready for a fabulous night of entertainment for you and your tastebuds at the incompareable Omei!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent especially the lobster dishes. However when I went there with a friend their menu is all in Chinese and my friend and I could not read the menu because we don't read or speak Chinese. We have asked for an English menu but the server said they didn't have one! ?! So we told him what we wanted and he pretty much did the ordering for us. The dishes were pretty good however I would recommend you go with someone who speaks or read chinese because it would be a challenge to order otherwise."}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant, and popular as well for those celebrating something or just want to eat out at a nice place with friends and family. I know this is a seafood restaurant but we ordered mostly non-seafood dishes. The Peking Duck was crispy and they were generous with the sides that accompanied it, although the crepes could have been a bit hotter. The rest of the dishes were nice as well and the portions are generous. The last part of the meal consists of dessert - two soups and two types of rice balls (red bean soup & mango riceball, don't know what the other two are). Service is very attentive and friendly, they offered to give us more dessert soup if we wanted more."}
{"text":"We have an oversea visitor who comes almost once a month. And back by popular demands of the family, we always got to Omei monthly with a party of 9+ people.  I have lost count of how many giant Alaskan King crab and arms length lobsters we have ever have, BUT ... We have never been disappointed.  The carbs and lobsters are usually presented (still alive) before it goes back to the kitchen.  Truthfully, I feel very much sorry for them. They usually face each other and probably saying \"Dude ... We are so screwed\" (assuming they speak the same language).  After a stunting brief moment they turn into 2-5 variation dishes.  Steamed legs with garlic with vermicelli and green onions, deep fried with garlic and pepper, soup with garlic and etc, steam/fried omelet with garlic, and last but not least, fried rice / noodles with garlic. Yessss usually those two suckers is spread across 5 dishes and yessss with stinky garlic.  Although presentation isn't like the ones you see from other places ... Ya know, one lobster piece stacked on top of each other that everyone and their auntie has it on their Facebook (wait, why do you have your aunt as friends on FB????) nevertheless, it's still very consistency tasty and obviously fresh! (One reason why they present then alive before hand - yes, me don't like :()  the dishes here are extremely authentic.  Prices is ... You know it. Not cheap :) but paying cash will let you save the taxes loll.  The only compliant is that it's a bit dirty by the kitchen, main walk ways, the bar (no one use it), and definitely the kitchen. Sauces, greasy sauces or spilled everywhere and when you are walking into the washroom you'll need to hold onto dear life or else you'll fall face down onto the ground. Just a hint :) oh btw - never gotten sick from this restaurants so it's nice to know the food is clean ;)    Highlight of the visit: Quick turn around and food deliveries.  Desserts that for some reasons can last weeks after fridge'ing it at home.  Food (Taste): 5/5 Food (Presentation): 4/5 Kitchen (Delivery Speed): 5/5 Service: 5/5 - probably cuz we pay big bucks Ambiance: 2/5 - dirty washroom. #1 or 2 before your meal :) Fun Factor: 4/5 - they let you take pictures and hold the food before cooking them lol"}
{"text":"This restaurant should be pronounced \"O My\" for two reasons. It is literally the best lobster dish I have ever had in my life. And it can also be a pretty big hit to your wallet.  When we first arrived; we were greeted by the owner who went on about the king crab 7 different ways. It sounded delicious, but past experiences have taught me to ask the price. I was floored when I heard the price and immediately told my wife, \"NO\". He then went on to describe the lobster 4 ways, which also sounded good until I heard the price. We arrived around 6:00pm and the crab and lobster tanks were full. So full that we couldn't count all of the crabs in the tank. By the time we left, there were only 4 crabs left in the tank. It seemed like they were bringing out a live crab or large lobster for every other tables approval except ours.  We settled on a 3 lb. lobster with 2 side dishes. The lobster dish was cooked with ginger and scallions using a very high heat. The shells had some scorch marks on them and the lobster meat was nice and crispy. This dish was way better than any other steamed lobster dish. I normally only go after the large pieces of meat when having lobster or crab, but this dish was so good that I went after every little bit of meat I could find. If I thought that it wouldn't embarrass my wife, I would have licked the plate clean. The two side dishes we got ( sweet-n-sour pork and eggplant) were of average quality and price for a Chinese restaurant, or at least it seemed that way when compared to the wonderful lobster dish. By the time we left, I was asking my wife to see if any of her friends wanted to join us on our next visit to O Mei. Even if they don't, we will definitely be driving back to Toronto so we can eat at this place again. Next time, I will make sure I am mentally prepared for either the lobster or crab."}
{"text":"Lobster 5 ways!  Really?  I can prepare a Lobster that many different styles?!   Thanks to all my fellow Yelpers for their support, I can finally try Omei's \"Famous\" Lobster 5 ways. Along with a Group of 12 hungry Yelpers, we able to order 2 huge Lobsters that weight 16 lbs together.    What a feast!  - Steamed  - Stir Fried with Maggie Sauce  - Deep Fried  - Fried Rice with Brain - Steamed Egg Custard with Brain    The steamed method was my favourite as it really enhanced the freshness of the lobster.  Maybe I am a perfectionist or I am just on diet!    After we all feasted on the Lobster, then we were presented with 5 different kinds of desserts:  - Purple Red Bean Sweet Soup - Green Bean Taro Sago Sweet Soup - Mango Mochi  - Deep Fried Egg White Chinese Souffle - Black Sesame Balls - that looks like eyes   With great food and awesome companions, my Omei experience here is definitely a 4 star! Please just order Lobster here or even the King Crab if you can afford that.   Just stay away from other cook dishes... I am warning you now!    Pro-Tips: - Bring cash, you may get a discount - Make a reservation, as this place is busy - Ask owner to sing for you, extra entertaining - BYOB, maybe for some food pairing?  *3000th review all made possible by the help of the Yelp community, without my fellow yelpers I would never have a chance to experience what I had at Omei and other awesome places!"}
{"text":"Come here with a bunch of Yelper foodies. Had 2 huge 8 pound lobsters! You can never have too much lobster but this time I met my match.  At the end of the feast, I was done! The food was worthy of a 5 star from me.  The owner Ringo is super friendly and sang a few melodies to entertain us.  Needless to say, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the mushroom fried rice for carry out. It was okay, nothing to remember. The ambiance seemed busy even atfter 9 in the night."}
{"text":"A neat, brightly lit, and elegant place for family dining and functions too.  However, been there only for take-outs since its currently the most convenient thing for my kids.  Everything we've ever ordered has been very scrumptious, delectably fresh, and tastefully balanced without overwhelming the ingredients.    Our current faves: (a) Buddha's Delight ($8.50) - may seem like Chop Suey but has more variety of mushrooms in it; (b) Mushroom Fried Rice ($5.75) -has more than mushrooms in it and its so filling; (c) O-Mei House Special Fried Noodles ($9.50) - has the biggest shrimps in any noodle dish I've ever had recently from other places and the fat udon-like noodles are so meaty.  Huge slices of chicken and vegetables, its a meal by itself; (d) And how can I forget, Bbq Pork Egg Foo Yong ($6.50) - so good and filled with vegetables, meat and other great stuff.  It even comes with a generous serving of sesame sauce - sooo good; or was it meant for the other dish I ordered with it...hmmm.   The serving sizes are generous and packed.  The taste and texture - really one of the best and at par with neighboring Ambassador Chinese Cuisine.  Service has been very nice and friendly and super fast.  And one special note: it would seem that its not any regular chinese restaurant because I don't get sick after eating (nauseous, extremely thirsty, dull senses), meaning they don't use MSG or perhaps minute amounts only.  Yey!  I can't wait until we get ourselves seated there and try the Peking Duck and Lobsters they're very popular for.  Their menu is enough to make my mouth water for more since they have quite a number of not too common dishes.  Check it out:  http://omeirestaurant.com/Downloaddoc.aspx?file=OMEITAKEOUT_P2.pdf    Definitely a place worth going to and will recommend to my equally foodie friends.  I should come back and write another review with the sit-in dining experience. ;)"}
{"text":"Okay, the food was okay. It wasn't great, but the food was worth 3.5 stars.  My biggest problem was the service. We ordered five dishes. 4/5 came out properly. We ordered a sweet-and-spicy Pork Ribs and it came out to deep-fried battered pepper and onion pork chops. We took it anyways since it looked good. Then they brought out a Chicken dish after we got all 5.... we only ordered five. We told them that it was not ours VERY SPECIFICALLY, and then they brought out another chicken dish...  Other than that, it was fine."}
{"text":"Great place! I always come here for the giant lobster cooked in many different ways."}
{"text":"The service here was god awful and the waitstaff were blatantly racist against non Asians.   I had made a reservation for two large tables. I called a week in advance for a Sunday dinner. It was an early reservation for dinner as well and when we showed up the place was fairly empty. They showed us the huge lobsters and then it all just went downhill from there.   FOOD: We ordered the set menus for each table where the lobster is cooked 4 or 5 ways. It was very disappointing. The steamed lobster had small shell fragments throughout, the deep fried lobster was fried to shit - one of the claws had little to no meat inside. The lobster soup was so thickened with cornstarch we couldn't taste anything else. The lobster rice was dry and the portion was small. We question if the kitchen even cooked the same lobster they showed us at the beginning. We actually needed to order three more plates off the menu to satisfy the table - these dishes were also not done well. Very poor value and quality of food.   SERVICE: The waitstaff did not bring us water, failed to bring us tea, did not clear our plates throughout the dinner such that by the end of the meal we literally had 36 dirty plates on our table. I asked the waitress to clear the plates and she took away three plates without acknowledging the request. Incredibly rude even for a Chinese restaurant. We brought a cake and they didn't bring us plates for that either, once they gave us the plates, they didn't bring us forks. It was TERRIBLE throughout the entire night! Even when the restaurant was empty at the beginning!  Not to mention this gem: one of the tables received red bean dessert, and the other table did not receive any dessert, so when we brought it up to the waitstaff they told us they would pack up the dessert for the table and give it to us as take out! Excuse me, paying $500 a table, it's preposterous to suggest such a ridiculous thing so they could turn over our table. If there is dessert that we paid for, you serve it. It's not our fault the staff did not serve us in a timely fashion. They tried to rush is out of there without even serving half the guests the full meal!   In addition to the food and service, the management here is OPENLY racist towards anyone who is not Chinese. The menu is in Chinese and if you ask for an English menu they will tell you that they don't do \"gwai Lo\"menus because they don't know anything. The waiter literally declared this statement to the entire table when he put down the menus. This was Very disrespectful considering we had Caucasian people sitting AT the table when this is occurred. I read another review about this happening to other customers but didn't think that this would happen to us. Clearly they don't care about their customers and there's a pattern here of disrespect towards certain groups of people.   Given the price we paid for dinner, it was overall just awful. It was about $500 per table. Even if the dinner was $10 a person, it was still shockingly poor. Never again. I hate writing this but people need to know about what a negative experience I had here. Please support a business that will respect you as a customer and that does not engage in racist activities."}
{"text":"Food was very good and the first time I had an Alaskan king crab whole but the price tag did not correspond to the overall experience.  Funny, so I walk into the restaurant with my Caucasian husband and children and they give me 100% chinese menus.  I cannot help think that they did this on purpose so they can recommend their most expensive crab and lobsters.  Fine, that is what I had a taste for anyway, but I was told the lobster was $168 and crab $268 4 ways but weight dependent.  I tried the crab because I never had Alaskan whole and fresh, but was thinking that would be too much food for 2 adults and 2 non crab eating children.  The manager/owner brought out a small crab and told me 248 but he was going to see if he could find smaller.  Then he suggested a meat dish for the kids and a veggie to add to the mix, so great.  With drinks, tax and tip, the bill was 450+.  Although we enjoyed the taste, the crab legs were much smaller than expected and required much work for the meat. I can't help but think they gave us a small crab for the two of us for the same price of a larger crab if we would have more people.  I felt bad since I told my hubby it would be very little work.  They should be more upfront with pricing telling you the weight of the seafood and the price per pound then charging a surcharge for the set styles. I keep wondering if they gave me even a smaller crab than the one they showed.  For goodness sake, when I saw the bill and looked at the decor and realized they charged me for a white rice for the kids they said the would comp because the kids would not eat anything else, it lowered my rating. Saving grace was their comped desserts. I am sure their are a lot of these restaurants in the area with much better decor and hopefully better value!"}
{"text":"(Ken K. previously stated this is (was?) a shanghainese restaurant.  i don't know about its past, but far as i know--from couple years ago, this place appears more of a cantonese-style/seafood restaurant to me.)  my cousin (a local) brought me to this place for their \"giant lobster 4 ways\" set: 1) steamed claws w/soy sauce, scallion & clear vermicelli; 2) sautee tail w/supreme soysauce; 3) \"harbor (haven?) style\" (high-heat sautee w/deep fried shallots, garlic, spice & etc) legs; 4) fried rice w/tomalley (the green stuff, i was told that is liver).  not only that, they have at least 4 kinds of desserts to choose from, which are all of superior quality and atypical for a chinese restaurant. on usual menu is a kind of sweet soup, glutinous rice balls w/black sesame paste inside, mango mochi, and \"go lick dou sa\" (beaten egg white w/red bean paste inside, sprinkled w/sugar; it's soft like a souffle).  they also serve king crabs along with the gigantic lobsters nightly, but it may be a good idea to make reservations on busy nights/weekends. i'm not particularly crazy about seafood to begin with, but if i'm in the mood of some good dishes, i'll come here. regular dishes is about $10-15 each, but if you go for the giant lobster set, that can easily jack up your bill right past the $200 mark."}
{"text":"Have you ever heard a Lobster Rap in Cantonese and English... and then a Crab Rap in Cantonese and English? What about a Dessert Rap? Has a Chinese guy named Ringo ever sang you The Bee Gees? No? Then you should probably get your behind to Richmond Hill (far, I know) and check out Omei! Until you've heard Ringo sing, you haven't lived. Period.  Last night was an EPIC UYE (holla Jennifer K!) wherein we had the famous giant lobsters done 4 ways along with other delicious Cantonese sides. The lobsters are about 8lbs each. They weight considerably more than I did when I was born. They bring you lobster deep fried, stir friend, in fried rice and straight up broiled over vermicelli with green onions and garlic. The latter being my fave. Deep fried wasn't bad, either. I mean, when is deep fried bad? Never.  This place is a hike from the downtown. But it is worth it, downtown loyalists, I pinky swear.   NB: You have to have a group of about 10 people for the lobster feast."}
{"text":"Since everybody seems to be invading Canada (i.e. writing generic short paragraphed circa pre-Elite 2005 Yelp reviews, now that Yelp has officially crossed the northern border) I'm gonna hop on the Maple Leaf bandwagon and start off with one too.  Omei, or more accurately, pronounced Er Mei in Mandarin, is actually a the name of a mountainous region in Sichuan province, China  beautiful flickr pics: http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=%E5%A8%A5%E5%AA%9A&w=all  The last time I was at Omei restaurant was probably close to 13 years ago. Unless things have changed, this is/was a Shanghainese style restaurant, and is in a strip mall that also has a pharmacy and a supermarket.  There were a few decent items here for lunch/brunch, particularly soymilk, sticky rice rolls (fan tuan) and a nicely done ja jiang mien (brothless noodle in bean sauce) although the noodles were not made in house. My grandma loved coming here as it was close by and they did those favorites of hers fairly consistently.  But circa 2003, family members (those who hold Canadian passports) felt this place went down the slopes and have not returned as much. There are arguably better and newer places that do better Shanghainese fare within driving distance."}
{"text":"This place is the worst food I have ever eaten .don't go or order. Garbage. We had delivery late cold embarrassing quality it was terrible. The wonton soup was the only part of the order was edible.wasted 55 dollars .get your sh_t together O M."}
