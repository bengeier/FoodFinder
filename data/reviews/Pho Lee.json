{"text":"Pho Lee is a 1 star compared to every other Pho place that I have ever been to.  I have eaten Pho from at least 10 different establishment.

The Pho is just so watered down which dampens the flavor so much to where it is a water soup with flavor added.  I ordered the special Pho, with all meats, tripe, and tendon.  I didn't receive any tendon and had 1 piece of tripe.  The meat was literally half in quantity compared to every other Pho meal I have eaten of its size.

Summary:  the cost is too expensive for the unmistakably low quality pho.  It's just bad Pho.

I will not return and I do not advise anyone tries the places."}
{"text":"Had seen the sign for Pho for a while. Was eagerly waiting for the opening as it is just down the street from my work. Unfortunately I will not be returning after my first visit today. 

I walked in around noon and asked for a table and placed my order for the most basic pork pho on the menu. There was only one other party seated so I figured it would not take long to get my food.

Three other tables came in after me and were seated and they all placed their orders. Fast forward 40 minutes and I had seen every party that had came in after me along with two to-go orders receive their orders and I still had yet to get my order. 

Meanwhile the two servers working kept avoiding eye contact with me, it's a tiny place so that was really awkward. Finally the other server who did not take my order asked me if someone had taken my order yet, I gave her an obvious annoyed look like no sh!t, I've only been sitting here for 40 minutes.

Also while this was happening the table behind me kept complaining about their order being wrong.

Finally the time was 12:50, almost an hour after walking in, I decided to leave and I told the server to cancel my order and instead of apologizing she seemed almost relieved and said \"ok\". As I walked out the owner just stared me down as if I was the a-hole for leaving."}
{"text":"Great little Pho restaurant. The Cha Gio was amazing, wrapped it in a little lettuce with cilantro and mintn delicious! Had the Special Pho which has steak, tendon, flank and beef meatballs, great as well! Its just a small little place, very unassuming, but overall has been great!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Hot and Sour soup!!! Incredible broth.  Veggies, shrimp and scallops all very fresh. Spring rolls were great as well. VERY nice owners,obviously take great pride in their food. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great service, Great food, and a Great place to eat! I recommend it for a nice lunch or dinner.

* This review was from my 12 year old son."}
{"text":"The service was exceptional, and the food matches the service!  Packed for takeout I ordered pho.  I was equally impressed at how well everything was separated and packed to go.  It's not easy with Pho, but they pulled it off perfectly!

The food is quite good.  I would recommend it to anybody looking for fairly priced Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"I recently stopped by for lunch to use my local flavor voucher that expired. I noticed how small and cramped the tables are walking in. An older lady greeted me. She was friendly but I had a very hard time understanding her. Because of her limited English, I pointed to the item on the menu and specifically asked to leave out the cilantro. I also ordered boba. She came back fairly quickly with my order but she came back with spicy beef soup! By the way she never brought out water, which is a good thing as you'll find out. She was sweet and said she'll be back with the correct order. However, when she set the bowl down, I noticed she forgot my request for no cilantro. Ughhh! I didn't want to be a major pain so I spooned them out. She also forgot my boba. The pho that I ordered was mediocre. The place I usually go to is Pho Avina and this place did not come close to the richness of flavor compared to Pho Avina. So I got done and I didn't even ask for water because I just wanted to get the heck out of there. Table was sticky, she didn't check to see if I needed anything, she messed up on my order, it was a little warm inside the restaurant (not good considering I'm consuming hot liquid on a hot summer day). So I got up already knowing I will not be coming back to this restaurant and took out my voucher to pay. I saw her grabbing a random fork at the front counter to fish out some lime slices from a pitcher to put into customers waters. When I showed her my voucher, she called an older man and he looked at the voucher and immediately said they couldn't take it. I said the paid value is what I'm using. He still didn't understand and said it was \"weird\" that none of his customers had used an expired voucher. So I read the fine print to him. He shook his head while looking at me suspiciously and proceeded to say he was going to make an exception this time.  Gee thanks! I literally ran out. To add insult to injury, I had digestive issues few hours later!! So let me review why I would never go back to this place. Food isn't that good. It's not very sanitary. Customer service...there is none. It's over priced. It's messy and disorganized. I was hoping to find that hole in the wall I can everyone about but not today!"}
{"text":"This was mine and my fiancé's second time here. The first time here the service was average because they just opened and were getting situated which is understandable, then we came back a few weeks later to try it again, the Pho was way more greasy, and the service was more poor, they forgot to give us a plate with bean sprouts and greens so when asked for one they did a half fast job and gave us one plate for both me and my fiancé and the plate was half empty, also we ordered Thai teas and it was only 3/4 filled. We have been to many Pho places in the valley and worldwide and by far this is the worst we have encountered, we are not coming back even though we waited a long time for a Pho place by our house. Next time I'm driving the 20 minutes to go to Pho Avina which is still one of the best in the valley and not to mention have excellent service."}
{"text":"Worst Vietnamese food I've ever had. Come on if the service is bad, the food should at least be edible. We waited for this place to open for Iverson 6 months. 2 thumbs down!!"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying the food was good. The service on the other hand was rather uncoordinated. The waitresses were moving around rather confused and we're taking tables wrong items.

We ordered a number 15 (pho with rare steak, flank steak, tendon, tripe, and meatball) and a 31 (stir fried chicken with lemongrass and mixed veggies). We received a number 17 and what looked like chicken fried rice (no vegetables).  When I asked the waitress about the number 15 she took it to check to see if it was right, and returned it with only adding 3 pieces of meatball. 

Will I go back? Most likely, but would recommend waiting a few weeks for them to get their service in order."}
{"text":"I love the chicken pho and their potstickers. My family can't get enough, we've been there two times in the last week! It's so good, it keeps you coming back for more. Plus the owners are very nice and friendly as well. I highly recommend the thai tea and the thai tea boba. We are so fortunate to have found this place and I know we will be loyal customers there for a long time to come!"}
{"text":"The herbs that were brought with the pho were not fresh and the spring rolls were stale"}
{"text":"I love this place! Close to home and staff is friendly. They just opened and just like any new business it takes a little time to perfect! The food is great! Nothing to complain about here and I've had all the best pho from this state and every state I've traveled and this place does not disappoint! No menu online yet to place a pick up order so I'm going to post a picture of there current one."}
{"text":"We are slowly trying most Vietnamese restaurants in the north half of the metro.  Pho Lee is solid but not spectacular.  The menu has what you'd expect without any unique offerings that I could see.  The food came fast but the check lingered way too long so we finally got up and stood in front until they appeared from the back. Very friendly staff.  I wouldn't be disappointed to have this place in my neighborhood but probably wouldn't drive distance for it."}
{"text":"I come here all the time with my boyfriend. We ecspecially love the bun boe hue soup. We love the flavor of it as well as how perfectly its prepared. Please never change it!!! Youre all doing a great job. We are without a doubt impressed with the amazing customer service  and great tasting meals!!! Thanks Pho Lee!!!"}
{"text":"New Vietnamese establishment. 
Ordered Vietnamese egg rolls which were greasy as an appetizer.
Pho ga was watery and full flavor was missing and greasy also.
Would not recommend."}
{"text":"We had the pho ga, shrimp rolls, and a banh mi sandwich. One of, if not the best, banh mi I've ever had. Very friendly staff and quick service"}
{"text":"Great pho; best around. Always very fast take out service. It is reasonably priced and yelp is making me write a longer review so blah blah blah blah. Go eat there"}
{"text":"Saw that this place was finally open. Been keeping an eye out for awhile. It was definitely worth the wait. Order the filet of steak and meatball Pho and the Xhicoen Pho. Both were excellent. Very clear broth with deep flavors. Staff was super nice and great service."}
{"text":"Just started getting into Pho, and this place is incredible. Good prices too."}
{"text":"Apparently I imposed on the owners of this restaurant today when I went there to give them my money. God forbid. A mistake I won't be making again."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time today. The service was slow but they were short on staff. Great soup and I really liked the soup. Tasty and not too salty. I recommend this place. I think you will like it."}
{"text":"Really good Pho place. I ordered the Thai tea, shrimp and pork summer roll and the S1 Pho (minus the tendon and tripe). Service was really quick!!! The summer roll came with a peanut sauce. The Pho came with jalapeños, basil, bean sprouts and a lime. I doctored the pho with hoisin sauce and sriracha. Good place to stop in for a Pho craving. They had rice dishes and banh mih on the menu too, so something to look forward to for next time!"}
{"text":"This place needs to be gutted and renovated. Tables are broken, staff is rude and there is no sense of atmosphere whatsoever. I was hoping the food would be amazing but I couldn't stay in there any longer and left. It might have potential in the future if the right actions are taken."}
{"text":"Picked up Pho and Boba for the first time. Ordered Pho Tai as suggested to go and a Thai Tea Boba. Food came out fast and was hot. The tea came in a plastic cup and was not sealed and so it spilled all over my hands by the time I made it to the car. The Pho is good, not great. It had 6 pieces of chicken, which is meager for a huge cup of Pho.
The Boba Tea was great, not too sweet and enough Tapioca. 
Honestly, I have had much better Pho, but it's around the corner of my house. I'll give it another chance with a different order.

As of the beginning of 2017 they only take cash, which can be very inconvenient. I hardly ever carry cash and was lucky to have some on me. It will be a deal breaker for me to have to get cash to buy here."}
{"text":"The new spot! My friend said after the first time we ate there, the food and the service were amazing! The jasmine tea was the best."}
{"text":"Love the food and love the people!  Be adventurous....put yourself in their hands and ask what they recommend.  I've tried many dishes I might not otherwise have ordered and have always been delighted."}
{"text":"Today was opening day, and it was delicious!!

I had #38 Bun Cha Gio, Thit Nuong (Egg Roll & Grilled Pork w/Rice Noodle) and it was one of the best executions of this dish that I have ever had. Saying that they didn't skimp on the pork would be an understatement - there was A LOT of it and perfectly prepared.
 
My husband: Soup #15 Pho Tai, Nam, Gan, Sach, Bo Vien (Rare Steak, Well-done Flank, Tendon, Tripe, Meatball) and also said that there was plenty of meat in a superior broth. There was actually so much in the bowl that he asked for more broth which they served in a separate bowl at not extra charge.

Our friend: Soup #24 Pho Tom (Shrimp Noodle Soup) and like out other two dishes, there was an abundance of shrimp. And something that I'd never seen before - broccoli & cauliflower!! He had never had Vietnamese food of any kind before and after this experience he's decided he's a fan. 

When the boss visited our table, she told us that soon they're going to be adding Vietnamese desserts and Bahn Mi (sandwiches) to the menu in the coming weeks.

All three dishes were $9.00 each, and an excellent value for the money and we look forward to becoming regular customers!"}
{"text":"This place is really close to my work so I go for lunch and they always have my food out quickly. I love Pho and the special Pho they have is delicious. It's a family business and they make you feel like one of their family members. They always greet me with a smile. Their Pho is delicious and the Boba tea is awesome! I recommend this place to anyone looking for some delicious Pho."}
{"text":"I was short on time and  in a hurry to go and show a client at home. I was starving, it had been a very long day and I stopped in to get something warm to eat. I was greeted at the door and when I shared with them I needed to leave within 15 minutes they offered me the Pho special. The portion size was great I got to eat and take the rest with me. The jalapeno slice added the perfect amount of heat and the soup was delicious and fresh. Everyone involved in the service was very kind and appreciative for my business. They shared with me their specials that were coming up and how to get in touch with them for pickup! If you're in a hurry or you're starving and you're not sure where to go Pho Lee  is great and will treat you with respect."}
{"text":"Four stars; we are happy that there is a pho place so close to us! It took awhile to open, but I'm glad it did. Because they're new, I'm sure they're still working out the kinks with the menu because they don't have an option for just tofu/veggie pho...but they seem to be accommodating! I just asked if I could have tofu instead of meat and they happily obliged. Broth is delicious and comforting- I ate the whole thing and so did my husband (he had the rare beef pho). The price is reasonable, too!"}
{"text":"The pho was hot and the service friendly.
However, the broth was the saltiest I've ever tasted (don't remember actually having salty Pho before) and some of the condiments were missing (how do you forget the lime?).

I'll probably give this another go in the future, but hopefully the broth doesn't taste like Campbell's beef broth with added salt."}
{"text":"Loved the Thai Tea!! Loved the Pho!! This place is a small family owned restaurant and it is really good! The owner is so sweet and nice he suggested the Thai tea and said If you don't like it I'll pay for it, and it's the best Thai tea I've had! Super Delish! We will be back soon"}
{"text":"Coming from Hawaii and San Francisco I appreciate good pho and this didn't let me down. Great food."}
{"text":"I'm glad that my husband and I comes to this New Pho Lee to try it out, the Pho is not bad at all, I would rate 4 stars for them but the only thing holding me back of rating 4 stars was they'll need to improve their mints and bean sprouts plate, need to be more fresher than what we had today! Could be better than today but that's ok . They're new just opened! We're give them another chance to get it right! Thanks to anyone that read this review."}
{"text":"Broth base is hearty and the right balance of flavor. Spring roll not the neatest but what it lacked in presentation it made up in taste, delish all around. So glad they are now open!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place ! Best pho in town , perfect soup
always fresh vegetables, fresh broth actually I'm not gonna lie everything is perfect!
The couple who owns it always welcomes us with love 

The best"}
{"text":"Food is great, service is terrible. We got our meal and had to ask for water to be brought to the table, no offer for drinks prior to that. There is an older man who works there who is so friendly and sweet, and he is the only saving grace other than the quality of the food, which is actually pretty good. But great food is not everything. Tried to pay, all staff were in the back and it took almost 10 minutes. I'm not normally one who complains but I left fairly frustrated with their lack of caring for the customers. They are so close to my house that I wish I could say I'd be back."}
{"text":"Restaurants have to be very bad or very good for me to write a review.  This one was very GOOD!  Located on the corner of a little strip mall it's nothing fancy but the food is pure and fresh.  The couple that runs it were so accommodating.  We are vegans and first glance at the menu made me worried.  There wasn't any dairy but everything had meat.  I was so pleased to hear they would modify anything on the menu because it's all made fresh, no preservatives or MSG.  We ordered spring rolls, noodles and pho.  The substituted beef broth with vegetable broth.  All the dishes were full of flavor and presented beautifully."}
{"text":"Lived in the area and such a short drive, so we tried Pho Lee out. Wife had the BBQ beef w/spring roll, good portions and all the vegi condiments. As for myself, I ordered the beef pho, also generous portion of noodles and the broth was deelish. The pho was also accompanied by vegi condiments which were very fresh. Would I go back? You betcha, thanks Pho Lee!!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time there and I was needing some comfort food as I was not feeling well. I will say that I was happy that I was taking my order to go because either I was REALLY sick or it was VERY VERY cold in the restaurant. Regardless, the staff were friendly and I didn't have to wait very long for my order. I had the special that day which was chicken and shrimp pho for $9. I did have to add some seasonings to the broth when I got home because it lacked a little something. I was bummed that I only had 5 small shrimp in my order but the chicken and rice noodles were good. All in all the food was ok. I have had better, but I will give this place another try as maybe they were just having an off night. Plus I want to know whether or not I was really sick or it really is that cold in the restaurant all the time."}
{"text":"No. 

Got takeout Bahn Mi and Spring Rolls. The rolls were supposed to be shrimp and pork, but we're only shrimp. They smelled like rotten shrimp, at that. It looked like they were made days ago, the rice paper was stiff. I couldn't even eat them.  The sandwiches were slathered in mayo, and scarce on pork, which was not flavorful. The marinated veggies were also scarce and bland. I finished a third of the sandwich and just decided to take the loss. 

I cannot attest to the pho, because u didn't try it, and won't be back. But if you are looking for sn excellent Vietnamese Bahn mi, do yourself a favor and go to Bahn Mi Bistro nearby. They don't do pho,but what they do serve is excellent."}
{"text":"So happy I found this little gem.  Pho and spring rolls are  wonderful!  They also DO take credit or debit cards.
Owners are very nice and I highly recommend the food."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now. The first time was different than the first other wise we would not have gone back. There was flavor in the broth however it was extremely greasy and hardly any noodles came in our phone and they were different from the 15 other pho restaraunt that I've ever been to, more like flat udon noodles than rice or egg noodles that we typically get or even got the first time."}
{"text":"It was our first visit to this darling little establishment and it won't be our last!! We loved the service, which was polite and helpful. The food was prepared with great fresh ingredients, brought to the table piping hot and was delicious! My fiancé was reluctant to visit...I have tried before but tonight he was open to trying it out!! Thank goodness! It's so close to home and now that he knows the food is wonderful, we can definitely revisit or bring it home on nights we don't wanna hassle with dinner preparation! Thank you Pho Lee!!"}
{"text":"Love Pho, so definitely had to stop by the new neighborhood Vietnamese place! The soup is delicious, doesn't have that weird after taste and smell that other Places have, so can't complain, hope they stick around!  Prices are ok, wouldn't say they are cheap. Their menu is very limited which I don't really care about since the only thing I come here for is Pho anyway, will definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is ok.  We order crispy egg rolls and look like it was retried not fresh.  And a little pricey."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to eat. The food is delicious, the staff is wonderful. Takeout orders are always when when you get there. Best pho place to eat, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered this place for take out and the food was good the portion size was WAY too small for the price! Might try again but actually go into the restaurant.."}

Somewhere Bo Bites Pho Lee
Somewhere singing with me
My review stands on golden stars
And Vietnamese Pho that's oh so yummy!

Somewhere Bo Bites Pho Lee
It's there waiting for me
If I could try like on a fly!
And straight to my mouth I going yummy!


Pho Lee is a small mom/pop Pho restaurant.  They offer and serve traditional Vietnamese eats on the fly!  Service is great and when I ordered my Pho Tai; it literally was almost on my table before I sat down.  They had it on my table before my drinks!  Needless to say, that's what I would expect from any Pho restaurant; growing up that was the way Pho was made, quick and fast!  It was like that in Vietnam, why not here huh!?

As for the Pho it came with the basic condiments of sprouts, mint leaves, jalapeno, and lime.  The broth was gloriously HOT!  Which I thought at the time, finally!  I hate warm Pho broth.  It was tad bit greasy, but that added much flavor to the distinctive Pho smell and taste.  I didn't have to super size anything but felt my Pho entree was more than enough for it's size.  

In the end, I appreciate Pho Lee for what it is.  While some Vietnamese restaurants are trying out Asian fusion style; Pho Lee takes it traditional and simple to bring Vietnamese bites to North Phoenix area! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Hit up Pho Lee on my way out of town last week. As to be expected from a joint on Union Hills (as oppose to my usual 19th Ave pho adventures) the facility is clean and modern. Service is prompt and friendly. We enjoyed the spring rolls and a couple bowls of pho that came with the appropriate garnish. The soup itself was flavorful and not too greasy, which my stomach very much appreciated on my drive up north. 

Definitely a worthwhile stop if you are looking for pho in the area."}
{"text":"We live very close by and are truly delighted to have this restaurant which serves healthy fresh options! Tom is awesome and is always helpful for us to try new things on the menu. After I had surgery he helped me very much with my Pho Chicken broth by removing the items that I was a bit afraid to add (onions, etc) - (gallbladder surgery). My husband has always been more of a foody,  (Manhattan, NY)  - I am a midwestern gal and have been slower to try new foods. You won't be disappointed in trying this little restaurant."}
{"text":"Once again pleasant person that met u at the door...great place great food...if u want great pho...this is ur place....look no further...best Vietnamese food in area"}
{"text":"Horrible place,don't waste your money. The ban mi is not good. The spring rolls are filled with too much noodles and lettuce. Not visually appealing. We did not know we had to serve ourselves fountain water."}
{"text":"YUM! The hubs grabbed some standard white person pho here and brought it home for dinner. It totally hit the spot. Their broth was rich and very flavorful -- which isn't always the case when I am eating pho outside of Orange County. We also had shrimp summer rolls with peanut dipping sauce. Also bomb. Will be back for more. Easy take out!"}
{"text":"The servers were nice enough. The food was alright, nothing too grand to be honest. I feel like the portions aren't as great as some other Vietnamese eateries. It could definitely use a small makeover. The restaurant was very limited in seating and I wonder how they handle a lunch or dinner rush."}
{"text":"Staff all very nice. Food was pho-nomenal. I would suggest getting cam Bo luc lac Bahn MI and pho Tai chin. Everything is prepared within view so it's cool to see them prepare everything it really builds the anticipation. They have been open only a few days but I would like to see them last a long Tim."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place had any good reviews. This was one of the worst eating experiences we've had. Service was so slow and terrible for us and everyone around us. Our appetizer came 28 min after ordering, with our food ( one entree came 10 min after the others). I wanted a drink, and was told they didn't have time to make it. There were 3 tables. The fried tofu came completely different than the picture. I was told it is the same thing. We argued about it until I told them this picture has panko breading and an orange sauce. The dish I got was plain tofu with a brown sauce . The table next to ours had stir fried rice that wasn't stir fried. The table behind us got tripe in her chicken pho. Every table ran out of water, and the host was standing in the corner doing nothing.  Both meatball and chicken pho were tasteless, and my son's curry was not red. It was powdered gray with powder that hadn't been dissolved . There was literally nothing good. We will never be back."}
{"text":"Delicious grilled pork sandwich for only $5! Quick take-out service during lunch on a Thursday."}
{"text":"OK waited a long time for this place to get up and running and not worth the wait Pho was very greasy very weak flavor topping ( basil and so on) very sparse,We go to several other places in town that are far better won't go back"}
{"text":"Always wanted to try a Bahn Mi sandwich so followed the reviews to this place. Excellent choice. Very fresh spring roll and tasty Bahn Mi with crusty fresh bread. Good Thai tea - sweet but like the spice. Very good service and reasonable prices. Could use a little organizing especially behind the counter as customers can see that and it's concerning about cleanliness of kitchen."}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  Have been twice now, and will probably be somewhere I go very regularly from here.  The owners are the nicest people.  The first time we went, they were super friendly and attentive, making sure we were enjoying everything. When we got there the 2nd time (maybe 2-3 weeks later) they immediately remembered us.  We ordered some jasmine tea, and when she brought it out she said she made us a special tea, and hoped we liked it.  Which was super nice to begin with, but she even went way above and beyond from there.  The tea was absolutely delicious, so calming and the smell was amazing too.  She came to ask if we liked it, and we asked what it was.  She said it was a special tea her family brought over from Vietnam.  She even brought the bag out to show us, and then gave us some to take with us so we could make it at home.  SOOOO sweet and very generous.

On top of that, the food is absolutely amazing.  We had the S1 Pho both times, and it is some of the best Pho in town, no question.  And we eat pho pretty often, have been to a number of places around the valley.  The broth is so fresh and flavorful - you can really tell the vegetables and everything are super fresh.  The crispy pork potstickers are also the best I've had.  They are also super fresh, the filling in the middle is just perfect, and has more than just pork in it, its a really tasty mixture inside a really fresh dumpling.  I believe they do chicken and shrimp as well, which I plan to try, as I'd imagine they are also delicious.  The fried rice was also great. 

As if that isn't enough to make you totally love a place, then add the Boba Teas!  O-M-G. They are SOOOO good.  We had the Taro flavor the first time (which i didn't even know what that was, we just took her recommendation, and she was definitely right about it being delicious).  We had it with Lychee pearls in it.  And the 2nd time we did honeydew with blueberry pearls.  So tasty!

This place is a gem, and I highly recommend checking it out and showing these wonderful small business owners some love.  They definitely deserve it."}
{"text":"The water tasted like tap water, the pho was just ok.. The restaurant felt like a basement vibe quite good luck.."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would! This is the WORST place I've been unfortunate to visit in awhile. We brought my husband here for Father's Day because he loves pho... What a complete disappointment!! The food was decent but the service was ridiculous. The woman serving us got several orders wrong and had a horrible cavalier attitude at every turn. She destroyed our dining experience! I ordered the shrimp wonton soup, when I told her there was no shrimp she insisted it was in there and walked away. We had to get up and refill our own water because she just never came around. She was rude and neglectful, complete with eye rolling and audible scoffs. We will not be returning... Ever."}
{"text":"Fan-fucking-tastic Cha Gio (fried egg roll with shrimp and pork). Crispy and very fresh. I'd come back just for that, actually.

The pad Thai was good but felt like it was lacking something. What, I'm not sure. I added soy sauce and it improved well enough. 

My date had noodle-less pho, which meant extra extra veggies. It was SO good! I love the broth. 

Service was very slow, but the owner apologized and explained that they got a sudden influx of call ins. They were more attentive after they got out of the weeds."}
{"text":"Found a hair in my bowl today they got us a new bowl but we were still charged the full price. Been here two or three times, they are close to where we live and food was above average. Will still come back, but please pay more attention to the hygiene of your kitchen."}
{"text":"Awesome Pho !  The broth was incredibly complex , fragrant and delicious.  We will definitely be back to visit & try other items on the menu ."}
{"text":"Great food!!! The people are really friendly and the inside feels quaint. It's also really easy to order food. I had take out and it took about 7-10 minutes to get my food. I would recommend you to try the Thai tea is the best because it's sweet, milky, and has a unique earthy taste."}
{"text":"This place just opened today and we love it already! We had the #15 rare steak Pho... $9, #2 spring rolls...$3 and Thai tea $3. Excellent prices and friendly service. Cute and casual place and just minutes from home. 

Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Small, simple, and super yummy - menu only has a few items and the entire restaurant is only a few tables. It's the perfect place to grab some quick & delicious Viet food. Service was really good & prices are decent!"}
{"text":"It was like I went to Vietnam. The Pho shrimp and chicken was outstanding.  I told Tom he would see me again."}
{"text":"Much better Pho spots in town. Overpriced, dirty and service lacking. If you don't mind those it was pretty decent taste wise."}
{"text":"The first time I went to this place I was so impressed! In the soup I got the shrimp were very plump/large and the broth was AMAZING! Second time I ordered the same soup and this time the shrimp looked very questionable... It almost looked liked they had plucked shrimp from a cup of noodles and threw them in.  Super thin and tiny.  Made me gag! Was it even shrimp?? And the broth was waaay different. Will never go here again for inconsistency."}
{"text":"I was very excited with the new opening of a family owned PHO establishment near me, but after my experience here I am very disappointed and dissatisfied with the service as well as the food. To begin I ordered the most basic chicken Phó (which is pricy for a small bowl it's 9 dollars) the Phó arrived at the table and I had to ask the server to bring the condiments that are commonly served with the Phó. Once the server brought them it was a small portion of the bean sprouts ect. for which I was expected to share with my fiancé (I don't mind but I feel most establishments bring two plates instead of just 1). The pho was mediocre and it was extremely greasy just as the shredded chicken tasted over cooked. The Thai tea with boba was okay. The server never once came to check on our table either, I ran out of water and had to go get it myself from the soda machine, just as our table had no napkins in the napkin dispenser. Next time I will much rather drive an extra 10-15 mins to a Phó establishment that provides better service and food instead of driving 2 minutes around the corner for this food."}
{"text":"Most delicious stir fry and pho.  Very friendly staff! Quaint and intimate atmosphere. Definitely recommend and will frequent."}
{"text":"The service is quick , food is good and hot, good taste and seasoning with the broth. The people who own the restaurant are great people , attentive and very helpful. Would definitely recommend this establishment to anyone of my friends !"}
{"text":"Had amazing Pho! The best I've had in a long time!! It tasted delicious! Spring Rolls were great too. Very laid back atmosphere. Lady that served us was very friendly. My kids loved their Boba Teas & my Thai Tea was so good!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! I can honestly say that this place had the best fried rice I've ever had! The Pho is amazing! Even my picky son enjoyed the soup. A must try."}
{"text":"I gave this place a 4 star review because there are more pros than cons. The service was great and they brought the food out fast. The soup we ordered was really amazing. Very tasty. We both ordered the rare beef rice noodle soup. We also ordered egg rolls and those were really good as well. The restaurant is small. Definitely a hole in the wall type of place. It doesn't look so clean inside but as long as there are no health violations I'm fine with it!"}
{"text":"Try the spicy beef pho. Absolutely delicious. If you like Pho or have never had it.  You will love it I swear"}
{"text":"It's their second day of being open and my second time here.  Very good Pho!  The shrimp and Chicken was delicious!  Also the Spring Rolls are amazing!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken pho as well as some pork spring rolls and it was delicious! The lady who served me was very attentive and welcoming. They accept cash and debit. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Terrible soon as I walked in the door! Should of just left. Went in no one greated me waited and looked at menu, another customer walked in. Owner peeked around the corner, came out with big smile for him, saw me and no smile and turned up nose! \"What you want?\" Asked for Banh Mi sandwich. \"How many?\" Asked how much. 6 dollar! Just want one. \"Ok you wait\". The other customer ordered full meal to go. During my 10min wait, family of 4 come in again no greeting, I give them the menus from my table. Owner comes out with big smile gives second customer full meal and he pays. I receive my order give her ca d to pay , \"sign here\" and she walked off before I finished signing! Sandwich on stale bread, piles of carrots one limp cucumber slice, 3 tiny slices of I guess pork, no pate, no cilantro! Definitely a no go! Stay away! Unbelievable BAD food and owners that just don't care!
As I left the family of 4 still had no employee go to their table."}
{"text":"This place is nothing fancy but I definitely don't mind a casual atmosphere. The food was delicious! We had the beef pho Thai, the shrimp pho, and the pork spring rolls. The shrimp pho had added vegetables which was nice!"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken curry and very fresh spring rolls.  Vegetables in stir fry were perfectly cooked.  Will return again!"}
{"text":"Yesterday my husband and I visited PHO LEE. We stood for several minutes in the empty restaurant before anyone acknowledged us. Our hostess/ slash waitress begrudging told us to sit anywhere even after that we had to get menus for ourselves. Even though we were the only ones in the restaurant the waitress took her sweet time coming to take our order. My husband ordered a Banh Mi sandwich. I ordered a chicken cabbage salad. At the same time we ordered BoBa drinks. Again there was another interminable wait for the food. When it came we asked why our drinks haven't come it. The waitress said they would come shortly. So we started on our entrees. The food itself was delicious. The portions were on the skimpy side and overpriced. We completed our entrees but still no drinks. We got up to leave and informed what appeared to be the manager  that they took too long with the drinks and we no longer wanted them. He seemed very perturbed . Then the waitress came out with the drinks. Once she learned we no longer wanted them she put them in a refrigerator to possibly serve future customers. All in all though the food was really good the entire dining experience was awful."}
{"text":"The pho and noodle dishes are very good here, as are the spring rolls.  The restaurant is clean and typically the service is good although I had one bad experience where I got the wrong order and our check was messed up. Sometimes the dining area is uncomfortably warm."}
{"text":"Hmm I feel bad because there was a little cute older couple running this restaurant but I came here with my sis in law. It was kind of a warm afternoon so I knew I did NOT want to get any soup of any kind!!!! Coming inside it was kind of warm. I ordered a sprite and it came in a room temperature/warm can. One thing about me is I do NOT like to pour my non alcoholic beverages over ice because it waters it down for me and I just hate it. Also, if I order a sprite I don't want to drink a warm sprite, who does? So I was kinda like grrr after that but still kept an open mind. She took our order, my sis in law went first and then I proceeded to order steak cubes with rice. She then mumbled that I should try this other thing. I couldn't quite understand her but it was my dumb self that I felt a little guilty inside and her cute little ole self that I just went with it. She was like yeah that's good, you will like it. I'm like, ummm okay..so we are waiting for my food and didn't even think about it but my sister in law laughed and said, what did you order? I told her, I have NO clue, because I didn't!!!!! I said, it better not be soup!!!!!! Then she proceeds to walk toward me with a huge bowl of what???....SOUP!!!!!!! Grrrrr. I'm mainly mad at myself because that's the ONE thing I did NOT want! I ordered steak and rice and she recommended me something WAAAAY different than what I wanted! Who does that? I then proceeded to eat it because I felt like I was at my gmas house and I would get a guilt trip. There was minimal noodles in it and it had a meat that god knows what it was. Minimal meat that was fatty meat mind you. It wasn't good at all. Also, they disappeared for a while and my poor sis in law never got the water that she ordered."}
{"text":"First time here since my go to pho place-viet kitchen- was closed. Reviews were good so we tried it. A few bites in, I found two gnats in my soup. Will not be returning"}
{"text":"First time at Pho Lee. Very good experience. Was planning on a sandwich but ended up with shrimp and pork spring rolls and a specialty dish. 

Conversation went something like this....do you like Pho? Response was yes. Do you like bbq pork and grilled shrimp. Response was yes. I was served a delightful dish that had multiple textures and serving temperatures, including rice noodles, bbq pork, grilled shrimp with small egg rolls and a cabbage salad served  in a bowl. No broth as it was actually a tasty noodle bowl. 

They were very accomodating. You could smell and hear the food being prepared. Prices and quality were very good. Will be back to try the Pho and sandwich. You can make a meal of just the spring rolls."}
{"text":"Great Pho, friendly people.  Service is great, take out orders always ready on time upon arrival in about 10-15 minutes.  This is the only Pho in the area.  I like the Special Pho a lot, comes with a little bit of each meat.  Broth very flavorful.

5 stars."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open up since it is close to our house. We eat Vietnamese about once a week, got the taste for it after working in Saigon about 10 years ago.   The place is quite small, fairly clean.  The Pho is more expensive than I would expect compared to other Viet restaurants we frequent, perhaps 10% higher.   the taste was average, I don't think the time was spent on the broth that is typical.  Also, and this was the biggest letdown,  the menu specified 3 springs rolls and showed what is a typical size based on our experience. We were served only 2 and they were perhaps 1/3 shorter than comparable restaurants. The server was unable to provide an explanation as to why the serving did not match the menu in number or size.   Oh, if you want a refill on your tea, expect to get it yourself Servers had not figured out that's how they earn part of their tip.  All in all, a letdown, I had high hopes, being so close to our house.    We will just keep going to the one on Cave Creek Rd."}
{"text":"Pho lee has been a nice addition to the neighborhood.  Nothing special to eat in,  but take home is great! I call ahead and they give you all you need to put together a great bowl of Pho! The taro boba is delicious. My only complaint is they need a menu online. I get the Special pho which has all the meats in the bowl. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is sooooo good and service was great. Will surely come again!! Love the Thai tea!!!"}
{"text":"I got take out - Chicken Pho. I have eaten this same meal at lots of places, and this was one of the best! The man who helped me (may be the owner) was very sweet. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not worth the money. I love Pho soup and go to various places searching for \"the spot\" for Pho soup and this place is definitely not worth the stop. They cheap out on a lot of things, for example we stayed to eat and they still served our drinks in styro-foam cups and to go plastic cups. The Tai tea is like kid size and they serve you more ice than tea. They don't even have real traditional Asian spoons just regular plastic disposable spoons. I paid extra for the X-Large Pho soup and I know I've gotten more noodles and soup condiments in other places paying for the regular size soup. And we got very little soup condiments to add. The soup did taste good but the experience was not worth it. To top all this off, they ONLY TAKE CASH. Their menu is super limited on all other items so unless you want basic Pho soup, I don't recommend you come here in search of various types of food. There is definitely tons of better Places that serve Pho soup and other Vietnamese dishes."}
