{"text":"My first zero star. But yelp doesn't allow zero.

This is absolutely the worst Italian restaurant I have ever gone to anywhere in the world.  

The antipasti were all burnt and taste like charcoal.  

65 minutes after waiting for the entrees, the waitress arrived and told us that one of our orders were nit available. 

It was a business lunch with a large group and the customer kept looking at his watch.  This will not end well. 

The food were terrible, which started arriving at around 75minutes were bland and tasteless. The shrimp in the linguini tasted like cardboard. The rare ny steak was over burnt and well dine.  Everyone on the table used lots of black pepper to mask the horrible food. In vain. 

I don't believe I will ever come back here."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times for winterlicious and summerlicious. Usually the food is alright, not good or great. The service was fine for sure and they are accommodating for sure. I recently found out that they are officially CLOSED!"}
{"text":"I read some reviews on redflagdeals before I went, and it is just like what people said, a hit or miss. 

The night that I went, they assigned our table at the dinning room near the front. It was a Thursday night and just the night before winterlicioius beings too, so the restaurant was actually fairly quiet (there were three other groups around us). Couple things I don't get, half of the restaurant was empty, but the hostess put us right next to the other customers. That's fine too, but their tables were placed too closed to each other, the chairs were back to back after a customer was seated.  When the main dinning room was dim and not busy, the hostess put us in the small, bright dinning room and is partly under renovation too (the booths are half removed) 

Food and price are reasonable.  I didn't try their steak, we got two pastas and a rack of bbq ribs. The two pastas are way better than the ribs. I can probably make better ribs at home....The pastas are around $13-$15 ...their winterlicious menu is even cheaper, $25 prix fix you get a three course meal and you can choose rack of lamb as main. Can someone tell me if that's good later?

Service was so so, the server we got was not the best but you can tell that's just her personality, she didn't really mean it type. She came over a two times before we actually finished our food. We were still picking on it and our forks and knife were put separately. And then 15 minutes later, one of my friends was on the phone and she thought we were done and she came over and took the plate when there was still more than half a plate of pasta. We didn't stop her, also because we were kind of full already. However, you just feel like she's rushing you to finish."}
{"text":"*WARNING* this restaurant is under new management and it's shot to hell!   The menu has changed, the quality of the food is below McDonalds standard, the wait time was atrocious. For your own sake, DON'T DO IT! My wife and I left extremely dissatisfied without paying. There was oil or soap residue in our drinks, the meal portion size was that of a happy meal. The food took forever to come to the table and there were foreign meats that were inside which weren't in the menu description. To top it off, the food didn't taste good. We took 2 bites before finally deciding to scram! The best thing on the menu was the diet coke...no joke!"}
{"text":"Where to begin.
Food: 
Appetizer calamari was okay but how do you go wrong with deep fried food 
Entree: 
margarita pizza looked nothing like there picture. It felt like I was eating a bruschetta pizza with tons of olive oil, crust was hard and no basil on pizza. Worst margarita I ever had.
Lamb with veggies and roast potato. Asked for medium rare and it came medium well server said he would take it back and bring us a new one. Second order was medium rare but the seasoning was gone they forgot to put on the seasoning. Kind of bland. Roast potato,s tasted like card board I guess they didn't remake potatoes just left the ones we got under the heat and left it there to dry up. 

Service: server was nice in the beginning but was never around the restaurant wasn't even busy maybe 4 tables at most. At the end when we got the bill we waited long for him to come back we had to ask another waiter to get him. Our waiter came back and apologized and said \" I am sorry I forgot about you guys\" WTH is that. I guess it's because he put gratuity on our bill that he thought he didn't have to give us good service at all.

At the end of the day I will never come back to eat there again"}
{"text":"I was there last week taking a co-op student of mine to a Lunch.  We got there around 12:15pm and made our orders at 12:16pm, but like many people said here, food never arrived until 1:15pm.  It was horrible, waiting all that time.  But, the food was fine.  Also the atmosphere was not so bad."}
{"text":"I've only been there once and will never go back again. A co-worker said the food was great, well, it wasn't. It took really long to get my order and even longer to get my glass of water refilled. I couldn't finish my food since it was so bland and decided to pack it up, fix it up myself for a quick meal the next day. Next day I've seasoned and reheated my food, and at my very last bite I saw that there was a dead fly in my chicken. I was completely horrified! Bad food AND dead bugs?! I do not recommend this place to even my worst enemies. Avoid!!! If I could give them no stars I would."}
{"text":"I went to Joe Maggiano's after having attended a funeral nearby. The 3 of us were starved and also wanted to have some wine to lighten our spirits. I had to drive so wine was not a big draw for me. 

The restaurant is currently undergoing renovation. The bathrooms were atrocious and we were seated at a booth that was dark... I looked up at the ceiling to see a hole where he light bulbs were to go and the wiring hanging out loosely for all to see. The restaurant was not very busy which was an early indication as to the quality of the food.

We ordered a bottle of white wine at $20, which was pretty decent. The mains we ordered were: lasagna, spicy chicken and seafood, and the fish and chips.

We got a basket of garlic bread to start. The bread was quietly oily on the outside but quite dry on the inside. The garlic flavor was a little bland. The bread itself wasn't really warm either.

I had the Spicy Chicken & Seafood - and it was spicy alright!  It was served with vegetables and rice.  The vegetables were very tender, and the rice mixed with the sauce was divine.  The chicken however was a bit dry, though the skin was nice and crisp.  The scallops were overdone, and dry (but I haven't gone to many a restaurant that ever cooks scallops right).  The shrimp were pretty juicy.

I had a taste of the lasagna, and the pasta was very soft, but I found the tomato sauce to be bland and boring.  I didn't taste the fish, but the fries were amazing.  Bursting of potato flavour, not too oily, and the outside was nice and crisp.

For dessert, we had the creme brulee, the chocolate truffle cake, and the strawberry cheesecake.  The cheesecake was bland, not sweet enough, but not too heavy.  The chocolate truffle cake had a really dry sponge base, topped with mousse.  I basically ate the mousse portion because the sponge cake base was so dry and unappetizing.  The creme brulee (what was my friend thinking?! Ordering creme brulee from an Italian eatery?  You wouldn't go to Russia for Chinese food would you?!) - it was watery and runny... I didn't taste even a hint of vanilla.  It was a bru-tal brulee.  

The service was good.  Our server had a great sense of humour, and she was always quick to refill our glasses of water. 

Overall, the experience was average.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come back again, but if I was in the neighbourhood, I might swing by again."}
{"text":"The place has changed a lot. I think it is the ownership. Great food and great wait staff. What a turn around. I am amazed. This is now a great friendly place."}
