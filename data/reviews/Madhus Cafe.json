{"text":"this place is great! has great food and coffee, super nice staff, and is cozy. this place makes Kingston road a little less lame! and definitely deserves a higher yelp rating!!"}
{"text":"Dig this space for coffee and vibe. Compared to the 'bucks down the street this is an oasis of calm. Coffee is from Pilot, and homemade food is yum (cookies and cinnamon rolls). Looks like they're adding more lunch choices which should help them build more traffic (will be 5 stars once they get this up and running).   My new \"go to\" place in the 'hood"}
{"text":"Hours are off a lot of times. What they have posted today: Monday CLOSED Tuesday-Sat 9-6 Sunday 930-500  Honestly I like place and it seems to have love put into it... BUT this is the third time I've come and they've changed the hours. (If you need to meet someone for a coffee find another place; if you're solo and don't mind freestyle hours this is your place.)  Coffee is okay (first couple of times was great, hit and miss after that). Food okay as well.   Music is great."}
{"text":"Cool decor, super friendly staff, great atmosphere, amazing lattes and vegetarian wraps."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee. Super nice owners and staff.  The vinyl spinning on the turntable is a nice surprise. It's busy but worth the wait for delicious food and locally roasted coffee from Pilot."}
{"text":"Finally!  I decent cappuccino in the area. Pilot beans, delicious frothed milk the way it should be! Small cafe but a power taste. More people in the area need to find this gem."}
{"text":"They start with good beans (Pilot) and make decent drinks, but it's just not a welcoming place. It's clean and comfortable, but the staff make little effort to greet you and be sociable.   In addition, it boggles my mind that someone would spend hours in a coffee shop and make no effort to learn to pour latte art."}
{"text":"Interesting space as its more of an event area by the night and cafe by day from what I understood. I tried the the cappuccino here Here is the verdict.  Crema: Decent. They use Pilot espresso beans if that matters to you  Milk: Frothed average Latte Art: Meh The espresso shot was decent and saved this drink from being a 2 star. Serving is on the small size. The desserts look nice so try those out if you can Setup is quite nice, 2.5 stars for the drink. Half star added for the space. P.S. Their website is down so only a FB page is their web presence for now."}
{"text":"Read as a 2.5  The coffee is decent, but I'm very surprised it's not fair trade/organic.  This is a big mistake on their part, as there are other cafes that are similar but faster and this could help them differentiate themselves.  They also use individual serve Kraft honey, which I can't appreciate. Provide a bottle of some decent honey, please. The service is pretty good and everyone is kind enough, but it is excessively slow.  I've watched the owners sitting down while the staff is bombarded and not jumping in to assist. The fresh boxes are pretty good, but a bit pricey for what they are. I really want to continue to support them because they are an independent business and have so much potential, but I think they need to seriously reevaluate their approach and practices."}
{"text":"Madhüs is permanently closed, as of about 3 weeks ago. There is an eviction notice on the door, and another café is about to open in the same space. It's a huge loss for the neighbourhood.  Byram: I will miss your open mic jam sessions, beatnik salads, and listening to rough mixes of new tracks. Kendra: I will miss your cortados, culinary mastery, whiskey sours, and your unshakeable determination to make Madhüs something more than just a coffee shop. You both made neighbourhood a better, hipper, more alive place - thank you!"}
{"text":"This place has come on the Beaches coffee scene in a big way over the last number of months. It is unbeatable for space and atmosphere, with tables in the front, couches in the back, and tasteful decor. The Pilot coffee will be familiar to Te Aro customers, and, of course, is typically smooth and delicious. Free refills makes this place very attractive for coffee lovers! Baked good and food selection could be expanded to make this the place of choice on the increasingly gentrified Kingston Road strip. Great idea with the events on certain nights and weekends, and when there is live music, it's a draw. Still some kinks to be worked out though, and consistency of hours is one of them."}
{"text":"My favourite cafe in the neighborhood. Great cappuccinos and the baked goods are delicious. The savory pies are great too.  I wish they opened earlier in the day so I could have my morning coffee there."}
{"text":"Great vibe to this place.  Good place if you enjoy Pilot beans, which are roasted literally down the block. This place is completely unassuming and you would have no idea it's owned by a famous musician who has worked with Drake, amongst others."}
