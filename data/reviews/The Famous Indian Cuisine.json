{"text":"Great food, very quiet restaurant. When we went we were welcomed nicely and the waiter made sure to come back to check if we were doing okay and refilled our water. Will come back again. We were the only customers in the restaurant at the time and there was no music playing so it was a bit awkward."}
{"text":"I went to this place after reading reviews on yelp, checked out their lunch buffet. Very mediocre at best. Naan was fresh an that was good, but the rest of the food was bland. The lamb/goat was very tough. I was not impressed. The best south Asian in the gerrard area is still Lahore Tikkah house iMHO ."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in into The Famous Indian we felt like we came into someone's home. We were greeted by the owner who was very sweet and friendly. He sat us down and told us about the specials on their buffet. Everything looked fresh and clean.  The vibe of the place is a little grungy, but then again you are in Little India, so it's kind of expected.  The food was very homy and good. There were some vegetarian options for me so I was happy.  Okay, to be honest I would normally leave 3 stars to this kind of place, so why am I leaving 4 stars? Because the owner made us feel so welcome and went above and beyond to make sure we are happy with everything.   If you are in the area and are feeling Indian then definitely check this place out:)"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for the dinner buffet (I think it was only around $12). Great value for your money.  Pretty good variety of buffet foods. The butter chicken was excellent and all of the other meat dishes were pretty good! The freshly made naan bread that came with the buffet was the best I've had.   My only complaint is that the server wasn't very helpful in explaining the dishes to me - I'm not an Indian food expert and was asking what the foods were and he very quickly just called out the names of everything in a thick Indian accent, so I have no idea what 50% of the food was that I ate."}
{"text":"Delicious! Quaint little restaurant, no frills, but great service and tasty food. Fresh naan was brought to our table and we jumped right into our meal. The dishes aren't labeled, but it's pretty easy to figure out what the food is. Ice cream seemed a little old but it's an unexpected plus anyways. All four of us left in good spirits...perhaps a little too full."}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian I've had in Toronto. Perfectly balanced flavours, nice fresh naan. Friendly service, and good price."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  I went for the lunch buffet with my boss yesterday at \"The Famous\" (that's how they answer the phone!), hoping that they would live up to their name and not be deserving of a 2 letter prefix (i.e In-).  The gentleman was very friendly on the phone and indeed when we arrived he shook our hands!  He offered us complimentary pop to boot.  After we ate the chef came out and asked us how we liked everything, I thought I was a VIP until I remembered I was at an Indian lunch buffet on Gerrard!   The buffet was as fresh as any that I have had, the tandoori chicken was without doubt the best I have had at a buffet, piping hot, very moist and tender with just the right amount of charredness to add flavour.  Good selection of main dishes too, with butter chicken, lamb curry, chicken curry, saag paneer, eggplant dish, chick pea masala, this list is not exhaustive!  Also the pakoras and naan bread were served fresh and crispy, I cannot fault the food.  There was dessert if desired but as I usually have 3 plates of food I almost never indulge.  If you are going here for lunch call ahead as I think they made a special effort once I said we were coming for the first time to try the buffet.  And the whole thing is going for the low low price of $9.99!!!  I felt like I was stealing from them.....  Half a point off for decor and it was a little cold in there, although it was the coldest day of the year outside so I'm sure it's not normally like that.  CHECK IT YOS!"}
{"text":"New location but same great food. We had the veggie pakora appetizer which was good and a bit much for the two of us. Maybe a half order next time? The chicken tikka and lamb do piazza we're very tasty. We'll be back."}
{"text":"i really had high hopes for this place because of the reviews, but it really felt short. I'm not very picky with indian food but this was very mediocre..  Butter chicken was sweet, not very sweet, but noticeably sweet. Chicken was plentiful though!  Tandoori chicken was good, dry though  Fish curry was good  Chickpeas tasted stale.  dessert and salad selection was very small. Salads included cucumber salad and lettuce. Desserts were just ice cream and the sweet balls.   OVERALL, food was warm, food was not spicy and not flavoured and service was whatever."}
{"text":"My go to place for years. Went in years ago for the buffet. It was great. Hot, fresh, lots to choose. Owner/Chef was so nice. Over the years I've always used them for Take Out and have made friends Famous Fans. It's their go to place too now. Always order Vegetable,Pakoras, Naan, Chicken Tikka, Butter Chicken, Saag Lamb, Aloo Gobi, Channa Masala, Pulao. Can't say enough good things about this place. I've never been disappointed ever. Hits my taste buds in the right place every time."}
{"text":"This is my favourite indian place. Sometimes they have fish and this is different from other indian places in the area. Their butter chicken and chicken korma are excellent. I like their nan and dessert, too. They have good ice creams, too. They have a small space. Sometimes they are over crowded and I cannot have my seat when someone has a seat behind. The service is good and the waiter is always friendly. I love Famous!!!"}
{"text":"I was craving indian buffet and the yelp reviews brought me here.    The food was pretty good.  Naan'swere fresh and plentiful and the selection Of dishes was decent.  Butter chicken was not the best I've had by any means, too sweet and no heat.  But overall the other dishes were great.  The tandoori chicken was excellent.    The staff was very welcoming and friendly.   It was a little cold inside but the staff made me feel we could have stayed all night and have been welcome - they made up for it.    I was highly impressed by the pricing and bang for your buck.  I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Famous is a great spot in Little India for a buffet style all you can eat meal.  We were here for my father's birthday and my family really enjoyed the food.     Famous features great dishes with a lot of flavour and does not taste like a typical Indian buffet. They make fresh naan and bring it to you table.  Pricing is affordable and comparable to other buffet places in the area.  I will definitely be back for future meals!  Check Famous out if you are in the Little India neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to good, cheap and delicious buffet in Little India. The mango lassis are delicious. We go there so often that the owner knows us now and will stop and have a conversation with us. Very friendly! The restaurant moved to a larger space across the road, which is larger than the old place, but still lacks when it comes to decor. I don't go here for the atmosphere, though, and the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Agree with the other reviewers about this buffet place, as it really hit the spot! Half of the curry dishes were veg and the other half meat based and the tandoori chicken was splendid. Upon entering we were heartily greeted with smiles and a handshake by an enthusiastic and friendly proprietor. The small room didn't have anything going for it, but they said they are moving into their own space soon nearby in Little Pakistan which will help their curb appeal. Food was great here! You need to ask for naan and they make it fresh so it was warm, steamy and delicious! The price for lunch buffet is $9.95 and dinner is $11.95 and they only tacked on a dollar for a pop. Make sure you overtip so they can keep going!!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout for pickup the other day. Wish they delivered though. With that being said the food was surprisingly good. Tasty, not greasy. Will get extra spicy next time. Price was awesome for the amount of food. Would definitely order again. The guy on the phone was friendly and accommodated both my husbands and my wishes. Can't wait to try the buffet!!! Will be visiting soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after reading reviews on Yelp. They had a buffet set up which had everything that we liked except nothing spicy to my high heat and spice tolerance. The owner and chef said no problem and made me 2 dishes off the charts in flavor and heat. Great hospitality and great food stop in you'll like it too!!"}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  This place is a steal. I went for dinner here on a weeknight and it was an all you can eat buffet for $11.99. There are a decent amount of options for the price. I had a craving for butter chicken, so I mostly stuck to this, but there were a number of different curries to choose from. There was only one rice option (plain rice), but I was fine with this. They also had a number of vegetarian options too - chenna (chickpea) masala, a variety of salads and something else that I can't remember (maybe saag paneer?).   The gluten-free options were: salads, rice, butter chicken, chenna masala, chicken curry, tandoori chicken, probably the other curries too, and ice cream (not the ones with cookies in them, obviously). They also have sweet and mango lassi (yum!). I didn't ask the owner specifically to point out the gluten-free items though since I'm familiar with Indian dishes and knew what shouldn't have gluten. Everything I ate was delicious and I didn't have any reactions.    The only downside to this place is that the food items are not labelled. I could tell what most of the items were by looking at them, but this should be a mandatory thing.   TL;DR - lots of gluten-free options but items are not labelled"}
{"text":"This is the BEST Indian buffet in the area.  I've never had their A La Carte before but by the taste of their buffet, I'm sure it's equally good.  I've gone to this restaurant about 50 times in my life and has gained about 15 pounds in 6 months going to this place.  You just can't stop eating when you go there because the food is sooo good.  The chickpeas are my favourite, the tandoori is excellent as you can taste the charcoal taste yet it's very moist and not dry, the naan is made perfectly every single time and arrives promptly before even you are done getting your first plate!!  The service here is good and hands down to the gentleman who has been our server for the past few years, it's ashame I never got his name and thanked him before he got ill and stopped working there for awhile =("}
{"text":"Came here on my lunch break, checked yelp to see what was in the area that was recommended, wouldn't have found this place otherwise. Happy I did so. Ordered 3 chicken briyanni and dal makhani. Usually when you order chicken briyanni from an Indian restaurant, they use the cheapest cuts of meat and the chicken doesn't always taste the freshest; luckily at this spot they are the only place that I have ever been to that uses chicken breast. The quality of the food was spectacular. My father who was also joining me for lunch, has spent 6 years of his life living in India, he swears this was one of the best briyannis he's tried. Was perfectly spiced, not too overbearing like I've been familiar with. The dal makhani was also really high quality. Over all I definitely recommend this restaurant. They also have a lunch buffet that looked really good, priced moderately, bookmarked definitely going to come back and give it a try."}
{"text":"I love this Indian buffet! It's cheap, quick, and delicious. Whenever my friends crave Indian food, I take them here. Everything I've tried is good. They have something for everyone, from butter chicken, to pakora, to tandoori, to salads, to ice cream for dessert. They are constantly replenishing the buffet, so they never run out of anything. The naan is made fresh when you sit down and goes great with all the saucy foods. The server we usually get is friendly and efficient and happy to chat with us when it's not busy. He also tells us what something is when we aren't sure and reassures us that it's tasty and it usually is. It's something like $11 I $12 for dinner, which is pretty darn good considering how full you leave the restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food - both in selection and quality. Every dish in the buffet (my favourite way to have Indian) was flavorful, hot or cold as appropriate, regularly replenished, and very tasty. With so many options in this section of town, I'm very glad we chose this one. And the price is so reasonable!  Not sure where the negative reviews & ratings came from because this place is as good or better than any other option in Toronto.  We'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I was there last Sunday for lunch.  I have not been here for 3 years because I moved out of the area.  I had a huge craving for Indian food and the first place I thought of is \"The Famous Indian Cuisine\".  I can't believe it, same price as 3 years ago.  This is unheard of in today's market.  ($9.95 for lunch and $11.95 for dinner).  The food is excellent and server is very friendly.  Naan bread was freshly made, the buffet was fully stocked.  I ate so much that I could not eat dinner.  Lol.  I love teh Butter chicken, Tandoori Chicken, creamy Spinach, Tofu, Lamb, peas, etc.  All I can say, I love this place.  Great place and great prices."}
{"text":"Would have given more stars but the food has almost no spiciness. Flavours are ok, If you don't like any heat at all, this place is for you."}
{"text":"I would have literally given negative stars if there was an option, the worst Indian restaurant buffet we have ever had in our life. The lady serving naan was so impolite. The owner served naan when we just sat on our table and was ready for appetiser, and after that they don't even asked again if we require more naan bread. The taste of all curries was so bland and tasteless that we could hardly finish our food. The Gilab jamun in desert was hard as like rock and cold as ice. Worst lunch we had in Toronto so far."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food here, I mean like really yummy and super cheap. Great spot, you can get takeout from the buffet too which is major bonus. Also, wine is crazy cheap (like $3.50 a glass! What??)"}
{"text":"Terrible. Worst Indian buffet that I've ever been to (and I've been to lots). Oh fellow Yelpers, how you let me down this time!! I've yet to eat in an Indian restaurant that I didn't like. Until today.  My husband and I have had the buffet in many of the restaurants in Little India and they've all been delicious and a great experience. But silly me, I decided to try somewhere new so went on Yelp and picked this place based on the high ratings.  We arrived at 12:30 absolutely famished and ready to dig in to some yummy Indian goodness. The place was small, dark and unassuming. We could see that there was very little at the buffet table so we thought that we were early. We double checked and confirmed that lunch had started an hour ago at 11:30. Our server (owner?) told us that we could get started so we headed to the buffet table where we were disappointed to see that there was only steamed rice and a measly 5 dishes - channa masala, very watery dhal (with no bowls to put it in), saag \"paneer\" (with NO PANEER!!), butter chicken and a beef curry. After about 20 minutes, they added a matar paneer dish. Their \"salad\" section was literally a bowl of iceberg lettuce, a bowl of cucumber slices and small bowl of pickled veggies plus some sauces. I should have trusted my instinct and left when we saw the poor selection. Most of the food was ok but nothing special.  The saag paneer though had no paneer, just greasy spinach and the dhal was much too salty and watery. The channa and the meat dishes (according to my husband) were good.  This was by far the measliest Indian buffet that we've ever been to. It was obvious that we were the first ones there so it's not as if they had run out of food. There was none of the dishes that you would typically expect at an Indian buffet -- no samosas, no bhajji, no pakoras, no biryani, no tandoori chicken, no kebabs, no vegetable dishes, no salads (though as we were leaving 45 minutes later we saw that they had added tandoori chicken and a potato dish). Worst of all there was NO NAAN (??!!) Who has an Indian buffet with no naan?? After 15 minutes, we asked if there was naan and were told \"it's coming\". It finally arrived after 30 minutes when we'd already eaten 2 plates of food and were  almost full. No apology for the wait. Although the naan was actually delicious no one wants to eat it on its own -- the whole point is to eat it with your food and soak up the sauces!  The service was also terrible. Although our waiter was warm and welcoming when we first came in, he virtually ignored us for most of the meal. You'd think that since we were the only customers for almost the entire meal, we'd have his full attention. (The fact that it was completely empty at 12:30 on a Saturday should have been a big clue to us right there). We were never offered anything to drink. I would have loved some tea, especially because it was freezing in the restaurant. Our dirty plates sat on the table for most of our meal and our water glasses refilled once. The waiter stood by silently while I looked around for a bowl to put the dhal in, never offering any assistance. I ended up putting it in a teeny tiny ice cream bowl that held about 2 spoonfuls. There was no apology for the limited food selection or for the long delay before getting naan at the end of our meal. Seeing as 2 dishes were added as we were leaving (perhaps more afterwards), they should have told us that not all the food was ready yet and told us to wait before starting (we would have been happy to wait) OR they could have apologized (imagine that!) OR offered us $$ off of the bill. We're pretty understanding and would have been ok with any of these options but Instead they just ignored the issues and ended up with 2 unhappy customers and no tip. Sorry but if you're going to be charging customers full price for your buffet, you ought to have a full buffet ready to offer. It's really sad that some restaurants are so clueless about customer service.   Needless to say, we definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been to lots of indian buffets, I can say with confidence that this could be one of the best in Toronto.  The food is fresh and the staff is very nice.   I am mostly impressed that the butter chicken on the buffet is all chicken breast.    You don't find that any where for $9.99  I will be sure to return."}
{"text":"Went last night for the $10.99 dinner buffet, and they had THE BEST CHICKEN TANDOORI that I think I've ever had!   The tandoori had twice the flavor and moisture of run-of-the-mill tandoori, leaving quite an impression. Everything else on the buffet was also above-average, and the naan was so light it almost melts in your mouth, so I don't hesitate to recommend The Famous."}
{"text":"went again.  This time, no crowd, as it was 5pm and they had just opened for dinner.  The service was good, the butter chicken is still one of the best dishes on the strip, but much of this food - certainly the tandoori chicken and the pakoras - tasted like warmed over lunch.  which it was.  fresh food please!"}
{"text":"Great little buffet joint in the heart of Little India.  Quiet, small restaurant which is family run.   Food here is authentic and delicious. A good variety of different fares in buffet style. The owner of the shop brings fresh naan which is served hot and fresh.   He also came around with some fresh Tandoori chicken right of the over.   The cost, at $11 and change including tax is a bargain.   Friendly and courteous staff who make this place great.   My only bone to pick is that the serving table in a little challenging to navigate. The dishes are not labelled and a little hard to reach but the taste and quality make up for that minor complaint I have.   All in all a great experience!"}
{"text":"I never was here before the reno, however have been here 3 times in the last month and have loved it each time. Fairly priced, always fresh and most important of all, friendly and courteous service. Skylark down the street is cheaper and more selection, but the quality is always hit or miss. Willing to pay a bit more for what The Famous has to offer."}
{"text":"New update: I have been there many times since my review below. And it seems like they are getting their act together. The food is consistently good and price is just perfect. If you go on Friday evening they have Seek Kabab on the buffet table. original review: We usually go to Siddhartha, but decided to check this place out. I was surprised by the good quality of food. The naan were soft and fresh (unlike siddhartha). The eggplant dish was fabulous; palak paneer was good and also the chick peas. The butter chicken is good, better than any I have had in Toronto, for the best butter chicken you will have to go Bombay. Overall very good experience at $12 for dinner buffet. Bye to Siddharta for a while."}
{"text":"It's now known as \"The New Famous Indian Cuisine\" since they moved down the street from their previous location as \"The Famous Indian Cuisine\". It's become one of our favourites for cheap Indian AYCE buffet, making the trek out of the downtown core worth it for us.  The food here is good, it gets replaced every so often by the kitchen even during less busy hours. The na'an is great and comes fresh to the table. Unfortunately, the buffet is not labeled. Table service was alright, we managed to have our waters refilled occasionally and our dirty plates were removed when we left them in a stack at the end of the table. Otherwise, the one waitress was sitting at the front on her phone during the off hours.  I thought it was strange that you only get 1 scoop of ice cream - any more it's extra."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet with my boyfriend today. We tried pretty much every dish (including the salads and rice pudding).   The pros: decent selection, excellent service, hot naan bread served at your table, tasty mater paneer.  The cons: food was *very* sweet (especially the butter chicken - this was inedible), the lamb dish was dry and undercooked lamb, the sag paneer didn't have ANY paneer in it, and the curries were generally mostly sauce with little meat or veg.  Would we return? No."}
{"text":"\"The Famous\" could make the Gerrard India Bazaar famous all on its own.  They have great food, with variety of spices and tastes, that certainly does NOT fall onto that common trap of everything tasting the same. The salads are crunchy and fresh, and the Naan is always fresh and hot. My only complaint is I wish they would bring it a little sooner as we love the food and we love to eat it with bread. Being a buffet it is a fantastic value. We discovered this gem when coming to TO, apartment hunting, We moved into the neighbourhood and have become regulars. Chef is very friendly and often comes out from the back to check on the customers."}
{"text":"11.99 dinner buffet and it's good! That's pretty much all I need to say but I'll keep going. The selection isn't too big but I don't know what you would expect for $11.99 dinner buffet. He butter chicken was good with creaminess and good flavour but not as rich as other places. The tandoori chicken was alright, a bit dry, but again, what do you expect for 11.99? My favourite was the spinach. Forget what it is called but very soft, seasoned well and creamy. Plus the host brought fresh made Naan to our table. Only one server but makes sense since it's a small restaurant and only one other couple. There is ice cream but the sign says 1 scoop each and $1 for each extra scoop which I've never seen but we were stuffed so didn't need more.  Overall a good restaurant, VERY reasonable price for tasty Indian dinner buffet. Plus the host/owner is nice."}
{"text":"Great service. Tasty food. Cons: dim lighting, hard to see what You r actually digging in. lack variety when it comes to desserts. Overall, good food at a very cheap price. Outstanding service."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best Indian buffet I've had. The place is small and unassuming ..but, man, everything was delicious. The quality of the meats especially the goat was out of this world...sauces awsome ...and oooooh the drumsticks (vegetable) were so good."}
{"text":"The Famous is my absolute favourite Indian buffet by any means in the city. It's a totally non-descript small little venue, completely basic on the interior, yet boasts fabulous food and service. The food is always fresh, and usually there is only one server on staff, but he is always amazingly on the ball, attentive, and in good spirits.  This place drew me away from Siddharta which used to be our neighbourhood favourite for many years. The reason for the switch is hearing through word of mouth that they serve kebab at the buffet, this being one of my absolute favourite dishes. The kebab (lamb) is delicious, as is the naan, which is super fresh and brought to your table for you. I love this touch, as it tastes so much better than naan that has been sitting out at a buffet, getting hard and dry from being made well in advance to serve the buffet crowds.  Everyday they rotate a buffet \"special\", but always have their staple dishes (spinach/saag, butter chicken, channa...). They are so geared towards keeping their customers happy and coming back for repeat visits, that if your daily special item is not on the menu, you can call ahead and they will make sure to make the dish for you, and include it in the buffet. To the person that remarked about not having eggplant on the menu on several occasions: the eggplant is a Sunday buffet special, but as mentioned, you can call ahead and make sure that it is prepped for you the day that you are coming in. They have told us to call 20 mins or so in advance.   The food is super fresh and this place is always jam-packed at suppertime. It's amazing how busy this place gets, considering there are other restaurants just up the block that are much nicer and more spacious on the inside, yet they do not draw the crowd the way The Famous does. The food, by far, is the best out of any buffet in the area, which keeps us always coming back for our favourite comfort dishes.   Peak times are usually around 6pm, but it quiets down around 7:30-8, so you should be able to get a table at this time without having to wait. The butter chicken is amazing, as is the daal, naan, channa, saag, aloo gobi, kebabs and everything else. Great for satiating that indian food craving and for good, soulful comfort food."}
{"text":"Called to order pick up at 6:15. 45 min waiting time for pick up? You have got to be kidding me. No reason why pick up should take this long. Its not even that busy. I can cook the food faster myself. Terrible."}
{"text":"4.5/5 to be exact.   If you want good Indian food go to little India (yes Toronto has such a thing, embedded in the gentrifying Leslieville).  If you want great Indian, go to Famous's buffet.   Forget Siddharta's or any other uppity restaurant on the block. Famous has an unassuming dining space but you always walk in to a friendly reception and walk out wishing you'd put your spoon down a plate earlier than you did.   Don't take my word for it. I surveyed the Indians in the area (yes- that's right- why not go to an authority on a subject) and most agree this hideaway has the best buffet on Gerrard street east. Furthermore it's available, lunch & dinner, at an AMAZING value (leave the plastic at home people, the loose change in the couch and car should cut it).  I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way for this buffet... I've had better Indian in DC, NYC, heck in Ottawa even... BUT if you're craving tandoori chicken on a whim, the 504 streetcar to Famous might be your best bet. And the kitchen guys are great. I've asked for a dish that's not on the daily special and been accommodated within buffet price tag!!!  I RECOMMEND: the naan. It's free with your buffet but comes straight and fresh to your table. Pff, who needs rice!   EXTRA TIP: don't let the waiters get carried away refilling your water glass. They are relentless! Oldest trick in the book, filling you up with liquids at an all-you-can-eat. SMH"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!!!  The chef is the owner! His food is so tasty! Unlike other Indian restaurants, he looks with minimal oil & it isn't super spicy!  The food is fresh and comes out hot!  The naan is great!  The mango lassi is amazing!   EAT HERE!!!!  You will LOVE it!!!!!"}
