{"text":"The restaurant looks dated. The walls seem cluttered and the furniture and utensils/dishes are cheap and heavily used. But honestly, it is pretty clean and it has a lot of windows to look out of. I don't really care about a restaurant's appearance as long as it has good food. But the food was not really good, but it is cheap and plentiful. So if you just want a causal place to eat and fill up, not really focused on taste, this is your kind of place.   I ordered the french onion soup, the classic smoke meat sandwich with fries and slaw, and the chicken pita wrap. The french onion soup was less than OK. It was brought out in the heated crock. It had a thick layer of cheese with salty soup, little onions, and mushy bread cubes. My biggest problem was the cheese- It was unidentifiable, it had hardly any flavor, and it just kinda melded together but it did not melt- it looked like brains and broke into huge chunks. That's not natural cheese- it is just weird. I saw it on their other dishes too, like poutine and pizza, gross. The smoked meat sandwich was alright- it was my first time having a smoked meat sandwich, the meat tasted like corned beef. For me, the meat was too soft- I like something with a little more bite, and the bread was too soft- it kept splitting apart as bite into it. The mustard on the sandwich complimented it nicely. The fries were bland and served with gravy. The slaw was your typical briny cabbage. I didn't really like that, but there was tons of food. The chicken pita wrap had the ordinary set- up: pita, chicken, onion, tomato, lettuce, and white sauce. It didn't have flavor really.  If I was short on cash and I was really hungry, I would go to this place again. But don't expect anything too tasty, just only good enough to kinda finish.  Atmosphere: 3/5 cheap looking, not fancy, old-school, but most importantly pretty clean.  Service: 4/5 waitress was really nice, but began to neglect filling our water later on Food: 2/5 eatable, but I did not find it enjoyable- lots of food for cheap- fake cheese?"}
{"text":"Je lui donne 1 étoile car l'option 0 étoile n'est pas disponible.  Le pire déjeuner et service que j'ai eu de ma vie (sans exagéré).  Nourriture non cuit, pas fraîche et un service pourrie.  Marcher quelques pas de plus et vous êtes rendu à la Binerie qui est selon moi un des tops pour les déjeuners traditionnelles."}
{"text":"Non recommandé... Fish&chip pas cuit, frite trop cuite, service vraiment moyen. Malheureusement, mauvaise expérience. Je n'y retournerai probablement pas."}
{"text":"Did I order the wrong thing? I was looking forward to my 2am plate of poutine after my night out! I was devastated when my fries came out all soggy and cold. Granted, gravy would eventually make my fritas soggy eventually but still, the ones not even touching the sauce were limp. Place was packed with NYE after party goers, how could the fries be soggy?  The only reason it's not one star is because of the vintage feel of the diner and the crowd this place draws. Even though my fries weren't great, people watching was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Place à recommander pour les poutines. Le service est toujours aimable même en fin de shift."}
{"text":"Alright everyone ! Its Time for another one of my famous reviews. First and foremost let me say that the menu is out of this world !What kind of poutine do you want ? Poutine with bacon? How about a smoked meat poutine ? Hmmm but I really want the Italian!! Aaw forget about it ! I want them all !!! Cheers mates I love my fans!! Xox"}
{"text":"Bien satisfaite pour un petit déjeuner à 6$! La serveuse Johanne est super sympathique;)"}
{"text":"This place hasn't changed at all over the years.  Nonetheless, management has changed a while ago and so did their service. Got mixed feelings  for this restaurant as my friend burned himself with their onion soup. This happened because the waiter or the restaurant itself failed to notice the customer in any kind of ways that the side of the plate would be burning hot . Needless to say , this was a pretty serious mistake from the waiter . Neither him or the manager itself could apologize to my friend saying that was an accident and it wasn't their fault. Like I said things have changed in that restaurant..  Recently , I have given the opportunity to redeem itself from the previous occasion . This time it was not a flop , the waitress was very attentive to our needs . My buddy and I enjoyed our smoke meat poutine , although I found it a bit too salty ... It was still a very good meal and I could rate it 7.5/10  I have concluded that this restaurant is still an excellent choice for late night snacking if one is in the area. Note that they don't serve their 24hours breakfast between 2-5am ;)"}
{"text":"Ok, ok. It's not fancy, it doesn't have a million toppings, the servers aren't hip young people. But I'm telling you, in my opinion Fameux has the best poutine in the city. Thick, crispy fries (no slim greasy things that turn to mush!), squeaky cheese and yummy gravy. The TRUE classic. I'd pick this place over any of those overrated poutine joints any day of the week."}
{"text":"Cool retro/vintage spot on Mont-Royal. Went for breakfast on a Friday morning. Ordered scramble eggs with smoked meat. Food was okay. Waitress was nice. Love this kind of place. Really old school.   Somked meat in my plate was greasy and thick-cut style, which I am not a big fan of. I would come back here mostly for the vibe of the place more than for their food.  *Wifi wasn't working."}
{"text":"Pour apprécier le Fameux à sa juste valeur, il faut y aller après une soirée un peu arrosée pour une poutine. Pour les timides, la taille régulière vous suffira pile poil. Pour les gourmands, n'hésitez pas à y aller avec le grand format. Quant aux choix des poutines: la régulière, la bacon et la québecoise sont mes recommandations.  À savoir: ils livrent chez vous pour une commande de plus de 15$.  Astuce: si vous vous faites livrer une/plusieurs poutines, demandez à ce qu'ils vous mettent la sauce séparée des frites. Ainsi, une fois chez vous, vous pourrez profiter du croustillant des frites au lieu de frites moles qui auraient attendues trop longtemps dans la sauce le temps de la livraison..."}
{"text":"This was my first poutine experience! I was a little scared at first because it slightly resembled throw up haha but omg it was delicious!!! I even heated it up the next day and it was great!!!"}
{"text":"Nodal location that provides spectacular people-watching, with food I would pay to *not* have to eat again.  The fries alone were a gross insult to the club sandwich plate as a philosophical concept.  And the faint tang of dishwasing liquid in the lettuce lingers on my palate like a misused apostrophe in a New York Times op-ed piece.  And speaking of New York, the club sandwiches in my two favorite old school diners in that spendy city are two-thirds the price of Fameux's.  And they are world class.  Mentioning the overflowing tub of mayonnaise dripping over my fries, after I'd ordered it without, and the less than blood temperature of everything on my plate, seems a bit like nuking a dead horse.  The relatively clean, functioning restroom, and the fantastic parade of  bright-eyed, beautiful women in snow-spangled snorkel parkas hustling past the enormous windows facing Mont-Royal, are the only things keeping this review out of the 1-star dumpster. If I ever come back, it'll be with a camera.  I'll have had my lunch."}
{"text":"40 minutes wait for two sandwiches. The smoked meat sandwich is half broken and cannot be picked up at all. We paid $2 for extra \"Swiss cheese\", but we received a small slice of Kraft cheese from Subway.   You will lose so much money from eating here, because time is money."}
{"text":"I went there for breakfast, and the food was a mix of cold and reheated stuff. Prices are reasonable, but there's much better around. Their \"feves au lard\" were good, but in small portion. For anything other than a late night case of the munchies, I'd go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Decent poutine and hot dogs, lots of seating, non-existent service.  Those are my general thoughts on this place. It felt super chill and retro but it also felt really sketchy. Everyone there looked sad, workers and customers. It was comfortable to sit and eat but on a nice sunny day it gets super dark inside, too gloomy.  I understand the vibe this place is going for but other places do it and better.   The waitress took our order with a \"I don't care about anything\" attitude. She didn't offer us any drinks so I had to ask a second waitress for glasses of water.  Everything was served quickly but not in a good way, it was just tossed on our table and then the waitress would run somewhere else before we could ask for more water or napkins.   I'm not usually picky with service but at the least don't serve me like you can't wait for me to leave. I like to sit down and chat with whoever I'm with. Feeling rushed and unwanted is a big turn off.  At least the food was good. Probably good enough to come back."}
{"text":"~update review: visited three time lately, and service was very inconsistent - do expect slow service at times and multiple mistakes on your order. I took off two stars from the rating~ I don't think the food is brilliant gourmet, but you don't come here for that. If you like your comfort food cheap, fast, and in a prime location - this is where you want to go."}
{"text":"This place is a legend, the old guard, a little of the old fashioned. But the clientele has gotten younger and younger everytime I've gone in for a club sandwich, cheeseburger or pogo. Recently I was there Christmas Day, me and some friends found ourselves on our own for the night and wanted to get some grub. Nothing was open except....good old Le Fameux!! I had a version of a hot turkey sandwich with a scoop of mash and some veg. Goodtimes, always to be had at this friendly and rustic diner. Go with friends or go alone it won't dissappoint."}
{"text":"If you go here, expect the following  1- lateness in having your order served 2- long waiting time to receive your bill and/or to pay at the front 3- Arguments with the waitresses.  For them, the client is always wrong.  Why would they tell you a full menu or a breakfast menu does not exist if you can see it on the other table  On top of that, they don't mind talking loud behind your back as if they were in a completely different room.  Rudeness from waitresses that have been there for 20 plus years.  Fights and brawls during the nights that you see while passing by..  People in front of me were leaving just because they couldn't take their rudeness anymore.  Here is the menu in case they tell you it doesn't exist."}
{"text":"I never had a meal there any other time than for breakfast. I really enjoyed their selection and prices.  Don't expect anything fancy, just old fashioned meals with your average grandmother's living room.  Great price and good taste!  Blanche,  a waitress there, is very welcoming and makes you feel at ease in no time!"}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable breakfast, tried this place out this morning and will definitely be coming back. Seated instantly and food handed to me within 8 minutes of ordering. And the food was absolutely delicious. Coffee included."}
{"text":"They dropped in quality as of late. It's really too bad. The pizza was great. Now.... It's a crap shoot. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's awful. I'm upset. I hate inconsistency. They get 5* on inconsistency."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review from the perspective of a die-hard bruncher, though I am well aware that this place has a whole other life, a night life as a poutinery and smoked meat stop!  This place is exactly what you expect from a corner diner that's been around a few decades: Standard issue diner coffee, refilled periodically... a moderate plate of eggs, bacon and potatoes. Also, toast, but for some reason they call it rôties. Honestly, I just had regular ole grocery store loaf toast that came much later than the rest of my food, cut diagonally in half in triangles and *barely* toasted. Eggs were perfectly cooked. The homefries were surprisingly sparse, but that's OK with me because I never finish all the homefries on a brunch plate anyway! The staff were all pretty sweet, and most of them seemed that they'd been workin' the same shift since the 70s. We probably could have used a little more attention that we received, but the kind personalities smoothed that out.   If you aren't too picky about brunch fixins, and can swallow down eggs and bacon trucker-style and just get on with your day, then this is a good pit stop for you. It's got a bit of retro charm, as well. The mood is casual, and there aren't too many people with kids cramming themselves into the booths around you, so you can drift away into your plate, your quiet conversation and the lull of the sunshine coming in all those street-view windows.   Worth one visit just to say you did! Maybe two."}
{"text":"Okay poutine. My mom had a middle-eastern something that I forgot. Both of us enjoyed the meal, and the serving size was huge. Still, we couldn't get over the diner-atmosphere of the restaurant. I guess it'd be a better feeling when it's cold and dark.   Service could be improved."}
{"text":"I love this place to death. Got beer and a giant breakfast here with my boss and a co-worker our last day on my summer job. Delicious food and the waitress was 100% on-the-ball and hilarious to boot. Got us in and out within barely half an hour, and our orders were not exactly small."}
{"text":"Ah Fameux. So reliable for the late night poutine, especially gratiné style where they take your poutine and put it in the oven and make the cheese all crispy and gooey and magique. This place has been in the same Greek family for 3+ generations, and they serve up a big menu of Quebecois fast food diner eats with speed and a sense of humour. Brown wooden booths, windows on Mount Royal and St Denis, a limited bar with just enough options to do you damage. The Star Burger comes with an onion ring and curd cheese and might give you a heart attack, but at least you'll die happy."}
{"text":"Had to find a place to get my friends from the west coast to try some poutine and smoked meat before heading to Tam Tams. This was the perfect spot. Honestly although the fries were very ordinary compared to other places, once the gravy and cheese curds came into the picture it balanced the taste nicely. Smoked meat was fresh and juicy, though the bread kept breaking. All in all a solid spot for late afternoon/night munchies"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm partial to this place because it's my local 'comfort zone' but it is actually really good! Always room, with it's big booths. Perfect hot spot for 'post' clubbing when your starving! ;) great club sandwiches with delicious fries!"}
{"text":"Came here last night to try some poutine with a good friend. Though I'm not a fan of poutine, the dish that we shared together just melted in my mouth. A pretty good way of making up for my general dislike for this piece of Canadian cuisine. The diner ambiance and being able to sit there for as long as you like without any hassle from staff is just awesome. Also, watching the attractive people walking by the big windows is a sure plus :)"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. It's not the first time I order from here but it will be the last. I don't know if they changed the owner or chef but the pizza was such a let down. The first time I tried their pizza, their tomato was amazing. There was a certain spice that they used that left you craving another piece. This time was completely different. There was barely any sauce on the pizza and the dough seemed to have been raw. It was chewy and sat on your stomach. It's a huge disappointment especially when you were craving their pizza and finally cave and have one bite and throw it away. A waste of calories."}
{"text":"I've been going to Fameux for well over a decade and until recently had only indulged in their \"gros poutine pour partager\" avec un coke and normally only after 2:00am. This 24-hour classic \"booths and old school waitresses\" diner is one of those authentic Montreal haunts where Franco Anglo young old hipster blue collar academic congregate under one roof to hunker down with some hearty eats. Their menu is fairly comprehensive but focuses on pizza, poutine, clubs, platters, and smoked meat. They also do a decent breakfast.  A friend, whilst pregnant, started craving their \"Star Burger Supreme\" and when I asked her partner what was in it they promptly whisked me away to sample it. We each ordered \"the\" burger, cherry coke and broiled poutine to share (which initially I thought sounded like sacrilege but turned out to be extremely satisfying eliminating the soggy fry factor). The star burger was INTENSE - consisting of a classic patty with bacon, cheese curds, onion rings AND a slice of cheese on a bun. It was impressive but overall I found it fairly bland (perhaps a little more  mustard would have helped?) and due to extreme grease-factor the bun got soggy before I could finish it. The cherry coke was a perfect, ultra sweet, way to cut through the grease though!  I'll continue frequenting this spot as I'm definitely a fan of their classic and broiled poutine, the mushroom pizza and the atmosphere in general. And really, who can resist a place with booths? I can't!"}
{"text":"I used to be in the Plateau area quite often but it took me a long time to finally try this restaurant.  It has a really nice \"diner\" feel to it and the staff members who served us was very polite.  However, she had walked off once her shift was over and someone else finished for her.  It was the first time that had ever happened to me at a restaurant. I understand the need and the want to leave once you're done your work shift but we were almost done and then it was like we were forgotten about for awhile and we had to wait a bit to pay even though it was in its \"quiet hours\".  I was also worried that someone else would get her tip although she had done most of the work, but there wasn't much I could do about it.  Other than that, the food was really delicious!  It was a good sized portion.  We were pretty hungry so we shared each other's dishes.  I got the poutine, he got the burger- it was all pretty great!  So, minus that little bump in service that was just more confusing than anything- I would go back if I was in the area- but there are too many restos around there to choose from, so it probably won't be high on my priority list of places to go again."}
{"text":"Something is wrong with management in this place. Service was slow because 1 waitress was serving the entire 20 tables in the place. I don't blame her, she was running all round the place and she did the best she could. But she was obviously overly stressed and making everyone in the room uncomfortable.  I ordered the Poutine Quebecoise and the Mozza burger. The poutine was fine but I don't know how they have the audacity to charge 5.95 +tx for this excuse of a burger. I could get something 10 times from the frozen lunch section at a grocery store.  Nothing in my experience would make me want to come again."}
{"text":"When I went to vacation in Montréal I was looking for \"regular food\" for québécois so someone refer me to this area to find one, then I found this place. It looks almost the same as American breakfast place so it feels very home but serving Quebec breakfast/brunch. For non-local you should order the smoked pork sandwich with fries, you must change it to poutine. Then you can have all at least two Quebec's unique food at one time. The time I ordered this, black coffee, and one shot of double espresso they were less than $25, so about $20 US dollar. However they don't serve latte."}
{"text":"Breakfast at Fameux Viande Fumee Et Charcuterie is very average and limited in variety. It's just your typical eggs with meat and toast, coffee and juice. There are no pancakes or omelettes so if that's what you want then this isn't the spot. The location of the restaurant is perfectly central and the place is well-kept."}
{"text":"Used to come here after nights of partying on the Montreal Plateau (particularly at the now-defunct \"Bleu Est Noir\"). Open 24hrs is perfect for party-goers. Very good home-style food. They have poutine here which absolutely awesome - you have to try the \"gratinée\", which is essentially stick it in the oven once it's ready so it broils over a bit. The absolute best! Pricing is great, as you won't generally pay 15$ for anything in there, and most times your bill will be under 10. Not necessarily a family place, not the kind of place that has McDonald's written all over it, this is more of a diner rather than a restaurant. Awesome place, service is always kind and efficient (and bilingual). A staple of the Plateau for many years."}
{"text":"Is it possible that the \"Nighthawks\" is inspired by Fameux? Maybe, most maybe not. In any case I'm giving four stars for the poutine (my favorite is la québécoise), the corner location (great for people watching), the old school feel, value for money and the friendly service. Ok, the other items on their menu aren't superb, but it's not the kind of restaurant that you go for some kind of unique gastronomic experience. Know that when you walk in, you'll see a lot of choices; not all of them good, not all of them are made with the finest ingredients (if any?), but most of them will probably satisfy your hunger and some will actually be surprisingly good (like the foie de boeuf). Personally I do hope places like Fameux will always be around. The Plateau will be so dull otherwise!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, this place can be the funniest brunch experience or the worst experience ever, it really depends on how you take it.  There are some rules to remember of course. When you walk in the door, don't expect much of customer service or someone to say hello and take you to your table. Just walk in, find a clean looking table and have a seat, the menus (there are few) can be found somewhere around the restaurant. It may be a while until someone will come to take your order, so make sure you bring a good book to read or a your favorite friend to talk to. I've seen some couples walking out after  10 minutes of waiting, I personally was just eager to taste the food and didn't mind a long wait.  The food is okay. I should say breakfast food is okay. I found it pretty funny how the jam was on top of my eggs (in the middle of my plate) and overall presentation of the meal I received. But, you don't come here for the food or customer service, it's an experience.  The atmosphere reminded me of going back in time, it has this retro vibe going on for sure, makes you feel like you're in a movie.   I give it a solid 3 star rating, I personally enjoyed my breakfast there, not so much the food but mostly, I will repeat again, the experience. Oh, and the best part is that it won't break your budget at all, probably the cheapest breakfast I've seen in Montreal."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent service. Fast and good food by a staff that's on. I have been here twice and each time walk away happy.    This is a classic diner, with classic diner food as well as Quebecois favorites like smoked meat and poutine - nothing particularly fancy or amazing, just good solid food and fast.  I walked in on a Friday night at 6:45. The place was packed, I was seated and had my food in about 7 minutes. They impress."}
{"text":"I cannot even comment on the food because my friends and I left after 15 minutes of waiting. First, this is a dine-in restaurant. Not sure if there is a cultural difference in timing, but nobody had us seated and offered a menu. There was clear unfair treatment, based on the homogenized customer demographics present at the restaurant compared to us. We waited about 15 minutes, but the older server who clearly noticed us and made eye contact, would not want to serve us. It was very obvious when we saw her immediately serve a group of new customers who came in AFTER us. At that moment, we decided to silently leave. The server's coworker tried to get her to serve us but she refused. I believe the manager was around and did not do anything either. The server just shrugged her shoulders when we left. I am highly appalled with this treatment. The server's young coworker tried hard to get her to serve us, but she had other customers. What a shame. Treat everyone equally. Thank you."}
{"text":"Although the place looks like one of those places that are trying to do everything from Chinese to american and Italian I still needs to admit they make a very good poutine. They also have good brunch or should I say breakfast (served all day) deals. I was not a fan of the atmosphere since it feels like a chain restaurant and not an establishment but still a good food option."}
{"text":"J'ai pris la poutine diablo en format grand et elle était très petite, mon plat pour emporter était peu rempli. Par contre délicieuse pizza aux champignons  miam"}
{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen, Mesdames et Messieurs, we have a winner!  In my decidedly unscientific poutine crawl in Montreal, my favorite experience was here at Fameux.  The place does a lively business but that doesn't stop the lady at the front from being so friendly and welcoming.  It was great just meeting here.  In addition to that, the food was amazing!  I, of course, had poutine.  I got the smoked meat variety since they are known for that.  My buddy got a smoked meat sandwich, with fries and gravy.  He put his first fry in the gravy and after tasting it, said I'd love it and he was not wrong.    The smoked meat itself was perfect...moist without being greasy.  Tender and flavorful.  It was heaven.  But what sent it to the stratosphere for me was the gravy.  There was some flavor in there...a spice or something..I couldn't put my finger on it but it added a little \"zing\" to the proceedings.  I loved it.    Washing it down with a tap beer (I think they told me it was made by Molson, I could be wrong) was a delightful way to spend an afternoon.  This gets the highly coveted award of \"Bill's Favorite Poutine in Montreal\"."}
