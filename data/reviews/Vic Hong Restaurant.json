{"text":"This place is has a nice interior with dark wooden walls and large Asian vases around the front bar.  It looks a lot nicer compared to other Vietnamese places which are usually pretty bare/simple.  Perhaps this is making up for its lacklustre food. 
I had the BBQ chicken with a spring roll on vermicelli that comes with a small bowl of fish sauce on the side.  The chicken and spring rolls fine. It was the vermicelli was lumped together so it seemed as though it was sitting there for awhile and the fish sauce was bland.  While I always ask for a second bowl, I almost wanted a 3rd one because I couldn't really taste it. 
I didn't think this place is great but my friend that brought me here comes all the time so maybe it's just what I ordered. 

PS - service was sufficient."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner on a weeknight and was not impressed. 

We ordered: 
- bun bo hue: flavour was okay, nothing special, but the noodles were overcooked 
- curry chicken noodle: the vermicelli was WAY overcooked to the point where it became mush. Soup was lacking flavour

Service was friendly but the food was just not good. I don't recommend this restaurant unless you really really crave Viet food..."}
{"text":"tastless pho soup, small portion.  Not a good experience."}
{"text":"Came in on a weekday and it was not busy at all. There was two servers working.

My friends wanted to order some pho and some cooked dishes. The server told us that the chef who is responsible for the cooked/grilled items is NOT HERE at the restaurant yet, so we cannot order any grilled/cooked items until another half hour ...

Therefore, we could only order the usual pho items.

We ordered a curry noodle soup, a bun bo hue noodle soup, and some appetizers.

The items are overpriced here and there is barely any meat. The appetizers are tiny for the price you pay.

Don't think I will be returning to pay for overpriced vietnamese dishes that is just average quality."}
{"text":"I ordered a special pho, came fast and hot, however, I find the pho noodle too soft and overdone. Soup doesn't seemed like it has a lot of MSG, so that's a plus. But overall, I would go somewhere else for pho, cause it's very average and noodle is overdone."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place gets low reviews. This is one my favorite Vietnamese places. I drive all the way from North York to get here. Their BBQ pork over rice is a deal at under $10. The food tastes less greasy and higher quality ingredients then other Pho restaurants."}
{"text":"A disappointing place for pho or Vietnamese food. Never had I ever experienced eating a worse pho in my life. The soup base was not flavourful nor had a taste that resembles pho. And the meat, I think I counted maybe 6 pieces of meat in my bowl.  If they can't master pho or even have something that resembles it, which is a Vietnamese staple, they should pack up shop, for they will ruin someone's first experience of falling in love with pho.

I left this place seething mad inside, I felt cheated after eating here, that's how bad it was."}
{"text":"The quantity of food was pretty small compare to other pho place. Especially the meat. And the meat has the old meat with freezer burn smell and taste. The fried wanton from the appetizer has so tiny fillings in them."}
{"text":"Look, if you're coming here to eat some pho, go somewhere else lol. The pho here is tasteless, bland, and the noodles are really soggy. That being said, their vermicelli dishes are pretty good. They have the best spring rolls I've eaten for a Viet restaurant (i THINK they put taro in them or more meat). Chicken and meats are grilled okay (it's edible) and they give you a HUUUGE portion of veggies under the noodles (sticks together and really clumpy sadly). And it comes with peanuts on top (so if you're allergic, make sure you write on your order, NO PEANUTS). Their nuoc mam is okay, kinda sweet? It's an okay restaurant if you don't eat the pho."}
{"text":"They do something amazing with the white radish in their broth, best assorted beef pho I've had. Service was pretty prompt for a Sunday lunch and price was very reasonable. Lovely decor (see photo). If you get the seat next to the fishtank it's very fun watching them swim."}
{"text":"I've tried their Bun - vermicelli with BBQ chicken and spring roll served in a bowl and Rice dishes mixed vegetables with chicken (chinese style). 

Solid and consistently good each time I've gone without any long wait times. So I'm questioning the prior reviews.

The wooden decor here is nice with each table having a unique  ornamental display inset on the table."}
{"text":"I have never had pho where the broth tasted exactly like campbells beef broth with a hint of mint. Very disappointing. Noodles were overcooked and soggy. Only good thing were the beef balls. My hubby had the bun and it was averaged. Not great, not terrible. Wont be returning."}
{"text":"Too bad there is no negative rating. I ordered two noodles and waited over half an hour, so then I asked the waiter for a follow up. Shortly the waiter  came with the wrong order, he took it back then we waited for another 10 mins yet again with a wrong order. I told the waiter that it was wrong and she proceeded to challenge me with my order sheet and the menu. Turned out I wrote down the correct order."}
{"text":"2 stars seems a bit harsh for this place but for sure I have experienced better than what they serve here. I have to say they have a better interior than the decent pho spots I've been in, but I guess they have to have that edge knowing that their dishes are inferior.

I've been here a few times because it's close by and I don't find the phos that terrible to be honest. If you want to try this place out, just lower your expectations, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for lunch and the food, service, design and atmosphere was all pretty good.

I had the special pho bowl with the mixed beef, tripe, beef balls and bean sprouts with the my tho/mei tho/glass noodles (although I've tasted better glass noodles in pho) instead of the typical rice noodles and the portion served for the regular size was perfect in my opinion. Of course, it could vary between days and different chefs too but when I went it was a good portion of everything including the noodles which is not often to come by! Many other pho places usually give a large portion of noodles and smaller portions of the meat and other condiments. The broth used was tasty and not as oily or heavy either which was great!

Service was good and everything arrived in a timely manner. The only thing I didn't like so much was how the door was positioned and facing majority of the tables so if any customers were to walk in, a freezing draft would also come in as well. It is winter afterall!"}
{"text":"This place is great!!! Their broth is homemade! I ordered their pho and there was an underlying daikon taste and the soup was actually made from scratch; you can feel bits of braised meat as you drink down the soup- not the nasty MSG/ powder stuff!!

I also ordered their bun no hue- it was pretty spicy! It had bits of braised beef and Vietnamese sausage! 

I agreed with the other reviewers that the meat portions were small but it's about quality over quantity! I love their broth so much that i'm ok with it.

Service was nice and quick. It's owned by an Asian guy and few other employees that took our order. 

Price was decent ($7.95 for the noodles and a dollar more for a large size) and I was full! I like the place and I would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Great food at a low price. Try the hot and sour soup #200, the service is lacking but the food partly makes up for if. Worth a visit if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"This is not authentic at all. Very confusing menu, spicy pho did not taste like it should at all. Bo kho was a clear broth! The only thing good was the chicken curry and bread and avocado milkshake. There is too many good viet restos to ever come back here. Decor was very Vietnamese though, lol....that's about it."}
{"text":"Was back here tonight and I love it even more. One of the best bbq pork chops and rice Vietnamese style. And this time the spring rolls were perfect.

Also, as your beverage get the strawberry juice crushed ice. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Vietnamese restaurants uptown. The decor is rather odd, but if you ignore that, the dishes (that I've tried so far) are really good. The pho has a unique flavour, the bun bo hue has just the right amount of spice, and the prices are fair for the portions they give.

Staff are attentive, but the kitchen can be quite slow during peak hours. They have a pretty big menu so there's something for everyone. Their dishes and utensils also seem very clean.

Vic Hong is the only restaurant I'd recommend in Markham and Richmond Hill. There are at least four other Viet restaurants in our area (near Markville Mall), but we always make the drive to this place whenever we crave pho or bun bo hue."}
{"text":"Food quality has definitely improved this year, but the service is as slow as always. I personally like their pho more than the pho made at the Xe Lua nearby (and their service albeit slow is also better). However, the price IS more expensive than Xe Lua. Not sure how I feel about that just yet."}
{"text":"Come here for the chicken wings and their vermicelli (they use the thin vermicelli, not the medium thickness) and BBQ. They have excellent BBQ and freshly made shrimp on sugar cane (not frozen). It's family owned and usually under staffed as it can get busy. The owners are Chinese but from Vietnam. Their pho is ok, order the BBQ instead"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday. I was pretty surprised on how good the food was. I was expecting pretty run down food. But the place decor was really nice and clean. Service was excellent. The food came our really quick too. I had the Won Ton Noodle Soup. So delicious and hot! I would come back here to try out their other menu!"}
{"text":"I'm quite surprised Vic hong only has 2.5 stars. I love coming here for their BBQ vermicelli with pork, since the pork is seasoned just right and they give you a big portion for the price!! I also tried their pho today, and soup base was very flavourful and the beef was very soft. I couldn't really ask for much more! Sure the service can be lacking sometimes but I keep coming back for the food."}
{"text":"I'm a very picky with Pho. The soup must come steaming hot, has to taste authentic/homemade, the meats fresh (raw or cooked) and noodles must be the thin kind. Vic Hong does most of it well, except the soup part. I'm not a fan of their soup. It taste all right and looks homemade, but just doesn't knock the ball out the park. There's something missing in their soup, something I haven't experienced since I visited a west end Vietnamese restaurant. The noodles are always super soft, which is another thing I don't like. The meat, however, is always fresh.. Especially the raw beef. Unfortunately, the soup is never hot enough and it takes forever for it to cook in the soup.

First world food problems... Lol"}
{"text":"I've been here many times, even when they were located at Leslie and Hwy 7. 
The owner and servers are the same now that they've moved. 

The noodles and broth have always been quite tasty. Homemade Viet beef broth (you can taste the lemongrass and whatnots). The noodles had always been a nice chewy texture and the raw beef always fresh. Topped off with a stewed turnip (very yummy). They've always added the bean sprouts in the noodle since the beginning. So if you don't want any you'd have to let them know. 

I agree with some of my fellow Yelpers, that they've changed. 
The soup now tastes more like the pre-made Costco broths. (Noted not one drop of oil), and the noodles are more soft. 

Today I came by with the hubby and he agreed that food wise it's def changed. 

Service has always been the same, same couple of older gents. What we always find interesting is the raw beef noodles and the cold noodles always take the longest to arrive. 

I'm a bit disappointed, cause like I said always been coming to the same restaurant. Sad it's going the wrong direction."}
{"text":"Seems like more of a Chinese joint than Vietnamese, but they've been around for a while so locals must like it. 

As previous reviews noted, broth is flavorful and not too fatty, but I found it odd that they put the bean sprouts and basil into your soup for you. Also no lime or hot chilis are provided. The hoisin sauce on the table looked watered down. 
BBQ Pork chop and shrimp on rice was well done - nice grill and well seasoned. Prices are reasonable. 

Service was brisk and attentive. No complaints there. Washroom was clean. 

Overall nothing too special but if you want some local Vietnamese food, can make a quick meal here."}
{"text":"This is a Chinese restaurant in disguise as a Pho restaurant. 

Pho broth isn't authentic-tasting and has a weird smell to it. The beef sauté also had a weird smell but was spicy. 

Service was okay. Our waiter looked like he didn't want to be there. There was no music so we could just hear the two waiters talking to a person sitting at one of the back tables. Kind of awkward. 

I asked for bean sprouts and the waiter said they already put it in. I really wanted bean sprouts so he finally brought me some but there were steamed! The whole point of bean sprouts is to cool the hot soup.. They shouldn't be steamed already. 

The shrimp rolls were small and a bit hard but didn't taste too bad. 

My husband and I didn't even finish our soup and they didn't ask why. 

Wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"Perhaps the 'Chinese-y-est' Vietnamese restaurant I have ever been to.  I use the terms 'Vietnamese' and 'restaurant' very loosely.  I can see how a place like this would do well in Richmond Hill because the Chinese like to support their own, even if it means getting 'Vietnamese' food that tasted Chinese.  I don't know if that even makes sense!  

The restaurant was busy on a Sunday night, and the service was very slow compared to other Vietnamese restaurants.  I figure the cooks were all looking at each other trying to figure out how cook the dish I ordered.  

I ordered the Pho Bo Kho, which is a staple beef stew noodle dish, made with meaty chunks of brisket.  The stew was actually a mixture of pho broth and something that tasted like coconut milk with a dash of chili oil.  This is NOTHING like what it is supposed to taste like.  Rather than chunks of beef, there were these little bits of beef, almost the size you would use for congee.  It was bizarre.

The deep fried spring rolls were neither here nor there, though the fish sauce it was served with was a bit diluted.  Even the hoisin sauce for the noodles were watered down.  

One good thing I guess -- they do accept credit cards.  A rarity for this food genre.  Honestly, one of the worst Vietnamese (or any type) of restaurants I've ever been to.  There are way better options in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"Their soup broth is amazing! Got the special pho soup (~$8) and it's an extra dollar for large. Very affordable and a generous portion!

Great comfort food for sure. Definitely would recommend!!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here regularly for a few years now. One of our favourite pho restaurants, so Im surprised at the poor reviews (Maybe because we usually order the same dishes everytime)

Their BBQ pork is probably the tastier ones Ive tried and their chicken wings are delicious. Consistent taste, good prices and quality."}
{"text":"Poo! I was craving pho for a really long time and not wanting to trek all the way to Scarborough to do so, I decided to try this new establishment. Let me tell you something, it did NOT satisfy my pho craving.

The noodles in my pho were ridiculously gummy and chewy. Basically it was undercooked. Uhhh, Vietnamese noodles are not supposed to be 'al-dente' like pasta is. If these noodles are undercooked, it tastes like flour and pasty and just uncomfortable in your mouth. 

The soup base wasn't great either and let's not even start with the decor. It was ghastly. I love pho and I can take it in many different styles, but this is one style that I will not be revisiting."}
{"text":"The menu was misleading. I should have asked the servers questions before ordering but I thought the BBQ pork and bean curd rice dish was pretty straightforward. I thought that it would be done Vietnamese style and I was looking forward to trying something new. I ended up getting a Chinese-style stir fry dish with tofu and BBQ pork (Chinese style), along with some stir fry veggies on the side. Nowhere on the menu did it say that there would be additional vegetables on the side. Despite the misleading menu, the portions were very generous and the dish itself was good overall. What was also notable was the fact that some rice dishes were more generous than others. Although all rice dishes at Vietnamese restaurants are generous overall (in my experience anyway), my boyfriend's grilled pork and egg cake rice dish was less generous than mine. 

The decor of the restaurant could be best described as resembling the inside of some vintage nautical-themed toy chest. There were sea stars and seashells lining the walls and there were a lot of wooden accents. Some of the tables were interesting. The table that we sat at was a glass table with a compartment underneath that contained an assortment of recipes on pie crusts, along with a silver bowl with iridescent glitter in it. Very interesting choice of decor. 

Vic Hong needs some improvement in terms of its cleanliness. I was not thrilled to discover that there was a centipede lurking under our table. It was a good thing that I was finished eating when I saw it! 

Would I come back here again? Not if I'm craving authentic Vietnamese food. Although the food was okay, the menus are misleading. If you do decide to come in for a visit, always ask the servers what will be in the dish."}
{"text":"Seems they cannot handle the max capacity. Expect to be waiting for your food for a while. If you in a rush, do not come here."}
{"text":"It's more of like a 3.5 now. But I had to drop it down by 0.5 in rating because I was absolutely disgusted by my recent visit. The food is still good, but it's just this one dude that like always throws me off. I get a weird vibe about him. Anyways, it's the tall and old dude that works there. Like I know it's hard to control, but basically he was like coughing out his flem or mucus in the bathroom (like how a lot of chinese people ((no offence)) do it;; ya know the EXTREMELY LOUD HUFF AND SPIT DEAR GOD ). It was REALLY LOUD (and plus it was early so there's like not that many people in the restaurant yet; it was legit dead quiet in the restuarant) and I was JUST brought my pho. So it's like .......... how do you expect me to still have an appetite after hearing such atrocity. It was like a war in there damn. 

Other than the guy, I feel like they should remove most of their drink options. They literally do not have a lot of them. Legit, all the things I asked for, they couldn't make. It's pointless to have it on the menu if they aren't going to make them."}
{"text":"Bbq chicken, bbq pork with vermicelli. Good portion. Nice setting with kind and fast service."}
{"text":"Pho is different than other places - i like! The bean sprouts came submerged under the soup. They dont give you a separate plate like other places. The menu is a little hard to understand.

The pho broth was really really flavourful. One of the best Ive tasted so far. The pho came with a soft wedge of broiled radish that was tasty. The broth came super hot and piping, it was great.

I had the special combination which had some pieces of raw beef to cook in the broth. It was so tender and tasty. 

My friend had bbq chicken pho. The charred bbq was tasty too!"}
{"text":"Fatty pho soup, noodles not cooked well. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times with a friend of mine and tried their pho.

Seated right away. Their chairs are not the most comfortable, and the tables are often sticky. The times I went, there were flies buzzing around and strangers were seated next to you.

Amazing price for such a large portion. Didn't taste too bad at all, but didn't have a lot of meat in it at all. I'm sure they're cutting back because the meat hadn't started disappearing until my 3rd time there; although it took a really long time to get to my table. - Around 45 minutes.  My friend started talking about how people that came in and ordered after us got their food first. - 

I was considering leaving 25 minutes in, but I didn't want to wait at another restaurant.

Cheap, terrible service but not the worst I've had.

2/5"}
{"text":"Probably the worst pho I've ever had.  Dropped in for a quick lunch with my mom and we both ordered brisket and tendon pho.  When our food arrived without the usual side of bean sprouts, lime, thai basil, we should have known that this meal was not going to be what we expected.  

The broth was super sweet and lacked any Vietnamese spice/seasoning.  The noodles were overcooked and just fell apart in the mouth.  It was the most off-putting noodle soup eating experience in my life.  

About half an hour after eating, my mom got sick and threw up.  Enough said.  Will NEVER  go back here."}
{"text":"ORDER NUMBER 53, decently spicy but AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS. No debit/visa tho :/ and decently friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Sucks!

I ordered vermicelli dish, I was served with instant vermicelli noodles that were cut into 2 halves (square).

I am just saying, if you ran out of ingredients, just tell the customer first before substituting.

Very unprofessional!

Don't waste your hard-earned $$$ here."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute JOKE! I had a tomato based beef brisket noodle, my friend had a satay beef noodle. We couldn't tell the difference between 2 soup and both soup base was diluted.  When I asked how come there's no bean sprouts? They told me they were already in the soup?! Then I asked for more, they gave me cooked one?! What type of Viet restaurant uses COOKED bean sprouts? The waiter even said... \"cooked is better than uncooked.. safer hehe\".. I was speechless.  I guess they don't have \"fresh\" bean sprouts to provide.

Number ONE worst Vietnamese restaurant in my opinion.  Even my friend's mom makes better Pho than they do..."}
{"text":"Vic Hong is one of my favorite places to frequent.  A great combination of quality ingredients and reasonable price has me coming back here regularly.  Service is quick and prompt, and there's a lot of variety on the menu.  Other Vietnamese places load up too much MSG, and though they may seem more flavorful, they offer a not so sustainable diet.  Vic Hong is a very sustainable diet place; I could eat here every night and not feel the nasty ding of MSG affect my belly bellz."}
{"text":"Hungry and not familiar with the area and it was pretty late. Saw this Vietnamese restaurant still have some numbers of customers so we decided to give it a try.

I always play safe if I visit a new restaurant that I never been to or checking their review before hand. We ordered spring rolls, special beef noodles in soup and prok chop on rice. These are pretty safe dishes that hardly goes wrong. Well I was wrong...

Spring rolls were all burnt. The reason because the oil was too hot and also the spring roll was forzen and defrosted many times so the wrap was stick to each other and breaks the wrapping skin so the over heat oil went in to burn all the filling.

The prok chop on rice comes with feel pieces of pork chops. However the thickness were so much different. The thin one was so dry and over cooked make you feel like eating meat jerky. The thick one was also dry but under cook to a point that it was raw instead of rare. These prok chop for sure cook before hand and keep in the fridge(hopefully) for a long time and reheat with microwave.

The beef noodle in soup was the best out of the worst. The fully loaded MSG soup was hot enough to cook the raw beef. However the noodle was so over cook  that make you feel like eating baby food.

This is the first time and will be my last time visit, don't know why they have so many customers on a late Monday night...."}
{"text":"Mediocre pho restaurant. Ate here a few times in the past year and was not impressed every time. It's one of the few Vietnamese restaurants in the area, would not want to visit again. Last time my boyfriend ordered the curry chicken noodle soup, once he has informed the waiter that the chicken was not cooked through, he took the bowl to the back and came back with the same bowl after he took it out go the microwave. We didn't bother eating any more of it. Not good."}
{"text":"The food takes a while to make but it's worth it. My problem is the customer service. We ordered 3 of the exact same curry dishes. We received 2 of them and kept inquiring about the 3rd. I got to the point where I had to get out of my seat and approach the server. I asked him how much longer till it would come and he just nodded his head and walked away. 20 minutes later we get the dish. 


Not impressed at all. This spot has great food but they really need to improve their customer service.  

Would i recommend anyone to eat here? Of course!!! The quality is amazing"}
{"text":"Slow service. Cancelled my order because other people at my table got their food in advance and the other tables that came in after all got their food. 

Got a really pitiful apology and left hungry.

Probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Since there are more Vietnamese Pho places opening in the area, I would expect it should improve to compete in the market. However, I am kinda of disappointed to see they are going to the other direction. 

They have one main waiter now and the kitchen service is very slow in a quiet afternoon. 

Food is very bland and doesn't taste authentic anymore. Smoothie is very watery. Mostly likely, I won't go back."}
{"text":"Decor is interesting and staff is nice but in terms of food quality it deserves a 2 star. 

(I have heard a lot of good things about them so maybe I didn't order the right things. Will give them another shot sometime.)

There are plenty of alternatives that are better either Chinese food or Vietnam food.      I would think their dishes are more from a Chinese background and they picked up covering vietnam food. 

We ordered the lemon grass chicken dry noodle and a stir fry veggie rice noodle. The lemon grass chicken was pretty good but the spring rolls had a lot of fillers (think it was potato or something). The stir fry veggie rice noodle portion was huge and somewhat tasty. We are not sure if it is related but gf wasn't feeling too well after her dish although I felt fine and had some of her stir fry dish.

There are a lot of regulars here so there are actually lines waiting for seats spring regular dinner hours."}
{"text":"Waiter was very polite to us. I quite like their beef broth, strong beef flavor, tasted real and not full of MSG. I feel like they are using fresh vermicelli instead of dried. Tasted similar to the ones I tried in Vietnam. The only thing is the raw beef, not fresh enough, don't recommend to order."}
{"text":"In this general area there are two other places - a Chinese restaurant that doesn't take credit cards - that sign almost slaps you (metaphorically) in the face as you walk in - food looks good but the taste is BLAND.    The other is Thai Basil.  Thai Basil's tag line reads \"Thai Chefs.  Thai Food.  Thai Taste.\"  (... but not Thai wait staff ...   chuckle).  We like the quality and freshness of Thai Basil but the portions are small and the prices are high - rather poor value when trying to feed a family of four.  

So starts this review of Vic Hong - as Neil T mentioned - \"Perhaps the 'Chinese-y-est' Vietnamese restaurant I have ever been to\" and we tend to agree somewhat.  Where as there are more Caucasians in Thai Basil, here the entire clientele leans toward Chinese along with the wait staff.  Vietnamese food leaning toward Chinese style - I guess.  

Note - if authentic Vietnamese is your specialty/goal and this place doesn't pass the sniff test, then this review will be of no value to you.  We rate this based on what we get from this location and have enjoyed the offerings mostly so far.  Please note also that I have not tried the Pho - I noticed one family of three - adults had the Pho and the child had a plate of chicken wings.  I guess I am that fool that orders a steak in an Italian restaurant and one wonders what went wrong?  We are no authority on Vietnamese cuisine.

Flavor/freshness/quality - we will seek out other Vietnamese places but like what we get here.  Also I have found (warning - generalization) - that a lot of Vietnamese places lean toward pho --- and so far of a lean that there isn't much of anything else.  I don't mind the pho dishes at these places (rare beef, pork, chicken etc etc) - the rest of the family is not interested in that.

When I was dating my wife - we hit this place (by name only or a chain .. related.unrelated - dunno) at the location in Scarberia - Sheppard and Brimley after going with a high school friend.  The meal didn't go well.  Years later - one opens up beside the said high school on what used to be the Palmer family farm.  We did a take out about a year ago with much success and then we did another take out a few weeks before this visit.  During that last take out, I chose a deep fried squid dish - it was no different than an average Chinese (Western) take out and would pass on that next time.  (Sam Woo BBQ - Bamborough Circle has an awesome Salty Spicy Deep Fried Squid item ... the search for an equivalent dish outside Sam Woo continues ...).  

Our visit on this evening mostly replicated the main dishes we picked up during the last take out, as they were very good.    Deep fried spring roll (#33) - with pork - was good; shrimp wonton (#32) very good.  Mains included Chicken and Vegetables on Rice (#121) - fair amount of chicken.  BBQ Pork on Vermicelli (#76) - see value below.   BBQ Beef with Vietnamese noodles - this was $3.50 more than #76 - generally with more meat as well.  We loved the meats - well cooked and esp love the BBQ flavor.  Overall a good selection.  No doggie bag.  Tea was provided - no charge and we did not venture into any dessert (we hit the new Ten Ren for drinks after). 

They have a sort of vinegary sauce - wife suggests something else - sweet.  Very good though - nice when you put over the noodles, plain rice or anything else.  

I tend to agree with some that the portions are a bit small.  You get a fair amount of noodles with a few strips of meat.  One could include this place into that debate along with Thai Basil.  The $11.50 dish definitely had more meat though than the $7.95 (#76) dish.    

If it is a once in a while take out or dine in - then based on the quality I can live with the value side.  Unfortunately, however, we couldn't make this a regular take out place due to the value.

** We are out of hot water!!!
Based on the state of the men's washroom I would normally yank a star - no hot water at all (doesn't work) and the paper towel is a roll into a sheet dispenser - so it is at best difficult to get paper towel.  Bad enough that I disliked going at the end to wash my hands before leaving.  Others reading this - if this does not improve - please yank a star and mention that too.  Meanwhile the women's washroom - the hot water works.

Probably more of a 3.5 than 4 IMO.  Will amend as life goes on.

{"text":"The BBQ on rice is good, but the portion you get it ridiculous.  Wish I took a picture.  For $7.25 you get a lot of rice and 1 piece of pork, and it was small and thin.  I typically share with my 2 year son BBQ pork on rice at other vietnamese restaurants and I usually get 2 pieces.  After I cut the pork for my son, I literally had 2 bites for myself and a whole lotta rice.

Their pho was ok, my wife said it didn't really taste like pho but it wasn't bland."}
{"text":"There are 3 Pho restaurants I would recommend going in the Richmond Hill/Markham area, and this is definitely my #1 choice.

When I go for pho, I pretty much 95% of the time order a raw beef noodle, so I'll be using this as a reference to compare all the Pho places I go.

The key winning factor here is the taste. Although the beef quantity isn't that much, the soup base is superb, and there's a fair amount of noodles. One nice little touch I like about this place that others don't have is that they add in a pretty big piece of raddish which I love, especially after they absorb the soup taste.

Definitely the place to go for pho if you want a good tasting bowl of pho."}
{"text":"Been here at least 3 times already and it does not disappoint. Both the pho and the vermicelli selections are very good. The decor is nice, they have put some thought and effort into it. No, the service is not too friendly but they take the order and bring the food quickly so it's something you can overlook."}
{"text":"Im iffy about this place. They put a huge radish in the pho which I've never seen before.

The broth was quite clear and tasty however. Also, the other unorthodox thing they did was serve the pho with bream sprouts and the basil in the soup.

The fried spring rolls was nice and crispy which was great
