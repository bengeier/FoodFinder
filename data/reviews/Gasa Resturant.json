Date visited : Tues April 24th 2018

Had just come back from Brampton after dealing with a client's computer woes.

Did not feeling like cooking, so wife and I decided to grab some Chicken Biryani, some veggie spring rolls, some chicken patties and a few fish patties.  We were recommended to Gasa by a friend who is also a Yelper.

Service : well due to the line up the service times were kinda on the slow side, a lot of people were placing orders.  This resto is purely take out only, no dining area at all.  

Food : Chicken Biryani I'd give 5/5, and I'm by no means an expert on the dish, just that this has been our 3rd time trying the dish, we had previously tasted 2 other locations and this has been the best one for us.  In future tho, likely to skip the spring rolls and the chicken/fish patties, cheap tho they may be, those items just weren't up our alley.

Payment method : cash/debit, uncertain about credit card as of this writing.

Repeat visit : we'll gladly be back for the Chicken Biryani, and I'm interested to try the Chicken Kothu Roti.

Hehe apologies for no pictures, we were famished when we arrived home with the biryani.  Will take snaps on the the next time we order :)"}
{"text":"I called and he told me it will be done at 10 min, went to the store , wasn't ready , waited for 20 min . The gravy taste very old , it has no mutton or chicken in , I will never Order from this place ."}
{"text":"Delicious food but service is a little odd. No menu but prices are very good.

We had the chicken and mutton kothu rotis and 3 mutton rolls for 16 flat.

I suggest a mutton roll to try but otherwise, the kothu rotis were super tasty.

Beware because they use a lot of green chilies.

No sitting room so take out only!"}
{"text":"Havent really been introduced to Tamil food until last year. Knew about babu's but never went. I heard really good things about the Kottu Roti at Gasa; had to try it out. Pretty good. The chilli chicken is my favourite one as it is different from other tamil dive ins that i have tasted. They are very affordable. 


However; i just ordered the chicken biryani. Even though they are very generous with their portion . Lots of chicken and rice. It failed to capture the same taste as Suvaiyakam Restaurant down at Birchmount and Finch who also offer a veg and salad (which Gasa didnt). No complaints as it was ok. It tasted a bit like hakka. 

Chilli Chicken Kottu Roti will be my staple item at this location. Cant knock it till you try it. I am the one who knocks!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The mutton kothu is a must try! Mutton rolls are also amazing. Mithi vedi is to die for!"}
{"text":"FOOD: I come here often and order food. Usually the vegetarian kothurothi and appetizers such as rolls, vadai, spring rolls and more! Amazing kothurothi and you can ask them to make it spicy or less spicy depending on what you like. They have a variety of food and a lot of vegetarian options. One kothuroti can feed up to 1 to 2 people. 

PLACE: Small place made for takeout or catering. CALL IN AND ORDER if you don't want to be stuck waiting in line. They are the busiest on Fridays and the weekends. 

PRICE: $-$$ cheap and affordable! One kothurothi costs only $5"}
{"text":"Horrible service before we even walked in. Asked if they were open and said they were closed. We checked the website and the site indicates they close at 11pm when we called at 1030pm.  To me this doesn't leave a good impression on hungry people."}
{"text":"So I had their chilli chicken kothu last night.... And had a stomachache since. It wasn't only me, but all 4 of my other friends who had the same thing are sick too. TBH it tasted really good, but definitely not worth the food poisoning. So all in all, if you need a doctor's note or you got commitments to dodge the next day, this is your spot."}
