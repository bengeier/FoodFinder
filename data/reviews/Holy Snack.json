{"text":"Ordered from Uber. Peach ice tea was really nice and refreshing. Really liked it. However viet coffee was not the strong coffee taste I was expecting that I usually get at a normal Vietnamese restaurant. It tasted more like instant Korean coffee mix. I would skip on the viet coffee next time. Also got Viet sandwiches - BBQ pork and shredded pork. Both were pretty good but again not the taste I expected like from a Vietnamese restaurant. It's a fusion place and not an authentic Vietnamese restaurant so my expectation of Vietnamese food was not very high in the first place - I am content with the food for an Asian fusion place. 

Food was packaged well for Uber delivery but the coffee didn't have a stopper for the lid so it did leak a little bit during delivery.

I would definitely try other drinks from here next time."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the Bahn Mi's were very dry and not up to par. The service  was great and their other sweet desserts and smoothies look good however i was disappointed in the viet sandwiches. This place is new and hopefully they tweak their food over time. I will come back and try them again after they've been in business a while longer and hopefully it improves. I plan to go back to try their smoothies very soon as they use almond milk only which i really like."}
{"text":"Around 10:30 am, I decided I wanted pho for lunch so I get on the ubereats app to order but it says they open at 12:00 pm. I wait until 1200 pm to get back on the app to order but now  it says \"Currently Unavailable\". I wait and wait and wait and around 12:15 pm, I'm able to place my order. i place it and it keeps saying it's waiting for the restaurant to confirm my order... nothing happens and my order expires. I place the order again and the same thing happened. I tried calling the restaurant 6 times and no answer. 

Terrible service. just terrible. I wanted to try holy snack for the first time but i will never step foot or try this restaurant ever. I spent way too much time on this."}
{"text":"As I promised in my last review, I came back here again today :) Got their banh mi (shredded chicken) this time. It did not disappoint - big, fresh and tasty - probably the tastiest sandwich I had in a while. Liked the sauce too (I think it was avocado but no so sure)

I am also glad to see that the food court was busy, which is a good sign. Definitely a good place to grab lunch. :)"}

The owners are very polite and they are quite attentive to the tiny details. They were eager to improve any of their flavours.

This place just opened up so they're still tweaking the menu. They have a lot of interesting desserts from durian crepes to Thai tea cream puffs.  

I got to try their thai iced tea, which has a good amount of flavour without being overly sweet. They had some savoury 'cupcakes' with salted egg and pork meat floss. A definitely interesting style of cupcake. 

The price is reasonable compared to other dessert and smoothie stores. 

The decor is nice. The menus are easy to read. There are no seats inside, as it is part of a food court.

I would recommend this place and I think I'll come back sometime in the future. I look forward to all sorts of new items to try."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the Bahn Mi (made with care instead of slapped together at the speed of light) and their egg yolk cupcakes.  All of them taste superb.

They have a lot of unique offerings from mango crepes, durian pudding, to egg rolls.  I would go back often just to try them all and the owners are very friendly.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is the biggest flop. 

We went there twice during the weekend and they're always close even it says open everywhere (from the website to Yelp). Never try again!!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ordered Saigon rolls, Thai mango salad, char siu and assorted banh mi, and Viet coffee through Foodora to have on our binge of Blacklist on Netflix. It really hit the spot!

Opening the delivery, I could tell everything was packaged and put together with care. The salad and rolls were beautifully presented/preserved and the sandwiches themselves didn't look too shabby either.

First bite into the sandwich, I could tell the ingredients were quite fresh and appeared true to the construction of this classic staple. Bread wasn't stiff, but supple and soft. Pickled daikons and carrots still had a nice crunch, with no wilted cilantro. Pate and mayo generously lined and not overbearing. Overall, sandwiches passed muster. However, the level of quality was not quite enough to justify the price which is double those of Ba Le and Nguyen Huong. Maybe I'm missing something, but there is nothing apparent to me that is extraordinary about these sandwiches that could substantiate its overinflated pricepoint.  I would like to see more customization options (a spicy/chili variant? option to add fried quail eggs?).

I was seriously impressed by the Saigon rolls and Thai mango salad. The rolls were a nicely chewy, delicious envelopes of hardboiled quail egg halves, jerky, dried shrimp, mango slaw among other things---a unique combination that captured my interest. The mango salad was exciting as well, with the dried shrimp, raw onion, crispy deep fried scallions, cilantro, and mango slaw. Very exciting and fresh flavours. Just on these two offerings alone, I sense there's a huge potential in Holy Snack. Definitely planning on making another round some time with further exploration into their many smoothie/drinks from which I expect to find more unique combinations."}
{"text":"Delicious signature spring roll with the jerky and quail egg. A small counter in a food court."}
