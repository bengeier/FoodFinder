{"text":"Great service!! Servers are so nice and food is excellent. My favorite so far is the lemon pepper and the waffle with the butter syrup.  We'll be going back to try the other flavors."}
{"text":"THE BEST wings I've ever had! Blows buffalo barf wings (bww) out the water! They even taste good the next day! Lol just keepin it real ppl"}
{"text":"I don't want to make any accusations, but I woke up with a wicked stomach flu/food poisoning/gastroenteritis. The last and only thing I ate yesterday was a bunch of traditional hot wings, celery, ranch, and mac & cheese. I feel like I'm dying.  Chicken quality didn't seem good. Seemed like they were dry or old or recently frozen. The meat was tough and too chewy. Sauce was typical quality from any wing place.  The macaroni was small in piece size. The portion was fine but the individual macaroni size was tiny. I never had mac that small. Cheese sauce was decent. Saw some black spots in my mac and cheese. I'm guessing it was burn marks or something."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. The waitress never acknowledged us and totally ignored us. She had a bad attitude when we asked her where to place the order since it was our first time. Very disappointed. Definitely customer service is not there priority. I'm forcefully giving them a one star in order to put in a review."}
{"text":"Man if you haven't tried the Wing King's chicken, buddy you are missing out! He's got over 80 original flavors from peach cobbler to Strawberry Shortcake. If you are a fan of hot, make sure to sign the contract because he's got an atomic chicken challenge that will shorly make you wanna put your tongue out. Some Will Survive the most will fail. When it comes to chicken this guy is the master of all flavors make sure you stop by shooters and try The Wing king delicious masterpiece."}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem on Yelp.  I'm from California the wing capital and we don't have nothing on this spot. It's in the cut, combined w a bar and very friendly. Over 50+ options in wing flavors plus unique twists. Plus you can bottle flavors to go. Found a new spot.... Plus the ladies are amazing especially \"Brittany\"!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what's going on with all the great reviews on this place Decore  is cold and I guess they're going for a stoners design. I went there about 8pm ordered the fried cauliflower it was OK 2 pounds of wings hot and extra extra extra well done I actually told the waitress make them close to burnt.  when the wings came out They we're barely cooked  The meat was wet and rubbery like they were steamed. I asked my vary nice waitress to speak to the manager A very polite and nice manager came over to my table and looked at the wings and knew right off the bat that they weren't cook properly. we were having a very polite conversation of how asked them to be  cooked when this crazy man comes from the back ( I guess he is the chef ) screaming in my face and I quote \" I cook them 3 minutes longer how am I supposed to know how you want them cooked \"  I know for fact the waitress told him 3 times how I wanted them cooked so I told manager to get him out of my face and to bing My check The manager was very polite and said she will take care of the check and she was very sorry So until they get a better cook I would avoid this place at all cost"}
{"text":"This is a small place but has the best wings in town. I've been there w coworkers and we've never had one complain. A big plus is the bar is there too and they also have multiple pool tables."}
{"text":"Wing King should add Pizza Queen it's court! And the Kingdom is forever made better because of it in my opinion!  I just had the best pizza experience and can't wait to try some of the specialties! The new place comes with new items! Get down here and try some of them yourself!"}
{"text":"Went in without knowing what to expect since I'm new to the city. Small counter inside a bar which seems sketchy, but the wings were great. Had lemon pepper mild and they were very tasty. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"By far the best wings and flavors. They are amazing and I get wing king cravings it's so good!! Owner is  amazing and homemade deserts!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Vegas. Definitely the best wings and some of the coolest  people working there. Tons of live music, what more can you ask for"}
{"text":"The pig wings are an interesting take on wings in general. I have tried several flavors on both the chicken and the pig wings and I have no complaints about either. I usually have to ask wing places to drop the wings twice to make them extra crispy, but I forgot to tell the person taking the orders over the phone. Luckily, these wings didn't need it. They were crispy, flavorful, and even though I had them delivered, they were scorching hot.   Great service from both the order taker and the delivery man.   The wings are pricey.  I wouldn't serve them to a large crowd."}
{"text":"Wings Bomb! Shanks Bomb! Sauces Bomb! Please your stomach eat here! Also you can get a drink from the bar and shoot some pool. They have it all here!"}
{"text":"We live in Henderson and drove all the way down to wing kings new location through hectic traffic to eat some wings, and I have to say I'd do it 100 times over, the chicken was prepared to perfection, my mouth was salivating at the sight of those big meaty looking wings. If I ever eat wings anywhere else I'm sure it would just remind me of wing kings amazing wings. Its surely going to be the only place I eat wings from now on."}
{"text":"First time here and I must say the service was exceptional, an awesome assortment of flavor for he wings--very creative too--and a very chill and relaxing environment. It even had a plug by my booth for my computer to get a little studying and work done."}
{"text":"From all the wing places in the city, this is the best. The price is pretty nice and the guy who runs this place is really cool. If you have any doubts about a flavor, he'll let you try the sauce beforehand. My personal favorite so far is the curry seasoned one.  Their desserts are nothing short of delicious. I'm a big fan of the red velvet cake and peach cobbler myself.   The atmosphere is more of a cafeteria, but the service and food match a sit 'n' dine. He plays some nice rock music at a balanced volume and it surprisingly makes you feel very comfortable while eating.  Overall, whether you need a light snack, or a full meal, it's definitely worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Did not even get to order food from here. The number on there website is wrong and the guy that answers is a complete douche! Found the right number and then they can not deliver....I don't get how they are in business."}
{"text":"Literally the best wings of all time! And oh my goodness the peach cobbler is phenomenal! 80 flavors of wings... Don't let the smokey atmosphere steer you away from some amazing wings"}
{"text":"Delicious,  quick and great prices... I like the boneless especially... they have a huge variety of flavors from mild... to oh my goodness on fire.  Try the apple bbq, awesome. Staff is friendly and service is great... you can eat there or togo.. but eat there, then you can order more..."}
{"text":"the best in all of vegas. when you get here, please allow atleast 15 mins to figure out what you want out of 80 flavors of sauce, i was so overwhelmed lol."}
{"text":"Great customer service!   We had placed an order of wings for delivery from Wing King, unfortunately they had forgot our drinks while they delivered the food. At time of calling and letting them know they instantly offered a free wing combo and dessert to makeup for the mistake. Overall this place has some of the best wings in Vegas, will definitely be a usual customer soon."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout and everything, wings, tenders and pizza were excellent. Ordered half medium and half garlic teriyaki. Both are delicious and I'll be less cautious on my next visit and work my way through the 80 flavors. Pepperoni pizza was nice and rustic and had a delicious chewy crust. They were setting up for some live music when I went to pick up and the restaurant has a great Reggae vibe to it. This place is a winner."}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING!!! Without a doubt best wings I've had in a long time. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because of the location definitely should be a stand alone business. The food has the potential for big things especially if they got closer to the strip with so much tourist in the area."}
{"text":"The Wing King in Vegas is the place to be!! Not only do they have amazing Wings, they have so many amazing flavor and they use the freshest ingredients.   Not only that, but the owner himself made sure that my vegetarian wife was served the most an amazing dish! Fresh veggies that were seasoned for a queen!   On top of all of that.. Damn best venue in Vegas to see a bad ass reggae show!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. 80 sauces on the menu with more unlisted. The pig wings are phenomenal!  Must get those when you visit here.  Meat falls off the bone.  So good. Best wing place in Vegas hands down."}
{"text":"My favorite place on earth! Yummm! Me and my boyfriend come all the timee and Brian and his staff are so sweet and funny. Great atmosphere and foood."}
{"text":"This is the beat place in vegas to come get you some good wings or pizza um telling you this the place to be"}
{"text":"Just had the best chicken & waffles!!! Wings well done with great flavor and a homemade waffle and buttermilk syrup to die for! Great atmosphere and friendly employees!! Will be added to my favorite place to eat in Vegas!!! Try the strawberry cheesecake wings...DELICIOUS!!! R. Taylor"}
{"text":"I finally checked this place out Wing King  The wings where just okay nothing to jump hurdles over .. The guy with the Dredlocks was very rude , bad attitude bad customer service  The red velvet cake was suck !! It was so dam dry not moist at all ..but the peach cobbler was great !  The folks at wezziannas  where more friendly  and there gumbo was the Bomb"}
{"text":"I came in and ordered Togo. We ordered 3 lbs of wings and fries for $50. To me that was kinda a lot for not so much food. The wings were ok.... the fries weren't good at all, thick and very seasoned. Would have been nice if the lady actually told us they were thick and seasoned and not plane . After we ordered to go, it took over 30 minuets, yes 30 minuets to cook wings. May have been the slowest kitchen ever and there only 1 table in the restaurant.  The girl should have warned us prior to ordering it would take that long. Absolutely ridiculous. I wasn't feeling the reggae , hippy vibe either but oh well."}
{"text":"These are BY FAR the best wings I've ever had. A lot of people talk about all the flavors they have, and that is great, but don't let that make you think they aren't all quality sauces. I haven't had a bad one yet. Best of all, they don't skimp out on the sauce like other places. Get some fries and use the extra sauce as a dip. Everyone who works here is extremely helpful and nice, letting you have a bit of a sauce you wanna try and giving you recommendations. It is obvious they care about the product both in how they act and the product itself. I've been going here for a couple of years now, and this is one of my favorite places in Vegas, though I haven't been able to make it as much now that it moved locations (better location in general, just farther from my house)."}
{"text":"Really good wings at this place.   With 80 flavors to choose from you will find something to eat.  They make the fries from scratch.   The fried pickles were great too.   It's located in a bar so kids can't exactly come with you.   The owner is very personable and looks out for his customers.   Would definitely go again and recommend anyone else who loves wings to go try it out."}
{"text":"I saw this place on yelp and saw the amazing reviews for being the best in Las Vegas so I knew this was a must try place as I walked in I went straight to wing king  to order my wings as it was inside a bar which it didn't bother me. So I continue to order my wings and ordered 3lbs of wings with a side of fries and a drink which I didn't know I had to go to the bar to get my drink all I wanted was a sprite as I asked the lady for a sprite she asks me for my I.d really my i.d which there was never no SIGN in front of the doors saying I needed my i.d!!! I was coming from out of town so I had left my I.d back in the hotel never did I think I needed my i.d to just go order me some wings to go! she immidietly tells me I need to leave and that I am not allowed to be in there  after I had payed for my food! So I try to wait for my order and she than tells me again I need to leave in front of all the customers so I walk out very embarrassed i couldn't believe this! I literally  had to wait for someone to walk by to ask them if they could bring my wings I had ordered and had payed for!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome wings...tried 3 different flavors Adrenaline, Hot and Garlic Parmesan.. Ordering 2 more pounds to go spicy BBQ and Spicy Garlic! Bomb!!!!;;!"}
{"text":"My friend kept telling me how awesome this place was, so i finally went. He wasnt kidding, probably some of the best wings ive ever had and the sauces are delicious. Thank god this place isnt closer to my house otherwise i would probably get it daily. Got the chicken wings and was not disappointed, the man at the counter also let us try the pork wings which were also amazing."}
{"text":"Lord have mercy! These are literally THE BEST wings in town! With that said let me tell you why. Starts out with a pit in my stomach craving for some delicious wings. We find this place on yelp and so my friend and I tried it. Here are the main points on why it was an awesome experience.  1. The wing size as compared to Wing Stop and Buffalo Wild Wings is a lot larger.  2. The price. A way better deal than any other wing place in town.   3. The service. The owner, Brian, is a down to earth and chill kinda guy. He really cares about his customers and their experience.  All in all Wing King has the whole package! Delicious food at a great price with great service!"}
{"text":"Wing king has the best wings I have ever had! The dry rub wings are amazing! The peach cobbler is a definite must!"}
{"text":"Absolute Loved their wings! I was visiting from Hawaii and i Loved their Service and wings. Food is Awesome and vibe is great, plus they have karaoke and its Awesome! I definitely plan on Visiting soon again !!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. the wings are unbelievable. the fries are probably the best fries i've ever had (and it's very hard to top McDonald's fries). highly recommend this place if you're a wings fan."}
{"text":"Best wings I've had since my previous favorite closed, and they deliver! Great wings, really good fries, and usually friendly service. Biggest downside is their being located in a bar, and their long delivery times. Today, I also discovered that they like to change their delivery charges based on whomever answers the phone, so be careful."}
{"text":"Didn't like that garlic cheese bread thing lol but then wings are heavenly . Recommended"}
{"text":"Omg!!!! Pig wings!!! I cant even eat normal wings anymore. This place is so good. Like 100 different sauces its beat to ask for whats \"good\" because the names of sauces alone are amazing! If you want really good wings and cool service check em out!!!!"}
{"text":"So good. Lemme tell you!!! Try pig wings! You will not like wild wings or really any other wing after. The wings chicken or pork (pig) are just so good. Cajon fries are a nice side. Britney and mama are so cool and helpful in picking type of wings since there is over 80 sauces. Garlic parm, and Jamaican jerk medium were both ammmmmazing!!!"}
{"text":"My husband found this place and we decided to go last night. We got 50pcs wings: hot, teriyaki, sweet chili slam, jamacian jerk bbq hot and spicy mango. The hot was a perfect hot not tearing your mouth off but a good kick, teriyaki was very good, sweet chili slam is the one that rrally caught me off gaurd and had to get milk, jamacian jerk bbq was smoky full of spicies and flavor lots of kick and the spicy mango was a great blend of sweet and spicy. Then we got a large fries they had a spicy cajun seasoning on it which i didnt realize until my 7 yr old grabbed one and yelled hot :-) ! But other then that they were very good and were fresh cut. I ordered the fried pickles and the guy there bryan waited until we got there to drop them so they would b nice and crisp still when we got home needless to say they didnt make it home lol they were awesome thin and crispy! They have an awesome zesty ranch dip and blue cheese dip as well!  We also had their red velvet cake it was old school made and awesome and the peach cobbler was amazing not overly sweet and my son loved their cookies! We will definatly be back again and telling our family and friends about this place!"}
{"text":"Wing King is the best wing place I have been too. I came here with a group and we ordered 8 flavors of wings at 1 lb per flavor (about 6-7 wings per pound). There are 80 flavors and the ones we chose did not disappoint. Garlic parmesan has great texture and the cheese actually stuck on the wings without the use of excess oil like other places. But the most insane and delicious flavor we got was Spicy Strawberry Cheesecake with the side of yogurt sauce.   To top it off, our waitress Brittany is one of the friendliest, down to earth, most badass woman ever.  Save room for the peach cobbler because it is super delicious.  We will be back again and then some."}
{"text":"Best wings in town. Peach cobbler is a must try. Over 100 flavors to chose from. Will be coming back to the best wings in town again!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Great wings and the peach cobbler is amazing!!! Great place to grub!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite wing place.....hands down!!! We ordered the Sampler which is chicken wings and \"pig wings\"....so many sauces to choose from!!!  The pig wings are like having bbq ribs except so much meatier...blueberry bbq sauce is absolutely delicious!!! I tried the Apple bbq today and its delicious as well.  Mango habanero sauce I ordered for my chicken wings and it's my favorite for now,,,, as I'm going to try others in the future.   The fries are seasoned fries and we ask for them lightly seasoned and they are perfect for us!!! We've eaten here several times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has AMAZING wings and fries!! Oh and of course Peach Cobbler!!  I have only been once and have gone back twice to eat BUT they are not open on Sunday?!?! It's football season and I want wings on Sunday!!!  Still they get 5 stars because the food is that good....but please open Sunday...even if its just long enough to take my order!!"}
{"text":"A foodie-friend recommended this spot for wings / burgers. Apparently they started in a a window in a bar and now are their own successful restaurant. I really enjoy these wings / fingers!  They have 100 flavors and every single one i've tried is nothing but incredible. you can add CBD for $3 more - no it's not weed, essentially it's a stress reliever with no mental/body high whatsoever and it's natural. we got one order with it and you can't taste the cbd at all.  The customer service is wonderful and the atmosphere is laid back. They play live reggae on the weekends."}
{"text":"My new go to wing place.  Flavor options are awesome.  They will have something to fit everyone's taste.  Wings are good sized, and crispy as you'd expect.  Pig wings are a most.  You have to get a order when you visit this place."}
{"text":"I really wasn't impressed... I had the garlic parm fries they were hardly warm & soft like they were old!!! And the boneless wings weren't bad, doubt I'd go back!!!"}
{"text":"We were disappointed in the service we received at Wing King. We felt like it took quite a while to get anything--including plates and silverware. Although some of the sauces were good, the mango barbecue wasn't. It just didn't seem like they had things figured out, which was surprising as they have been open for a while"}
{"text":"I have had a hankering for real buffalo wings for quite a while in Las Vegas and was unable to find anything that met my memories expectations until I found WING KING! This is it folks. Go get your WINGS HERE!  They have more than a dozen flavors with HELL being the hottest.  I went with my normal Buffalo wing choice and I was not disappointed in the least. They are exactly as I wanted, crispy, spicy and fresh.  I must say however that the space to eat them in is NOTHING to crow about, it is a weird convoluted space with several fast food joints all crowded into a big room with fast food table and chairs with florescent lighting. NOTHING to CROW about and NOT a DATE PLACE...However you can can call ahead and the owner, who is from Louisiana, will take your order and have it waiting for you to pick up.   This is the BEST CHOICE for Game day and he said he has orders for HUNDREDS of wings going out to people now...so CALL AHEAD!  Amazingly, the owner called us the next day to see how our wings were and to be sure he got the order right!!!! OMG he cares too! Lovely man.  I wish him the very best in his WING KING endeavors and hope he brings another WING KING to DOWNTOWN VEGAS soon..although the drive is fast from downtown- just straight up Charleston...  Now don't forget to leave room for the VERY BEST PEACH COBBLER ever. Did I mention that the owner is from Louisiana? This is his mothers recipe and she not only raised a fantastic business person but developed the BEST PEACH cobbler.  Kudos to doing a great job, making the best wings, having th best customer service and the BEST DESERTS!"}
{"text":"Decided to try after reading all the rave reviews. Not impressed. Great selection in sauces but the chicken fingers were blah and the wings were just ok. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Solid player in the wing kingdom.  Probably the best in LV.  The owner was very accommodating giving me 4 flavors to try for my order.  All food was hot & fresh.  Odd locale but I can overlook it for the food."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian... And I love this place. Mac n' Cheese, fried pickles and my favorite... PEACH COBBLER FROM HEAVEN!!! It is a hidden treasure."}
{"text":"Been meaning to post my review!!! The whole team is amazing and so courteous. Not to mention that their food is absolutely delicious make sure to hit up their lunch special it's the best deal. Thank you again Wing King for satisfying all my cravings"}
{"text":"Get the appetizer I don't know what it's called but it's breaded cauliflower fried like a hot wing. They are heaven in your mouth! The sauce choices can be a little overwhelming but just pick any barbecue and you will be happy."}
{"text":"My husband insisted on trying Wing King after reading reviews on yelp.  We live about a /2 mile away so it's convenient!  It's basically in a food court and doesn't have the best ambiance, but the wings and fries were amazing!  I had the Jamaica slam sauce and it was delicious and spicy. My husband had the garlic Parm and I loved them too!  The garlic pepper fries added an extra kick along with the dipping sauce.  To me the absolute highlight was the peach cobbler...delectable!!! We're definitely going back!!!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin....the server, Nora, is amazing and super friendly, going out of her way for you. Secondly, the food is magnificent! From the crispy fries and amazing wings to probably the best pizza I have ever had. And how could you forget all the sauces, that's like Batman forgetting his mask and cape! Also, if you're looking for a laid back and comfortable atmosphere not like a bdubs or your local section 8 wing stop then this is your place. Good job wing king, you deserve the crown in which you earned, I crown thee 6 out of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Best wings yet.  Awesome flavors and great staff.  Bonus:  Optional CBD oil with your choice of sauce."}
{"text":"Chicken wings is my all time favorite food so I'm very picky with it. I saw a lot of good reviews about wing king so I wanted to give them a shot. Walked in and the servers kids were running around and she kept yelling at them. Then the table was sticky and the people behind us said the same thing but they said it's the paint so idk I would say do a better job with that so people don't think you have dirty tables. Okay so the wings came out and oh lord the wings were sooo big and did not taste good at all me and my sister only had 1 or 2. Defiantly won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"As i entered the establishment i was greeted by an elderly white lady whom politely told me to hold. Upon her coming to the front counter she ask\" pick up or to go?!?!\" Well since i was handling business in the area and had time to spare was hoping to be able to dine in . Found that a little disturbing , still sat in enjoying my lunch special sweet hot garlic wings . Open up my bag/box to notice no ranch dressing???? Like wtf eats wings without the ranch.. she never tried to ask me for any condiments while taking my order . thankfully the younger black waitress assisted me with my request.  Being I've been enjoying they're wings since they were in a sports bar on east Sahara"}
{"text":"Can you get addicted to a food? I went today and they had Banana Walnut cake... If I could get addicted on something...it would be their food..."}
{"text":"BEST  hot wings ever, better than our homemade hot wings with lots of optional flavors and option to add CBD oil to our sauce  ... need to being it to Honolulu, Hawaii.  ALOHA !!!!"}
{"text":"Recommended to this place by Tien. Ordered the Sweet Chili wings. Good sized wings, and a good price. They were crisp and pretty tasty. I think for their sauce they used the Mae Ploy sweet chili sauce. The celery sticks were good. This is located in the same mini-mall as Manna Korean restaurant and Kaba Curry. Nice place to go for an affordable meal in an informal setting."}
{"text":"Move over WingStop, Buffalo Wild Wings, and all other competitors! These are the best wings I have ever had. Hands down. Having first heard of this place from a friend of mine, I knew I had to try it. 40 flavors of wings? Are you kidding me? That's insane! I've never had SO MANY to choose from. And being an extremely picky eater this was good news to me.  Walking into the internet cafe that this gem of a place is hidden away in, I was surprised. Having expected Wing King to have it's own building. But that is beside the point, don't let the fact that it's in a food court fool you. This place is phenomenal!  The owner, Brian, is one of the nicest guys I have ever met. He let us take our time with the menu, and even offered some suggestions. For my first time I went with a six-piece of \"Hot Chili Lime\" flavored wings, and an order of fried pickles. Oh, did I mention the fried pickles? They're perfect! (This place really had me at the fried pickles) ANYWAYS, the food was a very good price. Just about $4.50 for a six-piece order of wings (plus ranch and celery) and $1.49 for a basket of pickles. Being a college student who loves wings and is on a budget, I was estatic to see those prices.   Now, those wings. Hot Chili Lime is something I knew I would love, I was very right. Tangy and spicy, and just delicious. My mouth is watering just thinking about them!  Since my first time, I've been back several. And have had a different flavor of wings (almost) every time. Along with their french fries, jalapeno bombers, red velvet cake, peach cobbler, and cookies! With so much to choose from, you really can have it your way (sorry, burger king!) when you come to Wing King.  I'm a pretty regular customer here, and don't plan on ending that anytime soon.  So to sum it all up, this place is great! If you want great food, with great service, definitely stop by Wing King. (Did I mention it's great?)"}
{"text":"worlds best wings ever..  thank you so much brian peace for your awesome wings and fries.  yummy yummy yummy thank you"}
{"text":"This place certainly is the King of Wings. So many flavors to choose from, surpassing  places like wingstop and BWW. They make everything as soon you order it. With Wing King you wait what you pay for. If you're an impatient glutton this isnt the place for you. Location is a humble internet cafe which seems more like a cafeteria. Brian the owner is this really humble family man doing what he loves. He always makes sure to check up on you and see that you're satisfied. I would not say the same about his teenage employees who the past two times ive gone there seem to have trouble taking my order or working the register. Nonetheless the food and hospitality of the owner surpass expectations."}
{"text":"Not sure why all the mixed reviews. My experience was great! Our server Nora was amazing, the service she provided alone was enough for a second visit. She had a great friendly personality, gave good input on the food and makes you feel welcomed. She was attentive during the whole visit and even offered a drink to go. My mild sauce was a little more spicy than anticipated and she was more than happy to take it back and have them remade with the sauce on the side. Due to our wait on the food, she provided a discount. Which was a unexpected surprise. The food was full of flavor and you can tell it was all fresh and homemade. They have a wide variety of flavor for their wings so there is something for everyone. We tried the strips and wings and they were amazing. Their mozzarella sticks are the best I have ever had, these are no frozen pre packaged mozzarella sticks! If the owner is reading this, you need to give her a promotion and hire 10 more just like her!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE customer service!! I called to place a togo order and was put on hold for over 10 minutes so I hung up. When I tried calling back the line was busy. I was ready to give up, but my husband really wanted to try this place so he kept calling. The girl that finally answered had zero familiarity with the menu-I'm not sure if she was new or what, but she had to call us back twice about items that were not available togo or seasonings/sauces that could not be provided on the side. Was told the food would be ready in 20 minutes. I showed up 25 min after the second call thinking this would provide them with enough time. Was told it wasn't ready. Waited 20 more minutes before they realized my food had been sitting in the warmer the whole time. No apologies zero f's given. At least the chicken, ribs, and sauces were good despite being cold."}
{"text":"My favorite wing spot.. hands down best wings (with 100 different flavors) in Nevada!! Trisha's an amazing server with very friendly service. Highly recommend the fried peach cobbler!!"}
{"text":"Freaking amazing! The peach cobbler is THE BEST I've ever had. The wings are juicy and they are very generous with the sauce. Loved it. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The spicy honey BBQ chicken wings and garlic teriyaki pig wings sooooo delicious! Mmmmm!!! Tried so many though, money mustard chicken was good! The boysenberry cheesecake chicken was so good surprisingly too!! Mmmmm!!"}
{"text":"Meh says it all.  We had such high hopes for this place, especially after reading all the wonderful reviews on Yelp. First, I will say categorically that their wings are better than Buffalo Wild Wings.  But BWW sets the bar so low that saying that isn't really a big recommendation.    First, we were seated at a booth which seemed like it had the \"sticky' permanently embedded in the top of the table.  I'm not sure what they can use that will remove sticky residual sauce from the tabletops, but I've got to believe there is something industrial that will do the job.  We tried their \"pig wing\" starter with a bbq sauce selected by our server.  I couldn't tell if it was mesquite or hickory, but it was decent enough.  These \"pig wings\" are little fried riblets dipped in sauce.  Nothing spectacular.  We ordered 3 lbs of wings so we could sample sauces, and I guess we chose unwisely?  We tried Honey BBQ, Salt and Vinegar and Garlic Parmesan.    The Honey BBQ were fried wings with BBQ sauce poured over the top.  You could literally do the same thing yourself, fry up some wings and dump your favorite BBQ sauce over the top.  But I bet your favorite BBQ sauce tastes a LOT better than their Honey BBQ sauce does.  The Salt and Vinegar were tasteless.  My wife tried that one first, as she LOVES Salt and Vinegar wings, and these were the worst we've ever had.  She usually gets them at the Albertsons on Charleston and Desert Foothills, and they are WAY BETTER from Albertsons.  They have a strong salt and vinegar taste there, but these at Wing King were tasteless.  Like they forgot to add any flavoring at all when they were cooking the wings.  Finally- the Garlic Parmesan were decent.  Not exceptional, but good enough that if those were the only thing we ordered, we would return to try other flavors.  One last note- even the ranch and blue cheese dressing they charge you for isn't all that great.  Like from one of those old time salad bars where they mix their own dressing, but water it down to make it go farther.  Like that."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner. The place wasn't busy but did have a couple big groups eating. We ordered  food and it took about 45 minutes to get some of our order. They did comp the French fries but they tasted like cardboard. The wings were good. About another 30 minutes later my daughter finally got her pizza but we were so ready to leave that we got it boxed to go. The Food is ok but not worth the wait. I'd hate to come here when it was really busy. The waitress was nice though."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend. Decided to come in for a late dinner. I am a huge lover of wings, but they also have other items on their menu. Wing King is the definition of chillllll & laidback. The staff is so kind and communicating. They played awesome reggae/hawaiian music. We waited quite a while for our meal, which is why i knocked off a star. But the wings are phenomenal and i love their ranch. We ordered the Garlic Parmesan and Asian Fantasy which we were certainly pleased. They have 100 flavors to choose from! This place has so much variety!"}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for food. Ridiculous. Service is very slow. No sense of urgency. The wings were nothing special and the fries were soggy"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch last week, place was dead but picked up while we were there. The menu has a ton of combo possibilities and I was happy to have our server explain it throughly. They are fully embracing the Mary Jane/Bob Marley/reggae vibe and have live music at night. They have a lunch special for like 6 bucks that comes with a drink, fries and 5 wings but we wants to try more varieties. The wings were good. We went with a wet traditional hot, and a dry rub lemon pepper as well as a dry rub jerk pig wings. We were super excited to try those, basically a rib, ours a little dry. I'm not sure I'll be a regular because I have so many places to try in this city but it was good."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to come in.. ordered the reg and pork wings. Got lemon pepper and mango habanero. Wasn't crazy about either. The lemon pepper tasted like the seasoning you guy from the store and the mango was on the hot menu so I expected heat.. got none. However, I got the buffalo cauliflower and it was suuuuper good! Took a bit of my friends waffles and that syrup.. omg idk what it is but good lord!! It's amazing!!   Original review: My roommate ordered takeout and asked me to pick up on my way home. I checked the menu on my way there and saw two jalapeño dishes I was interested in ordering. One was close to jalapeño bottle caps and the other was stuffed jalapeños.. when I got there the woman told me they didn't have either dish so I was super disappointed. My roommate says the wings are amazing have yet to try."}
{"text":"I actually like this place, has a cannabis friendly/ Caribbean vibe. I ordered the chicken strips w/ spicy honey bbq and a pound of fries which my date and I shared. For whatever reason my date was offended that the server placed empty plates in the middle of the table forcing us to move our hands, but I'm not sure there was another way to avoid that, given the size of the table and the length of her reach.   Anyways, the strips were served on a super small plate so that the food hung off the edges, not sure why the choice in such small plates, but the strips were good and well seasoned and sauce was great. The fries were very good, I should've ordered some to go. The server did tell us that from time to time they do have live music, bands preform, which is very cool.   The only complaint I'd have is that the young female server should've been equally as friendly to my date as this can cause a negative ripple in the experience. Other than that she was very polite and helpful."}
{"text":"These wings are HUGE! These wings arent the same size you get at a WingStop or places like that. We ordered 3 pounds ( they sell by the pound) of 3 different flavors. We had Jamaican, Sweet Chili Jerk and Spicy Strawberry Shortcake! The strawberry one you dip it in yogurt and it is UNBELIEVABLE!! They have a huge 1st place trophy there that backs up their wings too.  This is our new favorite wing place!! My girl loves it and she is a wingologist!! Cool staff too, very helpful on the 80 flavors to choose from. Big ups Wing King!"}
{"text":"Spicy garlic parmesan wings are where it's at, bros and hos. I stopped by here after missing my work's Happy Hour on Friday afternoon, thinking I'd take HH home to the BF. I've been to a few other places in this food court and remembered this place- site indicates that they have 40 flavors of sauce, so I thought they'd be a good option.  In short, guys, I was blown away. Menu offers 6 wings for $5, so naturally I went hog wild and got three orders- for research purposes, you understand. Gotta make sure this review is thorough.  The spicy garlic parm were amazing. I love garlic, I love parm, and I love spice- but usually garlic parm wings are dry, bland, and/or underwhelming, but never spicy. Here, they actually ARE! And the excess cheese crumbles in the dish are delicious too. This was the favorite flavor by far.  Next up was spicy mesquite barbeque- I'm a Texas girl, and Mesquite BBQ is a Texas thing. This flavor took me back home, in a good way. Warm heat, got the spices right.   Jamaican Jerk Barbeque was recommended to me by the cashier as her favorite- and they were excellent. Extra saucy, warm heat and a lot of flavor. Not as good as the garlic parm, but still good- and an option you won't find too many places.  I'll def be going back to try more flavors, and perhaps buy stock in the spicy garlic parm. Menu also boasts \"pig wings\" which are actually mini hams? Doesn't sound appealing to me at all, but they're the only place in the state that offers them so that means I'll get around to trying them sooner or later.  Side note on the service; as a note says by the front counter, this is not a fast food place. Your order is made WHEN you order, so expect a wait. Mine took a reasonable 15 minutes, and I was pleased with the product. I prefer fresh food even if a wait is required though I understand some might be on a time crunch and assume the food-court location is going to be quick. Definitely recommend calling ahead to order, which they encourage! Service was provided by a couple with dreadlocks- super sweet and friendly, really felt as though my business was appreciated."}
{"text":"So happy to see that WK has found a new home! I was heartbroken after they left their old space, and really appreciate management reaching out to message old customers via the Yelp reviews to let us know about the new location.  The most important info: they have 80 flavors, but garlic parm is the best. They now offer chicken strips in addition to the chicken wings and pig wings (not always available), order by the pound. New location is a counter inside of a bar, must be 21 to enter- dine in or take out. Friendly service, food made to order, can call ahead to minimize wait time.  Though the garlic parm has my heart, I tried the Jamaican slam and really enjoyed that- the medium garlic was medium but had not even a hint of garlic? Found the wings to be smaller and less meaty than past location. The wings are sold by the pound but did not seem to be that weight. One pound order, per menu, is at least 7 pieces- my order had 8, each pound is $8, works out to $1/wing which is on par with most places in town.  Dropping my review down a star- don't know if it's an \"absence makes the heart grow fonder\" thing or what, but I just remember this place being better. It's now a bit out of the way for me, and I will keep them in mind when a wing craving hits but won't be going out of my way to get out here regularly."}
{"text":"Best wings in vegas,and awesome service from trish!always great food and service!a must try if u have not already!"}
{"text":"Came to this place because one of my husbands friends suggested it instead of BWW. He showed me a menu on yelp and I was in due to the many sauce flavors. When we got there, such a good chill vibe. Looking through the menu, I was just in awe. Didn't know they sold by the pound but still def worth the price. If you're not trying to spend or on a budget, I don't suggest it money Wise but flavor wise I'm all for it. We ordered  s sampler, chicken strips , fries, pizza. OMG it was bomb! One hell of a place I will be coming too and sending my friends as well !"}
{"text":"Best wing spot in Vegas!!! This is my second time here and I'll continue to come!! LOVE IT"}
{"text":"These were the the best wings I've ever had!!!!  These guys are for real.  I've had wings everywhere throughout the United States and these are the best I've ever had.  We had 18 wings (Jamaican Sweet Chile and Jamaican Jerk Hot), pickle chips, and 2 different orders of fries (Sweet Chili and Cajun) and I could have eaten more.  I cant wait to try all they're other sauces as well.  I suspect you might be seeing these guys on Man vs. Food or Divers Drive in and Dives soon -- its really that good.  They should definately consider bottling they're awesome, original, and homemade sauces.  The owners and operators are super cool and will take good care of you!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Haven't tried the food yet but the service has been superb. Get your fill on wings then drink some alcohol and play pool. Couldn't ask for more in a location."}
{"text":"100 choices!!! So many wings, so little time! Cool Reggae atmosphere, friendly staff, delicious wings! Eat in or take out. Award winning recipes, voted best wings, if you like wings, guaranteed you'll love Wing King."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!  Just finished our delivery order of 28 wings & fries plus an AWESOME peach cobbler that they threw in for free!  The girls were super-nice on the phone and when the adorable girl showed up to deliver our order. The delivery fee is $3 plus the one-way mileage from them to you. We will definitely be ordering again. Thanks Wing King!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Second time driving here all the way from LA and these are BY FAR the best wings I have had when traveling in South-West US. Go for the Lemon Pepper Dry Rub and make sure to try the Hot Jamaican Jerk as well. There is definitely something for every winglover as Wing King has approx. 80 different flavors!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, but it just took a long time to come out and a long time to get the check and a while to get the ranch after we got the wings. If I wasn't starving and with a 2 year old, I wouldn't have cared to wait because the food was that good. But it was a hard visit because of that. The food really was amazing though. Honey BBQ wings were bomb. Fries were bomb. It was a lot more expensive than we thought. 2 drinks, 3 lbs of wings, and small fries was $50 after tip. But still 5 stars for food. Only star missing was for the waiting even though the restaurant wasn't busy at all."}
{"text":"Ok so you if you dont know i'm biased toward Wing King because i believe excellence should be rewarded and not ignored. The NEW Campus Commons is possibly THE best kept secret in the general area due to it's impressive gathering of several individual eateries with their own unique flavors as well as a community vibe.   Yes i know Brian the owner. The other guy behind the counter is Brandon his brother that holds down the shop when Brian is out doing other stuff. I've eaten here a few times and i've passed them up a few times and i'd like to share why i keep on coming back.  The Flavors Now if you think there's 40 flavors as advertised you're wrong. The count i'd estimate now would be around 60 flavors with a lot more in the works. A unique thing about Brian is the gears inside his head are always turning and cranking out new flavors. The latest set of flavors (new during this re-review) all contain contain the word 'Slam' in them because he 'Slammed' them together that afternoon. So far my all time favorite flavor are any of the Jamacian Jerk flavors. Standard is quite balanced with a layer upon layer of different flavors starting from some sweetness then some tangy savory, then herbal, then aromatics, and finally a steady rising heat from spicy.  The Apple Jerk is a bit sweeter but the latest being the Jamacian Slam is my new favorite with it's cinnamon notes  The Option to Taste and Pick What You Want Lets say you're torn between a few flavors or want to give a taste of what new. Ask Brian or Brandon to try out the sauce. Time after time they've shown remarkable patience and a willingness to grab the sauce bottles and give you a taste as well as explain to you the origins of the sauce and it's various other similar flavors or new flavors that have emerged from that once sauce.  Tweek the Flavor Lets say you choose a flavor but it's a bit spicier then you expected. This happens to me on a few occasions. I dont handle spicy all too well so i asked to cut the spicy by a third. They did it and it came out perfect. It's too spicy for you or not spicy enough? Ask them to crank it up or tweek it down. All sauces are made in house so they'd be more then willing to accommode you.   The Fries To be honest i love the regular fries. It's a mixture of the Seasoned dry rub flavor and a bit of the Cajun dry rub flavor but to me it's perfect for fries. Their fries dont come out of a plastic bag that's been frozen for a while. You are eating real washed skin on potatos and you can tell they are too, no two fries are the same and they all taste good. A new option is available to season your fries in different flavors as well. Garlic Parm is a huge hit among the masses as well as Sweet Chili. Be warned as these are better dine in then to go as the fries get soggy if you dont eat them fast enough.  There's Always Room for Dessert Desserts are also all home made and made in house. The usual lineup of desserts include a Red Velvet cake, their Too Much Chocolate cake, chocolate cookies, and everyone's favorite: the Peach Cobbler. If you're lucky there will be something different. I struck gold on two occasions when there was a soaked Rum cake available one day and a few weeks later a German Chocolate cake with the coconut cream center.  Bottom line. If you're hungry and in the mood for a whole lot of flavors that wont leave you broke till next week. Wing King is the place to check out. If you're on a diet and dont think you should be eating wings or desserts, come anyway. Pretty sure Brian can season a basket of celery sticks for ya."}
{"text":"If you want to wait an hour for your food, then wait longer for them to bring you your utensils, then find out the food is so salty and/or sour you can't eat it, then you'll probably like this place. If you love warm beer yet ridiculously cold interiors, then you'll have a good time.   Horrible experience at Wing Dingaling Kings. Told the waiter the food was too salty to eat, and he said it was supposed to be like that.   $50 for two adults and one kid? Save your money and go to Hooters."}
{"text":"Best wings and pig wings on the planet! Hands down. Brian is no doubt the \"Wing King!\" Do yourself a favor and get over here and try his creations. Trust me."}
{"text":"I could only give them 5 stars for the food. A little bit expensive but they offer you 100 flavors. I tried over 10 and my favorite is Apple Bbq. I wish they could give carrot on the side but apart from that everything is perfect."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews. With that being said, I was compelled just based on solely the awesome service (without mention the unbelievable wings and Pig Wings, my personal favorite and highly recommended!!!) Brittany was top notch running the whole op by herself. Unbelievable experience. I'm currently on  vacation but I will DEFINITELY BE COMING BACK for my work week next week."}
{"text":"This wing spot is tucked away inside a sports bar. It's dark, dive-y, and a bit of a questionable neighborhood. The menu, of course, is all about the wings. You can order chicken wings or pig wings by the lb. One flavor per a lb. There's also some combos, chicken and waffles, pizzas, sides, etc. We opted for 2 lbs. so we could try multiple flavors. We ordered half spicy strawberry cheesecake and half cajun hot. We also got a side of potato salad.  The Wing King server/runner was very nice and brought us our food, utensils, extra plate, etc. The wings were large and meaty. Big points for that. They also had a nice crisp. More points. And they weren't stingy with the sauce. More points. The ranch dipping sauce was nice. The blue cheese dipping lacked flavor and was too runny. The yogurt dipping sauce was super bland and boring. I wasn't a fan of the spicy strawberry cheesecake flavor. The spicy is cinnamon. I was hoping for habanero or something. It was just too sweet and dessert like for me. I don't want my chicken tasting like a cinnamon roll with a hint of strawberry. The cajun hot flavor was great. It tasted similar to Wing Stop's cajun. It was good mix of cajun flavoring and heat. The potato salad was incredibly bland and could've used any kind of something (pepper, mustard, something).  Things I wish they did... List the sauces in order of spiciness/heat. It was quite difficult to determine which hot sauce was the hottest. #1 as hot, hell was like #5. So is hot hotter than hell? I don't think so. Some ranking of the sauces would ease ordering for newbies. And as there are 80 sauce options, picking just 1 or 2 flavors is already a challenge. I also wish you could get 2 flavors per 1 lb. so you could experience more flavors.  All in all, great quality wings, cooked perfectly. And it's great to have so many flavor options. This spot is way far away from us, so not sure how often we'll make it back. But I want to come back and try some other flavors."}
{"text":"My husband and I discovered this gem a few years ago and make it a point to come here for a to go order multiple times a week. The wings are soooooo good! I've never been disappointed with any flavor I've tried. Fries are bomb as is the peach cobbler! Customer service is also fantastic! Best wings in Vegas for sure."}
{"text":"I came here because of the great reviews however I didn't have the same experience or thoughts.....  Had a pound of what our waiter called the hottest that they had, Suicide wings, they weren't hot at all. The dry garlic parmesan was eh. The worst absolute worst was the chicken itself! It was freakin dry as bone, the meat wasn't moist at all - it was over fried :/  Because it's inside shooters you have to order your drinks at the bar - a bit odd, I mean the waiter could have put in the order for us and charged us when he came back - that would've gotten a point for customer service. It was also smokey even though you couldn't smoke in the Wing King area obviously the ventilation system was non existent as the smoke from the bar came over.  Their one and only dessert? Peach cobbler wasn't a cobbler it was more of a peach compote. Can't call a cobbler a cobbler if there's no dough. Instead it's crust was all sugar it was too sweet and the unexpected crunch of the sugar crust didn't help.  Plus the one thing I found funny was that they offered a two for one on the cobbler if you gave them a five star rating on Yelp ..... I probably would have gone for it if I hadn't forgot to bring my phone with me so I didn't have to share dessert but glad I didn't anyways since it wasn't as good as I had hoped.   Disappointed.....won't return sorry to say."}
{"text":"Some friends and I went there yesterday for the first time, and it was delicious!!! We ordered 3 lbs of wings, feed 3 people with some to bring home. Wings were a large size, very meaty and fried jus right. Nice crispy skin but not dried out from over frying. Ordered lemon pepper , Jamaican slam, and mesquite BBQ. The young lady helped us pick two flavors due to so many different flavors. Might I add she had trustworthy taste buds!! She definitely was spunky and very informative on the flavors. We will be back this weekend !! Wing king has gained another faithful customer!!"}
{"text":"Great wings, tons of sauce combinations great service. These wings are whats up. Puts wingstop to shame."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time the other night after found out this place on Yelp. Glad my friend lives nearby or I would never know about this place!!   I really like the decoration  inside the restaurant, a few Bob Marley pictures give you some reggae vibe. Heard they have DJ playing music once in awhile. I came in the wrong night!! Bummer.   I ordered 3lbs of chicken tender with Jamaican Jerry, Lemond Pepper and spicy garlic flavor. Can't believe they really have 100 flavors!!! Their waitresses are really cool, they are easy to talk and definitely know their stuff about the everything on the menu. One of them actually working her way thru Nursing School!!!   Their chicken tenders were really good, although some of them were a little too hot for me to handle, so I guess I will just stick with something mild next time, my all time favorite is Lemon Pepper. I actually had to take some home cuz I couldn't finish all 3lbs!!   I will definitely be back to try their wings next time when I m in town."}
{"text":"I ordered for takeout. Totally impressed. I'm picky with my wings. I really enjoyed their lemon pepper wings."}
{"text":"My go-to wing stop on this side of town! I don't know why there are so many place that cannot fry up a great basket of wings. Maybe it is because I lived in the midwest for a number of years.  I could find great wings just about anywhere back there. I took it for granted.  Now I and very skeptical ordeeing wings because I have been let down numerous times.  Not here! These guys (and gals) know whats up! Even if they are a little out of you way...hit them up! You will not be disappointed.  Their wings are amazing! Nuff said!"}
{"text":"I'm always looking forward to find good wings. Chicken always.....Well I found wing heaven. Any favor you can think of they have it here.  I just wanted a wing favor I never had because all I eat is foul and fish, so chicken becomes boring but not here. I had to get three favors my first order. Each one had its own favor Honey habenaro,spicy garlic teriyaki and sweet chili jerk .  Similar favors but different. I highly recommend try it you will like it."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! We had the pig wings, which were tender and juicy. The chicken strips were huge, and delectable. You have to try the sweet potato waffle fries,or your meal will be incomplete. The ambiance is unique, which I love because you don't feel you're in Vegas. Our server, Donna, was extremely knowledgeable about the extensive menu, which made our visit a delight. Brian, the Chef/Owner knows what he's doing, so we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went there on a Tuesday night with a few friends. We got the fried pickles, they were crispy but a little too salty for me. The fried corn on the cob was small, half a cob, and really didn't care about it at all. The pig wings and the chicken wings were actually really good except from the 100 flavors on the menu (literally!) we didn't pick even one that we loved. We got the Szechuan for the pug wings and it tasted pretty much like barbecue sauce. Got some spicy sauce for the chicken wings and it tasted like Tabasco, kinda sour. The service was excellent, even though it seemed to me it took a little while to finally get the food.  I'm taking my family and coming back since I liked the both wings, hopefully we make better choices with the flavors."}
{"text":"This is by far my new favorite wing spot in town! The first time I came here the food and the service was so good, I thought, 'Maybe it's just a fluke? It can't be this good.' Well, 'lo and behold, on my second visit, everything was just as amazing!   Nothing here is a fluke. The menu is varied and well thought out. On our first visit, we tried the Fyah Buds and some Chipotle Medium and Medium Jamaican Jerk wings. The Fyah Buds are little nuggets of pure joy! Cauliflower is breaded in a flavorful and light breading, deep fried, and served with an amazing Green Chile Ranch dip that they should bottle and sell. The wings were hot and fresh with just the right amount of kick and spice. One of the unique things about eating here is that you can add CBD [Cannabidiol] oil to any wing sauce or dip sauce! Yes, actual CBD oil! So you can eat great food and ease your pain all at the same time! Gotta love Las Vegas!   On our second trip I had the Bomb Diggity Brown Sugar Bacon Burger and OMG...wow.  After taking one bite, I had to pause and enjoy all of the flavors that were dancing on my tongue! The burger was juicy, and the toppings and sauces blended together so well that I didn't need to add any condiments to it.   They have over 100 flavors of wings to choose from, so needless to say, we'll be coming back again and again. On some nights they even have live music for you to enjoy. All in all a wonderful place to eat with a unique menu, good prices, and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"Wing king kills the chicken wing game, Bomb.com In all honesty they have great customer service their is always someone checking up on your table. Food to dessert, Asian fantasy is fiyaaaaahhh! Even more exceptional on pork wings. And that peach cobbler... game changer. Theirs even vegan/vegetarian options. Do NOT forget the EXTRA EXTRA LOVE  #CBD infused"}
{"text":"O.K folks, I have done wing challenge after wing challenge. I cruise through Wing Stops Atomic Wings, Sprint right past Buffalo Wild Wings challenge and the hottest I have tried we're Hotlanta in Corona California suicide wing. I have met my match. Wing Kings Hell wings live up to the name. One bite and I was out man. Deceptive too because they don't smell hot but when it hits your lips be prepared for Hades himself to introduce you to your level of courage which in my case was defined by my laughing wife who just couldn't tell me enough times, well now you know what I feel like when you let me try your rediculous spicy food. Best wings ever. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"The Wings are Bomb.com! A lot of favors!  Great service!  Very chill spot! Staff is friendly!"}
{"text":"So bomb!!!! Got the 2 lbs. which comes with 2 flavors, I got the regular hot sauce and also Garlic parmesan dry rub. Kind of disappointed that I had to pay an extra 2 bucks for 2 things of ranch. I'm already payin 18 bucks for the chicken, at least throw in ranch for free... But anyway, that's fine I guess. Probably the best chicken wings I've eaten in a while! And I've eaten a ton of wings from different spots. I love WingStop, but I think Wing King even overtakes them! Will be going here again for sure! Did take about 30 minutes from walking in the door to getting them in my hands, so be prepared to wait. It was worth it though. None of that frozen crap."}
{"text":"The fake five star reviews, including one from the owner (did he really submit a one star review for Wingstop, too?) are a definite red flag, and the \"King\" unfortunately doesn't live up to the hype. He seems to have claimed his paper crown from that other false royalty of fast food, the Burger King.  The advertisement looked promising, and the menu even included two of my favorite comfort foods: mac and cheese and fried pickles. My husband was excited to try the garlic parmesan wings, and split his order with ranch-flavored wings to try something different. The wings looked frozen (unthawed) as they hit the deep fryer. The flavors were not easy to distinguish and my husband was unimpressed. The ranch dressing for dipping was straight from a bottle and also lacked quality. As for the food I tried, the macaroni was overcooked and disintegrating into the cheese mixture, into which the cook may have accidentally dropped the pepper shaker.  This dish could better be described as shredded pasta in creamy black pepper sauce. The fried pickle chips had a nice flavor and the serving was generous, but the large pool of oil inside the basket was unappetizing. Drain that grease. I also tried a few of my husband's french fries, which were handcut, but appeared to have been fried only once (twice is nice), as the crisp exterior revealed a dry interior.  The search for the best garlic parm wings continues, and I've told my husband that the Chicken Shack on the east side of town looks promising!"}
{"text":"Wings were good overall (not amazing, but good), but the cashier put in the wrong order for one of us and got:  an attitude when we brought it to his attention. He sighed all loud, said \"okaayyyyyy\", turned around and left after arguing with us about what we ordered. A few minutes later he brought the right order but we were leary of eating it. My husband loved the fries, I thought they had too much seasoning. They are located inside a bar, and it was VERY smoky. We asked for two waters with our order and he never brought them.   Overall experience was okay. We went to the bar to get water and the bartender was very nice. We won't be going back due to horrible customer service from Wing King."}
{"text":"I felt the need too tell anyone or everyone if looking too get dessert for potluck or party Wing King is Da Bomb. The only catch is need too give Brain 24 hour heads up. I looking too pick up desserts for going away party.  One that deserts truly taste homemade and da bomb. Sure they are dozen or bunch of bakery all across the valley too choose from but Wing King desserts truly dessert that tell Brian puts all heart and soul into it. I have tried Peach Cobbler, Banana Bread, and Red Velvet Cake miss couple but all da bomb. Really for a restaurant that pride itself on wings desserts here are the icing on the cake or treat straight out of no where. I talked too Brain the day before plus got myself dinner that night some honey habanero wings by far my favorite sauce. The garlic fries huge fan of too!! They just added piglet or forgot the description but riblet that more like popsicles. He offer me too try one it was in sweet chili sauce. If I knew about it would have ordered that instead. It not on the menu so would have too ask for it?? Brain was helpful deciding on two different styles of Red Velvet Cake but finding right fit for amount of people. He had it done on time requested. The way pack it! Truly bakery without the fancy logo on the box. It sturdy box one that place it in refrigerator before bring it out. It was amazing Red Velvet Cake. It MOIST the entire cake, nice dense not too light, and the frosting on top was divine. If you need ANY king of dessert Wing King is the place too go plus small business that love too support in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is my favorite wing place I have ever tasted I love it amazing staff and great atmosphere and of course amazing food"}
{"text":"First time here and absolutely LOVED IT!!! we will definitely be back with friends.  Atmosphere is great...love the reggae music! Wings were amazing!! You also have the option of CBD infused sauces or CBD water."}
{"text":"Just found this place and I will be back.  The green goblin pizza was very good and I'm looking forward to trying more.  I had the chili lime hot wings, though they were very flavorful, they weren't hot nor medium- more like mild.  I will be back to try more flavors!"}
{"text":"First time here, ordered food togo. Craving for something new around the area. I ordered the 2lbs sampler (half traditional wings & half pig wings), side order of onion rings & sweet potato waffle fries. The waitress was sweet and helpful when I placed my order over the phone, it was really loud so I could barely hear her. When I arrived, the placed was packed. They had live music & giving away prizes. Turns out they were doing a fundraiser to help raise money for a friend of theirs that past away (RIP). The chicken wings and pig wings were juicy and flavorful. Never had pig wings before so that's something new (it's ribs, shaped like a chicken wing). The sweet potato waffle fries were way over seasoned (next time I'll order them plain, if that's an option). I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been visiting Wing King on a weekly basis for about 2 years since they were inside Shooters Bar (Nellis and Sahara) and have since followed them to their new location on Fort Apache and Flamingo. We live on the far east-side so it's definitely quite a drive for us, but we do it often with a smile. Once we heard they were relocating to their own stand-alone place on the west-side, we were sad but also ecstatic to hear that they would no longer be under the thumb of yet another bar. This place has deserved their own location for a very long time and it was definitely overdue. Their location is absolutely gorgeous and very unique, but at the same time, totally represents who they are and their belief system. This is a great place to walk in after you've smoked a blunt or two in preparation for a very comforting and extremely delicious meal. It is VERY easy to spend about $50-$60 dollars in here for two people because everything on the menu catches your eyes and tempts you to go on a whim and try it...and whatever you order, NEVER disappoints. This is also the type of hole-in-the-wall place that the incredible general manager Brittany and even the innovative owner Brian Peace will personally deliver your meal to your table and will ALWAYS remember a familiar face.  The 100 royal sauce flavors are creative, one-of-a-kind, and absolutely amazing. And for marijuana enthusiasts, each flavor can be fused with CBD for only $3 extra per pound of chicken and or pig wings. Granted, we haven't tried every flavor just yet, but we try to mix it up every time, and each different flavor we've ordered has always been a pleasant surprise. Everything from their fried pickles and traditional wings, all the way to their peach cobbler and chicken and waffles, are to die for! We wish nothing but the best for Wing King and their new stand-alone location. We hope to enjoy their food for many many years to come...thank you for making amazing food!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place and I'm so glad she did!!!!  The food was phenomenal, I can't say enough of how perfect it was.  The wings were crispy, the piggies were cooked perfectly, the waffle fries were amazing and the fried peach cobbler was delicious.  We were our waiter Alex's first customer and he was great!!!  We also met the owner who was happy to stop what he was doing to talk to us. The atmosphere is so chill, very clean, and just all around pleasant.  It's our new favorite for sure.  Just wish they'd open another one in the NW so it's closer to us!!!"}
{"text":"Best wings I've had the pleasure of eating, I remember trying the brown sugar bourbon back when Brian was located at the indoor food court near CSN. His cobbler was pretty decent as well. Then it was gone.  Glad to see he is still grinding. I will be paying y'all a visit real soon."}
{"text":"We got Medium,honey garlic and garlic pepper bbq flavors ..The BEST chicken strips I've ever had and we also got the stuffed mushroom which was really good as well! The interior is really cool and the service was good too ! If you want good chicken wings and chicken strips come here !!! I highly recommend it. We for sure will be coming back !!!"}
{"text":"seriously people. stop going to other wing joints. this is probably one of the best places in town and the best prices in town and the best flavors in town and the best gat damn deserts in town. of course its all subjective but i havent met one person that has been here not say one bad thing. the other wing joints charge a lot more and the attention to detail isnt there. you wanna support local businesses? come and support this one! plus the food is awesome and so is brian. ask him to sing some sublime for you. yes i heard you singing while you were cooking brian... haha"}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to trying this place out since I love wings and my wife doesn't. She was out of town this weekend so I gave it a shot. I ordered 3lbs of chicken wings to go a small order of fries. Everything was very good. I really like Wing Stop but there isn't one very close by and I hate Buffalo Wild Wings so Wing King looked like a great option.  I ordered 3 flavors; Regular Hot was good, just as any normal hot flavor although I feel there wasn't quite as much sauce as I like. 2nd was Honey BBQ which was really good and had plenty of sauce. It tasted exactly like Wing stops BBQ. The last flavor I tried was supposed to be Mango Habanero. I am skeptical that it was actually the mango Habanero because it had zero spice. They actually weren't sure they had it when I called to order but the lady on the phone said it was available. It may have been mixed up with a different mango sauce but was still very good. All the wings had a good amount of meat so I didn't feel cheated. For 3 lbs I think I counted out 21 or so wings. For $27 that's kinda pushing it. More than a dollar a wing to me is overly pricy which is why I give 4 stars.  The fries were very good and the fry sauce is definitely good. The only real complaint I have about this place was that you get zero Ranch or blue cheese dressing with any wings. Its all extra. I've never seen a wing restaurant that doesn't give you sauce with the wings, especially at the prices they charge.  I would recommend it for sure, I'll probably try dining in because it seemed like a nice interior."}
{"text":"I give this place 10 stars. Wayyy better than any other wings in Vegas. I go here at least once a week since they've opened and i've never had a bad experience. My favorite is the spicy teriyaki but ive tried spicy garlic parmesan and a few other flavors and loved them all not to mention the fries are toooo yummy...Their day all special is perfect. The wings are meaty and very flavorful sauces. Besides the wings the customer service is great, they cater to every customer and Brian and his staff are awesome. I love this place :)"}
{"text":"Great customer service! Amazing food and atmosphere. The hostess (Cindy) was so sweet and informative not only about the wing options but everything the establishment offers e.g.  \"Love\", reggae concerts and a complimentary treat with your order at check in. I'll definitely be a regular here"}
{"text":"Definitely a hole in the wall so glad i decided to try this place out . They have some of the Best Honey bbq tenders  I've ever tried . On a mission to try all 80 flavors !  they also don't make the fries till you get there so they' won't get soggy which is pretty cool.  You get them hot & fresh . Will definitely keep coming back . It's a must try place for any wing lover!"}
{"text":"Roger T--I tried this place because of your glowing review.  I must have gone on a bad day because my experience was nothing close to yours.   Let's start with the positive news. The Sweet Chili Jerk sauce I chose for my boneless wings was amazing (better than anything I have tried at Buffalo Wild Wings).  They were sweet yet had a nice kick of spice to them.  If I were to rank this place on the wings alone, it would be 5 stars.   However, we did try some mediocre side dishes that really let me down.  First, the fries were overcooked and over seasoned.  The second offender was the macaroni & cheese, which was basically Kraft mac n cheese with some garlic salt and a ton of black pepper added to it.  The potato salad was a disaster, and really lacked any real flavor. Add in a stale Hawaiian roll, and our lunch was complete.   Let's talk about the service for a minute (or lack thereof).  I placed my order at 12:09 pm, and did not receive my lunch until 12:50 pm.  What's funny is that the place wasn't busy. There were 2 ladies in front of us-thats it! The entire food court was empty, so it was easy to count them.  In fact there were more gnats in the building than there were customers.  Since the doors were open, these creatures decided to have lunch with us.  The gentleman with the pony tail behind the counter was not friendly in the slightest.  All he could do was begrudgingly take my order and complain that he was short staffed for the day. However, to his credit- he did give us a few extra cookies to go - since we had to wait so long.   I am glad I tried this place. I would have never know that this hidden food court existed. If I do decide to come back for the wings (only), I will make sure to call my order in ahead of time. I would also recommend wearing a citronella bracelet if you decide to eat there.   5 star wings  Minus 1 for their side dishes  Minus 1 for the service"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! The vibe is cool and relaxed with the likes of Bob Marley and Rebelution on the radio..... Have I mentioned THE FOOD IS AMAZING!!!! Burger was cooked to perfection, fries fresh cut, and the chicken wings were out of this world! The sauces have such vibrant flavors, combine that with the amount of time the chicken is cooked and you have a home run on your hands! I simply cannot wait to order from this place again!"}
{"text":"If you like spicy burning tasteful wings this is not the place. I tried their suicide and x-hot and they both lacked hotness.. they do have a hell challenge but you can only have the flavor in house so I didn't try it since I ordered to go."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best wing place I have ever been to. The wings  are meaty and the pork is really good too. I have found my new wing place. I hope that they stay with the same quality and don't change anything like some places do. As long as they stay as great as they are now I will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Yummy the food is great I had traditional winngs in Jamaican jerk hot and the strips in lemon pepper medium and a small order of fries it was excellent. The order of strips is Hugh! Alex was very kind. Can't wait to visit so my gf can enjoy the sports and I can enjoy the reggae."}
{"text":"This is a vegan review!   The collie-buds were clever but definitely have to be breaded. We pretty much paid $18 for plain cauliflower in sauce. Most expensive cauliflower ever lol the sauces were tasty but when you want \"wings\" I need my cauliflower to resemble wings to some aspect.   The French fries were absolutely delicious! We finished the whole plate for sure!   They have a p-dubb(?) pizza that was fantastic! They put some of their new vegan cheese on it and we loved that as well!   Overall for a $60 meal it fell a little short and would only go back if they changed their collie bud recipe."}
{"text":"Wing King wings are ok but about 25% over priced. The interior is a little cheap and very Uncomfortable design for you to eat and leave. I ate there once I have no desire to go back."}
{"text":"The sign at the door says it all. This is not fast food. The fried pickles are the best I've had in a long time. Stacked high while crisp and not greasy. 100+ sauces and great service. Place has a homey feeling looks to be run by a family. Few tv to watch sports. Music is great. Drink is always full and service with a smile."}
{"text":"Very good wings, love the options of flavors.  Buffalo Wild wings overrated. Coming here for my wings now. Yummy."}
{"text":"YUMMM! I ordered the wings (hot) and they were perfect. They didn't have too much sauce or too little. They had a little kick to them which was perfect for what I wanted.   I got the Mozzarella sticks and they were amazing with their ranch! It was a little cold because they delivered and it was kind of far. (Which I think is awesome that they deliver further than just a few mile radius!)  The delivery driver ended up being the owner and he was very very sweet and polite. And he was very easy on the eye which is always a plus with your delivery man! Hehehe  Needless to say, I will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely wonderful. The service was absolutely wonderful. l was in the mood to not have soda so l went with pink lemonade, they were out so l took water and there as something in the water...eek. So l drank nothing. However, l loved the burger and loved the fries. Better than most places so l would come back...and have a soda."}
{"text":"The wings here are delicious!!!! So very impressed! They were at the Adrenaline bar when I tried it, and they moved.  If anyone knows where they went, please tell me!!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance, food was great -- cant go wrong with any of their wings. Awesome service also from Candice. Thanks for a nice lunch in Vegas"}
{"text":"My family had a pleasant time here. Our host Cindy happened to be taking care of something outside while we were walking in. She greeted and acknowledged us right away. She was really accommodating and made sure we were happy and had everything we needed. The head chef Daniel also came out to serve one of the dishes and apologized for a small miscommunication for one of our orders. It wasn't a huge deal to us but the fact that he came out of the kitchen to personally say hello really meant a lot. Canice was our amazing server who greeted us with smile as soon as we walked in. She was extremely sweet, friendly, really down to earth, and just awesome to have during our time there. She is really one of the greatest servers we've had going anywhere in a while. The atmosphere was a cozy, casual feel and the reggae music was great. We enjoyed our food and happened to love the mac n cheese bites (forgot the name of it on menu) and the garlic pepper dry rub wings the best. We will be coming back here and bringing other family members in, for sure. Thank you Cindy, Daniel, and Canice for a wonderful first time there. We appreciated each of you so much."}
{"text":"The owner is super sweet and hard working. The wings are delicious! Fast delivery and isn't too expensive for how much food you get"}
{"text":"Best wings in Vegas!!!! I got the chipotle mild. A few of my friends had other flavors and they were all outstanding!! The server was spunky and full of life. Very helpful and on time. I think her name was Sylvia. Fries are freshly made and hand cut! My favorite was the vibe of the whole restaurant! Tvs to catch the games, good music, and just a great feel. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Italian cheese fries... what I was expecting wasn't what I got. It's basically 2lb of fries with string cheese around it... what I was expecting was cheese on top like a pizza so I could at least get a good amount of cheese w/ my fries but instead I just got bits and pieces cheese here and there. Also the fries were soggy and dry which is fine for some people but it wasn't for me. For $10.99 I was expecting better. Also got the wings which were alright but I don't see myself driving to get some. 3 stars. Wasn't bad but wasn't anything I'd crave for."}
{"text":"What have I been doing with my life?  I feel like I died and crawled into a little restaurant heaven with all my favorite comfort foods.  Super quaint with a really nice staff and some pretty interesting flavors and dishes.  I was alone so I ordered the Dank Ass applewood burger and it was just that!!!   It was DANK ...  with wings and pig wings?  I have never had pig wings before and they were fantastic!!!   For the sauces they have some really cool flavors 100 to be precise.  With choices from spicy strawberry cheesecake to coconut like dry rub.  I ordered some pig wings with apple bbq and those were heaven.   Staff is super friendly and fun, the owners are super cool and you can see the passion in the kitchen with the food that is served.  I did order some wings to go with 2 sauces (I couldn't help it and didn't want to look like a total fatty ordering more food when I didn't even finish the first 2 dishes) I off course had to try the strawberry cheesecake and the sweet chili jerk. But wait ... I had to finish with dessert ... peach cobbler???   I won't tell any more about it because I don't want to spoil the big surprise...  Well all I can say is does not matter how full you are a little room for something sweet won't hurt anyone!!!   Hey your hurt in here and order some food I promise that this will be your new craving."}
{"text":"LOVE this place great food good price and tons of suace options for wings and the portions are huge."}
{"text":"Over 100 flavors of Chicken Wings... kids loved it and so did we! The deep friend pork ribs was good, very filling. The fries were bursting with flavor and comes in large and super large sizes to feed my family of 5!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and OMG the wings were fantastic! I know it sounds crazy but you have to try the spicy strawberry cheese cake wings with the yogurt sauce. They are a perfect balance of sweet, spicy and tangy. The pig wings with the Jamaican jerk BBQ was on point. We also had the medium wings which are more traditional but the sauce is satisfying and hit the spot. They have 80 sauce choices so there is something for everyone. We will be back."}
{"text":"Came here for the hype stayed for the wings. As most reviews states, there's plenty of flavors to choose. I had the  Tennessee Mild and Spicy Garlic  Teriyaki. Both were good. Tennessee Mild began with a sweet taste and ended with heat. Spicy Garlic Teriyaki well to be honest didn't leave a mark....I can't remember..Lol. There small fries were generous. Good for two. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Yesss!!!! The best wings EVER! I've only tried 4 flavors so far...96 more to go! That lemon pepper though!!! The fries were fresh out of the fryer and I don't know what is in the fry sauce, but yes indeed I'll take a gallon!"}
{"text":"Lucky for us a friend treated us to wings at Wing King a few months ago.  I must say they are the BEST wings we have ever had.  Hot, mild, dry rub...they have anything you could imagine.  We found ourselves in Las Vegas again and there was no doubt as to where we were going to eat.  When you are finished you must have the peach cobbler for dessert.   (next time I am starting with dessert....that way I know I have room for it).  Brittany is wonderful.  Very helpful and polite....and she is responsible for the amazing peach cobbler.....Thanks Brittany! See you again in a few months  Bill & Kim  from Pennsylvania"}
{"text":"WING LOVERS, YOUR SEARCH FOR DELICIOUS WINGS ARE OVER!  Just like you I was reading the reviews, (mainly Tawni and Tien's), I was compelled to check this place out.  So as I park and get out of my car, I see a big sign that says this place is an internet cafe. Huh? Am I at the wrong place? Then I remembered from the reviews that the whole place is a food court.   I walk up to the Wing King counter and Brian, the owner, was still getting ready. He sees me and politely asks if he can help me. I said excitedly \"WINGS, IM HERE FOR THE WINGS!\" So he takes my order and I sit down with my mouth watering to wait for my first bite.   So while im waiting, I tell Brian Yelp is what brought me here. Never mind the fact that I dont mind going to new places to try out wings, if it wasnt for Yelp, you would not be reading this review.  Ok so for the wings. There are 40 flavors. Yes. 40. I had garlic parmesan and garlic hot. Ok, so I love garlic. Dont judge me! Especially if you are a vampire! The wings were a little bit bigger than your average size. Brian asked if I liked it extra crispy. Hell yes I do! So after I devoured my wings, things like hole in the wall and a 5 star review was already embedded in my head. From my last conversation with Brian, he is already coming up with even more sauces like mango slam and honey mustard slam. This guy works his butt off to keep you coming back and I for one am one of them!  I also ordered garlic parmesan fries and fried pickles. YES, I SAID FRIED PICKLES! Both were off the hook and Brian also let me sample some sweet chili glazed fries. OMG it was some of the best fries I have had in a long time. Please refer to the amazing pics on here and your mouth will be watering. I guarantee it!  As I was finishing up, Brian just happen to serve me a peach cobbler fresh out of the oven as a token of appreciation. DAMN! If I knew he was gonna do that, I wouldnt of ate so many wings! I could only finish half of it.   Speaking of the peach cobbler, man this guy has some great desserts as well. I have tried the red velvet cake and the cookies. A special mention goes out to his rum cake as well. This is not a usual and its not on the menu but he made it for a customer one time so he decided to make two. One for the customer and one for whoever was lucky enough that day to be there when he put it out. Yes, I was there and boy oh boy it was awesome! If I ate any more I would need a cab to get home! Im sure he can specially make it for you if you let him know ahead of time so he can do his magic. That is the advantage of baking your own desserts! You can taste the freshness for sure! Oh, before I forget, Brian tells me he is in the process of bringing in Bluebelle Ice Cream. For those that dont know, that's only something that you only see on the east coast. So that alone should warrant a trip here.  If you are wondering, yes there is a really, really spicy hot wing challenge. The flavor is called Hell. No explanation necessary here. All I know is that I need to bring my friends that think they can pass this challenge here soon. Im also hoping we can make a Yelp event out of this. (Hi Misti! LOL)  So now after reading this you should be compelled to check this place out just like me. For complete info on their 40 flavors and other items, go to their website: www.wingkinglv.com"}
{"text":"My love for Wing King has not changed. Since my last review was 5 stars, im gonna have to bump this down to a 3. Why you may say? Read on.  Dont get me wrong. I love the wings, the plentiful sauce choices, and even the people that run it. But I have to be honest. There are several things that bother me about this new location.  1. Since its inside Adrenaline Sports Bar and Grill, only 21 and over customers can come and eat here. So that means I cant bring my kids and eat here as a family. Which leads me to the next gripe.  2. Smoking is allowed inside so that means that when you decide to eat here, at any given time there will be people smoking. I dont know about you guys but I dont like the taste of cigarette smoke while im eating. Not only that, if the place is packed with lots of people smoking, your clothes will smell like a fully loaded ash tray of cigarette butts.  3. You order wings by the pound now. Say what? My philosophy is, if it aint broke, dont fix it. Maybe change some things if it doesnt seem right. If you do change it, at least make sure its a good change. Whenever I ordered in the past which was most commonly the lunch special which was 8 wings, fries, and drink for 7.99, it always hit the spot. Now you have to go by pounds. I dont like it.  Now for why I love Wing King.  Before you had your choices of over 60 sauce choices. Now its over 80. Im always down for new flavors. My favorites are the Jamaican Slam, Mango Slam, and Garlic Parmesan.   Did I mention that you can have the fries tossed in any of the sauces as well? My favorite is Sweet Chili Glaze. Try it. I was hooked since day 1.  They also have Pig Wings. I call them pork on a stick. It's like drumettes but the pork version. Very flavorful and tender.  Recently they just added chicken and waffles. This did not appeal to me. The waffle seemed like it was from frozen and the syrup that it came with was weird. It did not taste like syrup at all.  Last but not least, they have some really good dessert choices. Things like Peach Cobbler, Red Velvet Cake, and Pound Cake just to mention a few.  In closing, when you first come here, from the outside it does look pretty sketchy. Its almost like a strip club setting. There are no windows and the entry door makes you think that you are going into some kind of strip club. Looks like I might have to order to go for eating here is not going to be pleasant. Sorry Brian. I gotta keep it real. Your wings are still the best. They are 5 stars. The location is 1 So there is your 3 star review.  Yelp 2015 review #16 515 overall"}
{"text":"Best place for wings in vegas is Wing King, no questions. Went in there ordered a Veggie pizza and Honey Habanero wings and wow. Im not big on Veggie pizzas Im more traditional but Ill definitely be coming back there in the near future. And very friendly staff. Awesome definitely A+++++++++"}
{"text":"Best wings in town hands down. Trisha is the sweetest and best server. Everything is always super fresh and good! Try the gouda bites!!"}
{"text":"New location. Same awful smoky atmosphere. Wings are still awesome. Yup. Pretty much just like my last review when they were at Adrenaline Sports Bar.   They used to have a lunch combo that had 6 wings, fries and a drink for $9.99. Here all 3 are complete separate items.  I ended up paying 12 and change for a 6 wings and fries. Soda you are supposed to get at the bar. Fortunately I had cold bottled water in my car.  What I got was my usual Mango Slam flavor for my wings and Fries tossed in Sweet Chili Sauce. Both were amazingly great as usual. That's what I love about Wing King 80 different flavors and you can have your fries tossed in whatever sauce you want as well.  Unfortunately the good food is where it ends. I had to eat the wings in my car so I don't contract lung cancer for the place smells like an ashtray full of cigarette butts. Even if it was non smoking you couldn't bring your kids here for you have to be 21 or older to enter  In closing, you will get really good wings here. I just recommend you get it to go. Unless you like cigarette smoke flavoring on your wings.  Yelp 2016 Review #25 597 overall  ."}
{"text":"The selection of flavors for the wings is outstanding. The service is also pretty good. It's a little pricey at over $1 / piece, but sadly that's becoming standard fare nowadays. If it were 10-15% less, I'd go weekly.   They also offer a vegan burger with beet juice inside it so it bleeds like a beef patty. Not bad, but it's only 4oz (1/4th pound). When I'm hungry, that just won't cut it."}
{"text":"Cheese Garlic Bread is delicious! Wings are complimented well with the fries! Satisfied my cravings!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch because I was at a clients house, rarely do I get on this side of town.  Owner was cordial, helpful and let me try the sauce before ordering.  The sweet mustard wings were great, cooked right and that sauce is excellent. I normally dont care about fries, but these fries were a great compliment to the wings.  Honored my check-in offer for a free desert. The owner gave me a generous portion of the German chocolate. Nice, moist and warm..downed it in 5 mins.   This is a nice set up offering great food. Will love to try more. This place is set for success."}
{"text":"Great wings! Nice relax environment. My wife loves it here. And the sides like the fried gouda bites and pickles were very delicious. Would come back for more!"}
{"text":"The wing sauces are . Lemon peper mild! Great service, down to earth servers, great atmosphere, and good reggae"}
{"text":"First time ordering from them, the wings are really good and I also got the pig snackers... the texture of both are amazing, just a tad crunchy... amazing, but the fries were waaaaay  waaaaay too salty. I know they would be the best fries, if they had a dash of salt instead of a pale of salt. Besides all that, I will def be coming back."}
{"text":"Great wings,,,,, any way you want them!!!! Burger was 1/2 lb and cooked just like I asked. Server (Nora) was very friendly and accommodating. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Against all advisement not to, I got the suicide wings because I was over confident in my spice tolerance. Let me tell you, they are aptly named! Regardless though, I did enjoy their flavor despite the pain. Brian, the owner, brought me out a bottle of water as I lay there, dying. Fries were good. The cobbler was AMAZING.  I can't wait to go back and try wings that I can actually taste also lol. I do believe that I will be a frequent Wing Kinger."}
{"text":"I've been here before they had their own restaurant when they were just a little booth and have followed them for years. It's no surprise that they're successful. They take time to create and perfect every little detail of their food.  Seriously go there if you haven't.   But I would like to give our server Kim a special shout out. She was easily one if the friendly and efficient servers I've ever had. That's a server that needs to be kept."}
{"text":"Very Good Wings!  Service was a bit slow but very nice.  100 choices of Flavors can't be beat plus the positive IRIE vibes echoing throughout the restaurant!  Made me miss Reggae Sunsplash!  The Breaded Fried Calliflower was excellent and the Green Chile sauce was unique and flavorful with a nice backend zip."}
{"text":"Its amazing how different taste buds can be. That PEACH COBBLER was wayyy too sweet for me and not enough pastry in the mix. I did not like it, but I did like Brian the \"Brotha\" with the cornrows, he was comic relief."}
{"text":"Let me just say, this is a very warm and welcoming establishment! Very great customer service. It was very hard to choose from 100 different flavors but Bianca the host, was very imformative about the kind of flavor that my taste buds sang with savory honey bbq homemade flavor. She knew just what i was looking for. Even introduced a decadent dessert the fried peach cobbler with a side of ice cream . pure  deliciousness! Definitely a good place to be and eat ! I would definitely take my family there again! :)"}
{"text":"I got the daily special that included 5 wings, fries, a drink, and a Hawaiian roll all for $7. I got garlic Parmesan and they literally used the Parmesan in a bottle that you can get at Walmart. To be honest I could make these wings at home. The fries were decent and the Hawaiian roll was good. Nothing really special about this place.   I also got a free desert for checking in here on yelp. I got the peach cobbler and it was pretty good and probably the best thing I got out of my whole meal."}
{"text":"Unfortunately our time here was way too long, at least an hour and a half for two of us. We wanted to try the Cauliflower bites, I think they are called. They were out of Cauliflower. Not sure how that happens.  We ordered Pig Wings with the sauce on the side. I never get sauce on my wings until I know for sure I will like said sauce. They came out with sauce on them and not even the right one. By now we had been there a good thirty min w/o food. They left those and said they would remake the ones we ordered. I took one bite and it was so dam sweet it was inedible. Once the other ones came out with the correct sauce on the side we had been there so long we ate one apiece and took the rest to go. These ones though were pretty dam good.  Not sure if I would go back at this time."}
{"text":"Love the vibe, loved what options I had but If I can leave less than one star I would. Service was horrible. We had to walk out because we waited 15 min for service before we walked out. We got waters, but couldn't even start us out with any appetizers to slow the flow down. If you want this place to survive be better to your customers because they are the ones that keep you in business. You guys have so much potential but it's wasted on the crap of service your giving to people."}
{"text":"Love this place...Awesome wings and service but PLEASEEEE bring back the dirt pudding!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Wing joints in town you definitely get your money's worth tons of flavors to choose from you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Honestly the flavor is other wordly, highly recommend! The location is great as well. Staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"1st time we came to this place and absolutely loved it! My husband ate 20 wings on his own. The manager is so cute and such a sweetheart. We Will be back"}
{"text":"The wings are  average,  but the flavors are very creative.  I love the flavors they offer. Very good value for money."}
{"text":"Maybe I came in on a bad day, but this place did not meet my expectations in relation to the reviews. The fries were... very very salty; so over-seasoned, which is a big deal coming from me because I love salt. Theirs was way too much. Ordered mango habanero chicken, it was really slimy. It probably needed a good 2-3mins before saucing. On a good note, the lemon pepper chicken (dry-rub) was cooked to perfection, and well seasoned. Crispy and tasty. It might be overpriced for the quality of food. I think Wingstop is just as good if not better."}
{"text":"Best wing place ever!  Multiple sauce choices with like 100 different choices. The corn on the cob was excellent and the sampler with traditional and pig wings was great. The service was excellent. Will definitely be returning. Found out new go to wing spot."}
{"text":"You will wait 50 minutes just for chickens wings.   The chicken wings are good but not 50 minutes wait Good.  One thing I notice is that that people come to the restaurant happy and cheerful after 20 minutes there's silence!!! after 40 minutes people start getting annoyed, you can see them starting to stand standing from there table ready to leave!! then after 50 minutes the chicken wings come out.   I will never go back to this place the women that took my order was high like weed high lol I'm not even kidding. I get high too but I don't get high during working hours. I'm never complain to the manager or anything I'm not that kind of guy, I just stop goin to the place. I'm not trying to get free food or anything. Listen guys most of this review of this place are probably fake. I went there this place is not wort it. You can get better wings in your local bar."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's such a hidden gem that no one knows about and it shouldn't stay that way. It's literally 2 minutes from my house and I love it. I'm under 21 so I can't done in so the only way to eat there is to order ahead and take out. The guy was really nice and all.  I came around 8pm on a Saturday. It wasn't busy at all. In fact everything was ready 15 minute after I called in. I ordered a 1/2 pound wings and 1/2 pig wings. It was the tasting platter or whatever. I got garlic Parmesan for wings and Tennessee mild for the pig wings AND I LOVE IT! There were only two pig wings for half a pound but they were huge, tender, juicy and great flavor. The guy said it's not that spicy and it was perfect for me. I think I'll try the sugar bourbon rub next time. And the garlic Parmesan wings? They were crispy, completed coated with Parmesan and juicy. I mean it was the best wings around here. I also got an order of fried Gouda and man you can't go wrong! The cheese was so crispy outside and oozing inside. Everything came up to around $18 and I was filled.   Definitely will come back for other flavor options!"}
{"text":"Trying a new wing joint to go. (New for us) The restaurant vibe is very casual just like being in the Caribbean. Bob Marley and other reggae music play throughout the restaurant. He ordered 2 pounds of Caribbean Jerk chicken (14 bones) and 1 pound of dry lemon pepper wings (7 bones), small Cajun fries, which is a pound by itself and 1 free fried cobbler with the Yelp check in.   Update to follow"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and let me tellll yyoouuu!!! It will not be the last!! I will be making a drive from Cali more frequently! Everything was just phenomenal, atmosphere was very relaxing. Whole experience is just an A+ !!!!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes after reading the reviews on here but sadly we were let down.   We ordered carry out and the food was super underwhelming. Keep in mind if you're ordering carry out they ask you for your credit card info in order to put the order in but don't actually charge your card until you get there...   Food:   1lb of chicken tenders EXTRA crispy with the mild garlic. Every single piece was soggy as if it were drenched in water. The breading didn't hold that crunchy texture like it should.. very mushy. There also was a hair stuck to the side of the tender so yeah....  1lb of lemon pepper bbq- I've never in my life tasted a lemon pepper wing so bland... decent sized wing though so they weren't a huge fail  Fries- these weren't bad but I was surprised the girl that took the order didn't advise that these are heavily seasoned. We were expecting plain fries... I could see this being a problem if you don't like spices!   We also received blue cheese instead of the ranch we paid for which was yet another let down.  Overall, we likely won't give this place a second chance after reading the reviews further.   2 stars because they gave us a refund on the tenders but made us drive all the way back there to bring them to them =\"}
{"text":"These guys gave fantastic costumer service! They were out of terriaki but they made more for me and I was happy to wait for it. Delicious wings."}
{"text":"The wings are very good and big. There are a lot of flavors to choose from.  But the price was higher than buffalo wild wings . I think that I paid about  $1.20 per wing. For 24 wings I paid over $35. Great flavor so maybe I'll try again when they're not so new, in order to justify the price. $$$"}
{"text":"The most amazing wings and strips I have ever had!! Please, if you are in Vegas, get off the Strip and get out to this place!!"}
{"text":"Ridiculous!!!!! Move over Hooters....BWW....and Wing Stop (Sorry Rick Ross) but Wing King is the new king in town!!! Went on a Friday night and it was busy but we were seated right away. We ordered wings and strips and Italian cheese fries....now this isn't fast food so the food takes a minute but it's hot and fresh and DELICIOUS!!! There are 100 sauces so get some a couple different orders so you can try them all.....the triple garlic medium was my favorite! I can't wait to go back and try the pizza and everything else on the menu!!!! They serve beer but no wine....my only suggestion would be to bring in a red and a white for us mommies that drink wine with everything  See you all soon!!!"}
{"text":"Wing king is the NUMBER 1 best wings in Vegas- hands down !  they have over 100 flavors and they are all good !  the customer service is amazing as always ! Love the vibe ! Brian is the best !!! Much love sugar"}
{"text":"This was my first time at wing king and I have to say, I'm very impressed. My girlfriend and I wanted to get wing stop or Buffalo Wild Wings but I wanted something new so I tried them and never regretted it. Everything was good, large portions, and they were cheap. I have to say that I will be back for seconds!"}
{"text":"MUST EAT! If you're in the area. We were visiting vegas for the weekend and of course used yelp to find all places to dine. We came across wing king and immediately felt drawn to it. CBD infused sauces?? Yes, please! We enjoyed the watermelon bbq and mango bbq wings + triple spicy garlic cauliflower wings (wish they were breaded and crispy). The wings were cooked to perfection and the sauces were on point. Had us licking our fingers for all the beneficial CBD properties. Our son enjoyed his grilled cheese and homemade french fries. Will be back next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"5 stars all the way. 100 sauce flavors and outstanding pig wings, traditional wings, burgers, and fries. Believe the hype."}
{"text":"My new fav is the garlic parmesan wings :)  I first learned about this place at san gennaro food festival last month. I know its not Italian food but I'm glad I stopped at their tent. I got some regular buffalo wings and the owner laughed.. and asked if I was sure since they offer 60 flavors. I'm a skeptic on new foods especially my wings LOL   Anyhow Ive visited the shop on Charleston a lot since then and even turned my family on to it.  Tried, honey mustard,sweet n sour,honey bbq,cool ranch and garlic parmesan...all amazing . Their ranch is a special mix perfect for a special wing LOL.  EVEN got my mom hooked on the cobbler... Mom doesn't do anyone's cobbler LOL so yes its   THAT good . Check em out Yall"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best wings and appetizers around...  all the food is hand prepared not the prefrozen stuff.   Friendly service and funky atmosphere ..  Rastafarian vibe.  I would definitely recommend this place.  Support local small business owners.   Chains are ok sometimes but you can tell the owner truly loves the food and takes pride in what is served."}
{"text":"New favorite wing place! The quality of the chicken here is awesome! Nice little crunch to the chicken on the outside, juicy on the inside.  I ordered the spicy boysenberry bbq wings and the triple garlic wings. Triple garlic was too heavy on the vinegar for me but I loved the bbq. I'll also get CBD on mine next time  With 100 different flavors I have to try all of them!"}
{"text":"The place is straight up awesome. The owner comes into my store (Smart & Final) a few times a week to stock up on things like to-go containers,portion cups and what not. Every time \" come on in man, you'll love it!\". well i finally went in, he was right!   I got the \" All day special\" 5 wings (boneless or traditional),fries, a roll and a drink ($6.50) and the an additonall 6 boneless($4.99). The flavors i got were garlic-mild and chipotle. Both awesome flavors! It took a little while to get my food, but it was worth the wait!  With 60 flavors(and I'm sure more to come) it's hard to go wrong, peach cobbler to die for. Go there now."}
{"text":"Wings aren't really my thing. Too much work to eat, but if they come prepared boneless then I'm there. With that being said, I can't say that Wing King is the \"King of Wings,\" but what I can tell you is that their other food items are pretty dang BOMB. Yeah, I just dropped the B-word.  I wouldn't have known about this place if it wasn't for the CMYE: Kaba Curry Tasting that my girlfriends and I attended. While waiting for our curry samples to arrive, we observed other Yelpers lining up at Wing King. One Yelper (bless your heart, whoever you are!) came by with samples of garlic parmesan fries and some type of chili fries; both were fresh and hot from the fryers. The samples were what tempted us to try the other items listed on their menu, such as the Jalapeño Bombers, Red Velvet Cake, Peach Cobbler, and Fried Pickles.   Peach Cobbler ($2.00 a bowl): My friend had been eyeing the cobbler for sometime, so she bought a cup for all of us to share. Peach Cobbler isn't a dessert I can say I love to indulge in, but this was indeed scrumtrulescent! The cobbler tastes homemade. It's as though there's a granny in the back kitchen whose sole duty is to make peach cobblers.The crust is the best part of the cobbler. It's sweet and it crumbles and melts in your mouth. *Homer Simpson drool*  Red Velvet Cake ($2.50 a slice): I want that cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake! It's not even my birthday, but I thought this was a fantastic start to my birthday week: sharing a slice of red velvet cake with my girls. Rumor has it that the secret ingredient to this cake is North Korean unicorn tears. I swear on a book of carpet samples that the cake was amazing and it will change your life. Ok, I'm exaggerating just a little, but it's one of the best Red Velvets I've ever eaten. When I heard that the Red Velvet was about to come right out of the oven, I headed over immediately to the counter and received the first piece. As I watched the cake being sliced, I could see the steam rising. Moist and sweet, I thought it was at its peak of deliciousness when the icing began to solidify. There's also bits of chocolate in the cake giving it a sweet crunchiness with each bite.  Fried Pickles ($1.49 for a small) and Jalapeño Bombers ($1.00 for two): We couldn't just have dessert. Sweet needed to be offset by something savory. My friends and I shared a small order of the Fried Pickles and two orders of the Jalapeño Bombers. The Jalapeño Bombers weren't spicy, but they were cheesy. The Fried Pickles were alright, but I thought they were too salty.  Service: The guys running Wing King are friendly and just seem cool. They even came around to pick up empty containers and plates for us after we were done eating.  Overall: So far Wing King's made a good first impression on me. I'll have to come by again to try some wings. Their \"suicide\" flavor wings sound like a challenge that I'm thinking about accepting.  Drop by Wing King if you're hungry and are in the area. It's located inside the Internet Cafe across the Charleston CSN campus."}
{"text":"Good food and try the HELL WINGS challenge if you dare!!!! Oh soooo good food yo!!!! Go get some"}
{"text":"This place is so bomb. The Jamaican spice wings are . I love coming here for a good time with the live music and cheap drinks. Get here before 9 and your good."}
{"text":"I really like the traditional and pig wings here. It's a little expensive, but the wings are much better quality than i could get at Buffalo wild wings.  I've gotten fries and fried pickles here, and the quantities they give you are huge, but they are not as crisp as I like in the takeout container. Better for dinner in."}
{"text":"This place is so good. I love the fact that they have so many flavors. The staff is great!"}
{"text":"It's ironic that I would review a Chicken Wing place. I dont eat chicken. I haven't for over 10 years. BUT, they do have sides and, from what I hear, kick ass desserts! I was meeting Tien at the internet cafe for lunch, which is where this place is. There are about 7 different food places to choose from. It's a food court, without the mall. Pretty cool concept, and it's right down from the college campus.  I'm there, on time , and while waiting*cough cough*, looked around at the menus of the places inside.I was getting hungry waiting for Mr. Lateness, oops, Tien, (I mean, who showed up 27 minutes late) so, I ordered the small fried pickles and a slice of cake.  I thought it was weird that it took a bit to get my order. I guess he was alone, but I waited for over 10 minutes to get my stuff. I did enjoy the pickles. I was surprised that it was such a large portion, as I ordered the small. It came with a kicked up dip (chipolte mayo maybe?). I enjoyed it quite a bit.  As for dessert? I was definitely full after lunch (we ate at the healthy place). BUT, the butter cake was delicious. The best part was the gooey stuff on the bottom. It was so yummy! Had there been more of that on the cake itself, it would have been crazy delicious.   I will be back at the internet cafe, I've got to try some of the other places, and I will return here for some dessert again!  Service, while slow, was OK. Prices were fantastic! Less than $5 for the pickles and cake!"}
{"text":"Husband and I have been looking for a new wing place for a while since we can't stand the thought of franchised Buffalo Wild Wings and their nasty fake chicken, stumbled upon this gem close by to our place.  I'd have to say, first look is kind of an eye sore, I had faith though and quickly realized you can't judge a book by it's cover.  In the little \"Internet Cafe\" which seems to be a college hang out close by to CSN, the best wings in town!  So many favors to chose from, their chicken is fresh and made to order!  My favorite was the honey mustard wings... So good!  I'm a boneless fan, we forgot to order boneless so had to deal with the regular wings but I'd say it was worth it!  Awesome either way I'm sure, but it was the freshness that really won me over.  Super nice customer service, we'll be back for anytime wing cravings!"}
{"text":"What can I say...Wing King lives up to its name.  The wings were meaty, and the sauces are homemade.  I love dry wings, so Debbie ordered the lemon pepper and the Jamaican slam sauce.  Next time, we will ask Brian to just to fry the wings, and have the Jamaican slam sauce on the side and we can dip the wings into the sauce.  Also, I like the fact that Brian will let you sample the sauces, and he can also make it more hot, less hot for your preference.  You can tell that Brian caters to his customers.  Also, when you check in on yelp, you get a small dessert with your purchase.  This is an offer NO ONE should ever pass up.  Why?  Because Brian makes the most delicious desserts!  OMG, the peach cobbler is to die for.  They have the right amount of crisp, peaches, and pastry dough.  Then the red velvet and too much chocolate cake slices...ahhhh, so moist and fluffy.  They were all so good.  Wing King also have an all day special, which is 5 pieces of wings (1 flavor), regular fries, regular drink and a Hawaiian roll, for $6.49.  That's an awesome deal!    Wing King is as good as it gets in my book.  Woohoo!"}
{"text":"French fries are great. Waffle and wings are a great combo. Their flavor list is outta this world, but totally worth switching them up. Cashier / only person in the kitchen was nice."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding and the service is excellent!! We had the chicken strips which are made to order fresh breaded and tossed in the sauce of your choice. Also had an order of fries which I think are coated in crack cause I couldn't stop eating them and a pepperoni pizza. This will definitely be a regular dining spot for us!!!"}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place but based on my experience it's a 2.5 right now.  I called in my order around 8:00 and arrived around 8:30 and still found myself waiting about ten more minutes.   The wait didn't bother me because I realize everything is made to order but I would suggest calling ahead about 40 minutes.  Based on the other reviews I knew what to expect as far as decor and that it was more of a food court type setting.  I ordered the Lemon Pepper Dry because lemon pepper is my go to wing flavor to which I compare all my wing experiences.  I also compare all wings to my fave spot from my hometown and to me they are hard to beat, which also probably makes me a little biased.   These weren't bad but they didn't wow me like I was expecting from the reviews.   Brian was very nice.  The desserts looked really good.  I do plan on going back to try some other flavors and the desserts did look delicious.  The dipping sauce that came with the wings was some of the best I had ever tasted.  Wasn't just your basic ranch, had more of a kick to it."}
{"text":"By far the best wing spot along with excellent customer service. Going big is the way to go here we ordered spicy blueberry bbq, mango habanero, mild, spicy strawberry cheesecake and they were all to die for but don't stop there because the fires here will satisfy anyone's appetite. Marion gave the best service we could ask for she was knowledgeable on the menu and was extremely helpful in pinpointing our taste buds, definitely ask for her when you come in !! The whole staff was friendly and checked on our satisfaction including the owner!! Definitely come by!!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of chicken!  Figured I should start with that.   But, Wing King pleasantly surprised me.  They have an excellent waffle with different syrups.  FRIED PICKLES!!!  And if you want a non-chicken alternative but want to try one of the 80 flavors; you can get pig snackers (individual ribs).  Don't worry pizza people, they also have 6 different pizzas on the menu and can add any of the 80 flavors."}
{"text":"A lot of flavors, service was quick and polite. A ways off the strip but for the quality it was worth it."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Seriously, amazing! Marion was our waitress and amazing and super friendly; she gave us samples of the sauce before committing was surprising and great! We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Will never eat here again my family and I went before I had to go to work and it literally took an hour to get my food. We ended up having to get it to go and I didn't even have time to try it. I'm so disappointed in this place staff needs to step up their customer service as well I had to ask for a house I ordered salad 2 times before they brought it out. The second time I asked she said they're barely putting it together"}
{"text":"This place was unique.. pretty good but a little pricey. We tried the lemon pepper dry wings and nothing ever compares to wingstop wings. The teriyaki wings were good and the pig wings were okay. I'd come here again if I was in the area but not make it a point to drive from the other side of town. Good customer service"}
{"text":"The wings are great perfect crispy. The fries seemed fresh cut and friend well. Thanks"}
{"text":"If you love wings, this place is a must try and they have fresh brewed sweet (and unsweetened) iced tea. The tea is a rare find in the valley, and Wing King has some of the better tea I've had in restaurants here. The restaurant has a reggae/irie theme and everyone is very laid back.  Not so laid back that quality and customer service aren't a priority; there's definitely love and pride in their food and service.  They have over 60 different wing flavors.  I'm not adventurous when it comes to spice, so it's nice that there is a decent selection of non-spicy flavors, with everything from a bourbon brown sugar sauce to a blueberry sauce.  I also like their \"pig wings\" pork selection and CBD infused collie buds (cauliflower bites).  Both can be done in the various flavors.  The CBD oil is optional on the collie buds.  The food has always been fresh and delicious.  It's a little pricey compared to other wing places, but the quality and the kind service makes that little difference somewhat bearable.  Wing King hosts live music on some evening, but I haven't had a chance to experience that."}
{"text":"This is by far the best wings I have tasted here in Las Vegas. They have hundreds of options for sauces! My favorites are chili lime hot and lemon pepper hot. I like my wings extra crispy and they always provide them when asked! Their fries are addicting! They also provide plenty of vegan options.   I love the reggae ambiance that this place holds. The staff is always super friendly! They have lots of space so go in and enjoy some delicious wings!"}
{"text":"If you are craving great wings, this is your place! 100. Yes. I'm not joking. 100 wing sauce flavors! If you can't find one that satisfies your craving, you can't find it anywhere! You even have to sign a waiver to try their spiciest sauce.  They have great choices for appetizers. Pizzas. Salads. Kids menu. And of course wings. They even have vegetarian/healthy option (baked cauliflower \"wings\")  They often invite bands or DJs to entertain their customers too.  Oh. And don't forget to try their yummy desserts ;)  So much better than other wing joints. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Half mild buffalo and half dry Jamaican jerk wings bomb! Fries are battered really good. House salad fresh and delicious. We will return, good quality food and well priced. A hidden gem best wings in Las Vegas. Miriam was really friendly."}
{"text":"Love the food, the prices, the people, the atmosphere  great place to relax and enjoy some amazing comfort food."}
{"text":"Came here today with my bf and it was delicious! My favorite is their fries!! It's breaded with something and it's really really good. Plus it's really  cool how they can infuse CBD into their wings.. I will be back!"}
{"text":"So, we're HUGE wing fans... We like them big, crispy and saucy. We decided to try this place after reading through the reviews, and after trying it out, here's what I have to share:  The wings are BIG and meaty... They weren't really crispy, in fact, the wings were soft. We tried the mild buffalo, the jerk, and the sweet chili jerk sauces. BOTH of the jerk sauces were zan amazing flavor. The mild buffalo was b*a*s*i*c at best. I think the wings were temperature hot at one point, then tossed in cold sauce. That's problematic. We also ordered the loaded garlic cheese fries. First of all, this serving is HUGE. It had great potential. Imagine the breading from a mozzarella cheese stick on a French fry with melted cheese. Like I said, it had potential. The fries were thick, hand cut, and UNDERCOOKED. Not crispy and crunchy like they should've been, and the seasoning lacked that Italian flavor that is mentioned in the title.  They were also served with the smallest ramekin of marinara sauce. Whaaaatttttt!!!! My son ordered a burger, which looked stacked and legit when it was brought to the table. There was a knife stuck in the bun to keep it altogether... It was about to be ON...except our waitress, took her fingers to the bun in order to pull the knife out. YES, full on contact, and acknowledged it, while it was happening. I was at a complete loss of words, and just couldn't say anything. So, sad to say, we won't be going back. I love to support mom and pops restaurants here in town, but Wing King has to kick it up a notch or there residency will be cut short. So much potential here... Let's get it together!"}
{"text":"I ordered Jamaican Jerk Slam and Jamaican Jerk Hot wings today and boy was I impressed.  It was my first visit to Wing King and the service was above and beyond my expectations.  I am picky when it comes to wings, I have never liked Buffalo Wild Wings or Wing Stop, they are always over priced for what you get.   What impressed me most about Wing King is the customer service I received.  I let them know it was my first time and when it came to sauces, they let me taste the top sellers and it helped me pick my flavor.  I could not wait to try to these wings as I had read so many reviews already!    I am not normally a dessert person, but please try the Red Velvet cake! It is so moist and delicious, you won't regret it! The cobbler was in the oven and I did not have time to wait, but I will definitely be back to try it!"}
{"text":"Uhhhhh, is this Heaven? No, it's Wing King. These were some super tasty wings. I'm swearing off meat and dairy come Jan. 1 (if I put it in a Yelp review, it has to be true, right?) so I'm going on a heyday in preparation. I had the honey mustard slam wings with some kind of sweet chili fries. I made sure to get the wings boneless (a.k.a. chicken nuggets slathered in sauce) so that I could snarf them on the way home. Don't worry, I created a bib and everything in case the delicious sauces should drip on my clothes. (In case you were wondering, I didn't need the bib because I'm just that good at eating.)  I literally inhaled the wings, though I can't imagine I'll be back anytime soon (both distance and the no meat/dairy prevent me from coming back) so I'm going to just recommend that you all go in my place. Go! Try the sauces! Eat them all! Oh and don't forget about dessert--fresh baked pie and cobbler and cake and a myriad other things. Love you, Wing King. Wish I could love you more (but let's be honest, no meat and dairy will probably not be a successful New Year's Resolution)."}
{"text":"After seeing this place on a national Food Channel show I had to fly out to Las Vegas and give them.a try.  I have been a Wings lover for over 40 years and this place will be added to my top 5 places for wimgs out of well over a 100 places.  Great taste at all levels.  I will warn the little ones should be caustioned when eating fries and mild wings will be VERY mouth warming. WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"My experience unfortunately did not match my expectations from the over abundance of five star reviews. The service was ok, however, the man bringing the food out to the tables had dreadlocks that hung down just far enough to touch the food carried on the tray he was holding above his shoulders. Thankfully our order was not brought out on the tray. The food was over priced & over seasoned. We started with the spinach stuffed mushrooms appetizer. Normally one would expect multiple stuffed mushrooms not one large portobello mushroom drowning in creamy sauce, chopped bell peppers, spinach & large chunks of tomatoes. The wings were over-sauced & too salty, couldn't even taste the chicken or pork! The mango habanero did not taste like mango nor habanero. My boyfriend said it tasted more like a citrus Asian sauce. Maybe they put the wrong sauce on? Who knows I don't care. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! The wings are great as well as the service. Don't be surprised if Brian comes to your table to make sure that you like the food. Can't wait to go back. Very diverse menu as well as vegetarian dishes. Something for everyone."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC wings. Big, meaty and well-done, in fact I think the woman who made my batch used a meat thermometer to be precise. I purposely chose odd sauces, they have 60: Sweet Chili Hot, and Jamaican Slam. Both were great. A nice touch is that, since I ate there, the food was served on plates, which reflects the very hippie vibe (Bob Marley posters, dreadlocked staff).  However, the environment is AWFUL. Wing King is really just a counter sharing space and tables with 5-6 other low-budget exotic food vendors in a building no bigger than a large McDonalds. Best bet is to eat elsewhere.  But DAMN the wings are good! Definitely a worthy stop for serious wing fans."}
{"text":"My husband wanted some wings last night so he searched Yelp and found Wing King. The menu looked legit, so we headed out. When we got to 'The Food Court' I was totally skeeved out. It's a random windowless building with a sign on the front. Doesn't look like anywhere I really wanted to be - but my husband was persistent so I caved. We were the only people there, and only 3 of the businesses were open. It was like being in a food court in the local mall - minus the mall. So weird.   We stood in front of Wing King for a good ten minutes before anyone even came out from the back, then they went back to where they came from without even acknowledging us. 20 minutes into our visit a kid came out and took our order, rang us up and we waited... for what seemed like an eternity. The long wait was apparently a blessing, as we reviewed our receipt. For 24 wings they kid charged us $222.98. Yes. Two hundred twenty two dollars and ninety eight cents. I promptly rang the bell and a corn-rowed gentleman (apprently the owner) came out and rectified our transaction, all the while trashing the employee to us.   The wings looked great, and the dry garlic parmesean weren't all that bad, they were just absolutely COVERED in grated cheese, which isn't our thing. Instead of one of our orders, they gave us mild, and the caribbean jerk was super sweet and then burning hot - so we didn't eat them.   Later that night we both weren't feeling so hot, and were consistently burping garlic parmesean....so we definitely won't be making a return trip to Wing King. :/"}
{"text":"Great wings! Try the Jamaican Sweet Chili and red velvet cake!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the new location! Tried two new flavors, sweet chili jerk and Cajun. Both were amazing. Enjoyed several drinks as we waited and would've stayed for the live music if the dog wasn't home waiting. Pool tables and TVs everywhere and great bar service."}
{"text":"Hands down best chicken you can get in Nevada. I had the burger today and DAMN! Talk about perfection. It was made just to my liking and the vegan homie said his incognito burger was the real deal. Can't wait to come back and try and chicken and waffle. Get some CBD added to your sauce cause it makes it BOSS!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb.com the wings and the fries are off the hook. Oh and great service (Nora is great)"}
{"text":"So far so good!!  It's hard to find a good wing spot so I was happy when this spot opened.  They have really really good fried pickles for an appetizer  They're definitely one of those places that charges you for every little thing tho. Your wings don't even come with a ranch which is honestly ridiculous  They have what they call pig wings and they're tasty! I prefer the smaller ones served as an appetizer"}
{"text":"This place is an incredible find! The wings are very good but the peach cobbler!!!!! The owner is the nicest guy and I have to say that I will have to go back many times and eat my way through his entire menu before I will determine what I will call my favorite. But right out of the gate I will say the peach cobbler is incredible... Did I mention the peach cobbler?"}
{"text":"Around the same price as Buffalo Wild Wings, surely something to try. For wings I will still be a regular at WingStop, seeing that the quality is the same and I like hot wings better there; but because there are still 97 flavors I could still love here I will swing by to try them. Something specifically I would come back for would be the Pig Snacks they were tasty, and no other place that I have been has these. The service was good fairly helpful with many suggestions."}
{"text":"Is it okay if I write a review for just the peach cobbler? Because that's what this review is about.  THIS IS THE BEST PEACH COBBLER IN TOWN, HANDS DOWN. I love treats. I'm all about dessert missions. I will drive the extra mile(s) for a Spectacular Melting Smores Sundae, chocolate fondue, and to continue my search for the best creme brulee in Vegas. I have also done this for the peach cobbler at Wing King.   I live off of Horizon and 95. Deep in depths of old Henderson. Google maps says Wing King is 35 minutes away from my house. While I have not done an official Wing King Peach Cobbler mission, the last times I have been there, I try to stock up.  IT'S THAT SERIOUS. IF YOU WANT PEACH COBBLER FOR DESSERT, BUY IT HERE. One day i'll get wings."}
{"text":"LOCATED INSIDE THE WHITE BUILDING THAT HAS A INTERNET CAFE SIGN OUTSIDE, on the south side of the street.  Delicious wings.  A plethora of sauces, 40 in fact, just brilliant.  Between you and me, what do people think makes a good wing?  The chicken or the sauce?  It's personal preference really and I admit to having better chicken elsewhere but the sauces and prices, for me, is hard to beat.    Some of my personal favorites are the sweet chili hot, Jamaican jerk, and honey habanero.  Everything with a kick.  They also have fries, baked beans, potato salads, mac n cheese, jalapeno bombs, Hawaiian sweet rolls, fried pickles, and dessert which includes cookies and cakes.  When you buy and eat from Wing King you support local businesses as well, another plus in my cookbook."}
{"text":"While waiting on my daughter to get her hair braided I stopped in here to have lunch. We ordered a few lunch specials which are wings and fries it's 6.99 I believe. Then I had 2lbs of chicken wings which is 14 wings I believe. This place has 100s of flavors to choose from including weed infused flavors. I personally don't partake in the edible craze, but to each their own!!! My friend had some and he said they were good. But he just about eats anything!!!! My son enjoyed his flavors too. I enjoyed my flavors too. Spice level wasn't what I expected, but it's cool. The waitress was very friendly. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Not only are the Chicken Wings ridiculously good but there are so many flavors to choose from! Unique flavors all around. The atmosphere is awesome. Brian Peace welcomes everyone with open arms. Definitely something you want to come back to."}
{"text":"My hubby is always on the search for tasty chicken wings and he found this place on Yelp. Neither of us was aware of its existence until now. We walked in for lunch on a Friday afternoon and there were only a couple of other people in there. That should've been clue #1.   The menu is huge with 100 different sauces for your wings! They'll even mix some of the flavors for a crazy combination. The menu has something for everyone, from salads and burgers to wings and fingers. The chicken wings and fingers are all sold by the pound, so come hungry. We took home massive amounts of leftovers (and we are both big eaters).  We ordered iced tea (fresh brewed but too weak), chicken wings, chicken fingers, and cauliflower \"wings.\" Hubby raved about the wings, saying they were legit spicy and were cooked as ordered (he got 'em well done for maximum crispiness).   I had the cauliflower \"wings\" which were a great concept but poorly executed. I got a huge plate of slightly blackened, roasted cauliflower tossed in mild buffalo sauce. It was very spicy to me and set my mouth on fire. The cauliflower was a little too \"soft\" and didn't really feel like the other veggie \"wings\" I've had at other places. I think a tweak to the recipe and preparation style would make this dish a superstar.   The chicken fingers were downright odd. They are super long (uh, how do they do that?) with a sweet and crispy coating. The flavor reminded me of the old Captain Crunch fingers from Planet Hollywood if you remember those! They were good but I don't think I'd get them again.   The sauces were all good, from the honey mustard to the super hot sauce. Service was good as well. The issue here is how slooooooow the kitchen is. Yeah, I know wings take forever to cook, but we were in the restaurant two hours. During the workday. No wonder nobody else was in here: don't come here if you have to get back to work! I knew there was an issue when there's a sign on the door before you even walk inside that basically says \"we're slow.\"  The restaurant has a Reggae theme and a decidedly 420-friendly vibe. I would dine here again but next time I'd call in my order beforehand. Honestly, heed my warnings: THE KITCHEN IS VERY, VERY SLOW."}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars, I would!   This is by far my favorite wing place in Las Vegas. With 60+ flavors to choose from, you will have a blast finding your favorite! (My personal favorite in the Apple Barbeque!) Everything is cooked when you order so no semi-warm or cold wings! You cannot leave without getting the Peach Cobbler! My mouth is watering just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"So delish! Alot of food for a great price and so many flavors! Plus they offer CBD for people that have pain and I think that's awesome! Great service loved our waitress! We will be back."}
{"text":"This is the best wing place ever! We ordered 4lb of wing with the Sweet Chili Sriracha, Sweet Honey BBQ, Triple Garlic Mild and Mango Slam sauces. We also had small fries and onion rings plenty for a family of five."}
{"text":"First of all, the woman complaining at the counter about how long she's waited for her to go order should've been my biggest clue.  The food was great. I got chicken and waffles and the syrup on the wakes was amazing. Even though the wake was swimming in the syrup, it wasn't overwhelming at all. The sauce in the wings was perfect.   The burger and fries my son got was great. And the so we're the wings my husband got.  So flavor wise, the food was great.  The reason I'm giving them 2 stars:  1. We ordered their parmesan cheese fries as an appetizer. We didn't get them until after mine, my son's and my husband's food came out. First, the server said they take a while to cook because they're hand cut, then fried, then they season it and cover it with cheese then baked to melt the cheese. She told me this after we'd been there for over 30 minutes and i asked about the fries. When we got our orders and still didn't get the fries, she then told us the cook over cooked them so they had to cook a new batch. So finally we're done eating or did and the fries (appetizers) arrived. Then she also told me the food takes a while cuz they only have 6 fryers. During Superbowl they had to rent more fryers to keep up with the orders. How does a wing and fry place not have enough fryers? After a while, she tells us they're comping the fries since we didn't get them until after we were done eating our other orders.   2. My daughter ordered a kids pizza which cost $10. So over priced for a kids pizza. The problem with her order was she never got it. After we'd already been there for almost an hour, I asked them about it and she said it takes a while cuz they have to too out the dough. Wtf?! A few minutes later we asked again and she said, they're cutting it right now, it should be coming out  so we asked for it to be in a to go box and we asked for our check.  3. There was only 4 of us and they couldn't bring out our orders  around the same time. First, I got my chicken and waffles. About 5 minutes later my son got his burger and fries. Another 5 minutes later, my husband got his wings. It was about 20 minutes later before my daughter even got her pizza. There were  3 tables of about 8 people each, and they were all getting their orders out together so they actually got to eat their food at the same time.   If the service was better, I'd give this place 4 stars because the food was good But their service sucked"}
{"text":"I have eaten in there restaurant once. I had their medium-chipotle, Asian fantasy, cajun lemon pepper wings and fries which were all  really delicious. But the second time we ordered take out... the same flavored wings as before and I decided to try the Jamaican jerk pig wings. Oh my! I should have ordered more than just a pound of those juicy and flavorful pig wings. They were absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, good friendly service, great flavors and always good vibes. Been here twice and enjoy it very much. Try the triple garlic mild. It's delicious"}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the CSN food commons.  I decided to try it on a whim one day.  I was glad I did!  I got the garlic Parmesan wings.  They were tasty and seasoned well.  The guy who helped me was so friendly and also gave me a pig wing to try.  It was so good as well!    Make sure to try their peach cobbler too!  It was delish!"}
{"text":"Wing King is a hidden Gem near Home Depot  The decor is Jamaican themed and they offer over 100 different flavors. The flavors range from hot, medium, mild, Asian, Dry, BBQ, and Fusion. They even offer 3 different cheesecake flavors. Wings are ordered by the pound and one pounds cost about 9 dollars.  The offer pig wings, chicken strips, collie buds  and samplers which is a combination of wings and pig wings. Pig wings are 4oz pork shanks tossed in your favorite sauce.  There are unique pictures posted all around and it's a nice claim environment. One people, one world, one love is plate in the entrance. They offer more than just wings. They have salads, burgers, pizza, chicken sandwiches, fries, & chicken and waffles.   2/1/2018  Today I stayed within my comfort zone and ordered a 1 lb of traditional garlic parmesan wings with fries. With check in I received a free peach cobbler with ice cream. Yum! My favorite was the peach cobbler & ice cream   They also offer reggae concerts.   I overheard one of the employees tell a customer Peace, Love & Chicken Grease lol. I thought that was a super cute slogan."}
{"text":"I love wings! Anything that I can dip in ranch makes my belly happy.   I thought that these wings were ok. However that being said, we ordered wings with the sauce on the side. I felt that it had a great crunch but was still moist inside but was missing flavor without the sauce type of deal. I like wings that I can eat plain and still have flavor but I felt like the only way it had flavor was putting on the sauces that they have lots of. Don't get me wrong, the sauces were good but sometimes it can be overbearing. I think if the sauces were mixed with the wings, which is how it is normally served then it would be delicious. Unfortunately I have two kids that don't like the sauces and like chicken wings too.   This place is pretty busy and our wings were nice and hot. I just wished it had more flavor plain!"}
{"text":"Food was very tasty service was awesome I loved all the art work we had ribs pizza chicken waffles peach cobbler wings and sweet tea definitely try this spot they have 100 different sauces for there wings the ranch was to die for I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Thanks to the glowing Yelp reviews we made the trek across town to this little gem for some wing feasting and happily enjoyed what have to be the best wings in town! I ordered the strips while my boyfriend opted for traditional, and also splurged on some French fries and fried Gouda bites- those of which I'm still craving the next day and seriously considering driving back for more! Both strips and fingers are done to perfection and all sauces we tried (with 80 choices available, there's something for everybody!) had a delicious homemade taste. The owner was kind to suggest that I try a new concoction of his which was a watermelon BBQ- what a treat! The generous hospitality we were treated with made a lasting impression and we will definitely be back for more soon. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Wing King was awesome! We researched the place place on Yelp and went there as soon as we got into Vegas. The business is inside of a bar, which is neat because you're able to eat wings and have a couple beers to pair with it. As well, the customer service was awesome and they had 80 different sauces to choose from. The best menu item there are the pig wings! So tender and delicious! For dessert, try the peach cobbler. So great!"}
{"text":"This are some of the best Wings I've had...and the pig wings are ridiculously good....plus there's 80 sauces...I keep trying a new one every time I go..."}
{"text":"this place is the mf SHIT! the wings, fries, mozzerella sticks, waffles, EVERYTHING i tried right now is AMAZING! i HIGHLY recommend everyone try it!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend noticed this place driving by and wanted to give it a try. We've lived near this place for over a year and neither one of us have heard of it or even noticed it until today.  First glace around, and there's a \"stoner\" feel to it lol. Photos by THCFotos, on the menu you can add CBD to your sauces, and the reggae music playing in the background.  The place overall seems really chill and laid back.  Prices...Lawd!! The place isn't cheap for wings! You order them by the pound and there around 7 wings per pound. My boyfriend got 2lbs w/2 flavors and they came to 17.99! That's a bit much for me BUT he loves wings so Yolo!  Wait time...At this location everything is made to order so the waitress made a note to tell us that just in case the wait time seemed a little long.   ......THINGS ABOVE WERE WRITTEN B4 I GOT MY FOOD...  The food arrived in like 7 mins if that of us ordering, super fast in my opinion!!   I ordered the Pig Snacks in triple garlic MILD & waffle waffle sweet potato fries. OMG! These fries were soooooo good, the seasoning was so good, never had sweet potato fries that tasted like this. It's like a bbq seasoning was added to them.  The Pig Snacks were like drum sticks but pork! They were good BUT i dont handle spicy food well. I ordered the MILD but i could only eat 3 of the 4 (i kinda forced myself to eat the 3rd one). It was so spicy to me! I should've asked for a sample of the sauce, even though it was mild, it was spicy to me. Overall id give them a 5 out of 10 because they were good but too spicy to enjoy.  My boyfriend got 3x garlic Spicy and Curry Hot...all i got from him was \"They are Good\" lol   Overall I enjoyed the fries, environment (music), and the staff. I personally wouldn't return because of the prices, but Wing lovers would want to try this place out because they offer 100 different flavors of wings!! 100!!!"}
{"text":"Best wings in Vegas, don't @me. They have a ton of different flavors, so I'll definitely be back soon. I had the Jamaican jerk and the mango habanero and both were amazing. I also got to try the apple bbq and they were superb as well. They had a nice atmosphere and a very friendly wait staff, as well as live music which was really cool"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place! The atmosphere,staff and most importantly the food! Super fresh and amazing flavors. So many to choose from! Cindy and the rest of the staff were very helpful! Always love coming here!"}
{"text":"I was a boneless man once, I came here expecting some quality boneless wings, but I don't think they have any available, I was a bit disappointed. Little did I know that this place would change me. I tried their wings and their fries. Delicious, right amount of sauce and seasoning, well cooked. Just perfect. I'm never going to BWW or Wingstop again."}
{"text":"Very nice place, people are chill, place is chill and food is great. I recommend it to everyone.will go back to try some of their other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Hippies are awesome! #Jussayin  The money I would spend if this place was known back in the day.. jk? Hah maybe;) Inside the building is pretty much like a food court at the mall, just without the shopping bags sitting all over the 'food' tables (-_-'). Everyone's a winner here! If you don't feel like chicken wings on that day, you can choose from Mexican, Korean BBQ, and Soul Food. And if you're not into any of that, you shouldn't be Yelping in the first place! #TrueStoryBro  For just two of us, it had to be the 24 piece wing combo including Cajun Fries (great tasty kick), and a couple canned drinks. The portion was perfect for a guy as small as me, and we did a great job picking the wing flavors. You must try the Mango Slam! Its sweet, delicious, and most likely as hot as i would go on my wings. Garlic Hot seemed like regular 'ol buffalo. Jamaican Jerk was perfect to a person like me who prefers spiciness for the flavor, and not burning myself later on the toilet. :/ Any-who, I shouldn't have to worry about that much since they have over 60 combinations of flavors to choose from! (Ri'wing'kulous).  The infamous/delicious/scrumptious Peach Cobbler was ordered to come out fresh after we finished our meal but we were already so full of the 'sin-food' so we took our time in unbuttoning our muffin top holder. Must say I regretted it... to sweet, tooo sweeet!! Pulling the diabetic again, sorry. Lol   Next time you have \"The Munchies\", I recommend stopping here at least once. The owners were awesome to us helping out us newbs and kept us entertained with their tunes playing among the rest of the cafe. I think Reggae music should only be playing when people are relaxing;)  #YesiSaidThat #iKnowHashtagsAreUseless"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I had to give a star; the only reason I did give any. I figure if by chance I don't get sick that's worth the one star. Otherwise, this place was not good to me and my family at all! We are avid foodies and really appreciate great food. At the same time we hate wasting money on horrible food. This place was a waste of almost $26! We ordered 3 lbs of wings (approx 7 wings per lb). 1 of sweet chili jerk 1 strawberry cheesecake and 1 garlic mild. It was late Sunday night so possibly the best cooks were off. The meat was so bland my crew refused to finish them. The sauce was an afterthought, meaning I probably would have been better eating baked unseasoned chicken then pouring some sauce in my mouth after a few bites. Think white looking wings with little specks of sauce here and there! And the size.... The wings were tiny! Think 1 1/2 bite size wings... At approx $1.25 per wing! Smh horrible! If your search app brings up this place as nearby, like mine did tonight, do yourself a favor and drive an extra gallon to somewhere else! Trust me, the $2.86 (I drive premium) is worth it!!! Never again! ***and if by chance management see this post. Please note the way to make me a happy customer is to refund my cc. Don't think a meal replacement could fix the boiled chicken wing taste in my mouth now."}
{"text":"Overall good place! Good customer service! Good wings & a lot of options to pick from. The fries are a little different in taste however they are good as well. Good atmosphere as well.   One thing is that they are kinda slow. We came in like on a Thursday afternoon and it literally was two other people there. The wings & fries took a while to come out. They can improve in that area.   Great place! Check them out!"}
{"text":"Great place, owner is one of the coolest, laid back people I've met in a long time. Decor has a great island feel, music outstanding and food.... Well food is out of this world!! Best wings in Vegas and possible best wings in the western region!! A must visit in Vegas, worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"Best wings I have ever had, and I'm picky about my wings! The pig wings are fantastic and they have so many flavors, really chill people who run this place. I went all the time while living in Vegas and recommend it to anyone I hear might be going to Vegas. Can't wait to go back next time I'm in town!  Also the fries are super good. Haven't been to this location but when they were at adrenaline they rocked!"}
{"text":"They really do offer 80 flavors! Husband and I tried the honey bbq, chili lime, apple jerk and of course the highly recommended strawberry cheesecake wings! Sounds crazy but all of it was delicious!!! John took our order and cooked it and was super nice!! Didn't get his name but the bartender was super cool as well!! Will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Great chicken wings and there big to also the pig wings are amazing and fries are great and they have 100 different flavors for the wings"}
{"text":"Good food with a good vibe inside! We'll definitely be back. The staff was friendly and accommodating.   If you like fries and cheese, the Italian Cheesy Fries are must. They have 100 different flavors of wings to choose from, which makes it hard to pick just one. We ordered the sweet chili jerk and lemon pepper, both were enjoyable. Their burgers are pretty good as well! I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu, really. If you have room for dessert, the peach cobbler with ice cream is amazing!"}
{"text":"-I cannot express my amazement with the sauce flavors. 100 different ones?! I can't wait to get back and try the next on my list.  -My wife and I started with an order of the Waffle Waffle Sweet Potato Fries. I nearly ate all of them. My wife was able to have about 5. They were amazing. The perfect blend of sweet and salty with a touch of pepper. That dipping sauce was awesome.  -For my entree, I ordered the strips with Spicy Honey BBQ sauce; while it was sweet and savory... MAN did it have some kick. I loved it!! I've got my eye on that Spicy Blueberry BBQ for next time! -Since we checked in with Yelp, we were given a free Fried Peach Cobbler for dessert. To say it was delicious would be a simple understatement.  -We will be back, with friends and very soon!  Thank you to our server, Alex. You were great! With a visit from the Wing King, himself, we felt like VIPs."}
{"text":"Hands down the best wing spot in Vegas! Trisha provided us with an amazing experience. Honey Sriracha was a very good flavor and Spicy Strawberry Cheesecake was interesting but very good. I would come here again and recommend it."}
{"text":"This place has quickly risen to my top wing spot. The flavors are excellent, sauce is well distributed on the wings, and the service was on point. 10/10 would go again."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying that the service here ROCKED!!!! I wish I would have got the owners wifes' name. She was patient and made great suggestions.  We ordered: Honey habenero-pretty good and not too spicy. Not too sweet either!! Apple bbq- really good. the sauce has a nice sweetness. Mild-I LOVED their sauce!! I dislike a super vinagery wing sauce, this one was perfect! Lemon pepper fries-SOOOO good!! They were the perfect amount of tart. Ranch-I'm not fan!! I loooove a good ranch for my wings. Why only 3 stars? Well the wings were not as meaty as I would like! They were even a lil scrawny IMO. For their main thing being wings I expect some MEAT ON THOSE BONES lol. Flavor was there bulk was not. I'm not a huge fan of the location :( I was very uncomfortable in the chair. I was happy to see they had high chairs for my babies though. It was kind of nice to be able to order a horchata from the mexican place!  I will DEFINITELY give these guys a nother chance though. I actually look forward to it."}
{"text":"Maybe the wings are good. I wouldn't know, because as soon as I walked in the smell of smoke was so bad I knew I wouldn't be able to taste my food, so I opted out."}
{"text":"The wings tasted like I ordered chicken skin with flavoring....the flavoring inconsistent where one bite was ok while the next tasted like it would callous my a**  even though I didn't order anything spicy enough for that....the fries were soggy just not my thing but I understand as a business owner places get busy and unfortunately people get compromised even when you have the best intentions growing pains suck........... I hope to try again and give this place a better review and chalk it up to a busy night sh*t happens RIGHT?! ..........UPDATE!..and if my review keeps getting bazarr this place has earned my five stars not only the mngr but the owner called high five to this place and to the owner and employees that care I love it they have gone from one to three to five in an hour great mngmt cant wait to give another try awesome!"}
{"text":"Well, I was trying to find another wing place (that delivered) after trying out another in town and I was very disappointed. I settled on Wing King because I had been following them on Instagram and all their food always looks delicious.      I wasn't quite sure if they delivered and they were not on any third party delivery service so I contacted them through Facebook. I received a response right away from Brian and he assured me they do deliver and no order was too small (I was only ordering food for two people).           Around 2 PM I finally called to put in my order and the girl on the phone was awesome! So polite and wanting to help. I ended up ordering four lbs of chicken tenders for $32.00, with four different flavors: Honey BBQ, Garlic Parmesan,Garlic Teriyaki, and Sweet and Sour. The girl also threw in ranch and their garlic butter.     When the food was ready I received a call from their delivery driver, David, just to let me know he was on his way and to quote me on the time. Really cool! Our food arrived on time and the driver was super polite and courteous.       We tried the tenders and they were DELICIOUS! Their Garlic Parmesan was perfect for my liking and my second favorite was the Honey BBQ. The Garlic Teriyaki was great and also the Sweet and Sour, although the boyfriend doesn't eat a lot of spicy food so he stayed away from the Sweet and Sour which had a little but of a kick to it. Their garlic butter is now one of my new favorites to dip with the tenders, then some ranch!      Really awesome experience and I'll definitely be a returning customer! I'd love to try other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!! The Restaurant has a really cool vibe. I ordered the triple Garlic hot chicken fingers, the smallest order is huge a whole pound!! I ate them for like three days!! They were delicious!   Also, the fries I will not lie, they were the best I have ever had hands down!! You have to eat them there though because taking them home in a styrofoam, well you know doesn't keep them crisp.  But the flavor for all of it was on point!  Only negative is you have to pay for ranch?? Not sure who would eat Spicy chicken fingers without it, that's just weird.  Also , for all those fingers you need at least two the containers as they are really small. Fries are separate too.  15.00 bucks for lunch, super delicious but come on guys toss in the ranch!"}
{"text":"Even though it's in a casual little bar named Shooters- that yes allows smoking ( it is Vegas still after all)- the trip is totally worth it! The wings are sooo bomb! And where else can you get 80+ flavors of sauce including spicy strawberry cheesecake that comes with yogurt for dipping sauce?!?!?!?  The fries are also to die for! The \"sister\" shop is in Bubbys University on the West side of town on Haualpai!!  Soooo good! Cant miss! Try both spots!!! You wont regret it.   On a side note tho....  I had my vintage cigarette case stolen from me right from under my nose while sitting at the bar. When I confronted the only person who could have possibly stolen it, they denied it. When I said I would call the police they scrambled fast! Super sucky. It belonged to my grandmother. With that being said, bring your appetite, but leave anything valuable at home and keep your awareness game on full throttle. Karma is only word I can use for the loser thief's. Enjoy."}
{"text":"HOLY SHIT. Eat Wing King now--thank me later. These are the best wings in the entire world. I put the brown sugar bourbon dry rub on some traditional wings, and let me tell you- the sky opened up, a light shown down upon my table, and I saw god. He bore a striking resemblance to Bob Marley... also, the Italian cheesy fries are amazeballs (worth the wait)"}
{"text":"Best wings in town hands down. I am so glad I found this place and it's right down the street from my house. A win win."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Waffle sweet potato fries, sauces, house-made dressings, fresh veggies (salad) and the traditional bone in chicken wings are all amazing. So many sauce flavors from which to choose. Loved the dry rub honey garlic traditional wings. Kids loved it too. Such a unique and chill atmosphere. We discovered a new hometown favorite."}
{"text":"They used to be good when they were Charleston. Was not impressed with their chicken wings and they barely had sauce."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent wings! Seriously, with so many flavors to choose from it took me a while to decide but once I did I wasn't disappointed at all. The chicken was juicy and tender while the sauces were really well balanced and the regular hot wings had the perfect amount of spice for my palate. Their fries could have had some seasoning or even a bit more salt and the fried pickles were cut so thin that they were more like dry pickle chips than juicy battered fried pickle slices but seriously, I don't care. The wings were that good. On top of this, I feel like they went way above and beyond because when I got my food, the driver, who had mistakenly gone to the wrong place actually told me that he didn't want a tip. He said, just come and eat at the restaurant if you like the wings. Well, I loved the wings and will most definitely be back there soon!"}
{"text":"The best wing i ever had ! I came here two times and both were delicious. It took while for the pig wing but it totally worth it. They have also lunch special with only 6.99 for 5 wings half pound of fries and a medium drink. I will come back more and more. You should try it one time !"}
{"text":"I went to this place at the last location on Sahara and it was amazing ! Moving forward , today I had a horrible experience ! Referring to your self as WING KING is pretty high . I would prefer wing peasant.  The wing are very unnormally expensive . They do not come with a dipping sauce no matter how much you order . They have 100 flavors (+) but they only Let you try 2 a table (-) . I believe that is very unreasonable . I don't think it's a good spot to watch a game based on how the TVs are set and the servers are EXTREMELY rude .  You can't customize your order any type of way and they are NOT the \"WING KINGS \" . I've have better times at buffalo , and that's pretty generic .  I will not return and believe they have took a negative path from the last location .   They presentation is amazing  Photo : garlic parmesan and sweet chili jerk   AND NO, they do not offer carrots"}
{"text":"My buddy and I wanted to try a new wing place.. hit a jackpot.  We got them to go, but the server who took our order was very friendly.  The wings themselves were high quality and cooked perfectly.  They are known for a huge selection or sauces and rubs.  I got the extra hot, but it wasn't hot enough for me.  I'll get the next level up next time.  To think I wanted BWW.."}
{"text":"Probably the best wings I've ever had in the states. Servers and staffs are friendly and willing to answer to questions asked by newcomers like us.   Since it's out first dining here, we ordered a 2 lbs sampler - Hot Wings and Honey BBQ pig wings, 1 lb each. Pig wings are huge, succulent and juicy; hot wings are hot! Yeah they are the ultimate indulgence, and you have to taste the celery as well!   1 lb of wings is about 7, and a lb of pig wings is about 4 huge ones. Make sure your tummy is absolutely empty before entering. Lots of diners couldn't finish what they ordered and had to pack them in boxes lol"}
{"text":"Excellent selection of flavors for wings and fingers and the fried pickles and french fries are fuego. The workers are passionate about the food and offer suggestions on the different ordering options, making for an easy choosing environment. If you like it hot you can add hell sauce to any flavor to kick it up a notch. This is definitely one of the best wing spots I've ever visited in Nevada and I will be frequenting this establishment often."}
{"text":"I loved the decor & ambience of Wing King. Super chill & relaxed with a feel of Hawaii. The customer service was good but not great, which was why I didn't give it a 5 star review. I was a little peeved when I saw my bill had 2 charges of $0.69 for ranch. I didn't order any ranch. I ordered wings & was when I order the wings the waitress asked if I wanted ranch or blue cheese making it seem like the side was included, not additional & definitely not for 2 when I only order a small order of wings & didn't even finish 1 of them.   Now the food was GREAT!! There is a long wait time but everything comes out fresh & delicious. The wings & pig wings are both fantastic. They have 100 sauces!! I just wish you could sample the sauces, since they have so many options. I also ordered fries & a bbq burger, which were amazing! I ordered the burger medium & it came out more medium rare, which was fine by me. If you don't like too much pink then I'd order well or medium well to be safe.   All around I would definitely go back for another try because the food is so good. I just hope the service improves & I don't have extra unexpected charges."}
{"text":"It was my first time coming here and i was overwhelmed at how many flavors there were. I believe there were about 100 flavors so it made it quite difficult to choose. Overall, it was okay but I feel it's not up to par with BWW."}
{"text":"A coworker told me about this place and said it is a must try! I love wings so I had to give this place a shot. I ordered for delivery and they charge $3 for delivery and an additional $1 for each mile, so I ended up paying $7 for delivery fees. Anyway, I ordered the spicy garlic parmesan & Jamaican jerk medium spicy flavors with a side of fries. I wanted a peach cobbler as well but they ran out. Someone called me telling me my delivery person couldn't find my apt because I didn't give them my building number, no big deal but if they paid attention at the gate they would see that there is a map that shows all the apt numbers. I never give my building number when ordering delivery just cuz honestly I forget and everyone seems to find it just fine. Well about a min. after that phone call someone else called me asking for my building number and I told them oh yea I just spoke to your boss and told him, he kind of got offended and was like he's not my boss! L0L. Oops I didn't mean anything by it dude, chill. Oh and by the way the dude who called me the 2nd time sounded so freakishly creepy like trying to sound all sexy but high at the same time, I had him on speaker and my bf & I looked at each other like WTF, L0L and if that's his normal voice I don't even know what to say, haha.  Anyway on to the food, my spicy garlic parm wings DID NOT have any spicy on it whatsoever they must of forgot that one ingredient but the Jamaican jerk flavor was good. The fries were a little weird though, they put some weird coating or whatever and I couldn't tell if it was just cooked in old oil or what. The wings weren't to die for as I hoped for just mediocre. In fact it made me & my bf had bad stomachaches within an hr of eating it. I ended up throwing out the leftovers because I didn't want to be in the bathroom for hours again, haha."}
{"text":"Didn't try the food, but called to make an order and the man was rude. Yelled saying he couldn't hear me, didn't tell me how much my order was, didn't ask for a name, just said give me 10 minutes and they'll be ready and immediately hung up. How do they know who I am?! RUDE!!"}
{"text":"It's not bad- but very odd. It's hard to explain-  but it's not a typical wing place you'd think.  IF you are going to give his place a try I'd much advise you to order the pig wings instead of chicken-  much better flavor and don't taste frozen and over cooked dry.  The sauces and flavors are pretty good.   I guess what I couldn't get over was the reggae vibe but they forgot to take down the ristras from when this place was a New Mexican restaurant -  hanging red chile pod decorations.  As well they left the Luminarias up too-   The tables (which look like the same tables from before) were hastily painted black with latex based pant so they are sticky and \"dirty\".    The, I'm going to assume owners, were nice though.  I'd say maybe just take an extra week or two, go through the place and really make it their own, and refine their product and this place would be a lot better."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped by to watch the game on a Sunday. We did not expect that Wing King would be a stall inside of the bar, Shooters, but it all turned out well. The bar is a dive, but Wing King has a few tables off to side by their window.  We ordered 14 lbs of wings, since their sign said that there would be about 7 wings per pound, but the staff informed us that a large order had just come in and they may run out of wings. They offered to substitute some of our wings with tenders. We told them that was fine and we ended up getting what must have been closer to 20 lbs of wings and tenders! (see all my pictures, that's everything we got).   I prefer dry rubs and wings to sauces and tenders, but overall, I was pleased. We got 8 different flavors, but the extra hot and the spicy garlic Parmesan were my favorite by far. The service was friendly, and probably gave us extra food to make up for having to mix wings and tenders"}
{"text":"Endless amount of flavors! Well, I think they have 100. Can't go wrong here. The flavors are unique. The flavors are delicious. And so many to choose from!! The restaurant is set up nice. Clean and friendly staff. You have to come try this place. The owner Brian is super down to earth and a great guy to chat with. Probably one of the best places to get wings from in Vegas."}
{"text":"My all time favorite place!! Everyone here is like family, and the food is always amazing! Wing King never disappoints"}
{"text":"I got the dry lemon pepper seasoned traditional chicken wings and it was good. The flavor was great. I also got an order of the pig wings with the triple garlic seasoning. The seasoning taste was okay, nothing really special, but I did not like the way the pork was cooked. It was tender, but the skin was burnt. I had to cut the skin off because it was like eating a card board box. If I had ordered and ate at the restaurant I would have told them to take it back. The chicken wings were good but the pig wings I would not order. If you have the same problem, send it back and complain."}
{"text":"Wings was over cook..and that took 45 min when was told 10min ...I was the only person there...also false advertisement order the lunch special which set comes with drink and did not ..ask the cashier and she said its a old one so way do u have it on the counter of your restaurant ..to miss lead everyone.."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing. Service not so much. They always have a 40-45 min wait for take out. Maybe only have 1 cook. ??? Gentleman in front always seems panicked. Calm down dude. Needs more servers and apparently cooks. But like I said food is BOMB."}
{"text":"This place has great service.. They suggested the spicy strawberry cheesecake on my pig wings. I love strawberry and thought what the heck. Let me say it taste amazing. Peach cobbler was like what my grandma use to make. Very good. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Great burgers, pizza, and off course wings! This place just opened a couple months ago and totally worth our Saturday night. We ordered the Green Dream Burger and the meat was juicy! The White Pizza was also delicious. Ordered the 4 lbs wings which consisted of Honey Mustard, Seasoned Hot, Kool Ranch, and Sweet Chili Sriracha and all were very tasty! Definitely our go to from now on when the cravings hit."}
{"text":"I been meaning to go to this place and really a few of the vendors in the internet food court cafe, but it often gets passed up for better ambiance than what is essentially, a extended cafeteria for the college crowd.   The BF and I got 16 wings in Mango Slam and Parmesan Garlic. The mango slam had a nice jerk flavor with some sweet fruitiness. The parm came with a lot of grated parmesan, but the flavor for me was just OK. I ended up dipping them in the mango slam since that was more my type of flavor and the BF picked the garlic parm. The wings were a good sized and crispy though.   Fried pickles were nice thin pickles so they fried up like chips. These I really liked. It came with some ranch type dip, but this probably would be awesome with some mustard based sauce. We got a regular, but the basket was rather generous of a portion.   The fries came seasoned and are skin on. These reminds me of fries at places like 5 Guys and are rather solid if you like those thick cut natural skin on type fries.  The check in offer is with purchase is a free a dessert. We got a slice of rum cake. It was good, but maybe a bit too boozy since it was straight soaked in rum, If you want a buzzed dessert though this is for you.   So the ambiance looks not like much but the wings and the fried pickles hit the spot so I would be back during lunch when I just want a quick bite. It would probably be a good to-go place  or a spot to get a big ole tray for a get together."}
{"text":"This place was awful! Who screws up sweet potato fries? They were covered in garlic powder...gross!!! The pizza wasn't very good and the wings were over cooked!"}
{"text":"Wing King never disappoints! New on their menu is \"Pig Wings\".  They are kind of like rib tips, but they come from a different part of the pig. They are much more tender than rib tips and a whole lot more meatier.  They are fried up in no time and can be prepared with any of the flavors, although any of the BBQ flavors would probably be your best bet."}
{"text":"It's so good I can't stop eating! Amazing food! Amazing service! Amazing vibes! Amazing deep fried peach cobbler and amazing colliebuds wings for vegan/vegetarians! I'll be back every time I'm in Vegas. Thank you Wing King."}
{"text":"I have been hearing rumblings about Wing King for a little while now. I never even had the desire to give it a shot because of it's location in the Food Court building by CSN. I gotta say you can't really judge a book by it's cover. Let me set the scene up for you.. I place my order over the phone and walk in 20 minutes later to the background music of Gansta's Paradise. Automatically that's a bonus point, and from here on out I'd prefer to enter most places with Coolio singing my real life soundtrack. Any place not playing Gangsta's Paradise automatically loses a star. Ok, sorry for getting sidetracked.   Upon entering, the place was a little smokey, but not because of the Bob Marley posters all around if you know what I'm saying. It had the smokiness of poorly ventilated fryers. It wasn't overwhelming. I've worked kitchens before, this was pretty mild and you get used to it immediately. The gentleman that helped me, Brian, was a nice polite guy. I told him I've been hearing good things about the place and wanted to check it out. There was a check in offer for a small dessert, so that was awesome. I opted for the chocolate bundt cake, because he said it was the freshest. He also went out of the way to pop everything open and verify the order was correct. And then he wrote on the cake container to microwave for 20-30 seconds. He said it makes it nice and gooey like a brownie. I cant begin to say how much the tiny attention to detail was appreciated. I love when a food service establishment goes out of their way with customer service, mainly because a lot of places tend to get that part dead wrong.   I tried a bunch of different stuff. The french fries stole the show. I'll get that out of the way up front. They had an awesome seasoning on them. I got boneless and traditional wings in the flavors of Parmesan Garlic, Spicy Parmesan Garlic, Mango BBQ, and Mild. I'm a huge fan of Parmesan Garlic at most places. This place wasn't particularly the best though. It was just ok. I enjoyed it, but I've had better. The spicy version tasted off. It was my least favorite of the four. Mango BBQ was solid. Sweet with just a small kick of hot. And Mild was... well Mild. It was a safe bet and it didn't disappoint. The Mac and Cheese was a let down. Not expensive, but not on some BFG level or anything. I'd skip that altogether next time in favor of a bigger size of fries. Did I mention the fries were bomb? Because they were. Mmm, I can taste those seasonings now. Also, the cake was pretty good. Nice and fresh and satisfying.   If you are in the area and craving wings, definitely try this place out. I'm going to go back to experience some more flavors and of course, the fries. The pricing on everything is very reasonable and you should be able to find something you'll really like... Especially if you order their french fries."}
{"text":"Can I say AMAZING  wings? OMG so many flavors to choose from I didn't know what to choose. They will let you try a few samples if you're not sure. Very clean and awesome customer service. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing wings!! Garlic Teriyaki was fantastic. This is definitely a must try for wing lovers!"}
{"text":"Veeeerrryyyy sloooooooowwww service. Ordered a 5 Wing special and i think I saw them rubbing 2 sticks together to start the fire underneath the fryer.  Then they touched the food with their bare hands (yes I'm serious). I told them to eat it themselves, even though I prepaid....$7.00 down the drain. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"First of all, this is a cafeteria style eating setup.  There are multiple food \"stands\" here, and you eat in a small area that is shared with others.  Not a big deal to me, but don't expect BWW or other establishment.  It is a cool idea though, more for college kids I think, since it is right near CSN.    Ordered the fried pickles, jalapeno bombers, and traditional wings of course.  Pickles were good...it is the sauce that makes them actually.  The pickles by themselves didn't do much for me, but the cajun/mayo/ranch whatever it was is pretty solid and goes well with the vinegary/saltiness.  Jalapeno bombers were not very good....pretty bland...would not recommend.  As for the wings, I saw them cook the entire batch at one time.  But somehow, some of them got overcooked and dry, others were absolutely perfect.  There were some with a lot of blood vessels or whatever it is called, and one of mine had a broken bone with marrow all around the insides and chunks of bone pieces...yuck.  These must be frozen and transported via UPS freight (jk...kind of)....  Tried the parm garlic, mango habenero (I think), and carribean jerk bbq.  The garlic parm was ok...the habenero was like a basic hot to me...both were good, but not great.  What WAS great was their carribean jerk.  It was an excellent, spicy mixture of bbq and jerk'ness and really really wish all the others had that much thought and love put into them.  Since all the other reviews seemed great, I must have had a bad experience or bad choices in sauce at least.  If the wings were cooked right, it would have made this a 4 star, and more than one solid choice in flavor, would have bumped another outta me.  I guess I will stick with the chain restaurants for solid and consistent wings."}
{"text":"Okay, saw the many great reviews about this place and it kind of made me not want to write this one but on second thought, I think it only fair to everyone that we tell it like it is.  The sauce which makes the wings were okay, nothing to jump up and down about, had the Teriyaki, and Med. Hot, and also tried the Dry Cool Ranch.  The wings were over fried and dry, nice crunch but just too dry and small wings at that, Wingstop had much bigger wings.  Mac and Cheese was tasteless and the Parm & Garlic fries was also pretty tasteless.  It may have been that the oil was too hot but they should know better since they are the Wing King.  Waited half an hour for 24 wings with the sides.    Went on a Sat. night at around 7p.m., 3 out of the 5 food stalls in there were either closed or out of business, only Wing King and the Soul Food stall were open.  Maybe these businesses are geared for the CSN crowd??  Just wondering why so many 5 Star reviews?? Did I miss something??"}
{"text":"How about when you run out of something you tell the table when they sit down.  Thanks for wasting my time."}
{"text":"I can't  believe I've haven't known about this place, and it's so close to home! There are over 80 flavors of wings here, and I can't wait to try them all! It is inside of a bar, but don't let that drive you away. It has some fun bar tenders and good rock music. Went here with a buddy, and had an awesome time. The guys making  our wings were cool people, and even let us try some of the flavors we were curious about. You love wings, this is the place to go to."}
{"text":"Maybe this is the standard for hot wings nowadays but these wings were so small, but very very tasty. This place offers tons of different flavors but I'm a vinegary,buttery, hot wings kinda girl (I know, BORING)  like I said they were delicious but I think I will just make them at home my self and get like 20 for the price of 7 here. They have a very big menu, not just wings ...."}
{"text":"This place is good and bad at the same time. I would give it 2.5 if possible. First the good. Great selection, really cool atmosphere and music (assuming you like Reggae), the \"pigs wings\" are an excellent idea. Now onto the average. The food was just ok, I was expecting something superior to Wings Stop and was left disappointed. The bad. Apparently their waffle maker has been broken since November- they should remove there chicken and waffles selection if they are not going to fix the waffle maker. The fried pickles are incapable  of being eaten - they are shockingly salty. We ordered a four pound sampler and only one tiny ranch sauce comes with it. They will happily  give you more ranch at $0.69 per order. I had never been charged for ranch sauce before. They allow you to sit yourself while many might feel this is charming and friendly the concept doesn't work when a place is busy. As we were seated we saw other people who wanted to sit at dirty tables. The staff does their best to clean the table as soon as possible for the customer, but the customer is left to seat at their 2nd choice while waiting for this to occur. The whole process leads to chaos when they are busy. Our waitress, whom was very friendly, was filthy. I have worked in the restaurant industry, I know you get dirty. This was a different level. I didn't really want her near my table. The management needs to insure their employees go in the back and use a clean wet rag to try to clean themselves off on occasion. The last thing a customer wants is to be served by someone who looks like they lost a fight with an exploding food processor.  All in all I would not go back. Cool atmosphere - average food - nice staff, with terrible hygiene."}
{"text":"I am a huge wing fan and this is honestly the best food I have ever had. The burger was amazing, the wings were perfect, and the lemon pepper fries was the cherry on top. Me and my wife will definitely come here again!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, pretty low value. I got the 1 pound sampler, which is half a pound of chicken wings and half a pound of pork shanks, for $12. With the sampler you at least get two flavor choices, unlike ordering a full pound of one item. But you get nothing whatsoever with your main item - no fries, not even dipping sauce. So you're paying a lot of money for a very basic food. They were tasty and my server was friendly, but with ranch, drink, and tip, I paid $19 for a handful of wings, and at that price point, I won't be repeating."}
{"text":"Omg you have to try spicy strawberry short cake chicken strips .... wow wow there is ober 107 flavors..."}
{"text":"I got their lunch special that had 5 wings 1/2 pound fries and a soda for 6 bucks! Went with the medium lemon pepper well done and added some CBD to it. I really enjoyed the sauce and I got a side of apple BBQ sauce which was very tasty together. Nora was a great attentive server. Thanks for your help with your recommendations. Can't wait to try rest of the menu"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing. First off my waitress Tricia was AMAZING. So friendly and made my experience worth dining in for. I came in after work craving wings and got the Triple Garlic Hot chicken fingers 1lb. But I also tried the Sweet Chili Hot sauce omg it was amazing. Breading a little heavy so just be prepared. The order of small fries were huge haha and the flavor was different than anything else I've ever had! Fried in some kind of Cajun flour. And they're having live music later! Definitely gonna come back"}
{"text":"The wings were cooked to a perfect crispness. I had the brown sugar bourbon dry rub and it was delicious! I got ranch for dipping but honestly didn't need it. Didn't want to ruin the flavor of the rub. Also tried the onion rings. They were ok. Next time I'll try a different side.  Oh and the peach cobbler! I won't say it's better than my family recipe but I will say that if it would up at a family dinner no one would be upset. So good! I got my food to go and the service was fast and friendly. I'll definitely be back to try another flavor... The bbqs caught my eye."}
{"text":"Wing king is the absolutely the best chicken wing place in vegas. Nora deserves the nobel piece prize you are da shit"}
{"text":"Yum a ding a ding dong!! We had the triple garlic, Carolina gold,  and curry! Soooo good!!"}
{"text":"While some of the sauces are pretty good, I can't fathom ranking these wings as anything close to the best wings ever as my esteemed yelpers have commented. That said - the wing's definitely ain't bad! There's a long list of sauces to choose from at all levels of spicy and they'll let you try a drop of it beforehand to ask. I wasn't crazy about the texture of them however to be completely honest - I prefer my wings to be a bit more on the crunchier side and fully cooked. As far as sides - the fried gouda bites are heavenly! Try dipping them in the wing sauce for a next level experience. Note - these are nothing like cheese curds if that's what you're expecting. I don't know if this was worth the drive all the way from where we were staying on the strip. But if you're in the area - it certainly wouldn't hurt giving them a try. The spot's a bit divey and located inside of Shooters. There's also no wait service so be ready to clean up after yourself!"}
{"text":"Did some usual research for a great wing spot and ended up here. Let me save you the researching trouble:  Come here and enjoy some of the many different flavors they have (like 80). The wings are absolutely delicious, the pigs wings SO good too. I pared these with a Hot Tennessee BBQ and I suggest you do the same. Fried pickles? Yes. Also amazing. Dessert? Naturally. Cobbler. You have to order this."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Staff super friendly and knowledgeable took the time to explain the 100 different flavors. The Pig wings are a most try!! Great place for live Reggae music! Food is by the pound, each pound is a different flavor. Dessert menu is great as well! Add this place to your favorite spots to eat!"}
{"text":"The ambience. The food. The vibes. The Owners.  THIS place is where it's AT!!!! Do yourself a favor and drive here to try one of their 100 flavors of sauces. The dishes were served and I felt like i was in the Bellagio paying for a $100 meal. The decor and location are awesome. Easy access next to the 215. Aside from the wings, the spinach stuffed Portobello mushroom was to die for. I'm so impressed and will be back often! Kudos to the Peace family."}
{"text":"These really are the BEST wings in town!! They just moved locations from the east side to the nice side of town. They have the most amazing sauce and their staff really makes the experience!! Britney goes above and beyond for every single person that comes in and you can see that she genuinely cares. They wings MAN OH MAN I always get lemon pepper mild (wet) and it is the most tastiest thing of all time, their fries are SOO good and crusty yet soft inside it's all about the batter!! Hands down best wings I've ever had blows BWW out of the water!!"}
{"text":"Although I had bookmarked this place, I didn't realize it would be in the same building as Kaba Curry, so finding it when I attended my first Elite event was a double bonus of amazing flavors in one night! The gentlemen behind the counter were very welcoming and attentive, and were nice enough to treat us to some of their chill and parmesan fries (amazing, btw), which was enough to get me curious about their wings.  Once I decided to get a few wings to try I approached the counter and asked the million dollar question: \"what is your best seller?\" I thought I would get a standard pitch for some random flavor, but the owner (I didn't catch his name) let me sample different sauces and even tweaked one of the sauce recipes just for me! I will undoubtedly come back to get some of the dry-rubbed wings which, if they are as amazing as the jamaican jerk ones, should be pretty amazing.  Thanks guys for your great service and awesome wings. You just became my favorite wing spot in town!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time based off the reviews. Walking in there at 6:30 on a Saturday I was surprised it was empty. My husband and I ordered 3lbs of wings (7 wings per lbs minimum, which was stated on the menu) and a small fry. The wait for the food was not long at all, which was awesome. They gave us exactly 7 wings per pound even though it seemed way less then 3 lbs but whatever. The Jamaican spice sauce was amazing. The cool ranch was ok and same with the medium nothing special. The wings were cooked well. Now as the fries, they were terrible. They lacked salt and flavor all around. The ranch was great. I also got a peach cobbler thingy for checking in, you could taste the grease that it was cooked in (same as the wings). All in all I'll go back for the wings only possibly."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Amazing service.  Amazing prices.  Don't hesitate.     Julia is Awesome. Her son owns the place.    I had a full pound of wings and a full pound of chicken strips."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I must say they were probably some of the best wings I've had. I didn't know it was a Jamaican theme until I got here but I loved every bit of it. The place has a great atmosphere with great music and great staff. Everyone was so nice and service was always timely. It is kind of pricey but definitely worth it. The wings go by pound and there's about 10-12 wings a pound I THINK if I remember correctly. But the wings are HUGE so they definitely fill you up I think I had like 4 and was already full. We also got fries and they were amazing Idk how or what they cook them with but they were very good. I tried the Jamaican jerk sauce I believe or something along those lines under the medium category and it very good. You can ask to taste the sauces and they'll bring out a little bit of each. Overall highly recommend this place everything was great. Oh! And I was also told that they have live reggae shows every so often that are family friendly so that's pretty cool too!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Tien for introducing us to this place. I would've never known about this place. Always in search of good wings, and to find great French fries in the same search is phenomenal. The owners are from Louisiana so they know good food and are friendly as well.  We got to sample some of their Slam sauces, Sweet Chili fries, garlic Parmesan fries, fried pickle chips and peach cobbler. We ended up ordering some Jerk Slam wings. Nice size wings, cooked perfectly and the price is great. They don't skimp on the sauce either.  I can't wait to go back and try more of their many flavor wings and fries."}
{"text":"We were a group of six and all orders were brought out separately.  Was advised only one waffle maker in the restaurant. Small waffle slider brought out and the large waffle order brought out about 10 minutes later ( who does this ).  My garden salad had old tomatoes that they covered in Parmesan cheese to hide their state of nearing rotten status. Wish there was a separate review for the waitress, she was awesome."}
{"text":"Saw the sign. Decided to go to dinner there. The menu looked pretty good. We ordered an appetizer and our meal.   It took 52 minutes to receive any food at all. The child's meal we ordered came first. We then reminded the waitress about our appetizer. Never put in. We had no silverware or napkins. When our meal did arrive,They also forgot our fries.   The music is not background music. It is too loud. You cannot hear the staff or the people you are there with.   At this point, I suppose I could stop and not describe the food that was received. But I won't.   Chicken wings: Cold to the touch. (I guess they were done earlier than the 52 minutes it took to get them to our table.   Fries:  Soggy and tasteless.  Guda bites: The high point. However the Ranch dressing was very, very thin.   The positive, was the sign out front. Very well lit and nicely designed. It is too bad the new business that moves in after this business fails will not be able to use it."}
{"text":"We went yesterday (Saturday) right when they opened.  We ordered several different items... we were charged for ranch dressing to dip our wings in, the chicken fingers came out very dark (maybe old oil) I dunno.  I had wings with the Louisiana Dry Rub which I felt was very plain (Wing Stops) is so much better.  Asked for xtra crispy (got them regular).  We asked to taste some of the sauces since there were so many different flavors.  The waitress brought out a plate with 4 little dots on it (really).  When the check came it was all screwed up, I got charged for things that the other people with us ordered.  Waitress said the system won't allow her to \"fix it\", should have entered it in correctly to begin with (my opinion)...   Needless to say we didn't have a great experience at all...  Don't think we'll be back"}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying... these are hands down the best wings in the world! I have traveled around alot and my thing is wings and burgers and both are on point here 100%!!  80 flavors of wings and you better believe you have to try the spicy strawberry cheesecake pig wings that you dip in yogurt! It's a game changer for your mouthgasm!!   Extremely satisfied customer and will be coming back over and over and over again when im in Vegas."}
{"text":"This spot is awesome - came all the way from LA to try these wings - the environment is bad ass - especially because I'm a huge reggae music fan - definitely coming back - oh and the wings are great !!"}
{"text":"We love this place! We have passed Wing King so many times and never though about going here. Stepped in one day and immediately fell in love with the atmosphere and the friendly staff. We eaten here a few times and my husband took his cousin for lunch one day and his cousin ended up back there for dinner! Keep it up Wing King! We'll keep singing your praises!!"}
{"text":"Tricia was amazing and very helpful. The food was amazing. The wings and the kem burger tasted like heaven on a bun. It just melted in your mouth with every bit. The wings were crisp to perfection and topped with amazing seasoning."}
{"text":"I've Been to this place before and it was amazing but to far from home to become a regular  but now they are opening right next door to my store MyFit Mattress on flamingo and Fort Apache 4235 S FortApache rd. 89147 So Pumped to have these guys next door to us!!! cant wait till the GRAND OPENING!!!!!!!!!!!! #WingKing"}
{"text":"THE FOOD HERE IS TO DIE FOR!! Everything about this little joint is awesome, from the vibe to the service, but all of the food is seriously so good. Hats off to the chef(s)."}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving some wings and with a search in google Wing King came up and with a choice of 100 flavors it was no doubt we were going to head there. It has a cool Rastafarian vibe, reggae music playing in the background and great service. We had Cajun and sweet chili Jerk (I think) along with fries and Gouda bites. I was mad at myself for not asking for the wings to be well done because I ALWAYS ask for wings to be well done BUT the first bite and they were cooked to PERFECTION. The service was great and we got exactly what we were looking for! As long as I'm in Las Vegas Wing King will always have me as a customer. Next time I plan on getting my wings with Love all over!"}
{"text":"The Pig wings were so amazing!! Falling right off the bone! And so many sauces! Can't go wrong! Very friendly staff and very helping in making choices!"}
{"text":"Oh em gee! This place is amazing! Friendliest staff and a chill vibe. We walked in and were seated immediately. TVs all playing football playoffs! Wings and football?! American perfection! The menu is a little overwhelming but that's only because  they have a jillion flavor options for your wings! We tried honey BBQ traditional and kiddo got coconut spicy popcorn style (because they were out of fingers). We also got fried corn on the cob. Let's start with that-you wouldn't think it works, but it was amazing! The sauce the corn comes with is fresh and melts right into the corn. It's delish! The wings were amazing! Huge wings with lots of meat. I was able to get through 2 of them! That's it. 2! The honey BBQ sauce is the best I've had. Kiddo GRUBBED the coconut spice chicken. She loved it. She's still talking about it lol. Our waitress, Nora, was so great and all the staff was super accommodating! I can't wait to bring hubby back! Next time I'm doing salt & vinegar!"}
{"text":"How good is it when the best thing on the menu is the peach cobbler??  That's definitely worth trying above anything else.  It might be even worth buying a whole tin of it.  I would!!  I wasn't impressed with the rest of it.  We got 12 wings.  Half of it was extra hot and the other was garlic parmesan which was recommended by the person working.  It had a ton of grated (sawdust) parmesan on top which was pretty lame.  The wings were just wings.  Nothing special to me.  The baked beans side was really good and the potato salad was decent but that doesn't equal a complete dinner.  The red velvet cake wasn't as good as before either.  It was definitely dry and there were no chocolate chips in it like last time.    Considering the atmosphere of the dining area (this would be an ideal place for illegal transactions to go down) or other things lacking like clean tables AND the fact that Wing King doesn't have one of the best things to drink with wings (BEER), I am a takeout customer at best.    Call in your order if you don't like waiting."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! We had great service and it was a great environment. They let us try some of the sauces before placing our order to ensure we would be satisfied with our food. The waitress Marilyn was helpful and super nice. Food was really delicious. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best wings I've ever tried in Vegas. They also hand cut their fries and have over 100 wing flavors!! They've got something on the menu for everyone including vegetarian options! My new go to wing spot. You won't be disappointed ."}
{"text":"Yum. With 100 flavors of wings and pork wings this place is amazing. They service was super friendly and helpful, all you ask for and more. Very tasty place."}
{"text":"Ordered 4 lbs of wings, the cauliflower, and sweet potato fries for takeout.  All we very good, and the crowd was pleased.  2lbs of honey BBQ, lb of mild garlic, and lb of mild chipotle.   I will say that the mild was not so mild, and was prob more like a high medium to all of our taste buds.  But was still very good.  Glad we tried Wing King.  We will be back"}
{"text":"Huge variety and the fry plates are great for sharing with the table!  The non-wing options are great too.  Would recommend the Parmesan Chicken Sandwich!"}
{"text":"Good food good service excellent atmosphere !!! Chile lime fuzion was the best !!!! The fires were awesome !!!!!!!! Definitely will be heading back"}
{"text":"By far the best wings i've eaten, so many flavors to choose from. Once you're done with your wings, I recommend you try the peach cobbler. Why you may ask? Its to good to resist. Don't judge the place by where its located or i its a food court. To me, this place beats Buffalo Wild Wings by far. You should really try this place out and give it a try before judging it."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN, THE BEST WINGS IN VEGAS! Not only are their wings BIG and JUICY but the sauces are out of this world good!!! Mouth watering is an understatement, I don't want to wash my hand yet because my fingers have been blessed with goodness and I can't stop licking them. Oh, and the peach cobbler will have me crawling back forever. To top it all off Brittney's service was beyond Above and Beyond! I will be back, repeatedly, to try every flavor."}
{"text":"Best wings and servers in town !!!! Wings are super fresh and. To die for !!! I always come in for their wings and today they had a special on pop corn wings so I had. To try !! They're also to die for !!!"}
{"text":"Place is the place to go for wings in Vegas. 100 different flavors to choose from. Customer service was great. The pig wings are a must try and did get overwhelmed with the selection of flavors"}
{"text":"Best wings in town!! Wish I lived closer! Owners are really friendly and welcoming :) you have to try their cakes too!"}
{"text":"Everything was beyond delicious!!! You NEED to check this place out!!! Thank you Wing King for the best wings I EVER had!!! Executive Chef Joey Galeano, MagicalButter.com"}
{"text":"Love the vibe here. Great customer service! Food always on point, me and my family enjoy coming here everytine."}
{"text":"Eck! Nasty wings no fries?????? Workers getting high."}
{"text":"--- (Updated from 2 star review) -------  The owner personally messaged me to apologize and compensate for the poor experience I had. Very respectful guy. They sent me a free order of wings so I got the Jamaican Jerk I believe , Medium Buffalo wings and Spicy Mango pig wings. Buffalo wings were good, the jamaican jerk wings were awesome and the Spicy Mango pig wings were really good too, soft and juicy. This is what Wing King is all about. Id recommend anyone to try it at least twice! 4 stars solid.   ---- (previous review) ----  Unbiased review (Updated from about a month ago)  I just ordered from Wing King, got it delivered because I came to visit a friend here in Las Vegas. We got the Spicy Garlic Parmesan, Medium Wings and Spicy Mesquite BBQ PW (Pig Wings) with fries. Wasn't blown away but I wasn't totally disappointed. The Spicy Garlic Parmesan wings, weren't spicy, and if they were seasoned for spice I didn't notice it. The Medium wings, (Medium buffalo) were ok, I actually liked these the most out of the three different flavors.  The Spicy Mesquite BBQ, was pretty bland. The Fries were okay, kinda soggy but that's kind of expected when you get delivery.  Overall okay."}
{"text":"Love this place. So many flavors too choose from, but you can never go wrong with Garlic Parmesean. Dipping sauces are extra, but I'm willing to pay a lil extra for their Parmesean Ranch sauce. Highly addictive sauce. It might as well be crack. Service is always great and very hospitable. Hands down, the BEST wings in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Best wings in town hands down! I love coming here on my day off with my family. I recommend you try one of their many amazing unique wing sauces."}
{"text":"Best Wings I've ever had. I've found my new wing place.  Went here with a group of friends, ordered the party platter and every single flavor was great.  I'm not going to tell you what to do or anything, but if you don't check out these wings, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Wing King.  King of Wings.  They have way more flavors to select from (40 at last count, if you want to get all detail oriented about it), and some I rather not try without some significant payout as part of a dare and a large glass of ice cold milk.  For me the main reason to hit up Wing King, is their desserts.  Red Velet Cake is good, but sinfully good when it is barely legal out of the oven.  If I can still eat like a teenager, I would totally eat 1/2 a cake and a pint of ice cream.    Hidden gem in the dessert category."}
{"text":"Omg so many flavors!!!  I need a menu to check them off as I go!  Definitely coming back!  Pork shanks for the first time and watermelon bbq sauce Traditional wings with garlic Parmesan was delicious!!  Tricia was awesome in helping decide!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've never received such wonderful customer service! They're awesome and not to mention the Asian fantasy are top notch and i don't even like wings! Great job wing king!"}
{"text":"Best wing place in Vegas!!! Let me just update this review since it's been a while and they've moved locations. This place became my 2x a week place to eat. Brittany the owner is a incredible person, loving, kind and just makes you smile the minute she talks to you. Everything about the new place feels so homey, very comfortable seating, nice jams to listen to, very family oriented. Any concern or issue(which is never) Brittany strives to her best to accommodate you. I kid you not I love these wings, Iv tried multiple places after they closed for a month to relocate and I was disappointed every single time. My favorite is the teriyaki BBQ, my wife gets the wet lemon pepper which is also amazing. Iv tried multiple flavors from hot to mild, normally im a spicy hot lover when it comes to the boneless wings, but for traditional i like the BBQ. Also they updated he pizza and my kid ate even the crust!! And he's 4, idk about you but when I was young I hated the crust lol. But seriously if you live out here don't pass this place up. They Also have CBD they fuse into the wings, not my cup of tea but it's definitely something unoriginal that you won't find anywhere in a different wing place. They are just getting up and running about 3 days ago and they are already killing it.   If you are a BBQ guy/girl go for the teriyaki BBQ   Oh and there fries are the only fries I will ever eat again, puts to shame any ans every place out here, one of the first that actually don't taste like chemicals. Real tasting. Absolute fave. I'll order pounds of wings and fries just to re heat for the next day or two."}
{"text":"went in to try out this place since a lot of people are saying it's so good and the cashier was really rude! me and my husband were asking about the lunch special and asking how it works since we have never been their and the lady was just sitting rolling her eyes at us and not saying one word. we ended up walking out because of bad customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for wings!!! Every kind of sauce or rub you can imagine. Service was friendly and the whole vibe of the place is laid back. The fries were so good, they are coated with a little flour and sprinkled with \"magic dust\" Enjoyed the reggae music and yes we will be back"}
{"text":"Wing King has hands down the best chicken wings I've ever had in my life and PIG WINGS which I never had before and they're my new favorite. So many flavors to choose from, but ask for a recommendation and they'll help you out. The staff is awesome and super friendly.   Also, they have awesome nationally touring reggae bands pretty much every weekend. Great live music and amazing wings... and get a veggie kabob too, they're dank. And if you like waffles, dude... wow, epic. Great drink specials... This place is like heaven.  If you want to get off the strip and go to someplace that's not going to break the bank and you're going to have amazing food and great entertainment, Wing King is where it's at!!!   But, if you're on the strip and you want wings... Wing King delivers too... How awesome is that?"}
