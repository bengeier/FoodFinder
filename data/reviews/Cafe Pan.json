{"text":"I got there after 9:00 AM and waffles and crepes weren't available (which seems like 1/3 of their menu).  Disappointing.  Omelette with sides were alright but nothing special.  They wanted to charge me .75 for a cup of ice.  Just not impressed and won't return.  I also couldn't charge the food to my Venetian room, which might be the case for all the food court restaurants."}
{"text":"Have never seen a slower fast food. Should be called slow food. Employees have no clue what they are doing and hardly understand any English. Pathetic for a 5 star Venetian luxury hotel!!"}
{"text":"Worst looking lox and bagel plate ever! They had to borrow onions from another restaurant. Granted it is in a food court but it is in the Venetian. I don't think they have ever eaten lox and bagels themselves before.  They didn't offer to take it back or replace it or anything. Bad customer service. Customer is always right guys.  The taste was okay but for $11.25, I expected better looking lox. Just fatty and pale, not lean and pink like lox should look. I'll never complain about Einstein's again!"}
{"text":"The food is horrible, do not waste your money here. I had the chocolate crepes and by far this is the worst crepes I ever eaten. It was so dry and not good at all. My friend ordered the breakfast combo, the egg was dry, the pancake was bland and dry, the hashbrown was dry. Basically everything we had was dry except for the coffee."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service , expensive , everything is money money money I have no wonder why they got just only two star review from all estimate lmao"}
{"text":"I had the blueberry scone, I thought about getting the Nutella banana waffle but decided it was too late for so much sweetness. The scone was a nice size, but it didn't have many blueberries in it. My fiancé was not impressed at all, he thought it was too dry. I would have given it a 4, he said a 2, so i gave them a 3."}
{"text":"Maybe I got the wrong item, but the salad was one of the worst I ever had. I ordered a Mediterranean salad with chicken and received a salad and some chopped vegetables that tasted like they had straight lemon juice poured on them, no flavor or seasoning. The processed chicken resembled strips of styrofoam and was flavored similarly. All this for about $15 and I had to throw it away after a few bites. Yuck."}
{"text":"Completely chaotic ordering system. If you order two different types of foods as crepes and omelette then be prepared for one item to be cold by the time the other is made. Poor service as they could not take not understand requests"}
{"text":"This is the most unfriendly place in Venetian Hotel. Just hate seeing such a grumpy staff early in the morning. My waffle was okay. Nothing great. I would not go back."}
{"text":"Bought a Gelato 1 flavor which on the menu board shows a waffle cone with a scope of gelato in letters right under the cone says \"1 flavor $4.95\".  At the register you are charged $1.00 extra for the cone. WHAT A RIPOFF!! If you charge more for something other than what the menu board says you are intentionally misleading customers.  Manager didn't care and said that's what they charge. Oh ya, notice the 1 flavor also shows two scoops on the cone...ours came with 1!!"}
{"text":"This place in the Venetian has the worst service ever! If the kids weren't with me, I left already.  We were next in line, the old woman ignore us even after I told her we are next.  People coming in after us get their service before us.  WTH!"}
{"text":"They simultaneously burned the pancakes and left them raw inside (how??) and then rolled their eyes when we asked for our money back in lieu of having them recook. They also burnt the omelettes (which were also salty af).   Do yourself a favor and stick to the Subway or the Panda Express in this food court."}
{"text":"I came here twice during my trip to Vegas and was not phased by this place, but I honestly did not expect much to begin with. First time I got coffee, a donut, and a strawberry waffle. I absolutely did not like the donut whatsoever. I came here around 11ish so I expected the donut to be at least somewhat fresh but it was hard as a rock and the dough was tasteless with a lot of cream-filled filling. I literally felt like I was eating just sugar, not a cream. The waffle was rather bland, but thank goodness they gave me a lot of strawberries and strawberry jam, so that was good. Nothing spectacular. Then I ordered their chicken shawarma and it was actually pretty good for $11. The portions are pretty big. Half salad half rice/shawarma and a scoop of hummus. I would defintely order that again when I come back."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Crazy rules about coffee cups. Takes forever to get food. Pastries meh.   So I wanted a small coffee in a one size up cup. Or even just an empty cup. I brought my own almond milk and I can't drink coffee that strong black without stomach problems. So the woman was first confused. I thought nothing of it. We got our buzzer. No coffee even though all the coffee fixings are by the register. We waited 15 minutes to get anything. Coffee was full. So I looked at the receipt - I was charged for a large coffee. Asked and was told I had to either pay $1.50 for an empty cup or deal with it. I ended up paying 50cents to pour coffee into the trash can.   Pastry was meh at best. Crepe seemed fine.   Go to grand lux cafe instead."}
{"text":"Food here is as bad as their customer service. There are better places around for coffee and breakfast People who work here don't understand English and I am ok with that. They can atlesst be polite not rude... If they don't understand, it is not my effing problem...  I would give them a 0 if at all possible"}
{"text":"Cold latte for $5.75! We ordered simple sandwiches (no meat) for 2. Total bill was $28.06. Would have been better to go next door for breakfast buffet that is delicious and total cost for two was $50."}
{"text":"Okay so this was an awesome find.  *NOTE: It's kind of hard to find..it's in the Venetian Casino Food Court on the first floor*  We had the lox bagel, banana and chocolate crepe (amazing), and bacon, egg and cheese crossiant. So good! And cafe au lait and chai tea were great. Everything totaled out to about $48..which is cheap compared to everywhere else I ate in Vegas (including the $25 hamburgers).  When I'm in Vegas, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Avoid. Horrible service. Inconsistent crepes. Day old Krispy Kreme. Average coffee. Did I mention horrible service? Both locations in the Venetian are this way, although the one next to the casino is worse. Unfriendly workers are kind of shockingly antisocial. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid. Go to Bouchon instead. I wish I had."}
{"text":"Food was blah, service was kinda rude. They messed up my order.  Way better options to eat within 50 feet."}
{"text":"You know, the first time we ate here, about 5 months ago, we thought we found the greatest non-chain food court option on the whole Strip. So today, my family and I decided to to grab shawarma before hitting the road back to Southern California. Answer me this: who starts lunch service at 1:30pm?! You read that right... 1:30pm. We arrived at 12:30pm, after having checked out of our hotel, and were told lunch would not start for at least another hour because they are still serving breakfast?? And who else in the food court is still serving breakfast at 12:30pm? Nobody. What a waste of time. I don't care how good I remember that shawarma being because I'll never spend another penny at a place that prioritized getting rid of their breakfast foods on their line before serving the next menu at the proper time. Customer service means nothing to them but everything in this city."}
{"text":"Do not go here for Breakfast. They over charge. I spent $38.00 for food and when I asked for extra syrup they said it was 75¢ a packet. The hash browns were frozen ones and they charge $2.00 extra. $3 for bottled water. They won't give tap. $3.00 for orange juice. Food was poor and you can get more bang for your buck in other places."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I get the waffles with fruit or nutella and bananas. It's in a real casual food court on the casino floor so it's not hard to find. They have just about a little of everything but they're known for their crepes, gelato and what I usually get is the waffles. The employees are cool the prices are a little high but this is Vegas so that's to be expected. Also just about every place you go to they have a tip jar so make sure you tip. Pan is nothing fancy but they have some sweets and who doesn't love sweets ?"}
{"text":"DON'T EAT HERE!!  I can't believe the Venetian allows this place to rent space!  Everything we got was horrible!  The hummus had an acid-y taste which means it was old. The chicken was dry and bad tasting and the rice was mushy!  Yuck!!"}
{"text":"The coffee at this place was good, but everything else was pretty crappy.  Terrible customer service and poor food quality.  I watched one of the cooks burn another customer's omelette (and fortunately it wasn't my order). She looked around to see if anyone noticed and quickly flipped the burnt eggs over on his plate instead of making new food. What a terrible thing to do.  I was chuckling to myself too soon... my egg, bacon, and cheese croissant was not any better... could barely see the egg and shriveled up bacon.   Their overall also attitude sucked.  Asked for an extra plate to share my wife's crepe and they made it seem like I was asking for a kidney.  If you lost all of your money gambling, this place is good for a cheap alternative to expensive dining at the Venetian.  Otherwise, I recommend staying away!"}
{"text":"For some reason the cashier had to look at receipts for 5 minutes before taking each customer's order which made the lines ridiculously long.  I waited for about 10 minutes before my waffle was done and it literally just sat there along with 3 other finished orders. They didn't call out my order and so I had to get the attention of one of the workers and point out to them that my order is finished.   I ordered a mixed berry Belgian waffle and it came out floppy and a bit soggy. This is not what a Belgian waffle should taste like. The worker that made it looked at it as if she just made the worst waffle in the world and two other workers came over and looked it at the same way, but they decided to still serve it to me. I could have made a better one at my college's dining hall.   Overall, bad service and bad waffle."}
{"text":"Despite seeing mixed reviews, I had a wonderful experience. But please note, I only purchased the Gelato, therefore I cannot share any feedback on the food. Employee that served me seemed to be a trainee. May have been a manager or the owner shadowing him the entire time. After sampling 4 flavored of gelato, I began to worry I would be irritating the staff. That certainly wasn't the case. The manager or owner even joked about me trying so many flavors and certainly didn't skimp out on the sample scoops. In fact, the last sample scoop was the largest serving. I was with some family members and they were sampling flavors too. In the end, we all bought gelato, experienced very very friendly service despite having sampled quite a few flavors, and I even placed a tip in the tip jar to express my gratitude. We found this place to be cheaper than the other gelato shop inside the Venetian. Friendlier service also. Highly recommend getting gelato here."}
{"text":"They serve illy coffee here. That was the reason I got my breakfast here. Other reason could be I didn't want to walk and check in the heat. It was mid September, though hot in Vegas. This one is a cafeteria in a many food joints together. My illy was not memorable..."}
{"text":"This place pissed me off. I wish I checked Yelp ratings before coming here.   I was stuck in meetings all day until 10pm at the Venetian. All I wanted was to eat as quick as possible, since I really hate going to bed full/bloated. I was gonna order a wrap from Chicken Now, but they took too long to ask me what I wanted to order so I moved on. I saw that Cafe Pan had Mediterranean pita wraps which sounded relatively light/healthy ish to me, so I ordered a Tropicana Juice and a chicken pita wrap with spicy hummus.  The Tropicana juice was expired...Right now is January 2016 and the juice went bad in October 2015. I asked for another one, and they couldn't even find any for me because the rest were all expired too. Wtf!!! Gross! I already paid for the juice, so they offered me a Naked juice instead. The guy packing up my togo order handed me my bag and I took off since I was in a rush.   During my meal, I realized they didn't even put the Naked juice inside my bag. ;ALSKDJF;ASLDKFJ I was so thirsty and REALLY didn't want to go downstairs again...Super annoyed. Then I noticed my chicken was PINK INSIDE!!! Holy shit. This was the worst meal ever. I ended up having to just eat the lettuce and pita bread since I didn't want to risk getting salmonella while traveling for work. #sadlife"}
{"text":"TRASH! Do not eat here. Horrible food. Bought two breakfast croissants. The egg is not egg. It's some kind off experiment. The sausage wasn't cooked all the way. The guy was rude as hell. See my pic entitled \"what a joke\"."}
{"text":"When you order a crepe,  with the cook making them in front of you,  you don't expect to have an old crepe brought out of a refrigerator and heated up in front of your eyes.   Especially when you're paying $12 for the priviledge.  Thankfully the fault was rectified,  but the principal of the matter is downright shameful."}
{"text":"Ordered a beef shawarma and it did not taste good.  Meat was just cooked on the grill.  No taste. Asked to exchange with chicken and it tasted raw"}
{"text":"Horrible employees, missing the most important thing....a smile. Been there three times already hoping each time I would get a smile, and every employee we encountered had a (I hate being here) look. None of them showed any smiles at all, a major sign of baaaad management! Today's (non-smiling), almost (non-talking) employee was pissed-off Carlos!"}
{"text":"Food was bland. Small portions. No dressing for the salad. No bread for the hummus. Service was slow and they did not care if you were standing and waiting for them while they did other stuff and not helping anyone.  Eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Crappy service, SUPER overpriced, bad gelato, OK breakfast croissants (nothing special). It was $3.00 to add juice and coffee but $3.50 for ONLY juice, what?! And they're very rude. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Greedy  owner. The store will receive more money. Look out. Orange juice is $ 3.00. You will be pay 50 cents more."}
{"text":"Don't order the Salmon. Our dream anniversary was destroyed by food poisoning from a salmon crepe. I was sick for four days. Called the manger but she never returned our call. They didn't seem to care at all. Run away. We noticed they handle the fish and then put hands directly into topping bowls without changing gloves. Ugh"}
{"text":"Fast, decent crepes but pretty expensive for what you get. It's about $12-13 per crepe. The waffles are pretty good though.   In general, it's okay for a quick breakfast but not the greatest value."}
{"text":"This place is decent. It's not super gourmet food nor is it super cheap, but it's one of the cheaper options in this area around the Strip, and there is plenty of seating in the food court here at the Grand Canal Shoppes.  I got the ham and cheese crepe and the mixed berry crepe. The ham and cheese one wasn't that good in my opinion. I think it was because the crepe looked or tasted like whole wheat which I'm not a fan of. They also had pesto in the crepe, and I'm a bit neutral towards that flavor.  The mixed berry was topped with plenty of fruits though. The inside of the crepe had jam though (not my thing) and nutella (definitely my thing), but I thought it was overall ok.  They also charged $0.23 for a really small cup of water, which I was not aware of until after I paid."}
{"text":"My first meal in Vegas, and I was pretty stoked to try the food here. I was staying at the Paris Hotel, so my friends and I decided to try out this place for brunch.  Appearance: The place looked promising as people were in line for the food, and it looked cool since you can see the people make the crepes behind the cashier as you were ordering. I really like the French decor, but I mean, all the stores looked like that in the hotel!   Food: I was extremely hungry and I always enjoyed crepes! I was excited to try savory crepes since I've only tried sweet. My boyfriend ordered the breakfast crepe and I ordered the spinach and artichoke crepe. At first, I was disappointed at my dish since it didn't look too much of a star...it had a few cherry tomatoes on top and that's it. I was only a little impressed by my boyfriend's since he did have a nice creamy gravy on top of his...but the big disappointment was that it had a sliver of an avocado. If you're paying for a $10 dish, I am expecting a hearty slice of an avocado!! My dish was not that impressive; It did taste good, but I could really just taste the cheese and the crepe. I could hardly taste the spinach and artichoke. Again, I was really expecting big slices where you can actually taste the ingredients that are mentioned. I took about 5 bites of my boyfriend's breakfast crepe and the egg was very fluffy, seasoned well, and overall delicious. Again though, you can barely taste the meat. It was hidden around in the crepe but you don't get much of it. It was just mostly egg. Although the food was just okay, I was surprised that I was pretty full so at least I paid for something that was done right.   Overall, the food did not taste bad at all. Was it worth my money? It depends. If you don't expect to get a lot of avocado and ham in your breakfast crepe or artichokes and spinach in your spinach and artichoke crepe, then yes, it will be worth. If you were like me, then no. It's not a place I would go again. Then again, it's Vegas so who knows??"}
{"text":"0 Stars. We ordered a waffle with Nutella. It wasn't anything special. Literally a plain waffle with some Nutella drizzled on it. I asked the lady at the register (after she was done counting the money she had in her hand) if they had whipping cream, she didn't respond so I finally just sat down. I had waited so long I didn't even care if the thing was dry, which it was. About 10 minutes after the waffle was done the guy motioned that he didn't have whip cream! Never going back there"}
{"text":"Rude customer service. My croissant was very well done on the top and charred on the bottom. I asked for a new one and received a side eye and a frown instead of an apology. Real pleasant start to the day. The drip coffee is good - thank goodness it's ground and brewed by a robot."}
{"text":"It's not bad But the can do better crepes are not That bad they just need to work on it later better they have to make it more but employees are very nice and have a smile it is legal to loud in here but then it's a food court"}
{"text":"My family and I, decided to grab a quick bite at the food court last night, after a long day on the strip, and although my wife picked-up some pizza at the court (which was pretty good), me, being of Mediterranean descent, decided to go for a gyro.  They didn't have any lamb, so against my better judgement, ordered the shawarma.  I have to tell you, I absolutely NEVER write reviews, however in this case, I quickly determined it was my duty to do whatever I could to prevent others from experiencing what I had, the absolute worst meal of my life!.....and this is coming from a guy that has traveled the world, eating unimaginable things.  The pita tasted like cardboard (I know....remember the unimaginable things I've eaten), the hummus had no flavor, the rice, OMG, what the $#@$/# was that, disgusting!!!!!......the tzatziki sauce was so watery, the beef, here again, OMG, what the $#@$!!!!  Honestly, the lettuce was the best part of the meal.  Do yourself a favor, and DON'T eat at Cafe Pan.....It'll be the best decision of your day!"}
{"text":"Schlechtester und zugleich teuerster Crêpe unseres Lebens. Wir hatten einen Crêpe Nutella Banana für 11$ Nie wieder"}
{"text":"The service here is horrible and the food is mediocre at best! Took half an hour to get a reheated piece of pizza and two warm sodas."}
{"text":"cashiers don't smile, bad service. after my order i said thank you, twice, but no answer back so i said your welcome back to myself. very rude"}
{"text":"THE VENETIAN NEEDS TO CLOSE THIS PLACE DOWN.   The first day of our trip we just walked by to look at the menu and to see if they had soup because that's what I was craving. When I asked the lady at the cashier, she wasnt listening and yelled \"WHAT DO YOU WANT\".  Uh hello, who let you work the register you rude piece o sh**. If you hate your job cool, but don't take out on other people.  Today we came for breakfast because we wanted a quick meal that was close by. I ordered a combo with egg, sausage, French toast, \"hash browns\" and a naked juice.  1) all the cooks, women, look confused as hell.  1.5) they gave us a buzzer to let us know when our order was ready, yet they still shout at us to tell us our food is ready. 2) our food came, but out of order.  3) they don't give you your drink till you get the food.  4) I changed my mind and asked for a lemonade which is $1.50 cheaper, didn't even offer me a refund but just let me know I paid more.  he said let me know what else he could get for me... my $1.50 would be nice. 5) THE FOOD WAS HORRIBLE. The hash brown patty was cold and not cooked thoroughly. I didn't bother with the French toast it looked undercooked.  Seriously a frozen meal that they threw on the grill for 1.5 seconds   I hope everyone here dies, how could you serve ppl such garbage. Please die."}
{"text":"Terrible service and tasteleas food. Stay away.   First of the would not give a glass of water - only sell you a bottle for 3 dollars!   Then I dared to want a bagel and cream cheese with a side of egg. Since they don't have a thing exactly like that I ordered the egg&cheese bagel, without the bacon and with cream cheese instead.  The lady confirmed this order, I mean they have both eggs and cream cheese so it shouldn't be a problem.   But when I got my food, there was no cream cheese. Mind you, the bagel was also stale and the egg tasteless.   Ok so no cream cheese, could be an honest mistake. I went to ask for some cream cheese, but at this the manager got really angry at me!  Eventually he agreed to sell me a tiny pack of cream cheese for $1.08. I told him that if they asked me in the first place I would have added no problem but now I've already paid and did not get what I paid for!   So like I said, extremely rude and cheap behavior, not the kind of experience I'd like to start my morning with."}
{"text":"Unbelievably bad service.  Usually check yelp and didn't this time my bad.    Like others had mentioned front lady is unpleasant. Fryer wasnt working so they offered extra soggy salad.   Worse part it took 15 minutes nobody waiting and staff standing around.     Wrap average.  Just shame Venetian doesn't have QC for food court"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They offered friendly service with a smile while giving me a great deal on food.  When deciding on what I wanted to eat at the Shops in the Venetian, it was quite a quandary. There were so many options to consider. I tried the Japanese place the night before and was disappointed in the food and service. So, I decided to try something else.  Cafe Pan seemed to have the nicest set up. Although the menu was wrong on one point (they don't have gyro), the food and service were terrific. I was greeted with a smile by the cashier and she helped me decide on what I wanted to get. She also offered many options to make my meal customized for me!  The wait wasn't too bad, but when my food arrived I was pleasantly surprised by the hefty portions. I ordered a beef shawarma with a side of fries. It was delicious. The beef was well seasoned and meshed well with the cucumber yogurt sauce and hummus. The fries were also cooked to perfection.  I was so satisfied by the food and service, I decided to get some coffee to go. One of the workers was on it! She brewed for me a delicious cup of coffee that could have cost me $5 at one of the cafes in the mall. It was half the cost and made with the same Illy brand of coffee at the fancier cafes. It was well made! There was no need for creamer or sugar.  Overall, a great experience for half the cost I would have had to pay at an expensive restaurant. Definitely returning when I am on a budget in Vegas."}
{"text":"They were out of Belgian waffles (mix?) by 11am on a Saturday morning, so we settled for the the crepes:  Mixed berry crepe - too much of the strawberry jam filling which made the crispy crepe skin soggy, while there wasn't as much fresh fruit inside and on top. Arrangement is a bit slapped together for a $12 dessert crepe.  Chicken pesto crepe - pretty tasty! There's plenty of chicken and the pesto went really well with the crepe skin. Definitely worth ordering again as the chicken breast was very moist.  Service is like a fast food place. The cashier seemed a bit confused with my question, and right after ordering, she started speaking to another cashier in a different language while still helping us, even though both of them spoke English. Definitely felt a bit awkward... Standing there while she rang us up."}
{"text":"Isn't it annoying to pay $40 for breakfast on the strip and get some lame eggs and soggy toast? We thought so, so we searched around for something good and we finally found it at Cafe Pan. The breakfast food here is very good and the price is a tiny bit high but worth it in comparison to other places we tried.   Its a little difficult to find since you need to weave your way through the mall but once you do, you're set!"}
{"text":"Located in the food court off the casino floor of the Venetian.  Offering the perfect mix of gelato, crepes, and coffee.  You can make your sweet tooth happy at this little food stall.  I stopped in for dessert tonight, but will try them for breakfast next time!  Nice selection of gelato including my favorites mango and coconut! Very creamy, the coconut gelato  actually has shredded coconut inside!  $7 for 2 scoops in a cup.  Not too bad in the new Vegas.  The smell of fresh crepes is awesome with both sweet and savory option available. Will update this review next time after I try them.  Plus your favorite espresso based coffee drinks are available.  They are in the same location as Cocolini but have changed the name.  4 out of 5 stars...will update after my next visit"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm. Possibly the best espresso I've had outside of Europe. I went back later for gelato, and that was incredible, as well. My lesson for this Vegas trip: You don't need to go to an expensive, sit down restaurant to have a good foodie experience in Vegas."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an iced caramel macchiato. Lady wasn't the friendliest. Drink was okay."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and they nickel and dime you for every extra. $.75 for extra friggin syrup to go with the French toast.  Never again."}
{"text":"I only stopped here once and it was for some fancy chocolate gelato. It was delicious. Service was friendly and fast. I am a happy customer :)"}
{"text":"I give it one star because I can't give zero. We only ordered an espresso and a cappucino which were fine, so I am not commenting on the food. The customer service is horrible! The employees were very rude. I'm sorry that we did not know the procedure of where to go to pick up our coffee because we had not been there before, but sheesh...is it so hard to answer our questions and smile and be polite? We had some questions about making it a skinny cappucino and the lady taking our order acted like we were interrupting her. We're staying at the Venetian, but we won't be buying anything else from this place!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've experienced in Vegas. Took 3 mins and us saying \"excuse me\" for them to even acknowledge us. 10 mins and some eye rolls later, they gave us our decent gelato. This place is nottttt up to Venetian standards."}
{"text":"I read the bad Yelp reviews after I already ordered so I was stuck with my purchase. I didn't think it would be as bad as everyone says but it was. I ordered a prosciutto sandwich but ended up getting a ham and cheese sandwich and it was nothing like it was described on the menu. Ingredients are cheap."}
{"text":"This place is OK at best and not what you would expect at the Venetian.  I'm sorry but Vegas is supposed to be an experience, and the Venetian should be a little bit of Europe in Vegas.  Got a ham egg and cheese breakfast crepe.  Crepe was a little doughy and they used mayo and pesto instead of Bachamel which made the whole thing greasy.  Flavor was decent, but it was too greasy to finish.  Ordering process also seems a little rough.  Nothing terrible, but not up to Venetian standards.  Pesto was also not super fresh.  At most of the better hotels here they have a very good pastry shop with crepes or a dedicated creperie.  Venetian is lacking here."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has so many negative reviews. We just ate here and we thought the food was great. Very tasty and flavorful and decent amount of food. Two of us shared the beef shawarma with rice, spicy sauce which was pretty spicy to me and a nice salad. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"Stingy people. I ordered a combo special, 3 donuts, breakfast sandwich, 3 pancakes, 2 coffees and it came out to $45.  I asked for 3 cups of water and they charged 25 cents each. I asked for an extra plate and they gave me a tiny plate I was surprised that she didn't charge me for it. McDonalds food tastes much better than this place.  Food quality isn't very good.  Hash browns were frozen kind. Only thing that was good was the coffee. Go someplace else."}
{"text":"SHITTY ASS CUSTOMER SERVICE!  This was my 2nd time trying Cafe Pan. I ordered the beef shawarma and waited about 5 minutes to get my food. They gave me a chicken shawarma plate. I quickly told them they got my order wrong and the lady was arguing with me that I got chicken.   First of all, I don't really eat chicken. So why would I order chicken shawarma? She clearly heard me wrong and mistaken my order. This lady was laughing when she was arguing with me too. RUDE AF! You deserve to be put on blast on yelp for your shitty ass customer service. Also get your ears checked out, because apparently this place makes a lot of wrong orders.  What got me really mad was that they didn't want to fix my order. She kept insisting I got chicken and didn't change my order. She literally walked off when I asked them to change it. What kind of customer service is this? I had to tell a different lady about it and then she swapped out the chicken for beef. The beef was burnt, the salad was wrinkled, and the hummus was sour (an indication of old food). My meal wasn't even edible at this point. I should of got my money back. This is ridiculous for customer service at a high end hotel.   Like everyone said on yelp, this place needs to close down ASAP."}
{"text":"Awful place. Extremely rude people. Cheap, too. Won't serve a glass of water, got our order wrong then had the nerve to ask for extra money for the actual topping we ordered."}
{"text":"Cafe Pan just screams out \"three stars.\"  I just needed a quick breakfast and found Cafe Pan due to the previous yelp review. Pretty average place...  I love omelets and Cafe Pan boasts an omelet station with a decent selection of fillings. You first choose an egg base (whole, egg substitute, egg white) and then choose any combination of fillings plus a cheese. The fillings include your typical ham, tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, onions, and some weird options such as pineapple. I opted for a tomato, ham, spinach, and onion.   It was filling and I enjoyed the hearty chunks of tomato, but the quality was average. That hash brown looked previously frozen and the toast was just alright. Pretty steep for $9 but then again this is vegas..."}
{"text":"This place sees a long queue for breakfast in the morning. But the taste of its food falls short. We ordered bagels, orange juice and berry pie for brunch. The bagel was hard, chewy and kind of stale. The orange juice was nothing but Tropicana poured in a plastic cup. The only good thing was that Berry pie that looked inviting n tasted well too."}
{"text":"Bought bagel with cream chess and bagel with ham and cheese. Bagel was over burnt. It was really hard to eat. I would recommend don't try their bagels."}
{"text":"Cashier looks mean and has no customer service but she did give me water.  Beef schwarma plate was plenty of food but nothing had flavor.  The hummus, tzaki sauce, rice, and meat all lacked taste.  Too bad, it could have been delicious!  Portions are huge for the price.  I noticed they had 2 locations in the Venetian.  This review is for the one next to Panda express."}
{"text":"Stay away.  Ordered crepes and 15 minutes later they say they made a mistake and are not making it.      I agree with other posters that the Venetian ought to shut this place down."}
{"text":"I came here for gelato and it was wonderful!  I ordered the small, two flavors of Salted Caramel and Pistachio.    This place is located on the main casino floor of The Venetian.  It is near other food places, almost like a food court and plenty of seating available.  There are MANY restaurants and coffee shops to eat at..."}
{"text":"Awful customer service. All the workers are rude about everything.  I got a bagel with cream cheese. The bagel was hard as a rock and the cream cheese was expired."}
{"text":"This place is a rip off.   Latte shows 4.65 (one price) on price list.  I ordered 16 oz.   I did not expect to be charged additional $ 1.25.   They should have lost it on their menu but not try to trick customers.  Even if I order one size up.  I am expecting perhaps 50 cents increase not 1.25."}
{"text":"Worst customer service the cashier older man receipt said his name was Carlos was so rude be messed up our order and when I pointed it out to him he gave me an attitude and didn't want to fix it even tough they hadn't even started making my order yet. Food was blah got a breakfast sandwich but next time will just stick to one of the other places around where for around the same price you get and actual breakfast plate."}
{"text":"Worst food ever. Zero stars if I could. The chicken was dry and not enough sauce in the pita. The beef gyro was the worst I've ever had. Beef was chewy, fatty and tasteless. Can I get my $ back?"}
{"text":"Had a very bad experience here. They charged us 25 cents for a cup of water when panda express will give you one for free.  It was our first time eating at this place and we definetly wouldn't recommend it to anybody else. The tabouli was only offered to us for free because it was old and smelly.  The only thing that was decent was their rice and hummus. The meat wasn't even cooked properly."}
{"text":"Employees are the biggest a-holes I ever dealt with. I was about to try this place for dessert, but because of their rude attitudes, I walked away. I asked for an extra coffee cup so i can share the coffee with my mother and the stupid rude employee told me they were closing the register (at 3pm?). Ummm idiot, I asked for a cup not for coffee. Then he gives me a plastic cup. I said F it and walked away. 10 min later I see people ordering at the register. So they weren't closed.."}
{"text":"The ham and cheese croissant sandwich was a great on-the-go breakfast. Despite the line/ crowd, everyone was pleasant and orderly, and made crepes, coffees, and sandwiches with efficiency and ease. It's nice to know that my croissant sandwich was made fresh instead of just extracted from the display case and heated up. Definitely recommended for a quick pick-me-up."}
