{"text":"It was the promise of amazing music that first brought me through the doors of bassline, but it soon became apparent to me that this place was so much more than the average music bar in Toronto. 
For starters, I was immediately and warmly greeted by the owner Craig and made to feel as welcome as I could ever expect for place I was totally unfamiliar with at the time. 
Craig is a fantastic host and an even better person and as we got to talking about the quality of salt in Mexico we struck up an instant repore when it came to both music and food. 
It didn't take me long to realize that he was as passionate about cuisine as I was and I felt a touch of excitement as I ordered a the house special- the bassline Burger and Fries. The first thing I noticed about the burger before I even took a bite was the incredible presentation of the plate and the immaculate distribution of the toppings. Sandwiched between a fluffy Harbord bakery bun (which for those of you who don't know is one of Toronto's oldest and most renowned bakeries) is a massive 8 ounce beef patty made from some of the finest chuck money can buy and flavored with a well balanced blend of spices and marinades. It's then topped with fresh vegetables your choice of cheese (I chose goat) and red peppers; the end result was perhaps the finest burger I have ever tasted at a restaurant. 
Accompanying the burger were some of the most perfectly golden brown fries I'd ever seen, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, perfect texture, absolutely loved the yellow flesh potatoes as well, not sure why more places don't use them. 
Bassline is also a really cool place to hang, the stage is visible from every point in  the club, the decor and atmosphere is fantastic and the musical acts that play there are on the cutting edge of Toronto's vibrant and underrated live music scene. 
Check this place out regardless of what area you live in, it's worth the trek!"}
{"text":"I had the best time here! The owner and all the staff were super friendly and welcoming, the beats were dope, and the overall vibe was great. Everyone on the dance floor was having a great time, but if you needed to take a break from dancing, the music at the front of the bar wasn't so loud that you couldn't enjoy having a conversation. 

This place was perfect and I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Best bar experience I've ever had!
First off, they have a special going on right now where all drinks are $5 before 11pm. The bar service was amazing! The bartender was able to suggest the perfect drinks for me based on the flavours I told her I was craving. She knew what she was doing, was friendly and unpretentious. The owner is also incredibly friendly.
They also have a Supernintendo hooked up to the bar TVs (only one player though) which is super awesome.
It was a rainy night so the bar wasn't crowded -- perfect in my opinion. The music was great, I was able to groove out to it but still have a conversation. 
I definitely intend on coming back here and trying out their burger.
Amazing vibe, service, drinks and prices."}
{"text":"Most underrated lounge for house and deep house (Might even be the ONLY place for it). Been here multiple times, the owner, Craig, is super friendly, as are all the patrons. You can strike up a conversation easily with just about anyone. 

Sometimes there is a cover charge of $5 after 9 pm. But definitely worth it for this place. There is a dance floor and a few tables and chairs. But great atmosphere just for chilling and hanging out."}
{"text":"This place was the existential climax to a night of pure ecstasy which started off by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of different film speeds. I was in the midst of a rap battle at my friend's house between me and Robin Thicke's estranged brother when it was decided we would resume it after going dancing at Bassline. 

Someone brought out a giant bottle of what I think was apple juice, and I still think it was actually apple juice, and we set off down the street. 

It seems like a relatively straight forward bar/dance floor set up with a coat hanger for coats however I'm more the type to just throw my coat over the DJ table. That brings me to my next point definitely DO talk to the DJ because they're there for your enjoyment and any songs you can think of for them to play are greatly appreciated. Unfortunately they just didn't have any of the songs I kept requesting (about 30 in total) so I'll make sure to bring my ipod next time. 

The dancing area is good. It's dark and pretty warm. Bathroom was cold but that's to be expected when it's in the bassment. I drank a pretty gross beer but they had some decent selections available. NOTE: they do not have appletinis and will pretend they don't know what they are, so don't ask. 

Anyway I had fun and took my drunk friend home and he tried to kiss me thanks for reading."}
{"text":"I was there with my girlfriend to have a good time dancing with her....and as soon as she went to the washroom was suddenly removed using physical force (grabbing me by the neck and dragging me from behind until I passed out) and then assaulting me (hit in the face requiring five stitches on upper lip) while unconscious, just outside the front door, with no specific reason why."}
{"text":"Bassline Music Bar is another Toronto institution from what I gather, and of course, in addition to all the right chemistry, the people there are what make the difference. Everyone comments on the owner being a great guy, and they are right! He is easy going, likes a good quality sound from his DJs, is easy to talk to and adds a house party feel that is not easy to find in a big city.
The door guy was friendly, the barkeep was fantastic, and the sound system, oh my! it pumps out the beats like there's no tomorrow. People come here for one reason: to dance.
Worth checking out when you feel the urge to dance or like an upbeat atmosphere near the front of the bar."}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars or even a negative star if I could...Craig is a nice guy until you get on his bad side (seems it doesnt take much to get on his bad side). He punches people out for stepping out of his line (no way to tell what his line is. even a bit drunk will get you kicked out, sometimes dragged out, and on one occasion, chased down the back alley with a baseball bat).

I also witnessed him punch out some kid for having a seizure (he was epileptic).

Not sure why everyone loves this bar. Its tiny, dancefloor is small as f*** and sound system aint even that great.

One day, Craig will get punched back. He will punch out the wrong dude and someone might pull out a knife, who knows. But you cant run a bar successfully for too long by punching out people who dont conform to your standards (all of us who have got assaulted by this dickhead have no clue to this day why he did it. being drunk shouldnt be a reason btw. who doesnt get drunk that goes to bars for crying out friggin loud??)"}
{"text":"One of the better small clubs for electronic music in the city. Good sound and lights, and a place to hear a wide variety of strictly electronic music (you will be able to hear everything from house, techno, breaks, and beyond - but there is literally a sign in the dj booth saying no top 40 or hip hop, so don't be expecting any of that). 
I can't hate on a place that helps keep the underground vibes alive and gives promoters and upcoming dj's a place to throw smaller events, so 4 stars it is.

My only slight peeve is that they have Red Rain instead of Red Bull, and despite having multiple beer taps the last couple times I went they only had 1 they were serving from (usually a lager... how about throwing in an IPA or something as well to give some variety?). Luckily the bar staff are friendly so I've been able to look past these facts."}
{"text":"Why does this this bar have so many 4 and 5-star reviews?! I don't understand!

OK, the staff was all very friendly from the door girl ($5 cover on a Friday night) to both bartenders. Seriously, there was a total sketchy guy who wouldn't stop chatting with us and the bartender was on it. Like ON. I have a feeling they may have had problems with him before because the first time he stepped away she offered to have him leave if we wanted. At first we thought he was harmless but then he actually turned out to be creepy and annoying.

Anyway, back to the bar.... As I said, very friendly staff but the place stinks like must and old wood and it hits you like a brick wall when you walk in.

I'm gonna classify this place as a dive bar despite it's rather well-kept bathrooms (spacious, relatively clean and stocked).

The dance and DJ area in the back is small and when we were there, only 4 people were dancing. The lighting's pretty cool and could make for some fun pics to post on Instagram. As for the music, I imagine the DJs change regularly, but I wasn't feelin' it this night.

The beer selection is fair and as mentioned, staff was very attentive and friendly. They had a lot of bottles of other alcohol... The stuff used to make sweet fruity drinks. That said, I could have just been seeing double. Actually, I was probably seeing double-and maybe they just have a standard selection.

Anyway, I won't be back. There are too many other places with better music and nicer smells."}
{"text":"Big sound small room, amazing vibe night after night. I could ask for a better place to come and dance."}
{"text":"Pretty sweet dance area in the back with funky lights. It's really dark back there so you can get your grind on for sure. They have a coat rack, which means they understand we live in Toronto. Bartender was super nice and didn't have the classic bartender attitude. They get their food from this Ethiopian restaurant next door. My friend and I specifically went out for fries that night (fries before guys) so we only got those but the menu looks quite tasty and the fries were pretty standard. There's ample place to sit as long as the place isn't too packed. The host was very sweet and approachable which made us want to come back. And the decor was dope as well."}
{"text":"I love this place!

My partner and I discovered it a few months ago, and it's become one of our favourite bars in this part of the city.  

Emory (best barman ever!) is awesome; he's always remembered our names and what we like.

They make a great Harvey Wallbanger, and their Skittle Shots are made in-house and very tasty.  There are also a lot of great specials - some of the best values I've found in the neighbourhood.

One of the owners, Craig, is a gem. He is always friendly and willing to help - he always comes by and says hello.  And they play great music!

I would recommend BassLine to anyone's who's looking for something chill, friendly and free of pretension (Hi, Pistol).  It's exactly what this neighbourhood needs."}
