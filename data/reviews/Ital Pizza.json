{"text":"A co-worker introduced me to this little gem!  The chicken is amazing but the cod (Bacalhau) is to DIE FOR!!!! My go to was always Bairrada Churrasqueira, but those days are behind me now.  Chicken is far better quality. I will agree, more than one hot sauce would be nice but I am sure if you ask they would give you 10!  I live in Etobicoke so there are not many places with really good Portuguese fare so I am glad to have been introduced to Ital Pizza.  Don't let the name fool ya, pizza is not the only delicious thing just waiting to be tasted here."}

{"text":"Stopped by this plaza for lunch and I was hoping to get some fish & chips next door @Martingrove Fish & Chips, but they are closed on Sundays. I was hungry and this was the only other restaurant in the plaza.   Pizza and portugese food? There was a giant chicken on their window so I (rightfully) assumed that there would be some yummy bbq chicken inside. Ordered a 1/2 chicken meal which comes with 2 sides. In our case, rice and potatoes. but you can choose from a variety of salads, fries, stuff.  There's some bar seating, but it's mainly take out.  The chicken was well seasoned. The salt gets a bit much at times, but the flavours are great. juicy dark meat, and a little dry white meat. saving grace were the potatoes cooked in chicken drippings. oh. so. good. not necessarily good for you.   There was pizza, but they looked a bit iffy sitting cooked and lonely on a metal tray. they boast stone ovens... though I don't think I'll be making a trip here for it."}
{"text":"One of my favourite mom'n'pop places in Etobicoke, and there are a lot of them! They do chicken the right way for sure.  What to expect -It is a small family business in a nice strip plaza with friendly owners and workers.  -They do have a chairs and tables but take out is really the way to go.  -They do AUTHENTIC Portuguese food and Italian pizza! Unique combination for a restaurant.  What to eat -You cannot go wrong with their signature Portuguese style BBQ chicken, it is juicy, flavourful and has that grilled flavour that I crave for. It is not like your grocery store rotisserie chicken!  -Calamari is done well, not rubbery or undercooked and is seasoned with lemon. It tastes like 5 STAR quality restaurant food, I promise.  -It is the first time I've tried bacalhau, the salted cod dish which can be a number of ways. It is a little salty for my liking and a bit too fishy.  -Parisienne Potatoes are DE-LISH if I do say so myself. Other sides are just OK.  This is definetely a must try if you want Portuguese chicken."}
{"text":"Well well not to long ago there were cockroaches were found while we were eating inside the restaurant and I left the pizza there and left the restaurant. I don't have to say anything ales"}
{"text":"So apparently there's a story behind this establishment...  At one time it used to only be a pizza place hence the name which was kept when the new owners took over.  The owners now have had the business for what would seem to be a decade or so but they kept the original name of the establishment even though pizza was not their specialty.  The new owners that took over Ital pizza wanted to add to the menu but also keep the pizza because they had a good customer base that was built on the pizza.  Adding to the pizza was a large addition of Portuguese chicken and other seafood such as cod, calamari,  as well as the sides that would go along with it.  This restaurant is basically only a take out and delivery establishment.  There is no eat in here.  I had ordered over the phone for pick up even though they do offer free delivery only because I wanted to see the establishment for myself.  I'm not sure what their delivery area limits are but delivery is not till after 5pm.  I had ordered 2 family chicken meals (each chicken comes with 2 sides for about 20 bucks) in which we had 4 sides:  2 rice, 1 potatoes and 1 veggies.  I also ordered a large pepperoni and mushroom pizza as well as an order of fried cod.  According to their menu you can order a large pizza for the price of a medium or an extra large for the price of a large.  The large is 16\" and the extra is 18\".  You can also order the pizzas in pairs with a discount as well.    I placed my order around 5pm on a Sunday and was told it would be ready in half an hour.  Well we arrived just a little bit after 530pm and everything was ready and kept warm.  For all the food it came out to just under 75 bucks.  It was a decent amount of food but the quality I have to say is really very good.  The chicken is well done with a good taste but not spicy.  They do include a couple hot sauces and I could have asked for more and I should have.  The sides included the 2 rice, potatoes and veggies.  The veggies consisted of mostly beans with some carrots served cold.  The potatoes were A1.  Amazing parisienne style hot and cooked properly.  The rice is sort of what I expected which was also good with good sized portions.  Overall the food was very good.  I liked the chicken and the quality of the meat.  The quantity of food we received was good and I have to say the cod is probably the highlight of what we ordered which as a tall feat because the pizza was also very good too.  The crust was not too thick and it tasted like a non chain type of pizza.    The pizza alone deserves 4 but the addition of all the other foods makes this place a complete type of restaurant for takeout.  I had originally ordered the pizza for the kids but found myself having more than one slice.  The chicken is quality and the cod is one of the best fried cod I've had.  While the cod has bones and skin I think that is what makes it better.  This is a real home cooking kind of place, not a food factory pumping out ready to go pizza like a chain.  So it's hard to say what kind of restaurant this is... is it a pizza place that has Portuguese bbq chicken or is it a Portuguese chicken place that happens to have pizza.  The pizza came first but the chicken is also good.  The cod well I've gone on about it but I have to say once more it's really worth coming back for.  I'll definitely be ordering again from Ital for future take out and family events.  The pizza I'd get for a week day kind of thing and get extra to take for lunch the next day.  As far as family establishments and home style cooking this is the place.  It's take out only so while you don't get to eat at their place you do get to have a family cooked meal with your family or friends."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place for lunch when I worked in the area.  When I changed jobs in 2010 I was no longer close so I haven't been in a while.  Today I was in the area and decided to drop in to see if the pizza was as I remembered it.  And you know what...it was!  I am a classic Cheese and Pepperoni kind of guy and their pizza is second to none.  The dough has a nice yeasty aroma and taste and the cheese they use is top notch.  And the size?  The $3.00 slices are about 50% larger than any of the chain places.  I can't speak for the chicken or other items but I have no problem recommending the pizza to anyone.  It is out of this world."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The pizza is fantastic. The chicken (grilled) is fantastic! We go here at least once a week for the dinner special!"}
{"text":"spent 15 minutes combing the internet for their menu, reading the yelp reviews, then finally decided to order.  i let the phone ring 15 times and hung up thinking, wow, they must be great if they're so busy.  called back in 5, rang another 10 times, now irritated.  called once more.  same thing.  saw the review about closing early.  what's the point of having posted hours if you're not going to honour them?   wasted 30 minutes on this joint for nothing."}
{"text":"Found this place not too long ago.love the bbq chicken here.i usually go for the 1/2 chicken combo. Portion sizes are good (sides includes) for the the price .only problem they only give you one hot sauce :("}
{"text":"The pizza tends to be very dry and burnt. No flavour nor taste at all."}
