{"text":"Best pierogis in town, hands down.  They have a deli counter and all kinds of fabulous food offerings, but it's the take-outs that are the gem. They only offer take-out on a Friday, but it's well worth the wait.   My friend had the corned beef and potato pancakes - a corned beef sandwich with (you guessed it) potato pancakes where the bread would be.  The corned beef is fabulous, and the serving size is gigantic.  I had the pierogis (I can't not) - they will let you split the order, so I ordered half potato & bacon and half potato & cheese - they came fried in butter and onions and served with coleslaw and sour cream. There was enough left over for supper, even with my appetite.    A heart-attack in a carry-out container, for sure, but what a way to go!"}
{"text":"Perhaps it's just me, but I find it really distasteful to turn the name of your Polish deli into a Holocaust joke. As a second generation Polish immigrant who lost most of her family to the Nazis, it's really nauseating to be honest.  Judging on the food itself, I was not a fan of the pierogi. The usage of instant potatoes in the pierogi was not the way my Babcia and Busia taught me to make them. They were bland, the dough was too chewy, and I've been making better pierogi at home with regular kitchen tools since I was a young lass. You can honestly get better pierogi if you buy frozen Mrs. T's from the grocery store. So one star for the pierogi, and if I could give zero stars for the name, I would. Cute location though. I guess that's an upside."}
{"text":"***Takeout is Friday only 11-630.  THE BEST POTATO PANCAKES EVER!  The pierogis are truly amazing! The potato bacon was great and the apple filled dessert is Fantastic.This is the second owner who took over in 1988. The prior owner started it all in 1934!  They have a 3.99 fish fry special.  I was given a FREE smokey as a first time customer.  Give this place a try and you will not be let down."}
{"text":"These are by far the best pierogis ever!! Not only do I frequently visit the restaurant, but I always purchase them at the grocery store! Yum yum, YUMMY!"}
{"text":"The best pierogi! I liked the potato not the sauerkraut.  They sell them cooked on Fridays at the store, but refrigerated  ones are just as fresh. They are fully cooked and easy to prepare. The sauerkraut are too sour. Otherwise I would give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"I cannot express and how many languages of my gratitude fresh good Polish food I must go I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Oooh!!!!!!! I was in the area and passed Sophie's choice with  Petes Deli just across the street...Same owners so when Sophie's makes stuff it goes right over to the deli and I gotta say... FANTASTIC!!!   Upon entry it feels like 1977 IN A GOOD WAY!!!!  pleasant aroma of a variety of meats that words just don't do justice with... I grabbed some ham salad--of which I haven't had in prolly 20 years? Got some Kielbasa and hot Italian sausage for dinner. the AWESOME chick behind the counter(GOD I wish I could remember her name...) threw some kielbasa in a pan to warm up... SO 'effing GOOD!!!!! Then she cut down a nice size smokey for me...I swear if I would have stayed longer I wouldn't have needed to eat dinner!!! It's right on Lee rd. and there is plenty of parking so if your on the east side you gotta pop in..."}
{"text":"The best potato pancakes I've ever had, by far. Pierogies were great, too - I highly recommend the apple ones for a different (yet absolutely delicious) sweet treat.   We stopped in around lunchtime on a Friday afternoon. The store is open all week (selling quality meats, excellent pierogies, and several other items), but they only offer take out on Fridays. Prices were reasonable. Staff was very friendly, answering our questions and letting us taste the smokies.  Wonderful, family-owned place worth checking out."}
{"text":"How did I forget to review this place?  Some of the best pierogi and potato pancakes you will find in the area. This is authentic polish food and you can tell by the flavor. The meat pierogi are my favorite! You can't go wrong with whatever flavor you get.  They have food available in stores as well a take out option. Wonderful place to get good home cooked polish food."}
{"text":"Carry out only!!! You walk in and feel like you have stepped back in time to a 1940s polish grocery. In the far corner is a little lunch counter. The lines tend to be a few minutes to order but your food is out in 5-10 minutes. The Pierogi's are Wonderful!!! We tried the potato, cheese and kraut. Potato pancakes are huge and thick. Also very delicious. The fish was less than good but still very edible."}
