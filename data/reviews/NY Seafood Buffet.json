{"text":"It should say oriental seafood, not very big selection of seafood and sad orange chicken was so tasteless, , had to eat pizza and it was so greasy i couldnt finish, will not go here ever again"}
{"text":"This was just bad. We went at peak dinner time but the food must have been sitting out since lunch. The coconut shrimp was so old that I couldn't even chew it. Same with the \"butterfly shrimp\" which was really just popcorn shrimp. The spring rolls were mushy on the inside. The fried dumplings were delicious but there were only 4 out when we arrived and no more were brought out in the hour we were there. The biggest disappointment was the hibachi grill. Only 2 meats and someone took the last of one of those meats. Not many other choices either.  We did eat our fill of crab legs thus the 2 star review. And for an establishment called a seafood buffet there was no more than you'd find at an other Chinese buffet. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Good selection of seafood. I don't eat the stuff but my wife and the rest of my family dug in lol there were other selections for the non ocean creature types but it was minimal. Oh well its in the name right. Any who not to bad and services were spot on. Refills on drinks a plenty with a cleared table almost continuously."}
{"text":"We used to go here often bring the whole family. Had a great selection and food was good. The last couple times the food quality has dropped and this time it was awful. Sushi was horrible and most of the food just looked awful and it was right at dinner time. Worst off as we were getting ready to leave I was going to leave a couple bucks for tip. Before I could the lady waiting on our table brought our bill from the front check register and said we didn't put a tip. And asked for a tip. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"ROACHES!!! Busser crushed one with his fingers right in front of me and then put it in his pocket and continued bussing tables like no big deal! Nothing was good. Crab legs were super old, gross, and small. Yuck!!!! No stars."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and we will be coming back. I have never had such great service. The lady clearing our table was amazing , fast and very helpful. Even my 10 month old loved her  at the end of our meal she came out with a big bowl of water for max to splash in to clean his hand s  the food was amazing too even tho it was close to closing"}
{"text":"This place along with the one off of Peoria and i17 by metro center is family owned, the health inspector shuts them down and they change family member names as owners and the restaurants name changes.... Do not eat here I snuck in the kitchen and it's a horror movie folks. Please be safe"}
{"text":"Good was good as Chinese buffets go. The sign advertises seafood which was limited and also said All You Can Eat Crab Legs. Wasn't one crab leg to be found. Sorry, I won't be back."}
{"text":"They had quite a lot to choose from but mostly everything was cold and for some reason they used a lot of mayo on things. It was just too much. Most likely will never go back."}
{"text":"CLOSED  Lights off Doors locked  When we first went back in 2013 the food and it was named Lin's we enjoyed it once in a while.  After the name changed things ,sadly,started to slide downhill."}
