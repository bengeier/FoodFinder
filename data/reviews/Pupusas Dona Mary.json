{"text":"My mother \"give them all the stars!\" Lol. The food was great. Authentic? Absolutely. The pupusas are not big in size like in most pupuserias I've been to but they are decently sized. I wasn't very hungry when I came in, had some, loved it and ordered more pupusas. I couldn't finish my first plate but that's how good they were. They didn't have diet soda but they were nice enough to allow me to bring in a Diet Coke from the CVS across. With the little army I came in here with, we had:
7 pupusas
2 tamales
Platanos con cream (desert)
Plato de chicharon (big portion)
Rice
3 drinks
All for 31 dollars."}
{"text":"3.5/5 stars. Just because we've had better pupusas and that place was closed, but these were very good! The Ensalada drink was delicious. They had a special of 3 Revuelta pupusas for $4.50. Will probably come back."}
{"text":"Needed more time, the popusa wasn't ready when serve, more flavor. The Agua de tamarinDo was delicious though!"}
{"text":"This place is a little spot behind the cvs the popusas are so good and fairly priced I'd recommend the chicharon con cheese one"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic, and affordable. I come here all the time and i have never been dissapointed. Place is also very clean even the restrooms lol."}
{"text":"I came in today to place a small order \"To Go\" but as soon as I walked in, the lady asked me if I was paying with a card... I said, 'Yes.'  She advised me that their machine was down.  I could see two other women back and forth on the phone trying to get the issue fixed.  I checked my wallet and I saw that I had $20 cash - perfect, because it was enough for the order I was going to make.  I let her know I could place my order after all and proceeded to order from the menu in front of me.  By the time she had my total, she said $19.49 so I handed her the $20 bill on my hand and she took it... she looks at her screen and then extends her hand back towards me with the bill and says, we fixed the machine did you still want to pay for it with your card?  I said, 'Sure.'  She gives me back my $20 bill, and I take my Debit card out.  Once she swiped my card, she says, 'I'm sorry I forgot to ask you if you wanted to do Debit?' but since I didn't mind, I just entered my pin on the keypad and she gave me my receipts - Order detail and transaction receipt.  My total had changed to $20.49   When I reviewed my receipt, I noticed that THEY CHARGED ME $1.00 TO USE MY CARD!!!  They have SEVERAL signs posted everywhere in their restaurant and I did not see one nor was I advised that there was a fee to use my card, especially when she knew I had already handed her cash!  Now I understand why they have such a huge sign saying:  WE CANT EXCHANGE FOOD OR MONEY AFTER AN ORDER HAS BEEN PLACED.  So I didn't say anything because I wanted to enjoy my food and I had ordered it 'To Go' for a reason.  I waited 25 minutes to get my meal.         

I ordered three #43 'Empanadas de Platano'  ($1.50/ea) they are DELICIOUS and a good size.  Make sure you eat them when they're served warm.  They make them very good.  I had #44 'Platano Frito con Crema' ($5.95) and that was good too.  The fried plantains were cooked perfectly and the refried beans w/crema were just right.  The sad part is that their Pupusas were not good at all, at least not today.  I only ordered two of the Pork with Cheese and the third with Loroco.  They were small and not filled much.  The curtido/coleslaw was very plain, not like the traditional Salvadorian curtido I've tried everywhere.  The tomato sauce was mild but very watery.  I will only go back for the empanadas de platano here but as far as the Pupusas... no, I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.  I paid $2.50/each and they weren't even good at all."}
{"text":"The cheese and chicharon Pupusas were very good. I ordered to go, would of liked more \"curtido\" for the amount of pupusas I ordered but loved both the red and green chile salsa. Overall was pleased with the taste."}
{"text":"Ordered one of each of their pupusas. They were made to order, really fresh. The cashier was very nice and the people seemed happy to want to help you. The curtido was nice and crisp, hate when it's been sitting out in a while.. their salsas weren't very spicy, but that's ok cuz they had other sauces available on the table. The agua de Jamaica was one of the best ones I've had in a while. Would really recommend this place if you're craving great and fresh pupusas."}
{"text":"Service was great food was hot and ready the tamales Masa was excellent all the car note was delicious. I had a really great experience at this restaurant my girlfriend kind of drug me here not really knowing what I was going to get myself into I have never really tasted the cuisine before. But I must say it was extremely delicious I left a $20 tip is how impressed I was with my meal. For $12 two tamales 2 empanadas 2 pupusas. Highly recommend the food here great menu great service. What more can you ask for. Will definitely be going back in the future"}
{"text":"The pupusas are perfect! This is a little, hidden-away joint tucked in between a bunch of industrial companies. It's a tiny whole-in-the-wall, family owned joint (from El Salvador). Their pupusas are perfectly seasoned, hand made, and delicious; every single time."}
{"text":"Amazing pupusas and 5 star quality customer service. Today I ordered 20 pupusas for a banquet and needed them early in the morning. Even though the restaurant doesn't open until 9:00 a.m. the owner graciously came in at 7:00 a.m. which was the time I told her I needed to pick up the food. This type of service creates devoted customers for life! I wish other restaurants and businesses in general would understand that all you have to do is show commitment and go out of your way just a little and customers will notice and keep coming back, what a concept.. 

Thank you Dona Mary for helping me out!! This is the least I can do to return the favor, much appreciate your service and food:)"}
{"text":"Miren mucha!!! Estas sipotas estan Buenas para tortiar,  Las pupusas Estaban calidad mucha...esta bueno y limpio mucha....."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch.  Best Salvadoran food I've had in the valley.  Chicken tamales were excellent, especially the masa.  Pupusas filled with beans and cheese.  Reminded me of Venezuelan arepas.  Yummmmm.  Not a fancy place but they have a long menu, something to please everyone, and great home-style cooking.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"we've been here before and the place was good, food was good, but today we had an incident where they didn't have the drink we had ordered and paid for, so we told them it was Ok, that we wanted the money back then. But then they refused to give us our money back and instead offered a different drink, which we didn't want. So, we ask to talk to a manager or the owner, but the workers said the owner wouldn't be there until tomorrow, and that they didn't have a manager. Finally after and only after we start to push for our money back they gave it to us reluctantly, because according to them the owner would discount that money from their paycheck, which by the way it's also wrong.. Very bad service and experience. I don't know the name of the employees but they were working there at 3pm on tuesday July 18, 2017. I hope the manager or owner read this post and fix that.

Hemos estado aquí antes y el lugar era bueno, la comida era buena, pero hoy tuvimos un incidente donde no tenían la bebida que habíamos pedido y pagamos, así que les dijimos que estaba bien, que queríamos el dinero en aquel momento. Pero luego se negaron a darnos el dinero y en vez ofrecía una bebida diferente, que no queríamos. Por lo tanto, pedimos hablar con un gerente o el propietario, pero los trabajadores dijeron que el propietario no estaría allí hasta mañana, y que no tienen un gerente. Finalmente después y sólo después de empezar a empujar por nuestro dinero nos dieron a nosotros a regañadientes, porque según ellas el propietario les descontaria ese dinero de su cheque de pago, que por cierto esta también malo .. Muy mal servicio y experiencia. No sé el nombre de los empleados, pero estaban trabajando allí a las 3 pm el martes 18 de julio 2017. Espero que el gerente o propietario lean este post y arreglen eso."}
{"text":"I am not a Salvadoran food fanatic, but my husband is (he is Salvadoran), so I am writing this for him. We go to this place at least once a month so he can get his Salvadoran craving fulfilled, since I don't cook that stuff. He loved it at first, but over time, he's noticed that the quality has changed. It's not as authentic as it once was, taste-wise. Also, he hates that they now charge to use a debit/credit card and that you have to prepay for a phone order over the phone and they charge you this fee, without even giving you the option of picking up and then paying with cash to avoid the $1 fee. Sometimes he goes more than once a month, so this fee will add up to the value of an horchata or so, which is what bugs him. Nice ladies, just maybe it's gotten busier and they're losing touch of what their main focus should be...the food?"}
{"text":"I had not been here for a few months and not only did they renovate the place, but they also totally brought the prices up on their whole menu. That was very disappointing. It's also very annoying that they charge a dollar to use your credit card. I give it three stars because the food is pretty authentic Salvadorian food. The place is always very clean and the service is polite. I will continue to visit this place."}
{"text":"I ordered some pastelitos and was really looking forward to them.... I ate one and it made me sick. I didn't  like the color of the ground beef. I guess it wasn't fresh or something. I was also very surprised at their prices. They charge $3.00 for a cheese pupusa!!!! Also, if you pay with your ATM or credit card they charge $1.00 to use it regardless of how much you spend....."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome, it was empty when we walked in but smelled so delicious.  We ordered 9 pupusas revueltas.  They have a varied menu which everything looked delicious but you have to start with the basics no?  They were yummy.... Not too greasy, kind of crispy, and perfect amount of cheese, beans, and chicharon.  Will definitely come back here...."}
{"text":"The water was very good! Authentic place to come and eat. However my food wasn't fully cooked when I was eating it the \"masa\" was still raw. 
Pupusas de chicharrón mucha sal.
Pero las aguas bien Ricas. Pienso que este lugar puede aser un mejor esfuerzo con la comida. La gente muy amable nomás es la comida se le pasó algunas cosas masa cruda y muy saldada mi plato. Provecho. !"}
