{"text":"After leaving the Galleria mall, me and my wife noticed the Saucy bistro. It looks really nice from the outside. It was 2130 on a Saturday and barely any cars were in the parking lot. We noticed a lot of advised specials on the outside of the building. The interior is different but nice. We were seated and asked our waitress about the specials. She began to tell us and then a woman with short blonde hair interrupted and rudely said the happy hour specials don't start until 2200. I guess she's the manager. I understand rules, but C'mon, the place was empty. So the end result was that me and my wife left and they made zero dollars instead of something. I gave it three stars because of the decor and the possibility of decent food"}
{"text":"The food is very good, and the restaurant is comfortable. I like to take my family here for dinner, but the bar isn't a bad place to wind down after work either.  The servers are nice (ask for Gera, she's my favorite), and well informed on the menu."}
{"text":"Behind the Galleria Mall on Mall Ring Circle. This location has been several restaurants and after our dinner, we hope that this one succeeds.

We stopped in just to give it a try. It has just opened and only a few cars there and we were a little apprehensive but because it has only been open for a few weeks, we gave it a try. It was fabulous. The waitress/hostess was delightful - could not have been better. Everything was very fresh, made on site with the exception of the pasta we were told but our only complaint was that the portions were too big. We want this place to be successful so we would offer a suggestion that they also offer 1/2 servings. As a matter of controlling proper food costs. 

The Mediterranean Salad with a great lemon dressing, the Piccata and Marsala were excellent and we always judge an Italian restaurant by their meatballs so we ordered one. It was great. I am from the northeast and love Italian food and happy to find this place. 

With the new food offerings at the mall due to be completed by the first of the year, it would be nice to see Sauce develop a following before then. The restaurant is nice and fingers crossed that they make it in that location"}
{"text":"First impression. 
Trash strewn about the front door , over flowing trash bin as u enter , weeds growing all over the landscaping . 
When the place looks like this on the outside , Its no surprise to see an empty establishment on the inside. 

The place has no real identity as to what it wants to be . Bar / Resturant  or what .... 
Food is absolutely nothing to be desired as the pastas are over priced and just not good. The food came quickly which tells me that the microwave is used frequently to reheat ur food . The same food that's ever so eloquently advertised on the menu as fresh. 
How can it food be so fresh when the place is dead/asleep ... No customers = no turnover = spoiled fast prepared food . 
The staff just looks like they don't want to be there . 
The management just don't care and the owners either are not aware or are of the same mentality. If this place is still around in a year I will eat my shoe..... 
Btw ,  I ordered a draft beer which was not cold . Even the coke was flat and had a weird flavor.  If ur appreciate mediocrity and have low standards for where u eat , than u won't mind this place and this review is not for u . But if care about quality , than stay away from this place . Instead of Sauce it should be called Shit !!!!"}
{"text":"This food is fabulous.  I have not had food this good in years.  I can guarantee I will be ordering from this place at least once a week"}
{"text":"I had driven by this place for a while and finally noticed it had opened. About a week ago my wife, kids and I decided to try it.
We were sat right away but waited at a table for about 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. The restaurant was not very busy but the service staff seemed to be very disorganized. The waitress, while very personable kept forgetting things and along with the rest of the staff seemed a little lost in what they were doing. 

The food was pretty good though. My kids got a pizza that surpassed expectations. I grew up in an Italian family and have a friend who owns a popular pizza place in town, so I'm kind of picky if not a little spoiled by good pizza. The crust was by far the best part. 
If I had one gripe about the food it would be that my penne pasta in the pesto cream sauce was more like a soup there was so much sauce. Just because the name on the sign says sauce, you don't need to drown the poor pasta. Although I did appreciate that they had a few unique sauce choices like the pesto cream. 

I would go back here again because the food was good, though I hope the service is able to improve. Also in the men's room one toilet and both paper towel dispensers were broke. I had made a passing comment to the host at the front about the paper towels and he just sort of blew it off. It seems as if the owners and staff are somewhat struggling getting a new venture up and running. Hopefully they are able to."}
{"text":"Great place, 5 stars, was greater by a nice young man who then offered us happy hour  at the bar or the dinning room. I choices happy hour besides there was like 6 different ball games on all there tvs. We had a server named lisa, she was so Kool and friendly, she treated us like we knew each other forever not like we were guest. After we ordered some food while we were waiting she offered to take us around and show us the other side of the building, boy is it big, any Way there was a dance club karaoke  room a private  bar. I was like wow this place is great. Think I'm gonna hold my b day there. Anyway food was like from back east. Service best in Vegas. Will be back at least 2 more times it's week"}
{"text":"We were shopping at the mall and noticed a new restaurant had opened in this location.  I then remembered seeing a Groupon , so even more reason to try it out.  The happy hour prices and hours look good!  My son ordered the BBQ wings- 10 for $8.50 (decent amount for price).  He also got the BBQ bacon cheeseburger with fries.  Burger was large and tasted good.  The fries were nothing fancy.  I went out on a limb and ordered the lasagna.   Decent sized portion and good flavor.  There was a good amount of cheese and meats, as well as fresh basil on top!  Out server, Matt, was friendly.  I would come back to try a few of the other dishes!"}
{"text":"I was there for a birthday celebration, which celebrated three people, last Sunday,  March 13, 2016. After waiting for an hour and never receiving any service, I decided to leave. I was later told by my friend that there was only one Server on duty for over 50 people. I understand watching your bottom line, but this was ridiculous. My first and last time at this establishment!"}
{"text":"Called was on  hold for about 15 min walked in to find only bartender there talking it up with the only 2 customers there and me on hold. Food ok service is  horrible.... Food takes for ever to come out."}
{"text":"First time, had Lemon Butter Sauce over Angel Hair Pasta. Toppings: red roasted peppers and mushrooms... then made critical mistake of paying $4 extra for 4 shrimp. The shrimp were sooo over cooked they cooked have bounced to the ceiling! (My daughters were the same way) Omit the shrimp and the Pasta and the Sauce were Fabulous!!  Split a Cannoli (first time), it was good. Not huge fan. Service was great however we ate an Early dinner so was not busy yet. She was very friendly. By the end of our dinner it was starting to get busy. Service slacked a little. Waited 15 mins. to come back and take check,  had to flag someone down to come take so we could pay and leave. 
All in all I would go back, many other tempting items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! I enjoy the pasta & pizzas. They have a breakfast hamburger that is out of this world, definitely worth coming in for. It's a fun atmosphere to have a nice dinner out or family gathering. I am so glad I found this place!!!"}
{"text":"Order placed at 5:20p, it arrived at 8p... ridiculous. This is only my 2nd review ive left on yelp. Food is absolutely lack-luster and barely even warm, i would have refused the order but the soup still felt warm through the container, wrong. I tried calling about 10 times, busy signal every time... the one time it rings and it disconnects me. Absolutely want a refund.... better food at basic fast food places and it doesnt cost a $10 delivery fee and a near 3 hr wait time. I am a VERY reasonable person in these situations as I have worked in the hospitality and service industry in Vegas for pushing 13 yrs now... the driver was appologetic but as i mentioned to him I doubt its his fault. I would have requested him to call the restaurant to discuss it with management but I doubted he would even get ahold of them and was done wasting my time. We arent even eating the food, we ordered from another place and now have to wait longer. Do not order from this place."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Sitting at the bar as we speak. We had every intention on ordering food and really giving this place a shot even though some of the poor reviews. But, I will tell you right off...the reviews are not wrong! Don't know the rude daytime bartenders name because we weren't greeted and nor did I care to ask due to her poor attitude. Told right off, once I asked how she was...\"Oh well, just fine but running my ass off because a server called out!\" Ummm...let me just say...First of all, I as a patron don't need to know that. Second of all, there are NO tables in here. None. One guy at the bar. Wow! Let me just also mention when I asked for a beer/wine list I got a snotty response of \"we don't have one, it changes all the time\" Well, get one and tell your patrons of the changes or list subject to change on it. Also, they have a homebrew that is contracted out for them. I asked who makes it and I got \"I don't know\". Wow! You guys are new and unfortunately will close just as young and new. Owners/Management....make some changes before its too late."}
{"text":"We went there twice so far. Both times the food was very good, big portions, and fairly priced. The best part was that the pasta was HOT! We get so tired of the lukewarm pasta you get in many places. The down side was the men's restroom. The first time it was plain filthy, the next time no paper towels at all. The ambiance in the bar and dining area is very nice, the karaoke room was much less and far too loud, at least for the one time we went. We would love to see this place stay and be successful and it could with some TLC."}
{"text":"First off, let me preface this with us having read the Yelp reviews, so we expected to wait for our food.  We had a $30 Groupon discount for this establishment, so we figured it would make a good date night.  It turned out that this was the worst experience we have ever had at a restaurant.

The place was busy, a good sign.  We are told that it would be about 15 minutes to get seated.  No worries.  There is a bar and a lounge (a couch, pool table, and 3 arcade games).  There is not any real seating and it is uncomfortably warm in the waiting area.  

We finally get seated, look over the menu, and then order.  First off, we order an appetizer, pasta, a pizza, and I also order a beer.  Our waitress says they do not have that beer.  Not as in they ran out, but as in they do not stock it.  We show her the menu and she asks another waitress before she accepts it an takes down the order.  We get glasses of water.

And we wait... and wait... and wait...

Maybe 30 minutes later, my beer is finally served.  Soon after, the appetizer shows up.  Okay, so they are busy.  Definitely short staffed; maybe some of their staff called out.  But now, we are at the head of the queue and they are preparing our food... or so we hoped.

And we wait... and wait... and wait...

Our bruschetta is long gone, our water is nearly empty, and I am trying to make my beer last.  All of our talk between my girlfriend and I has petered out, we have looked around at all of the other patrons, and have succumbed to staring at the ceiling.  My bowl of pasta arrives.  As I am a gentleman, I do not start eating and wait for my girlfriend's pizza to arrive.

And we wait... and wait... and wait...

Most restaurants would question when one single-serving plate is delivered, and there are two people sitting at the table.  They would inquire if you are waiting for any more food.  At this point, we are gave up on a good dinner and are just waiting to see how long until they notice that they messed up.  The romantic atmosphere is gone.  She begs me to eat my food before it gets cold.  I try to give her some, but she only take a few bites.  I begin to eat my pasta, hoping that at any moment her food would be delivered.

And we wait... and wait... and wait...

I am over half way done with my plate before the waitress comes over to ask me how my food was, when she realizes something is wrong and asks my girlfriend if she is waiting on anything.  We inform her that we are still waiting on a pizza.  The waitress leaves our table to go back and check on it.  She soon returns and apologizes because she forgot to put in the order for the pizza, but she says she will comp the pizza.  Okay... mea culpa.  She says in exact terms, that it will be out in 8 minutes.  We wait eight minutes...

And we wait... and wait... and wait...

I am done with my pasta.  All of our drinks are bone dry.  We tell our waitress that she should put the pizza in a to-go box.  She tells us that it will be out in just a few minutes.  She asks us about how we want to use our $60 groupon or save it for next time.  We inform her that it was only a $30 groupon.  We could have gone with it and got an extra $30 worth of free food, but it was not worth it.  We already said how we are never going to come back and there is no way we were going to wait any longer for more food to be prepared and served.  So at this point, we know between the groupon and the comp, our bill would be basically nothing.

And we wait... and wait... and wait...

At this time, there are very few people still eating in the restaurant.  Another waitress comes over and asks us if we wanted refills, we decline because we know it will take an eternity and we just cannot wait to leave.  I am biting my tongue trying not to explode as my girlfriend praises me for not making a scene.  I put my head in my hands.

And we wait... and wait... and wait...

After a time of 8 minutes plus 30, the hostess who is now cleaning tables approaches us and asks us if everything is okay.  I ask her to go please check on the status of our pizza.  She says that is it being boxed and will be right out.  Almost immediately, the pizza is brought out.  That makes me think that it was sitting and waiting to be brought out... for who knows how long.  

We are presented with a bill for $1.08.  Seriously... We wait for over one and a half hours for some bread with tomatoes, a bowl of pasta, and a pizza, and then you have the audacity to not comp the remaining dollar?!?  

We leave the restaurant.  The only thing I want to do is run; praying that the food does not get me sick."}
{"text":"The food is decent, the price is good but the delivery time is awful!!!! Was originally told it would be 60 minutes. Then I got a text saying it would've an hour and a half. Then the hour and a half came and went and still no food. Super upsetting!!!"}
{"text":"So after my last review I decided to order out a few times since then. A PERFECT SCORE STILL STANDS PEOPLE. My delivery time each and every order so far has been well within reasonable timing and the food has been warm and yummy every time! I even ordered a huge order my last time for a big get together and everything arrived just as ordered. I'll be a repeat customer no doubts about it! 
ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Yikes, previous reviews really ripped this place a new one, but I've gotta say... We have a great experience. Contrary to previous issues, our server/bartender was tentative, polite and friendly. The food came out in fair time and was WOW surprisingly delicious. Bar food with a bit of culinary spritz. I dig it. We will be back again for sure. And it's so close to the mall... Perfect lunch time meet up spot."}
{"text":"Absolute worst customer service you could ever imagine. If I could give zero stars I would. I tried to place a delivery order for my mom so she could have dinner as I do not live in the same state. They were over 2 hours late, with no phone call to let me know they were running late. The girl answering the phone had no clue whats going on, the lack of leadership their is mind-blowing, assuming the owner has no control or involvement of his business. Such a shame. This place will be out of business within a year."}
{"text":"Great location/area, but won't be returning:

Went in on a Tuesday night with my husband and preschooler.  The bar area was full as the happy hour offerings are only available there.  We were seated in the back of the restaurant in a booth by a less-than-friendly hostess and told we'd be helped shortly.  There were no other patrons in the area we were seated which was fine and not uncommon as we were a family with a small child.

Fifteen minutes later we still hadn't seen our server.  I walked up to the bar where the bartender and a server were chatting and asked for assistance.  When I mentioned we'd been waiting for a while, they asked if we had seated ourselves...

The server that did eventually come to us was friendly and apologetic and said she wasn't told she had a table waiting.

Now I understand this does happen and I'd absolutely come back for another try...IF their food was tolerable.  We ordered garlic knots, which had no hint of garlic at all.  The \"marinara\" sauce that came with the knots was bland and watery.  The pizza we shared was also bland, and the french fries tasted old.

I hear their happy hour offerings are wonderful, and perhaps tasty with a few beers, but not for a hungry family."}
{"text":"I would call myself an Italian food snob. I come from a large Italian family on the east coast. I love cooking Italian food and im very very good at it. so when i eat Italian food out i have high standers. SAUCE has met those standars. You can tell everything is freshly made on site. i had the Italian chimichanga OMG you have to try it. what a great fusion of Mexican and Italian. i also took a large cheese pizza to go for a late night snack for after the club. The pizza was awsome also.A chill casual place to have some good Italian food. I will be back,"}
{"text":"We love this place!  The atmosphere and decoration is dark yet inviting.  There is always a host/hostess to greet you at the door and seat you, however wait times can vary.  What keeps me coming back is the great happy hour specials, which include great food and drink specials that they serve at the bar area only-however, they have a few tables that can accomodate under 21 crowd in the bar area so they can partake in happy hour as well.  Everything is homemade so expect to be waiting a little longer for you entree, but spoil yourself with the AMAZING garlic knots while you're waiting and you'll be fine.  Everyone is so friendly and the pasta is just delicious, the pizza is to die for.  They have large screen tv's, a pool table area, and a large brick oven where the pizza is prepared.  It's close to the galleria mall, so the perfect location for a pick me up after shopping or running errands, I highly recommend giving it a shot!"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour,  great happy hour appetizers,  eats are great.  Bartenders,  Chris & Chris are AWESOME.  Never an empty glass, cheerful and very polite.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Last night my wife, best friend and myself were out trying to get some some dinner for my wife's bday. I called SAUCE asking how late the kitchen was open and then said we would be there in a few. When we arrived we had no idea they were having a club night at the restaurant. When we were greeted at the door by 5 bouncers we were asked to prove that we had spoke to someone about coming. After convincing them we weren't lying and that we only wanted food they agreed to let us in but that I had to get a pat down. I was not open to the pat down for I have never gotten one to eat FOOD in my life. I said no thanks and we can just get the food to go, They denied me and said for us to leave but in a hostile way. As we were leaving one of the bouncers took off his jacket and started following us talking crap and telling us to fight him. I asked for them to get the manager for we were being harassed  and they then threatened to call the police on me. I called the building and had the manage  come out but when she did even though she knew the staff member tried to fight me and threaten to call the police she was ok with it and didn't care. The staffer still talked crap in front of her as we walked to our car. I will never again go there since management does not care about a customers wellbeing and condones harassment and pushing away a paying customer on their bday. Beware if you go there on a Friday night, you won't be welcome and most likely will be harassed by a washed up staff that believes they work at a strip nightclub!"}
{"text":"We went to Sauce because our local food reviewer gave it a glowing review. We went on a Friday night on the late side, about 8:00 pm. The restaurant is decorated okay, it has booths, and tables but it's strangely laid out, the dinning room is on the small side compared to the huge bar area and it has a bit of a cold feel to it. The restaurant was half full and we were told it would be a 15-20 minute wait for a table or we could sit at the bar and eat with no wait, we opted for a table but went to the bar for a drink. The bar has plenty of seating and multiple TV's. The bartender was nice and waited on us quickly. I had a beer and my husband had a well cocktail. The drink prices are on the high side, it was $5 dollars for my draft Miller Lite, I think that's high, they did have a beer special but we weren't told about it until after we were done ordering. 30 minutes later we were seated in a booth. It took our server longer than it should have to come to the table so we had already looked at the menu and decided on an appetizer. We ordered the Pepperoni Stuffed Cheese (which was the one the reviewer raved about), the waiter told us they were out of them as well as our 2nd choice which was the Arancini. We told the waiter we were pretty disappointed and he replied with \" sorry, this is my 2nd job and I'm just trying to make a few extra bucks, we didn't know our review would be in today's paper and we had two big parties come in.\" He pointed to the two tables, one was a party of 10 and the other was a party of about 8, other than those two tables there were 3 parties of two each including us.... that doesn't seem like enough business, to run out of your signature items. A table of two near us ordered sandwiches for dinner and were also told they were out of whatever it was they ordered, pretty disappointing. We ended up ordering the Garlic Knotts,a half caesar salad, husband had Chicken Parmesan and I had pasta with Rose sauce. The food took forever, the waiter kept saying he was sorry and as soon as the big parties leave our food should be up next. It took 35 minutes for any food to arrive and when it did, it all came at the same time, something we just hate. The Garlic Knotts were fine, nothing special, they come with Marinara sauce for dipping which was good. Ceasar salad was good, lettuce was cold, fresh and the dressing was very good, not a ton of dressing but I don't like my salad drenched so it was fine and the half order was the perfect size. My pasta with rose sauce was OK, the pasta was a bit overcooked but that's not a big thing to me, the sauce which the waiter had told me was a \"light\" cream sauce (menu says it's Marinara with a touch of Alfredo) was not light and it was a bit oily, where you could see the oil around the edge of the bowl, flavor was not bad, but I would say it was more Alfredo with a touch of Marinara. Husband's Chicken Parmesan was not good at all. I'm surprised at the other reviews that say how good it is... we are Italian and maybe that's the difference, I don't know. The chicken was a big, thick piece of chicken with flavorless breading, covered in melted cheese and sauce....Chicken Parm should be a nice cutlet of chicken with seasoned breading, sauce and not buried in cheese, you should be able to taste the chicken cutlet not just a gooey mass of cheese. Our bill for two with tip was $91... not crazy expensive but there are other Italian places (Ventano's - Tuscany Grill) with great food for as much or less. So, between the wait for the table, the high beer price, them being out of the appetizer's we went there for and the marginal wait service, we will not try them again. . This is the second time we have tried a restaurant our local food reviewer recommended, both were Italian and both were not good, I don't think we'll go with her recommendations anymore."}
{"text":"I had the \"create your own pasta\".  I got whole wheat penne with pomodoro sauce, sun dried tomatoes, roasted garlic, sautéed spinach and artichoke hearts.  It was amazing."}
{"text":"By far the worst experience I have ever had.  This issue took place over six months and it still bothers me to this day.  Not sure how or why this place is still in business.  

We ordered one of their super wonderful online specials.  The delivery time frame was maybe 45-60 minutes but they NEVER arrived with our food,  Even after I placed a call checking on the food.  They said that somehow our order was missed but it would be coming.  After two hours, I called back asking for a refund.  The manager was very apologetic and offered to give us our next $30 order for free.  I said I would let her know if I was interested....yeah six months later, I can honestly say I would never order from this place."}
{"text":"I have orderedfrom this place a few times and its probably my favorite. Food is always delivered hot and fresh, usually sooner than anticipated, every item I order is my new favorite. Pizza is sooo good, especially the Quattro Formaggi, eggplant rollotini wad big and deliciiys enough for lunch the next day as well, and the potato soup is Heaven. I am rarely impressed with a restuarant and they are one if very few that I have eaten more than once."}
{"text":"82-year old dad can't stop saying how delicious it is. Ordered Steak Florio through Eat24 app and delivery was about 45 minutes from the order time about 10:15 pm so excellent food and service. Thank you and Yahushua (Jesus) loves you."}
{"text":"I always enjoy going to sauce, but this time I ordered in with delivery. I just got my 16 inch pizza....too bad it's 11 inches. Disappointed. So much for dinner."}
{"text":"The restaurant is well Named--the home made sauce is fantastic. The bread is addicting and also home made. Very friendly staff. Looks like they have a great happy hour so we will be back for that. We didn't like the balsamic salad dressing because it was thicker than we prefer but otherwise great food."}
{"text":"Awesome spot to take the family and an even better spot for date night! The hosts are always prompt and the service is exceptional. Our expections are beat everytime we come, and if we arent cooking we'll be at Sauce! The daily specials can't be beat....salad and wings are our current fav!"}
{"text":"Love the food! One of the best burgers I have had since moving to Vegas... My husband loves the pizza. However we ordered delivery and while I understand that there is quite the distance from their restaurant to my home it has never taken them longer than 1 hour and 30 minutes.. The last time I ordered I called to make sure everything was ok at 2 hours and 15 minutes. When I asked the manager if the order was on its way the manager immediately became rude! Now I love this place but I was not trying to argue I was only attempting to check on my order! I was told by the manager that I should come in and not order delivery if I wanted faster service! So I am very sad to say that I will not order from here again BUT if you do not want delivery the burgers are really great here!"}
{"text":"Horrible! We waited 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge us... Never happened... we just left!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best Italian food anywhere in town, and I am never disappointed by what we order.  Amazing soup, great pizza, and terrific pasta.

The only thing that I have not enjoyed was the Caesar salad, but who goes to a place like this for salads?  Stick to the main dishes, and you cannot go wrong.  

The happy hour prices are great, and the garlic knots for $3 are out of this world.  

Donnie is the bartender that's been there the last several times we've gone, and he is the best.  He offers great customer service and super friendly."}
{"text":"This establishment is a joke and lies to their customers. The pizza was 'out of the freezer' quality and I would not recommend this place to anyone. 

I ordered food off grub hub 9:30pm and it was supposed to be delivered at 11:00pm. Around 11:20 I called the store wondering where my food was. The manager said that the food was on it's way and would be there shortly. Around 11:45 my food still had not arrived and I called the store back. The manager said that he could not get ahold of the driver but would refund me my order, have it remade immediately and sent with another driver. My food showed up a little after 1:00AM over 3.5 hours later! After a few days I checked my bank statement and they still had not refunded me from my order. I called the store and spoke with the same manager who said that he would contact grubhub and have the charges dropped. Another few days go by and the charges still have not dropped off my account. I contacted grubhub directly who then spoke with the manager and he said that they will not be refunding me any amount since I got my food."}
{"text":"Well all I can say is Beware. I believe the food I received was not prepared on property. It needs many improvements. Window and floors needed cleaning"}
{"text":"Never get a delivery from them. Just like another reviewer Amanda we had a horrible experience. Placed an order around 8:54pm said be here by 10:27. I call to confirm order, she says driver is almost there i see him. 11:15pm i call, rings for long time then i say hello i called you earlier about an order. Then lady says hello, hello. Then hangs up and what do you know phone is busy... Hmmmm. Don't know what their food is like but oh well we will NEVER KNOW. Now im hour and a half late on taking my meds because i got to take it with FOOD."}
{"text":"We had a great experience... Jason was sour waiter, nice guy.
Food~ spinach artichoke dip, good. Bruccetta has a different bread but was tasty. Stuffed cheese, super tasty sauce. 
Eggplant dishes, so good!!! Dad had chicken Marshall, says it was good. Salad, AWESOME. 
To top it all off, everything is 1/2 off on Wednesday!!!
It's a perfect time to try it."}
{"text":"Wow. A great surprise this restaurant was.   We were here at 2 pm on a Monday and the place was empty. I don't know why the food is awesome! !we had a great server named Salina that went out of her way to accommodate us. .we can't eat spicy foods and we wanted to try the fried mac n cheese but it had jalapeños in it. .she asked the chef and he made a special batch for us omitting the jalapeños . Awesome! ! Than we ordered our entree I had the lasagna and it was a large portion with tons of meat cheese and sauce my partner ordered the chicken Parmesan and the chicken was lathe and very tender. The noodles were perfectly cooked (they Evan asked what kind of noodle he wanted). If I we're going to fault anything it would be that the food didn't come with garlic bread (even though you get bread with oil when you sit down) and soup or salad is extra.   I would recommend this restaurant very much! !!"}
{"text":"We had dinner with friends. All 4 meals were awesome. Tried Napoli pizza and crab cakes for appy's and both were excellent. Crust was thick but flavorful and tomatoes were sweet. Cannoli for dessert was crisp with a cinnamon cream. They only strange moment was that they were completely out of coffee. \"The boss\" went out and bought some, we waited a few minutes and when it came it was only luke warm. The comped the coffee (although we did not complain). Nice atmosphere, excellent service. Absolutely would recommend it and we will go back again (and likely again). Worried that it wasn't very busy for a Friday night. They need more advertising and some solid word of mouth reputation. Great place ... no reason for you not to try it out!"}
{"text":"They do have some tasty sauces.  I'm disappointed with the price and the quantity of food you get.   For an avg price of $17.00 per dish, they could give u more.  My wife had shrimp scampi which was served with 4 tiny tiny shrimp.    Avg bill we walk out of there for 2 pasta dishes and two sodas is 50.00 without the tip.  I would say it's worth it if you get one of their bogo coupons in the mail.    Otherwise to me, it's too pricy for what u get.  No problems with servers or restaurant looks."}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. A few more weeks of practice and training the new people and this would be an even better place."}
{"text":"Service is horrible. Waiter disappeared. A second waiter purposely ignored us on two occasions. Very disappointed. Food was ok"}
{"text":"We drive from the Southwest to enjoy their happy hour, the chicken wings and garlic knots is a little piece of heaven. Our experience is always stellar when Kelly is there, and now she has Selena to deliver the same great service. We stopped coming for a time due to an employee who lacked customer relations (I generally like to be treated like a human when I patronize a restaurant). Now that the person is gone we are happily back to enjoy the good food and service!"}
{"text":"I've never been to the restaurant, but get delivery often.  Pizza is very good, but not amazing.  Same for the chicken parm.  I love the build your own pasta- penne, alfredo, chicken, broccoli and garlic.  mmmmm delish.  The garlic knots are good, but I've had better.  Decent canolli's Don't expect to die for food, but a solid delivery joint."}
{"text":"The Calamari is the best in Vegas.  Service was great,  we went late at night and everything was promptly taken care of.  I ordered the meatball sandwich and I asked for the sauce to be spicy, it was perfectly seasoned."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place the other night for the first time, and the food was very good. It was a nice and quiet atmosphere, so we were able to sit and visit. Very enjoyable. He got the chicken parm, and I got the spaghetti and meatballs. Mine was very good, but his was even better. I guess they deliver, as well, and as new customers they gave us a coupon to use if we order a delivery. Overall, I really liked it. :)"}
{"text":"There for lunch today.  From the parking lot, we could not be sure that they were even open. Appeared to be only one waitress in the restaurant-- working as host, bartender, and waitress.  There was one other table being helped. We ordered beers, a pasta dish, and Tuscan panino. We got the beers quickly, but it took over 30 minutes to get our ordered dishes.  A couple who came in about 15 minutes after us was served first!

Country-style music playing way to loud.  Possibly because of lack of diners the reverberation was painful at times.

My panino was only OK.  Bread was so hard it was difficult to cut and chew even after sitting in the juices from the tomatoes and artichoke hearts.  Pasta was adequate.  

Definitely not the place to go for lunch if you only have 30-60 minutes.

Won't go again."}
{"text":"Calamari....Calamari.....Did I say Calamari?!!!! Best EVER!!!  They also have amazing pasta's and pizza!!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Sauce. The food has been excellent on both visits. The customer service is great and they also have great music and a great atmosphere. Our last visit we were able to enjoy dinner while watching the Olympics on their oversized televisions."}
{"text":"Waited forever for drinks. Then hostess brought a huge coloring book for my kids and box of crayons. Crayons had hair in it and coloring book was all colored. She also told me there was no kids menu. 

Waiter gave my salad to wrong person at our table. He took forever to bring wine. He never brought Etta sauce asked for. 

Food tasted horrible and like it was frozen and warmed up. Bread was so salty you couldn't even handle the. Taste. Would never go back."}
{"text":"This was the first time I ordered from here ...and I have to say it was horrible asked for rare steak and got well done and delivery time was horrible. 2 1/2 hours had to call them 3 or 4 times and they said the driver will be there in 5 minutes well that was a lie. I will never eat there again, by the time I recieved our food it was cold and very unhappy with the whole meal and the way it was derived, the driver even had our food sitting on someone else Pizza, hope that poor guy enjoyed his smashed pizza."}
{"text":"This was an interesting find. My friends had ordered take out and really liked it, so they wanted to try dining in. When we first arrived, they placed us in the dining area, but the guys wanted to be closer to the TVs, more in the middle of the restaurant and closer to the bar (figures!). The waitress did not mind us moving at all. 

I checked in here on Yelp and had a free appetizer to redeem - hooray! We ordered the pizza fries and an additional pesto stuffed cheese. The fries were good but in the middle, a little soggy - only because there is so much cheese/toppings/sauce on it. Don't get me wrong, we ate it all up! The pesto stuffed cheese was excellent and we almost ordered more.

It takes a lot for a salad to WOW me but their Mediterranean salad was really tasty!! It was the perfect addition to our two pizzas: meat lovers and a margherita. Honestly, my mouth is watering just writing this review again. I imagine that we'll go back! Their menu had fun spins on classic Italian and Pizza shop items, yet still offered the classics.

They also have a Cigar Bar, and I know the guys would have loved to check it out, but we just weren't up for it that night. As we started to leave, more people started to come in which was nice to see. I was a little worried when the big place wasn't so filled at the start of our meal. I hope this place sticks around!"}
{"text":"This place has fantastic Italian food.  I've been looking for great pasta sauces for years in Las Vegas and this place delivers.  The evening we went it was a bit quiet but we had one of the house specialties - Eggplant Rollatini and it was delicious.  Our server Gera was so friendly and accommodating.  She educated us on the menu and was fantastic.  If you're looking for great Italian food, please give this place a try.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Had the rose' sauce on pasta with Caesar salad.  Great beer selection too. Our waitress was very attentive, friendly and fast.  We saw the pizza go by and it looked amazing.  We were visiting family in the area and liked the location.  Close to Vegas but less traffic and prices were lower, although the food was better than any we tried in Las Vegas.   We will return!"}
{"text":"My first time ordering from sauce and It was great!!!! I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with a salad and the Chocolate cake.... it was super delicious. The cake was the perfect moisture and so chocolaty. The burger was perfectly well done. The delivery did take some time (1 1/2 hours after ordering on eat) but it ended up being worth it. Good job guys!!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and the food has always been delicious. We have tries the appetizers and entrees. The portions are large. The staff is both friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"A little disappointed with this restaurant. We called ahead of time to confirm reservations and vegan friendly meals. When we arrive the waitress had no idea if they even served vegan and gluten free options. She basically blew us off and since my mom has celiac it was pertinent we had celiac friendly meals. The chef has posted all over social media that this place is friendly. The end of it all we left very disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered (through grubhub) for delivery. These people definitely know what they're doing when it comes to customer service. The delivery driver was here at the exact time quoted.  He made sure everything was included before he left. The food is really good actually. I say actually because with grubhub restaurants I've noticed you typically are just paying for the convenience.  The homemade pesto dipping sauce was great. Minestrone soup was on point and the chicken Marsala was bomb. They actually wrapped it all in plastic to keep it from leaking and it stayed hot as hell. They include a letter describing their intentions as a company, and are more than willing to accept fault if there are any issues.  I appreciate that almost more than anything. This place is definitely on my short list every time from here on out. I suggest anyone to give it a go."}
{"text":"A wise man once said, \"Sacred cows make the best hamburgers\". What does that have to do with the Sauce restaurant you ask? Probably nothing.

Sauce is an interesting place. What kinda stuck out in my head was that this is one of the few restaurants with a bar, that does not have any video poker machines. The only other restaurant that I think of that does this is Nacho Daddy.

I came during the Walking Dead party, and let me tell you, it was Packed!! They were really understaffed that day. It looked like the staff were trying their hardest, but they were totally overwhelmed. It was like a survivor vs a herd of walkers, it was brutal. What also didn't help was the fact that they didn't have enough POS systems. I sat at the bar and saw only 1. So when people were closing out, there would be a line of bartenders waiting to use the machine.

I was there for 3 hours, and I ordered 3 items, and it took that long to receive them. I wasn't too thrilled about what came out. 

Ordered the pepperoni and cheese bites, basically their version of mozzarella sticks, but with pepperoni stuffed inside. OK, it was in that cold to lukewarm stage. The cheese had solidified, and the crust outside was sorta tough. The pepperoni didn't have a really strong taste as well. The tomato sauce on the outside was cold, and so was their garlic cream sauce. But, I thought the cream sauce tasted pretty good.

Next came the tomato and mozzarella bake. This came out at slightly higher than room temperature. I thought that it could have been baked longer, or at least broiled because it tasted more like a salad than anything else. The dressing they used was pretty good.

Finally the panini came out. Again, it was cold. The bread should have been brushed with butter before it was pressed because it was dry. The chicken was cooked nicely, and the bacon and avocado tasted OK, but it was a pretty boring sandwich. Maybe it could have tasted better if it was hot, I don't know. The mixed green salad was pretty good. I thought the greens could have been more crisp, but the dressing was very good.

So the name of the restaurant matches the food. The sauces and dressings are the stars here. I know I came during a pretty crazy time, so maybe the food could have tasted better if it was hot. I hear that any other day except for Walking Dead days, the service is pretty normal. I might come back, maybe!"}
{"text":"I'll just start out by saying I haven't had a bad meal here yet...seems like Sauce is either hit or miss with a lot of people. I think their \"get sauced\" pasta entrees are excellent, who doesn't want to build their own pasta meal? Some people are picky when it comes to what they want put on their pasta (i.e., my wife, my family...). My dad would love this place, we were at Carrabas one time and he wanted fettuccine Alfredo with Italian sausage...they waiter looked at him like he had two heads. Anywho, pick your  type of pasta, pick a sauce (my favorites are the meaty Bolognese or the creamy Rose), and then various veggie toppings and meat toppings (their meatballs are really good, moist and flavorful).

So, we've agreed the Pasta's good here...But, I really wanted to try Sauce's pizza on my next visit. Just so happens, the wife wanted to come here for a sort of belated birthday lunch. Cool.

Boy, lunchtime on a Sunday at Sauce was pretty dead, I think our party was the only ones there...anyway, perusing the menu I saw something called the Italian Chimichanga, our waitress said it was new item on the menu. I know I came here with every intention of trying their pizza, but I couldn't pass this up. A giant deep-fried burrito stuffed with sausage, meatballs, ham, mushrooms and cheese. Then topped with a marinara and pesto sauce (to emulate red and green enchilada sauces), and sprinkled with Feta cheese (I guess to look like Queso fresco?). Sounds interesting, right? It was delicious, kind of like a less doughy Stromboli or calzone. As far as apps, we had the Mac and cheese balls (also new on menu, crispy fried and topped withe combo of marinara and alfredo sauce), pretty good...and the Garlic knots, tossed with olive oil, garlic and Parmesan cheese, yum.

I would've gave Sauce another star, but dang it, I have still yet to try their pizza!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how can anyone give more than a 1 star here. Saw the reviews and decided to try. My God you're so off!!! Order 1/2 marguerita 1/2 pepperoni. The Marguerita had some kind of cheese on top and the sauce was bitter all over. The basil ... I can't even describe this half. The other half had the same bitter sauce with muzzarela cheese that cover the taste a little. You can count the slices of pepperoni on the pizza in one hand. 

Overall NEVER again. 

They do not know how to make a pizza and I think the reviews were fake.

Bad bad bad quality work.

Disgusting!!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice happy hour and a good atmosphere.  My only let down was the food,  I paid almost $20 for shrimp scampi that was the worst I've ever had.  The sauce was ok, but the shrimp was tough and flavorless.  I couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"Huge building, no customers. Friendly waiter. Tomato bisque was basically marinara sauce. Gross. My friend ordered the salad which looked much better. We ordered the garlic knots, though tasty and fresh we ordered them during happy hour but was charged full price. My friend and I both ordered the build your own pasta. Both were pretty tasty however 16.50 a plate??? Way over priced."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here many many times. An the delivery time is always very long. How ever when they exceeded passed their ridiculous 90min delivery time an I requested my money back or to cancel they refused to do so. I put in my order at 7:50 an was told it went out for delivery at 8:31. It is now 9:52 and still no food. I am very displeased with their customer service in dealing with this matter. Restaurants should know how to operate when it is busy but I guess they can not. The fact that they lied saying my order went out is crazy! Thumbs waaaaaay down on that one. They offered me a free app next time I ordered. But I'd rather never order from them again."}
{"text":"We've been here twice after being convinced by RAVE reviews from friends of ours... and it's just not that good.
The bruschetta is pretty good. The meatballs were tasty.
The garlic knots were extremely undercooked inside and slightly burnt on the outside. I actually LIKE my breads a little undercooked... but this was to the extent that there was no taste other than 'raw dough'. This was after waiting nearly 30 minutes for appetizers in the middle of the afternoon in an empty restaurant.
The alfredo sauce tastes like warmed cream with no seasoning and is the same consistency you'd get if you actually just poured un-reduced cream cream over noodles.
The tortellini were so overcooked they were actually half dissolved in the sauce (all 5 of them we managed to find in the mountain of crushed tomatoes).
The chicken pesto panini was... just awful. The chicken was burnt and rubbery with no seasoning whatsoever on mediocre, half-toasted bread.
The spaghetti and meatballs was pretty okay.

Service was AWFUL. We were there over two hours for 4 people to eat while there were perhaps 10 customers and we were so starved by the time we got anything that we opted to eat food we didn't like rather than wait another 90 minutes for something else.
The staff could be over-heard laughing about how \"drunk\" a patron at the bar was.
I was curious about their deserts but not willing to wait long enough to find out if they were as disappointing as everything else.

The establishment itself is clean and seems well maintained."}
{"text":"I tried to call and order dinner and was put on hold for five minutes. I went online and placed an order at 6:23 PM. It is now 9:17. No food. I called back at 8:00 and was told my food would be here any minute. They were \"swamped,\" but my order had gone out. I called back at 8:23 and was put on hold and then disconnected. I called back at 8:37 and was put on hold while someone went to get the manager. The phone came back on and I could hear the kitchen staff; someone was talking about a $700+ car payment and someone else was in the background saying not to tell any more customers how long their meals would be. After ten minutes of that, I called from a different phone. No one answered. 

Never again. I teach at two local colleges, and I will tell everyone I meet not to EVER order food from Sauce. EVERYONE. I am livid. If my credit card has been charged, I will file fraud charges. 

The only reason there's even one star is that I cannot submit the review without giving at least one.

About twenty minutes after posting this review, I miraculously got through to the manager. I am ashamed to admit that I yelled at her. But I was in the hospitality business for over thirty years--I grew up in it, in fact. And I must say that her attempts to excuse the repeated brush-offs by saying that they were \"swamped\" (whatever happened to \"in the weeds\"?) just made me angrier. 

The manager did offer to \"make it up to me,\" but I cannot see how that could be done. A free meal does not make up for treating customers like they're stupid. When you repeatedly misrepresent the situation, you're lying. And when you're lying, you're telling the other person that you believe they're stupid enough to fall for whatever bull you feel like feeding them. 

Instead of dinner, I mean."}
{"text":"Everything I had was delish. I had house salad and sm white pizza. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Food was good. Large portions, a bit pricey, but good quality food. 

We had spinach & artichoke dip, Caesar salads, open faced meatball sandwich, and the cheese ravioli with rose sauce. Everything was delicious. 

Service was fairly good. The place is very large, and primarily empty when we went."}
{"text":"This place is CLOSED permanently. Locked up with a chain on the door. Really slow service."}
{"text":"Nice looking very elegant but I felt I was on a ghost town not to many people they really need some more advertising I only try the desserts not bad but not a fan either I recommended if you like to just relax with your partner and not have to many people around"}
{"text":"Came in the second time for Happy Hour.  Spent $10 on a $25 certificate on restaurant.com

Told Bartender/waiter 3 times I had the certificate.  He said we will apply at the end.
You have to order $50 to use the certificate.  Ordered a couple things more than I would have to comply.

Go to check out manager says can't use it for Happy Hour.  We will see which is less regular price less certificate or happy hour.  It was $11 less regular price less certificate.  Since I spent $10 I save a whole $1 and got things I would not have.

I was clear from beginning I had coupon and I was a prior customer.

$11 for 2 small crab cakes that were very fishy.  Pepperoni cheese bites overdone.  Just not that great and pretty expensive.  Pizza was okay (would not have ordered one to go to get to $50) $7.50 for a beer.

Guess what.  I won't be back. There are some great happy hour deals out there, this just isn't it."}
{"text":"First impression, we pull up at 1:30 on a Sunday afternoon with several football games being played so you would expect a good size crowd. There was barely any cars in the parking lot and you could hear a pin drop in the place. My wife said this is not a good sign. We decided that since we drove 30 minutes to come here we would stay. We ordered 3 items to share, chicken wings mild charred, pepperoni stuffed fried cheese and a personal pizza. The food did take a long time to come out. The wings were not charred so we sent them back to get charred. They were good once we tried them. The fried cheese was good but wifey doesn't like pesto which they were covered in. A little easier on the sauce on those and they would be perfect. The pizza while greasy had good crust and tasted good. Overall we are glad we stayed, would like to see the place a little busier, this was our first time so maybe just hit an odd time. We will come back as the menu is quite interesting!!"}
{"text":"Honestly the worst take out I've ever had. Ever time we try to give them another chance for take out it comes close to two hours late and the food is soggy and/or bland. 



You're better off going to Angelina's Pizzeria where food does arrive fresh and is close to authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here, and stopped here on whim. The location is a little hidden on the backside of the Galleria Mall. We stopped in for happy hour and ordered the garlic knots and the pepperoni stuffed fried cheese to start. We loved both of them. For entrees we ordered the Eggplant Rollatini and Italian Chimichanga. I was a little skeptical with Italia Chimi, but once again loved it. Service was great. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Rating based on 2 delivery orders.. First time was totally a 1-2 star experience. Dry rubbery chicken, flavorless pasta... This 2nd time was great, 4-5 star even. Tried their 97.5 combo based on them being their popular items and figure if they're actually good then that could redeem my first bad experience. Chimichanga was a nice fusion item. I don't see how some consider it filling enough for 3 people.. Decent size for one person though. The pesto pasta was good, as good as anything my dad would make (half Italian). Only gave one meatball despite the description saying meatballs, it was good so was disappointed they only gave one. Wings were different.. Good but not what I was expecting.

As for service.. Both times the delivery has taken longer than expected (90 minutes turned into 110 min or so and we don't live that far). The box the pasta came in was plastic wrapped and smashed in, leaving sauce in-between the box and plastic wrap. Was able to open without a huge mess but still something they need to consider during deliveries. If I recall I had the same issue the first order as well. New to go containers for the pasta maybe or just try to keep the pasta boxes on top if possible...

Overall, I think I might try it again and hope anyone who had a bad experience does the same."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Wonderful happy hour! And exquisite service! I definitely recommend sitting at the bar with Chris! I highly recommend the charred wings, garlic knots, spinach dip, fried cheese with pepperoni, as well as the donuts for dessert!"}

Between the staff
The food
The owners
It's perfect. 
I've had everything from apps to full blown meals and dessert
I recommend the garlic knots and fried and charred wings
The chimichanga or chicken parm
And the New York style cheese cake
You can't go wrong guys!!!"}
{"text":"The service here was great. I think the server was Selina - very pretty! We got a couple custom things from the menu and she totally made it happen. Sometime people who ask for specific things get the cold shoulder son the server but not Selina, this chick made it happen! They do delivery all over the valley and will do their best to make you (the customer) happy. Gotta love that =)"}
{"text":"Definitely won't be coming back. We came in to celebrate a friends birthday. We ordered the Caesar salad- dressing tasted like mayo :/,  fried calamari appetizer- over cooked, the garlic knots- tasted decent, but we waited 30 minutes for the \"dough to rise\"(?), pineapple and prosciutto pizza- gross, cardboard tasting crust, and the meat lovers pizza- gross, but not as bad as the other pizza. 
The service was awful, and our waitress had ZERO customer service skills."}
{"text":"So sad that this place is always so dead inside, the food is GREAT!!!!   have had a few various things on the menu, and have never been disappointed!  Give this place a try, despite the empty parking lot!!!!  its worth it!"}
{"text":"The pizza was actually pretty good.  Good sauce, cheese and great dough.  The entire service experience was terrible.  It took an hour and 53 minutes for delivery when 45-60 was promised.  I tried to call and cancel and the line said it was dead, 4 times.  

The delivery guy finally showed up and couldn't find the house.  It's pretty simple, drive down the street with the name on it. Conversations with him were brutal. I walked outside and saw him circling down the street and called him to direct him.   

He got out of the car, asked me to sign and had no pen.  I took the pizza and started to walk away and he said, \"what about a tip???!!!!\".  I said with a $10 delivery and a 2 hour wait, I would hope that the store would give him some tip.  She said, nope.  

A tip is a privilege for good service,  not a given.  I have NEVER not tipped someone. Tonight was a first."}
{"text":"Got the Neapolitan Pizza it was very good!!  Lots of cheese, just like i like it!!  the only problem I had is that the delivery time was very long!  it was more than an hour from order to delivery, living 1 mile from the restaurant.  I will be back, but i may just pick up form the restaurant next time."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Brandon the owner is extremely personable and is a great conversationalist. Chris is an amazing bartender and very friendly. The manager whose name escapes me is also sweet. Must try the artichoke dip and their version of the mozzarella sticks."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the food was not awful.  It was okay but nothing spectacular.  We ordered 2 appetizers and 3 entrees.  My review is primarily on an incident that happened and the reaction and follow up of the restaurant.  We had just been served our entrees and I reached down to grab my napkin from my lap when I noticed a little (and by little, I mean huge)  something crawling up my leg.  I will be honest... I don't do bugs at all.  And when I am dining and there is one just nonchalantly crawling up my leg, well.... All 3 of us jumped up and quickly exited the booth.  I went to the bathroom because I was paranoid enough to believe that it had ended up in my purse when I swept it off my leg.  My friends had asked before I left if I wanted to go (which is what I should have done) or stay.  I chose stay because I knew I would have to pay for this meal either way and I may as well try to eat. When I came back, my friends had moved to a new table and told me they told one of the servers but not ours.  When our server came back (finally) we told her what had happened and she was apologetic but then disappeared for forever again.  

I don't know about you but once I have a cockroach on me, I kind of lose my appetite.  So I picked at my food and asked for a box.  The box never came... it was probably hiding with the appetizer plates we were told were coming but never came.  Right before she gave us our check, my buggy little friend decided to make another appearance in the middle of the floor.  At this point, enough is enough.  The server grabbed a napkin and quickly got it off the floor then proceeded to give us our check.  My friend checked to see if anything had been done for the trouble of having a cockroach crawl up my leg and it hadn't.  So we asked for something to be done.  Yes, the manager took off a percentage.  It didn't even take off the price of my meal.  To me, that was a bit of a slap in the face since even the server saw the little critter on their floor.  

I don't think I ever saw another review about a bug problem so this may be a fluke thing. I mean, we live in the desert and there are roaches.   However, the restaurant had 4 other tables filled and we still couldn't get anyone to throw us a box or appetizer plates and there was easily 3 servers, that in and of itself made me not want to return.  You add the little friend that crawled up my leg and it is kind of a done deal that I won't be returning.  Hope you have a better experience!"}
{"text":"Whoever owns this place needs to take a hard look at their management. I have been here 4 times because the food is good, but the last time it was terrible so I have not been back. Maybe they had a bad chef one night? Who knows. But, I have only gotten one good server here and everyone else was a complete disaster. I mean the waiter was swearing when he was talking to us! And the one time I saw a manager he was on his phone the entire time and did not seem to be doing anything to watch what the employees were doing. One time when I went I practically had to wave my arms like a lunatic to get the waitress to come over. And there was not even anyone in the restaurant. One of the other waitresses brought us the check before we were even done eating. Obviously, she does not realize that she could have made a higher tip if we would have had more wine or dessert. The three good times, the food was so good I just kept coming back. I just can't imagine this place will survive because there is nobody ever in there. This is sad, because I really liked the place and would have gone there a lot. Hopefully the bad reviews that they are getting will get them to fix things."}
{"text":"Nice laid back atmosphere good food friendly staff the wife and I will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I just had the chicken parmesan with angel hair and it is by far the best chicken parm that I have had in Las Vegas! The portion size is huge! Sauce is behind the Galleria Mall and should be tried by every Italian food lover."}
{"text":"Everything I've ordered has been perfection. 

My first comment is they're always early for delivery. They guestimate usually am hour delivery time and each time it's been about 30 minutes. Food faster than I expected? Yes please. 

The fact they have aranchini at ALL surprised me but they definitely didn't disappoint. Perfectly crisp on the outside and not oily, cheesy meat delisiousness on the inside. An order comes with 4 and some marinera for dipping. I'll just ask for extra marinera next time cuz I'm a sucker for sauce. 

Next the Mediterranean salad. A salad is a salad right? No. Lots of lettuce and huge pieces of grilled chicken. I'm talking charcoal grilled that you can taste a bit of char on. Yeah. Salad's sounding pretty good now isn't it carnivores? My one and only \"complaint\" would be the kamata olives. No flavor, more like olive shaped salt vessels but I know they don't make the olives so they get a pass on that. I also like that it's served with cucumber salad dressing instead of a traditional vinaigrette. With artichokes and olives the cool cucumber dressing was a much better option. 

The truffle pizza. Not for the faint of heart. Seriously. It's a no sauce pizza but worry not, it's delicious none the less. Cheese on cheese, prociutto, roasted garlic so it's packed with flavor. HOWEVER. It is SALTY. one of the cheeses is fontina which in itself is salty, plus prociutto, salty cured ham, roasted garlic PLUS the richness of truffle oil, it's not a pizza that you can sit down an eat the entire thing in one sitting. My roommate tried. The flavors are great but intense so if you're determined to eat the whole thing asap I'd recommend a side of marinera or (dare I say it?) Even ranch will cut some of the intensity so you can stuff yourself until you explode. 

Next we ordered a large pizza with Alfredo sauce as the base with tomatoes and mushrooms. I had to call and make sure the adjustments I made when ordering online went through and the woman who answered was a bit surprised I wanted Alfredo sauce instead of marinera (blasphemy, I know) but they made it just the way we asked and it was delicious. Their Alfredo sauce isn't overwhelmingly garlic which is great cuz most places go overboard with it, and it was nice they used sliced tomatoes instead of diced cuz diced ones just fall off. Perfect thin crust. That pizza barely made it to the next day. 

The last pizza we ordered from them was simple. We had ordered fancy, we had ordered \"custom made\" so I thought why not go for the basic? I wanted to see how they do pizza when it's simple and no adjustments made. That pizza was the best. I ordered their basic pizza which had crushed tomatoes in lieu of sauce (I KNOW), cheese and fresh basil strips. The tomatoes were definitely not canned and I think they stew them themselves or at least marinate them in awesome because they were packed with delicious garlic flavor. There was enough cheese to coat it but not so much that the lack of sauce became a downfall and the fresh basil strips were the perfect seasoning. Simple can in fact be perfection my friends. Highly recommend taking the easy route. 

Another easy option that earned good points with me was their \"side\" salad. They call it the mixed greens with an option for a half or full order. Ordered the half and it was still huge. What I enjoyed most was they used darker greens instead of the traditional romaine. There was lots of spinach and some purple leaf I couldn't recognize (not purple cabage), cucumbers, big pieces of red onion (great if you wanna remove them) and tomato. It comes with basalmic vinaigrette which was just sweet enough without being too sweet and they provided enough to actually coat the whole salad. Definite win.  

Last and certainly not least, the eggplant parmesean. After being a vegetarian for many years eggplant has become a favorite food and it's always hard to order it somewhere and expect to be satisfied. And yet I was. Perfectly crisp outside, soft enough to chew through easily but not so soft it was mush, just enough marinera that they didn't drown and enough cheese to placate any italian. It's served with angel hair pasta with marinera and basil. I normally don't like angel hair because it's so thin it tends to stick together like a clump of play dough pasta but it really wasn't stuck together at all. It also comes with some kind of bread, clearly homemade, which was a bit dense so I did without. 

All in all I love everything they've made me. I guarantee I will order from them again and I'm definitely gonna try and deversify my orders so I can get the best of everything. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"The boy and I couldn't decide where to eat on our way to a movie, so I pulled up my trusty yelp app and this was nearby. We read the reviews and decided to give it a try as the 2&3 star reviews didn't seem to be terribly bad. 

The building is large and adequate for family dining, group gatherings, bar stops and billiards (I only saw one table, but didn't really take a good look). The lay out is somewhat long, but the kitchen seems to be centrally located making an easy pass for the wait staff. 

I believe our server was Matt? Hopefully I am right. He was very pleasant, prompt and we had great service. The water glasses are huge and we didn't have to wait for any refills. 

The boy went with his tried and true chicken parmesan. He enjoyed his meal, indicated it had good flavor and was a decent serving (especially considering he is usually a bottomless pit) and he actually had food left on the plate when we were finished! 

I had a half salad and a soup. The salad was mixed greens and usually comes with red onion and tomatoes. I opted for no tomatoes and extra red onion. The house dressing is a vinaigrette, which was pretty nice. It had just a hint of sweet to cut through the acidity and flavors blended very well. 

I forget the soup name, but it was the cream sauce with sausage, potatoes and kale. I originally didn't know what I wanted and asked Matt for his opinion - he said that soup was his favorite. I can definitely see why, as it was fantastic! Great flavor and good portion size as well. I felt it was a little light on potatoes and a little heavy on kale, but that might just be me. They also serve warm bread with dippings (oil and balsamic?). I wish it would have come with butter, too. I'm sure I could have asked for butter, but I decided to wait - the bread goes great dipped in the soup! 

Overall, it's a decent place that we would go to again. Unfortunately it was a little pricey for us to consider it a frequent stop but it is a welcome addition to the available foods in the area. Although the chicken parmesan was a little more than we're used to paying for, we discussed that the flavor and portion size does make up for that aspect."}
{"text":"I wanted to leave as soon as I walked in the door and I wish I would have listened to my inner voice. Only our table, and 2 others at 12:30, so obviously not busy for lunch. Waited a long, long time for our food. As did the table behind us, I heard the waitress apologizing for how long it took, she told them she was happy they weren't on their lunch hour, so maybe not a good place to go for lunch if you're working. 

My open-faced meatball sandwich was so-so. The ''bun'' or bread underneath it was burnt to a crisp, I wasn't even able to cut through it with a fork. The meatballs were lack luster and I only ate half of the sandwich. My daughter said her entree, chicken and avocado panini, was just okay. 

We won't go back. Service was fine, food was bland and even with a buy1get1 free coupon it was still almost $20 for lunch. Frankly, Olive Garden is much better. Their food at least has taste."}
{"text":"I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Salad (1/2). It was HUGE. And delicious. They definitely don't skip on all the toppings. 

I'll definitely order through Yelp again!"}
{"text":"Great Italian place on the far side of the rim of the Galleria mall. Really good Italian,  but I don't know how long they will last,nobody can find them. We went for lunch only one other person there ,but wait staff was excellent as well as  our food. Try it ,you won't be  disappointed."}
{"text":"We have had Sauce delivered on several occasions... But, have never eaten at the restaurant. We were quite happy with the food and the delivery time until our last order. Not only had the menu changed, but the food wasn't nearly as tasty. We may give them another shot... But, if things continue as they were, we will NOT eat from there again."}
{"text":"The spaghetti and meatballs is outstanding! My husband ordered the lasagna and inhaled it! Good food, service off to a slow start. This place just needs to be discovered!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for me and the kids. Two hours later, our meal arrived. I called to inquire after about an hour. Was told that the delivery was on the way. Minutes later received a call that it was being fired and would be delivered soon. Do you think it was on the house? Nope. Just got a piece of cheesecake and  20% coupon. Not good enough. 
Now, let's talk food. The meatball \"panini\" was a piece of French bread with a bland/acidic sauce. The meatballs were overcooked and dry. Not a pleasant experience. The pizza sauce was also watery and bland. You'd think that a place called \"Sauce\" would have figured it out by now. Not so."}
{"text":"We stopped by on a Tuesday evening for dinner. There wasn't much going on so we were seated quickly.

The restaurant itself is nice and clean. It's large so the bar area is a good distance from the dining room area.

Our server was exceedingly friendly and very courteous. Keep in mind though, we were one of only three other tables there. I'd imagine the effort would still be there, but busy is busy.

We ordered their chicken parmesan and eggplant parmesan. Both dishes tasted very well prepared. Slightly expensive at $14.50 and $13 respectively, but definitely tasted good.

Overall, you will probably have a pleasant dining experience here. They have other activities, such as karaoke and live music, as well, so that might be enjoyable."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on trivia night. Though we didn't participate in trivia, it seemed like fun. The lighting in the dining room was very dark, made it hard to see the menu. The service wasn't great but the food was fantastic. The woman who seated us recommended the buffalo wings, which were the best I've had sense moving to Vegas. We shared a Caesar salad and the shrimp scampi. They split the plates for us which was very nice. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Great food great service Jason was very good server he came back a couple times to check on us ."}
{"text":"We really like this restaurant.  The lasagna is the best.  Happy hour Long Island, also good and cheap.  Jason, the waiter, was great."}
{"text":"Confusing, the place was dead at around 130pm on a Saturday. I had just come from the mall which was an absolute zoo of people so I thought this place would be packed. Honestly, I don't know why they're not because their food is good! I had a Tuscan Chicken panini sandwich and it was very tasty, large portion and your choice of fries or a side salad...additional cost for Caesar or Mediterranean. For that, and two mixed drinks from the bar, it was around $25. Their prices are very reasonable on pizzas, sandwiches, salads and appetizers. Try them out!"}
{"text":"For sandwhiches and bar food, this place is great.  Party of four and we all loved it.  We all had cheesesteaks which came with fries, $8 each.  Calamari with our free yelp check in, normally $11.  Garlic knots which were happy hour for $3  Wings, $5.50 and a few beers (domestic $4.00 for 24 oz).  We were one of two groups in the place.  Not busy at all. Hope they stay open.  Will be back.  Calamari was one of the best we've had in town."}
{"text":"Hey Sauce! 
I heard some friends talking about how great your pizza was so I took the wife out to your restaurant last night to give it a try. I thought I'd provide you with our feedback as I have a feeling many other people may be feeling the same way we did about our experience. Lets start off with the good, the pizza was really good, our server was really good, the price of the food was decent, but that's kind of where it ends. Our first real impression of the place was when we were handed our menu's, both our menu's were beyond greasy and dirty and had food stuck to them, they were dingy/had bent corners and some of the paper had ripped off both of the menus this is a sign that nobody cares to wipe down the menus, and if nobody cares to even wipe down the menus it makes me wonder what else do they not wipe down regularly. When sitting around and taking in the whole atmosphere of the place, we felt it was a little dark and the restaurant as a whole needed to be wiped down. The garlic knots were really good, I still have mixed feelings about them, because most places that sell garlic knots dust them in parmesan cheese powder and some sort of garlic powder, and that's what I was kind of expecting here, but here I got fresh parmesan cheese and fresh chunks of garlic on top, don't get me wrong fresh is great but it was an ongoing battle to keep the garlic chucks and parmesan on top of the knot while eating it, where as if it were the parmesan powder I feel it would have stuck better and not have been so much work. The sauce that came with the garlic knots was amazing. Normally I like my garlic knots dipped in ranch, but I definitely liked your sauce over ranch last night. As far as your pizza goes it's really good. Let me start by saying I haven't found a place in the Vegas area that does pizza like yours, the thickness of the dough etc. We are transplants from California a little over a year ago and we've been on the hunt for a pizza with a crust like that. That's how 90% of all pizza places are in Southern California do it so that's what we've grown to like. Everything we have tried out here has seemed to try to spin off of New York thin style crust, so thank you for being a breath of fresh air for that. The pizza was hot when it came out as it should have, but for the life of me every slice I ate all the toppings would slide right off the crust, i felt like i might as well be eating a pizza casserole lol I thought that maybe everything was just too hot, but from the time I ate my first slice to the time I ate the last one, a good 15 minutes had passed and still the same situation. In regards to your soda glasses, you are using Samuel Adams pint glasses I think they were, these things were very frustrating, first of all not everyone likes beer and if you want to attract more families to your restaurant having every soda glass be a beer pint isn't very family friendly, but the most annoying part is every time I had a refill (at least 3 times) the ice was stuck in that center section and would drop to the bottom of the glass, just something to think about. Over all I liked the food, but all the other issues combined really make me want to rate you as 2 out of 5 stars. I was really hoping your restaurant would be added as a \"usual place\" for my wife and I but I think it's going to be in the once in a blue moon category. I hope business continues to grow for you guys and that you can dial down these little things and thrive as a business. Thanks again for the good food last night and good luck!"}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised by Sauce.  We made a wrong turn and decided to stop for dinner.  I had the Lasagne Bolognese--it was really good.  Their Bolognese is made with Italian sausage, hamburger, prosciutto and bacon.  It's really great!  The garlic knots are also tasty.  Give it a try if you love Italian."}
{"text":"Best Italian food I've had in Henderson by far! Bartenders are friendly and inviting and the atmosphere is great even to bring the kids too. I've eaten here a few times and am in love with the chicken parm and build your own pasta. I first heard about this place because it's the only restaurant that will deliver to my house. I found out they will deliver anywhere in Las Vegas and not many places do that. I recommend going in and trying it for urself."}
{"text":"Wow 1 server/hostess/bus person for lunch this afternoon.  Well I was warned that the service sucked prior to going. The food was good, but $4 extra for only 3 shrimp that weren't deveined in my daughter's pasta...and only one person working because the facility is waiting for their gaming license. I will never go there again. With that area of town having so many places available, you can skip this one."}
{"text":"I went to Sauce on Dec 28th to watch the football game.. Had a great time.. Ordered a pizza. The bartender Kamie was really nice. Fun to hang out with, Took great care of me while I Was there.  Got my food out quick.. Had a great time!!"}
{"text":"The shrimp dishes are to die for.  The place is gorgeous and the service is fast (maybe because they're not  that busy yet).  Ask to talk to Brandon or Rich.  It doesn't matter about what.  Those guys are hilarious."}
{"text":"Food is usually good but delivery always takes at least an hour and a half, even on tuesday nights.."}
{"text":"I really do like this place however we went to take family here tonight and had a pretty bad experience. Place was empty except for some hooligans making terrible noise at the bar we were the only people in the restaurant. They cranked up music so we couldnt hear the noisy bar people but it was too loud. Food was good as always but then it came time to pay. They refused my groupon because they said I ordered a special item. They also assured me that I would save way more money if I paid the full price. Got home and looked at TOS of groupon and they lied about that and then calculated my price w groupon...they lied about paying full price would be cheaper as well. I can see the owners try really hard with these place but it sounds like they have hired some incompetent people. That stunt they pulled tonight cost them a serious customer. Such a shame......"}
{"text":"I think this is a nice addition to Italian restaurants in Henderson. The service was five stars as was the price. The food overall was significantly above average (I'd go back here before the overpriced chain Olive Garden), but the decor was actually really distracting and odd. From the awkward glass partition separating the bar (but not enough to not be able to hear the loud drunk people chatting at the bar). There's also a large awkward air conditioning (maybe?) tube that hangs awkwardly from the ceiling. That's just a few of the distracting decor issues we laughers about. Overall a good experience, but could use some attention to the appearance of their restaurant. We will definitely come back for the food."}
{"text":"We visited here on a quiet
Friday afternoon. Had no trouble finding it and our server, Jason, was great, attentive and friendly without hovering. The garlic knots were good and the entrees were awesome! I had shrimp scampi- the sauce was great and the shrimp were perfectly cooked. My husband had lasagne, which he loved. We will gladly visit again the next time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"The cannoli was good but sadly that's the best I can say. Figured for a $10 delivery fee, should be good so thought I'd give it a try.

Have tried pizza all over the world and definitely would rank this one in the bottom tier, sorry but wasn't even good.

To top things off, it took 1 hour, 45 minutes for delivery. I checked in 1 hour in and was told the driver was on the way, 45 minutes later he shows up.

Normally give a place two tries before writing it off but not even going to do them that courtesy, service your clients or someone else will!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, at best. I ordered an appetizer & it just okay. Nothing special. I returned that & asked tiramisu which was also \"eh\".  I don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"New business opened behind the Galleria Mall. Had a couple different pasta dishes - the Chicken Parm was amazing and I love their creamy pesto over tortilini. Drinks are reasonable and happy hour is great. Small selection but very generous servings. The service is great - very friendly and down to earth atmosphere. Hoping they last. Its a nice place to go, relax and have a couple drinks."}
{"text":"Quick review: Served 15 min menu in 45and served expired beer. Do not go here.

Long review: This is by far one of the worst dining experiences I've had to endure. The hostess was wearing a Minions tshirt and waited 3 or 4 minutes after making eye contact to greet us. She asked us if we were going to eat. Not very reassuring that that needs to be asked when you walk in a RESTAURANT. She ushered us to the back room with the shades open and sat us in the most remote area of the restaurant. We were one of 2 parties in this behemoth of a restaurant. She told us our server would be out within a few minutes. After about 10 minutes of waiting she came back and took our drink order. The server showed after completing the only other table in the building to take our order. We ordered most items off of the lunch menu. The menu boasts a nice offering that the lunches will be out in 15 minutes or less. DO NOT ADVERTISE WHAT YOU CANNOT PERFORM. 45 minutes of sweating in the hottest area of the restaurant and it started coming. I will give them this, the food was good but no amount of taste can offset the level of s*** service this place has. I swear every time we asked for something they had to go in the back to make it from scratch. The salads, the ranch, heck even the water took 5 minutes to be delivery. Must have had to make all of it from scratch. The $1 miller high lifes would have been great if they didnt run out after 1 beer. The waiter just delivered me an MGD instead of asking. Even better it had expired on 9/14.  No attempt to rectify the mistake he just removed it off my bill. After this wonderful meal and losing our appetite from waiting so long we just wanted to get out. We did not argue the 15 min rule for the sake of not wanting to wait even longer. 

Make the decision on you own accord. Heed my warning though. Unless you want to be served in an untimely manner and potentially be served expired product than I would choose a better option. Check out Sunset Station across the street. Plenty of options in a timely manner served by people who care. I will be contacting management about how poor the service and experience was."}
{"text":"Food was terrible and the waitress was annoying. She kept telling us that bruschetta was pronounced some weird way \"because he great grandfather was Italian\" she was just dumb. I spent many years in Italy and she was wrong. Also the food was either horribly prepared or it was frozen and microwaved. I'm never going back!"}
{"text":"Great food!! Omg outstanding to be exact!! It's exactly what I wanted and to top it off we got $30 for $15. Cheese pizza is BOMB.. Philly cheesesteak more BOMB and the garlic knots OH MY YUMMY BOMB!!! Prices were great and they have awesome specials. The bartender was so cool and fun! They had a trivia night going on (every Monday I guess) we didn't play but everyone was having a blast! Totally kid friendly and for that I will be back with the kiddos!! Thanks guys for taking care of me!! Drove from Fiesta Station just to eat HERE and well worth it!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a meal for delivery. It was almost an hour late, there were items missing, and the entire thing was cold and disgusting.   Most of the my sauce was inside the bag, not on the entree. 

Never. Again."}
{"text":"Walked in & no greeting, 2 ladies at the bar. An employee & what appeared to be a customer, talking. Employee goes to back w/o a word & customer says seat yourself. Sat ourselves & waitress comes, we order house cab & a beer. Looking at the menu, she brings drinks & we see $1 beer for Miller @ lunch. So we pay $3 for Miller lite... We tell her Groupon & are told no lunch specials apply. Buy a $10 grilled cheese & cup of soup, instead of $6. Would've been ok but grilled cheese should not be cold & cheese should be melted. ESPECIALLY for $10. Asked for water & it came at the end of the meal. We were one of only 2 tables at 1:30 in the afternoon. Hubby says check when you get a minute & waitress come RIGHT back (incredible given the slow responses otherwise) says show me your Groupon, as I am taking a bite of my pizza. I said sure, give me a second to finish this bite. She says well your husband asked for the check. Yes, you're right he did. Why don't you set it on the table like a normal waitress would, instead of standing there looking at me while I chew. Then it's so important for you to point out it's his fault to ask for a check... good for you. Your owner/manager shouldn't wonder why the business fails. 

Terrible service & worse food. Wouldn't eat there again. Awful."}
{"text":"When my dinner was delivered tonight (via Grubhub) I received a flyer asking for reviews on Yelp. How could I say no?

I've ordered from Sauce a few times - but I've never been in person - so this is based off of quality of food delivered. Which, I can easily say, is really delicious. Chicken parm is one of my favorite dishes, and this one is one of my favorites. It's well breaded and smothered with cheese and the marinara is nice and tomato-y without too much spice or too little flavor. It's really good and always arrives warm and tasty, not soggy.

I have also ordered the garlic knots which are... amazing.

Every time I've ordered, I receive the food I wanted at a great quality and in a reasonable time frame. I like Sauce :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food lovely presentation, happy hour has decent prices, great service, ask for Jason he is the best! 

Not a fan of the garlic fries personally I would order them with out Alfredo sauce on the overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Overall my first experience was just, meh with a side of disappointment. 

Pretty much the only positive thing I will say is, the wings were different; an interesting mix of buffalo and BBQ- worth a shot to try if you haven't. 

I had the BBQ pizza, or rather everything but BBQ pizza. Seriously lacking any BBQ flavor, just the faintest hint. 

Roommate had the margherita pizza and said it wasn't that great- was lacking cheese, and I'd have to agree. 

Finally, I had the cannoli for dessert and was highly UNIMPRESSED, especially for $5.00! It was worth about $2.00 at best. Didn't taste like anything special and I'm unsure why, but it pretty much was a melted mess with a non light and flaky crust (more like hard and crunchy). Also, a HUGE part of why I wanted to try this was the combination of pistachio nuts, which it had ZERO, ZIP, NADA! 

How freaking disappointing this whole experience was. Highly overpriced, with a quality that doesn't even come close to supporting it. 

I may at some point try another item again, but not anytime soon. 

I continue my quest for the ultimate EAT24 experience. One day....one day...."}
{"text":"This building is cursed. It changes hands more then Taylor Swift changes boyfriends. That being said, I like Sauce a lot. The food is tasty and the portions are huge. My husband loves the Italian Chimichanga. It's all of your favorite Italian flavors wrapped up, deep fried, and covered with sauce. I like the make your own pasta. There's always enough for leftovers."}
{"text":"First and foremost the man that sat us at our table was dressed in his pajamas. The wait staff was pleasant and friendly. I ordered a Dr. Pepper and it was flat, not a huge deal, and got a coke instead. The bruschetta was interesting (pictured) I wouldn't order it again but it was decent. The fried calamari was good, however fried food is hard to mess up. I ordered the eggplant rollatini (pictured) it was pretty good. My girlfriend ordered the Mediterranean salad. This was absolutely disgusting, their house made creamy lemon dressing was definitely old and spoiled. We sent the entire salad back. It was not taken off of my bill. That upset me a little because we sent the entire salad back but I didn't say anything. This was just an average dining experience and I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"I am afraid that the location of Sauce Italian Bistro & Bar might be its eventual downfall. Sandwiched in the northern portion of the Galleria Mall area, there is not much of a chance for people to stumble across it. That being said, it is a very enjoyable Italian-American restaurant worth looking for.

The prices are on the higher side for a casual restaurant (average entree price around $18 I'd estimate) but the portion sizes absolutely make up for it as the entrees are easily sized for two people. The shrimp scampi pasta ($17) tasted of a higher quality than any other I've ever had at your average Italian restaurant, and the portion is large enough to have some left over for lunch the next day. 

The real star of the show for our visit was the Italian Chimichanga ($13). It is a beast of a meal that could almost feed three people in one sitting. 

Bring a map and your appetite because, even though it is out of the way compared to everything that is easily accessed in the Sunset/Stephanie area, Sauce Italian Bistro & Bar will most definitely fill you up."}
{"text":"The food was over priced for the quality and tasted just ok. The waitress was rude when when asked for separate checks.  Food took forever to come out."}
{"text":"The only thing that disappoints me about this place is that I keep forgetting it's there unless I'm actually driving by it. I need to figure out some way of making it forefront in my mind when I want pasta, 'cuz their food is really excellent. We've been twice, and both times, we just wanted to lick the plates when we were done, but we were too full to do it."}
{"text":"I've only been here once so far. The food was good. I just got a meatball sandwich and a side salad instead of fries. I was impressed that the side salad came with romaine lettuce and a tasty dressing."}
{"text":"I LOVEEEE this place!! My friends and I come here at least twice a week. Their food is amazing! TRY THE ZEPPOLIS! They are soooo good. All the people there are really nice. Donnie is the best bartender in town, he will hook you up! I love that they are constantly adding new things to their menu, one time they even let us sample their new Italian chimichanga which btw you will not be disappointed with!!! 

Don't forget 
Friday is hip pop night & SATURDAY IS LATIN NIGHT. You'll have so much fun here, trust me."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here about twice a month. It is always very slow which is surprising because their food and service is always on point. Obviously their pizza is delicious, but you really can't go wrong ordering their calzones, pasta dishes, and salads. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the place always feels pretty desolate due to the lack of customers."}
{"text":"Great prices.  Wonderful Bruchetta. I had penne with pesto  cream sauce , good portion and very flavourful. My wife has Chicken Parm on the waitress recommendation and it was excellent. 
Great service and great food. This place is a wonderful addition to Green Valley."}
{"text":"The location is going to be a struggle for this restaurant so it makes it so sad that they have chosen to start with a whimper instead of a splash. 

Edit: they never really hit their stride. We tried three times. Call us slow learners. The first time we walked out before ordering because they clearly weren't ready and hadn't dealt with the the sewer gas smell. But the third time we left because we waited for 70 minutes for food. Yeah, that was the last time."}
{"text":"I got a cheese pizza and wings and the pizza was disgusting. It tasted and looked like cheddar cheese on the pizza and tasted like cheesy sodium. It was horrific. The wings were really good, but I'd never order from here again. Terrible terrible pizza."}
{"text":"I purchased a living social coupon for Sauce and my family of four decided to give it a try late last month. Bottom line is that we will never return.  Our appetizers arrived lukewarm and tasted ok.  We had pepperoni bites - cheese sticks with pepperoni and one other non-memorable app, perhaps crab cakes.  Our food arrived after a lengthy wait of 50 minutes and only 1 of 4 dishes was correctly prepared.  My husband's dish was wrong in several ways to include having mushrooms, to which he is allergic.  The kids pizza's arrived with just cheese and no pepperoni.  The waiter was unapologetic,  it took 10 minutes to get a manager, and then it took the manager 4 tries and about 40 minutes to get our bill adjusted to remove the three incorrect meals.  No offer for reducing more of the bill was made.  The whole ordeal took over 2 hours.  The manager did give us a $25 gift certificate, which my husband promptly recycled.  We are patient customers, but this was beyond reasonable and the quality of the food was not enough to convince us to try this resteraunt again or suffer their customer service."}
{"text":"Had a Yelp deal so that was the clincher.  

The place is huge! The bar seemed busier than the dining room.

Service was good and friendly and we were seated immediately on a Saturday night. 

The food was tasty, but average for a place like this.  Similar to a Buca or an Olive Garden.  It's more pre-prepared food and not made fresh to order.  At least that's what it seemed like to me. 

Overall, OK, but again the Yelp deal is what cinched it for us.  Not sure we'd return without the  coupon."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food, great staff and awesome entertainment!!!! Great separate room for events!!!"}
{"text":"I bought a groupon so my son & I went on Monday night. We were apprehensive as the place was empty except at the bar, we heard a game being played & asked the waitress what was going on & she told us Monday nights is Trivia night at the bar everyone seemed to really be enjoying the game! She also told us of all the daily specials, which are a lot so if you go look into specials offered! We started out with the fresh tomato & mozzarella, my son ordered the Italian Chimichanga, and I ordered the lasagna EVERYTHING was so fresh & delicious, there was a wait but that's understandable, it's NOT a fast food so go with time to enjoy the food, relaxed atmosphere & the company you are in! We will definitely be back & will take family & friends, it's truly a hidden gem! I hope this establishment makes it because everything was great!"}
{"text":"Now that I have been here about 5 times, I feel safe giving these guys 4 stars. I am glad I did not judge them off the first two visits where they were still figuring out all the kinks that come with opening a new restaurant. I feel like they went from 2 stars, to 3 stars, and finally to the 4 star review. They earned it. 
Sauce is an American-Italian style bar and restaurant, semi new to the Henderson area. There are private dining areas, a bar and stage area, and of rather large size dining room. I have only ate in the dining room, however I may have to return and enjoy the bar knowing they offer a Karaoke night. 
Off top, 5 stars, every single time for service. I have never felt rushed, ignored, or had anything close to bad hospitality here. 
Food ranges from 3-5 stars. The sandwich my sister got was more pushing 2 stars. But things like the risotto balls, garlic knots, and lemon butter sauce are all up there near 5 in my opinion. The chicken tasted pre-cooked, that bothered me. If you are going to pre cook something at least season and store it properly so when you re-heat it, it does not taste rubbery, at all, ever. 
I have yet to try a steak, but the one that went passed me sure did look appetizing. 
I would say realistically this establishment is a solid 3.5 star average. 
Decent food and prices with great service and happy hours. Long hours, odd location. 
I want to see this place offer nightly specials, or incorporate some local and/or fresh ingredients. I think they could advertise to more Yelp style peeps versus local Henderson people that way. Don't get me wrong, you want the local Henderson cliental. But I can't picture anything that stands out to the REST of the city. Something I would drive across town for. 
Another year of good management and advertising could do wonders for a place like Sauce."}
{"text":"How is it this place seems to be slow?!

We ordered delivery off eat24 and it came super fast!! The guy was also super friendly and nice. I hope more people give him a big tip like we did, lord knows driving around in the heat isn't fun. Plus my food was still SO FRESH AND HOT! 

The prices seemed fair to me and the portions were great. I enjoyed everything that we ordered. 

Only thing I did not love was the type of Lettuce paired with the antipasto salad but the veggies meat and cheese were plenty and so delicious and fresh!

I highly recommend and cannot wait to dine in"}
{"text":"Overall really good. Came here on a Sunday night. A couple of new restaurant hiccups with the service. But overall a good experience.  Pasta was good and the garlic knots were a must have. Definitely going to recommend this place, especially for the price vs quality of food."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on Xmas eve. Our family had spaghetti and meatballs, shrimp scampi, a Tuscan panini/Mediterranean salad and 3 cannolis. Everything was great. Our server was Selena and she was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and decor is nice. Food is okay, sauces are strong but I've had better arancini. My biggest issue was the service. Wait staff was polite but they seem seriously understaffed. Orders for main dishes took a long while. If they fix the staffing issue there is a lot of potential for this place."}
{"text":"NFL football on and I'm listening to Casey Kasum tip hits from 1978. What is the target demographic? This isn't the only time I left due to terrible ambiance. I'll keep  giving this place a chance because of the happy hour pizza and wings. I hope they will find an identity."}
{"text":"The minestrone is soooo good!!! The food is very fresh, the staff is very friendly.  And the garlic knots are everything!!!  You must dine here!  They have line dancing on some nights as well."}
{"text":"Ordered through grub hub last night and was shocked! Very hard to find Italian food that delivers at midnight that's still good. Chicken parm, little Quattro formagii (4 cheese) pizza it had roasted garlic on it we loved it, and tomato basil soup. All came piping hot and delicious!!"}
{"text":"Ordered through bite squad for dinner the other night....food arrived hot and fresh. Had the Angel hair pasta w roasted garlic and spinach, olive oil and basil. Pasta was great! Ordered  a side of garlic knots no cheese....those drove the rating down as they tasted very processed w a yucky after taste...."}
{"text":"Love this place - literally my favorite go-to place - but has it gone out of business? They should update this listing if so!

I have called them a dozen times and tried repeatedly to order through GrubHub in 2017 but no one answers their phone, there is no voicemail activated so it rings and rings with no response, and GrubHub always says they are not delivering to them. :/

This place had literally the best burgers in Henderson. Fresh, high quality, perfectly cooked - The Sauce Burger was absolutely scrumptious. Their French Fries were also literally the best in Henderson--you cannot get simple, classic potato-y thick-cut steak fries, piping hot, slightly crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside---no stupid coatings or batter or spices, which seems to be all you can get in Henderson (usually loaded with MSG)---these had only the perfect shake of salt and pepper. Fantastic tiramisu. 

Staggeringly good cheesecakes. Delectable tomato soup with croutons. Wonderful Italian food. Decent salads. Their steaks were also fabulous, come to think of it...and they had these roasted fingerling potatoes with very light but perfect seasoning, olive oil, garlic, rosemary, sat and pepper--perfectly cooked, and some kind of light sauce for the steak. I could go on.

What the heck happened? I moved here 6 months ago for work, and this has been the only restaurant with food that rivaled other, more sophisticated cities I have lived, and also is reasonably priced.

You can get great artful \"foodie food\" in Las Vegas itself--by chefs with impressive pedigrees---but if you simply unfussy, very well-thought-out, creative, fresh, wholesome, original, carefully crafted food? Nowhere in Henderson---90% of the restaurants are chains. Most are in strip malls. Most of them have slot machines in them. Or are tacky sports bars with food that tastes like the chef was sleepwalking or had an IQ of 12. Or are laughably overpriced Italian with $22 just pretty good lasagna. Or lackluster 1960s style Chinese. And sickeningly foul Thai food (with some notable exceptions).

Disappointed and so sorry for whomever owned and ran this place. I hope they know some people deeply appreciated their restaurant (and the staff--who were sweethearts and wonderful), and will miss them."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, I mean, who doesn't like Italian food, but they leave a lot to be desired.

Let me start by saying, I am gluten free and they are NOT a gluten friendly restaurant. Most restaurants in today's day and age have quite a few items on the Gluten Menu including Italian restaurants. Sauce however, had 1 pasta and 1 sauce, they didn't even have a menu and barely knew how to handle the question of gluten free. My family ordered an appetizer (which was burnt), we paid and left. 

Sorry Sauce, but until you fix your menu, we won't be back!"}
{"text":"There's something strange about Sauce. We came on a Saturday night, and while it was a little late (8:30), this is still Vegas, and it's clearly marked that it's open till midnight, so I was surprised at how quiet it was. I even wondered if the place was closed.

Inside felt similarly barren... it was just too quiet. I mean, nothing wrong with that, but it was kind of a strange quiet for a place that you'd never consider fine dining.

All that being said, we ended up with a pretty decent meal that included some pasta and a pizza at an affordable price. Service was mostly good, though we did have one wait.

I think the place could be good; it's definitely close, but they need to refine their process and somehow figure out how to inject some life into the building. It just doesn't seem to have any personality."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 medium pizzas for delivery last Saturday  at 5:45pm. We placed the order on  their website which indicated we would not get delivery for 1 1/2 hours. That seemed very long but we really wanted to try this place as we had heard the food was great. After waiting for almost 2 hours I tried calling them. They would not answer the phone at all. After 3 hours, around 9pm I got a call from them saying sorry, delivery guy had a flat tire and his phone died...! He said they would begin preparing our order again now if that was ok. I told him to refund my Amex card. We will NEVER order from this place again. What a complete lack of respect for customers. 1 star rating because it won't let you select 0 stars."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday lunch and the draft beer was off because the cooler was broken. I had the impression it was a new bar because it seemed a little unorganised and the bar tenders weren't that attentive. However, I found out it's been open two years. 

Had the garlic bites, they were OK because I was hungry but I wouldn't recommend. 

I'd come here again only because it's walking distance from the house and Sunday is happy hour all day. 

I hope for a better experience next time we come here."}
{"text":"If you come to Sauce, you're gonna LOVE their pesto creme sauce. Loved our server Salena, she gave my boyfriend and I the best service. He had the personal 8\" cheese pizza and I had their chicken sliders! Cheese was super rich, and boy was there plenty of it. My chicken was also cooked really well, no dry parts. Awesome cheap lunch specials, definitely worth your money here!"}
{"text":"Love Big Dean's. It has the best burgers, coldest beer and awesome people watching. It's a walk down memory lane every time I come here. 25 years ago was my first time here and it's not changed except for the new bar and seating area in the back. Food is always outstanding!"}
{"text":"All the food is from scratch, even the pepperoni stuffed fried cheese! Rich, flavorful sauces, big portions, and awesome staff. A can't miss. Great happy hour specials too!!"}
{"text":"Despite the disparity in star ratings and with 260 reviews currently sitting in the \"not recommended\" bin (meaning a high probability of fake accounts), I still wanted to give SAUCE a shot. The biggest issue seems to be with third-party delivery services, so we planned to dine in instead. With its namesake, I was expecting the sauce to be a little more discerning, but sadly it wasn't anything special. \"Meh. I've experienced better\" on Yelp means 2 stars.

AMBIANCE: Like a toddler trying on his dad's shoes, this place is too big for itself.  The wooden floors, warm red walls, and large limestone art pieces definitely were nice. They even had mini sky murals like the Venetian, but overall it felt cavernous and museum-like. Especially when it's dinner time and there's only one other table eating. Cue the tumbleweed.

SERVICE: Friendly, but not very fast. It's a head scratcher because there was no one there! The other table had their own server. The massive bar had only two people seated, and even so, they had the bartender all to themselves. Where do the servers go in their spare time? 

FOOD: We ordered the garlic knots as appetizers. I can say these were the best part of our meal -- served fresh and piping hot! My bf had the spaghetti & meatballs, while I had the bolognese lasagna. First impression: the sauce looks so watery. I didn't care much for it, but the ricotta and meat were good. I tried my bf's dish and it was too bland for me. Even their drinks tasted watered-down. Our cups and silverware had visible water spots. 

Overall, I'd say get the Groupon if you really want to give them a try. They might have better dishes than the ones we ordered, but for me, I'd take Olive Garden. Check please!"}
{"text":"Good free apitizer, and local whiskey.   I like the no smoke and food here.   Well done locally owned venue."}
{"text":"We ordered the open faced meatball sandwich and spaghetti and meatballs,  we had it delivered and we are quite a distance from the restaurant and it was still very hot when it arrived! !! It was very good!  We plan on visiting the restaurant soon to try more food! Everything was so fresh!  I told everyone at my work to go here."}
{"text":"Very happy! We had a happy hour set up for our local women's group. The room was all set up.  Service was excellent and very accommodating.  Personal pizza $5, artichoke  dip and wings were great. They also brought  out complimentary  foccacia bread with dipping oil that was GREAT!  Wonderful experience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We don't usually eat pasta, but when we do, it will have to be at Sauce.

Earl been wanting pasta, so at 3pm today, we decided to visit Sauce.  When we arrived, we see no cars, so we hesitated for a bit.  As we were walking toward the entrance, we saw a word doc taped to the door.  Earl assumed that they have moved.  But nope!  It's just letting guests know that they will be closed on Memorial Day.

We were greeted and walked to one of the booths by the bartender, who also took our order.  This restaurant is huge, with many tables and different dining area.

We chose the following:
-Tomato Basil Soup: Pretty good.  I would order this again.  Very hearty with croutons in them
-Arancini: The coating was too thick.  It was served on a bed of greens and marinara sauce.  Skip.
-Pasta is $16.50, you chose the sauce, the type of pasta (my hubby chose wheat penne, which cost an extra dollar), two toppings, and 1 free add on.

My angel hair pasta with pomodoro sauce (I had ordered Bolognese, but she placed pomodoro.  It's ok, because this turned out better), wild mushrooms, roasted garlic, and anchovies.  We both loved it.  I only killed 1/3 of this dish.  It was a lot of food.

My hubby got wheat penne with alfredo sauce, sun-dried tomato, roasted garlic, and prosciutto.  He loved it.

We could taste every single ingredients in our pasta, which is a good indicator that they were made with fresh ingredients.

It was a satisfactory meal, and we would definitely return to get our pasta fix."}
{"text":"Hadn't heard any buzz about the place, but was looking for good local (Green Valley) Italian entrées and pizza.  Went there for Sunday dinner, only to notice that the big cavernous bar and restaurant was dead.  I mean like 5 customers!  Ordered some appetizers:  garlic knots and calamari, but we're told they were out of the fried cheese stuffed with pepperoni. Surprising, since the waiter said everything was made from scratch and I knew those basic ingredients were in the kitchen. \"Scratch cooking\" was evident in how long it took for the food to come out of the kitchen!   Appetizers, which were pretty good, took 20 minutes and the chicken parm, lasagna and 3 pizzas took nearly a half hour more. 

The lasagna was all right, but wasn't close to the best I've had. On the other hand, the chicken parm was excellent (tender and very good sauce). The pizzas were good, but not great.  We had the meat lovers (good flavor, but soggy crust), the marguerite, (somewhat on the dry side) and the four cheese, which was too heavy on the garlic and slightly burnt. 

The servers were friendly and tried to be attentive. All in all a positive experience that I would consider trying again, but if Sunday's business was any indication of future success, they may not be there for long."}
{"text":"I know you see mixed reviews on here but DONT DO IT. You will waste your money 100% guaranteed !!!
Never eat here and if your thinking of a late night delivery do not pick this place through eat24. The food was delivered an hour and a half past the hour time frame window eat 24 already claimed it would be. Then when the food arrived and not a single item was warm, nor even edible.
We through the entire 80 dollars worth of food into the trash. I wish I had pictures because the ones on here are not how our food looked...
And considering the fact that the manager Kelly did not want to create a happy returning customer and fix this situation was even more of joke.

If you order from here you will regret it. You mine as well eat the cash in your wallet because their food tastes the same.... and it's probably just as sanitary"}
{"text":"A perfect place for good tasting Italian food. Great Pizza options that don't come out of plastic bags. And they Deliver all over the Valley!  Entertainment some nights. A perfect gathering place centrally located in Henderson"}
{"text":"we got delivery way in NLV so we appreciated that the most. the food was really delicious, though. we ordered the Tuscan potato soup (very very yummy) and shrimp Alfredo (reallu good as well) with a mixed green salad. just might order again."}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from here 4 or 5 times. 2 times they delivered well outside the expected timeframe, the other times was well within the time. The food, when delivered on time, is good. The sauce burger and five cheese burger are our favorites. Their garlic parmesan fries comes with their Alfredo which makes them perfect, though not quite worth the hefty price for them. Overall the food is good, but the delivery is hit and miss."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a must try if you enjoy Italian food.  Their tomato sauce is fabulous, very authentic and delicious. Rich and Salena make it extra special with their genuine  hospitality and friendliness. I will absolutely go back again, especially to try their gourmet Arrinchini appitizers. Love this bistro!! A+"}
{"text":"My oppinion is pretty bias because im from Brooklyn NY home of the best pizza ever! lol
..my kids liked the pizza here-nothing extrodinary tho. The best part of the meal was the Free bread, I can eat their bread all day. The \"charred wings\" had no char and tasted like anyone else's wings, I ordered the Eggplant Rollatini, I'm a huge fan of eggplant and had very high hopes for this dish but I was very disappointed smh it tasted like something that was in the freezer for a long time, Deep fried and smothered with sauce-No bueno..the calimari wasn't good either. Service was good but the food was not. I'm just glad I didn't have to pay full price for all of that good I went on a Wednesday when it's not 50% off your entire check, so that's a plus"}
{"text":"Hey guys, I call bullshit on the fact that we placed an order 8 minutes before two AM, through the Eat24 app, AND I called to confirm you received the order AND the guy I spoke with, Saturday night/Sunday morning at 1:50something assured me the delivery would be made within 30 minutes. How much does your life suck that you work in the restaurant industry and you totally screw customers over by not delivering what they ordered? Congrats Dude! Classy!!"}
{"text":"Every time we have eaten here it has been a delicious experience. The food has always been very tasty and the service has been very good. Their pizza/pasta sauce is yummy and they have a half off your entire bill special on Wednesdays (there are some exclusions). Great family restaurant or place to host a large group."}
{"text":"tried this place for the first time last night and i should have gotten the hint that its not that good when there was only 4 cars outside.  place was empty except for 2 people at the bar and they sat us in the very back of the resturant.  don't have chicken fingers. the waiter did not even tell us about the happy hour food specials and one of my items that i ordered was on the special but he charged me full price.  all the specials they post on their facebook page is for delivery no dine in.  worst $30 i spent in a long time.  i would have been much happier with mcdonald or taco bell."}
{"text":"I love the food and atmosphere.  The way the inside of the building is set up is tasteful.  The staff have a welcoming tone and conversate with you. The specials  are pretty good.  I really enjoy the food,  Italian comfort."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, and a diverse menu with a build your own pasta dish will be bringing us back for more. ;) Also the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"The food was very good garlic knots were awesome. There was a group of us and we got there at 530pm. We sat at the bar and the male bartender seemed very annoyed with having to serve us. When I pulled up the Yelp offer for a free appetizer the pregnant bartender needed to go see if we could use it. Really there were no restrictions on the offer. To me customer service is a HUGE part of me liking a place and they didn't make the cut.we asked the make bartender if you could smoke in there and we think he said no not now after 10pm. But we weren't sure because he mumbled that part as he walked away. I moved away from Henderson but I was there for a party and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Been here 100 times already, I think it's time for a review.

First, the service; all of the staff are attentive and amazing at what they do. They are friendly as hell and make you feel at home.

Now, for the food; HANDS DOWN THE BEST PASTA IN TOWN! Sorry for the caps lock, but you can now feel my conviction. I love all of their pasta, especially the lemon butter and bolognese. Their garlic knots are also to die for. Finally, their spicy BBQ chicken wings are easily the best wings I've had in town.

With how good their food is, I truly don't understand why there isn't a 10 mile long line out the door. Maybe location? Either way, just know that you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have ordered several times and the food has always been great. Most recently, I ordered a medium two topping pizza garlic knots and wings. Everything was delicious--especially the wings. 

Sometimes the delivery can take a bit; but, eat 24 and Sauce are pretty good at providing updates (and it's always been worth the wait).

Tip--the pepperoni stuffed fried cheese is fantastic."}
{"text":"I am not sure who is writing fake reviews but this place is terrible. My last order was not even delivered yet they charged my card any way. This place is awful. My roommate had a horrible experience as well"}
{"text":"Have been here 3 times and won't go back. Service the first time was so so. The second time, our waiter was great so figured we'd give it another try. Got there around 12:30 pm on a Sunday. Only 2 other cars in the parking lot. The waitress yelled from across the restaurant asking how many people we had. Really? You couldn't walk up and ask? She seats us, doesn't explain any of their specials or anything. She was hardly ever around and never had our drinks refilled. Never even asked. Very very poor service"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to Sauce since they opened!  The variety of dishes are endless and the tastes are fabulous.  My sister, her husband and many of our friends/neighbors join us weekly.  It has turned into our favorite spot for Wednesday dining.  It's half price dining or just Happy Hour for drinks!!  The owner, Rich, manager Kelly and staff are all welcoming, attentive and professional!!! We recommend it to all of our friends."}
{"text":"We have ordered delivery now 10 times. Always comes hot, the service is quick and the delivery people are always polite and happy. The chicken parm and the Chicken Piccata are amazing, so much so we haven't tried anything else. Great with picky kid meals as well. 10 times and been a perfect 10. Quick service and every bite was tasty."}
{"text":"Found this when I drove to the back side of the mall by taking Galleria Drive.  We used to come here when it was the Spaghetti Factory, so when I saw that it is now open, I suggested it to my hubby for our Sunday date night.

Driving in, it was so empty we thought it was closed,  but happily, it was not.  We ate in the dining room, and found that the background noise wasn't overwhelming,  as is too often the c as se.  Our waitress was great; knowledgeable,  attentive without rushing us.  We got a free appetizer by posting on Yelp and no hassle for that when the check came.  Food was great, authentic flavors, fresh, great prices and plentiful.   With appetizer, entrees,  drinks and dessert,  the total with tip was less than we usually pay. Try it!"}
{"text":"Great dining experience. We heard that the Seabass was incredible. $19 but the dish they served us would easily have been $40 or $50 at most strip restaurants. Absolutely delicious. My wife had soup & salad. Huge portion and delicious.  Newer place so I think they're still working out some things."}
{"text":"Service was stellar! I always go to galleria and see this place and finally checked it out. You can make your own pastas and pizzas and the flavors are yummy. Not to mention, they surely do not lag in sauce. The pasta is hearty of sauce and that's how I loved it. Also, I saw a cigar lounge. Gotta go back and check that out!"}
{"text":"I liked the place, it was very good. I have see in a previous rating that they waited a long time for their food. I didn't I was served right away. maybe that patron just happen to have a bad waiter at the time. I was served fairly quickly. I was however disappointed that a beer advertised on the menu they did not have. I ordered off the create your pasta section on the menu, I had the lunch portion during lunch and I was quit full on the pasta that was served to me. I do remember the old Blues BBQ before it and the decor looked similar, not much in changes to the dining room or bar. Some but very little. Also as mentioned in a previous rating to get the business in they have to definealty get more advertising out there. There just was not a lot of people in the restaurant during the lunch hour I was there. I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Boo. New place in the neighborhood so I wanted it to be delicious but it wasn't. At all. The appetizers were awful. We had the Pepperoni Bites and the Mozzarella Tomato Bake. The Pepperoni Bites tasted frozen and weren't hot when they came out. The Mozzarella Tomato Bake looked and tasted like a mess. They baked the whole tomato slices until they were mush and then drenched it all in \"special sauce\" which is balsamic vinegar. It was horrible, I sent it back. 

For the meal we had a really bland meat lovers style pizza. It looked amazing when it came out but it had no flavor. The dough, the meat, the cheese....it could have just as easily been frozen that's how bland the taste was. 

We also had the create your own pasta. I got the Cheese Tortellini Alfredo with Chicken. It was $17 and again, bland! The pasta was overlooked, the sauce was thin and bland, the chicken seemed to be frozen grilled chicken, like you'd find on a grilled chicken sandwich at a cheap fast food place...maybe it's chicken, maybe it's not lol. 

The inside is very nice. The staff are also very nice! Just the food....the most important part wasn't good. I recommend, skip this place. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I was torn between three and four so I will round up based on my two positive dining experiences here.

I actually think this is a pretty good restaurant, but I'm not sure how anyone is finding them. They are in the parking lot of the Galleria Mall, but on the back side across the lot from Kohl's. This is less than five minutes from our house and we didn't know they were there. How did we find them? My parents were in town and they like to drive every single street in the area looking to see what restaurants and shops we have that they don't have in Ohio. They came back from their scouting mission and insisted we try this place. 

We have enjoyed all of the food items that we have tried here. On first visit (dinner) I had the Mediterranean salad which had a very tasty creamy lemon dressing that was memorable. I don't recall what my parents and husband had that night, but I do remember everyone enjoyed their food and said they'd return. 

Our most recent visit was for lunch on a Saturday. I had the steak salad special which was steak on a bed of spinach with mandarin oranges, gorgonzola, and a carmelized onion dressing. The salad was delicious and the steak on top was very flavorful and well prepared. My husband had the lasagna and really enjoyed it. I tasted some and thought the bite I tried was delicious. Both of our meals were generous portions and we thought the pricing was reasonable for the portions. 

The service yesterday was a little awkward. I'm only mentioning it because I think the food is good and I'd like to see this place stay in business. Our waitress was also the hostess yesterday. She seemed really annoyed during the time we were there. She wasn't rude to us, but she wasn't friendly either. I did think she was a little short with the table next to us and they didn't do anything to deserve it. My suggestion would be that you put more emphasis on good service so that people want to go out of their way to dine here."}
{"text":"Sauce sucks. I have ordered delivery twice and both times the toppings on the pizza were wrong as well as the toppings slid to one side of the pizza. The delivery driver did not come with change on the 1st order and asked me to let him keep the change which was $10.00 because he was unwilling to go get change. I thought maybe the 1st experience was a fluke so I ordered again. 2nd time was worse. Food cold. Pizza toppings wrong and on one side of the pizza. Panini sloppy and undercooked and the bonus chicken wings were raw and we ended up sick. I demanded a refund which they agreed and have yet to give me. They have been reported to the health dept and the BBB. The manager Kelly has no customer service skills and a guy named Rich (possibly the owner) he is horrible and told me to fuck off when I called for my refund."}
{"text":"The service was so warm & helpful Selina makes you want to return just because she is so wonderful! I ordered the Chicken Marsala-this was the best chicken marsala that I have ever had in my life!!! When we go back I don't even want to  try anything else, it's addicting. I will probably add sliced tomatoes with balsamic, they have the best balsamic. They offer complimentary fresh focaccia with balsamic & olive oil. My husband ordered his own meat lovers pizza... any meat lover will be in heaven! He couldn't get over how much meat was on it & how fresh & high quality this meat is.     The prices are not bad either! And the décor is really pleasant-nice job to the interior design team. When we were leaving one of the owners Brandon walked outside with us (getting chilly brr) fist bumped my husband & thanked us for coming in. 
 I saw some reviews about slow service, this was not what we experienced, everything was very nice when we were there.
 I really hope this place makes it, it is a great addition to our neighborhood & we'd like to see Sauce become a permanent resident here in Henderson. You gotta try this place, you will love it!"}
{"text":"Sadly after last night I had to knock the review down a bit.

Environment: The bar was nice as clean as usual with a good layout. (restrooms were clean as well)

Karaoke: The Karaoke DJ was very consistent as well.

Food Quality: mmmmm.... them wings.

Staff: This is where I had to knock a star down.
- There was almost no service in the Karaoke room the entire time I was there from 10:30pm - 1:30AM.
- There wasn't anyone coming in to ask if folks wanted drinks, refills or food. (Quite frankly I've been to biker bars with better service where the staff would carry $1 shots)
- There wasn't anyone coming in to bus the tables after the drinks were consumed. (luckily the Karaoke crowd was polite and everyone kept the place clean and brought back their glasses and plates to the bar.)

Personal experience:
The bar and restaurant was pretty quiet at the time. I ordered 3 drinks at the bar and proceeded to turn around with my arms full to walk to back into the Karaoke room, during that time my wings showed up as well. Obviously seeing I need help I was told to just drop down the drinks at my table and come back to the bar to pick up the wings. NOTE: (While some folks of the staff was sitting at the bar enjoying red wine. They could have been on break, but I'm not sure if enjoying red wine during work hours is normal.)

I'm not sure what was happening with the lack of service. Maybe the servers were restricted to the restaurant only, maybe they didn't see thesmall Karaoke crowd as profitable, or maybe the red wine at the bar was that good. But the throughout the night there were only 2 people I interacted with and got service form 1. the bar tender, 2. the Karaoke DJ."}
{"text":"I come to the Sauce often.. Normally it is average. Bbq chx pizza is amazing and the chard wings are also very good. They have a Happy Hour that I love and that's when I normally go. It's reasonable and close to work. I don't really expect anything too much from this place... But when I ordered the GRILLED CHEESE AND TOMATO SOUP lunch special I was disappointed. The soup is amazing. The grilled cheese is terrible. I think they made it on sour dough bread and put it in the panni press, the cheeses are not melted and the bread gives it a tang that almost makes it seem rotten. I like sour dough so that's not it, maybe the mixture of it being cold - hard and the weird texture from the panni press and grill... I dunno just not the thing I was expecting. I really do love the Happy Hour though and I guess I just will stick with that. Not really a good spot if you are looking for yummy lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Some people say pizza is pizza but not to me I'm very picky and I have to say every single bite of this pizza was delish, including the little dough balls that they cover in powdered sugar and dip in chocolate and caramel are to die for even on its own, hands down best pizza I've had in a long while!"}
{"text":"Sauce, I wanted to like you. You never gave me a chance. 

  I had heard of your happy hour specials. After work, my energy had been too drained to make the trip to the north parking lot of the Galleria Mall. Yesterday I had the chance to give you a try. I had just voted in the Galleria Mall and when I was in the bottom level of Kohl's sneaker hunting, I looked out the door to lay eyes on you a few hundred feet away. It was time to take a hiatus from shopping to give you a try. The walk from Kohl's is a beeline to your door. Some malls like the one in St. George, Utah would consider you a mall tenant. As I neared closer to the door that faces the mall (not Galleria Drive), I saw the Happy Hour specials. That could be for another time. It was 2 pm on a Friday afternoon. As I made it nearer to the door, I noticed that the parking lot was barron. This was an oman to the infinitesimal amount of customers inside. 

  Now inside, I am standing inside a colossal lifeless building that reminded me of a monastery. I'd gaze at an unoccupied host station to my right, empty bar in the middle, and monastery spaces to my left and right. I'd gaze and gaze and gaze for ten minutes. I was feeling like an unwanted bull. My left foot was bothering me and I did not want to resume sneaker shopping just yet. There seemed to be a want of a seating policy. To me, your policy is sauce. Was I supposed to walk deeper into the monastery rooms? Was an employee (there are employees here?) going to venture toward the entrance where there might just be a slight possibility that an individual could of walked inside with an intention of like eating here? Why wasn't there a buzzer that informs an employee that somebody is here? Finally, a waitress acknowledged me. She apologized for the long delay on account of a blind spot where she did not see me. That is a bunch of sauce because she should of occasionally walked past this blind spot to the waiting area where customers are waiting to be seated. 

  I followed the waitress (no hostess here at 2 pm on this Friday). we walked deep into the recesses of the monastery to the left. For whatever reason I am one of the couple of people in this restaurant, and she seats me out of the way. Why not nearer the kitchen where I would be nearby instead of some Bull seated way out in the boondocks of the monastery. The waitress gave me the menu. This is the last I'd see of her. 

 Spending some time in your lifeless place, I had trouble believing that you are this energetic bar slash Italian restaurant in the later hours of the day. I just couldn't fathom it. As I looked at the menu, it was dawning on me that I was better off transforming from an unwanted Bull to royalty at a different place. This is Las Vegas after all and not Siberia. The menu just wasn't the kind of sauce that is my flavor. I saw relatively few lunch specials. But my love for eggplant parmesan with provolone cheese topped with pasta and a glass of Coke turned a blind eye to the fact that there was zero mention of coming with a soup or salad. If only you gave me a chance I would of exchanged $20 of my hard earned money for it. I remained an ignored bull. I had had enough. I was now in the mood to be appreciated in either Miller's Ale House or Cafe Zupas. It was time to leave the lifeless spaces of the monastery. 

  Sauce, I wanted to like you. But you barely acknowledged me and in reality should open at 4 pm,  if you treat customers like this as 2 pm. I don't like going to a restaurant to feel like an unwanted bull. To me that is just bull sauce."}
{"text":"Went On Wednesday with my friend and our daughters so it was a girls night :)  Excellent food and that particular night everything was half off so it was even better!!  The place didn't have many people inside and so the ambiance was kinda dry but once the food and drinks started rolling it was excellent!!  I will say the hostess was NOT the highlight!!  She was the first person we saw and were greeted by and she seemed so blah!!  That's a problem.. She wasn't rude at all but she just seemed miserable.  Hopefully it was just an off night for her but if this is the norm then I can see why the place seems slow..  We had so many different things since it was half off night.. Pizza's, anti-pasta platter, garlic knots, risotto balls, etc.  it was all fresh and hot.  The server was nice and humble.  I cant wait too go back!!  The only thing this place needs in my opinion is CUSTOMERS!!"}
{"text":"Decided to check out this place with a groupon. Groupon fine print state \"not valid for happy hour specials\" so we went for a late lunch at 2:30pm. Pulled into the parking lot and thought the place was closed. There weren't any cars in the parking lot and the building looks kind of abandoned. We walked in, and we were greeted promptly, however we weren't sure if we were going to stay because the there was no one else in the restaurant. We looked at the menu and decided to give it a try since we had a groupon! We started with the spinach and artichoke dip, it appeared to be made with fresh spinach and was served with delicious bread. Then we ordered three lunch specials, two classic panini's with salad and a grilled cheese with tomato soup. Everything was pretty good. When we were ready to pay we were told our groupon was not valid for lunch specials, so we paid full price and got a refund on our groupon. Overall ok place, but strange we were the only people there for the entire hour we spent there. Giving three stars for ambience and because we couldn't use our groupon."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. First of all the service was great. Our waiter was friendly, efficient, and helpful. We ordered the calamari which was very tender and had a light batter. Then the shrimp scampi pizza which was delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We decided to go there after church. It was my lovely, wife and two of the brood. 

We walked in and went to the hostess stand and were not greeted for 10 minutes. My wife said to leave but part of me wanted to stay to see if service could be this bad. (I guess I like train wrecks) Someone walked by and I assumed she was the hostess, I told her we needed a table for 4 but alas, she was a customer. Finally a woman came out and greeted us and sat us. It turned out that she was a one woman show. And I don't mean that in a positive way.

The waitress seemed like she was hung over really bad. She was pleasant but just didn't have her act together. I think she should have stayed home and not come to work. 

We ordered the food and it came out timely,  When the runner dropped off the food, I asked him for some bread and he said \"how was the bread?\" I told him we never got any, that's why I asked for it. She forgot the bring it, oops

Through all of the trials of dealing with the less than stellar server, the food was delicious. Except for the alfredo  sauce, it was pretty tasteless. They did have gluten free pasta so my wife was happy, but the tasteless sauce made her unhappy

The arancini were delicious and perfectly cooked. The marinara sauce was great too. 
I had the ravioli with Bolognese sauce and it was one of the best I had. That's the only reason I gave it two stars

This space has been 4 or 5 different restaurants over the past 10 years. Its a nice looking restaurant but the location isn't that great. 

I really hope the owners deal with the service issue because their food is pretty good. I would hate to see it go under like the previous businesses"}
{"text":"I really enjoy their food and am surprised it's not busier then it is. I've eaten there probably 5 times now and it's always been good. I think my favorite is the Italian Chimichanga and I like the stuffed cheese with pepperoni appetizer. Last time I went, I had a pizza and it was also very good and plentiful.

Service has always been good, sometimes better then others, but never an issue.

This has quickly become one of my family's favorite Italian Restaurants."}
{"text":"Good food, good flavor but they still have work to earn regular customers.
Meals don't include a small dinner salad. No kids menu or crayons. Happy hour drink at bar is full price at dinner table. Create your own pasta and pick any sauce for same price but if you ask for a different sauce on your chicken parm they charge extra$2. Feels like they want more small couples than families."}
{"text":"I hate to have to write a bad review but I hope that maybe the owner will read and take suggestions before this restaurant closes like the others have in this location.         
We went in at 630 on a Saturday and the place was pretty empty. The menu and the signage outside both mentioned \"happy hour\". I guess we weren't in the right area because we asked if we could get the happy hour price for an appetizer and were told that was in the bar only, like two tables away. So whatever, no big deal that brought our pepperoni cheese sticks to $8 instead of $5.50. If they would have been better I wouldn't have cared. The pesto and marinara sauces were good but the cheese itself was small so when it was breaded and fried it was quite dried out. I should have thought better and not have ordered the eggplant Parmesan but I wanted to give it a try. It was also too thinly sliced and therefore dried out as well. My daughter got the chicken panini w fries and liked it, my son went w the breakfast burger and liked the egg that was still runny. My daughter asked for ranch for her fries and my son asked for some as well. No big deal. They brought out the customary small plastic cups w ranch. I must say I was unpleasantly surprised to find that we were charged $.79 for each small cup of ranch. I know the two criticisms total $4 but it's more the point of trying to make a great impression on first time customers. Old Spaghetti Factory couldn't make it and that was better so this place needs to turn up the WOW if it wants to make it."}
{"text":"AMAZING food GREAT staff!!!
This is my first Yelp review and it was well worth signing up to post it. 
My previous favorite Henderson pizza joint / Italian joint closed a couple weeks ago and I was quite sad to see them go BUT Sauce is now officially my new favorite local restaurant/bar. 
They have great hand tossed pizza and the bruschetta is amazing. 
Can't wait to try more of their menu. 
Beer and booze selection is great. If you like IPA beers, try Pine In The Neck...which is a Blue Moon beer I have never heard of before. 
Met one of the owners...super nice guy working hard to keep the customers happy and coming back for more with great food and good service. 
Service was great, staff was super nice and personal. Staff is also very attentive but not obnoxious. 
This is my second visit and I'll be back for sure. 
Easy access from the 95 off of Galleria drive behind the mall. 
Check it out for yourself if you don't believe me."}
{"text":"Really good food. I had the pesto cream sauce. Nice to have a local Italian restaurant in Henderson. Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Had such a wonderful memorable experience here on our trip to vegas. I am a huge walking dead fan, and our hotel did not carry the AMC Channel, so, omg, what's a girl to do? Internet to the rescue! Turns out Sauce hosts a watching dead party every Sunday night, lucky for me!
We arrive shortly after 8:00 pm and we are each given a ticket for a free drink, Score! There are different vendor tables, comics, figurines, t-shirts, etc. I bought an awesome walking dead T-shirt for 8 bucks, another score, and now i am decently attired for the event. There was also a woman doing free zombie makeup, and the results were incredible.
The cast from evil dead, the musical, hangs out with the crowd during the event, which adds to the overall theme of the evening. Lots of TV's throughout the restaurant/bar, all tuned into the walking dead, so you never miss a moment of the show.
During commercial breaks there is a trivia contest based on what has been on the show so far, so pay attention to the little details while you watch. The prize bags are different but oh so fun to win. We won a Merle zombie collectible figure, so stoked over that win!
Service was super great, despite the crowd. We opted for pizzas and a Caesar salad. Delicious, but more than we could eat, so we shared with the table. Our glasses were never empty and everyone that worked at the restaurant was super friendly.
Overall, this was one of the highlights of our trip. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Attended a networking lunch with a selection of 6 or 8 items to choose from.  I selected the Mediterranean salad for $12. I found the salad to be overly dressed with a thick,  creamy dressing.  Surprising choice when a red wine or balsamic vinaigrette would have been both more authentic to the Mediterranean cuisine and would not have weighted the salad down so much.  The large wedges of tomato in the salad were not cored and not very ripe or flavorful. The chicken on the salad was seasoned well.  There was a generous portion of artichoke hearts and kalamata olives which help provide acid and flavor to better balance the creamy dressing. Service was friendly and efficient given the size of the business crowd. Bottom line, although not in love with the selected dish, ready to give it another try with a different selection due to the service and convenient business meeting space."}
{"text":"Super average. Nice decor inside but the food is very, very average. I think when you go to a restaurant it should be food that's more elevated than what you could make at home. And it wasn't. The spaghetti sauce on my sons dinner tasted like it was out of a can. My husbands sandwich was so bland that panera would have been a better choice. I hope the owners look at the menu and try to make their dishes more interesting bc if not I don't see them being in business for very long."}
{"text":"I see all these wonderful reviews, I hate that I have to be the one person to dislike everything I ordered. I don't blame everything on them. For one, I live 15 to 20 minutes away, but that is no excuse to take 3 hours to deliver. I had called after an hour to check on the status, after I had sent a request through yelp. They had told me should be there by 730pm. Mind you, I ordered at 530. No problem. The problem came when they arrived at 815 and the food was to say the most mediocre. I had ordered;  2 pasta dishes, calamari, soup cup and a side salad. The dressing and salad was pretty good, but the spaghetti and meatballs only had 1 meatball and the sauce was just a little sweet for our taste. The build your own pasta I made was supposed to be tortilini with a lemon butter sauce with mushrooms and shrimp. When it arrived 3 hours later it had 2 shrimp, pasta was over done, and the sauce was completely oil that spilled all over the other bags. Calamari was decent considering how far they had traveled. Lastly,  the soup was the potato soup that seemed to just be butter and cream. No other flavor. We actually ran it down the drain so it wouldn't be in the trash. I hate to write a negative review, but I'm hoping it will help the to-go orders in the future. Again, I understand they delivered way further than any other Italian restaurant, and the staff that delivered was very friendly. But for $70.00 I kind of wanted a little better quality and standards."}
{"text":"Cool new place on the outside of galleria mall

Pros: 
Pesto crab cakes were outstanding

Pasta: cool concept where you can make your own concoction. I love cream and I love pesto so that was a winner.

Service was friendly and attentive 

Grab that groupon!

Cons:

I got the Quattro formagi pizza and I like Gorgonzola but it seemed to be a bit overpowering compared to the other cheese trio on a Quattro. I would stick to the appetizers and pasta since everything else we tried was pretty good. Dough was \"ok\".

Wanted to try the tiramasu based on yelp pics. Maybe next time. Will be back."}
{"text":"Pizza was good. The cheese pumpkin pie wasn't worth the price. It was delivered without the topping. Overall the cost was way to much. Took a long time to deliver."}
{"text":"My first visit was yesterday and the food was amazing. I am a pretentious food eater and I absolutely loved what I had. Garlic knots, amazing, mixed green salad with salmon, amazing. Pizza, AMAZING. I've been in Vegas for a year and this is the best pizza I've had. Their dough is on point. Service is great and the atmosphere is awesome. Check this place out! 

PS. Everything on the menu all day on Wednesday is HALF off. Including alcohol! Half off!"}
{"text":"1 Star is too many.  

Had a Living Social deal for $13 on a $26 min. Made a reservation for Dec 24th at 7:30pm. I called day before to check hours and reservation times. Lady said, \"We'll be open as late as we have people in the restaurant, and the kitchen will be open until AT LEAST 9pm. We're taking reservations for 7 & 7:30, would you like to make one?\"  I told her I'd check with my wife.  I did and we made one through Yelp for the 7:30 slot she said was open, so they KNEW they had one coming at 7:30.  Yelp even sent me a reminder that day.  (We use Open Table ALL the time and have NEVER had an issue with their system.

We get there at 7:30.  There were several groups still there, eating and drinking.  But, we were told, \"We closed at 7\"...\"Nobody would have taken that reservation\", and \"You must have made the reservation for a California location.\"  This lady had such a nasty attitude, we were flabbergasted.  When I told her I made it on Yelp and showed her, she didn't care just said they closed at 7 and that was that.

We turned around and walked out.  It took us half an hour to find a decent place to eat on Christmas Eve, after we just spent 12 hours in our own store with our customers, who we would NEVER talk to or treat this way.

Bottom line, this lady and Sauce ruined was to be the cap on a long holiday season for us.

We will never come back, and given how many restaurants have come and gone in this location, can't wait to see what's next if this lady and her crew continue to treat people this way.

Wait....is that the Karma truck I see circling?

By the way, while Yelp refused to do anything to intervene, Open Table would have jumped in, contacted the restaurant and done something to help make it right.  So Yelp, if you want to compete on the Reservation side, take some lessons from Open Table and step up when you have a reservation issue, and not just, \"...the restaurant is responsible for maintaining their own schedule and there is no way for us to know when a restaurant is, or is not, open without their input.\""}
{"text":"I'm going to say that going in I did not have high hopes. This location has not done well for folks in the food business. It has been a spaghetti  factory a sports bar and a BBQ joint. We decided to give it a try since it id close to home. We were seated right away. It was empty except for some very loud drinkers at the bar. Fried Calamari was tasty and had a bite to it that got our dinner kicked off good so fay. Drinks were ordered and filled promptly as needed. You order your pasta and choice of sauce and wait to be hopefully impressed. I saw mixed reviews so I was tempered in my expectations. I ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken. Can I say this was good. Perfectly creamy and not runny had a garlic flavor with Asiago and parmesan cheese. A very full plate of goodness. I can say this is a hidden gem and needs to be discovered. I do not remember waht Josie ordered but she did like it. She is a Pasta Mia fan and so am I. But for a short drive this will do for a good pasta meal and a decent price. Get over there and try it."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice dinner at Sauce last night. We have been there once before and it was good. Last night was even better. Lasagna was delicious!! Looking forward to the leftovers for lunch today! Their garlic knots are amazing and the wings were perfectly done. We left very satisfied and our server was very attentive. Thank you for a great meal!"}
{"text":"The chicken wings for the best we've had in a long time, I read a review that said this place is always empty and it was at the food was good and they are right, we split the spaghetti and meatballs because it was a huge dish and it was delicious. Jason was our waiter and he always noticed when we were low on drinks and needed more napkins good service."}
{"text":"We went here during a Sat afternoon.  Kelly, the owner really was nice and personable.  I even told her that I had a Groupon and most establishments frown on it, but she didn't have any issues with it.  

We began with the charred wings in bbq sauce.  By far, one of the yummiest wings that I have had.  It was juicy with a tasty and tangy sauce.  

My friend and I ordered the breakfast burger.  I was so full from the wings, that I ate the fries and took the burger back to the house.  

From the sight of my buddy, it looked like he was satisfied.  Think about it....four wings each and a breakfast burger and STEAK FRIES!

The service was wonderful and the food was as well.
They even switched the tvs to my desired games and that was awesome of them to do that.  

Make sure you tip on the full value of the Groupon. 

I will certainly return, even w/o a Groupon deal."}
{"text":"I came out on Friday night for karaoke, and ended up having some drinks and food.

First of all, Chris, the bartender, was awesome.  He let us know about their specials, and he mixes a great Cinnamon Toast shot! (try it, you'll love it.)

My fella was hungry, and so he ordered the Arancini, which was a fried risotto ball, with meat and cheese inside.  Oh. My. God.  I shouldn't have had any, since it isn't on my diet, but...I had to try it!  It was amazing.  (I really wanted to say \"amazeballs, because they were risotto balls. he he.) So flavorful!

Our server was a sweetheart too, although I don't remember her name. 

The place itself is HUGE, and really nice.  I loved that they have a stage set up for karaoke, and for live music nights. 

I only have one tiny \"complaint\", and its more of a note, as a way to improve...I'd LOVE to see a trash can next to the bathroom door...germaphobes like me like to open the bathroom door with a paper towel and it would be nice to be able to dispose of it next to the door.

Other than that, service was spot on, prices were reasonable, and the food/drinks were great!  Can't wait to come out again for another karaoke night!"}
{"text":"five cheese burger was killer and so are the wings. looking forward to trying something new on our next visit."}
{"text":"An awesome Italian joint to go to in Henderson. The food is absolutely delicious. Not to mention they have a great happy hour that allows you to try some of their main dishes at a discounted price! Hopefully they can survive the mall ring circle curse."}
{"text":"When I first came up to the place, there was hardly anybody in the parking lot. So I decided not to try it the first time. The second time we came in, we decided to try it and thank goodness we did! Luckily for me and my wife, we live by the mantra you don't know until you try. 

The bruschetta was excellent, the crab cakes were fantastic...pesto crab cakes to be exact. Then came my pizza, it was delicious! My wife decided to get the chicken sandwich and it was juicy on a sesame seed bun. 

If you decide to go out to eat, try this place and don't judge it by the parking lot."}
{"text":"We went for a lunch sat at noon and we were the only ones there lol I enjoyed it. The bread was amazing for olive oil dipping. We both had paninis and side salad which were pretty good. I had a 2 for 1 from the entertainment app which made even more worth it. It's a strange location but I liked it"}
{"text":"So we started off with drinks my wife had a beer and I had red wine we continued on with appetizers we had the garlic knots and we ordered a barbecue chicken bacon and onion pizza it was absolutely wonderful!

My wife had the Chicken Parmesan and I had the Seabass sautéed with mushrooms artichoke and capers over a bed sautéed spinach.

This restaurant \"Sauces\" has been open since August, the food is really good the service is really dependable, the place is clean and the decor is really nice.

Best hidden secret in the green valley Henderson area, the galleria is a very large place, go north to the very end of the parking lot and you'll find \"Sauces\"  

The best little Italian restaurant and bar in Henderson!"}
{"text":"Was a great place and good was good no longer living in the area anymore but when we are will be back"}
{"text":"The food was okay, but incredibly overpriced. I waited in a completely empty bar for 20 minutes in order to get a house salad with avocados and two orders of pasta. One order was for fettuccini with rose sauce, tomatoes, broccoli, and meatballs. It came with Alfredo sauce, tomatoes, broccoli, and one meatball. I had mentioned to the server that I was planning on splitting it between my 3 kids, and asked if there would be enough. I guess she figured that little kids don't eat meatballs??? She asked if they were under 10. I said yes- I have two 7-year-olds and a 5-year-old. She said that there would be enough for all three, and that the portions were REALLY huge, AND they came with bread!!!! (We got 3 slices of warm bread.) They all said that they were still hungry when they were done. The reason I was questioning the portion size was because a plate of pasta with one meat and two vegetables costs $16.50, which seemed a little expensive to me. So I ended up paying $48 for two plates of pasta and a house salad with avocado. And they didn't get the sauce right on one of the plates. It was a to go order, and I didn't feel like going back. I called a couple of times, but the phone was busy. Rant over."}
{"text":"After one visit at lunch and one visit during dinner visit in the last two months, Sauce is A-OK. Various coupons/discounts are available for sauce which we used on both visits. Groupon $18 for $30 was used on the first visit and Yelp deal $50 voucher for $25, which was found on the Yelp app, was used on the second visit.

On our first lunchtime visit, we were sat in the bar area and I took the recommendations of our server Bernadette. For the appetizer, we had the pepperoni stuffed fried cheese. For entrees, my wife had the California panini and I had the Italian chimichanga. The common thread with our appetizer and my entree was the mix of pesto cream sauce and the tomato based marinara and arrabbiata sauces. I didn't think that was a good pairing. I might have the fried cheese again but without the pesto cream sauce. I wouldn't get the chimichanga again. There's too many ingredients (meatballs, sausage, mushrooms, peppers, mozzarella, and feta along with the arrabbiata and creamy pesto sauces) that just didn't meld well together.

On our second visit, we were seated on a Saturday night with one other table in the dining room. We ordered the kids fettuccine alfredo, the sauce sea bass (they were out of sea bass and salmon was substituted), and the create your pasta consisting of fettuccine, signature red sauce, meatball, roasted garlic, and mushrooms. If you're a garlic fan and not looking for any kind of make out session after dinner, order roasted garlic with your pasta. There were a total of about ten cloves of garlic in my pasta. For dessert, we had the zeppoli which was probably the best dish of the meal. Even with the lack of business, service was still slow. Everything was OK with this visit with nothing being bad, but nothing being that memorable.

The menu is large with a mix of traditional dishes and different creations so it's highly probable to find something of your liking. We just didn't score with either of our visits. I'd come back here if we had a discount or deal as we did with our previous visits and maybe we might find the dish that is right for us."}
{"text":"So this is my first time ordering here and definitely my last. I ordered on grub hub and 15 minutes after ordering grub hub called to tell me two of the three items I ordered weren't available. Then I waited over two hours for my food to be delivered. I ended up canceling my order and going to McDonalds because I couldn't wait any longer. Not a good first impression and I'm very disappointed. The promotor, Kelly Selva, friended me on Facebook and posts great pictures of the food which is why I ordered but due to the terrible level of service I will not order again."}
{"text":"This place has quickly become one of my favorite dinner options thanks to Bite Squad. Food portions are HUGE (well worth the money - and very reasonably priced) and everything I've had from here has been delicious.  I've only had take out, but am DYING to make it out to get the food fresh. In my opinion, if the take out is this good, this food must be AMAZING fresh. 

Household favorites include Chicken Marsala, Chicken Parmesan, Garlic Knots, and Tiramisu."}
{"text":"Chicken Piccate absolute delicious the flavor is wonderful.  SAUCE is good but I could have used another chicken breast not enough chicken for that huge plate of noodles n Extra...Definitely coming back!!! With hubby"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I went here a month or so back to watch walking dead at the restaurant. We LOVED IT. The waitress recommended the fried cheese with pepperoni and it was so good, we still talk about it! Our server was cute and peppy and had great recommendations on what we should try. Beautiful on the inside as well, they should be much busier than they are...doesn't seem right. But I know that particular location can't seem to keep a restaurant. I hope they stay!"}
{"text":"We won't be back anytime soon.  We were the only guests in the dining room.  The pasta is overpriced, as is the wine.  
The service was o.k. ...server not real familiar with menu, other than telling us everyting is made from scratch....maybe it is but this restaurant, just like others before will not make it!    Sorry"}
{"text":"Ordered from here one night when I was dogsitting at a friend's house. Ordered the pizza fries and chicken wings. Got to the house within 30 minutes (very quick!) the food was hot. The wings were decent, the pizza fries were AMAZING. Decent experience."}
{"text":"A welcome new addition to the void of quality restaurants in Galleria area, SAUCE delivers good food and a good bar.  This restaurant is limited to the food and dining.

I went with my daughter and my parental units, all foodies and all vocal when they have a good meal or a bad one.  While waiting for the rest of the party to arrive, my daughter and I shared a calamari appetizer.  Unfortunately this appetizer was not well prepared. The coating was light but had an aftertaste usually associated with a fryer that needs to be cleaned, and the calamari was too chewy.    

The bread was quite tasty and accompanied by oil/basalmic and pats of butter.  
Our waitress was very attentive and patient as we waited over 1/2 hour for the last two to arrive.  However as Sauce is less than 2 weeks old, there was some confusion over the daily soup, and the method of preparation and accompaniments.   I am certain over time this will resolve.

For dinner, I had the sausage potato soup and a shrimp salad and the rest of the party tried the chicken parm, shrimp scampi and sauced sea bass.  One of the things I was glad to see is the choose your sauce, choose your pasta, choose your topping section which had 5 or 6 sauces to choose from and several different pasta shapes.

The sausage potato soup was excellent with a lot of flavor.  The shrimp on my salad was cooked correctly and the salad was mixed greens and tomato with a few cucumber and onions for garnish.  The salad comes with oil and vinegar on it and the waitress did not give me a choice regarding having dressing or not, or alternative dressings.

My daughter loved the chicken parm and actually ate all of it while forgoing the majority of the pasta which means the chicken parm was really good because my daughter is the pasta queen and would eat it every meal if she was allowed.  My parents enjoyed their food very much. I tried the parm and found the chicken to be moist with a light breading and the sauce was good too.

They also have pizzas, sandwiches, and a kids menu which includes a peanut butter pizza.

I will admit I was hoping for a slightly more creative menu.  There really is nothing on this menu other than the homemade sauces that distinguishes it from any Italian restaurant.  I was hoping to see some more daring menu options or maybe more regional italian dishes.  That said, I think Sauce delivers on their menu so if you just want some good pizza and pasta, give it a shot."}
{"text":"Love this place!! my new favorite spot when i come to vegas.  Great food."}
{"text":"Zero if I could. Order food an hour ago and just got a call saying they don't have a delivery driver. It would have been my first time."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in, we were greeted right away! The service was excellent from the get-go. Our server, Matt, was very friendly and knowledgable. The drinks and delicious complimentary bread were brought out in a timely manner. The food was delicious and the drinks were consistently refilled. The dessert was amazing (tiramisu)! :) The ambiance is extremely cozy and kind of an old Vegas feel. Also, to my surprise, this restaurant has two very large private rooms. Great for a banquet or party!!! Worth checking out."}
{"text":"The other night we visited Sauce. It wasn't my first time here and I honestly had fantastic meals in my two previous visits. This time however, I feel Sauce fell a little short on a meal they should thrive on being their name is Sauce. 

When I saw Sauce was on Groupon, I was quick to purchase the deal at $18 for $30 worth of food, after all, I had great meals there. So the other night when we were too lazy to cook, we decided to revisit Sauce in Henderson near the Galleria Mall.

When we arrived we sat at the bar which was completely empty. It was a Thursday night so it was to be expected. The bartender was nowhere to be found but the owner or manager was very quick to attend to us. We ordered their in house beer which at $2 was a fair price. It's right in there with your Bud Lights and Coors Lights of the world. 

When it came time to order I realized they had a new, slimmed down menu which looked very nice. My two previous visits I had the open faced meatball sub and their pizza, both yummy! We started with their homemade garlic knots which are just fantastic. And for the main dish, this time I went with their build your own pasta dish which at $16.50 and at an Italian joint, I figured it was going to be rockin'! I ordered the creamy, grilled chicken fettuccine with roasted garlic. Sounds good right? The food came out and the presentation was fantastic. It looked great! The first mouth full, I felt I had to add salt, maybe some more basil? I wasn't exactly sure. The sauce was just bland. I was hungry so I did put a mean dent into the dish but I'm sorry to say, I will not be ordering pasta from there again.  Does this mean I will never return? No, I will be back but I will stick to what's safe, open faced meatball and pizza."}
{"text":"Wish I could leave zero stars after the horrible experience I had with Sauce last night. 

At 7 pm I placed a delivery order; Sauce stated a 90 minute wait time maximum. 2 hours later my boyfriend and I were still waiting for food and getting irritable. We started calling them numerous times. Their phones appeared to be off the hook or out of service and calls wouldn't go through. Boyfriend got on Facebook and sent them a message regarding this issue. 20 minutes later Sauce responded and claimed that \"It was the busiest night ever...our phones shorted out. Did you get your food yet?\" To which we said no. 

After total wait time of 2 hrs 40 minutes, which is absolutely unacceptable, the food finally arrived. The delivery guy said that the meal would still be charged in full. Refused the meal because at this point it would obviously be cold and we were forced to order food from a different place after the extensive wait. Boyfriend got on Facebook and sent Sauce a polite message explaining what had happened. Instead of apologizing or offering any type of reparation, Sauce responded that the situation was our fault because when the delivery guy showed up extremely late, he had an issue at our guard gate and was waiting to get in. Sauce claimed that he was waiting for 40 mins. Blatant lie, as I checked the call logs on my cell phone. We did miss a call from the guard gate but the delay on our end wasn't more than 10 minutes. 

I'm extremely disappointed with this experience, because we have tried Sauce delivery before with no issues and the food was pretty tasty. However, I will absolutely never order from them again. The delivery fee and food prices are already expensive; at that point you expect quality service. Ridiculous wait time with absolutely no apology on their end or offer to remedy the issues. Then lying about the situation and blaming us! Insane. Whoever is running the business obviously doesn't care about customer satisfaction- or keeping customers at all. And whoever is operating through their Facebook account should be given a lesson in how to manage problems like the one last night. Their response to what happened was completely out of line. Never again."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at @saucelv #saucelv their food was Slammin Good! I ordered the chicken marsala and garlic knots which both were very tasty.. I am very impressed by this place and will def be coming back to eat!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service, fun atmosphere!  This is our third trip here and food is half price on Wednesday for locals!  Big helpings and I can take leftovers home. My bill never made me so happy and we eat out allot. They hired all new servers to up the customer experience!  You could tell. We'll continue dining here!"}
{"text":"Waited on hold for 38 mins while I listened to a woman bartender complain about everything in her life! She answered, and told me to hold. She never came back to the phone?? What a joke!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times now. What keeps bringing me back? The food. The first time we ordered one of their signature appetizers, the pepperoni cheese bites. They were wayyyy over done. The next 3 times we went we got pizza and the charred and fried wings. I must say these menu items are on point.

So why only 2 stars? Well... Each time we've gone in it has been pretty quiet. Maybe 4-8 other people total in the whole place, and this place is huge. There's a dining area, a bar dining area, the bar, a pool table area, music area and so on. Usually we sit at the bar to get the happy hour specials, which are great btw. I've seen at least 3 people working in the kitchen area, 1-2 bartenders, 1-3 hostesses, and 1 dining room server. You would think that considering how few people are actually there ordering food or drinks versus how many employees there are that we would be acknowledged pretty quickly but no, that's not the case.

The bartenders seem to not care about making tips at all. No conversation happens between the bartenders/servers and the patrons. Which makes me wonder... Do I look like someone who wouldn't tip well? Because that's not the case at all. In fact I get tips in my own job and know that excellent customer service is what assures a great tip. I also believe in tip karma and tend to overtip bc of this. But I also know when it's necessary to leave a small tip to get the point across. 

The times we've gone in late the staff seems even more annoyed than ever. They can't be bothered to bring my drink over to the pool table or ask me how I am doing. It's as if I don't exist if I show up after 9pm. I did notice they start setting up for some sort of after hours joint. I think they focus more on what they will make then, instead of ensuring ALL customers enjoy their experience at Sauce no matter what the hour. I shouldn't have to move out of the way while playing pool because you feel the need to adjust the tables and put the VIP rope over an inch another 3x. I feel like I am ushered out of the door quicker than I can finish a beer so they can bring in their \"VIP\" for the night. Speaking of which... Is it really necessary to have to block out all your front parking spots at 7pm when your after hours doesn't start til midnight??

While we were playing pool the short haired blonde server was stirring up all kinds of drama literally right in front of us. She was using all sorts of cuss words and everything. I cuss like a sailor, but when you are on the job I suggest you watch the way you're talking around your clientele. She called someone a \"wh*re\"... Also I walked into the bathroom only to find her and one of the other employees in a locked stall together. It was really uncomfortable and to top it off they were talking crap about another employee. After they realized someone else walked in they hurried out of the bathroom and didn't wash their hands. Even if you aren't handling the food directly you should be washing your hands!!! I have no idea why they would need to be in a locked stall together with an empty bar like that... But it was peculiar to say the least. Bad taste and so awkward.

So to sum this all up... The food is on point usually.. But the service leaves something to be desired. I wish it wasn't so bad because I live so close and they do have a comedy night and live music but I have yet to show up to those because of the employees bad attitudes and behavior. I only hope the owner gives a crap about this place so we can see it get better instead of closing down like all of the other places that have before them."}
{"text":"Homemade Italian delivered to your door, what's not to love? I got spaghetti and meatballs and it was delicious! The meatballs were so soft and flavorful!"}
{"text":"Easy thing to say that this building (Old Spaghetti Factory) has had a long history of being cursed... I think Sauce is here to break that curse!

We walked in on a late Friday afternoon, this place is HUGE. Tons of restaurant seating available, large bar, lounge type seating near the pool tables, and a back room for live music and karaoke. We were greeted promptly by the bartender, and were given happy hour pricing even though we were a tad early (not quite 4pm yet). She was easy to talk to and let us know about all their events going on and coming up. Fridays are Karaoke night and Saturdays are live music nights! Some themed nights are on the calendar as well!

Rich, the owner, was quick to come see our large group. He is an awesome individual.. not the kind of owner you meet who's gonna brown nose his customers and be fake and smiley. Rich was true and authentic, not shy of who he is. One can say that an owner should be sucking up to clientele, but I think authenticity will bring people back!

We spent most our time watching the ball games on for the day, plenty of TVs surrounding the bar, a perfect place to go for the games and no hesitation from staff when we asked for a different game on the TV we were watching.  

For food, we only ordered appetizers from the HH menu since we had already eaten: spinach-artichoke dip, fried cheese, and a personal pizza. I loved the spinach dip, hot and gooey with visible spinach & artichoke hearts with cooked pizza dough (i think) for dipping. Fried cheese isn't plain ol' mozz sticks, its provolone wrapped pepperoni and then fried and then placed on a plate with marinara (I believe?) and pesto cream sauce. The pizza was inhaled down the bar, so I didn't get to partake. 

I can't give a 5 star yet because our visit was centralized around the bar. I look forward to trying their entrees on the menu and for some of their live music nights. I have a good feeling about Sauce. Just what the neighborhood needs: genuine people, yummy food, full beers, and a little bit of nightlife fun."}
{"text":"Went here tonight cause we had a Groupon and that was one of the worst Gorupon we have ever had. 

First: The waitress Kelly had zero personality, I ordered a Summer's Shandy and she brings me a Miler Light. 

Second: The appetizer was a frozen bagged Arrincini, it was mush in the middle and not even good.

Third: Kelly brings over the pizza and small saucers, never have I ever see this. She off no cheese, red pepper nothing. She does not even bring a pizza cutter for us, so we used the butter night. 

I dont think we will ever go back, from the moment we sat down to the to the time Kelly left for the day, Gerta took over out table and it was much better to see a smile on a servers face.  It was a horrible experience. Very poor service (Kelly) and food. Was hoping it would better."}
{"text":"If you could give a place negative stars I would , I placed an order from eats 24 . Est time was 50-60 , the order was placed at 9:30 then it was extended to 2hrs a delivery of 11:02 pm and after 11:45 my  food  didn't arrive the restaurant closed . my order was finally cancelled by eats  after 2hrs and 45 min . My order arrived after midnight , it was incorrectly made had tomatoes that I'm allergic to. Noting in the order was even ordered with tomatoes . I'm having an allergic reaction to it and there is no one to take responsibility ."}
{"text":"First time into sushi Kaizen was a great surprise! The restaurant is comfortable and has a great atmosphere. The rolls taste so fresh! And were made very artfully by the chefs. Mm garlic edamame and mussels too."}
{"text":"another amazing night the bartender was very pleasant we a few small bites and drinks I don't know why that place as I have more people I guess they need the gambling very bad that's right in Vegas a bar without gambling surprised it survived for over 2 years
Will be back have a great deals"}
{"text":"1st thing-the Pesto Cream Sauce is AMAZING! Wow! We decided to try this place being hesitant based on the Yelp reviews. Oh and it's Valentines Day. 
The place was almost dead for VDay. Not good for them but score for us. We were greeted promptly and our server was great the entire meal! The food came out in a timely manner. So 5 stars for all the basics. 
My son had the Garlic Alfredo Fries that were different but a great surprise. We also ordered a pizza. The crust is different than most but very good. It's more thick crust and bread like. Now, back to that Pesto Cream sauce pasta....wow! Best pasta I've had. I added Chicken to my pasta and it was so tender and yummy as well. 
I took off 1 star based on the owners are just lacking some basic business things. Maybe they got tired. The entrance is junky with poles, you have to walk by a small open storage room, no drink menus on the table and just other little things. I hope they get it together. Maybe have a fresh set of eyes come in for a review."}
{"text":"Service was great, but the food was only so-so.  I had the Cesar salad and the dressing was super bland."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews, chose to try something new. Regret. Took two hours for delivery- to get cold pizza, cold garlic knots with no garlic, and hot salad. Fail."}
{"text":"I always look at reviews before trying a place....and I must say some of these people are wayyyyy too harsh.
So you have a gluten allergy, why don't you go and cook for yourself so you know there are no contaminants?

First of all, this is a newer business and they are still gaining clientele, so before you walk in and say, where is everybody? You should realize how uncalled for that is and just check it out for yourself with an open mind.

Second of all, I've been going to Sauce for a year now and I've never had an issue. The bartenders are great, Chris and Don know how to rock it and give great service. There's only a few servers but they are great as well. 

Thirdly, the food quality is fantastic. The pizza is NOT out of the freezer quality for those of you who claim this. They are willing to modify items if needed and it always comes out in a timely fashion. The food is Italian fusion so you can try new things like an Italian chimichanga. 

Over all I definitely recommend this place for take out or dine in. 
They have weekly deals too so you can enjoy even better prices, like 1/2 off locals day on Wednesday. 

Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"The food here is great. I have been all over the world, Germany, France, Italy and so on but the pizza here is so good. The garlic knots are also good and not super over powered because I don't like that much garlic. 

The staff is very friendly and learns your name and what you like to drink if you come at least once a month. This is my cheat day restaurant to go have some drinks and pizza I devour. Prices are great as well."}
{"text":"My friend told me about this place about a month ago, I drove by and seen no cars ! I was like okay I gave it a try, can't go wrong with $4 Long Islands all day, everyday. They were so delicious and our bartenders Don and Lisa were amazing !! I got hungry and ordered a Caesar Salad, this salad was huge !!! My friend and I split it along with the BBQ Chicken Pizza. I was satisfied the time I left, nice and full and had a delicious drink. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting a drink and to watch a variety of sports !! It's definitely my go to spot. I recently found out they deliver !!!!!! I can't wait to place my order, thank you Sauce !!!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but nothing wow'd us. Would not return. The service has a lot of opportunity for improvement.  Our server was unattentive. She didn't bring salad dressing. She also didn't check in after the food was served. We had to ask another server to bring cheese. 
I did not like the dining area. To large and cavernous."}
{"text":"Just to the point, the chef needs to go back to cooking school and the owner needs to learn how to run a successful business. I believe is just matter of time before they go out of business. The service was very poor and the taste of the food horrible. We didn't finish our meal that's how horrible our food was.
The worst part to us was the sauce."}
