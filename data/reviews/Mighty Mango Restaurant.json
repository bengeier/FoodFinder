{"text":"First time trying mighty mango, we ordered delivery on Christmas day. Service on the phone was amazing, the man I spoke to was pleasant and helpful. Being Christmas I expected that we may have to wait a while as I know if I was working on Christmas, I would be slacking!  The food arrived quicker than the 40 mins the man said it would take.  The food was delicious and the portions were huge!!! Price was exactly what most Chinese food restaurants charge ($11/ish per container) but portions were as I said.....  HUGE!  Will definitely order again and would recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's a very quiet restaurant but we always enjoy the service and the good food.   Some amazing suggestions:  - Egg drop soup. I have never had anything so amazing as this soup. It's also low calorie for you health conscious types.  - Beef and broccoli. The beef is cooked perfectly to melt in our mouth! The way beef was intended.  - Veggie Sizzling Rice. I'm personally not a vegetarian but the boyfriend used to be one and this is his favourite dishes. I really do enjoy this dish. Never thought I would enjoy tofu! Weird....  - Ginger Beef. YUM.  - Crispy Wontons. Very good but make you have a large group to share with because they give you a good helping.  - Almond Chicken. YUM!  A great place to dine. And even better if you need to take your girlfriend out on a last second Valentine's date and you didn't make a reservation. Hint hint. :)"}
{"text":"Craving Chinese, we needed to try something different. \"Let's check on Yelp,\"she suggested as we quickly perused the nearby offerings. That was a good decision. Our bad decision was writing down every dish that other Yelpers had admired at Mighty Mango and then ordering them all! Had we simply gone with our usual Chinese food selections I am convinced this would have been a sterling dinner. Instead, it was a confused collection of things that sounded a lot better in everyone else's' review. Many items were deep fried (but rather tasty). We did discover a dish that was not only new to us but which will now form a part of our basic order in the future, hot and sour soup on sizzling rice...but don't take my word for it."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The portions were amazing. Truly amazing! Great value.  I can't say the taste was out of this world but it was much better than many other places in the city. I will definitely make a visit again..."}
{"text":"I have only ever done take out here, and I order the same thing every time.  Dry spare ribs - they are AMAZING, I recommend getting them. Chicken fried rice- let me tell you, they are not cheap, I don't know how they filled the container to rim like that but it was stuffed. Good rice also. Ginger beef- they should warn you on the menu but don't. The ginger beef is spicy, not mild spicy, real spicy.  Sweet and sour pork- amazing as well, no surprises when you bite into it. However they use both white meat and dark meat.   I've ate here twice and been please with the food and staff encounters.  I've recently started ordering the salt and peper chicken, and bubble teas, SO GOOD. I think they use msg though..."}
{"text":"Great friendly service Amazingly delicious food that keeps you wanting more!  Huge portions so you will definitely be asking for a take away box Cozy & clean ambience, truly a gem! I can't wait to order for delivery next time!"}
{"text":"Mighty Mango is a hidden gem.  We stopped for lunch and everything was so good.  It was the best ginger beef I've had in a long time.  The sweet and sour pork and chop suey were also awesome.  The service was fast and friendly.  We'll be going back for sure.  Can't wait to check out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Went for chinese for lunch, short menu, 2 dishes with fried rice and egg for $9.50, had beef with brocolli in black bean and chicken chow mein, both nice, rice kind plain but fit well with the other dishes. All served on one plate  Looked at the take out and dinner menu, huge selection of Thai food dishes., this is a thai restaurant with a few chinese dishes.   Next time I am going for the thai!  Music was refreshing, not loud, not \"chinese\", just relaxing.   Service was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"This little hidden gem has some of the best Chinese food in Calgary. It is never very busy; but that is due to the location. It is pretty far south, but well worth the drive. The ginger beef melts in your mouth, the sizzling rice full of flavor, the beef and broccoli delicious and so tender you barely have to chew. Deep Fried Won-tongs light, crispy, breathtaking; no one does them even close to how the Mango does them,. Mushu pork is another great dish......I could go on and on......  The staff are friendly and you feel like home. Defiantly check this place out!"}
{"text":"We've ordered takeout from here once seeing as its near where we live, and we found it to be nothing out of the ordinary. The food was still good, but I've had similar Chinese food elsewhere. A good pick if you're looking for good, easy Chinese takeout... but nothing that makes it stand out from the others."}
{"text":"Their hot and sour soup is good . Lots of veggies and pork and good portion size . I'll visit again to try out the rest of menu."}
{"text":"Well done the Mighty Mango! I went on a rainy Saturday little after two and even though it was past the time the woman agreed to let me order a lunch special to go.  I got beef chop suey, which is beef and bean sprouts, ginger chicken over fried rice. Fried rice was enjoyable with some peas, bits of fried egg and a good consistency. The ginger beef was awesome: sweet and crispy. The bean sprouts in the chop suey were healthy and cooked just right. She give me chilli oil, chopsticks and fortune cookie! The price of the lunch special was $10. Also, I didn't have to wait too long.  Lunch specials aren't available every day but there are other dishes that look worth trying.   So close to my house, very delicious and with great service, I'm raising my grade for the Mighty Mango!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out from the Mighty Mango.   As far as Chinese restaurants go, their dishes were the standard fare.   We ordered ginger beef and a few other dishes.  Overall everything was really tasty, wasn't the BEST I'd ever had, but I've had much worse."}
