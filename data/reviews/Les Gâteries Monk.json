{"text":"Très mauvaise expérience à cet endroit. Mauvais service (café ordinaire servi sans cuillère, ni lait, pas de serviettes de table), nourriture froide, serveur trop timide à qui il faut tout demander. Il y a du travail à faire! Les belles photos et beaux sites Internet ne suffisent parfois pas. Bonne chance!"}

{"text":"Les Gâteries Monk opened about 2 months ago, replacing a coffee bistro which had closed its doors at the same location a year before. A resident in Côte-St-Paul/Ville-Émard, I had found myself without a decent coffee shop at proximity since I moved to the calm neighborhood last summer... until now!

As the name entails, Les Gâteries Monk primarily serves cakes, pastries, sandwiches, crepes and omelettes, but it is also a coffee shop; the only one of its kind on Monk Street, a street which I hear used to be active but that fell into decay a few years ago. So if this new coffee shop can rise from the ashes of Monk Street, there is hope!

The shop deserves a solid 3 stars, not quite reaching the 4 stars mark yet however. The carrot cake is great, and so is the breakfast sandwich according to my husband, but the coffee is just above average. The Americano, although fair, was diluted with too much water, and the Mocha tasted alright but lacked espresso/coffee and was overall not too memorable. 

The service was very courteous but on the slow side; the staff will need to speed up if they ever get more regular customers. I'm willing to wait but most busy people will not find 5 to 10 minutes of idle time acceptable.

We're still thrilled to have a coffee shop within proximity, the closest alternative being half an hour away walking; great on a warm summer day, not so great during winter!

We'll be back for sure, but as it currently stands, Les Gâteries Monk doesn't stand among the hall of fame of Montreal's coffee shops."}
