{"text":"Great food and wine, band is a great touch, although if you want to eat and talk, choose the dining room, not the bar."}
{"text":"Sapori's has the best eggplant parmesan ever!!!  THE BEST!  The flavor is amazing!!!  I also enjoyed the warm mushroom salad.  5 stars for the food and the excellent service in this quaint little restaurant off the beaten path."}
{"text":"Had an enjoyable dinner & wine for valentines day. 
Staff was great, food was great and served promptly. Will go back."}
{"text":"We loved it. The food was delis. The kitchen and staff very attentive. The prices very  appropriate foe the quality. The only improvement needed is the decor needs polishing ie: curtains, walls decor, plants, patio, etc"}
{"text":"Amazing service - delicious food - personable chef - accommodating to our year and a half son - great cozy decor! Can't say enough great things about everything we had - and not too hard on the wallet! Go go go!"}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow. Server a bit inattentive. Food was just ok, but not great. We asked for more bread 3x and finally got it as we were packing up to leave. Sodas were watered down tasting. Service and food not up to par with the prices they charge."}
{"text":"Great service, and great food. The wine was delicious and the food was so good and fulling."}
{"text":"This restaurant has me torn in regard whether to go back or not... I have been to Sapori roughly five times, obviously because the food is good. I get the Chicken Frances every time and it is always excellent.
The issue is that I can't sit in the restaurant without hearing whining and complaining from the staff. I went back tonight (late afternoon). They were having issues with their internet and it was affecting their credit card / ordering system. I was there for roughly an hour and the manager sat at the bar arguing with the their provider the whole time, in total disregard of customers. She would get up and walk around the dining room area saying \"why does this have to be my headache\". It was uncomfortable and she should have handled that in an office as much as possible.
The time before this visit the same manager was having personal conversations next to the water station where I was sitting. 
There was also an instance where they didn't change their \"open hours\" board that sits outside the restaurant. It said that they opened at 4 on Saturdays when they really didn't open until 5.
We went in and the hostess said she wasn't sure what to tell me... We came back at 5 and ate. I drove by on my way home following week and they still hadn't changed the board haha!
I honestly think that this staff really just doesn't care to much.
I get the impression that ownership / general manager, if there is one, is worried about losing staff and not customers..."}
{"text":"Overall, a very good first experience. All the food we ordered was very good. A highlight was the pasta e fagioli soup of the day. It was obviously homemade, with the \"beany\" broth of the real thing, and not too much pasta. It was the perfect way to start a cold winter night's dinner! My wife had the house salad and I had the half-portion of the Greek salad. Both were nicely sized, and the Greek salad was particularly tasty, with ample amounts of kalamata olives and chopped cucumber. For our entrees, my wife had the salmon special, which she enjoyed, and I had the chicken Scarpariello. The red sauce on my wife's pasta side was very good. My portion was very large, with big chunks of sausage, and two thinly-pounded pieces of chicken breast. The sauce packed a spicy punch and was full of saut√©ed onions and sliced cherry peppers (the source of the heat). My only complaint was that it was a bit oily (although perfect for mopping up with the delicious warm bread served at the table).

Sapori has a very interesting menu, and there were many tough choices to make. This is always a good problems to have, as it will ensure our return!

The one odd thing about Sapori is the stark contrast between the two dining rooms. The front room (the one to ask for, particularly if making a reservation in advance) has exposed brick, large windows, and many photos on the walls. It is warm and cozy. The other room is very plain, cold, and devoid of character. That is where we were initially seated. If there was not an open table in the front room at which to be reseated, we definitely would have left."}
{"text":"Great service combined with great Italian food warrants my high rating. Multiple servers checked on us to make sure our needs and expectations were being met. Meals at our table included the Gnocchi, Veal Marsala and Gorgonzola Penne pasta. This was my second visit here and felt the experience worthy of a review."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise, tucked away in an old strip mall. Lovely decor, delicious food, comfortable seating, decent prices, and competent, friendly service. We tried the DeMedici pizza, some of the house wines, and the warm mushroom salad. They were all very good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a nice family owned Italian place. It's kinda small but quaint. The food is really good. My one wish is they would have a tomato cream sauce or mix of marinara-Alfredo and also that the prices would be a bit lower. Nice selection though and tasty fresh bread.  Would go back again and again."}
{"text":"You have to try this.  Portions are generous and quality is fantastic. Very attentive service and a great atmosphere. Made our night."}
{"text":"We did not have a good experience at this restaurant. We had reservations for 7:30 on a Friday night for a party of 11. It was not busy and we were sat right away. The waitress might have been new or inexperienced but we struggled all evening to get our drinks refilled and to get our food in a timely manner. The orders came out 1 or 2 at a time and spanned approximately 20 minutes. The first people probably got their meal after 30-35 minutes. There were now 3 people bringing food out and another waiter filling water glasses and it still took that long although the chef disputes this(see below)
I asked for more bread and more was brought to the other end of the table. When I saw our waitress again I asked if we could also get more bread and she rudely told me 'it's coming'. Well, when it came it was so hard, it wasn't edible.
When the bill came, I wrote a note on the receipt that it was the worst service I've ever had. Of course this brought out the owner? Not sure if it was owner or manager but he was also the chef. He asked what the problem was and when I told him, without actually saying it...called me a liar. Wonderful dining experience...not...for our last evening of a wonderful wedding week!
Needless to say my review is 
It's too bad because the food is actually pretty good."}
{"text":"John was an amazing server. Super attentive  but not overbearing. He also brought extra sauce on the side which was so nice to have for my pasta (because I asked for easy sauce). Also the food was frickin phenomenal. We will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"This is a awesome Italian restaurant. The best food we have had at an Italian restaurant in a really long time. You can tell they care about the quality of their food. The service was excellent as well. My husband got the lasagna which was delicious and I got the chicken parm which was also great. They have the best sauce. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is soooo good! Service was excellent, food very good. Music on Friday nights is great!  Go there!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! There were four of us dining and everything about our meal was delicious. We were dining on a Friday night so just a small suggestion, have the band play a little softer from 7p-8p so we can still hear our dinner conversation. The service was a little slow but certainly the food was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Came for nephew's college grad. The strips are thick and well prepared. Quality cuts. Had ribeye here too.  Great. The scallops.. OH MY GOD..THEY'RE CLEMENTINE ORANGE SIZED AND SUPERB. Ribs...What a suprise. Massive slabs fell off bone slow cooked. Yah, I know ribs at an italian joint...YES SIR!! And if you are lunching try one of the best burgers I have ever had. Again ...burger in an italian joint?  Yup. I get a beautiful salad instead of fries ti behave..but the rosemary fries are divine.   
 And the berries foster for dessert. Truly unique. Enough for the 4 to share."}
{"text":"Great experience!!!!!!!!!! Excellent food and wine!!!!!! Joe made this a wonderful  evening. Wewill definitely be regulars. Tom avonlake"}
{"text":"This is dinning.
The absolute best experience in love music and dining. May 15, 2015 Becky Boyd sang her heart out. Jim Wall on drums, Michael Bay playing lead guitar and Alfrado Guererri bring Rhythm and Blues to the best meal prepared by Chef Joe.

Highly suggested by my wife and I
Bon Appitite"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious dinner here with a group of 20 or so.  Food was delicious - I had the Sapori  ravioli - goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes - oh so so so very good!!!  Nice to have a separate room where we could hear each other.  Looking forward to going back - took a cannoli home for my husband and he wouldn't share!  :)"}
{"text":"The best selection of red wines I've seen in a while. The strip steak was delicious. The owner came over and we had a good discussion of wines and liquor selections. Be sure to set reservations on the weekends or you might be out of luck for the entire evening."}
{"text":"Sapori Italian Grille is among the finest new(er) restaurants in the Cleveland area.  Excellent Italian options are complemented by great meat and seafood entrees.  Friendly staff and awesome dessert options make Sapori an amazing dining experience.  The restaurant's building was once an interurban station for the Lake Shore Electric Railway - and some of Sapori's artwork reflects that history."}
{"text":"My friend and I had an early dinner here tonight and it was sooooo good! Our server was very personable, polite and efficient. We started with the sausage stuffed pepper and pasta fagioli soup...both delicious! We chose entrees Chicken Marsala and the Chicken Francese up charged ( only 2.00 ) to alfredo for the pasta and......YUM! Both dishes were amazing! We each took 1/2 home, so looking forward to lunch tomorrow! The chef came out to ask how everything was and found he was the owner as well. Nice touch! Reasonable prices, high quality meal, great service, nice room, clean surroundings. Looking forward to my next trip!"}
{"text":"Dined here again last evening and, as always, was more than satisfied!  Service was a bit slower than usual due to a call-off last minute but I am never in a hurry when I dine out so this was okay with our party.  Wine came out nicely chilled, hot bread, olive oil and cheese to dip in (I asked for this) and butter, too.  I asked if Chef Joe could make me a simple ceasar salad with a nice salmon filet and he did and it was delicious!!! That salmon was so good!  One person in the party had her favorite, the Sapori ravioli and the other had the veal parmesan with pasta.  Joe and Kelly, the owners, along with their staff do a great job and it's always a pleasure dining here!  Love Sapori!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after reading the good reviews. What a shock. Not sure if the food is good as we never made it that far. 
I made reservations for 7pm on Saturday. We arrived and were greeted by a troubled high school aged girl arguing with the credit card machine. 
We stepped to the side by the bar where you could see into the kitchen. They were frantic in there. The entire restaurant was heavy in smoke from burned bread or something in the oven too long. They could use a better ventilation system in the kitchen. Also witnessed a worker in the kitchen lift his shirt to wipe his face with it, his bare large belly inches away from plates of food. Ewww
After waiting for just a minute she pointed at us and said \"you, come on\", I saw the daggers from my wife's eyes at that point. When making the reservation it was the last one available, but there were several empty tables in the restaurant, seemed strange. I quickly learned why. 
We were seated and handed menus. The hostess walked away and no one ever returned. Several waitresses continued to walk by and made eye contact but never said hello, be right back, get your own water, or anything. We saw a table that had eaten an entire basket of bread and empty glasses of water finally have their drink order taken and told that if they wanted food it would be 40 mins since the kitchen was busy. 
A table behind us had finished eating, an entire plate of food was left, waitress asked if they wanted to take it with them they said no, it was terrible and they couldn't eat it. No offer to take it off the bill. The waitress obviously never stopped back after delivering the food until the end of meal. They then tried to order dessert to the waitresses dismay, she returned and said it would take a really long time and they should probably just go. 
A table of 4 older people were sitting on the other side commenting on all of the goings on. Apparently several other tables had left without ordering prior to our arrival. They were also pointing out that my wife and I had been sitting for quite some time without being acknowledged. They had finished eating and said their food was very good. 
We had enough and got up to leave. The older people said \"good for you\" and \"we don't blame you.\"  
We stopped and let the rude girl know that we were leaving. One of the waitresses overheard us say we had not been acknowledged and that we were treated rudely. She rolled her eyes and offered no apology. 
There are way too many good restaurants around the area to be treated this way. I don't care if the food is good, this place will never see my business. 
They need a manager that knows how to run a restaurant and how to provide service if they want a chance of surviving. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"In the last few months, I have become a regular at this restaurant. You will be hard-pressed to find an Italian spot in the area or anywhere on the west side of Cleveland that is as good. Joe, the owner and chef, is a master of bringing out flavors. I have eaten a lot of the food on their menu and have yet to have a bad dish. The ones that standouts for me are the Warm Mushroom Salad, the Lobster Ravioli, the Sea Bass, and his Ribeye Steak.

The Warm Mushroom Salad might be my favorite salad ever. The savoriness of the mushrooms, the sweet tartness of the dried cranberries and the creaminess of the goat cheese just blend so well. Love it.

The lobster ravioli is so great. The cream sauce and hint but not overpowering flavor of lobster make a great combination. Best thing is you can get this as a meal or as an appetizer!

Their sea bass is simple yet amazing. Joe knows how to highlight the bring out the flavors of this fish without going overboard with seasoning.

The ribeye...oh man. If you like a well-marbled and aged steak, this is where you should go. I recommend getting it blackened. The flavor is amazing and I have never finished the whole thing (and I can eat). So good!

I rarely eat at the same restaurant more than once a month and I eat here almost every week (which from Berea is a bit of a drive). I strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic every time! Menu is full of tasteful well priced items. Been here many times and the quality is always top notch the $8 lunch menu is right on point"}
{"text":"Food was good, not great. A little pricey, entrees don't even come with a salad. Our waitress was a little inattentive. Only good thing is got right in and sat down, no wait! Oh the fresh bread is good too..."}
{"text":"Best chef in the area. This vegetarian chef is easy to trust (because I cannot have meat) and an artist! He still creates meat dishes that I hear are to die for and on each of my visits the food always impresses me. Even though have it twice a week! Thanks Kelley, Joe, and Kristi for making my week!!"}
{"text":"It was such a pleasure and very refreshing for a change making reservations at Sapori. Actually it was the best reservation experience I have ever had!!!! Angelina was so friendly, great natured, enthusiastic and helpful. She described the three different dining areas we could choose from including the patio. She spoke to me respectfully and spoke by using my first name, after I called back and mentioned we were running late. Kudos to Angelina!!!! I give Sapori an A+ on reservations and friendliness. Sapori is a lovely little Italian restaurant. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is very inviting. The food quality is excellent, however I believe they do not use real butter which ruined the taste of our perfectly cooked food including the bread. The homemade sliced crusty bread came out piping hot and steaming which was unlike any other restaurant.  An A+ on the bread!! We were so excited but soon became disappointed after we put the so called butter on it.  The butter tasted like butter you would put on popcorn at the movies. The pasta was good and even tasted homemade, but way too much of the fake butter combo. My salmon was cooked perfectly and had a great taste minus the entirely too much fake butter and salt. My husbands Chicken Marsala was good, but his  pasta would have been excellent minus the fake butter. Asparagus and squash were excellent!! Drinks were not strong, so stick with wine and beer. No taps, only bottles. Didn't want to try dessert in fear of disappointment."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our meal, great food and great service.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Their food is amazing!
Have eaten here several times and always had a delicious dinner
HOWEVER...... trying to contact someone to arrange for a large birthday party celebration was a nightmare!!!
So very rude not to respond to a text, phone call, then email is poor customer service
All I needed was a yay or nay
Thanks for nothing
I will not be eating here again!


Excuse me but I did call back the next day as I said I would
Got a voicemail (in Italian that). Sent a response via email and texted
No one ever replied to any of those 3 things
I will NOT remove my review as it is 100% accurate!"}
{"text":"This is a great place! The indoor red brick with archways and small dining area were cozy and visually appealing. There seemed to be another possible seating area but maybe that was used for large groups. 
    We took my mother in law here for her birthday, and she made a wonderful choice! The food was outstanding! The start of crusty warm bread. Worth the trip just for the bread. We ordered calamari and fried mozzarella nothing frozen here. The fresh mozzarella dipped and fried was crunchy on the outside and gooey on the inside. The fried calamari was plentiful and delicious. 
Entrees were generous and fabulous. Sister tried the sea scallops, but they were at the end of the lot so chef approached and told us the situation and sis accepted scallops over pasta for the price of pasta. Very nice. 
Mom ordered chicken Marsala which had sweet Marsala and maybe baby Bella's. She said it was wonderful. Hubby ordered the ribeye rare. Best piece of meat stateside in a long time. Served with pasta and veggies. If you go home hungry, it's on you. I ordered thee Chilean sea bass which was exquisite with alfredo pasta.  

Service was friendly and informal. This lends to the charm of the dining experience. We appreciated the personal communication with the chef."}
{"text":"I went last week and was very disappointed. The reviews were very good so I was expecting better. The service is very very slow. I had the pasta with seafood and the pasta was way undercooked. I like it al dente but this was very undercooked. All the seafood was overcooked, the shrimp was very tough and the calamari was so tough I had to put it aside."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area from Las Vegas and after reading the reviews were eager to try this place. My husband and I went in there tonight around 6:15 for our Friday night date night and were asked if we had a reservation...we did not (no idea we needed one based on the website)...hostess told us to hold on...came back and said her manager said she couldn't seat us without a reservation until after 7:00...the place did not look busy at all and the entire front area was empty. Highly disappointed and will be a while until we go back to try again.  Don't go without making a reservation first."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! I just discovered this little gem. The staff is friendly, and they go above and beyond to make you feel welcomed. The meals I have enjoyed here have exceeded my expectations. They also have a great wine selection. I highly recommend this place if you want great service, great food, and great wine. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Nice location in Avon lake. Outdoor and indoor seating available. They take reservations. The kitchen is visible. They have a bar and can make drinks of your choice. They however have a good wine list. The service was efficient for a Saturday night. The restaurant was busy up until 8pm. The cosmopolitan was tasty on the other hand the margarita was a little dry and strong. The bread with butter was fresh. The wine bottle was good but a little expensive for $37. The cocktails were $9.50 each. 
They have a lot of vegetarian options. The pastas are priced around $16-$17 and additional for chicken or shrimp. The portion size are huge. Split plate charge is only $1. 
The capellini pasta was tad bit oily. The chicken Marsala was tasty. 
2 people in the party had upset stomach the same night. Not sure why!
Overall a good place to visit if you are in Avon lake and wish for an Italian outing. 
Do drive on lake road and enjoy the nice houses by the lake!"}
{"text":"Cute, quaint & casual little Italian joint. The food is AWESOME! Seriously authentic and delicious... everything. For appys, we tried the calamari (so good with the banana peppers) and the stuffed banana peppers (hands down one of the best things I have ever tasted!!!) Scallops were cooked to perfection and the spaghetti and meatballs were everything you could ever want in that dish. Everything on the menu looked/ sounded incredible- we had a hard time narrowing it down when ordering. Im totally going back the next time I'm craving Italian!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want a great home cooked Italian meal! No high sodium processed Olive Garden crap. Everything was exceptional! We got the stuffed peppers for an appetizer, sapori ravioli and chicken Francese. The sauces were home made deliciousness and nothing was left on the plate. We ate everything! They are not stingy with their bread! We had three baskets. A true hidden gem of an Italian restaurant!"}
{"text":"So very disappointing. I called 2 weeks in advance to make reservation for 14 for a birthday party. Manager/phone person??  said she would have chef/owner call me to discuss possible menu specials for that night. Never happened. I called a week before to confirm reservation was in place, I should have been concerned then when it took her a while to find it and then had the wrong numbers. Same person was impatient/rude when a guest called to see if she would be allowed to bring in some table decorations and cake  for the party. 
We were set up in a semi private area, which had a musty smell. 
 We had ONE waitress for all 14 at the table. As a result we had to wait a good length of time for everyone to be served cocktails. Same with appetizers. Entrees were even worse, some guests had finished eating when others still hadn't been served. Most of the food was cold or incomplete, but no one wanted to complain and have to wait even longer. Drinks were weak and/or watered down. 
 Forget things like second drinks, extra bread. One waitress (young girl at that) could only do so much. 
We were so fed up, that we ended up taking cake back to house to serve, because it wasn't worth having to wait even longer for it to be served. 
Place was not crowded. When one of our guests asked for wifi access , the manager? came to the table to bemoan her internet issues and credit card processing problems. Not the entertainment we had planned for the birthday. And it is not as if they didn't know in advance the number in our party so they could staff accordingly."}
{"text":"The place is very quaint, but lacking in attentiveness. Two different people finally took our drink order after waiting quite some time and they said our real waitress would be with us shortly. It wasn't busy at all and only two other tables with people at about 6:00pm. The waitress finally came out and never told us the specials as we heard her tell other tables. We probably would of ordered something different. I had to go find the waitress to get our order in. They tend to go to the other end of the restaurant and ignore you ... this has happened on a few prior visits but tonight was the worst. Having  eaten at many Italian restaurants the food here is just mediocre.  I will not be returning as I feel I've given them plenty of chances."}
{"text":"We had a lovely and relaxing family dinner on the patio, delicious food thoughtfully prepared and served with charm. As we were leaving we decided to ask Joe to cater a holiday event in a few days, which he agreed to. He came in specially to do it; it was hot and fresh and on time, adhered to our family's crazy dietary needs, and our guests - literally - ate it up. (The ribs especially!) Our whole experience with this chef and his restaurant was top notch."}
{"text":"WOW.  WOW is all I could say for about the first 5 minutes, UNTIL I asked about wines and the head chef, Joe came out to talk to us about some menu items and wine pairings.  He's from the area so he understands what we Cleveland-Lorain residents like to eat.

I asked about the rack of lamb, and as soon as he said \"Lebanese rub\", I stopped him and immediately ordered a full rack.  5 chops came out, and I was NOT dissapointed.  I've tasted lamb from all over the world, and this is some of the best I've ever had, including what my family raised me on.

I had a Romanian sweet wine that was so good I had 2 glasses (and I don't drink wine).  My good woman had a ribeye steak with a semi-dry red that went perfect.  Desserts as well, and it was a night to remember.  

I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant, with reservations, if you want a romantic dinner, you're looking for the best food in the county, or you are trying to impress someone.  This is the place you'd want to come to.  I made a reservation online with an app for restaurant reservations, same day, and had no problems at all.  I will come visit here each time I come home now!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants! Excellent service and phenomenal Italian cuisineHighly recommended! Try the Eggplant bambini"}
{"text":"After returning from a trip,  Sat. 4/25 my wife & I decided to dine at Sapori's. I called to see if we needed reservations. The person answering said no, This was about 7:30.  (Person seemed annoyed we were dining late) We arrived about 8:20. We were seated & did not see a server for 20 min. I got up to leave and that's when the staff asked me how everything was. Totally clueless. Some workers realized they blew it. From the minute we arrived they acted like they didn't want us there. They cost themselves $120.00 or so, plus tip."}
{"text":"Have you ever had your server tell you that the kitchen forgot your order? Well, that's what happened to us at Sapori Grille yesterday -- our third (final?)of three botched dining experiences here.
Arrived around 12:20 for lunch, and there were 2 other tables. Placed our orders and were told again (this has happened each time here) that they were out of a certain item. This time, the stuffed peppers \"weren't ready yet.\"
Side salads were delivered quickly. Fresh, good dressing, nothing spectacular.
And the wait began...
About 15-20 minutes later, they had to open doors because the smoke was so strong from the kitchen... little did we know it was our lunches burning, because they didn't know either!
Another 15 minutes go by -- and this point we haven't seen our server since she took our order -- and we finally spot our server. \"Are we ever getting our food?\" my wife asks, just a bit of annoyance in her voice. Our server throws her hands up and says, \"I'm wondering where your food even is.\" OK.
Five minutes later... \"They forgot your food was in the even, so obviously it's burned to a crisp. He's gonna put new ones in right now.\"
By that time, we'd been in the restaurant more than 45 minutes, so we told her not to bother and left.... on to our next attempt to eat lunch.
As we were about to pull out of our parking spot, the owner runs out to our car and says, 'I'm so sorry. I'm the owner. This has never happened before. Next time you're in, just look for me, and I'll give you a meal for two.\" 
Not sure it there's going to be a next time."}
{"text":"It's cold outside, but warm and full of great food at Sapori 's.   It is my 41st birthday, and Italian food is my favorite.  I used to live on Murray Hill and have tried about every good Italian restaurant in the Cleveland area.  Sapori's Italian Grill is absolutely the best... By far. 

There is a great wine list, and cocktails too.  There is a small bar and you can watch the chef cook.  There are also chef's tables.  The bathrooms are not only spotless, but believe it or not, actually smell nice.  There is a seating area with aromatherapy items, and Italian soaps. 

In the past I have had the cavatelli, ribeye steak, chicken parmesan, white bean soup, minestrone, and warm mushroom salad. I can't even properly describe in words how excellent everything I have tried is. This is without a doubt the best Italian food I have ever had. I've traveled the country and had I have traveled everywhere and thank God the very best is right here in my backyard. 

Joe and Kelly own this restaurant. Joe is the best chef ever, and Kelly runs the bar and front of the restaurant. They are both very nice and make sure to come out and talk to the customers. They remembered me by name after my first visit! 

The staff are very pleasant and knowledgeable.  My drink was always filled in a timely manner, and they were more than happy to answer any questions. 

I really can't wait until summer, I am excited to have my dinner on the lovely patio. I just can't say enough about this place."}
{"text":"This place is seriously.... AMAZING!!! Please, please try this place out!! From the home made bread, wine selection, appetizers and entrees, it has been by far some of the best food I've tasted! You MUST get the lobster ravioli appetizer! It has a fried egg on top, but trust me... the flavor is unexpectedly incredible!"}
{"text":"We received a 50% off your entire bill coupon for moving to the neighborhood so we figured why not?

The place was dead and I don't know why?

The appetizers, food and wine were all excellent!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant never disappoints. Tonight we had the eggplant appetizer which was amazing. The specials included gnocchi and the chef allowed us to get a half order as we wanted to save room for dessert. Our bartender/server April was lovely!!  We ended the night with tiramisu and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"Utterly amazing food.   Service was great catering to my vegan wife.   I had the sea bass.  Wow!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for Italian food at decent prices it is a good place to be. If you are looking for high end fancy Italian then it's not. They have good veal and chicken parm. I would come here again."}
{"text":"Good food but dreadful service. Slow kitchen, no communication from servers, drinks run dry. If you go, make sure you have unlimited time, and maybe a deck of cards to pass the time during the interminable wait."}
{"text":"We decided to try the steak here as the place is billed as an Italian grill. My wife and I both had the bone in rib steak. It was like what you would find at a good steak house but at $19.00 not $28.00   We had a nice bottle of a red blend from California which the owner suggested and again a great wine at a value price. The place is small and cozy and the service was excellent. We will definitely come back here again. We didn't try any of the Italian dishes but what we saw and savored going by our table looked great"}
{"text":"This is a fabulous restaurant! The food was outstanding, the wait staff was friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was inviting! I highly recommend Sapori!!!"}
{"text":"I have probably driven past this place a hundred times in the past few years and never really knew it was there until I saw it on Yelp.  I'm very glad that I stopped!  This is now going to be my go-to restaurant for Italian food.  The service was phenomenal and everyone was incredibly inviting.  The prices are very reasonable. The lobster bisque was incredible as was the dinner and wine.  I will definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"We love Sapori, we've been in many times before. The food is excellent without that feel of a chain place since it's just a little local spot.  The service is always excellent. The management and owner really took the time to ensure everything we ordered was above board. We are anxious to go back on a Friday when they have a live band."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and first impression is that the service is understaffed. They knew they were struggling service-wise so when we inquired about our bottle of wine that we ordered, the waitress generously took $5 off the price of the bottle. They mean well but 2 servers for the place isn't enough. The food was excellent tho. I had the sea bass and a Caesar salad. Our wine was very good. But..... I wouldn't go back. Price point for a strip mall with poor service isn't too enticing."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets! The atmosphere is wonderful and the food is even better. They have a band play every Friday night and the band is great! Joe, the owner and chef is absolutely incredible. He is one of the nicest guys you will ever meet and he takes pride in his work. Once you enter the restaurant you are treated as family and friends, not just clients. You NEED to check this place out."}
{"text":"Okay the food was good... Was is worth waiting 1hour? Maybe not that good. 

Service was slow as molasses.
You will have to ask for everything, and yes they have bread but ask.
Yes they do refills, but might ask for it.
Yes you will get your salad, but it takes 25mins

Look you want good places to succeed, but training the wait staff a little more, and projecting thing to make long wait seem a little less would help."}
{"text":"Sapori Italian Grille is a great new addition to the culinary scene on Cleveland's west side.  The hand cut ribeye I had on my first visit was cooked to perfection and melt-in-your-mouth tender.  My mom had the Chiken Francese and raved about it.  The portions are very generous and the service knowledgeable and friendly....5 stars!"}
{"text":"Stopped in Monday for dinner...read raves about the pizza...tried to order, but \"we're out of crust\" was the reply after hearing about what a slow day it's been...prep?
Ordered Lobster Bisque...considering I like salty food...this was so over salted and broken to boot. Chef came by to see how things were, when told he replied \" it's the bottom of the batch and it concentrated being warmed all day\"...we'll that made me feel better.
Offered special, sea bass. They didn't give me a price, but based on other menu items, figured it'd be reasonable, especially being a special.  Fish was good, not great. Best part was asparagus, but I only got 3 little stalks and one burnt little carrot...but a pile of greasy fettuccine.  Coffee sucked too.  Bottom line, $40 bill for a not good dinner...  Way overpriced for the quality, or lack there of.
Was hoping for much better."}
{"text":"Sapori on friday night was just amazing, music room was swinging with live blues music. We started off with fried calamari and fried mozzarella which was yummy as hell. We all had different martinis and each one was really great. For dinner we had the Pesto crusted salmon, potatoe crusted walleye, Lobster ravioli and scallops. Everything was perfect and reminded me of my trip to the Amafi coast last summer. We we're pretty full but with our espresso we all shared the homemade brownie with sea salt. You will see us again very soon."}
{"text":"An informed, polite, well trained staff serving very good food and lending suggestions when asked. Great experience and not overly expensive for the quality of food and service. Best Alfredo I've had yet. Great place for a date night or special occasion!"}
{"text":"I just finished my lunch, and If I'm giving 2 stars it was because the food is good. Unfortunately, the server at the end of our experience, decided to answer a call while dropping the check and approached us with the phone on her ear. (No matter how important that call is, provide better service by refraining from taking a call in the dining room.) I may sound demanding, but I do run a similar business, and during service, a server should have their attention on the guest."}
{"text":"I love the food here but... the service kind of sucked. Literally saw my waitress once to take my order and then at the end for the bill. Went out for date night and didn't get my drink refilled the entire time. No one even asked how we were and I made it a point to put my empty cup on the very edge of the table. Not that it matters since my waitress never even came to check on us. Then when we were all done and ready for the bill she asks if we want more drinks lol. Anyways that's my rant. Good food, shitty service."}
{"text":"Why a 5 star?  I have celiac disease and the chef/owner accommodates for diet restrictions.  He has gluten free pasta, which is very good, and I trust him to keep it separate.  I have brought other friends and family with lactose intolerant,  vegetarian, vegan and meat lovers.  He cooks for everyone and the food is delicious.
My only observation is his staff can be so-so.  We have had outstanding service and mediocre.  Maybe a little more training would fix it but I'll keep coming back regardless."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian Restaurant in the area! Whether it's date night or a lunch date, we go to Sapori. I have a goal to try everything on the menu at least once. I'm half way to my goal and have never been disappointed and more than that, am usually more than pleased. 

If youtwist my arm to choose a favorite, the calamari and the tortelloni dinner (a special)would be my picks. My husband loves the rib eye steak and the giombotte pork chops - he always has a hard time choosing one over the other. Portions are generous and the staff are fantastically nice and attentive. The owner is kind and knowledgeable and a conversation with him about the entrees is a joy because you can sense his passion as a chef and his love for serving others.

Reservations are recommended, especially on Friday night's when live dinner music is playing. We've has the pleasure of dining a handful of times while a band was there and the bands chosen are truly phenomenally gifted. If going to enjoy the music only, you'll have to sit at the bar but the bartenders are a pleasure and the drinks delight."}
{"text":"I can't agree with the other reviewers.  I visited shortly after they opened and had a carry-out order of Chicken Marsala.  The chicken had no flavor and there wasn't a hint of the Marsala - it was a flavorless chicken breast in an indiscernible sauce.  .Also, something I found strange, the pasta that was used for a side dish came from a large pile of  spaghetti sitting on a baking sheet already cooked.  I will give them credit for their service which I thought was friendly and very good..  I haven't been back since but I'll probably give them another try. just in case I got them on an off night."}
{"text":"Food has been great, no misses in flavor or portions. Love the lobster ravioli. Pretty sure it's Ohio City Pasta. Service can be slow and confusing, interacting with multiple people for various things....bread, water, cocktails, etc. Overall a really nice spot for Good Itailian food."}
{"text":"My friend took me to Sapori Friday night to see live music and dinner. We didn't think about making reservations and the restraunt was all booked. But the staff, Kelly and our server Stacy made sure we had a table. The food was excellent! Stacy was the best! After we ate, we went into the bar area and were seated at a booth so we could enjoy the band. We ended up making many new friends here. We had an excellent time! Thank you!! we even met the owner and Chef Joe! Will see you all very soon!!

{"text":"If you enjoy Italian food you need to find this place.  They have the best meatballs I've ever had at a restaurant, awesome sauce, Alfredo was fantastic...  We put together a menu for a group of 13, veal, chicken parm, pork, pastas, you name it.  The portions far exceeded our expectations.  I can't praise this guy enough.  If you know Italian and enjoy it you better find your way here."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal!  Met with friendly service, perfect cocktail to start.  Lobster bisque lived up to the hype from the server.  They made small plates to order for my children.  I don't venture too far on Italian, but the veal parm was thin, crispy but tender inside, and yummy.  Sauce well seasoned but not too spicy.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad, but the service was lousy. It took them over an hour to serve the 2 of us and the place wasn't even busy. In fact, we sat by the door and only one couple entered during our over-an-hour wait."}
{"text":"Awesome place if you are in the mood for Italian food and some quiet time. Chef personally came to our table to recommend wine, both appetizers and entrees were fabulous."}
