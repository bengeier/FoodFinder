{"text":"Decent quality sushi, but we're in it for the beef cup, a cup full of steamed rice, veggies and most importantly braised teryaki beef. It's good and in a huge enough portion to split two way. Perfect for a cheep take out or on the run lunch, although during lunch hour, sushi lovers can get surprisingly busy, I mean it's so crowded, you can barely fit in. So without the crowd it's zippy but with, it's nauseatingly slow. Still pretty awesome though.  Sushi Lovers top 3: 1) beef cup 2) glass noodle 3) surprisingly awesome ramen"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place one night looking for a quick snack. This place seems like it is owned by a couple and its a small location with no seating. The sushi selection is not massive but they have the essentials (bento boxes etc) and they make sushi to order, not stacked up in a fridge. I had the scary dragon sushi and it was a nice spicy sushi at a good price."}
{"text":"As a student at Forest Hill this is my go to place for lunch every week. At 8.95 a BEEF CUP (the caps lock is necessary) and a drink. The Asian couple running the place were charming and used to dealing with students like me. They give everyone free glass noodles which are awesome and the food is quick but natural and delicious it's so great and the food is in huge portions so perfect for couples. Overall I give this place 4.8 out of 5 so I would round it to a 5/5 or 10/10"}
{"text":"We ordered four rolls - yam, avocado, salmon, and spicy tuna plus japchae. Unfortunately, the best thing was the japchae. The owner was super nice, so at least it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"This little gem is located just off Spadina in the Forrest Hill village. Owned by an adorable couple. Everything is made fresh and to order. You can tell that all the ingredients are fresh and dishes are made using authentic recipes. No seating during the winter but they set up a cute patio in the summer. Really good for a a quick take-out dinner!"}
{"text":"Walked in to order sushi and the female working was talking on her phone and would  not even get off it to help us. I had questions but she was to concentrated on her phone call to answer my questions. I ordered my meal and took it out. When I got home I ate my sushi and it was super bland! I am so upset and do not plan to ever go back to pay for bland sushi and rudeness."}
