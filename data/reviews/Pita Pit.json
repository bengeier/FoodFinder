{"text":"Pita Pit is a more interesting version of Subway, to me. You can pick from a variety of meats, cheeses, veggies, and sauces. Its inexpensive and tasty.  The staff was friendly and made the experience even better."}
{"text":"This is a great, nay the best, place to grab pitas in downtown with more than fresh ingredients - including spinach :) They recently moved 2 blocks away to 1508 4th Street SW. This is just a block north of 17th ave sw on 4th St.  Follow @pitapiton4th on twitter to get in on their deal list too  :D (Just like @Charcut's alley burgers.)  JS"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to try this place based on all the good reviews with a few not so good ones. The staff greeted me and were friendly, I ordered the chicken pita and the pita bread and chicken were great. Unfortunately, the taste was ruined from the chemical taste that was either coming from the romaine or the cucumbers. The tzatzik, if that's what you would like to call it tasted more like a low fat sour cream with an after taste. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is great and has surprisingly great cookies, too. Big portions and good flavor."}
{"text":"enjoy the service and the food, however have to agree with  \"Susan J.\" the place is always cold, very uncomfortable to eat there."}
{"text":"I was sincerely hoping for something super tasty at this spot near my new home, but was a bit disappointed.  I would say it's somewhere between 2 and 3 stars.  Yes, the veggies are fresh and there are lots of them-spinach, red and green peppers, jalapenos, cukes.  However the olives are canned.  I had the chicken souvlaki with veggies and let's just say, it's not Chipotle.  And there was very little chicken-I felt like I was on an expedition.  The place was clean and at about 6PM there were only a couple of people in there.  Also, the folks who wait on you are just as friendly as you would hope.  I just wouldn't go out of my way to get a pita here which is more like a smallish burrito.  And yes, it's inexpensive, however for almost the same $ you get more and tastier at someplace like Chipotle.  However I might go back and try something else."}
{"text":"The staff are always friendly.  The atmosphere is relaxed.  The food is AMAZING.  Large portions and great taste.  My personal favorite is \"THE LOCAL\".  It combines 3 great tastes in one Pita.  My service animals even love it.  I get then the \"lil\" turkey.     you can fax in an order or order on line.  they even do school lunch program and corporate catering.    I love that the staff all seem to love what they do and you know the food is good when staff eat there as well.  Recommendations from the staff have proven to be good tasting as well.    They even have great soup and chili.  The tomato soup with a Queso-pita is a nice rainy day treat.  The chili has great flavor with just enough bite.  Guess I know what I'm having for lunch again...writing this review is making me hungry."}
{"text":"This was my first going here.  Horrible!  The ice machine was broken had I been informed I would have gotten a bottled drink. But no. My friend had an issue with the manager because she couldn't figure out how to credit back her account.  The manager had a huge attitude and acted like we the issue. The staff went back to let people in the back know and they were so obvious when staring at us. I go to eat my sandwich and the lettuce was all old and the nasty white part and the bacon was still raw. My soda was hot and flat. Do not go here."}
{"text":"Excellent food excellent service excellent prices! I would eat the chicken Caesar pita every day if I could!"}
{"text":"I have tried this place twice and have not been impressed. The first time, I ordered a standard gyro, the pita bread had mold on it. The second time, I ordered pita bread with hummus dip, for whatever reason, they toasted the pita bread and it was like eating cardboard, just not pleasant to eat. The hummus was ok, but I will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Wow! I am impressed! This place has newly opened up on Maryland Pkwy, across from UNLV. 5 stars because this is the BEST place to get a PITA sandwich in Vegas. Well, I don't really know of any other places, but whatever... They are good at what they do. Their outside, window menu has tons of dietary details for each of their items. Their motto is \"Fresh Thinking, Healthy Eating.\"  You order what kind of meat combination you want in your pita (vegetarian options available). Then while they heat that up on a flat top, you tell them everything that you want inside your pita. It's set up pretty much like a subway. For example, I got lettuce, spinach, avocado, mushrooms, cucumbers, banana peppers, feta cheese and I choose the caesar chicken which also included bacon and caesar dressing. Once everything is in your pita pocket, they roll it up so that you can get a bite of everything all at once. It basically looked like a burrito.  I got a combo which included my pita sandwich, chips & a drink. The girl asked if I go to UNLV and she gave me a rebel discount. She did not even ask for my Rebelcard ID. It came out to $8.46.  My pita sandwich was SOOOOO GOOD!!!! I think the part that shocked me the most was how juicy my chicken was. Usually, grilled chicken has a bad habit of being dry, but not here.  Only complaint was that I couldn't even tell I had any bacon in there. In fact, I forgot until I got to a bite which was pretty much all bacon.  The staff was very friendly and the inside of the restaurant was very clean. I look forward to going back and trying more combinations of pita sandwiches! I think this place will be very successful, especially for those who are health conscious. Vegetarians will love this new option."}
{"text":"The idea of Pita Pit is great. Healthy, tasty options very conveniently located on the corner of state street. The food is great but the service is next to awful. The workers seem confused and very spacey, and it's not just one or two specific workers, it's all of them. I don't know why it would take close to 15 minutes to get two people through the line with only two other people in front of them. Good food but poor service!"}
{"text":"Best of the best when you are trying to eat healthy, yet want delivery food if you don't feel like going out or can't get away from work. Always on time, always fresh, and the delivery people are polite, clearly spoken , and friendly. It's a great break from pizza and wings."}
{"text":"I have always loved Pita pit!! I first went to the one in Flagstaff and I was so happy when a new store opened up closer to me. The staff here are so friendly and helpful. I love this place and I love all the combinations you can have!!"}
{"text":"Love pita pit for a fresh and quick lunch. Staff is generally nice and I love the options provided to eat healthy"}
{"text":"Way overrated. This is basically like subway wrapped in pita bread. Won't go again."}
{"text":"Used them quite a few time for delivery. Great selection of sandwiches and pretty decent smoothies. The price is also fairly decent for what you get. The biggest perk of this place to me is delivery service as its typically our first choice when ordering out. I would recommend them."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating here. The fresh choices are nice, but much too often, they are out of stock...out of cucumbers, prime rib, etc.   I like having my food as a salad, as a diabetic, I watch my carb intake."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have a ton of healthy options and delicious grilled meats. Tons of veggie options, and if you don't like pitas, you can always get your pita turned into a salad! Don't forget the avocado!  I would give the place 5 stars, but the staff often leaves you waiting for several minutes before they serve you. The line is usually empty, as is the restaurant. A certain employee seems to usually have his head up his you know what, and makes it seem as if you are being an inconvenience to him. Other than that this is a good place to eat. A good alternative to Subway."}
{"text":"The Dagwood is one of the Best sandwiches I've ever had!  No joke, this is a great sandwich.  Was passing through Fairlawn, on my way to visit family, and stopped in for a quick bite.  Service was friendly and very helpful.  Since we had never been here before we weren't sure how the menu worked.  The manager actually took the time to walk us through the menu and make suggestions.  My wife was impressed with the chicken Caesar and kids were happy with their meals too.  Will definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"Good fast food that is always fresh. The team is friendly and keeps the restaurant clean and well stocked.  The Pininfarina soda machine is good times.   Given the fresh ingredients, and made to order format, the onus is on you if you don't enjoy your pita. We always do."}
{"text":"Great take out for a large group!  Sandwiches are sliced and packed in a handy box. Very tasty."}
{"text":"5 stars for kind service and 5 stars for food! Prior to this day I had never been to Pita Pit, so when I entered I was pleasantly surprised that there was a vegan black bean patty. The feng shui of the place isn't the best (the line of four people had looped around this random pillar), but as soon as I got to the front and the cashier asked if I wanted my vegan patty microwaved instead of on the grill with meat, feng shui was the last thing on my mind. They have so many vegetable options, too. (I'm the type of person to get as much as possible, and just trust that it will taste fine). I stuffed mine with spinach, pineapple, mushroom, bell pepper, and avocado. Absolutely delicious! Will come back if I'm ever on this side of town again."}
{"text":"I am giving Pita Pit on Tryon 5 stars! Our office orders from here frequently and the staff is always polite and timely! Even a few minutes behind they provide some extra goodies! Thanks for the great experiences!"}
{"text":"Fresh and variety of menu options. Even have soup, but a little more expensive than the average fast food meal. 2 adults & 2 toddlers cost us $30. Small pitas are just under $6, large are just under $8. To add chips/drink is additional $2.50. They do have a Coca-cola machine that give tons of drink options tho which is nice. Clean. Only a few tables inside, tons of seating outside.  Buffalo pita tasted like spicy bbq not usual buffalo sauce..."}
{"text":"The space was clean. Atmosphere bright. The quality of food for the money was poor.  The amount of meat on the club was minimal while the hash browns on the morning glory were not heated thoroughly."}
{"text":"The male is working right now- too busy texting to take my order. No one else in the store- we both were standing face to face by the register while I was waiting for him to finish his text to take my order. Pita Pit is my favorite and my husband and I come in a few time a week since it opened. I don't know if I will come back with that service."}
{"text":"Good food however when it gets crowded perhaps hiring 1 or 2 more employees for quicker service might help with clients NOT Walking out .  Friendly employees tho ."}
{"text":"This place is just OKAY!  The pitas tastes good, but my friend and I wanted to order in, and it was a long, confusing process!!  I'd rate them higher if it wasn't for the fact that ordering online was a huge issue.  Originally, my friend and I called the restaurant to place an order, and they answered and said that we had to do it online so we hung up went to the website and tried to find where to place an order but could not find it on the website. Turns out they had multiple different website so it was hard to know which one to place an order on. Finally my friend and I found the one where you could place an order and when we tried to place an order, we kept getting bounced back.  We tried to place an order for probably at least 20 minutes! Out of frustration we called the restaurant and spoke with someone and they ended up having to just take our order over the phone. So basically we wasted 20 minutes when we could've placed it over the phone in the first place! After we ordered the food it didn't take them too long to deliver it, probably about 20 minutes. The food was pretty good and the pitas were pretty good-sized! I say your best bet is to just go into the restaurant instead of trying to order on their website."}
{"text":"YUSSSSS FALAFEL AND PITA!!!!! Could life get any better?! I think not. The Pita Pit is the best place to go when you're drunk and need to shove food in your face, which is the exact reason why I made my first visit. I may not totally remember a lot of that night, but what I do remember is the Pita Pit. The place is great! The staff is nice, there is a lot to choose from, the food is cheap and you get a lot of it for your money's worth (I'm pretty sure my pita was the size of a small sedan). Overall, I can't wait to go back and I will definitely make it a place I stop by when I am in Madison."}
{"text":"Excellent and fast friendly service. Philly steak with mushrooms on the grill is the best. Absolutely recommend everyone eats here."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Pita Pit for years. I am a one trick pony when it comes to my sandwich. Every single time I place an order (via Door dash or Grubhub) it's wrong. Every time!  So I started calling to ensure the order with the instructions was coming through correctly. Each time they read it back, it's accurate. Each time I receive my sandwich, it's wrong.  I'm done!  When I called and spoke to Chantel (the manager), she read exactly how I want my sandwich. When I received it, everything that I did not order was on there!! This really use to be a decent sandwich spot, but over the years service and quality has deteriorated."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch if you are downtown. I ordered a hummus vegetarian pita wrap and it was stuffed with fresh veggies and a decadent hummus. I could hardly finish it but did anyway! The service could be a little quicker for lunchtime but it wasn't that bad. I still was able to walk to the Pita Pit, order my food and then walk back in a half hour."}
{"text":"I come here often and love this location. The staff are very friendly and quick, and the pitas are always well made with quality ingredients. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"The Dirty Badger (the local) is amazing! Great food and tons of options. You can also get any pita as a salad."}
{"text":"Best Pita spot on this side of town! Definitely  going back . Customer service is great , and they deliver :)"}
{"text":"Quality of pita bread is fresh and yummy. Great quality healthy food. Fast and fresh every time."}
{"text":"Great pitas and lots of variety of toppings/fillings- veggies, cheeses, sauces, dressings, etc.  It's designed more as a take-out place, so if you plan to eat there, there are always plenty of tables, but be prepared that it gets pretty noisy."}
{"text":"Love the Pita Pit! Everything is fresh, Delicious & healthy! Very clean & friendly & helpful staff...I can't stop coming here ;) !"}
{"text":"Yelp doesn't mention the correct closing time. It closes 10 pm Monday to Thursday. Yelp should confirm the time with the store."}
{"text":"Fell into this little subway style eatery by happenstance and I must say the food was fresh, reasonable priced with a clean environment. Our sandwiches were quite good minus missing  cheese w/small portions. The lackluster rating is due to the ordeal it became to get the orders placed and still be incorrect.  Two staff were on hand, one who asked what we wanted, but nothing is written down so the assumption here is they remember the order and communicate it to the next employee who makes the sandwiches, nay, nay.. That was not the way these two super workers rolled. We were asked politely multiple times, what type of pita, exacting fixings to the point of having me come over and point and monitor how the they made a tuna pita with lettuce, tomato, and shredded cheese! The breakfast pita although ordered with cheese, came delivered sans the cheese. The young man making my order had to be brand spanking new, he also mumbled which made it hard to understand! The two of them just seemed confused. More training ? I realize this review may sound petty ,but I don't think the customers should have to work so hard to get a pita sandwich! I loved the food, but have no desire to revisit, too painful!"}
{"text":"Oh no... brown lettuce??? Please change this as it makes me wonder are the rest of the ingredients fresh?? Cannot believe this....:("}
{"text":"I just got back to my office from picking up a chicken pita. The chicken on the pita is brown and greasy with a ton of fat on it. I spent $11.00 on a pita, chips and drink and do not expect to get this quality with such a high price meal."}

{"text":"I would like you to know how upset I am with the franchise located at the Nor-terra shops, 2510 W Happy Valley, Phoenix az 85027. Last Night i took my family to the Movies at Nor-terra, after the movie we sat outside the store and we were going to go into your store to grab a bite to eat but we were waiting for someone. One of my sons (3years old) had to go to the restroom so I had my other son (16) take him into pita pit to go. I watched him take him in then when he was coming back out the guy in the store started harassing them for using the bathroom and not buying anything, as my son was trying to explain he started cursing my sons out so loud that I heard him from outside. I ran into the store and got in his face asking him what he thought he was doing cursing at my sons, he proceeded to curse me out and tell me to get out of his store or he would call security, I told him to do so and i would tell security how he treated his customers and I would contact his manager, he said he is the manager and nobody is going to tell him how to treat his customers and told me to get the F out of his store. I am a business owner myself and I can even fathom why someone would treat their customers in this manner. I will never eat at any pita pit again, nor will I ever recommend it to any of my friends. I am also going to go onto yelp, google, yellow pages and every other rating site to tell my experience with this Pita Pit. GO TO PITA JUNGLE 4 DOORS DOWN, THEY KNOW HOW TO TREAT A CUSTOMER!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We happened to visit this place because we planned to be in the area and we had a Groupon deal.  The deal stated that for $7 you got  $14 worth of pita sandwiches, salads, and drinks.  This place is farther down highway 7 from 404 then I thought, and you can easily miss it.   Our first mistake was that we thought this place was extreme pita not pita pit. The decor here is definitely low-budget and unpolished compared to the recently remodeled McDonald's next door or any of the Extreme Pita locations I have visited.  the food was not as great as Extreme Pita. but not terrible either.  What really irritated me, and thus the low star rating, was that the gentlemen behind the counter made it very difficult to honor the Groupon. My partner first wanted to get a salad, and he tried to claim that a salad was not part of the plan and that he had to call someone (either Groupon or the boss) to verify. The deal clearly stated salads as part of the deal. Then I tried to order the chicken souvlaki special. Once  again,. the store employee claimed that I was only allowed to order full priced items. Once again this was not explicitly noted as an exception. Had I been aware of these rules and the challenges in redeeming the Groupon, I would not have bought one.  So bottom line is that I would not have driven out of my way if I had known that this Pita Pit provided average food and draconian rules around accepting deal vouchers to bait and switch prospective customers. Either Groupon or this store need to get their act together. If you are going to offer a deal then you need to stick to it or your reputation is null.    I"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Chris, who was on duty, was extremely helpful since it was our first time here. We enjoyed the Caesar chicken pita and the gyros pita. And a strawberry smoothie, all very tasty! We would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Service is always fast and friendly.  Food is fresh and of good quality for the price."}
{"text":"The food here is usually pretty good, and all of there pitas are around $7.50 but the service is awful.  The last three times we went we showed up between 8:00 to 8:30 (they close at 9:00) and the staff was rude.  They already started putting there food away and refused to bring back out the food they had already put away.  Overall the foods good but we try to avoid going here because the staff act as if you are inconveniencing them every time we go in."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch and was surprised by how poorly this place performs. To start, the cashier rang up our order incorrectly, then made it seem like he was doing us a favor by not charging us correctly. Staff making the sandwiches had no clue what to do or how to treat a customer. The woman making my tuna pita started talking about how tuna makes her puke...appetizing. She then tried to put chicken on my wife's veggie pita. Took about 10 minutes to get our two sandwiches correct. If they ever get busy, it will be a disaster. They were also out of iced tea. They should have ironed out the kinks before opening. Training your employees on first time customers is a great way to not get repeat customers."}
{"text":"Awesome food-- A huge variety of options and they use a really nice, soft, pita bread.   Personal favorite: Chicken Caesar !  You're not there for the ambiance, but the place is clean with some background tunes and decent enough seating! Dine-in or take-out, you wont regret it! (unless you throw in ingredients in your pita that really don't complement each other...then it is your fault!)"}
{"text":"I'm really impressed with the rockstar service I received here. I was immediately greeted with a smile and asked if I had been to a Pita Pit before. Obviously living in Cleveland it has been quite some time (my last visit was in my college days) so it was good to get a solid refresher on how it worked.   I was impressed with how quick everything was made. One employee started my pita by adding all of the toppings I wanted while the meat was grilled. Super efficient system and there was obvious team work and great communication.   It is so nice to have an option where you can get a quick, healthy lunch that isn't Subway (which isn't really healthy anyways). Thanks for bringing Pita Pit to Westgate Mall (and to the Cleveland area in general!). I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I would go to this place everyday for lunch. But one of the guys that works there is super disrespectful to customers. He is super curt and kind of shouts at the customers. He has a super strong lisp and is oddly aggressive. I had to stop going there simply because the service was so bad. Based on his behavior, he should be fired in my opinion."}
{"text":"Basically an exotic subway.  Pitas are extremely thin, but the real horror was the meat storage.  The meat is stored in a giant refrigerated door pre made and clearly frozen.  The toppings are left for what looks like days in a room temperature station.  The place is okay for a quick bite if you don't care too much about taste but like I wrote earlier it is an exotic subway.  The workers were nice."}
{"text":"This location is super busy (right across from U of T) and understaffed, but if you know Pita Pit, all that doesn't matter because of their Pitas.   I had to wait a little while for my food, but the woman behind the counter was doing the best she could to help every one and was very nice. I always go here when I feel like a cheap, healthy, quick, and cheap lunch that reminds me of undergrad."}

{"text":"This place is amazing.  Their food is sooo fresh, seriously, the freshest spinach ever. Not to mention their feta too, it is the best!  I often go in and order a chicken pita with spinach,  feta, cucumber and tzatziki. Simple and delicious, especially after a good workout or run.  Yum, this place makes me hungry thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Pita Pit used to be my goto place. I like to stop here on my way home from work on weekends. The last few times I have gone have not been pleasing. Lately they have been playing music not appropriate for guests. I walked by on a Friday and saw employees playing beer pong on the tables. It is unacceptable behaviour for a restaurant like this. Sadly I will not be returing with such terrible management."}
{"text":"Always great service! Orders always exact! Staff is awesome! Ingredients always fresh! Obviously- no complaints! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and have always enjoyed my food, but tonight I feel I received exceptional service. I stopped into to the restaurant with my mother and boyfriend to grab a quick bite before a movie. My mother had never been before, so she had many questions about the menu and ordering. The young man a the register was very kind and patient with us and introduced us to the rewards program while we were taking our time figuring out what to eat. After we sat down he came over to our table to check on us (specifically my mother) to make sure we were enjoying our meal. It was unexpected for a \"grab and go\" place like that to have someone check in on you after you get your food. All the staff was really especially nice and patient with us and we really enjoyed our experience!"}

I would recommend this location to everyone and couldn't be more pleased to work just across the street!"}

{"text":"This place was amazing, food was great I had the gyro.  Leah (manager ) was very helpful and and kind.... very refreshing."}
{"text":"Absolutely love pita pit! The variety is better than Subway and any meat/veggies is grilled right in front of you. There is also a great selection of toppings and sauces. Once wrapped up, the pita is nice and warm and if you have the pleasure to eat it right away, tastes great!   I look forward to coming back when I'm looking for good food in a hurry."}
{"text":"Cannot reccomend to anyone. As a former employee, I can confirm that all the food comes processed, pre portioned, and frozen. It was so disgusting I refused to even eat there for my own meals. The back kitchen is dirty and unorganized, and the dining area is not regularly cleaned.  Most of the employees are not friendly and inviting towards customers, and I myself faced discrimination from upper management.  Do not eat here."}
{"text":"I live nearby and try to eat healthy (no carbs).  Decided today was a Pita Pit day and I am so happy that I chose them.  Ordered the Gyro - fork style (salad) with double meat.  This is not my normal order so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I got the mix of iceberg/romaine/spinach, tomatoes, cheese and caesar dressing, tzatzike sauce on the side.  Exactly like a salad I get at a greek restaurant here in town (instead of it being a chicken caesar, it is a gyro caesar.  For about 1/2 the price at the greek restaurant this was very comparable and very delicious.  I have yet to have a bad meal there and like every other time I have been there, the person and/or people behind the counter are always friendly, courteous and customer service orientated.  The owner is always behind the counter or comes out from the back and says \"hi\" to whomever is in the building.  Love this place!!  :)"}

{"text":"Placed an order online for delivery, received a confirmation via email that it would be delivered at 1:14pm. At 1:11pm I realized I had requested a fountain drink, but had not specified what drink so I called the store. The young man I spoke with told me they had not received my order at all, and questioned me repeatedly was I sure I placed the order for the right location. I am not stupid. Yes, the order was for the right location. He finally sighed and said \"well just give me your order then I guess\". So I told him the order. He said they would make it and bring it over. Ok, great. 20 MINUTES LATER my phone rings. It's the kid from Pita Pit, AGAIN asking was I sure I placed the order for the right store. He then says \"we still have not received your order, so we'll just have to do it over the phone.\" I said ?????????????????????? Did we not just do that when I called you TWENTY MINUTES AGO? Now at this point it's been over an hour since I placed the order, so I'm done. I tell the kid cancel my order, refund my money, I'm going somewhere else. He tells me to go online and cancel it.  I go online to cancel the order and - SHOCKER - can't do it, since the order was already placed. I check my bank account and sure enough, the $18 (yes, $18 for one sandwich and a side of hummus) has already been taken out by Pita Pit. So. I call back. Ask to speak with a manager. Who ALSO asks me if I was sure I placed the order for the right store. She then tells me she will have to call the third party company they use to manage online orders, because she can not issue the refund. Cross your fingers this actually happens. Neither of the people I spoke with today seems to have any competence beyond throwing ingredients into a pita.  Before today's experience, I had only eaten at Pita Pit one other time and was less than impressed with the food. I thought I would give it one more chance, but after this I will never eat there again. DO NOT recommend."}
{"text":"I have visited Pita Pit many many times and it is always my favorite!! I have been for lunch, dinner and midnight snacks! My favorite pita is the chicken pita!! They are usually quick, the food is hot. I love all of the options. Wish they would bring the swiss cheese back but other than that I love Pita Pit :)."}
{"text":"I went to Pita Pit after a night out at the bars and I was very impressed. Bert (the guy behind the counter) made me a Philly Cheese Steak pita and it was incredible. He put southwestern sauce and jalapeno peppers on it. It was my first time at a Pita Pit and I am slightly upset there is not one on Long Island.  Next time I visit WVU I will have to pay Bert a visit."}

Quick and attentive staff, and owners you can tell take a lot of pride in their store. If you're looking for a great meal at a very reasonable price, this is it!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time this past Saturday and was far from happy. A coworker and I had pitas and smoothies delivered at work. Delivery was early but the driver stood there waiting for a tip when we already had added one by card online. Also, the options on their site are false advertisement. I added \"sauteed onions, sauteed peppers, and sauteed mushrooms\" to my pita, and after I got my food they were raw, and there was hardly any meat on it!! The pita and smoothie were both bland, and the smoothie started separating after sitting for less than 10 minutes. The food is pretty expensive for the quality, it was $30.00 after delivery for only two people and that was for a mid sized pita and smoothie only, no sides. My coworker was also so unhappy he ate two bites and threw the rest of his pita away. We won't be ordering from there again. Save your money!"}
{"text":"Staff was not friendly and that lack a lot of the items of the other pita pits in the area. If you want a good pita and better options than skip this location.  There are others near by that will make you much happier."}
{"text":"Good pita joint. I had the southwest chipotle steak and it was ok. The meat was delicious and hot but the bread and toppings were cold so I didn't enjoy the mix. Service was friendly but not genuine. You don't expect more though. A bit overpriced for the value. Overall not bad, it won't be my first choice but I could go back sometime for a change."}
{"text":"Love their Plant Strong options.  They have online ordering so I can just walk in and pick it up.  Love their Hummus Pita."}
{"text":"I found the food great and the staff was awesome and attentive. I just dropped in with 10 other friends at the heart of lunch rush and they did not bat an eye. But foremost the food (Philly Cheese Pita) was incredible!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out today because it was across the street from the hospital where my kid was at. The food and service is great.  I ordered 3 different things because they all sounded good and they all were great.  I will be back this place was great!"}
{"text":"I apologize.   I typed my review on the wrong restaurant site.   Disregard this rating.   I'm sure it's good but I've never been there."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place. Good service and nice healthy food. They have a nice variety of meats to choose from with the a list of how may calories listed next to them. I go there at least once a week trying something new each time. I'm definitely a fan of the chicken soulvaki (not sure on spelling) and the turkey. Definitely better than Subway!"}
{"text":"So happy to finally have a Pita Pit in the area. I used to go when I was in college, it's the perfect addition to downtown Cornelius! Awesome food and incredibly friendly staff(: highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Quick and easy. Pros are the many custom pita choices, fast service, and friendly staff. Cons are what you expect with fast food, the pitas aren't even fresh (look like an average bag from your local food mart) and the meat is over seasoned yet somehow underwhelming in flavor, especially the traditional gyro meat. Stick to stuffing a pita and avoid other menu options for the best value."}
{"text":"First time = 5 stars, I will surely be back and update the review accordingly - but based on my first experience:   Firstly, shoutout to Postmates - which allowed me to have Pita Pit delivered, which was definitely a perk. -- (NOTE: THIS REVIEW DOES INCLUDE A DINING IN EXPERIENCE)   My wife and I ordered two pitas, one had steak and the other had chicken. Both were absolutely loaded with what you could tell is high-quality, fresh ingredients. I ordered the chicken caesar and highly customized it (which is another huge perk of the Pita pit, the customization options). I loaded mine with veggies and it came with an equal amount, fully packed with these fresh ingredients -- I was stoked.   Super flavor and honestly fresh tasting ingredients will cause me to come back again."}
{"text":"We were in a hurry to grab something to eat on a Friday night and thought we'd give Pita Pit a try. Big mistake. Two people working, and not very quick, clean or efficient! We definitely won't be going back here. There weren't many people in line, and one of the people ahead of us gave up and left before ordering.  Chicken was frozen, had more fat than taste.  We weren't asked if we wanted sauce on our sandwiches. There are many better places to eat than this poorly run shop!"}
{"text":"Good food but my pita was so much smaller then that girls I was with.  That shit doesn't go unnoticed. sorry for not having boobs."}
{"text":"First time here, excellent! I had the Chicken Souvlaki and my son had the Lil' Chicken. Both excellent (I had some of his). Friendly service and reasonable prices, I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"OK we like gyros, what we got was cold, small little burritos. No sauce when we ordered sauce, no cheese, we ordered cheese. 30 minutes late. No flavor on the meat, the pita was cold and soggy. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"So yummy! Can get a little pricey, but so worth it! If you're not starving, I'd recommend sharing with someone. I always get the grilled chicken caesar pita on wheat, no bacon. I crave it all the time!"}
{"text":"Guess Ashley had gone on a bad day just finish a chicken caesar amazing and the staff was so friendly would go back again"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed with this location tonight. I have had great customer service there before, but tonight not so much. Placed an order through the mobile app for delivery while at work. About 5 minutes after, a female employee called and said there was no delivery tonight. I then asked for a refund then, because I'm at work, and nope couldn't do that either. No manager on site for that. So, what to do? Had to beg a co worker to cover for me so I could walk there or I would have been out of $15. On top on that paid a delivery fee and the female employee was rude. I wasnt even hungry after all of that."}
{"text":"Basically a Subway with a pita. Ill take subway,  more meat and cheaper.  4 tiny slices of gyro mystery meat. Meat was flavorless and mushy.  And paul the owner is commenting saying its premium meat...  yeah right.  How do you get perfectly rectangular gyro meat?  Looked like the slices you buy at a grocery store.  They say they grill it,  no sear, no flavor.  Won't be back ever.  Paul the owner thinks his pitas are the greatest thing ever.  I made a better sandwich for lunch,  and didn't cost me 8 dollars."}
{"text":"Drove all the way from northwest Las Vegas and place is closed, come on its wed at noon!! What kind of business do you run?? Sign says \"Closed for Thanksgiving\" really??! What doesn't that mean are you closed all week?? It's the day before thanksgiving everywhere is busy and you are closed!! Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Chicken was frozen, one of the workers was wearing slippers, they had nothing prepped and it was completely dead. I would love to see their health inspection. First and last time going there."}
{"text":"The first time I walked into this pita pit I noticed how fresh all the ingredients were! I had never been to a pita pit before, the staff was so helpful and friendly in helping me figure out what I would enjoy, which made my experience even better. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for an amazing pita!!"}
{"text":"The owner sleeps with married men to get business. Her name is Melanie, she is your typical Scottsdale chick, fake hair, fake boobs, and bitchy attitude. Women, keep your men away from her"}
{"text":"I was told Pita Pit was similar to a mix of Chipotle and Subway and I have to say I agree.    Being my first time here, the girl at the register was happy to help with any questions.  I ordered a gyro, which included beef and lamb.  The meat was thrown on the grill and while it cooked, I chose what ingredients I wanted in my pita.  I was very happy to hear that every ingredient in front of me was FREE to add,  including four different cheeses and avocado!! With all the free toppings, my pita did start to fall apart. Altogether, the pita was a good portion and tasted excellent.    Since I was on Mill Avenue, I wanted to sit outside. The outside seating was very small, wobbly, and a little dirty.    In conclusion, I would choose Chipotle before Pita Pit, and Pita Pit before Subway."}
{"text":"If I could rate Pita Pit in the minus category, I would. The food seems to be OK based on a previous visit. However, the attitude of the staff is just plain horrible!! My wife and I were attending the Tempe  Arts Festival last Saturday, and decided to stop by Pita Pit for a sandwich. We needed to use the rest rooms for obvious reasons. I walked into the restaurant while my wife waited outside, and since the bathrooms are locked, I asked one of the counter people to unlock the men's room facilities, assuring her that I was indeed going to order food. I used the bathroom, attempted to wash my hands with only cold water available, and then my wife walked in, asked for the bathroom to be unlocked, and the same counter person insisted that she order food first, and then she would be \"allowed\" to use the facilities.  At that point, we just left, and ate lunch somewhere else. By the way, earlier I had asked for a menu, and another counter person handed me the catering menu, rather than bother to look for the regular menu."}
{"text":"Food is okay, nothing special, around $7 for a pita is too expensive when they give you little to no meat at all. They give you very little at the veggie bar too.   I picked chicken with spinach, cucumber and a Tzatziki sauce. The girl gave me a small little handful of spinach and a tablespoon of diced cucumber, doesn't even fill up half of the pita. I left still feeling hungry.   A similar place that serve pita as well, cost me $8, comes with a skewer of grilled chicken breast, side salad and pita with Txatziki sauce. With an additional $2.50 for a combo, it comes with fried or rice and a drink. Food was super yummy at this other place.   Pita pit cost $9+ for a meal that comes with a pita and a drink. The food is so so and not good quality."}
{"text":"This is a great location fresh wraps and excellent customer service. The barbershop close by recommended them to our family so we gave them A try. A little bit slow in service but otherwise fantastic."}
{"text":"I ordered a gyro and it was very good! It tasted really fresh and I would go back again. The staff was nice and helpful as well.   If you've never been it's subway stiled for pitas.   I got cucumber sauce, fetta cheese, onion, peppers, and cucumbers. I ordered a regular pita that ran about $7"}
{"text":"Huge pitas, huge salads and everything is FRESH.  I love it!!  I just wish they could toast the pita shells for u,  that would make it even better! One of the best fast-food places to eat  in downtown Pgh."}
{"text":"Smelled good, looked good, lost appetite when the young lady that was making my Philly answered the phone with her gloves on, took peoples credit cards, used cash register, scratched her face all with the same pair of gloves and then thought it was ok to handle the food."}
{"text":"Big fan. Nice choice to bring into Jays games, or for lunch. They're welcoming towards my dog, too, so it saves me a trip home whenever I want to go. Toppings are fresh, meat is flavourful and the pita rarely rips (and if it does it's because I've asked them to stuff it a bit too much...a guy's gotta eat). New points program for the occasional free pita is great as well. Stop in next time you're in a hurry for a quick and tasty lunch."}
{"text":"It's set up a lot like Subway. Order he in one spot, add your veggies in another.  I ordered the steak and eggs pita. It was $6 and some change and boy was this thing enormous! I surely ate the whole thing too as I was starving. The guy at the register was very friendly and the staff was nice as a whole. They're very efficient with making your pita and they always make sure they tell you that you'll be finished up at the veggie/toppings area. The ingredients all taste fresh. They cook the meat right in front of you instead of microwaving it. I certainly would frequent them more often if there were more locations. Since I work downtown and there's one on Smithfield street, I'll definitely be back for more cause I'm STUFFED right now. Very delicious!"}
{"text":"Considering that this is in the macdonalds plaza, this is a good, healthier option to get something to eat. They have a lot of options- steak, chicken, falafel, veggie, you'll be able to find something that suits you.   Everything is cooked and prepared right in front of you, and the addons seem to be fresh.   There are several seats and a tv to watch while you eat. The staff are friendly as well.   A healthy and good tasting option when in the area."}
{"text":"Friendly and very helpful staff! Excellent pita wraps (for a large event) and fast service."}
{"text":"This is being filtered for some reason that I do not understand, but it is 100% true and accurate. I truely have never been treated so rudely in my life, and by the owner herself. Obviously coupons bother the new ownership. I had a fundraiser coupon, which I had to pay for, for a buy 1 get 1 free up to 5.99 value. My wife, son, and I ordered 3 pitas, all valued at about 6.75. We were told we couldnt order these, we had to chose from the 3 out of about 15 choices on the menu that were under 5.99. When we explained we would pay the difference to get what we wanted, we were told with a major smart ass attitude that we needed to \"read\" the coupon, it clearly states we must order something 5.99 or less. Again I asked if we could pay the .75 difference and order our $15 dollars worth of food, she explained that she was the owner, and she would not allow me to get what I wanted and chose to let us leave instead. She laughed with the other employee as I stood outside. 75 cents to lose a customer for life, and believe me, this is the first of the bad reviews and the tell a friend campaign I will be on from now on. Great business decision. I went to Greek Pita across the way in Norterra and had a great meal with excellent service and happy, not nasty, people."}
{"text":"first time.fast service..very clean..everthing was very fresh and well made...look forward to a great new choice in the area..thanks"}
{"text":"We order online from work and it's always ready on time, and done the way we've asked for it to be!  Super impressed with how quickly they're able to get their food prepared and that it's right every time!  Love the online ordering system!"}
{"text":"Love pitas and was looking forward to try pita pit. I  usually not to picky about the service. But that place left me speechless. The girl behind the counter, her name is Melanie, had not only the worst attitude, she was the rudest person ever. And she was not even trying to hide it. I didn't feel like that in awhile. Definitely not coming back. Ever."}
{"text":"Richard is by far one of the most attention to detail orientated people I have ever encountered. His customer service is top notch. Every time he has helped me he has gone above and beyond. His recommendations are always honest and good. I like the fact that he has tried pretty much everything on the menu and knows what compliments each item. I feel like he genuinely cares about my pita. I will keep coming back time after time because of Richard. He should be promoted and recognized for his dedication, hard work and people skills. His value as a person is worth much more than the position he is in. A forever customer! I plan to share this information with friends and family."}
{"text":"My boys require we eat here before every movie...the owners are almost always (if not always) onsite, and do a great job.  Awesome food! :)"}
{"text":"It was very disappointing. Half of the meat in my gyros sandwich was cold. There was very little taziki sauce on the sandwich and they used Spanish olives.  When eating a Greek gyros sandwich, Kalamata black olives should be used not Spanish olives it ruined the entire sandwich"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time, had a Chicken bacon and toppings Pita. It was REALLY good! The two girls working the counter were super friendly and informative. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite to eat! All pitas are made in front of you and they have a large selection of toppings! Everything from your normal olives, onions, green pepper, to hummus, ranch, bbq sauce, pineapple, sprouts.   Staff is always friendly and there pita's always taste great! Try the club or buffalo chicken, they are my favorites."}
{"text":"I used to eat here in college and was so excited to see this new one open up. It was great and it was quick which was nice because I was on the go. The staff was so friendly! I will definitely be back regularly."}
{"text":"Amazing pitas at reasonable prices. They load them up too! My favorites are the chicken caesar, philly steak, chicken gyro, and chicken souvlaki, but there are so many choices and you choose your own fillings. My go to place for lunch! Highly recommended hole in the wall."}
{"text":"If you are looking for something other than a typical sub sandwich or a slice of pizza for lunch, The Pita Pit is definitely a great alternative. The choice of fillings for your pita is pretty basic. It is very vegetarian friendly with almost as many veggie pitas as meat pitas. There is nothing spectacular about the place but its definitely not bad either."}
{"text":"A few friends and I traveled to Madison from Chicago to visit a college buddy who was having a housewarming. We went downtown on a Saturday and I was starving. I noticed the Pita Pit and immediately thought, can't go wrong there. Surprise, I couldn't have been more right! Forman handled our order and the entire experience was amazing. Great conversation as he masterfully created our pitas. The food was delicious! The service was even better! Thank you Pita Pit and shout out to Forman for taking care of us!"}
{"text":"First visit today. Very pleasant surprise as I didn't know what to expect. The young man that helped us was very friendly. We were unfamiliar with the menu and ordering process, so he explained everything and made suggestion. The pitas were great! We are so glad we found a place with great friendly service and a menu that fits our healthier diet choices."}
{"text":"Food was very enjoyable and made to order. What topped it off was the employees were very friendly and the store was well kept and clean. 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"IF you are reading reviews for this place- you are there at the wrong time! Come 1:30 to 3AM! This is where the party people go after the party - to get some really good mid-night food. Fun! You will see a typical downtown scene here"}
{"text":"Their black bean vegetarian option is out of this world. Good portions, good hummus. Maybe a teeny overpriced. But hey, I guess the pita business aint booming yet."}
{"text":"I use to work near this facility and one day I decided to give it a try (since its wedged between Firehous Subs and Little Cesars, I don't think it gets the foot traffic it deserves) I walked in and told the employee's I had never been their but wanted to try whatever they recommended. First time I tried the chicken souvlaki. I also went with the recommended vegies and such. Being my first time I got a hummus and pita side, not know I would be completely full after just the pita. Within the first time of trying it, I went back 3 times in 1 week. Each time trying something new, and since ive been going back at least once a week. Sometimes 3 or more times, its a good place to eat, never too busy though (location) Some of the employee's even know me by name, Always try to take new people, and love to go after a good workout / Hike."}
{"text":"Pita was good nothing special ... I got gyro pita it did not get much meat. The concept is pretty cool but not totally sold.  I enjoyed my pita but got a pita with hummus it was kinda hard after being over toasted. My only comment is the place was kinda weird because of the employees they did not say hello or goodbye they said as little possible like they hated there jobs ... Who knows."}
{"text":"Basically a it's like subway, except instead of bread, they use a pita pocket.  Good place to eat healthy, for relatively cheap."}
{"text":"They suck!! I went there at 3:20 On a Friday night when they were Supposed to be open til 4 am. Knocked On The door and the workers kept cleaning and ignoring me.  Weak."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about this place, but I love it now. So many tasty options! I really like the veggie pita, they have a lot of good veggies for it."}
{"text":"Not many other Pita places out there but Pita Pit is definitely awesome when I'm looking to eat something cleaner and still on the run with my busy schedule. I wanted to put up this review specifically for this location because it's mainly where I go. First of all I do want to comment on the food. I've never had any issues with the freshness of the vegetables. They are consistently fresh regardless of what time I step foot in the place. Second, there is quite the variety of sauces you can try which I really do appreciate. Now, the main reason for this review is because I wanted to commend the gentleman who works there. I have no idea what his name is... average height Caucasian man with long-ish hair and wears glasses. He's always there (no offense) and no one else that works there looks like him.  He's worked there for a while and I don't go on a regular basis but I can always count on him greeting me with his friendly smile each and every time I walk in there. He engages in conversation and he's quick at making my pita or salad.  He's super knowledable about the menu which is also awesome. I know, I know...what's the big deal right? But now a days, with the service I've encountered at fast food restaurants. I can't appreciate them too much. So it's really comforting to know this guy seems genuine and is consistent in how he treats his customers. I don't think it's customary to tip at fast food restaurants but the tip option is on their debit/credit machine, and I am that much more apt to tip a little something with his great attitude. Dude, if you're reading this... keep up your hard work! ! and THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"So much for ordering ahead!  I placed a to go order that was to be ready at 6:49.. When I got there at 6:53 someone else was in line ordering , they hadn't started making my order yet, AND they started the other persons order before mine. The standard for Pita Pit staff has fallen tremendously since I first visited. Guess I'll have to go to Lake Norman!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service! Every time my co-workers and I order from here we get horrible service. We have recieved refunds, free cookies and have had our orders re-delivered. Today we ordered at 12:20pm and recieved it 2 hours later and one was STILL made wrong. We work at a huge university with many options around and I will no longer order from here! Poor, poor service!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend placed an order for pickup because she's pregnant and didn't want to go out in the heat and our email confirmation said our order would be ready I  20 min. So I drove here to pick up the food and they apologized and said they don't always get notifications when an order is placed. Now after waiting another 15min I finally got my food then returned home to find out my order was incomplete."}
{"text":"So good and affordable! Can make any pita anyway you like it. I wish I lived on this side of town so that I could eat here more often."}
{"text":"I love the Pita Pit as a healthier option for fast food.  I love all of the veggies, hummus, and they have a pretty good rewards program as well.  This is a convenient location for those in the Uptown area looking for a healthier and fast lunch on the go.  The Sriracha is a great addition as well."}
{"text":"Went to Pita pit because I bought a Groupon online. I have been to them before in Sacramento where I went to college. The one in Sacramento used to skewer their chicken and Grill it. They would have it stored in a cooler and then refire the chicken with the Soulvaki sauce. It was nice real chunks of chicken that had crispy edges. I used to be addicted to this place while I was in college because it was so hot and fresh.   I was excited to try it at this location in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I'll admit, when I think of Pita Pit, I think of university. Mainly 'cause that was the last time I went to one.   But this week (after realizing my love for Pizzaiolo's being overshadowed by my body's strong dislike for clothes that fit), I've decided to give this pita joint another shot.   The pita-maker at this location was very friendly, prepping my pita in fairly good time.  The pita itself wasn't too bad. The cucumbers and alfalfa sprouts were fresh, and the chicken and olives had just enough flavour. But I probably would've liked to taste some more of the horseradish dijon mustard I was encouraged to try.   (I guess the guy didn't want to scare off repeat business by permanently burning my nasal passages.)  Unfortunately for me, the Pita Pit pita **still** fell apart half-way through my meal - just like the good old days. (Perhaps I'm just not enough of a pita pro to eat one of these without spilling the filling.)   And I know I'm probably betraying my age by asking this, but: since WHEN did Pita Pit get so expensive? $7.80 for a pita? Seriously?!   Overall, though, it was decent. And if it keeps me away from the greasy Gorgonzola and hot Italian sausage, I'm willing to try it at least once."}
{"text":"Undergrad Nostalgia.  Way back in the day, the Pita Pit used to be the after-bar stop for those McMaster students fortunate enough to live on the west side of campus (the aptly-named Westdale neighbourhood).  I stopped into the U of T location that I can only imagine serves the same purpose for a new generation of drunken twenty-somethings one metropolis over.  I wasn't sure what to expect walking in for stop ten on my birthday bender at about five on a Saturday afternoon, but I was hungry and there it was.  Had the Chicken Caesar pita; the chicken was grilled fresh and the toppings were cool and crisp.  I was well-served by the lone pita-man, but then I was the only one in there, so he was hardly as overwhelmed as I remember the Hamilton location being at 3:30AM.  My one regret is my flavour selection.  This is a delicious, garlicky pita, but it bites back for hours.  I'm pretty sure my friends didn't appreciate Caesar's return later in the evening when the effervescence of my beer blended with what had not yet been digested to deliver a unique form of aromatherapy every time I burped."}
{"text":"I see why it doesn't get 5 stars. It's basically a pita-themed Subway. I got the falafel and they asked, \"Microwaved or Grilled\", which probably shouldn't be the best way to introduce customers by using a microwave as a selling point. Overall, it's perfect for a quick bite, nothing amazing, but not bad at all. I would recommend this place for an easy in and out lunch or to grab a good, pretty healthy portable snack or dinner. I roll vegan once and a while and this works, as Pittsburgh cuisine and vegan don't usually mix. But, if you aren't picky, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great staff Richard General Managers was extremely friendly, recommended excellent Pitas, excellent customer service. Clean/great environment and fresh food, fresh veggies, great smoothies, excellent selection of Coca Cola products. I never been to a restaurant that was so friendly. Richard helped me register my pita pit card."}
{"text":"We are from Israel, and I have an obsession with my falafel and hummus. Well I went here and after seeing the menu, realized it's more of a wrap/sandwich style place and not a Mediterranean establishment.  Upon seeing that, as normal I began to walk out, when the man working nicely offered a sample and reassured me to give them a try because it was tasty. Well I must say, to that guy; you saved my opinion of the place! I ended up ordering and taking it togo..  I must say, good falafel; but extraordinary staff!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday. Loved it. Nice chicken wrap. Lots of different toppings. Fresh , healthy. Love it.  Can see me going here over subway all the time."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Two of us ordered a chicken Caesar pita and thought they were small for the $. Ordered on line, but wish we had waited because the menu was more extensive than their web site showed."}
{"text":"Not a fan of fast food or Subway/Jimmy Johns type of places. My first time at a Pita PIt, and became an instant fan!!!  And they serve breakfast all day, makes me one happy girl!!  Staff was friendly and quick even though the place was busy. I'm not from the area but visit Ohio a couple times a year and I will be definitely stopping here before heading home!"}
{"text":"Gray chicken meat, brown lettuce. Nice staff but distracted and unorganized. 2 out of 3 in our party were very dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Loveeeeeeee this place!! Wish there were more around! Food is fresh! Options are great & nothing like it around! Highly recommended it! People are down to earth & the selection is way better than a subway or any other option like it! The meals are quick & fill you up on the go with many options for toppings !"}
{"text":"Good food and fair selection. We all had dinner there one night and my kids left wanting more. Nice staff and clean environment. This a a must try if you like hot subs"}
{"text":"Pita Pit is hands down the best final stop on any downtown Charlotte drinking tour.  The line is long, but the staff is very experienced at keeping it moving.  Also, you will seldom find a more drunkenly amiable line to stand in.  I made more friends in the Pita Pit line than I made at the last Yelp event.  The food is...well...to tell you the truth I can never remember.  However, judging by the clothes I wore the night before, it can be a bit messy.  Definitely go here before passing out on your next night of revelry, your hangover will thank you."}
{"text":"The pitas are amazing, so long as you don't order on their super buggy website, or have someone lazy making your pita. Brooke makes the bombest pitas. Go Brooke. That fourth star is for you."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. Came by at 2:30 for a late night snack. Awesome staff. Can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"I lived in Moscow, Idaho (home to the second Pita Pit in the country) and lived off of Pita Pit all through school. I was so excited to see one opening so close to my house here. We went to the store the first week it opened, amazing food and great service. I just ordered one for delivery. The delivery man said I was the very first one to get it delivered. It was amazing food and came fast.   As to the guy that said it sucks. It is a PITA place, not a Gyro place. Yes, they have gyro meat and a whole lot of other things..... I have never heard anyone, or anywhere on their website, say they are the 'subway of gyros'. And as for it being more expensive than Winco..... um yep, most restaurants are more expensive than just going to the grocery store.....  The meat looks like real meat. It tastes like real meat. The veggies are fresh. The pitas are fresh. It's delicious. :)"}
{"text":"This is a quick, healthy lunch spot that I love! I like how they will grill the veggies for you. Or you can get a cold pita too. They have Mediterranean options as well as things like a buffalo chicken pita (my personal fav!)"}
{"text":"We made our way down to Pita Pit from across town because it's definitely worth making the trip for the consistent fresh food and friendly customer service.  Always have wondered why there are not more Pita Pits in the world then the McD's etc. Can't wait for more to open up around the valley :)"}
{"text":"Great little place for excellent choice of how YOU like it. Big Variety, very clean and the price is good because 2 can eat very well for under 20.00. Great lunch or lite dinner."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Pita Pit.  The choices and flavors are out of this world.  My wife and I went today and got the Buffalo Chicken and Chicken Caesar.  Staff is friendly and always quick."}
{"text":"For a fast food joint this place is great! The have tasty falafel which is really hard to find in this town. This place is really similar to subway in that you order your meal and then watch as they make it and tell them what you want in it. It is better than subway because there are more options for what to add into it as far as cheese, veggies, and sauces go. You also get a lot more food for your money and they have way more options for vegetarians. You can get either a wrap or a pita. I left full and satisfied. The people working there were very friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Not one bad thing about this place.  It's hard to find mom and pop shops in Vegas let alone ones that make you feel at home! This place has AMAZING food, always cooked to perfection and everyone there is so friendly.  I've made it a personal favourite stop for a delicious meal.  Definitely recommend this Lebanese gem!"}
{"text":"I cock-blocked with a pita . . . . =(  I discovered this place during my trip out here for work.  I went in to order a pita and as the girl at the counter was making it, a guy walks in and she gets really excited.  They chat about their plans for the night because apparently he was going laser tagging, but she has to work until 10:30pm.  She abruptly has to kill the conversation to finish my order.  Pitas should never stand in the way of love.  Like subway, but 100x better! White or wheat pita Meat:  spicy chicken, beef, falafel, badger special!!!! (potatoes, bacon, cheese, jalapeños, oinions, green peppers,nspicy sauce) and a bunch of other choices. Add ons: everything and anything:  spinach, romaine, alfalfa, tomato, hummus, olives, taziki, pickles, onions, pepperoncinis, cheddar cheese, feta cheese, etc. 9 diff sauces: mayo, sour cream, spicy chipotle, ranch, etc.  I hope I can find one in California . . . and not cock-block."}
{"text":"Fast grub hub delivery-5star. Ordered chicken souvlaki pita, dbl meat, no side. The chicken was some kind of, very small pieces of processed grilled meat. It certainly, was not double. Truthfully, barely enough for a single. I ordered double to make the order for delivery ($14.26+ $3 tip) Outside of that, the veggies in the Pita were fresh and the delivery was fast. Just very expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Needed a quick lunch, stopped in at 1230 and the line was long. I thought great.... But they are very efficient, people were moving and food was delivered. I got the Super Greek. It was delicious and pretty healthy. All the ingredients were fresh, and the wrap was tasty. Staff was polite and you could tell some of the people in line were regulars. I will definitely eat here next time I'm in town needing a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this restaurant. Being a vegetarian I'm usually forced to eat salads when I go out. They actually have several options available for vegetarians and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"I've been here before, and my experience was pretty good, but my last experience was fantastic! Great food, great service! I was here late night and my pita hit the spot. The ingredients were fresh and it didn't leave me feeling full of regret;) Don't sleep on the Thai Chicken Wrap! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy. Always fresh and a million options to choose from. AND breakfast served all day. Everyone leaves happy!"}
{"text":"Service was very slow, but food was fun and portions were great. This felt like a subway for Pitas and it was awesome! Seriously though, super slow...."}
{"text":"What a great find!  Had lunch today and ordered the chicken on whole wheat pita.  You get to choose all sort of goodies to add, including things like hummus and artichokes. The guy who helped was super friendly and helpful on some of the choices explaining what why you might like or not like something...excellent customer service in my book.  So, healthy choices, great taste and great customer service...what more could you want?!  I will certainly be returning."}
{"text":"Beat place ever I'm glad I don't have to go down town anymore I stop by here twice a week before work love this place"}
{"text":"Great food and very clean. You have to make things a combo by spending about 2 extra bucks but besides that everything is pretty much perfect"}
{"text":"For a fast food pita place, it's excellent. Fresh veggies, decent hummus, friendly staff. A little pricey though."}
{"text":"Why would you eat here when you can eat at DOLCE WRAPS right next door and DOLCE is locally owned!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered on yelp. Pita was made quickly but amount of meat in Gyro pita was pretty awful. About 75% at most of what you would expect. 50% of Mike and Tony's gyros."}
{"text":"I know it's new but.....lettuce was old, pita was soggy, meat was fatty...the young man who made my sandwich didn't know what went inside. Also, if you're having trouble with rolls and responsibilities, don't argue with each other at the cash register where we can hear you. $7 wasted."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. I really like the Spicy Black Bean pitas. The service is good, probably because you literally just tell them what you want, just like Subway. Overall, it's a pretty good restaurant. You should check it out, at least just once."}
{"text":"I've probably had a few hundred chicken caesar pitas between lunch between classes and then later lunch while at work.. love love LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Very amazing and upfront about the allergens in their food. I can't eat soy so I was able to eat the chicken souvlaki with tzatziki sauce on wheat pita with veggies. So delicious!"}
{"text":"I love the healthier options. Always fills me up and their smoothies are great too. You can add spinach for free to any smoothie and a scoop of whey protein for 1.99. I love the chocolate banana yogurt smoothie!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend who highly recommended it, and I'm a big fan and ready to join the Mosh Pit.  It's like a Chipotle assembly line setup where you order your proteins which they grill hot in front of you, and pass you down the line to select your favorite veggies, sauces and other toppings, and they roll it into a nice easy to eat fresh pita (choice of white or wheat).  This think is easy to eat, and doesn't spill all over your suit....and it fills you up, but in a fresh non-gut bomb sort of way that normal monster burritos do.  The chicken breast I had was fresh white meat (non-grizzle) and perfect.  I shall return to the pit of glory."}
{"text":"Good selection, great service and reasonable prices makes Pita Pit a winner in my books.  I was in the mood for a quick but reasonably healthy lunch and decided to give Pita Place a try. Walking in the door, the first thing you notice is the small space and lack of seating (only 4 chairs and a small bench). Don't let this put you off.  The menu itself is very comprehensive with lots of options for meat lovers and vegetarians alike. They also have salads along with the regular pitas if that's what you're craving.  The staff are very friendly and like chatting with customers as they wait for their orders which is nice. $8 for a fresh, tasty lunch served with a smile means Pita Pit is definitely worth trying if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place, always get the Light Mediterranean and it's great, very filing but without a heavy feeling...sort of lime eating a Subway sandwich but tastier."}
{"text":"My sexy boyfriend and I have been riding here from Phoenix every other Friday on and off, for two years. Over the two years, we've seen a lot of changes to this place. One, being that a lot of the good employees are disappearing. Two, you have to ask for the staff to open the restrooms. Three.....I guess there's not a three...but anyway....Every trip there this year has been sucking each time. Tonight was probably the last time we'll go. There were three dudes, 1 was actually good at what he was doing. The other two could care less about helping you out. We didn't get to eat our food inside because they had to \"take care of something for a little bit\" and they had to lock the store up. There's nothing good about this place anymore."}
{"text":"Harkening back to my university days, I had a craving for a late night pita, post drinking.  A quick detour on my bike up Spadina and along College brought me to Pita Pit, though not one I've ever been to.  (I went to Ryerson so frequented the Gerrard St Pita Pit)   The purveyor of pitas was a friendly, innocent looking girl, however it quickly became apparent that she knew nothing of the pita business.  I don't blame her however as this is an obvious lack of training by management.  I got my classic choice of a Chick Crave pita: grilled chicken and ham with melted swiss.  I also got sauteed mushrooms and onions which makes for a delicious combo.  Unfortunately however I had to instruct on the whole sauteing process, and asking for the swiss to be melted over the chicken was completely out of the question.  Nonetheless, this combo of ingredients should provide a tasty snack once rolled into one delicious bread based receptacle.   Unfortunately putting the ingredients into the pita seemed beyond the ability of this poor woman and it ended up completely broken apart.  I biked home and had to eat it with a fork and knife.  I will say though that, aside from the superfluous iceberg lettuce, most bites tasted delicious.  It just takes the fun out of a late night hankering when it has to be shoveled in piece by piece with a fork.  I may just have to bike back to Ryerson some night to finally satisfy my craving that still remains."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery from them.. and I'm confused. My gyro doesn't taste like a gyro? It tastes more like something I'd order from taco bell. Yuck. The tzatziki sauce was awful!!! It had no taste. I hand the girl 10 dollars and she asks if I want my change.. no you're all set. She looked so confused and frustrated! I'm tipping you..  Visibly irritated to accept a tip? Am I missing something here? Not a place I'd eat at again. (The lady who took my order was VERY friendly though! So props to her) Go to Dolce Wraps if you want flavor and real Mediterranean."}
{"text":"Food here is good and they are usually pretty quick.  A lot of people complaining  about service but it is staffed by high schoolers so you cant go in expecting a sit down experience. The place is clean and the food is good. If youre looking for an alternative to burgers and pizza I think its a good choice. Im about to get some now."}
{"text":"I'm so glad there's another option for healthy eating, today I tried the chicken souvlaki (Mediterranean seasoned chicken) and it was deeeeLicious!  Great customer service and the restaurant was nice & clean,  yup I'll be back =)"}
{"text":"I think I may like Pita Pit a little too much!  Quick tip: Monday through Friday between 5 Pm to 7 PM, it's happy hour which is buy 3 pitas, get 1 free. And also, DOUBLE MEAT FOR 99 cents.   It's honestly my go to place for quick, yet relatively healthy food. One of the beauties of this place is that you can choose what vegetables you want and the save you want.   I normally get the Philly on wheat pita with the peppers, mushrooms and onions grilled with it. This may sound odd, but I usually get teriyaki sauce on my Philly and it's amazing. Again, it's part of the beauty where you can try different flavors out."}
{"text":"Food was ok, staff helpful and accommodating but inexperienced.  Different people every time I go. Way too expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick, flavorful lunch. To be perfectly honest, I'm not a huge fan of pitas because the ones I make myself turn out nasty and the ones I've had elsewhere haven't been much better.   The main problem I've seen in pita construction is the ingredients are inserted into yo pita in layers. This means you experience them in layers, in reverse order, as well. Say you stuffed yours with chicken, olives, lettuce, oil, and spices. Well, you will then taste...spices, oil, lettuce, olives, and chicken. Just like that.  Not here! They mix it well more like a subway sandwich (I'm a huge subway fan), and it all blends together like a beautiful orchestra.   Top ingredients, salad, options, and more too. Friendly crew working the counter as well.   I now appreciate the art of the pita."}
{"text":"Good stuff. So happy it's basically across the street. Fresh ingredients. Love that you pick your protein and load it up with all you want. Good price too! I'm addicted."}
{"text":"We came around 1 for lunch just to give it a try. It seemed pretty disorganized, which seemed to be the theme upon a quick glance of other Yelp reviews. The girl who took our order was nice, however.   Essentially how it works is you order what kind of protein you want in your pita, walk around to the toppings station and go down the line of telling them what you want. You can see everything and all the vegetables looked fresh. Nothing skeeves me more than gross vegetables. They had hummus, avocados, and tzatziki, which was nice.   It's essentially a pita burrito, if that at all makes sense. It was a pretty good alternative to just a normal sub. I got grilled chicken for $7 and loaded it up with a bunch of vegetables, which are all included. I like this system. I'm not a fan of chain restaurants at all, but this is probably on the upper level side of chain sandwich places. Not really anything I'm rushing back for, however."}
{"text":"With plenty of great restaurants in downtown Charlotte, this is not where I'd choose to eat a regularly scheduled meal.    On the other hand, at two o'clock on a chilly December morning I can't imagine anything better than a hot, tightly wrapped philly cheese steak pita sandwich from the Pita Pit.  There might be a long line, but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"I haven't had any issues with the food I have ordered here but the online ordering is just a pain! The 3 times I've used it I've had nothing but issues and the most recent time my order got double and I ended up paying $20 more than I should have."}
{"text":"I'm not basing this review on food or service. I've eaten at Pita Pit before. My wife and I decided to check out this location on Sunday for dinner since we were in the area. To my surprise, this location closes at 3pm on Sundays. What restaurant closes before dinner? It's just stupid. That's why they get a 1 because their hours on Sundays are stupid."}
{"text":"Why would you ever go to Subway when you have the best pita joint in Scarborough close by? This is health fast food at it's best.  I would know, I love Pitas and I work in the area so I've done my fair share of checking around. They make a great lunch or dinner.  This location consistently has fresh crisp vegetables and the friendliest staff. They never skimp on the fillings, in fact they stuff it which is what keeps me coming back again and again.   Looking for a cheap meal? They offer $5.00 Pita's including: turkey, gyro, cheese, or veggie! Such a bargain!   There is also a catering menu with very reasonably priced platters.  I really don't know what more I could ask for in a Pita place...except maybe accepting my credit card, it's cash or debit only.  $5 footlongs move over! $5 pitas are where it's at!"}
{"text":"We have ordered from here a few times. I love that you can order exactly what you want online so there's no confusion about what exactly you want. Due to it being close to closing once we couldn't order online but they took our phone order and everything was ready promptly. It's not always easy to find something that everybody in the family wants to eat so I save this gem for when I travel with the family in the Madison area. My little one loves pitas and my husband and I like the various combinations on the menu."}
{"text":"I have been to a dozen Pita Pits from Ohio all the way to Texas and this was the WORST EVER. I order the same pita every time - Buffalo Chicken. The girl who made my pita not only filled it with toppings to the point where it just ripped in half (how am I supposed to eat that?), but she forgot the Buffalo sauce. LOL. Came home to be very disappointed that a task sooooo simple was done wrong. Besides that, the place was so dirty and gross-  I should've known the pitas wouldn't be any better. Needless to say, I will never go back to this location again."}
{"text":"Really cool spot i like that you can design your own pita by choosing everything from the meat to veggies and sauces. The staff was really cool and polite . a really cool spot to stop by for a quick bite"}
{"text":"Stopped in finally after my vegetarian wife insisted we try it.   Picked up two Falafel pitas per the girls suggestion for a first timer.  My wife wasn't present.   To go please.  Sat down and waited.  Another employee walked in and started talking to her.   A bit later she came out with two pita''s clearly not ready to walk out the door.  Simple said these were to go and she turned around and walked back.  5 minutes later she walked over again with the two sandwich and no bag.  Asked politely if she had a bag and she said yes, would you like one?  I decided to wait at the counter because she clearly kept loosing focus.  Handed me my food and I left.   My wife's initial response.  Was this made today???  Yuck.   Head out to Chipotle honey.  I just guessing that this place has potential but lacks management to watch over this place until they get some good employees..  Said we really need healthy options in this area."}
{"text":"Outstanding, fresh sandwiches.  Need more pita pit's around, instead of just being near college campus's"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to get and the Dagwood is the way to go.  Great suggestions on toppings and very fresh."}
{"text":"When I think of a pita, I think of the dry tasteless kind you get at the grocery store. This was my first time to any type of restaurant pita place. I was quite surprised by the softness of the bread. It was thin and like a wrap that stretched around the ingredients placed inside!  We ordered a Gyro Pita and a Chicken Souvlaki Pita. The Chicken Souvlaki we ordered as a salad at no extra charge. The meat is grilled when you order. The meat in both was very tender. The counter person asked if we wanted the standard ingredients that came with each sandwich. She also let us know that we could add extra ingredients of our choosing. The food was prepared quickly. Everything was fresh. They have chips available. Love the coke machine with all the choices. Had a diet root beer. Something I seldom find when eating out.  We asked and signed up for their rewards card that allows you to collect points with every purchase and earn free food. They also have an app for your phone that allows you to order ahead of time.  The dining room is a bit sterile, but overall was clean. Customer service good! Prices good!"}
{"text":"Delicious food in this establishment hidden behind the QT off of highway 74 in Indian Trail. Great lunch spot. Fair prices and the level of tastiness is un paralleled when compared to other sandwich spots like subway."}
{"text":"When you have a little happiness going on, nothing hits the spot like cheap, quick carbohydrates. Enter, Pita Pit. In the days before EpiCentre food, this was a crucial way-station between Cosmos Cafe and various other nightlife venues. Crucial as in \"must eat here now or basic metabolic processes will cease.\" At least, that's what it felt like.  I can't imagine that this place would be satisfying during the daylight hours. Yet after dark it is essential."}
{"text":"I have tried many pitas in Mississauga from various establishments. Pita pit definitely takes the cake (or pita?)!  They grill the green pepper and onions which makes alllllll the difference!  The toppings are limitless and always fresh. The prices are moderate- competitive with Extreme Pita. I have had very friendly customer service in this location and is a big reason behind why I keep returning.. not to mention their Donair sauce is amazing!"}
{"text":"DELIVERY IS TERRIBLE! It's the main reason why I'm giving this place a lower score. Takes hours after the ETA and the food is always cold or soggy. One time I ordered a pita at 11:30PM and didn't receive it until 2:00AM. Driver had to keep calling me to wake me up. Absolutely RIDICULOUS that the past few times I've ordered from this place it has been the same terrible delivery service!   Besides that, food is good. I would suggest going in the store."}
{"text":"This place is the perfect lunch spot!  They get you in and out quickly.  Today was my 3rd or 4th time here and I highly recommend it.  The gyro pita is by far my favorite!  The ingredients are very fresh.  You get a very large amount of food for the money.  They have a variety of healthy choices if you choose those.  Like them on Facebook to see what the $3.99 deal of the day is!"}
{"text":"Food was great, staff was friendly, and the place was clean.  I had a chicken souvlaki pita, and it was wonderful."}
{"text":"Love this place! I love the options available to choose what to put into your pita. Everything is prepared in front of you. No surprises behind the doors. Good staff and clean place. Good location as well."}
{"text":"I like this place.   the pitas i've had here are so much better than the ones i've had in Fairlawn. the food seems more fresh and they have a Coca Cola Freestyle machine! in fact, now i'm craving it. darn.  they do have to work on customer service though. they workers are usually socializing with friends who might stop in or are in the back unavailable to customers who might want to order something more or have an issue. I've been in twice and both times the employees' socializing was irritating."}
{"text":"Think subway but with pitas. They have a variety of meat options that they heat up on a skillet for you and then you pick your toppings. They have a large variety of veggies, cheeses and sauces to choose from. They are good and if you are health conscious you can create a low fat, low calorie pita here. They also have vegetarian and breakfast options. Have always been pleased with my food here but it's nothing to rave about. Staff has always been super nice and it is very clean."}
{"text":"I just tried to order food within the past 5 minutes. I walked in and the music was so loud when I said/yelled hello no one heard me. So I then called from my phone while standing at the register and a girl came out. Didn't say sorry, hello, nothing. And when I asked/shouted if she was gonna turn the music down she shook her head no. There was absolutely no reason for the music to be so loud I could heart from outside. I work in the area and was so excited when I saw this place was opening. To bad you lost my business and everyone who asks me when to go."}
{"text":"The ingredients are always fresh and I like that I can customize everything. The price for the pita/salad is reasonable, but after the delivery fee of $3, it can be pricey. Definitely a great option if I forget my lunch at home."}
{"text":"I love this franchise.  Its delicious and healthy.  The classic chicken with all the veggies and feta they have is always my go to.  They have a subway style of stuffing their pitas, I absolutely love this place... Have I said that yet?"}
{"text":"this use to be a favorite and the pictures posted are what pitas used to look like. management changed recently and staff, go to get pit in middle guy tells me if I want more tomatoes it will cost $2.00 new thing they have...Hugh? I wanted to leave and so did my friend I never heard such a thing before!  my pita was size of a McDonald's dollar menu burrito ate it we went to el polo loco to finish eating. I'll never go back $20 spent on a tease snack! this is the last location open in town no wonder/ don't see this one going far either."}
{"text":"Pita Pit was my fave when I lived in Columbus, but I can't say the same about this location.  Granted, I was only here once, but it wasn't a good experience.  The food was poorly made, and they wouldn't accept my gift certificate because neither worker knew how to ring it up that way.  It was a few months after this particular Pita Pit opened so maybe things have changed, but I haven't been back to find out."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service, employees have horrible attitude, district manager yelled at me until I cried. Employees argue with you about how to make your pita. Getting the pita made the way you ask (within reason) is supposed to be the whole point of pita pit. Very poorly managed store/district."}
{"text":"I decided to come here one day after class because I haven't really tried the food places off of Maryland Parkway. But the only problem was that when I got out of class and headed over there, they weren't open! They opened at 10:30am everyday and I was thirty minutes too early so I hung out somewhere else.  When 10:30am rolled around, I headed there. The guy behind the counter was friendly and I ordered a breakfast pita - the Morning Glory (Eggs, Hashbrowns, Tomatoes, Grilled Onions & Green Peppers, Cheddar Cheese). I paid for my pita and waited for the guy to make my food.  I sat down at a table to eat the pita and it was delicious. I ate up everything and I kinda wanted more."}
{"text":"Disorganized, staff that didn't know the menu.  I was expecting something like Garbanzos, but found this was just sandwiches on pitas.  Staff didn't know how to make a gyro! The meat was barely cooked, I ended up throwing it away."}
{"text":"I LOVE this location and this chain! We will start the review off with the staff:  - the staff are outstanding! They are friendly, knowledgeable, bubbley and always have a smile on their face.   The food is fresh, fast, convienant and delicious. I strongly recommend the chicken souvlaki!   You gotta check these guys out"}
{"text":"Came here on my friends recommendation and I am glad I did. Very fresh and tasty. I ordered the Philly Steak and it delivered!"}
{"text":"Truly the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The employees walked around aimlessly, never smiled, talked extremely quietly unless they were discussing sports between themselves, and treated my guest and I horribly. I even tried to thank them at the end of the night as we were leaving and they completely ignored me. I suppose they were very busy watching the TV they have in the corner.   I contacted Pita Pit corporate about this, who forwarded my very detailed explanation of what happened to the franchise owners at this specific location. Dennis Manning, co-owner of this location, responded by dismissing my comments due to my admission that the food was good. He assumed, \"based on my timeline\" that my food was created within 5 minutes of the time I ordered it and that somehow makes the horrible visit perfectly fine in his mind? He proceeded to bash me for saying that I felt uncomfortable based on what he calls the employee's \"poor interpersonal skills\". What a disgusting attitude to have toward an honest guest.   The place was extremely dirty with tables askew, wrappers everywhere, and dirt all over the tables.   I am absolutely certain that a different Pita Pit would be good, but this one is awful. The food was good, and the idea behind the Pita Pit itself is great too, but the fact that the employee walked over to the register and blankly stared at me with all-but a scowl when I initially entered was ridiculous.   I wish I had never gone here. The employees made me and my guest feel more than just uncomfortable. They made me feel 100% unwelcome. It left a terrible taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I LOVE the Pita Pit. It's one of my absolute favourite places in the city because not only do they serve reasonably-priced and delicious food, but they serve HEALTHY food. That makes my heart happy.  My favourite thing to order at 'The Pit' is the Garden Pita with Hummus and swiss cheese. OH MY GOD. SO good.   It's the perfect meal to grab and go. It's not messy, so you can feel assured eating and walking down 17th.  The only thing I wish is that The Pita Pit carried an egg salad pita option. As if that wouldn't be SO good eh?!?!  Ah well, with or without the egg salad, it's STILL the bomb. Hell, I'm heading over right now!"}
{"text":"Pita Pit served up some very tasty and healthy food. Friendly staff and clean facilities."}
{"text":"We ordered two different sandwiches. We had one gyro sandwich and a chicken Caesar sandwich. They were so small with barely any meat in them that we are still hungry. We did get the small size but the amount of food that was in it was ridiculous. The Caesar tasted delicious but the gyro was awful. The staff was friendly, no complaints there. It did take about 10-15 minutes due to the amount of people. But I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Don't bother, visited here a few weeks ago. The lady who served me was very unfriendly, obviously hated being there which I view as a reflection of the work environment and possibly management (There was a \"hiring\" sign in the window, wouldn't be surprised if there is a high turnover rate.. even for a Pita Pit) The ingredients were below par, the restaurant looked very unkept and I couldn't wait to get out of there.  Never again, at least for this location."}
{"text":"Extremely poor quality food. The majority of our chicken was fat, and my wife and I both returned our food and got our money back after pulling chicken bones out of our sandwiches. The flavor was bland and the customer service below average. Don't come here if you want anything with meat."}
{"text":"It was okay....I ordered a buffalo chicken pita but it didn't have any sauce.   So it was essentially a grilled chicken pita.    I also ordered a salad to eat later, and they delivered it all to my hotel.  WITHOUT utensils.  Really?  It should be known that if you are delivering food to a hotel, the customer, 100% of the time, needs the proper means to eat it.    Food was decent, but for the price of the food plus delivery, and the fact that they didn't bring utensils and the buffalo chicken wasn't really buffalo chicken...it kinda sucked."}
{"text":"Well I ate.. Questioned the clenliness, then got the squirts for 4 days.  Gross pretty much sums it up."}
{"text":"I was thinking this was going to be like subway but with pita bread and it kinda is but the meat and veggies are better quality. You can get lamb, beef, chicken and you can add just about any veggie to the pita pocket. Not much to say other than the restaurant was clean and staff was friendly and the food was actually good. I'll be back and you should give this place a try."}
{"text":"NOTE- it is NOT on Tryon...it is on College St, between 5th and 6th, right across from Merts Heart and Soul.  I had the Chicken Souvlaki- was really good. Very healthy- all the sandwiches are around 300-400 calories. I like the Subway-esque topping bar at the end, you can add any veggies or sauces (hummus, hot sauce, tzatziki, etc)."}
{"text":"Drove in from Southern California, We went to the pita pit and had an excellent lunch there Cameron and Kevin provided excellent customer service very helpful with the menu items. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"Good healthy food and great service. Priced just right too. They also have a freestyle machine. The owner and staff are extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Literally the worst experience ever. We walked in and the employee that was working was an African American man..wearing a Chicago bulls hat (doubt its mandatory attire) and blasting rap music. I'm all for different music and not even one to complain but it was so obscene and so inappropriate at a family friendly place. So me and my friend walked in and the music was so loud and we felt extremely uncomfortable! Then he had an attitude and didn't even want to help us and had the audacity to try and charge us for hummus and avocado after we had already paid. After we got our food the music was still blasting and I'm not being dramatic the music was extreme and definitely not welcoming! Seriously hope u talk to this terrible employee. He's the only one that is ever working here..each time I've come in he's there and definitely not good for business. Won't ever return!"}
{"text":"Management has changed. Service has been a hit or miss since the change. Overall, still a decent place to grab a quick pita sandwich in uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times for lunch and got the buffalo chicken pita. They're always very quick here which is convenient. The staff is always friendly. The quality of the chicken is decent. No complaints at all. They're chocolate chip cookies are really soft and taste homemade if you're looking for a snack! I'd come back again."}
{"text":"The Gyro is not fresh cut it is pre packaged huge disappointment!"}
{"text":"don't waste your money!! this place is terrible .. I paid $8 for a small ham pita ..they don't even load it up with veggies. I asked for romaine..and it was like the girl literally counted out 3 pieces.. seriously? lettuce doesn't cost anything!! I asked for mushrooms..got 5 half pieces.. super cheap on toppings. I could have went to subway and got more food for the price I paid.   I've been to many other pita pits and they LOAD your pita up with meat and whatever toppings you want.. this place is a joke  Wish I could rate lower than 1 star"}
{"text":"Went in for a bite to eat on the go, manager was really cool and informative about any menu questions I had. Food was delicious (I got the chicken cesar pita). Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I must say, this place is amazing!! The atmosphere and staff are great, and the food is even better. The owners are almost always on site, and are very easy to talk to. Plus with all the healthy options how can you go wrong! 5 stars, 2 thumbs up, if you have not been here you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Don't go to this location!! Horrible. I have gone to another location and had an amazing experience. This location had 2 staff who rushed threw cooking the meat and left it super slimy."}
{"text":"Always have had fast & friendly service at this location! It's located in the Hearst Tower on the South College side. If you're an employee of Hearst Tower... show your badge for $1 off a Pita!  My go-to Pita is a \"Local Best\" choice -- the Hawaiian. They do the teriyaki chicken with ham and pineapple. This one is a definite crowd pleaser, especially since you can load it up exactly the way you want.  They also have a special called \"Super Greek\" that is half chicken Souvlaki & half gyro (lamb).    Hummus & guac are free to add to your pita ... love that!"}
{"text":"Store was dirty but the staff was very nice. The food reminds me of A pita version of Subway. It's probably a pass."}
{"text":"Holy balls!  What a shit show!  How about having an adult help run the place?!?  Let me preface this that I really, really wanted to like this place, being that it's so close to my house.   I waited 25 minutes for two pitas.  The cook forgot my double meat, which I had already paid $2.00 for. They asked me if I had wanted double meat and I told them that that was what I had ordered. They told the cook to throw some more meat on the grill, but at that point I just wanted to get the F out of there. I told them to forget the extra meat and said that I just wanted to leave. The girl, obviously seeing that I was irritated, handed me my food, smirked at me and said \"Have a great day!\".  As for the food, it was ok. All processed meats. I probably could've made it at home."}
{"text":"Nice addition to the UNLV area!  If you're a vegetarian, vegan, or simply like having a plethora of vegetables for your sandwiches, you will probably love Pita Pit.  The black bean patty is excellent and makes for a substantial sandwich.  The base of your sandwich (falafel, meat, veggie option, etc.) is always cooked fresh.  Pita Pit also allows you as many vegetable toppings as you want, without charging you extra for items such as artichokes, hummus, or avocado (unlike Cafe Rio next door that nickel and dimes you for just about everything).  The pita is very large but thin enough that you don't get too much bread.  Customer service has been excellent every time I've been in there.  My only beef - hehehe - would be some of the meat options.  The souvlaki was excellent, but the heated deli meats wind up tasting pretty weird. I gave in and tried a Dagwood.  It probably would have been better without grilling.  In short, I really do like this place and highly recommend it.  It's more affordable than other options nearby, like Einstein's and Cafe Rio, and you get more food for your money."}
{"text":"***attention manager****  your employees are going to make someone very sick!!!!!! ***attention manager****   someone should let the employees know that wearing gloves doesn't keep food clean when they use the same gloves to take money from customers.  i really hope you're not training these employees to do this. it's disgusting and dangerous.   ***attention manager****  your employees are going to make someone very sick!!!!!! ***attention manager****"}
{"text":"A bit more disappointed on my second trip here.  The staff seem to be mostly college students, so it's luck of the draw if you get one who actually takes care in preparing your sandwich.  Tonight, mine didn't.  I ordered the chicken breast pita with spinach and mushrooms and asked that they grill up the veggies with the meat.  I watched the guy make it and he left the veggies on the cooktop for a whopping 2 minutes, so they didn't cook at all.  When I bit into the pita, I further discovered that the chicken was only lukewarm and the pita bread was a bit on the stale side.   I'm not saying I'll never go back here again, I just wish service was more consistent."}
{"text":"OOO Pita Pit...how you make me park illegally outside of your establishment for your delicious pitas...  Cheap, Fast, Easy, Delicious  Pros: HUMMUS is Yummus.  Grilled (warm) turkey on a salad makes it taste more like a meal and less like rabbit food, also you can have them grill your veggies for a sneaky way to get double veggies.  Great selection of veggies and sauces/dressings. Fast. Healthy. Outdoor seating.   Cons: Very limited options for a side besides chips and a cookie. No soup? No Fruit? Come on P-Pit!   Overall: Great Spot for a healthy lunch in the Southside! Somewhere you can actually eat during the busy lunch hour without having to box out other 9 to 5ers.     FYI: Hummus is extra but if you don't get cheese its free!"}
{"text":"Amazing healthy food and super nice staff!! Thanks Leigh for an awesome time! So glad there's healthy tasty options so close to work. Even better that you cater which we need in tax season big time!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch in search of something new and healthier than a burger and fries. This place was great! You order your choice of meat first then move to the end of the counter to customize your pita while they cook the meat on a grill in front of you. I saw the comparison to Subway in other reviews and in my opinion the only comparison is perhaps the business model (the concept of customizing your food). The quality however is not comparable. I don't have anything against Subway, but based on my experience with both restaurants, Pita Pit exceeds in quality of ingredients, customer service, and cleanliness. I like it, I'll be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  Yes, you'll pay eight bucks for a pita, but, they're farging huge.  And, they're delicious.  I do wish they had a small size.  That way, my tiny wife would be able to finish hers, and I could get two different ones.  Tons of options, you can get a different pita every time  I was surprised by so many reviewers complaining about rude service.  We've always been treated really well.  We've had a few awkward, less-than-adequately-trained employees, but we've always got what we wanted (no that one...a little more please...perfect!).  A few reviewers also compared Pita Pit's food with another place a short distance away.  The other place is a nice sit-down restaurant with good food (things you can't get at Pita Pit) and great service.  But, my wife and I both like Pita Pit's pitas better."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews I was super excited to try vegetarian friendly food in a new place! I am always curious how other states cater to a different audience.   I had the falafel. I was very impressed with the fact that the counters were cleaned to be devoid of meat, and the worker who filled my pita changed her gloves since she handled meat, in the previous orders.  This is where it starts and ends.  The ingredients, the veggies were eh. About 2 days away from being spoiled/ tossed.   The dressings tasted watered down!  The hot sauce had the consistency of 10% pepper and 90% water!   The falafel, the food I am so fond of. The food that I think is rather difficult to mess up. The fried balls of semi-healthy goodness were a DISASTER! They tasted like microwaved vegetable balls. DEFINITELY NOT WHAT FALAFEL is supposed to taste like.   A shame that people here can not fully absorb the experience of amazing food/falafel. I suggest buying a deep fryer, getting some chickpeas, and a recipe on-line and make them yourself.  It's a no go here. 1 star for food. 3 for the consideration."}
{"text":"The first few times I went there it was really good but I went there today and my Pita was half the size that it normally is for $8 I don't think so"}
{"text":"Coming here reminded me of the lovely college days.. the constant need for easy, cheap and large-portioned foods. A hole in the wall kinda place with a hot grill and a nice arrangement of veggies, condiments and various sauces. I ordered the Grecian Delight and deee-lightful it was! There is a vast selection of pitas on the menu. The concept is basically a pita reflection of subway sandwiches. Choose your hearts' desire from the menu and add as many toppings as you please. Very good, filling and cheap. Best part? We totally jammed out to old school R&B playing through the night (BONUS POINTS for good choice in music)!"}
{"text":"This is the only Pita Pit location I have tried, but the two teenaged staff were not organized or efficient at the Greenfield location.  The restaurant also appeared to be understaffed for the number of customers waiting to be served in line.  All of the customers looked annoyed.  It took at least a 1/2 hour between waiting to place an order and having the food being prepared (out of customer order -- customers behind us were served before).   Additionally, the soda machine was out of several drink flavors.  Finally, our debit receipt was not given to us; we were told we had to wait until the food was prepared, and then the server neglected to put the receipt in the bag with our food.  The food itself was not especially appetizing.  The meats and falafel were pre-cooked, pre-measured portions that were merely warmed on the grill (gross). The veggies and other add-ins looked very much like a Subway sandwich counter. The whole experience was poorly handled, over-priced for what we received, and time-consuming. We will not return."}
{"text":"The food is great and so is the service!  The people are very friendly and are always willing to help whenever needed. I love the philly cheese steak they have, it is simply delicious! I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"This place lost its appeal real fast. Big, greasy, fast food pitas were only good the first couple of times. It kind of grosses me out now, actually."}
{"text":"Newly opened Pita Pit near downtown so plenty of promotions and deals going on. I've had Pita Pit in the past so it's nice to see they are making a comeback. Kind of like a subway with choosing your ingredients but in a Pita. Nice clean new restaurant and friendly staff. Some of the staff is a bit slow with putting your Pita together but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt since it's new and they are probably still getting used to things. Good quick food to grab on you lunch hour."}
{"text":"I love pita pit. The food is awesome and fast. However, very rarely do I ever complain let alone write a yelp review but today was ridiculous. I walked in on a time crunch and the girl working was standing next to the register taking a call on her cell phone. I stood there for a couple minutes and not once did she even acknowledge my existence. I turned around and left and went to jimmy johns. If she would have acknowledged me, I would have stayed. Clearly a training issue. I'll stick to the downtown location from now on."}
{"text":"Awesome Greek Wrap. Reminded me college days with friendly over the counter girl managing whole place (taking order, cooking and packing). I enjoyed this quick take out meal."}
{"text":"Attentive and warm staff, great selection of healthy pitas and dairy free options on their delicious smoothies without breaking the bank - Pita Pit just knocked Subway off the sandwich throne."}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly.   I see in previous posts that there was no seating then, but I went in today and there were 4 chairs and a table.  The guy who runs this place is nice and gave us a discount.    He's very positive about Pita Pit and really believes he's offering a healthy and economic choice to higher fat fast food.   I agree with him, Pita Pit is a good option."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. I may have to work this place in to my regular rotation. As other reviewers have mentioned, this place is like Subway/Qdoba. You pick your base protein, and everything else is pretty much customizable. You choose between white or wheat pitas, and you have a wide choice of add-ons, even some Mediterranean stuff such as hummus . Avocado spread does not carry an extra charge. And there are a wide range of sauces. Being a \"healthy\" joint, they also carry a lot of smoothies. I question how healthy smoothies really are, but that's another debate. Smoothies are the expensive items on their menu. Today was my most recent visit. I had the Chicken Souvlaki with a Mango Tango smoothie. The price point for the pita seems to be slightly less than most of Subway's footlong sandwiches, which is awesome since I think the food is much better than Subway anyways. And with the Yelp check-in 10% off coupon, this was a great deal. I spent just under $11 before tip. As far as how healthy this place is, well, that's entirely dependent on your self-control. If you eat your pita straight as it is, then yes, it's healthy. But if you have to have potato chips and cookies, and you have to drench your pita with dressing and sauce, then you've just defeated the purpose of eating healthy. That being said, even if your goal isn't to eat healthily, this place is still a tasty option to change things up once in a while."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for lunch today not wanting \"fast food\" yet again during errand Saturday. We had a falafel pita and a spicy black bean pita. I honestly had no high hopes for this place. We'd had pita wraps before that were pretty tasteless. I must say we were presently surprised! We both enjoyed our pita wraps and will most certainly be going back. The staff was very helpful as this was our first visit. Yum!"}
{"text":"Haven't had Pita Pit in years and this location definitely helped me relive the good memories from many years ago! The staff was super friendly and courteous and my pita was delicious!"}
{"text":"Seriously. How could you not like a pita crammed full of veggies, falafel, hummus, tzatziki, and hot sauce? I used to frequent Pita Pit in FL and this one carries forth the glory of pita greatness.   I always order something different. Falafel, chicken, steak, just straight veggies...it's always good. I love that they cram as much as you want into those poor pitas. Who cares, though. The more everything drips and falls out of your pita, the more enjoyable it is! Maybe sit and eat it though...Not exactly street food if half of it falls out onto the street.   Pretty cheap, too. We always eat with drinks and a bag of chips for around $15. Also, these dudes are open super late. Great when you're in Uptown after everything else has closed on a Monday night.   The only downside of this location is the parking situation. Shocking. Uptown is always a pain to navigate if you're in or on any sort of motorized vehicle. We usually park at 7th street and make it a quick trip to go."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favourite pita pit location. They're extremely friendly here, it is always clean here, the food is always fresh and it's never busy which is a huge plus.  We travel from Kennedy and Vodden area to go to this location (so we are definitely closer to other pita pits) but the service is so much different at this location - especially the men who work here! The guys seem to really joke around and enjoy their jobs.   We have ordered from this location too with no complaints. The order came in quick and everything was right.   Keep doing what you're doing!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came in looking for a quick and tasty dinner, but we left with so much more. We were greeted by the manager, Richard, who gave us a helpful rundown of the new menu. We became fast friends. Their new menu offers classic pitas, fancy pitas, and diy pitas. I had the Philly Pita with red peppers. It was everything I hoped it would be. My husband tried the cheeseburger pita--salad style, per Richard's suggestion. The food was great, but the service we received is the reason I'm giving them a 5 star review. It was almost closing time when we walked in so we felt bad, but Richard's kindness and patience as we looked over the menu deserves some recognition. Thanks Richard!"}
{"text":"In a fair disclaimer, no Pita Pit will ever out rank the Flagstaff Pita Pit. When you've spent late nights after studying, weekends when you're out on adventures and great times re-living your college youth in a downtown restaurant, I find it hard to believe you can safely compare it to another.   Regardless, this one is great and delicious. The staff is helpful with suggestions on fillers, parking is easy and the food is good. They did forget the cheese on the boy's philly cheesesteak, which is the reason for the 4/5. And the prices have gone up. But we are looking to move to the area, and will definitely go back for another try if/when we do."}
{"text":"I just tried this place on saturday. I already returned back on monday. Lol. This place has really good soft pitas that are steamed to perfection.  The toppings are fresh. The chicken meat was awesome. Did I mention....There guacamole is the bomb. Plus add artichoke! ! Needless to say. Don't forget your rewards card. I went only twice. Next time I go I get a free pita!! fist bump!! The customer service was polite. Props to the pita family.  My son and I enjoyed it very much!!"}
{"text":"I live two blocks from this restaurant, and love the fact that they deliver! Vegas has very little option for food delivery unless you're willing to settle for pizza or chinese.......not the healthiest choices. Pita pit is amazing because it is so diverse, offering a ton of ways to customize your pita, and it's healthy and satisfying."}
{"text":"Great food for the cost. The ingredients are always fresh. The staff is very friendly. Definitely recommended for a quick meal"}
{"text":"Pita Pit. How about that. This place has been here this whole time huh? Yes, that's what I said to my buddy who could not believe I lived here so long without dropping in here yet. Apparently this is that place to be when you've just wrapped up quite the lavish drink sesh in uptown. Sorry guys, guess I'm overlooking this when I put on those beer goggles and stumble into Fuel a couple doors down.  NONETHELESS this place is pretty fantastic. I love the cuisine. The food quality is damn good- well seasoned meats, fresh ingredients, and made to order.  Healthy eating is always good, but if you don't want to go full-on Atkins, you can get a Philly steak. Done. Seems to be something for everyone........ in the form of pitas.   I find the staff very friendly and FAST. From the time we placed the order, to when we were seated and eating, must've only been 2.5mins. Exceptional service."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat off-campus. Pita pit satisfies all my criteria for eating on a work day: quick, affordable, and delicious. I like that I can get meat and salad rolled into one pita, for five to seven dollars, which saves me time and money.  So far, I've had the \"meat the day\" breakfast pita which comes with Italian sausage, bacon, and eggs. It's hearty, tasty, and you can get it whenever. You can then get lettuce, spinach, mushrooms, and onions - in other words, a breakfast salad rolled into something better than a tortilla. This whole process takes less than five minutes and I've never had to wait in line too long so far.  I had their local pita, chicken chipotle, which was delicious. The other nice thing is there's no extra charge for guacamole, and with sour cream, this thing was out of control. They do have an excellent selection of sauces, so you can find anything that fits your fancy.   I've been in there everyday this week and if they had fresh juice, I'd have to put in a request to have my office located here."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at all the reviews that mention friendly service. I thought the two employees here to be quite rude and very impatient. It was my 2nd time here and I still didn't really know how to order and didn't really understand what they were asking me. I explained this and they got really snippy and arrogant when I asked follow up questions. I called the girl out for this and she got more rude. It was really uncomfortable. I would have just cancelled my order but I had already paid and I felt so uncomfortable that I just wanted to leave. I figured a refund would lead to a bigger commotion. I can only assume this is because they are located across the street from a high school and maybe used to serving a different demographic (so they work quick and fast like robots) but at 5;45pm on a weeknight there was only one other customer so I couldn't understand their attitude. Eye contact and a smile would have gone a long way. I felt unwelcome and like PitaPit doesn't care if they get my business. The food was pretty good. A little pricy but a nice change from Subway and McDonald's. However the rude service left me with such a negative feeling about this place that I don't plan on returning for awhile."}
{"text":"Jeesh, does anywhere deliver after 9p on a Saturday night in Las Vegas? I was visiting a girlfriend, we didn't want pizza or Chinese, so our options were limited. We Yelp-ed and finally stumbled upon the Pita Pit at 9:15. The website said that they delivered until 10p, so we thought we were all set.  Ordering online was a real process- it seems as though they have a few different websites and not all of them lead to online orders. After 10 very frustrating minutes trying to navigate them online, we finally called the store, who told us that they didn't take telephone orders, only online ones.   Ok, back to the website! We FINALLY got to the right one, placed our order, entered all of the information, and clicked \"complete my order\" at 9:38, only to get an error message saying that they were no longer taking orders for delivery. What?!?! It isn't 10pm yet!!  We called Pita Pit and a very nice employee named Paul apologized for the glitch and said that was an issue that someone else had reported- the website cutting off orders before 10p. He took our order over the telephone and said that he would make sure we got our food and look into the website issue.  Our order arrived shortly, and we were starving. My friend got the Chicken Slouvakki (sp), and I got the Chicken Crave. We also got an order of pita and hummus to share. The pita was just average. Barely warm and kind of tough. The worst for me was my Chicken Crave. It was FULL of onions- the first bite I took was ALL onion! I definitely didn't expect that. I ended up having to unwrap it and try to pick out some of the onions because they were so overwhelming. It also didn't have much sauce on it, so it was a bit dry.  Between the headache ordering and the extra oniony pita.. I don't know if I'm inclined to try Pita Pit again."}
{"text":"I went in before a concert at the Kent Stage.  The staff was fine but the gyro I had was tasteless and the place was pretty dirty.  Pass."}
{"text":"Awesome way to end a night of drinking - filling, just greasy enough and decently cheap.  They also offer delivery and a number of healtier options that make it a good choice for a normal dinner as well...  Also, the pita chips and babaganoush are amazing."}
{"text":"The food is always good, but my delivery order has been 30 minutes late 2/3 times. This is so unacceptable; they need a better system."}
{"text":"Wow! Expensive! Pita only for $7.80 and now I have to stop on way home to get something else to eat. Hate to see what bill would have been with chips and drink. Five bite pita for $7.80? Naw, not again. Now I'm thirsty and hungry. Premium beef? No."}
{"text":"A delicious place with good, healthy food. The folks working there are very helpful and friendly. My wife and I love this place!"}
{"text":"The concept is simple.  Pita's stuffed with items of your choosing.  Think Subway, but with a middle eastern flare."}
{"text":"Loved this place when I lived in Charlotte. This is the after hours spot in Downtown Charlotte. Located in the center of all the clubs, also a staple of all the local bankers at lunch time. The grilled chicken pita is delicious. They have a list of condiments and veggies you can add on. Great hummus and pretty good tzatziki sauce. The portions are extremely generous. Definitely bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"This is a great little sandwich and salad store all rolled into one.  (Pun intended.)  You can get a meat or vegetarian sandwich and all the salad fixings; all rolled into white or wheat pita or as huge filling salad.  The ingredients are fresh, the staff friendly and they have a lot of good veggies to choose from.  I get mine to go, but you can sit at one of their small number of tables if you like.  And a plus, I can always get extra napkins of a fresh baked cookie."}
{"text":"Great hummus and falafel veggie pitas!! The food is awesome and ingredients tasted fresh. We ordered ahead of time and picked up  so can't comment about the service but the one thing that struck me was the person who checked out didn't make eye contact or smile. Someone else behind the counter did say have a nice day though, so it's not all bad. I would go back for the food though."}
{"text":"I had been warned before going in that you need to know what you want before you order, so I did, or so I thought.  The special's board had a \"local favorite\" without a description so I asked the guy at the register \"What's the Aloha\".. He yelled back, Ham, pineapple, chicken, teriyaki sauce. Sounded good.  So then I sort of wandered along the counter not having any idea where my order would turn up.  I was then asked by one counter person, what my order was and white or wheat (She had to repeat herself twice because as one reviewer said- it was LOUD.)  I told her my order, then the next guy asked me what I ordered. Again, the Aloha.  He wanted to know what toppings I wanted.  I had no idea- the sandwich already sounded fairly complete already.  Anyway after yelling back and forth I came up with a couple of toppings, but wait- not done yet.  The THIRD person asked (yelled) at me what was my order.  Again, the Aloha. So what sauce did I want.  Besides teriyaki?  She didn't answer just put teriyaki on it.    We then sat to eat and more yelling ensued. In short I would rate the food as 4+ but the experience was no higher than a 2.  Loud, crowded, strange lay-out, poor communication from the staff.   But if you know what you want, and aren't eating there, you'll probably enjoy it."}
{"text":"Today was my first time there and definitely last time.   Employees are dirty when cook food on flat top. Flat top was dirty and look disgusting. They claim not to have food contamination BUT I was standing while they were making my food. After two attempts of making food correctly, I had to cancel order because of food contamination.   Employees were star arguing with me loudly In Front of other customers. Took my money and walked out. NEVER going back to this store. Worse customer service ever.  For obvious reason shared this story with at least 8-10 people  at work and surprisingly most of them who went there had similar concerns. Go figure"}
{"text":"Extremely fast and friendly service.  I've been stopping by almost daily since being assigned to work nearby, and the staff knew me by my third visit.  I met the owners one day, and they were extremely courteous to ensure that my food requests were tailored to properly.  The owners also mentioned that Pita Pit is rolling out more protocols to ensure food handling is done properly for the different food diets and requirements.  I can not recommend this place enough.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"YOU GUYS - whenever I am on Mill Ave. I absolutely have to stop into Pita Pit to relive my college glory days in San Diego! I'm pretty sure that I ate there at LEAST 5 times a week in college {during the day and after a night at the frat parties combined}. Hey, at least it was healthier than a burrito, right?! I always got the exact same thing. No, not the Chicken Caesar like everyone else! I have my own concoction. The service at this Tempe PP is SO friendly and they always whip up exactly what i'm craving!  My Order:  White pita, chicken, feta, shredded lettuce, olives, tomatoes, cucumber, banana peppers, artichokes, onions, and LOADS of Tzatziki sauce {this is the key...load it on baby!}.   I guess you can say it is basically a Greek inspired pita but I just love it so much! Thank you for making all of my PP dreams come true, Mill Ave.!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the staff bent over backwards to accommodate us. My husband and I ordered meat free meals and without being prompted to the young man taking care of us changed his gloves and offered to microwave my falafel and my husbands black bean patty so that they wouldn't come in contact with any meat or dairy. It's so difficult to go out to eat as a vegan, I'm happy to say I have a new go to place with such good food."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I always get the chicken slavoki(?). I love it! I also have an account with pita pit which means that I get enough points for a free pita. So far I've gotten 2 free pitas from 6 visits. Woohoo."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite quick bite joint and it certainly beats fast food! It's much different than any pita place I've been to before.. It's Subway style but with pitas.. So you can choose what goes in your pita as you move down the line. There's plenty of options so if you're a returning customer like me it doesn't get old. Its made to order so always fresh. They frequently have coupons in the mail offers, so check it out and give them a try!! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Staff is awful. One called his coworker a bitch to us, we couldn't believe it. Contacted management, and they basically told us off. They also work slower than molasses. Will NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"As I've mentioned in other reviews...  I am picky as hell when it comes to eating.  There aren't many things I like and once I hit upon things I do like I will happily eat them over and over and over ...  much to the dismay of my husband.  So we're currently living on the sah'side right around the corner from this place.  We've been here maybe 3 weeks...  eaten here 5 or 6 times.  I love the hummus with tzitziki (sp) sauce and cucumbers on whole wheat pita.  Probably not the most normal combination but I am weird that way and could eat this every night for the rest of my life.  The turkey is also really, really good.  They serve it hot and it tastes just like thanksgiving turkey, not lunch meat.  Yummy!  Pitas are always nice and squishy.  I hate hard pitas.  It's kinda like subway but different enough that it's a nice change of pace.  The only thing I don't like about it - and the reason my husband won't actually consent to eat there every night - is they have no kid's menu.  There is a sign inside that says \"Ask about our kid's menu!\" but when we asked, the guy looked at us blankly and said \"Just order something with cheese, or something.\"  The problem with this is my son has a habit of eating the inside of his sandwich and that's all.  So paying full price for a sandwich he only eats the inside of doesn't sit well with me.  If your kid actually eats the sandwich it's not a big deal.  The place isn't exactly kid-unfriendly, it's just not budget friendly if your kid won't eat it all.    Love this place!"}
{"text":"OMGOMGOMG!!! I love Pita Pit! They started in Canada back in '97 and I used to go there all the time after clubbin' when I lived in Toronto, during college. I can't believe we just got our first one here in Vegas.... and its a 5 min. walk from my work. GOOD JOB putting it next to the university to feed those hungry students. now can you put another location on Fremont street where its hard to get a healthy bite to eat?   The pita bread is awesome, thin but soft and chewy, there are 3 times as many toppings to choose from compared to subway, and none of them except for cheese and meat cost extra!  Im excited to try all the breakfast pitas, that's next. I good one of my co-workers there this afternoon and she LOVED it. She and I are going back tomorrow!  Its perfect for those trying to eat healthy, lots of veggies to choose from, not as much bread as a sub, and great Vegetarian/Vegan options.  Even though I'm not a vegan I like to get the falafal pita, it was my long time favorite back home. they stuff that thing with falafal, I honestly didn't expect that much food in it.  UPDATE: You don't get all the veggie fixin's with the breakfast pitas! be warned so to not be dissapointed. if you really want guac an tomato and stuff with your eggs and bacon make sure to tell them at the register and pay a little extra."}
{"text":"Ok, if Subway is busy. Just too darn expensive for pitas!  I've been here a total of three times now, and each time I came away feeling like $8 (pita and a drink + tax) is too much for what you get. Yesterday was my last trip here. I had a babaganoush and my son had a hummus. There was NO WAY they spread more than 1.5oz. on each. Plus, the babaganoush had no distinguishing flavors of eggplant nor garlic, requirements of a good babaganoush. My 8yo son was starving after eating his hummus pita and asked for another. We decided to pickup some 'filler' at Subway.  On the up side, everything is fresh and the have a moderately good selection of sauces and extras.  If you do decide to go, go for some meat. At least you have a better chance of filling that growing tummy."}
{"text":"Pita Pit shits on all other franchise sub shops. I mainly eat salads not subs, and this is my favorite place to go for lunch in the area. The meat they use is high quality, and they grill it immediately before putting into a salad or pita. There are many toppings to choose from, and they are generous with portions. Here's what I usually get:  club (bacon, ham, turkey) spinach green pepper onion black olives pineapple  cucumber feta honey mustard  I love it. My coworkers and I go every Thursday because the lady who is working during lunch that day is very nice and makes the best pita/sald! Try this place out!"}
{"text":"I am a FAN FAN FAN! its a PITA cake going here and getting some delicious food, see what i did there?  For starters, it is clean as a whistle in here which is VERY important for me. Clean place, clean space for cooking. Everything is out in the open and ready for you to see, try, hear, smell , whatever your senses can handle.  Its health conscious food, but obviously they have some unhealthy options. But all in all you get quite the bang for your buck.   I got a buffalo chicken pita, a regular size and it was enough for 2 meals. Seriously it was bigger than my head and they stuff those badboys to the brim. It was full of flavor, fresh chicken that i watched get grilled and all the addings i could ask for.  I want to give an honorable mention to the nice guy behind the counter, his name is Damian. He was SUPER friendly and helpful, he could see i was a newbie and let me explore the menu before placing my order. He even explained pita size and choices to me and basically walked me through the whole process. Thats customer service for ya!  Their menu is simple and straight to the point and thats what i loved most! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome healthier option for quick lunch!  Me:  Chicken Cesar Pita. Hubby: Chicken Buffalo Pita.   Make your choices between grilled veggies, raw selection, awesome sauce  choices.  Very staff at this location and it's cool that you can order on line as we can tell this small place would probably be crazy if real busy.  Pricier than any fast food $5 combo but again delicious and no guilt.   Shine On Pita Pit!"}
{"text":"This was the most flavorless pita I have ever had.  To top it off I asked for RED ONION and the person gave me ROASTED RED PEPPERS.  I even asked again if he added onion and he said yes.  Uh boy...$10 later and I didn't even eat 1/2 of it.  Too expensive to waste my money on tire tread gyro sandwiches."}
{"text":"It's like the Subway of pitas, what's not to like? I came in on a Friday evening and it was dead.  But the staff were very helpful and my chicken souvlaki pita was delicious. Also a plus for being super easy and non-messy eating in the car"}
{"text":"Driving down W 210, I saw the Pita Pit sign and immediately craved a Gyro. I pulled in and went inside and, mouth watering, ordered a gyro. After paying, moved down the counter to pickup my order.  I was greeted by a genial young man who wanted to know \"what I wanted on it?\" I replied that I just wanted the gyro, nothing special. It was immediately obvious that he had no idea what goes on a gyro (lettuce, onion, tomato, gyro meat and tahini sauce, Classic gyro). He ended up handing it off to someone else who asked me the same question. I told her the same thing and she gave me \"the look\" at which time I should have asked for my money back and left, but I had my heart set on that gyro. She then proceeded to toss a bunch of diced cucumber into the pita, followed by black olives a sprinkling of diced tomato and a dollop of tahini sauce.  As she was finishing up, I asked if she had put onion and tomato in and she said she had. I'd seen the look, so I didn't argue the point, just took my pseudo-gyro and left.  It's obvious this place is built on the Subway model, which I'm no fan of -- you see a commercial for a tasty-looking sub, go in and order it and are then asked to recite the ingredients. When you say you just want what was on the sandwich in the \"Chipoltle Chicken commercial\", the woman behind the counter says, \"I didn't see it. What's on it? If I wanted to make the sandwich, I'd apply for a job there so I could frustrate thousands.  Anyway, the Pita Pit is no longer on my list of \"I should try that place\". I will give the wrap place next door a try, though."}
{"text":"I have always found the staff very helpful and the food delicious!  I recommend the breakfast pitas, they are explosively large but will keep you full all day long!  Pass on the smoothies...they are the boxed kind."}
{"text":"Pita Pit is a nice little place on Kennedy and progress.  You can find it right beside the Gas Station near Kennedy Commons.  Pita Pit is not a fancy establishment with great decor or anything, but the quality of the ingredients and preparation are top of the line.    Personally when I eat Fast Food, I like the preparation process, for example, Subway, Harvey's Etc.    In short, Pita Pit is a great, affordable place to grab a nice healthy lunch or dinner.  You get the customization options to make your wrap taste the way you want it.    All in all I give this place a good recommendation.  You can sit in and eat late at night, or you can take your pita to go, either way, you'll love this place."}
{"text":"BEST FOOD!!! EVER!!!   Excellent service !!!  Delicious fooodddd!!! Great prices!!!  My boyfriend Ryan got   \"the local\" it's buffalo chicken! And I got regular chicken pita with all the fixings and I tried a side of there cucumber sauce and they have this secret spicy vinaigrette ! Yumy!!  Try it!!!!    I would work there just to eat all the time Hahah !!"}
{"text":"SO good!!  Tonight was my second time in Pita Pit & I'm still wondering why I waited so long to come here! The food is fresh, amazing, & served just right. Unique and cool style. There are so many delicious options, it could be hard to pick! Richard makes the place even better with his personable but chill way. And he had good recommendations, which is nice with so many choices. I'd come back for the good company! Five stars."}
{"text":"Defiantly really yummy way better than subway and way more options!! I ordered delivery and they messed up my order, I called and they said they would credit it idk how, so hopefully it will be credited. I will for sure eat there again !! Just wish they had artichokes and sprouts & they would be solid"}
{"text":"This place makes me feel like it's a subway shop in style. You pick a meat or veggie item & either white or wheat pita. They heat the item up & you pick what veggies/toppings you want. Avocado & hummus are included too if you want. Plenty of dressings too.  Once you pick everything they assemble it inside the pita into a burrito style meal.  I got the black bean patty in mine. It was good but not great. Next time i will try the falafel.  Plenty of vegetarian/vegan options. But they also have a variety of meats."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and there are so many choices! Mango tango smoothie was perfect  will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Housed in my favorite plaza, Pita Pit sits in the building with Café Rio. Come here for a small, fresh lunch, but don't come starving (unless you're ready to spend). It appears to be vegetarian/vegan friendly. I just wanted fresh veggies. The décor is an annoying whimsical cartoon of the ingredients, but the staff ran it like a mom and pop. By that I mean it's a little disorganized and left me feeling questionable. Despite that I enjoyed my food. I ordered the BLT. They asked me what I wanted in it. The menu says what is in it. So I said, \"everything.\" No, you have to still go through and say what you want (like Zaba's). That's cool in that you can get extra stuff without paying extra. It's weird because it's bacon, lettuce, tomato and mayo. They cooked the bacon in front of me (neato). The bacon was not like thick, pepper dream-bacon. It was thin and crispy, but it was good. When she was stuffing my whole wheat pita though I felt like she wasn't putting enough greens in there. Regretfully, I didn't say anything. My lover ordered chicken souvlaki salad. It too did not have enough greens. It was like when you open a bag of chips and it's just air and crumbs at the bottom. He really enjoyed the meat and the dressing (horseradish). But after spending about $20 I thought we would be full. If they changed the portions I'd be back because it tasted great."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Pita Pit is my Go-To lunch stop cuz it's fast and easy and soooooo delicious! They have healthy options and it's very filling! Mmm Mmm good!"}
{"text":"I went to Pita Pit for the first time using a Groupon deal.  Although I wasn't too impressed with the atmosphere (slightly unclean), I was quite surprised by the food itself which was quite tasty.  And that is even AFTER a 25 minute drive home before digging in!  I also thought the staff was very sociable and made a great recommendation for toppings on my Philly Cheese Steak pita (I know, I know...not the healthiest choice).  Groupon or no Groupon - I will be back!!"}
{"text":"After a morning spent thrifting at the Goodwill across the street with my mom, we were starved!  Pita Pit was nearby so we decided to give it a try.  We walked in totally lost but the staff were incredibly helpful and explained all of our options to us.  We thought it was super tasty and loved that you could create your own.  This was on a Friday around 1 and it wasn't crowded.  We sat and ate our meals there which were standard tables, nothing fancy.  Super easy and quick, and we didn't feel bloated afterward.  Next time we go thrifting, we plan on stopping in!"}
{"text":"Me and my cousin were in the plaza and saw pita pit and thought we give it a try I ordered the dagwood and she ordered the philly steak the food was good  The lady there didn't seem to understand us very well   Overall everything was good will be back"}
{"text":"Kept forgetting to try this place and I am so happy we finally did! They list calories and have wheat and white pita. A ton of different options as well. So delicious and amazing! I can't wait to come back ."}
{"text":"Poor service, very disorganized. Asked for a pita with felafel, got very crushed felafel balls as they like to tighten down the insides. Gave me the wrong size. I'll go back in 6 months."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch.  The food is sooo yummy and prepared very quickly.  It's a nice cheap and healthy lunch option downtown.  My only complaint is that the dining room tends to be pretty messy - I would recommend taking your food to go."}
{"text":"I love pitas, hummus and falafels. As such, when I saw a coupon for the Pita Pit in the UNLV coupon booklet (love that thing), I decided it was high time I checked them out.   I'm very happy that I did, as they have an amazing selection of vegetarian options. The first time I went there I had a pita with falafels, hummus, spinach and feta. Delicious! The second time was in the morning, so I had the Morning Glory sans green peppers and with feta (what can I say, I love goat cheese). It was tasty, and the tomatoes were perfectly grilled."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Pita Pit location for about a year, almost at least once a week. I have always loved the fact that you can choose what you want on your Pita sandwich. Yesterday my co-worker and I went there and they had new staff, a new layout and new menu. We didn't think anything of it, but after ordering our pitas, we filled our sodas and they made our pitas without even asking us what we wanted on them, or if we wanted to substitute anything. Which we did want to. Very disappointing this trip. When my co-worker said that she didn't like feta cheese, the employee just scooped off a handful leaving a good amount on the Pita. My Pita has spinach, which I prefer lettuce, but it was already made. And she was heavy handed on the siracha, so that's all I tasted. Bummer, we did not care for the new changes."}
{"text":"Fresh, fast Mediterranean style food. I can't say I'd choose this spot over table service, but it seems good enough for a quick stop or a lunch. You tell them what you want, double meat? There's an option for that, top it with hummus, tatziki, jalapeños, peprocini, cucumber and more. They cater too. I'd stop in again if I lived or worked in the area :-)  Happy yelping! ... Gilbert, Mesa, or wherever I am. ;-)"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for awhile but never really had the chance. Usually I'm in uptown to have dinner with my wife but yesterday I had the day off, wife was working, and I was with my 2 year old daughter. We wanted to have a nice afternoon and she had asked me if we can go on a choo choo. Took the light rail in from Tyvola and walked to the Pita Pit. Had the Falafel. First question they asked me was if I wanted it grilled or microwaved which I thought was weird. I said \"grilled\". The combo was add a soda and a bag of chips. Total came out to around $9 which I thought was way pricey but was good. Would have felt better if for the price I would have had fries instead of Lays or Doritos. Most Falafel places I am used to in Major cities are priced around $5 for Falafel + soda. It did taste great though. Dissapointed they don't have french fries."}
{"text":"the only reason i speak of the mistake  is to give the praise to the food and the team , thank you , there was a forgotten peta and humas , a bit of time later they had upgrade to one more great pita. So i must say the food is very good and the service is 100% in my book"}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Matter of fact, disappointed slightly with the Pita,, I chose wheat, and it was tearing as he put the wrap together, needless to say it didn't hold up while eating it and so really kind of bummed about that. The Gyro meat is also lacking and nowhere near the flavor and taste that I am used to from most other places. Price is out there too. $7.99 for a wrap that had bland taste, nothing special toppings, and wrap that fell apart while eating it? Not going back. I will say  that the person behind the counter was pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"I'm writing this as I'm dining in. Had Pita Pit a few years ago and remember it was awesome. Exited to try it again!   Dude at the counter was friendly.  The whole place is very clean, as well as the bathroom.  Got drinks on tap from that Coke machine that has a ton of drinks. Waited between 5 and 10 mins to get my Pita.   I ordered the Philly Pita which wasn't bad.  I think I would have enjoyed a more traditional chicken Pita. It had onions, tomatoes, lettuce, and whatever they traditionally put in this item. There was horse radish sauce too which was good to give it a bit more flavor.  Overall, I was however a little underwhelmed with the lettuce/meat ratio as a bit more meat would have been nice.  You can order extra meat though.  It was tightly wrapped like a burrito in a nice, soft and tasty Pita bread.  It wasn't messy at all and easy to eat.  I happened to be there during mid/late afternoon and it was happy hour so the Pita was only $5, so I like that. Also, most menu items appeared to be between 200 and 400 some calories which seems like a healthy amount of calories.  If you're looking for a quick bite to eat that's not gonna pile on calories, give it a try!"}
{"text":"I've been here a quite a few times because it's a easy place to get a good lunch.  I always get the spicy black bean pita with all the veggies! But the last time I was here they literally couldn't roll my pita up and ripped a whole hole in the pita and then wrapped it with a another pita. Totally did not want the extra carbs and calories for 2 pitas in that ....... I was just surprised since I always get the same thing and no one ever has trouble rolling it or let alone ripped the whole thing . But it was still good just too much pita bread for me this time . Hopefully it doesn't break the next time !"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken caesar pita on the eat24hours.com app. I get a call from a nice guy telling me they don't have any plain chicken breast so I opted for a differently spiced one. I got my food and first of all, the soda choice I made vs what I got was incorrect. While it was close, it was wrong but I can look past that. What I CAN'T look past is the fact that the chicken isn't chicken at all. It was all rubbery/fatty pieces and I ended up picking ALL the chicken OFF the pita and just eating the pita bread with the bacon. It was pretty gross, to be honest."}
{"text":"Trisha was outstanding today, was visiting friend at hospital across street and she went out of her way to do some extra stuff for me, thanks Trisha!!"}
{"text":"Came in yesterday for some lunch to take to the park. The two gentlemen working at the counter didn't have any idea what they were doing. Not only did it take more than 20 minutes to make two chicken Caesar Pita is, but they forgot the goddamn Caesar dressing! When we realize that we were already too far out and had to stop at the grocery store and buy a bottle of Caesar... I would never go to this location again."}
{"text":"It's funny another reviewer related it to Subway which is also how I describe it to others.  I'm inclined to like it more than Subway as the vegetarian options for protein and vegetables are amazing. It has a lot of choices from jalapenos to onions to alfalfa sprouts. It's also open late past bar time and has a pretty comfortable atmosphere inside with TV's and a friendly staff.   I'd recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"I have been to Pita Pit's from Ottawa-Kingston and have seen the good, bad and ugly.  Whilst pursuing my academic dreams the Pita may well have been the only source of vegetable I consumed.  I'm talking of the toppings for those that think I may be losing it and that I actually may be suggesting that a pita in itself could qualify as a vegetable source.  All joking aside I have been more than impressed with the quality and service at the Adelaide location, because as those of you who eat or have eaten a lot at PP know all locations are not created equal.  In fact I find it hard to think of a franchise that embraces such disparity across locations to a greater degree then PP.  However I have always felt that the Adelaide locale is home.  It was the first PP I frequented after awkward nights out in the club district, and I knew that if all else failed I had my double chicken pita with extra mayo and hot peppers to seek solace in.  It was during these formative years that I came to truly love the pita and embrace all that it was and is.  it was one drunken revelation I had that would forever seal my attachment to the beautiful pita, and I remember it clearly.  I was sitting on the sidewalk in front of PP when it suddenly hit me.  I was getting everything I needed in a meal from this pita.  It gave me sustenance and strength and it tasted incredible.  I couldn't believe that I had missed this observation previously and at that moment decided to blurt out my undying love for all things pita.  It was also this moment that I'm sure I will undoubtedly be sharing with a psychiatrist in the not so distant future.  I should note that the Adelaide PP is super generous with toppings, specifically cheese.  I have been to many a PP that will not give me both cheddar and feta.  Here this has never been a problem.  When I asked gingerly if this could be accommodated before I was in the know I was almost laughed at, and watched in awe as the generous pita man loaded me up with both."}
{"text":"HUGE salads.  You can have your pita without the bread and eat it too!  The roast beef here is GREAT.   I came in at lunch and it took forever to get thru the line. Order was taken quickly, but then to actually get to my order took like 15 minutes, and by then she had forgotten what I ordered.  But... the salad I got was worth it."}
{"text":"It's the subway of wraps. Fresh veggies, good choices. Nice menu selection. Location isn't too obscure. I pass the location daily and finally stopped.  I had south west chicken from the sauce to meat and veggies it was good.  Subway will offer more your money but Pita Pit to me was more favourful."}
{"text":"I just can't believe I have yet to review this place. This most glorious of all glorious places.  My first visit to Pita Pit was to the Southside Works location. I fell in love with the food instantly, though there was something about the service at that location that I didn't completely love.  For months I would occasionally think of the Downtown location.  Seemed so FAR.  Working in the Cultural District, a walk to that section of Smithfield just seemed so daunting.  Really?  I'll walk the 3 miles to work, but won't walk a few blocks?  I'm an idiot; but an idiot no more!    The service at this location is extraordinary. Of course I have my favorite pita artists, but they're all pretty talented.  I always order the same: Garden Pita with everything...and I mean everything.  Romaine, spinach, jalapenos, sprouts mushrooms, olives, PINEAPPLE, pickles, banana peppers, roasted red peppers, green peppers, onions (unless it's date night), just...everything (except for cheese -  I'm such a liar).  Top it off with a little dijon and you've got your own little piece of Pita perfection for $6 and 200 calories - win.  They have a decent rewards program too, so pick up a PIT Card while you're at it."}
{"text":"I love this place! I probably eat here twice a week, seven days a week if I could! The food here is always fresh. The restaurant is always clean. Staff is very friendly. Also I love having a healthy food option that I can get in and out of for a decent price!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for fast, fresh food.  It is one of my regular hangouts.  I take friends and family to eat here because it's quick, casual, friendly and healthy.  The staff is friendly, polite and accommodating.  I love that they are open late (10PM) because I can still pick up a healthy meal on my way home after working late.  They have a great rewards program for your mobile phone and they often give away coupons.  It's a great dining experience.   Please dine here if you like positive experiences."}
{"text":"Didn't like this place at all. Portions too expensive and one of my workmates said that his pita (cost him $7) felt more like a McDonalds snack wrap than a full sized sandwich. He got the buffalo chicken pita. I got the babaghannoush one. The menu said that it has eggplant. Now I KNOW that babaghannoush *contains* pureed eggplant but the way it was written led me to believe that there was going to be some fried eggplant or something in it. No such luck. Next, I'm called over with \"Sir, I can help you over here\" as though I hadn't given my order yet. My bad, I didn't realise that next up it was Subway time. Agnieszka the eastern bloc ESL preparer asks me \"white or wheat?\" and then dollops some babaghannoush on the pita and asks if I want \"side items\". I asked for some mushrooms and onions. Then she tucks it together and I'm like - oh, wait, that's ALL I'm getting? Cold, too. No toasting option. Basically six bucks for a snack wrap, and both of us were still hungry after. Avoid this place. If you ever want a decent pita meal, you cannot go wrong with \"The Greek Wraps\" (http://www.yelp.com/biz/greek-wraps-peoria) - get a chicken shawarma wrap with some dolmas and falafels - badaBING! (throws fist in the air emphatically) And if you want Subway style, just go to any given Mr Goodcents and get a whole original. This place is a poor man's mix of both."}
{"text":"While I am all for having healthy and affordable lunch options Downtown I am not a pita person and thusly my attitude towards the Pita Pit is I could really take it our leave it. Why would a person who doesn't like Pitas go to a Pita pit, that remains a good question???   The ingredients are very fresh. In my mind they are burrowing the Subway assembly line idea but instead of bread they use pitas. I enjoy fresh veggies and fast service but would enjoy them more so at another restaurant where the pita doesn't come with.   I am giving four stars because they're doing what they're advertising which is putting things in a Pita and doing it with efficiency  too."}
{"text":"Love this place specially the chicken soulaki. They used to have buy 2 and get 1 free deal which is no longer available. I wish the owner reads this review and brings it back."}
{"text":"There's something very nostalgic about pita pit with me.  I first got introduced to fast food pitas when I was at university about 15 years ago and remember being in a dorm room and ordering a pita and having this guy on a bike deliver it to us (basically the green version of Skip The Dishes).  On a side note, I was in uni 15 years ago!!!! Crap! I'm old!!.    I digress, but I definitely like the options here better than Extreme Pita.  Extreme Pita caters to the more generic taste buds whereas pita pit has a fusion of Middle Eastern and North American.  I had the regular spicy black bean pita and it was great.  I got a bunch of grilled veggies on it, beans, a bunch of other greens with chipotle mayo and it filled my tummy without making me feeling bloated.  Verdict: if you are in the area, and want a quick, fast healthy meal (as opposed to Smoke's Poutine or Burger's Priest), this is a great choice."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken salad.  It had the strangest chicken I've ever seen, very gray & fatty.  I'm not even for certain if it really was chicken.  I only needed one bite to know it was not good quality. So much for getting my protein at lunch. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"I went to this Pita Pit when visiting family in Ohio and I was pleasantly surprised. I normally don't write reviews but because I finally went to a place that had speed, a friendly staff, and good food, I felt obligated to write a review....When I walked in the door, the place looked very clean. I noticed a long line so I was a little disappointed because I was in somewhat of a hurry. To my surprise, the line went very quickly because they were properly staffed. When I got to the front of the line, I asked the employee what his favorite pita was. He quickly said \"Chicken Crave\" with a smile. I chose his suggestion and my pita was constructed quickly but not sloppily. When I sat down to eat, the table and floor was clean. The food was excellent! Before I left I went to the restroom and the restroom was immaculately clean. To put the icing on the cake, on my way from the restroom to the exit door, the gentlemen who took my order spotted me and asked \"How did you like the Chicken Crave?\" (even though he was busy) Thank you Fairlawn Pita Pit for setting the standard for good food fast with great, clean service."}
{"text":"A healthy alternative to fast food they offer fresh poultry and various grilled meats with a variety of delicious veggies packed into a pita pocket.  The staff is generally polite unless you come in during their down time then they make it seem like you are inconveniencing them but the quality of the food overshadows the service, This place rocks!"}
{"text":"Never again!  This place was disgusting. I specifically stopped by here to get fresh and healthy food. By was I wrong because there is nothing fresh about this place. We ordered a chicken salad wrap, gyro wrap, falafel wrap, and hummus. All the meats and falafel a were pulled out of a freezer and cooked frozen. Was disgusting. Never going back. How do u advertise a place as fresh food when everything comes from a freezer I can make my own frozen food don't wanna pay for it"}
{"text":"Good place for a quick lunch. It was my first time here just a little before the lunch rush. I wasn't sure what to order so just went with the chicken Caesar pita. It's pretty much the same set up as a subway just with 'fresher' ingredients and instead of sandwich bread, they fill up your pita pocket bread with additional ingredients.   They charge extra for certain ingredients. You can either choose the hummus or the cheese, otherwise you have to pay extra to get both.   I loaded up my pita with hummus, spinach, peppercinis, jalapenos and olives.   It was pretty tasty. Very filling too!  I'd go back if I was in a hurry!"}
{"text":"Just your run of the mill pita pit, Always liked to eat here when I first came across the chain in Bozeman, MT.  I ordered the Chicken Crave, cooked up real well.  Attendant was alright, the Soda machine is the best though!"}
{"text":"You would think being a new business you would get great customer service. Not here. 6 people behind the counter doing nothing.  The manager gets irritated when you ask a question.  Working with the general public is probably not ideal for him. The food is overpriced for what you get. Barely any meat. Mostly fillers. One positive is they have a great fountain drink machine."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited when I saw a Pita Pit in the parking lot on Power and Ray. I used to go to the one on mill during my ASU days, so I was all but forced by my inner will to forego Chipotle for Pita Pit.  Maybe it was because it's Labor Day, but the lights were super dim, the two girls were sitting down eating, and if I didn't know better, the place looked closed.  The food was okay. It was pre cooked meat. The girl didn't know how to make my sandwich, I had to tell her what goes on it. I just don't remember the one on Mill being this bad...  In general, I may give it another shot, but I won't skip my Chipotle fix again."}
{"text":"The fam and I needed a quick bite after 12 pm on a Thursday, but did not want the usual fast food. We spotted Pita Pit at the front side of Antiquity Point shopping center. We headed in that direction and parked on the street.   Two of the staff members welcomed us as soon as we entered. The store is small, but had ample seating. Looked clean. They had a few diners, but the place wasn't busy. There was no line. We paused to take a look at the menu and one of the staff members asked if we had been there before. We said it was our first time. One of the guys proceeded to explain the menu and ordering process. They cook your choice of protein on the grill, place it in a pita, then add your preferred toppings. Easy. After a few minutes, we decided on:  Chicken Souvlaki pita $7.19 Falafel pita $6.90 Kids pita $3.79 Chips $1.29 Drinks $2.29  When I ordered the chicken souvlaki, the same guy who explained the ordering process informed me that they use dark meat and asked if I was okay with that. I was. I appreciated his honesty because the type of meat used is not stated on the menu, just the ingredients. He also asked whether I wanted white or wheat pita. He fired the chicken up in the grill, placed it on a pita then added spinach, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and hummus per my request. I thought it was delicious. The ingredients looked and tasted fresh. The only downside is the size. They roll the pita into a burrito comparable to the size to a small burrito, maybe even a kids burrito. I have a big appetite.   I asked the fam about their pitas and they both enjoyed theirs, too. I don't remember the exact kids pita my son ordered. It was either chicken or ham? Anyway, my guys devoured theirs in minutes and had no complaints. They're both honest if they don't like something. Or maybe we were all just really hungry.   The service was excellent. The staff was super friendly, helpful, and patient. We will return."}
{"text":"I was strolling down State St., a painful churning and grumbling in my stomach constantly reminding me of my pitiful human need for food. Left and right, a plethora of variegated neon signs assaulting my vision. One in particular, a sign of green and red, immediately hosts my mind with fond memories of my childhood, huddled around a noble fir on Christmas morn. My gullet slowly shifting from an insatiable lust for nourishment, to a comforting feeling of warmth and fuzziness; I inexorably drift towards this glowing enigma. Still drunk with youthful splendor, I stumble in a haze towards my new objective. I reach out my hand, desperately grasping towards the threshold. I am instantly shaken to my senses as my fingers wrap around the could metal handle of the entryway. I lurch forward with all of my might and it swings open with surprising ease. Stepping forward, I am immediately accosted with a circus of smells and delicious temptations, and am practically blinded by the immeasurable choices lying before me. My senses overwhelmed, I struggle to discern the true motives of whoever constructed this establishment. The only thing I know for certain, is the screaming pain and longing my stomach expresses towards the spread before me. And it is in this stupor, that a sharply dressed gentleman finds me; helpless and hungry. The young lad regards me inquisitively, and is even curious as to my motivations inside this establishment. It is at this moment that I realize, all at once, in a flash of sobering realization, that this stoic form before me has offered to build me and my aching belly a vessel in which to sate our hunger. I graciously accept his kind gesture, and proceed to point and grunt at the various offerings that strike my fancy. I am in awe at his practiced movements, and am brought close to tears at the beauty of his creation. And finally, when the masterpiece was deemed complete, it left his hands, and entered mine. He calls himself Dan. A name befitting such a handsome fellow. I thanked him for everything he had done for me, and gave him paper currency as a token of our newly found friendship. My hand now brandished with this amalgamation of flavor, I set out into the night, renewed and beaming with vigor."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Fair prices. Fun employees. Big Pita's. This is just the facts type post."}
{"text":"Rachel gives excellent customer service and always a pleasure to talk to she is very helpful. The food at pita pit is super delicious addiction plus it is healthy for you too. I would recommend pita pit and this location to anyone."}
{"text":"They're good. I like the prime rib but it seemed like every time I bit into it it was cartilage. But can still get good pitas and salads."}
{"text":"This place is very busy during weekday lunch, but worth the wait and the food and service is amazing! The \"Super Greek\" is my personal favorite!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here one Saturday afternoon before going to the Levine Museum of the New South.  We were hungry and we knew it was fast and relatively cheap.  The guy taking our order had an attitude.  He forgot to give my wife her drink cup and when she asked for it, he looked in the trash to see the ticket because he thought she was lying.  It was his fault too because she ordered a combo.  I got some flavorless dry grilled chicken thing.  Yes, the chicken is cooked on a grill, but it's more like reheated than cooked.  The veggies were sparse, as were the condiments, and they wanted to charge her an extra dollar just to put some hummus on her tuna pita.  The tuna pita was also very dry, as if it was straight from the can and drained with nothing added to it.  Now I know why this place is so popular with the drunk crowd - they are the only ones who could tolerate it.  But the owners even gouge them by charging them \"late night prices\" after 11pm.  I probably won't ever go back up here unless I find myself drunk - but I would just as soon it the nearby Fuel Pizza, and that's not saying much."}
{"text":"If your looking for a healthy alternative but still want to eat fast- this is the place to go! When I'm in a pinch and on my health kick- this is the place I go.   I'm a sucker for their buffalo chicken pita, it's so yummy. They have an array of toppings that include some pretty healthy options and the calories are listed for each topping as well. How helpful is that?  Tip: Try the dry seasonings! The chipotle mango and cajun are really good to add for a spice top up!"}
{"text":"It's currently 6:07 pm and I'm standing outside Pita Pit, the lights are on and the door is locked. The sign says they are open until 8 p.m... I just drove out of my way to come here and was definitely looking forward to a pita, but to my surprise now I'm just standing outside in the cold writing a Yelp instead of eating dinner. To top it off I tried giving the store a call and the mailbox is full. Extremely unprofessional, Pita Pit."}
{"text":"How can I summarize my review without writing a million words?  Let's just say that after my first visit and eating my first Chicken Souvlaki, I proceeded to have Pita Pit for lunch and dinner the following THREE DAYS. I became an addict *snap* just like that.  For extra details:  - My ultimate favorite is the Chicken Souvlaki. My second is the Chicken Crave. But with so many options, I always come up with new combinations that taste great!   - Great for salads too! Since the meat they use is well seasoned, tender, and cooked to perfection, your salad will always taste fantastic.  - Pita Card. Get one! You'll rack up points in no time and be able to redeem them for free pitas!! It also doubles as a gift card so you can load cash onto it!  - Delicious break from the crap at the UNLV student union! Cheaper than Cafe Rio!    GO! GO! GO!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff who will definitely help out and even provide suggestions for a first timer. Tons of free veggies to choose from and I enjoyed the option of pineapple as well. Even though you can order double meat for 2.25 more, I wish the regular portion was larger"}
{"text":"M and I are always looking for cheap, healthy and awesome downtown lunch spots and I have to say that Pita Pit is beating out everyone else in the area.  We go there so often that I am thinking of getting the Pita Pit logo tattooed on my arm.  I'll start a trend.  In fact, if you are reading this and thinking, \"I need to go there, now!\" - I'll likely be there with my salad.   Yes, I know, I get a salad at the Pita Pit.  This is in no way to downplay the awesomeness of the pitas.  They are totally amazing, but watching calories, they are unnecessary with all the fantastic toppings that I want to include in my salad.    I generally get the chicken souvlaki salad with spinach as my base, banana peppers, mushrooms, cucumbers (which have been looking a little worse for wear lately), black olives, feta cheese and the most delicious of all delicious dressings - creamy pesto!  It's like a pesto party for your mouth!  M always gets the cheese steak with peppers, onions and mushrooms all grilled up, some cheese and chipotle BBQ sauce.  All the produce, when it can be, is locally sourced which makes me incredibly happy and a little shocked that a little chain can do this, but the veggies are really crispy and delicious (except the cucumbers, seriously, my love, what's up with the cucumbers?).  Go!  Go now!  You'll love it!"}
{"text":"I love Pita Pit! I love their selection of pitas, toppings, and of course, the people that work there.   Ingredients are always fresh and I like that there are a lot of options; from the protein in the pita, to the type (whole wheat vs. white), toppings, sauces, and cheese. I've had pita here a number of times and have always enjoyed my food. I usually go for the spicy chicken pita. But everything is great.   People that work there are very friendly and are happy to strike a conversation with you while you wait for your pita to be made.   The place is clean and has ample seating inside and more than enough parking outside.   There are lots of deals and coupons too, so keep an eye out for them and you'll be in for a treat."}
{"text":"Fast service and flexible hours! The only reason it's 4/5 is because the quality of your food solely depends on who is making it. Usually, it's always good. However, there have been several times my order has been off when certain people are working."}
{"text":"Great late night spot. It open until 3 am. Quick to get food. The place can get a little messy at night though."}
{"text":"It is what it is. I am never disappointed, and never blown away. I have been to this location three or four times."}
{"text":"Customer service is friendly. I ordered the spicy black bean pita. I got to chose all of my fillings spinach, hummus, beans, peppers, etc... Great price, very delicious & very clean. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"love this place, its healthy. tastes great, and you have more selection to fill your pita with then subway. Staff are courteous, and restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Looking for something delicious and healthy to eat? This is your place! Just think Subway, but with a pita. Here's how it goes..  1. You go to the register and order the meat you like. They have lots of options, even vegetarian options. I've had the chicken souvlaki, which is Mediterranean seasoned chicken and falafel, which is ground chickpeas/spices rolled into fritters and deep fried. Both have been so flavorful.  2. Then you head to the vegetable station while your meat cooks. You have the option of a wheat or white pita. They pack your pita full with whatever veggies and sauce you like.  3. Once the meat is cooked, they roll it all up and you're done!!   The employees are super nice and help you if you're undecided or if you're new to the place. They have a rewards card where it's a point for every dollar you spend. If you register the card online, you get 45 extra bonus points! Obviously, you redeem your points for food. You get fresh and healthy food for a great price. I'm definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"Pita Pit is delicious and healthy if you want, all at the same time! Hummus? YES PLEASE! A bit overpriced for what you get, but DELICIOUS. I will be back. Again and again."}
{"text":"Long awaited but now open in Cornelius  The young lady who styles my hair (what little is left) is a Pita Pit fan and was excited when this location was announced months ago. When she last cut my hair two weeks ago, she told me the were opening the following week and she could not wait to go. Turns out it was  a little later than that but they did open this past Monday.  After a busy day, I had a couple more places to go in Mooresville this evening but decided to try them out and grab a light dinner.  The place is tastefully designed with wrought iron tables and chairs outside which made for very pleasant outside dining.  Walked up to the counter and surveyed the menu and decided on the Small Buffalo Chicken Pita. The young man who took my order has been well trained. Not only did he take my order but in the process talked me into upgrading to the combo and made sure I had a loyalty card which I could active later. This is the type employee that owners like to have.  The owner Todd was walking around the room introducing himself, asking questions and making patrons feel at home and attached.. He asked if I lived in the area and I told him I live across the interstate on the lake and he told me he only lived 4 doors down.  When he was not engaging customers, he was busy making sure everything was running well and pitching in on cleaning.  Very good sign of a good restaurant.  The young man making my Pita was excellent making sure that I ended up with a good Pita. He would suggest topping such as Avocado which I did not see when made for an even better Pita.  Ended up with Pita made from Whole Wheat, Buffalo Chicken cooked on the flat top behind, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, avocado, buffalo sauce, ranch dressing etc.The station with the vegetable toppings was impressive and you could tell that everything was fresh.  Picked up my Pita along with a bag of Chips ( I could have gotten a cookie) and a drink and went outside to one of the tables and had a nice quite meal.  As far as the Pita, it was excellent. Nice and hot, well made, great flavor and you could taste the fact that all of the topping were fresh.  This place is going to be a keeper.  Great flavorful fresh food, well managed with motivated employees and a pleasant atmossphere"}
{"text":"I love their falafel!  Not only is the staff attentive and friendly, the veggies are always fresh, they run great specials AND they deliver if you're within 5 miles.  I'd share a pic of my delicious pita but it's gone!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Fresh ingredients.  We will keep coming back.  Thanks for opening this location."}
{"text":"It was eh. I got the black bean pita and it wasn't that great. My black bean patty was being cooked touching chicken. I don't think I'll go back again."}
{"text":"Pita and smoothie. More healthy than many other fast food chains."}
{"text":"Super excited to have a Pita Pit in the Lake Norman area!   The food is amazing and there are several healthy options.  It is new so they are still ironing out a few kinks, but I can deal with anything for those delicious Pita's!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, taste very fresh the service is even better, friendly faces.  Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Greek food has a special place in my heart. This place had some of the gratifying bittles despite it being fast food. We found it by accident when we were planning on eating at the fantastic Greek restaurant Stefano's in the same shopping center. We were saddened when we found out that Stefano's is closed on Sunday but this was definitely the next best thing.  I wavered between 3 & 4 stars on this one. Let's start with the positives: fresh ingredients,  speedy service. Negatives: only 1 worker on weekends, the food was good but not great. I would recommend this place if you are craving a gyro and need something quick. Even with only 1 worker she was very fast and very courteous. If there was some hummus not just chips to go with this then I would have probably given them a solid 4."}
{"text":"Ewww.  This place was just gross.  Basically it's just a Subway but with pita bread.  First, the pita bread is thin and gummy - it's more of a soggy tortilla than a pita.  I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki fork style which means essentially over lettuce.  I ordered first so he put my chicken on the grill.  My daughters each ordered pitas - my first daughter ordered the BLT pita and my other daughter ordered a gyro pita.  He asked my daughter who ordered the BLT \"what else\" she wanted in her pita so she assumed in addition to the bacon, lettuce and tomato.  She asked for mushrooms and taziki.  My daughter who ordered the gyro asked for a few veggies.  So, he makes the BLT and hands it to my daughter and then asks for it back.  He realizes he put the bacon for the BLT  in the pita that had the stuff for the gyro pita.  So, he opens the pita, scrapes out the bacon along with other veggies there were in it and stuffs it in the BLT pita.  He then puts the correct gyro meat in the gyro pita.  So my daughter who ordered the BLT essentially had bacon with veggies from the other pita and mushrooms (no lettuce or tomato) and my daughter with the gyro had half of her veggies scraped out to put in the other pita so her's was a small, sorry mess.   We were so confused by what he was doing, we didn't realize until after we left that the BLT never even got the lettuce and tomatoes.  So then,  AFTER he made their pitas, he finally goes back and gets the chicken off the grill for my salad.  By this time the chicken is dark brown, almost burnt and dry as can be.  All around just a gross experience.  And, what we did eat was tasteless.  The chicken had no seasoning, the bacon was chewy, the taziki was bland and tasted like it came out of a can.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place.  A quick healthier alternative than fast food.  pod was great and the employees were friendly!"}
{"text":"I work near by and the soda machine sometimes doesn't work but it's not pita pits fault it's coca cola so it's a inappropriate statement to state. Also the beer pong wasn't beer just water. It's mill a strip of bars! Anyway! I love eating there because it's healthy and quick! I love getting my onions cooked and my pita grilled because an employee offered me that service and I've been ordering it that way try going to jack n the box for that same service!! And by midnight is when all the drunks come in just a heads up!"}
{"text":"It's no Pita Jungle, but Pita Pit it's an okay place to grab a bite to eat in Happy Valley. Their selection is kind of small, but they let you create your pita (kind of like Subway). The service is really friendly, and generally they're not that busy (at least when I go about mid-day).   Other than letting you customize your pitas, there's not much else special about Pita Pit. Taste/Flavor factor is maybe a 2 out of 5 stars. Portions that I've gotten are fairly large, but I've heard of people not getting that big of a pita before.  So, Norterra...when are you going to get a Pita Jungle?! Seriously."}
{"text":"Lots of fresh-ish ingredients.  The help asks what you want then doesn't listen to your reply.  Balled up the sandwich for a football-like presentation.  Tastes like a giant wad of nothing.  No seasoning or uniqueness to anything.  Go somewhere else... anywhere else."}
{"text":"Have been going to pita pit for years. Great food chain. I always get the chicken Ceaser on a wheat pita. Food is always on point !"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome falafel! Great option for vegetarians. At around $8 not bad. Super fast to. I usually order ahead with grub hub and pick up 10-15 min later"}
{"text":"Not authentic Mediterranean/Middle-Eastern food, but pretty good nonetheless.The staff was also very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"If I could give it 10 stars I would.  Probably the most delicious sandwich I've ever had...ever!  The ingredients and pita were fresh and grilled to perfection.  I had the buffalo chicken and the server suggested pineapple in it...super good!  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here once and it wasn't good. It was a total waist of money. I will say that the portions were ver large."}
{"text":"This was very good! We were just shopping nearby and saw the Pita Pit. Great manager Richard and Esteban helped us behind the counter. Very fresh food. Healthy choice and delicious. We had the Tuscan Chicken, Buffalo Chicken and a build your own pita. I highly recommend this Pita Pit location!"}
{"text":"So amazing. Love the food here so healthy and easy. Total worth the reasonable prices. You pick a filling (chicken, steak, eggs and bacon etc) and get whatever veggies sauces etc you want. Like the amazing pita version of subway. Yum!"}
{"text":"Although this chain has been around awhile (I remember one opening in Austin back when I was in undergrad, so you know, a it was definitely at least a million years ago).  So being a newb, I asked a fair amount of questions as I was placing my order over the phone.  The lady on the end wasn't the friendliest, which fine, I get it, I should have determined what additional fillers I wanted and whether hummus was an additional side.  The falafel wrap was decent, although probably not the most delicious falafel ever.  I remember marveling at the massiveness of my wrap, but it was mostly lettuce.  Tahini sauce isn't available as a sauce (wtf?) so I had hummus added for a bit of creaminess.  I mean it was all right, served its purpose of offering a bit of stomach padding before a night of drinking, but I am not about to venture into another Pita Pit unless there's absolutely nothing else.  Also worth mentioning, the hummus and fried pita chips I ordered for others to much on - the chips were legit glistening with greasiness.  Ick.    Just FYI, Yelp and iPhone maps will lead you astray."}
{"text":"I love pita pit the food is always fresh and the size of the pita is huge, the dude below whom \"throws fist in the air emphatically\" must weigh around 350 or so or is just retarded to confuse the size of a large pita and a mcdonalds snack wrap. The pitas are big and worth the money then again u can get like 6 snack wraps for the same price but those are crap. Oh yeah and no toasting option . . . ? Who cares haha"}
{"text":"This place is great with good prices to boot.  Went in for a pick up of lamb wrap, garlic feta fries and grape leaves and everything was amazing.  Everything was hot, freshly prepaid and super tasty. My family on my mother's side is Greek and this is the closest thing I've had in vegas that can come close to home cooking."}
{"text":"Super bad. I ordered a pita salad and the lettuce that he put into the salad was clearly wilted and going bad. It was pretty much bright orange in color. The chicken was completely uncooked and rubbery, I had to stop eating to avoid getting sick. Also I was the only customer so I'm thinking the employee didn't really know how to cook.. at all. Wish I could get my money back."}
{"text":"Reliably good. Apparently they do late night crowd, but I've only done lunch. Loud place but good for takeout."}
{"text":"I grabbed lunch from Pita Pit on the way home from class today, seeing that it had recently opened. I was genuinely impressed! They had a large selection of interesting sounding pita fillings. Lots of vegetarian options, as well as many preparations of chicken, gyros, etc. What impressed me the most was the ample selection of vegetable toppings. Artichoke hearts, spinach, olives, and other toppings you would expect to pay extra for were included with your pita. The sauce selection was also very accommodating. They offer a quite generous student discount, and the employees were all pleasant. I did not expect it to stand out as much as it did, in terms of quality and taste, but I was surprised. Glad to have you in the neighborhood.  Pro-tip: grab a free chips+drink coupon from above the trash cans with the catering menus."}
{"text":"What a great surprise- the staff was friendly, the prices were reasonable and food was great.   You can watch them cook your order fresh - and then assemble your Pita similar to a sub or taco Resturant.   All in All - it felt like a healthier alternative to fast food chains.   Note - Seating is limited for large groups and only cookies for deserts. Reality the pita was so large we did not have room for anything else.   Also note they have a small Coke Free Style system."}
{"text":"Well, I WAS excited to try this place and it was ok. Didn't wow me by any stretch but the place was well cleaned and had very fresh ingredients for their wraps. Kinda like a Subway with Pita Bread. I'll go back and eat there again. The employees were friendly and willing to entertain questions, which was nice."}
{"text":"Yum,yum,yum love this quick little lunch place great to take on a picnic or surprise someone with lunch it's absolutely delicious and Louise has Great customer interfacing. Bathrooms are very clean that's always a plus the place in a whole is very clean"}
{"text":"My new fav place to go during my lunch place at work. I always get the Chicken Caeser Pita with Avocado. It's seriously amazing. I wish I could recreate at home. The pitas are thin and is wrapped like a burrito. I like that too, as I don't like too much bread. Price is good too. I highly recommend. It can get busy, but it's in a prim location for college students and Chase Employees. There is like 50 places to eat around here, all get crowded. So plan accordingly."}
{"text":"I had the small chicken whole wheat pita ($4.99). The process is similar to Chipolte in that you choose your own fresh ingredients. I choose romaine lettuce, cucumbers, red onion, provolone cheese and tzatziki sauce. The pita is streamed and the meat is heated on a griddle.  The food was tasty and just the right size for lunch. The staff was efficient and friendly. The place is clean. Parking is a bit dicey at this location since the Pita Pit is sandwiched between Little Ceasars pizza and Firehouse subs and the small parking lot is not enough for the traffic. Additionally, the road in front of these store is seriously torn up with road work."}
{"text":"Glad to see Pita Pit in this neighborhood!  I've been to other locations, but since I spend so much time in Mid Town, this spot hits the location mark.  The parking lot is a tight squeeze, but once inside, you'll find a clean, comfortable restaurant with a friendly staff.  I ordered the Prime Rib Pita (pictured) and was glad there was NO GRIZZLE!  All pitas are customizable with an assortment of crisp, cold veggies and dressings.  Pricing can be a little high.  One pita (no sides, drink or dessert) plus tax and tip was close to $11.  I wish I hadn't forgotten to take advantage of the Yelp check in discount.  Watch for signage which may help keep your bill at bay."}
{"text":"I eat at Pita Pit at least four days a week since this is the healthiest food on Mill. The varieties of vegetables, meats, and condiments is amazing! My usual pita has at least thirteen fresh veggies on a whole wheat pita. The smoothies and cookies are delicious. Rachelle and her crew always offer excellent service. And Friday is five dollar pita day. So next time you are on Mill why eat a burger or pizza or pastie or a sub when you can have a healthy pita from Pita Pit!"}
{"text":"WiFi password is really complicated.  This is a cool place to get something different for lunch.  They have all kinds of different pitas and usually have some kind of promotional pita as well.  If you want to sit and eat there, make sure you do not go right at lunch time as seating is limited and it will be very hard to find a place."}
{"text":"Good food. They were a tad slow considering we were the only 2 people there. Cool concept. Kinda like subway for pita sandwiches."}
{"text":"Quick and very friendly service! Had a steady flow of customers outside of regular lunchtime hours but not busy enough that you had any wait time.  Pita was delicious and well made not stingy at all with ingredients. There are only four seats but my friend and I were the only ones eating in so it was totally fine."}
{"text":"Pita pita is amazing. Eat there 2-4 times a week. At night the workers are very friendly, helpful and fun. During the day, the manager (I think he is anyway) is extremely rude and makes the experience awful"}
{"text":"I must agree with other Yelpers that the staff here was not friendly whatsoever. I had never been to a Pita Pit before and I will not go back. You'd be better to take your money to an actual Mediterranean restaurant (fast food or not) and have fresher food with some flavor. I ordered the falafel and souvlaki pita of the month. First of all, they have all the meats underneath the grill in a big drawer. Everything was processed and of poor quality. My pita had maybe 3 little pieces of chicken and it was the kind of slimy chicken you get on the BK Broiler at Burger King. Disgusting. The falafel tasted like mush. The rest of the toppings were just ordinary wilted looking vegetables.   Probably the worst part of the experience here was that while I was choosing what toppings I wanted in my pita I asked for hummus and was told \"that costs $1 extra\". I don't mind paying extra, but I was not going to get my credit card back out and go back to the counter behind a line of other guests to pay $1 for a tablespoon of hummus on my pita. The best part about it was the man in front of me asked for hummus and was given it for no extra charge by the other staff member.  So get it straight, is hummus $1.00 or not? And let us know upfront what costs extra because the cash register is at the beginning of the line!"}
{"text":"Quick, delicious, healthy if you want it.  Attentive staff and reasonably priced.  Join thei e club for free chips and drink!"}
{"text":"I have notoriously been a Pita PIt fan but I had my first bad experience today when ordering through Door Dash. I ordered my usual - the Gyro, and my sister got the Philly Cheesesteak (her first time). What we received was two cold sandwiches that clearly werent our order and honestly they were disgusting enough for me not to return to this location.  The \"Philly\" had shredded cheese and no sauce with dry meat and my \"Gryo\" had chicken, picked veggies, extra olives (when I requested none), and some sauce I can't even identify that made the pita soggy and my appetite run out the window. I was hyping this place up to my sister who hadnt tried it before and we are both sad and hungry now!"}
{"text":"Quick easy place to grab lunch. We grabbed some sandwiches before heading to Lake Norman for a day on the water. Enjoyed the Dagwood wrap. Service is friendly."}
{"text":"The food was good, the place was very clean. We got there a food bit before closing at 8. The one girl made it seem like we were bothering her or something(attitude), we had coupons, which made it worse. We had ordered 2 of the wraps and two smoothies. Our food sat getting cold so our smoothies could be made well after  our food was done."}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicken Caesar pita!!! Fucking delicious!!! They said the subway of pita's.... such an understatement!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!  My favorites are the Mediterranean chicken, the buffalo chicken, and the gyro.  The veggies and fixins are great.  I go here at least once a week.  Great rewards program too!"}
{"text":"Very nice staff. Extremely thankful for business and they also just had a \"reopening\" so the place looks really nice!  Other than that, same great healthy Pita Pit food."}
{"text":"Oh Philly Cheese Steak Pita! Lets just say that's definitely a favorite for me here. Located right along the base of the Hearst Tower next to several restaurants, I can see why this place would get business. I came here after a wonderful yelp event to fill the rest of my stomach (and to soak up some of that alcohol.)  This place will probably remind you of how Charlotte is really a city, and that restaurants at the bottom of skyscrapers really do exist here. This place would be a wonderful spot to eat at for lets say a quick lunch, or a light dinner.   Now, to my Philly Cheese Steak Pita: It was amazing. I did however put my twist on my pita as you can choose the many different options of toppings to add to your pita. The originals I kept: provolone, peppers, onions, the normal things that came with the pita. The extras I added: lettuce, tomatoes, olives (yes, I know who puts olives on a philly cheese? And my answer: an awesome person that's who.)  Anyways, in the end I came out with a full and happy stomach, a little sober, and my satisfaction meter was topped off. Pita pit is wonderful for those quick occasions with a group of friends and good times."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. I ordered online clearly stating what I wanted on my food and it was entirely wrong. I ended up with a pita with meat and over a handful of banana peppers, something literally no one could eat. I called and they told me I couldn't be refunded or get anything because I went through post mates but if I want to drive there they'll give me a new one when I just paid to get it delivered? Horrible service. Never again."}
{"text":"I agree with Crystal, its a crap shoot on the service there due to the college town atmosphere and if the employees actually care or not. We went over the summer, not many students so the service was pretty decent. I do agree that the veggies and \"extras\" could be cooked a little bit more, might try to have them grill the veggies when I initially order and take them off once my party has fully orders.   In a neat little walkway through kent...and stop across the way for some ice cream as well"}
{"text":"I paid $6.40 for a small hard and cold pita with 4 1/2 inch pieces of \"souvlaki chicken\", a pretty pathetic smear of hummus and a tzatziki that was pretty much just plain yogurt, a ton of onions and a ton of green pepper to make it a little bulky. When i told the server that they should put more content on their pitas for the price they charge he said he absolutely agrees with that.   I really enjoy other places where they charge 1 or 2 more dollars for a full combo with more than twice the amount of chicken and quality hummus and tzatziki."}
{"text":"I finally decide to stop at this place a few weeks ago. I always see it as I drive by.   At first it seem like any other sandwich place, however, it does have a unique bread type that I have not seen elsewhere. Hence the name, I do like pita and I have bought it at the grocery store to eat at home. I must say I have not seen to many of these places around but this one.   The selection of veggies is what I like the most, plus the chesses. Everything is put together in front of you so it feels like faster service. I have been here a few more times since the first time and while it is not my go to place for a nice sandwich, I will come back."}
{"text":"Very fresh ingredients. My pita was awesome! I had the Philly Steak and it totally was a palate pleaser. They stuff them big like in Texas.  The staff were fun and interactive. It was a Grand Opening, so the training wheels were off. The best part is that I was invited to assist in the ribbon cutting. #vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"I wanted to like it, I really did.  I suggested it to a co-worker about 1 hour before I went, as he wanted to try something new.  He was back in the office with food in 15 minutes.  I went about an hour later, and was the only one in the place, upon my arrival.  1 sandwich and 2 pita & hummus took 35 minutes.  Note, this was a Saturday at 12:15.  Imagine the delay on a weekday lunch rush ... you would be ordering your dinner.   They could only cook one thing at a time, it seems.  A family of three came in after me and ordered two sandwiches that they cooked instead of finishing my order. That family ate and left before I got my order.  There was also another guy who ordered after me and was served before I was.  There was another couple who snuck in there as well.  That was 5 orders served while they tried to warm 2 pitas. I tipped 30% in advance,because I always do ... might have to stop that.  The staff was apologetic, but most of that time was to warm the 2 pitas, the wrap had dried out from sitting for 30 minutes.   Also, seems the large and small wraps are the same size, as my large was the same size as my co-worker's small.  I noticed the same thing on the family's order, as his large was the same as her small. They are new so perhaps they will get better, but I will not be back to find out.  The food was tasty enough, I am always a bit fearful of the partially cooked chicken they warm up.  In this case, that fear was justified, as the meal had me away from my desk for an hour ... search for my hidden meaning.   If you want a good wrap or a great hummus bowl, go to Pita Bistro 1/2 mile away - save the wait time and the lost work time after the meal ... or visit ZK Grill for platters, wraps and hummus.  Bothe of these places are faster, better and have a larger menu.  Try Pita Jungle, perhaps, slow but a big menu and they do take-out if you call ahead.  There are too many good spots around with the same style of food - 3 others within a 1 mile radius and maybe 6 or 7 within a 3 mile radius.  You can literally watch diners at Pita Jungle while you wait (and wait) for your food here.  I cannot figure out why someone would open any restaurant in this building, as everything closes there and the rent is high, even Cafe Rio clapped out and they were always packed.  Further, why would anyone open type of restaurant in this area, as it is already saturated with similar eateries.  The answer must be, because they can excel and out perform the competition - they will need to work harder and get a new grill. I wish them luck - I hate to see any venture fail, as their are folks depending on it to succeed.  That said, I wonder what will be there a year from now."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fresh and delicious. Lots of options and a friendly atmosphere. Joshua is great and always remembers my special requests without me even asking. :)"}
{"text":"This is a great pita place, the staff is friendly and very considerate. I forgot  my phone on the table when I left and the staff chased me to the busstop to return my phone :) the food is really good  but they stuff the pita with too much lettuce and the croutons are often stale other than that I have no complaints. The atmosphere is great and the music is awesome, I am overall satisfied and will defiantly be coming  often"}
{"text":"Pita pit is always one of my go to places for a meal on the run so I have a good idea what to expect. The food is almost the same as every other pita pit with 2 exceptions.  1. They're a lot lighter with the toppings and lettuce for the salad.   2.  It's served up with a whole lot of attitude from 1 employe. If a side of bitchiensss is what you need you can get it here for free!"}
{"text":"Soo if I could I'd do a half star. Dining room is gross and the food looks like it's been sitting out all day. Gross and when I asked for my bacon to be super crispy the kid laughed to the kid that was about to make the meal.  Like I'm sorry this kid had braids hanging down on his face  Health code violation time 10. Just so much grossness going on. Don't bother here"}
{"text":"It is finally open!  :)  I stumbled upon this gem while working in North Dakota and when I saw that one was going to reside by my work I was elated! I am a big fan of the pita!  They have lots of vegetarian options for those who aren't meat eaters and for those who are they won't be disappointed by the options available either.  What impresses me the most about this place though is their ample selection of vegetable toppings and different types of sauces.  This place is definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Food was great and Kaylynn was super nice and accommodating. I love anywhere with vegan options but this was exceptional. Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken souvlaki. There was very little meat and I'm not sure what the meat was. Dark meat with gristles. And barely warm. The veggies were fresh but I tossed it in the garbage after two bites. I say stay away from the mysterious meat souvlaki."}
{"text":"Pita Pit is similar to Subway for Pitas. You select a basic menu item, then customize it down the assembly line. The finished product is delicious and the ingredients seem to always be fresh.  My biggest complaint with this store isn't the food, but the high employee turnover rate. It seems like every time I'm in there, someone new is working on my sandwich. Pitas are prone to falling apart and this is constantly the case with the new workers.  If you can live with eating a delicious pita as its falling apart, then this place is great."}
{"text":"I have never been in Pita Pit, but Carnegie Mellon catered Pita Pit in for some kind of speaker one day.  I didn't attend the speaker, but there was remaining free food.  Score.  I had a gyro pita and some kind of steak pita.  The gyro one was definitely better.  A few reviewers have said this is healthy, but I don't think these are really \"healthy.\"  They're healthy like Subway is healthy, you know?  The veggies were crisp and fresh, and the wraps were a great size.  I have no idea what the cost was so this review is strictly on taste.  Would I trek over to the store to get the pitas on my own time?  Probably not.  But Pita Pit is good for a catered lunch if you need that kind of thing."}
{"text":"I love this place ! The good is always fresh and delicious! The employees are always super friendly. Great customer service and great food can't ask for anything better!!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I was told that I could not use a Groupon because there was not a manager on duty to approve it. A few weeks later Groupon emailed me a letter saying that I was refunded my money due to issues with Pita Pit. The food was also awful. I don't even know how this place is still in business. Stay away!!"}
{"text":"I miss pita pit. I'm from California and lived in Montreal for a few months for work. And I would go to pita pit almost every other day for their delicious pitas. Maybe it's because I can't find any where I lived or maybe I romantiscized the whole trip pita pit included. But all I have is good memories. People complain because the staff was rude to them. Well, everyone in Montreal is that way. Especially the french. So I don't really count that in my review. The food is what matters and the food was great."}
{"text":"A REALLY GOOD LOOKING DUDE WORKS HERE NOW?! i haven't been here in like over half a year but damn why when i leave? anyways he was probably new cause he gave off this awkward vibe but homeboi still made me a good pita   **WHATS THE DUDES NAME UGHH !!?"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Pita Pit in the loooooongest time. It must have been at least a few years. I was seriously craving a pita from there because I love the option of them adding pineapples to a pita.  I went to the Kennedy/Lawrence location and it was disappointing. Although I appreciated the cute glittery Halloween décor, the restaurant itself seemed fairly cold like they are trying to save on heat. Not very comfortable if I wanted to sit down and eat. And I can't quite understand it , but there's an air about that place that seems kinda dirty.  I figured I was already there so I might as well order. I ordered the Southwest Chipotle Chicken Pita. It's grilled chicken tossed in Southwest Sauce with grilled peppers, onions and mushrooms and then you can add whatever other topping once it's off the grill. The toppings looked quite fresh from where I was standing. I've been to a few Subway Locations where the toppings didn't look as great so I was happy to see Pita Pit took pride in the fresh veggies. After I ordered my toppings I walked to the cash and this young dude charges me nearly $10 for the pita. I look at him and say \"Ummm I got the 6inch\" and he rudely says \" Oh! Well you're supposed to TELL me that!\" and then reduced the price to the $6 that it SHOULD have been for the size pita I ordered. I kinda gave him a bizarre screwed face because I wasn't expecting that answer and the rude tone. You would think he'd ask me what size I got instead of assuming I got a foot-long pita. He kinda laughed it off after because I think he realized I wasn't impressed.  I ate the pita and it was great going down! Tasted VERY good! I was so content happily munching on this tasty pita but not long after my stomach started having a horrible reaction to what I ate. Without getting into too much detail...let's just say the Pita got me VERY sick. I have no idea why though. My only conclusion is that something may have been wrong with the chicken. Maybe it was expired and old? Who knows? But I have a very strong digestive system and RARELY get sick like that. While I wouldn't boycott Pita Pit all together I'd definitely boycott THAT location."}
{"text":"Finally decided to give this place a second try and I am glad I did! First time I visited it was crazy inside, but this time very quiet and the three young ladies behind the counter were very helpful and friendly. I decided to go with a salad this time and made it southwest style (corn, black beans, avocado, roasted red peppers, shredded pepper-jack cheese, jalapeno ranch dressing, etc). The salad was packed full of veggies and some grilled chicken! Made for a very tasty and filling meal. I would go back!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a pita pit in years and I was glad I stopped by today. The staff was pleasantly nice.  I ordered the chicken pita large size on whole wheat. All the toppings were included in the price and I had my grilled. Ingredients tasted fresh and flavorful I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Well, they had a staffing overhaul and all is right again in this little Smithfield pita place.  Replacing the grumpy young men of yore is a small fleet of friendly gals.  The place does still get backed out the door some weekday lunchtimes but the line does move along fairly quickly.  Much improved!!"}
{"text":"This place has very clear pros and cons... We will start with the pros. The server and pita maker was very nice and accommodating. The food is all fresh, made right in front of you. The cons are... No place to sit expect a few bar stools, disgusting/dirty bathrooms and weird music playing."}
{"text":"A previous reviewer described this franchise as the subway of pita sandwiches. What's the major, glaring difference? The food here tastes about ten times better.  It's not exactly cheap, as a pita tends to run anywhere from 6-8 bucks. You can do the extra meat or whatever if you're feeling extra hungry. Obvious bear says what? (What?!) This particular location largely caters to the UNLV crowd right across from the street and the workers appear to be students themselves. They've been polite and helpful everytime I stopped by-- making sure to answer questions and describe menu items that were unclear. Business seems modest here but I imagine they are getting by just fine during the rush hours.  The basic business model is this-- you pick the type of meat and then customize it in front of an assortment of chopped vegetables ala subway. I love that they offer a wheat pita, and alfalfa sprouts. Other choices include romaine lettuce, roasted tomatoes, cucumbers, and banana peppers. Among sauces you can opt for a tsatziki sauce (a good idea with chicken souvlaki), hummus, or various other sauces including chipotle mayo, ranch etc. Among cheese options, they wisely include feta and pepper jack. The local special is barbecued chicken, grilled with jalapenos and onions. It went well with chipotle mayo and green peppers. I've also tried the chicken souvlaki, and I thoroughly enjoyed the grilled steak. Depending on how much, or what sort of sauces you choose to add to your creation, you can leave with something that is pretty darn healthy for fast food and doesn't taste half bad. If you are at all conscious about what sort of foods you eat, you'll find this place to be a refreshing choice."}
{"text":"I'be loved this place since college but haven't been here since then. This place is uptown and great for lunch. The lines don't get too long either. The staff was help, nice, and they made the food fast and good. My chicken and bacon wheat pita was really good and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The best place ever great worker's you could go there every day they treat you like family. Check out pita pit"}
{"text":"Love pita pit! Great alternative to fast food. I usually order the buffalo chicken pita and add ranch. The place is clean and ingredients look fresh. I will say though, it's never crowded in there and I can't figure out why. It's basically a subway for pitas."}
{"text":"It was delicious, but I found it too overpriced. The breakfast ones used to be cheap, but now since you can add any veggie they added $4 to the price. It's like $8-9!"}
{"text":"I live super close to Pita Pit but this weekend was my first experience at the south side location. I had been to the downtown location before it closed a few years ago.  I actually came here twice this weekend. Saturday I stopped in for dinner and ordered a small club (turkey, ham, bacon-grilled) I loaded it up with lettuce, mushrooms, tomatoes, carrots, pepperjack cheese and ranch. It tasted so dang fresh omg. I craved it the next day for lunch and ordered the same thing.. only a regular this time. Both times the staff were nice to me.  The bathroom smells odd though. I warned you."}
{"text":"Good prices, simple but good food and best of all super fast delivery! My go to when I don't feel like leaving the house!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here yet as I didn't know there was a Pita Pit in Las Vegas!! I loved eating there when I lived on the East Coast and I just decided today to look up if there was a Pita Pit here in Vegas (I didn't have my hopes up since I've never seen one). I'm pretty excited about this find and I'll write an update once I get my hands on a delicious pita."}
{"text":"So good.! Ive been here 4 or 5 times already and I order the same thing each time. The falafel pita. It was so good. The price is excellent for the quality and size of what you get. Make sure you get a card so you can get points and then get a free pita! They load you up with a ton of ingredients, all your choice. Did you know pineapple goes with falafel? Well, it does! I was really crazy about the humus or tsiziki sauce, but with all the other stuff, who cares! Service is always friendly and quick. I love that no matter how many people are in line in front of me, I'm always eating in less than 5 minutes. A freshly made, delicious pita stuffed with all my favorite ingredients...thank you pita pit!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place opened! Great menu with different items ranging from chicken, eggs, falafel, veggie, turkey, ham pitas. Everything is cooked on a hot flat top while they stuff your pita to your liking. Endless ingredients sauces including 5 cheeses! All you want stuffed into your pita like a burrito! I was in and out in less than a few minutes. This place is a great stop for lunch breaks because you get your food quick. I heard this place does get busy during prime meal times so time yourself accordingly. I went in around 330 and there was only 3 other people in there with me and we got our food quickly. You can get any wrap as a salad if carbs is not your thing. There are also yummy smoothies to try too. There are chips, freestyle coke machine, and bottled beverages for purchase.  This is a great fast food place with healthy and filling options. Check it out! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pita Pit is one of my favorite places to grab a quick bite to eat that I feel is a healthier alternative to typical fast food. Pita Pita offered a wide variety of meat choices, toppings  and sauces. Very affordable too! This Pita Pit is newly opened and ready to get to know their neighborhood. When we stopped by Santa was there!"}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight with my wife, I ordered a Prime Rib Gyro and my wife had the regular. Both were delicious and very satisfying. We will be back, a little dead so I hope more people give them a try."}
{"text":"This place is very good, I wish I were on State Street more often to be able to pick up lunch here. They're a great alternative to more greasy options or the Subway-type of sandwich shops (bleh). The staff was always friendly and helpful, and I found it to be a good deal for a great sandwich. Highly recommended! Open a store on the East side please!"}
{"text":"I've never been more disappointed in the service at a pita pit. I ordered what I always get and payed. Then, he proceeded to tell me how they were out of green peppers, ancho chipotle, and boom boom sauce. Well if I would've been told that beforehand I wouldn't have ordered and payed for anything. Pita pit was one of my favorite quick meals before and I will never be coming back..."}
{"text":"Pita Pit is a favorite of mine. First time stopping at this location, and we had 12 of us in our party.  Wonderful service, fresh/vibrant food and toppings, and overall positive experience.  They didn't even get mad when we pushed a bunch of tables together so we could all sit together.  Thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"Okay fine I lied. I came back here today.  It seems the less lunch I make the more dillema there is about where to eat everyday. Finding rather healthy cheap fast food around UofT is a challenge in itself but I realized that Pita Pit is probably one of your best bets (sadly).   For $6.50 I got a whole wheat pita stuffed with healthy vegetables and chicken breast, al-beit it was about half a chicken breast worth. Their veggies aren't really as fresh as I'd like (you could see them becoming soggy and discolouring). But what's a student to do when he doesn't want Ken Ho's for lunch everyday!  *Ken Ho refers to the chinese food truck that lurks outside of the engineering buildings at UofT waiting for oncoming students to attack with its heart-attack inducing food."}
{"text":"Philly steak pita is my go-to. Great lunch spot. Now that the nice weather has arrived they pull back the windows that open out to College St."}
{"text":"Came in at 11 on a Saturday to grab a pita, the time this location is suppose to open on this day is 11am. As soon as I walked in the employee working said he was not open yet. When I asked him what time do they open, he replied with, \"we open when I'm ready.\" Piss poor customer service."}
{"text":"the staff was friendly and explained what to expect since I was a first time customer. other reviewers said it's like subway for pits, but quite frankly I think subway flatbread sandwiches are much better, and trust me, that's not much of a compliment. The store was clean, and pretty much no one else was there, which was kinda nice. But the dude making my food had a pretty significant beard with nothing over it when he's making food. most respectable establishments these days require at least some kind of barrier so their beard hairs don't get in the food. their soda machine was awesome though with the customizable flavors of soda and such. overall, just didn't taste good enough or wow me enough to want to return. plus, one tuna pita with a drink was over 9 bucks? seriously, way overpriced considering I could have paid that much for a burrito at Chipotle or less for a subway footlong in the same strip mall. this price point makes no sense given the competition."}
{"text":"So I got a coupon in the mail.  I really wanted to try this place when they first opened.  But when I saw that a pita was almost $8.00, I refused to go there.  I hate spending that kind of money on a sandwich, I'm not sure I'm going to like.  So anywhooo!  I went there, and I got a chicken pita, and got my hubby the Philly steak pita.  It's like subway sandwich, they have so many toppings, and sauces, it was so hard to choose what topping to put on it.  Our pita's were so big, she couldn't hardly close it.  All I know is it's worth the $8.00!  We loved our pita's there big enough for 2 people, or eat half for lunch and half for dinner. As long as there here, Subway sandwich won't ever see me again!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but it's overrated to the max! I normally don't review fast food chains, but I'm totally confused by all the extreme positivity here.  The concept? They take a pita and stuff it with whatever you want. It's kind of like Chipotle in that sense (or Subway, I guess? I've never been to Subway nor have I had a desire to), except without the streamlined assembly line convenience. What makes no sense to me is that you pay first, upon deciding what meat you want. It's also at this point that you must decide if you want anything that costs extra or has to be cooked, like hummus or grilled onions. Then after you pay, you get to choose the rest of your toppings. Why? Why not do what just about every other fast food establishment does and get all your options out of the way BEFORE you pay so you don't get stuck deciding you want to add guacamole at the last minute and having to get back in the register line to give them a couple quarters? It's such a simple little thing, but it really bothers me.  Also, I've been to this location on multiple occasions and everyone who works here always looks like they are in serious need of a hug. Why IS that? Where do they find these people? Maybe they post Help Wanted flyers at grievance support groups? Seriously, as someone who works in customer service, nothing bothers me more than an employee who does not smile and greet a customer. It's really the easiest part of your job, yet it makes a huge impact. Again, SIMPLE things, but things that leave an impression (at least on me).  So Pita Pit...work on your operational model and hiring practices, and I could be alright with you. Until then, the way you go about your business will continue to confuse me and I'd rather not bother with it.  PS: I realize that I barely mentioned the food, but it's just that unmemorable. Not bad, per se, but their cold, dry pitas are whatever. It's fine if you just want healthy fast food and you happen to be in the Southside, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is close to my work and very fast. They have everything from veggie to meat options to cater to everyone's needs. The print out online makes it easy to take my coworkers' orders.   I usually just say a veggie and I can add whatever I want with no additional cost. The place is never really busy so the service is always fast. I hate sandwiches but LOVE pita. I make mine veggie and light and stillthey are huge and filling."}
{"text":"Really bad staffing. I went in and ordered a chicken ceaser. No time in the past have they ever put tomatoes on the pita. When he began putting them on I immediately said I did not want them and apologized more than once. He said nothing to me and gave me a dirty look. The girl standing next to him gave me one as well. He then scraped the tomatoes off and threw them BACK INTO THE TOMATO CONTAINER after they've already touched all my other items in my pita. They did not apologize once, gave me dirty looks. This was a terrible experience because of the disrespect I received by teenagers working at a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"This was our go to eatery in New York when I was in college 2001-2005. The few that existed in California have closed since 2005. So I was very excited to see that one existed in Vegas.   I got my usual grilled chicken pita.  The order taker told the sandwich maker to throw a chicken, and instead of doing it then going back to reorganizing the station (which makes sense cause it takes some time for the chicken to heat) she finished what she was doing first. I then  asked her to change her gloves because I'm very sensitive to onions and peppers which she had been handling. She did it but wasn't very happy about it.   I guess the new thing they do is steam the pita. She did it before I could stop her. I asked her to use a new unsteamed pita which totally annoyed her. Then we had to wait longer for the chicken to finish. The iceberg lettuce was kind of bitter because it was mostly yellow. Also I'm not liking the slices of cheese. What happened to shredded cheese? Anyways the experience sucked and my pita wasn't very good. I only ate half of it and threw the rest away. I guess I will have to live off my memories."}
{"text":"Great food in a nice, clean, friendly environment. Good options and fair prices. My only complaint is it feels like an interrogation room when you go up to order....the lights are WAY to  bright."}
{"text":"We checked out this location when we were a little dissuaded from the Hawaiian joint next door. I had a falafel because I am a creature of habit and I was oddly impressed. The environment felt a little industrial and our voices seemed to travel inside there. The falafel was absolutely delicious! the ability to choose my own toppings made it even more appealing. The dude had a beach club pita or something loke that and was also enticed to choose his own toppings. We both enjoyed our meals and where it might take us a minute to go back due to location, the staff and service were both favorable."}
{"text":"I love the Chicken Souvlaki! You can customize with fresh ingredients including avocado, hummus, pineapple, veggies galore and the pita bread is always fresh and perfect!"}
{"text":"This was my first time dinning at Pita Pit. The setup reminds me of a Subway, you order your pita sandwich or salad & then proceed to the assembly area to choose toppings. Their sandwiches are served wrapped in pita bread & they have a large selection of sandwiches to choose from. They also have a good selection of veggies, cheeses & sauces to choose from.   Vegetarian options in the Nortera Shopping Center area are few & far between. Pita Pit is not a vegetarian restaurant by any means, however they do have several veggie pita sandwiches.   The Hummus Pita tasted really good! The toppings & the pita bread seemed very fresh. While the pita could have been filled with more hummus & veggies, the size was probably sufficient. I will definitely be back to try some of the other options."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Pita pit never disappoints. Check out the app Hooked, can get 2 pita's for $10. Saves you a couple bucks."}
{"text":"I only ate here once and enjoyed is so much.  I can't wait to go back.  Its basically you can create you own pita.  The toppings are fresh and the line moves pretty fast.  Its a charlotte must hit in my book."}
{"text":"This is the best Pita Pit location I have been to so far. The prices are great. The staff are friendly and welcoming. I even met the owners -  they are really nice. The place is so clean. What I love best is the quality of the servings. Their food is always looking fresh and it tastes great. If you ask for double meat, trust me, you will get double meat. I would highly recommend that people visit this Pita Pit location."}
{"text":"This Pita Pit location is pretty good. I really enjoy going there. The food is great, the people are friendly and the price is right. I personally love their tuna and chicken souvlaki pitas."}
{"text":"It is great to have right in our neighborhood a place where you can get food at a fast pace with healthy options. You can even order a pita salad, which is all the ingredients that would go inside the pita bread but served on a bed of lettuce. There are several tasty options for vegetarians. They offer whole wheat pita bread as well. There are breakfast pita options. You can eat there, or get it to go. Let's support our local businesses, as the owner is a family man that lives right in the neighborhood, who also sponsors a lot of local events."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Pita Pit since living in Gainesville, FL, where I was introduced to the chain. When we were in Vegas, we decided to order some. I drove from the hotel to Pita Pit and it took about 15-20 mins. This place was oddly empty, so either it's not a big hit as it was in the Gator Nation, or Pita Pit is just slow on Mondays, or something...  Either way, the food was good, the service was good (there was only one person working at around 7:30pm), but nothing to write home about. I had the gyros, my wife had the chicken souvlakis, and my daughter had a hummus pita."}
{"text":"I have benn coming here at least one a month maybe twice for the last 2 years.  I usually order the Grecian pita but, of couse sometimes i change it up.  That comes with lamb and chicken meat in it.  It is absolutely delicious.   My favorite thing about pita pit is they let you add as many vegtables as you want to the pita.  My pitas are always huge and full of vegtables.  It is very filling and I never need anything else after that.  The meat is fresh and cooked right in front of you.  Everyone is always polite and curitious even when it's slammed.  I would highly recommend this restarant looking for a very quick and very healthy meal."}
{"text":"PIta Pit is another of my work lunch favorites. From the falafel to the cheese pitas, I've never been lead astray by anything on their menu. The tzaziki sauce is as good as it gets, and the staff will get generous with it if you keep asking for more. I like to get my sandwiches so stuffed that I can barely get my mouth around the freakin' things.  The food is good, which means that the lines are long during lunch hour, so only try to go if you've got time. This little strip of Tryon makes me happy because there's several options close together: Soho Bistro for excellent Chinese takeout at reasonable prices and Fuel Pizza are the Pita Pit's next door neighbors. It's a great little area to go get something for everyone in your office.  Most of the time, I'd land at the Pita Pit for the wide variety of veggie options. Their pita bread, also, is a miracle of food science. It's stretchy and bready at the same time. I wish I could have these things at home."}
{"text":"There are so many choices of where to eat when you live in Las Vegas. One day my friend and I were cruising around tryna find something new. Stopped in at Pita Pit, the first thing I noticed was how clean it was which is always a huge thing for me. The staff was friendly and engaging, the food was both fulfilling and didn't leave us feeling terrible after. You gotta stop by Pita Pit and give it a shot.   PS try the Gyro!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for awhile. Basically it's like a subway but for pittas. The staff was very friendly and my hummus in wheat with toppings was really good. My boyfriend and daughter seemed to really like theirs as well. Only complaint is the price. I think it's a little over priced but I'd probably still come here again."}
{"text":"It saddens me to see the low reviews.  I will readily admit that my first couple of experiences with this location were not the best. . .both beiing through Ubereats.  However, the owners have responded with the level of integrity and conviction which has made me a loyal customer.  This is the only location I will now frequent.  They are second to none in terms of their attention to detail, quality of service that does not stop short to the quality of food served.  If you want authentic Greek then go find it somewhere else and stop complaining about a family that offers good qualiy food at a reasonable price.  I love their Gyros, but my husband loves the Dagwood. . . .it's a perfect restaurant to meet a wide variety of tastes..  The tzatsiki could be better as noted in other reviews. . .and I measure that against Daphnes recipe which is no longer available in my neck of the woods, but it's not a deal breaker by any means. . . .still very respectable.  This location does not disappoint."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place you need to! Food is healthy and fresh. They give you a TON of options / veggies without up charging you. Staff is always amazing and friendly. Always a clean environment."}
{"text":"This location is AMAZING and shows the most incredible integrity. When Grub Hub didn't translate the special note for ingredients to be removed due to allergy reasons, Richard (General Store Manager) went above and beyond to correct it. Even as far as to supervise a remake and deliver it himself! Seriously, more than I could have ever hoped for."}
{"text":"Have only been here once, after the Mifflin Street Block party, so yes, I was pretty intoxicated.  And I remember my pita being amazing.    It's nice having a fast-food, pita place.  I usually prefer local eateries over chains but this is an exception.  Reminds me of  a Subway for Gyros."}
{"text":"Came here over the weekend and was highly disappointed. I ordered a traditional gyro and was not pleased with the quality of the meat as well as the Greek yogurt sauce. I've had better gyros at the local mall in California."}
{"text":"So I had Pita Pit tonight for dinner and it was so-so. Its definitely a subway-esque fast food joint.  I got the chicken souvlaki and was really disappointed by the quality of the chicken, it very spongy and some pieces seemed discolored.  The vegetables tasted fresh though and the pita itself was good I just couldn't stomach that meat.  If for some reason I find myself back at Pita Pit I'd definitely go the veggie route."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and delicious and perfection. The staff and owner are super friendly too. Also hilarious !"}
{"text":"I haven't actually gone into this Pita Pit location, so this review is for delivery. Their delivery fee was only $1, but now I think it is free, but either way, super cheap delivery. The first time I used delivery, the delivery guy went to the wrong apartment, but luckily, I saw him outside and was able to get my food and the second time, he came to the right place. The food is simple, but good and not a bad price for what you get. I usually get a soda and chips with whichever pita I decide on getting. I like the fact that I can pick what I want to put on my pita. Pita Pit is perfect for quick food."}
{"text":"If I could swear and still get published I would leave a review saying this is the best  bleeping place on planet earth. From the friendly service to the fire bleep food. Will come back here again and again."}
{"text":"The owner is so nice and he is always there! Fresh, clean place. I stop in about once a week. So far the gyro is my favorite.   Give it a try, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Simple easy place to get quick grub.   Came here one afternoon after a workout sesh across the street, and just wanted something quick and healthy. Thanks to the Yelp app, we got 10% off our order. Always nice to get a discount. The pita came out pretty quick, we also added some grilled onions and bell peppers for flavor. The hummus was consistent and flavorful.   Service was nice, efficient, and quick. Food is on par with other Pita Pit locations."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place, word travels fast in space.... it is what it is, a fast, inexpensive, easy, no waiting, clean and friendly place to grab a quick bite. Oh, and it's good too. It's been said already and I'll repeat it - it's like a sandwich shop with a decent selection of toppings, spreads and sauces.  The only thing I was a little disappointed with is that I was expecting more Mediterranean items, with the exception of the souvlaki chicken (which I had and was quite good) and humus and feta cheese, the majority of the pita options were of your typical deli style choices, roast beef, ham, etc. doesn't mean it's not good, just a bit different than I was expecting.  I got the souvlaki chicken, not breast meat but still good, grilled to order, warm and soft pita, fresh tasting. What more can you ask for, and pay less than $7 for? Yes, if it was free it'd be even better but either way, enjoy if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday. Note that they only have 5 tables inside; we (including our 4yr old) ended up having to eat in our car because there was nowhere to eat inside. The staff was incredibly disorganized; to the point of mutual frustration for having to work over each other in order to assemble the pitas. In short, this isn't a very family friendly place and their gluten free options are incredibly slim. The food is below average (think Subway, but for pitas). We will probably not be back."}
{"text":"Great pita's! They have a ton of toppings to choose from and sauce's. Great place for a quick bite. I wish I would have found this place sooner."}
{"text":"Pita Pit is my FAVORITE restaurant! If you've never eaten here you HAVE TO try it! I love everything about this place. The vegetables are extremely high quality and fresh. There is no wait and they grill the chicken or steak right in front of you. Ask for it \"Loaded\" meaning onions, mushrooms, and peppers right on the grill. They also have pineapple, artichoke, black beans, and even roasted tomatoes. You can't compare it to any other fast food restaurant because it's very healthy with giant servings. $7.25 is the total after tax. It's cheap! They also have real fruit smoothies for $4. So worth it! Great date place."}
{"text":"Maybe it was because I was getting over a cold when I went a couple months ago, but this really did not leave a good impression on me at all.  I had the falafel and it was dry, bland and fell apart easily.  Veggies do seem fairly fresh, I will give them that."}
{"text":"I love this place. I work one block away so I get to come here all of the time for a quick, healthy and delicious lunch. The staff is friendly and often remembers my order which is always a nice touch. The pita fillings are fresh and crispy and I love that they cook the meat in front of you while your pita is getting stuffed. In the summer they set up outside seating which is prime people watching!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Delicious options. Quick service. Everything you need for a healthy quick bite to eat for lunch it dinner."}
{"text":"I haven't had a bad experience here. I get different staff each time. I've met the GM once and proud to say the staff at Dobson/Southern is always tops. Food here is fresh, and delicious. Happy hour 3-6 M-F is $5 Pita and drink. All day Sunday but includes 2 smoothies as well. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and great food! Definitely would recommend! They have awesome workers and their new management is very welcoming Please everyone go check it out! They have some great deals throughout the the week!"}
{"text":"For the best simple, cheap, and delicious meal you could get around the South Side Works, go to the Pita Pit.   I know, I know, this is a bold statement for the area that's home to the Cheesecake Factory and other pretty decent restaurants. But, sometimes you find yourself around the South Side Works area walking around and shopping and all you want is to satisfy a hunger. You don't really want a fancy shmancy meal; you especially don't want to drop one or two Jacksons on dinner. You also don't want to waste good shopping time on eating. You look around the area and your pickins are slim.   Trust me, head over to the Pita Pit. For those of you who don't know what it is - basically, it's Subway on Pitas. You choose your sandwich and then you go to the condiments area and choose your toppings galore. It's got a way better selection than Subway! And, I actually really like their veggie options like hummus and falafel (beats the one selection of Veggie Delight)  Even if you do stumble in here because of my \"quick, easy, and cheap\" recommendation, I assure you the next time you'll go into the Pita Pit just because it was so good the first time around."}
{"text":"I've spent years in the middle east so I'm used to eating different Pitas (and Laffas). Happened upon the location for a meeting and the food is delicious and reasonable. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Great selection and always made to order.  I like both of those!  Pita Pit is one of those places I always forget about while making my lunch decision when I'm at work and for that, shame on me.  It's very clean always, the service is super fast paced and they get you turned around and back on your way in no time.  Get here early though, it gets slammed!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new, found a decent review on Yelp and helped get me there. Had a great experience, good food, for decent price.  Great staff great food.. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"No flavor... Don't waste your time here, just head to pita jungle."}
{"text":"Most of the staff running this place are very friendly, and have been around for years.  It's a solid place for a quick bite to eat late in this area.  Can't go wrong with the chicken breast pita if you spice it up with the right sauces."}
{"text":"i went thier today 12/9/2016 ,yes right after the lousy tom chee (Next door down ) anyway this place is awful i had try thier turkey (like junnile cut ) very junkie  no meat on thier and the so  called pita is yhin and tastless  especially the wheat   anyway the place does ahave the best pop machine hands down ( samea as burger king ,wendys in  north olmsted ) stupid  strongsville dosent have the pop machine at the wendys ,burger king in strongsville,an way back to the review  the topping were  very  fresh though      i wont waiste my money again  very expensive for a pita junk"}
{"text":"It was OK. I got a Tuna Pita combo and it was 9.38. Kinda steep. Your choice of Chips or Cookies. The cookies are otis spunkmeyer as I saw them taking them out of the little oven. The tuna was not mixed so so you can control how much mayo, it appeared they only had shredded cheese, no slices. They had a lot of veggies but their shredded lettuce was like white, no color at all. I had spinach which was appreciated.  It is also SUPER loud in there, so we took are food and use Cafe Rio's chairs which we saw some others doing. I can't say I will be back as the value at Jason's Deli and Caprioitti's is better.."}
{"text":"Pretty good for my 1st visit to one of these places. I ordered the \"Awaken With Bacon\" combo. Comes with a drink and a bag of chips.(like subway) this place actually reminds me of subway except they have a grill and more options of what you can put in your pita roll. Mine had bacon, eggs, hash browns, and I had them add guacamole spread, Spinach and shredded cheddar cheese. You can add sauces to it, but I prefer mine without. Overall good place to eat and healthy also. I'll be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time at pita pit and it was amazing. Everyone is really nice and helped me decide what to get. I asked questions about the food and how everything works here and they were all very polite. On top of them being very polite the pita was delicious. I will definitely be coming back. Also very smart on pita spelled backwards."}
{"text":"Went today first time. Quiet relaxing and very very tasty. Gyro was fresh vegetables were plentiful and perfect for the sandwich  Employee took his time and explained how it was made.   Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Reasonable fast food styled pita - it's like subway but for pitas. I had the Gyro Pita with wheat, and it tasted pretty good ($6.37). There were only two people working there counter though and the lunch line backed up nearly to the door. It's not because it is that good, it is because the stupid cashier kept taking orders and wouldn't help the guy cooking the things. So in the meantime, most people would have left by the time it took to get served (I would have because I had to stand waiting for nearly 20 minutes after I paid, but was locked in). To top it off, the guy cooking kept getting the orders mixed up. He asked me what I ordered and about a minute later he asked me again. This went on repeatedly for every customer. I first thought he was joking, but apparently he wasn't.  But I would eat here for a 'quick' cheap pita again.  Food Quality/Taste = 3 Stars Portion Size Given Price = 3 Price = 3 Stars Service = N/A Experience with Staff = 2 Stars Decor = 3 Stars"}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Like most reviews here, its like a Subway (but better) and your food gets rolled in a pita (white or wheat). Try the Dagwood Pita (Black Forrest Ham, Turkey and Prime Rib) its a-m-a-z-i-n-g. I have tried quite a few different pitas from this place and none of them disappoint.....every pita is great. The restaurant is always clean, staff friendly, and I have yet to wait more than 1-2 minutes to place/pay for my order (they are fast!). If I had one gripe.....and its minor.....the pitas are maybe $1 more than they should be. If they lowered their prices $1 across the board, I bet they would get more business."}
{"text":"For under $10 you get to build you're on pita like Chipotle. Except you they offer to grill items which is awesome! You can grill meats and veggies etc.  For 2 people it was about $18. So it's not bad. I love the idea of paying less and being more full personally. But if you aren't a pig like me, and love pitas. This place is easily for you!"}
{"text":"Sooooo glad they brought a Pita Pit to Ahwatukee. This place is so healthy and fresh. We went in tonight, I ordered the Gyro and my husband ordered the chicken crave. Anthony cooked up the meat and made out Pitas!  They were Delicious and the ingredients were so fresh. We will be back!"}
{"text":"So I was really excited about this place. Who doesn't love a good pita, however I was highly disappointed when I actually got my food. To start: some of the veggies were not in the best condition (brown, old), I ordered chicken and let me tell you it was the worst quality of chicken I've ever had. To the point where I didn't even bother eating it. Every bite was just fat, I'm not even sure I got any chicken!   I also ordered the hummus side, and what a rip off! I got a tiny sauce cup size of hummus and 1 pita that was very crunchy..  And then the staff... yes they were friendly. But very unprofessional, untrained, and they just didn't seem to care they were \"working\"   So will I come back? Definitely not!"}
{"text":"This place is a godsend purely because its open so late, and much healthier than a pizza at 2 am. however i have a bit of a bone to pick with a couple members of the staff. the guys who own the place are great but they seem to hire some very lackadaisical employees. overall food is bearable but definitely not exquisite by any standard"}
{"text":"Love this place! I have gotten the Gyro almost every time; and in the three weeks I've been in Charlotte have probably been here 7 times! Super-fresh, super-fast! The store is always spotless and workers are always friendly. Only bummer; I'm a HUGE fan of tzatziki, I make it at home all the time and the tzatziki here is really sub-par and not very authentic :(, but even having a Gyro on the menu I'll still give it 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"Best pita pit location by far. I eat pita pit on a regular basis and the staff here separates it from the rest. They are very consistent and friendly. they make sure everything is perfect by going above and beyond every single time. It's the same food as every other location but the staff makes this location the best. I go out of my way sometimes to go to this location vs another one."}
{"text":"I hate to do this, but this is the 2nd time I have ordered online, and almost an hour later they called and told me they 'just saw my faxed in order'  Uhm, sorry, I placed it online on YOUR WEBSITE.  If you can't accept/handle online orders that's fine, but don't pretend you can.  The first time they never 'saw' my order, and when I called in an hour later they told me they couldn't reverse the charges on my card.  So I had to get the Pita's still delivered, even though by the time we got them it was 2 hours after we initially ordered.  The delivery guy let it slip that they never put paper in their printer, so no online orders could print.  That's just crazy.  Also, the Pitas aren't as good as the old University location.  Sad, I guess no more Pita's for our office...  :-("}
{"text":"Convenient spot (live around the corner) and friendly staff. Happy hour 3-6 with $5 Pitas and $2.50 smoothies."}
{"text":"Great food!  I highly recommend this place.  I ordered the Dagwood, which has tons of meat.  Add on a bunch of veggies and you got yourself a pretty hefty pita sandwich."}
{"text":"Very delicious. However lettuce looked a little brown so I got spinach instead. Definitely will visit again. I love that it's a healthy option for fast food."}
{"text":"Think \"Subway\" but way more awesome. The Pita Pit has delicious fresh ingredients that you choose to go on whatever style pita you want. I had the chicken crave and added a bunch of tasty veggies. Filling and fairly healthy lunch. I think I'll add the Pita Pit on a regular lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!   From Pacific Beach to San Jose to San Diego I've been to them all!  -Bring the JEKYL AND HYDE (chicken and steak pita) to VEGAS!"}
{"text":"Are they still open?  Just went by and the doors were locked, lights low and someone was in there. Tried to open the doors and the person didn't do anything.  Told a friend about it and Apparently they went recently too and the same thing happen.  However no signs anywhere saying closed And it was 5:30pm when we went.... Weird !"}
{"text":"This place suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks.  Ok. So if you want REAL authentic gyros, go to the Gyro House on Val Vista & Southern or some other place that serves greek.  This is as generic and corporate and inauthentic as you can possibly get. They bill themselves as 'the Subway of gyros'... and well, make of that what you will. When your aspiration is to be like Subway, I believe you lost already coming outta the gate.  The one star I will give them is for friendly service. They are enthusiastic and eager to serve their bland, unamazing and colorless, flavorless slop. The meat doesn't even look real for crying out loud! My wife can make better gyros buying those gyro packs at Winco's! (and that would be a cheaper alternative too. Only 2 of us, my wife and I paid 21 bucks when we coulda fed the whole family off Winco's gyro meat packs for much less and had better meat!)  And the location is disastrous for such a business, too. It's hidden away in such a matter that if you are not shopping at Wal-Mart, you will never be able to notice it from the freeway OR from Greenfield! And that is probably just as well, because this crappy food does not need to be eaten by actual human beings.  Skip it. Your tastebuds and your wallet will thank you later."}
{"text":"I tried Pita Pit for the first time a couple years ago when I received a free gift card from work. I was flustered from beginning to end--- I handed the cashier my gift card as payment, and he just thought it was some sort of promo card. He then asked for my debit card, which I passed over. When I questioned him why my gift card did not run, he was very perturbed and snapped at me when he had to cancel and re-do the transaction. Then, I ordered the Gyro, which anywhere else would not require much description. Well, I was confused by the fact that I was asked what I wanted on my Gyro (um, the usual Gyro ingredients?!) and that Hummus costs additional (which is not ever mentioned at the register when ordering the Gyro).  Maybe I've never gotten over this initial experience, but I have yet to truly enjoy Pita Pit. I think the Pitas are over-filled with meat and sauce and under-filled with vegetables. Though initially tasty, I always feel very ill after eating here... I only plan on returning when I get dragged here yet again by a co-worker trying to avoid the other two chain options on this block of East Carson."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this Pita Pit for a while now and have no complaints. Their service and pita's are fantastic! I highly recommend it to anyone that needs a quick and affordable bite to eat. Thank you Pita Pit for always providing me great lunches!"}
{"text":"I've been trying to watch my caloric intake this week.  I just happened upon this place and thought a pita may be a healthy option.  I am really glad I stopped in and gave this place a try.    When I walked in I had no idea how to order or WHAT to order.  The friendly cashier gladly made recommendations and told me what was most popular.  She also said I had the option to create my own pita.  That's what I did.  I ordered a grilled chicken pita with hummus, avocado, cucumbers, and a little iceburg. It was really good and healthy.  The price was great ($6). The restaurant was clean.  Great experience."}
{"text":"Tonight I had my first experience of a true mouth orgazaim, the customer serviced sucked major ass the male employee there didn't seem alive. The food made up for it so much I will becoming back once a week so this won't be my last experience and the employee also works next door at 3pm, which I find tacky."}
{"text":"I ate at Pita Pit all the time in college and I am so glad they opened here in Mentor!"}
{"text":"Really wasn't expecting much when I came in but I found the pita's really fresh and filling. Good if you just want a quick lunch. Line up could make the wait a bit longer during peak times though. Typical franchised place. I would compare it to Subway but a step above because this place actually cooks meat for your pita rather than a Subway which just heats up already prepared meat."}
{"text":"Great stop for hungry bellies. Rarely come to Henderson but I am glad I spotted Pita Pit. Its been a while since i have had one. It is a very healthy pita alternative with a wide variety of selections. If they had one in Summerlin that would be amazing.  Love the music and friendly faces."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Very convenient to work. The food is always delicious and hot from the flat top. Customer service is amazing. They are helpful and courteous. The bathrooms are spotless and smell like bleach! Love this place. Thank you."}
{"text":"I hardly ever order pita pit, but looking through Grubhub and seeing it pop up, my first thought was \"hmm that sounds good!\" I ordered a pita with teriyaki sauce, and after biting into it, I quickly discover that it is DRENCHED in tzaziki sauce (gross!). When I called the restaurant and asked them for a refund, they told me that they can make me a new one with tzaziki (yes, make it exactly the same way...wrong) or to call Grubhub and then hung up on me. Now, as someone who works in a restaurant that uses Grubhub, I know it is protocol for the restaurant to call Grubhub to give a refund. Even the girl who works for Grubhub customer service asked why I'm calling and they aren't! I keep trying to give them a chance, but this is three times now that my order has been messed up. Either they aren't paying attention to my order, or someone is just deciding what I want/don't want for me."}
{"text":"After a leisurely walk downtown, I stopped here for some dinner tonight before heading back to my hotel. I was glad to come across a place with some healthy options.   First off, I love the fact that the menu tells you exactly how many calories each food item has. This is super helpful for people like me that count calories lol.   I ordered a regular sized grilled chicken pita with avocado, tomatoes, romaine lettuce, roasted red peppers, and cucumbers. It was tasty and I liked that they didn't skimp on any of the fillings, especially the meat. I think my entire meal was less than 400 calories.   The place was empty when I went in, so I was able to get in and out quickly. The associates weren't particularly friendly but they weren't rude. I'd probably return when I come back to the Madison area."}
{"text":"This place is the BEST.  Pretty healthy and filling.  I would order beforehand online to save time."}
{"text":"I love having delivery choices. Anything new and different is welcome in my book. The web-site is a bit confusing. I'll phone in my order until the site is more stream-lined."}
{"text":"Reasons to go to Pita Pit:  1. Deliciously fresh pitas 2. You pick everything that goes on your pita. It is the Harvey's of the good for you food. You want a fish eye with hummus pita**?It's yours! 3. The service is decent 4. It is within stumbling distance of 17th Ave's best watering holes 5. They won't kick your drunk ass out at 2:30 in the morning 6. Last time I was there at 2:30 am, the counter guy was kind of hot. (call me!)  ** Not actually available. They only use land (chicken, beef, pork, lamb, turkey) meat there. Or vegetables! Pita pit is vegetarian friendly!  And might I recommend the chicken pita? Simple yet delicious."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, there was a Pita Pit in College Park where I went to school. In the first semester of my sophomore year, it closed down, never to be heard from again. As a matter of fact, this was around the same time that Fractured Prune closed down.  They were actually right next to each other, so I'm guessing the rent along that strip was just getting too expensive for some places.  That was 10 years ago. Now, I am here visiting my friend in Phoenix, and I see a Pita Pit near the bar that we were at. Needless to say, I was extremely excited to go in and relive my college days.   I decided to get the Thai chicken Pita and it was as flavorful and delicious as the pitas I used to get back in the day. It was around 2 a.m. and a lot of the nearby bars were closing, so people were coming into Pita Pit to get food, yet somehow it wasn't as chaotic as it could have been.  The wait wasn't long, and the staff inside were friendly. I just wish that Pita Pit was still at home in Maryland."}
{"text":"This place was terrific!  My daughter and I were on our way to Pita Jungle when we saw this place.  I'm not familiar with this part of town and had never heard of Pital Pit.  We decided to go with it over a traditional sit down restaurant - much easier for a three year old.  I'm glad we did.  The food was fresh, delicious and they had tons of options.  Staff was friendly and truly happy we stopped in.  If there was a Pita Pit by my house, I'd eat there all the time.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love the pita sandwiches they make it is sooooo good. I've tried most of the flavors and can't go wrong with it. My favorite is the buffalo chicken and I like it because you can choose what goes inside the pita so everything is made to order which is nice. Chicken caesar is my second favorite. It is nice and filling so it is worth every penny. Great  quick service as well."}
{"text":"The hours say they're open until 10pm. The sign on the door says they're open until 10pm, yet when I showed up at 9:45 the doors were locked and the \"open\" sign was off. When I knocked on the door, out of the three employees inside, only one looked at me and only did so from behind the swinging doors with a smirky grin on his face that basically said, \"yeah right, lady. I'm not opening the doors for you.\" Extremely disappointed, since this WAS one of my favorite places by my office for lunch."}
{"text":"2/25/18 - Did the college bar night and token late night munchies. There was only one guy working - who absolutely killed it dealing with the crowd. Food was amazing -- but above and beyond, he kept his cool while dozens of drunk idiots tried to \"yelp threat\" him to open the locked patron-only restrooms. Dude deserves a medal. 5 stars to the dude working - 1 Star to the manager/owner."}
{"text":"Pita pit is kinda like Subway: it's fast-food, but it doesn't usually leave you feeling sick and remorseful. Most of the ingredients are fresh and healthy (if you avoid the cheese-steak, which is hard to do), so in most cases you can't go wrong with what you order. Most of the sauces, veggies, and meats you're choosing from are actually really healthy, especially if you're sticking to veggies.   I always go with chicken breast, and then I have my pita stuffed with lettuce, tomatoes, peppers, onions, and hot sauce. Other like to add various cheeses and sauces (like greek sauce), with good results.   Important note: this place is open late, so if you're stumbling home from downtown bars, you can grab a late-night snack. That is, if you're willing to wait in a long line with the other party people..."}
{"text":"The Pita Pit will always hold a special place in my heart. :) My first job in college in Oxford, Ohio was at the Pita Pit. I literally ate there every single day and never got sick of the food. I was ecstatic when I found out that they were bringing Pita Pit to North East Ohio! It was like a dream come true!!   You really can't go wrong with anything you order on the menu. The toppings and sauces are unlimited so I pretty much put one of each in my pita. The ingredients are so fresh and the best part is you can add hummus OR guac to your pita AT NO CHARGE!!!!  My favorite is the chicken pita with all the fixings. The secret sauce is the final touch! Once I'm done creating it, It probably weighs at least 3 pounds lol! Forget Subway or Jimmy Johns, Pita Pit is where it's at !!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good; a little confusing set up for me, but I think that's probably a corporate thing vs. a store thing. What I mean, is that  in this type of restaurant, you usually order/build your meal first and pay at the end. Here, you pay first (at the far end from the front door) and then work your way back to the front door.  That being said, the staff was nice, if not a little sleepy, and the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time and don't plan to come again. The 2 stars is for the good service by staff who seemingly tried their best, and the veggies were fresh.  However I would not describe this place as Mediterranean.  Their \"grilled chicken\" was served in tiny pieces (like kibbles I give my small dog), bland and dry, their tzatsiki tasted like flavorless sour cream.  To improve the taste & quality of their food, I would recommend for the owner to compare their grilled chicken with Chipotle, and tzatsiki with Daphne's / Yalla's (SoCal Mediterranean fast food, not sure if they're here in AZ), or Pita Jungle.  Good luck."}
{"text":"For 6$-9$ you get a decent sized pita sandwich/wrap. The Place is Subway Style and with different vegan/Veggie options available for the non meat eaters. Gyro meat,Deli meat and chicken are available (maybe a few other kinds as well). Different kinds of sauces to choose from too. The seating is limited as I guessing it's meant to be primarily a take out place.   Located next to a gym for those wanting something healthy after a workout. (Near Jalapeño Loco)."}
{"text":"Each time I go to pita pit I am never disappointed. I am on the Keto diet and am so glad they have the fork-it option so I can create my own salad. The service is always fast and the area is always clean. I will continue to enjoy the many options they have for salads."}
{"text":"Just got a chicken crave delivered! A+ it was fast, and my order was exact. Plus the delivery girl was cute and friendly. Happy camper here."}
{"text":"I really like how you can add certain toppings at no additional cost, like avocado, roasted red peppers, artichokes, and hummus. They have a variety of sauces that doesn't compare to subway, I chose the jalapeño ranch and it was delicious!   Service is a bit on the slow side, but it's like they say, good things happen to those who wait."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. I get the chicken pita every time i go. This is a great place to get something healthy and at a decent price. I normally go late so parking is not a big deal. Will be back oh and the staff has been friendly every time which is a big plus."}
{"text":"Food is always good and  fresh  Customer service is always on point  My favorite is the Chicken Souvlaki & Chicken Caesar My Husbands favorite is the Philadelphia cheesesteak  I will be back"}
{"text":"Recently found this place because we received a coupon, the pitas are delicious and very light and refreshing. Love the way you pay one price but can pick all the toppings you want, and a great variety. Wednesday is extra meat for only 99¢, normally it's $2, and the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I think they should normally have more meat, but like I said they are light and refreshing the way they are. Will continue to go there, they also deliver!"}
{"text":"The ingredients are always fresh and they always take extra care to make sure it comes out really well-made. Everyone that works there has always been so polite to me. I fucking love this place so much."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is horrifically slow. Like no matter when I come. ITS NOT THAT HARD TO MAKE A PITA. I can't even with this place."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. Would I eat here again? When the need for a gyro or chicken souvlaki hits me... perhaps, if I'm in the area.   It's a chain, as I used to have Pita Pit in college when I attended the University of Nevada in Reno, I know this to be true. I remember being highly addicted to the pitas here based off the fact I could get so many add-ins for no additional money. I could basically stuff my pita so full of romaine lettuce, spinach, banana peppers, mushrooms, cucumbers, and all kinds of tasty sauces I wouldn't have to eat for a whole day because I'd be so full. And that was kind of the point - as a poor college student, paying almost $10 for a combo meal at Pita Pit was like... half my beer budget for happy hour at the bar down the street.   As an adult (heh heh) now, and not a college student, Pita Pit is all right. Even with all the stuffing of veggies I can fit into one of these bad boys it's still just all right. By no means was my chicken souvlaki pita bad, it was good, but I've definitely had better Greek food elsewhere. But again, this is Pita Pit, the chain that also serves a Dagwood pita - so can I really base my opinion off of it while comparing it to actual Greek places that specialize in *Greek* only dishes?   Overall - service was extremely friendly and the guys working here were absolutely fabulous. They accepted my LivingSocial deal quickly and with ease. They were also chatty while making my pita and making me feel welcome. Food - somewhat bland, but it's a chain, so I guess my comparison to more authentic Greek places is somewhat moot. Therefore, Pita Pit is A-OK in my book. Check them out if you're in the UNLV area, at least you will feel good stuffing your pita with lots of good greens and veggies in the end!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken breast pita,  while I enjoyed the choice of fixings,  they were skimpy with the chicken.  The veggies were fresh,  the chicken was good,  just not enough of it.  Wasn't fond of the pita bread either"}
{"text":"I've only eaten at The Pita Pit during late night trips after the bars, so my recollection is a little fuzzy at times. But from what I can remember,  the food will satisfy your late night hunger.  After last call, this place is always packed out. They stay open till the wee hours of the morning so you can grab yourself some grub after your late night of partying. The line moves pretty fast, so don't worry if it's out the door when you get there.  If you've never been here before, it's basically like Subway, just with pitas. You order your base pita, then add the toppings you want. While the food is pretty tasty, it really isn't something I'd absolutely crave for. It may be one of the healthier late night options for food though, so I have to give it some credit there. If you like greasiness, then you won't find it at The Pita Pit. Also, consider getting 2 pitas because 1 really won't fill you up, but maybe that's just me.  So The Pita Pit is 1 of several options you'll have if you're late night food searching in downtown Charlotte, & it's probably one of the healthier choices. Prepare to wait in line though & think about ordering more than 1 pita for yourself."}
{"text":"I reviewed the Strongsville location so I decided to give Fairview Park a try.  This time I ordered \"Meat the day\".  I think this is my new favorite!  It has bacon, ham, eggs and hasbrowns grilled on the flat top grill plus I got double meat and had them grill onions and green peppers as well.  This thing was massive!  I had them put pepper jack cheese, ranch dressing and little bit of hot sauce.  I may go back for dinner!  I have read other reviews about this location and many have mentioned \"Mediterranean\" I would not class it as that.  More of a sandwich shop with much better options!"}
{"text":"I had a terrible delivery experience the other day. First, it took them more then one hour to deliver a simple pita and a smoothie. So, they were busy, I get it. However, they couldn't even get my order right. I ended up getting something I didn't even order. If it tasted well, then at least I would have been okay, I'm not complicated really. But nooo!!! It was soggy and so full of onions. Then, I ordered a smoothie and It was already half melted like a hybrid between juice and a smoothie ( probably because it took so long to get me) and the driver didn't even give me a straw!! I just gave then an extra star because I had a previously good delivery experience. I was so disappointed, I wanted to get a refund. I don't think I'll be ordering from this Pita Pit again."}
{"text":"I submitted an online order at 11:30 for a 12:22 pickup time. When I arrived pitas we're not ready and the girl behind the counter hadn't even pulled them off the printer yet. She says can you make this Quick to the guy assembling the pitas who looked stoned off his ass. So we wait another 15 minutes still no pitas, finally we get our pitas after watching 4 people fumble over themselves trying to figure out how to handle 5 customers at once. By this time I had to get the pita to go to not be late back from my lunch so I had no idea if they made it correctly, and of course it wasn't, it had no cheese, no sauce, and the chicken was tough. To add onto the experience both my girlfriend and I got sick, wonderful! Is it really that hard to check the printer to see if any online orders came through and just read what's on the paper to make them correctly?"}
{"text":"This place didn't strike me as a food choice when first walking into the spot ...and had me more questionable when I noticed the small menu ... but when I got the Mediterranean chicken it was so awesome... I had the whole wheat Pita and the meat was delish...this undercover Food Pirate would make a second trip here."}
{"text":"I had my first experience with Pita  Pit in Valencia CA and I was so excited to see that we had one in Vegas.  The staff at the Silverado Ranch shop are very friendly and the pitas are just so fresh and delicious!  The set up is similar to Subway but the main difference is that you get a hot pita with so much more meat.  In addition to Subway's selection of veggies, they also have artichoke hearts, corn, a bigger selection of cheese and 2 different types of lettuce to choose from (I love romaine) and much much more.  Great selection of sauces too. Yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is a very solid lunch spot. Quick, priced right, friendly staff, lots of choices. Big fan!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this location 5 stars for the following reasons: There was only one guy working all by himself on a crazy Saturday night... He dealt with so many drunk idiots, including a girl that demanded getting into the rest room that wasn't even dining. This girl was so obnoxious, she was threatening the employee, as well as customers. This guy rang in customers, and made their food. I felt so bad for him. I could never deal with what he was dealing with last night. Pita Pit management/owners really need to put on another employee at night on the weekends. No one person should have to deal with what that guy dealt with last night. 5 star employee for sure!"}
{"text":"So they are brand new and clearly unsure of what they are doing. No big deal they were friendly and trying to do the best they could. I ordered the buffalo chicken pita and had it customized because I didn't care of some of the suggested ingredients. The buffalo sauce has a hint of BBQ sauce taste and I hate the taste of BBQ. I ate about a quarter of it and had to be done. I got the berry berry smoothie which was delicious so I at least have that. I will try again just maybe something different next time."}
{"text":"Super excited to have a quick meal option in downtown Cornelius.  I enjoy the souvlaki, gyro & philly steak...all very good.  You get to be creative with your fillings, so pick your favorite base and change up your fillings to make a different pita every time.    If there is a line (especially at lunch), don't worry, it goes fairly quick.  It's going to be faster than any other place around .  You can order online and/or opt for delivery too.    How it works... Order and pay, they get your grill items started then step up to one of the two counters to select your pita & fillings.  Be kind to your pita maker.  Enjoy your pita, on the patio, if it's a nice day!"}
{"text":"Recently had a breakfast Pita on a Sunday.  The breakfast pita was a lower price than the pitas I usually get for lunch so that was a nice surprise.  I think it contained 6 pieces of bacon, which also exceeded my expecations and, of course, as many veggies as I wanted.  The two girls working that day were very friendly.  Also easy to park downtown on a Sunday.  I will add the Pita Pit as a usual brunch spot and not have to worry about time since breakfast pitas are served all day."}
{"text":"Pita Pit is a solid franchise pumping out consistent product in every location I've been too. Just like this one.  Been to this one a few times as it's located next door to my client's office.   There is no seating inside. You come in, place an order, wait a bit while they roll your pita, and back you go to the office. In and out in 5 minutes.   The staff are attentive the needs of customers. When I ordered a falafel, they asked me if I was a vegetarian (I am not) and if it would be okay to throw mine on the grill (that's the only way I like it, no microwave, please).  BTW, if you ARE a vegetarian, they have half a dozen options for you, which if pretty cool. Other options include chicken, beef, and gyros (lamb).  A great place to grab a quick lunch that you can take back to your desk but not a place you'd go to with someone else to have a conversation over a meal.   There is some street parking available (paid). The lots are scarce in the area and keep disappearing as new condo buildings are being built around."}
{"text":"I don't show as checked in here nearly as often as I go because by the time in my night when I get to Pita Pit my phone is on ultra-please-please-please-don't-die mode.  Pita Pit is my favorite post drinking location in Charlotte. It has that special combination of things I desire after a night on the town - delicious food, served quickly, plenty of options and the ability to pretend I am being healthy. Throwing some spinach in my drunk munchies food totally negates all the beers I had earlier, right? I love it here so much I will walk all those blocks from the Epicentre in those shoes I was never going to wear again to get my fix.  The night shift here is phenomenal. Last time I went I didn't remember the name of the previous pita special I had but a brief description and they were able to figure it out assemble it in a couple minutes. The food here is always fresh and I love how many options you have. They freshly grill your protein selection in front of you and add the veggie options as you request. Every flavor combo I have tried has come out delicious.   I wish Pita Pit had more locations in Charlotte, or would deliver out to the boonies where I live. If you find yourself in the city, especially after a bar or two, I would highly recommend a stop here."}
{"text":"Used to live in Madison and really liked this Pita Pit. They recently changed owners and it got even better. Not much else to say, except that I recommend it! They deliver too."}
{"text":"Pita Pit is my lunch of choice when I am too lazy or crazed to bring in my own food for the work day. The interior is clean, the food is fresh, and the service is always friendly.   Now if you are heading over there during the work week, be sure to take note that this place is PACKED between the hours of 11am-1pm. Everyday. The line moves quickly, but you'll probably get jostled around a bit before ordering your pita. And if you don't work uptown, I imagine parking can be a big hassle, so this might not be the most convenient.  I always order the hummus wheat pita. It's delicious and they cram a ton of veggies into it (I literally choose almost every veggie they have, plus avocado, and there are no additional charges). The pita ends up being so large that I eat half for lunch and then save the other half for dinner. Two meals for around $6.00 is an awesome deal!"}
{"text":"The location was Johnnie's Chicago Red Hots (and if you read Jon Talton's High Country Nocturne it was a secret FBI office for a short while) but now it's a Pita Pit.  They had a booth at this year's Willo Home Tour and were giving out coupons.  You can order online and specify in detail what you want in your pita.  The coupon claimed to work online but it didn't.  The restaurant did honor it when I brought it in though.  The place is more or less a Subway for pitas.  The pitas are huge, very generous with the veggies.  They're thin though and more like a crepe than a pita.  Definitely worth going back, although I'm going to have to tweak the ingredients to get the taste right.  There is so much flexibility in what you can ask for that it is not difficult to come up with a bad combination."}
{"text":"Love Pita Pits! Used to have one back home but they sadly closed down and hadn't eaten here in years ! Coming back the menu was basically the same, no complaints from me! I always either get the gyros or chicken Caesar , both are amazing. Love it."}
{"text":"The Pitas are good here and prices super cheap. It good for a quick lunch or dinner on the run. Nothing fancy but I consider it the \"subway\" for Pitas. Stay out of the bathroom though! It was so dirty and smelly when I was here. Go somewhere unless unless it is an emergency!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I went into Pita Pit with a negative bias because of my wife.  I had never eaten there but she had several times years before and had a negative view from a bad experience or two.  Oddly enough, the first time I went it was with her on her suggestion.  I actually really liked it - the first time and every time since.    Why the 4 stars?  I always get the veggie options like hummus.  These wraps.. er pitas, are less pricey than the other meat based versions.  The meaty ones seem a little overpriced so I ding them a star.  But I'll take the low priced veggie option every time because they are delicious.  Plus, was there last week and the music, which I guessed was playing from Pandora, was exactly like my channel.  Not that I want everything to be exactly like me, but if we agree in music, we probably agree with food.   And eating my delicious hummus pita with good music playing made me happy."}
{"text":"Not a lot of flavor from any of the three different pita's we ordered. ( I ordered the buffalo pita ) Plus, the major issue was the chicken bone fragment that cut the inside of my wife's mouth from the chicken pita she ordered.....  Not impressed with this place at all.... probably will not go to pita pit again."}
{"text":"This place was so disappointing! Having never been to one, maybe I had my expectations way too high. I ordered the regular size souvlaki chicken pita, I couldn't tell you even what the chicken tasted like because the amount of meat was so small I could barely taste it (think toddler size portion of meat) I can't imagine how little would be in the small pita. Going through the line First thing I notice is how brown the iceberg lettuce was... toxic looking. The girl making our pitas was wearing gloves but kept touching her face, hair and glasses with them on while making the wraps, which I thought was really unappetizing. We ended up spending $45 for 4 sub combo meals that tasted bland- don't think we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I forget that Pita Pit always pisses me off and I go back there and then a few visits later, they remind me. Ostensibly they should be vegetarian friendly, but they will occasionally put grilled meat all over their work space and then drag my vegetarian pita through it, causing me to have to throw it away and waste money and food (and I get that eating out is always dicey, but this is pretty egregious when it happens). Today it was the other thing that annoys me, when I get a vegetarian pita and they give me only minimal vegetables. Here it is two hours later and I am starving because the dude filled the pita as though the veggies were a condiment to a meat, except there is no meat in my pita. With just a few tweaks they could be awesome, but they mess up the little details."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food and would never have thought I would ever prefer a chain to many locally owned spots, but Pita Pit ROCKS!!  I always get the gyro and it's always wonderful. I love how much you can add (hummus, avocado, etc) without paying an additional fee. This sandwich is so freaking perfect I could eat it for 3 meals a day. The meat is cooked right. The veggies are plentiful. Most importantly, the name doesn't lie, the PITA is fluffy and yummy and perfect even while toasted.  Ordering delivery? PP is one of the fastest places in town. Hungry after a night out on state street? It's open late. The staff is so friendly and make it look like they actually enjoy working there.  I even got a $5 pita from using the Hooked app!"}
{"text":"Great addition to Cornelius!  The restaurant is extremely clean and has a very friendly atmosphere.  I ordered the buffalo chicken pita which was very tasty.  The staff was very friendly and the customer service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Whhhyyyy is Pita Pit not closer to my work location??????  Every now and then I have a Pita Pit craving and make the truck over to first ward.  The good news with that is that at least I'm getting my steps in....  I love that Pita Pit publishes all of their nutrition for the days I'm tying to be healthy.    You honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  I usually get the turkey Pita.  The Pita Pit team heats up the meat on the grill as you order all of the delicious fillers you want in your wrap.  At the end of the filling station there is a section with every sauce you can imagine.    The line moves really quickly.  They have a rewards program that quickly adds up over time for freebies.  Pita pit is a good late night place to go after a fun night uptown too.  Back when I was younger this was one of my go to places."}
{"text":"Yay, finally a pita pit in Cleveland! You really can't go wrong here, they have every ingredient you could imagine for you to choose from and roll into your pita. Since I'm a veg head I always go for the falafel and love getting to make it my own. I always feel a little better about getting fast food here since they make it right in front of you... Probably not super healthy but it seems like it!"}
{"text":"Love the vegan options! Love the spicy options!  They are super  friendly here and also helpful.  Food was delicious.  NOT subway.  Ingredients are MUCH better quality and more variety.  Also 100-200 calories less than Subway.  Gross!  Pita Pit is SOOOOOOOOOO good!"}
{"text":"I agree with some of the other reviewers, it is a lot like Subway.  But I am partial to pita bread and subway so it was all good.  We sat outside and ate while listening to a musician who happened to be playing in the courtyard.  I would suggest not getting the meal combo which included chips, we did, and could not eat the chips because the pita was filling enough on it's own.   We will be going back."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. Both times was greeted with a smile. Staff was friendly and explained about the menu and different choices. Kind of like a Subway where u choose what to put inside the pita. Food was actually very good. Definitely one of my places to go eat at."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Pita Pit even though they are part of a chain.  We are fortunate enough to live near a mom and pop place that makes fresh pitas and we usually go there but we were in the area and decided to give Pita Pit a try.  I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised.  My husband got the Mediterranean Chicken pita and I got the Caesar Chicken Pita.  I liked how you could pick your toppings.  They were wall fresh and the chicken was cooked fresh.  The way the ingredients to in and the way the sauce is put in makes it where you get all of your ingredients in every bite.  The staff was super nice and even gave me a bowl of water for my dog.  We took advantage of the outdoor tables and enjoyed a nice lunch."}
{"text":"Creative but as flavor goes, nothing out of this world unfortunately. Conveniently right across from the Greenspun Hall, the place is cosy. It's like a subway with pitas. I ordered a gyro pita. The gyro meat is not sliced fresh, it looked like they threw a few pieces of rubber on the grill and chopped it up. The actual pita was really thin, not the thick pitas you are usually used to. They do have the option between white or wheat pitas. Just like subway, you pick what ever toppings you want. I choose lettuce, tomatoes, onions, feta cheese, a smear of hummus and tzatsiki sauce. The hummus was gritty like sand, kinda nasty. The tzatsiki was thick but it needed salt and more cucumber, it was pretty much just yogurt. The gyro meat actually had some flavor but it wasn't crunchy and juicy it was oily and soggy. I don't even think it was real gyro meat, sadly enough. For just the sandwich it was close to $8 which was not worth the price at all! I'd eat it again if it was like $5, maybe. They do offer a rewards program, you earn points for every dollar spent but you need like 90 points for a free pita sandwich and I highly doubt I'll ever eat here again. I'm going to go try Stefano's in the same plaza when I crave a gyro again."}
{"text":"Love this place! We make it in most weekends. The employees always have big smiles and GREAT service."}
{"text":"Just ok."}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick and healthy lunch. Their ingredients always look nice and fresh. My fav is the spicy black bean pita. I probably come here about twice a week before work. Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"First off, this place is SPOTLESS. Definitely the cleanest restaurant I've seen in a long time. The owner was there and let us use two coupons at once, score! You chose your meat, wheat or white pita, and a plethora of yummy toppings. The meat is cooked fresh right in front of you after you order. Food was delicious. I had a gyro and my husband had the Philly cheesesteak. The coolest part for me was the drink machine - they have one of those touch screen drink dispensers with about 100 different choices. Loved it. We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"The people who work the late shift here deserve a medal. Or holiday. Or the biggest hug ever. Seriously, how would you feel if you were at work and an army of blackout drunk people stormed into your office? They deal with it every Friday and Saturday night.  I'll be honest... I'm usually not sober when I end up here. I'll make fun of the other drunk people and act like I'm completely fine. I dunno if anyone buys it.  My go-to order is the buffalo chicken loaded with some type of combination of mushrooms, jalapenos, banana peppers, insert whatever veggie I'm feeling and a bunch of tzatziki.   I usually take it to go so I can eat it at home in pajamas. However, if you can snag a seat sit and stay for the show of the endless parade of the inebriated.  I have to give props to the workers here. They handle it all in stride and are pretty good sports about everything. Don't be discouraged by a long line. Pita Pit can pump orders pretty quickly so they wait is never all that long. If you want to avoid the madness, make sure you get here before 2am to get there before the rush."}
{"text":"Ordered the falafel pita and fell in love. I normally only eat at Paymons for the last 18 years but live across the street from pita pit. I was so happy the flavours were awesome and so many choices. The flavors and texture were amazing for a falafel. They are normally so dry and fall apart after one bite. This falafel stayed soft for hours because the portion was so big I was able to eat it for two meals. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Like many others have said Pita Pit is kinda like the Subway of Pitas and perhaps they're right. It's a very familiar feeling once inside a Pita Pit aside from the decor BUT is this necessarily a bad thing? I say no not at all! The menu isn't exactly overwhelming with choices  but there is some variety and I kind of like the simplicity. That being said I've had nothing but good experiences here. Cleanliness, check. Freshness, check. Fast and friendly service, check. A big fat pita bursting at the seams with greatness, BIG CHECK! Everything that matters most checks all the right boxes for me.   The one thing I do really enjoy at Pita Pit is how fresh all the extra little goodies are that they have packed into that perfectly warmed up pita and I appreciate that!!(thanks Pita Pit). By the time my pita is done I'm always convinced the guy(or gal) making it won't be able to roll all that goodness up without splitting that thing right down the middle but somehow they do!!:) I do tend to try and eat on the cleaner side and it's totally not a problem here so get your rear end down to the Pita Pit and try em out! Cheers!"}
{"text":"So happy I bought my LivingSocial deal here! Lots of positives and negatives though.  This Pita Pit is extremely clean and has a lot of options. Though it's not \"expensive\" I found that the pita's here didn't fill me up.   I was not a fan of the the person at the register, who was making the pitas while simultaneously taking orders, not sanitary.   I found that this Pita Pit doesn't have a great system because people are crowding around at the fillings waiting/trying to tell the employee what they want in their pita in a very small area. The \"restaurant\" needs to be more spread out and not have everything clumped together."}
{"text":"I just got home to enjoy our Pitas and I'm a little critical. I think the kid helping me was sweet, but maybe needs a bit more training. Very nice kid though! The gyro meat needs to be cooked more. It's waaaaay too mushy. Just let it sear a bit and it would be great. The romaine was a bit wilted and missing the crunch, but that's an easy fix! . I love the flavor of the pita, and the whole concept. I'll definitely be back to try more things. Everyone behind the counter was friendly and very personable and in a city of customer service industry people- super important!"}
{"text":"This has the potential to be great but the pita felt lacking in taste and freshness...mediocre is the best way to describe pita pit"}
{"text":"Service was top notch. Very friendly staff and engaging. 5 stars there.   Food wise it was real good! I thinks it a touch expense for what you are getting. But I would go again. Quesapita was real real good, but for 5 bucks is a tad expensive."}
{"text":"friendly, clean, talkative, appreciative of my business. Great experience for sure! So glad they moved in to mentor!!!!"}
{"text":"This place should not be able to call itself Mediterranean at all. Frozen gyro slices and even frozen deli turkey slices. Meat was not cooked all the way through (like a microwaved burrito where it was still a little frozen in the middle). Oh, and where are the plates? Service was strange, putting it kindly. Would definitely not eat here again. Blegh!"}
{"text":"Ordered using UberEATS. Thank you for participating.   Food smelled great when we opened the bag. I had the buffalo chicken and I threw a couple veggies on that were nice and crunchy. The chicken was flavorful and the buffalo sauce was even a bit spicy. I would order this again.   We also had a hummus pita and loaded it with veggies. Once again, they were delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome food & outstanding service. I was skeptical (food chains) but my hummus pita was SO good. I called in my order as I returned from a hike. It was around 12:30, a busy lunch hour. The woman who took my call did not make me feel rushed & explained the menu options. When I picked it up, they were very busy but so accommodating! Definitely will return. Inside is a bit small but nice, roomy patio outside. Really is a great place. Affordable and delicious!!"}
{"text":"I work down the street, so when I do order food, this is usually my go to. It's one of the few places that I haven't yet had a bad experience with. Fresh ingredients, delicious combinations, and they deliver!"}
{"text":"First time here. My pita sandwich was TASTY!!! Got the Buffalo chicken: All the hot veggies, more buffalo sauce and the jalapeño ranch. Bomb diggity. Good service. Pretty clean inside. Would visit again to try different sandwich flavors. My friend had the salad which looked good. I think you get more in the pita though. Price seems affordable and comparable to other places."}
{"text":"Ask for the double chicken. It's the best. They pile on the toppings. I love it. Great post workout meal! Perhaps a tip may be to provide a value card for folks! I frequent the place and wouldn't mind receiving a free pita here and there! Overall, great shop!"}
{"text":"The staff here sucks. I've been in to this place twice and the first time I went to use a Hooked deal and the guy behind the counter literally laughed out loud at me and said that only college students use that app and their deals. Pretty rude behavior as there was a line of people to order. Everyone was looking at me for wanting to use a deal to try their food out. My plan was to try them out and use them often if the food was good.  The second time I was in, we ordered our meals and then grabbed a seat by the window. The guy behind the counter yells at us in complete disgust (in front of 15 people) to get back in line. The other people in line were so shocked at his behavior that they even said he was so rude. The thought of getting scolded by a restaurant employee is so shocking to me that I will not be back. And, I've now shared my horrible experiences with others in hopes that they don't have the same thing happen.  oh, the food? it's nothing to rave about. pretty so-so in Madison terms. There are a bunch of other places nearby to eat that are way better. The veggies were a bit (brown/past their prime) both times I went, and the chicken (1 time) was gristly and inedible."}
{"text":"Yum. Just yum!  Had a Greek inspired salad with lots of fresh greens, super fresh and flavorful chicken, banana peppers and tzatziki. I love that you get to order then customize your ingredients. The staff was very nice and my daughter enjoyed her kid's quesadilla as well. I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Nice lite lunch, walked in was told hello and thank you for coming. Very nice ;),  Was helped on what I wanted , got the run down on what people like and what I may like - went with a steak pita.  Helped me with toppings.  Only thing is the drink size, but that's very small . good guy there helped me and I will try to get back."}
{"text":"So happy a healthy food alternative replaced a Cold Stone Creamery!!  I tried this place for the first time a couple weeks ago when they just opened. Great friendly staff and great menu selections. I had the Local Pita - delish!  Very happy there is a quick healthy to go food place close to home!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for an affordable caterer to make fresh, tasty food for a work function. Pita Pit really was helpful and accommodating. They even let me pick up the three trays of pita sandwiches before their opening time of 10am. The food was really good and the wraps stayed fresh and never got soggy. Everything was delicious and someone even commented on the unique bell pepper filled with humus accompanied by pita bread. The food was presented well and the 15% off 1st catering order was great too! Thank you Anna & Rachelle for really a great job!"}
{"text":"Giving it a one star because I can't go lower than this. First off, the guy with the long blond hair who works there was so rude. I've never in my entire life seen such disregard for the food he was preparing and for the customers he serves. He threw the food into my pita bread with so much aggression that he splattered the food all over the other open containers. Talk about food contamination! At one point he took too many cheese slices and threw the other piece over his shoulders behind him. Needless to say that there are cheese slices on the floor. The smoothie counter was a mess. Absolutely disgusting!   Between making my pita and that of my friend, he kept screaming orders to his soft spoken co-worker, who was in the back.  At the end when I asked for a bag to carry the pitas, he took a leftover pita bread bag (full of crumbs) and threw it right at me. It was just baffling.  My friend and I will NEVER EVER come back here again!!!"}
{"text":"Very similar feel to subway but with pita bread. Good variety of pita options. I got the caesar chicken with bacon on wheat pita. It tasted great! Would get it again. Left a little hungry even with a bag of chips. Wish it were at a bigger portion, but I probably don't need to eat more than I did. Super glad they had my favorite flavor of Sunchips. The dark red bag. Seems to be a unicorn in sandwich shops. Had the new soda machine with ton of options. Service was good. Place was clean."}
{"text":"I've always driven by this place and never gave it much thought, but after trying this place I think I'll stop here more often, the wraps are very fresh and you can add whatever you like to it, it reminded me of any sand which place like Subway or Quiznos but for wraps, workers are very nice and are very helpful during my first time there. I would definitely come here more often."}
{"text":"The cute guy is gone.....the new male employee is not cute but he's friendly to the customers, which is important."}
{"text":"The pitas are yummy. The grilled chicken is not dry and perfectly seasoned. The veggies are fresh with av good variety. The tzaziki is excellent. The pita was fresh and not stale. I love that their website has nutrition information. The staff was Johnny on the spot and friendly. Good prices.We will be back!"}
{"text":"Such a yummy sandwich shop, very quick and open late (for those drunk nights)."}
{"text":"Can you say wow!? This is one of the only fast preparation sandwich places I have been to that actually has an impressive spread for sandwich condiments. Yeah you may pay $8-10 dollars for a combo, but they definitely give you your money's worth. You can add hummus and Avocado to your sandwich for no extra charge. They also have tons of dressings including tzatziki sauce! Oh yeah! Wish there was more pita pits in the suburban areas surrounding Uptown Charlotte like Concord, Harrisburg or the University area."}
{"text":"Abominable. The worst thing I have been served in ages. That gummy mass of tasteless spooge is not a pita. Disgusting. The gyro had no meat. Ok. A few specs that tasted ok on their own. Magnify them by 10, maybe. They are still wrapped in something that tastes like a sponge mop. Then there is some spinach. And the sauce. Not sauce. No flavor. Just crappy yogurt. Need salt? Pepper? Nope. They don't have any for customers. The souvlaki was equally crap. Ordered as a \"salad,\" without the pita, same price, same bland taste. Of course, you don't get the deplorable pita. That's a bonus. Still sucks. Everything about the food was dreadful."}
{"text":"Boy, in the night time, the stores in the area are closed with limited options. This place stays open until 11p. That was quite a find. Had the Souvlaki Pita and it was really good. Had a number of sauces and toppings (covered by the pita option already). Staff is very attentive, polite, and stays smiling through the last hour. A definite plus for staff and food accessibility plus tastiness."}
{"text":"So nice to have a healthy, quick place to grab a bite to eat! Great menu, friendly people. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Called in an order for delivery these stoners couldn't even talk straight. Sent their friend who doesn't even work for the company to deliver it. The Coke was half draken when it got here an hour and 15 minutes later. Dude tried walking off with my 20 saying he didn't have change. Stay in college people."}
{"text":"Healthy, tasty food??  To bad I can fill one of these babies to the size of a chipotle burrito full of free toppings. Nom. And then eat 2 of them.  $2 to deliver, get it!"}
{"text":"Richard is freaking awesome! Walked in after 2 weeks and he remembered me and knew what I wanted. Stevie, his trusted side kick made the best Gyro ever. Thanks guys. I will tell all my friends about you and the awesomeness that it's Pita Pit on Greenfield South of the 60 in the Wal-Mart parking lot."}
{"text":"Was pretty disappointed. I had the gyro (bad mistake on my part) and it tasted really bland. I do like the fact that they have a lot more toppings and more healthy options for both vegetarians & meat lovers than Subway, but the prices are too expensive."}
{"text":"Giving this place a conservative three stars, but has the makings of four stars.  I will give this place a temporary spot on the lunch rotation when uptown.    Came here to grab a quick lunch with a buddy who works uptown to talk shop.  I grabbed a pita and buddy grabbed the salad.  Salad was insanely huge with everything possible.  My pita was considerably smaller but tasty as well.  I recommend the Grecian, if it's still a special that's up there.  Tip:  I would try to avoid this place around 12PM because it became insanely packed.  To be fair, it looked like they did a good job of moving people in and out of there, but I didn't really pay too much attention.  Looking forward to returning here after a late night of drank.  dmo out."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a quick, healthyish dinner before heading to the movies and Pita Pit was my choice for the night. I wasn't really aware that this location existed, probably because it's hard to spot in this particular plaza and is kind of tucked away in the middle.   We came in on a Tuesday night and there were a couple guys that were having their pitas made, but no one in line to order. I tend to get the exact same thing every single time I go to Pita Pit because its guaranteed amazing and I know I'll like it. I ordered a Chicken Caesar pita and a drink, and I guess they had some kind of promotion going on because if you threw a ball into a net on the wall, you got a drink for free! Clearly I suck at basketball cause I didn't win. Anyways...  The girl behind the cash was very friendly and fast and we headed down to the other end to watch my pita being made. The girl who was doing the cooking was chatty and very nice and while we stood around watching my chicken and bacon cook, we munched on some of the pita chips and dipping sauce they had out. Loved this! I've never seen it at another pita pit but I got to try some of their new sauces, which were yum!   I've been to other Pita places (even other Pita Pits) where they're stingy as hell with the toppings. I'm not paying $8 for a pita with nothing in it - I'm paying for the meat AND the toppings. No issues at this location! The girl asked what I wanted and asked how much \"stuff\" i'd be putting in because the romaine lettuce was the hardest to get into the pita and if I was piling stuff on, she'd put less so everything else fit. Another thing I've never seen before were seasonings to put right onto the meat on the grill! I added Garlic Plus seasoning to my chicken, they had a whole bunch of them, but never seen that before! I picked out my toppings and she put it all together and we were done! And a yummy pita it was!!   Overall, you can't go wrong with this location. Super clean, very large and a great selection of fresh toppings, sauces and seasonings. The staff here were so very nice that I'd come back just for that aspect, as the Pita Zone near me has staff that behave weirdly. I'm glad I was able to find another Pita Pit not too far from home because I'll be coming here from now on for all my Pita needs!"}
{"text":"Rachel O was amazing with helping me with my take out experience. This was my first time at a pita jungle and i couldnt ask for a better first time experience!"}
{"text":"Lunch today was bad! I ordered a regular falafel and was the least to say surprised at the quantity of the food for the amount i paid. The server put like not even a teaspoon of hummus on the pita. And even after i told him to add some more, he added probably 1gram of it. The vegetables added were again in the same minimal quantity! Not coming back here again!! Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'll take it from the top. You walk in and you're immediately greeted by a lovely and friendly welcoming staff with smiling faces. You see a bar of toppings consisting of a plethora of tasty options. The setup at Pita Pit kind of resembles a hybrid of a Subway, Dolce Wraps and Chipotle if they were to be conjoined. The meats were cooked fresh on a flat top grill reminding me of chipotle. They kind of have some Mediterranean type options reminding me of Dolce Wraps. Then you have the veggie and sauce bar reminding me of Subway but with much better options with plenty of variety. With that being said I like Pita Pit better than all 3 but you can't beat the stir fry at Dolce Wraps and you won't find it at Pita Pit. I highly recommend the Ancho Chipotle sauce if you don't mind a little zing to your zang but there are tons of others to choose from. So head over, jump into the Pit and create your own Pita. I think you'll like what you taste."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good pita sandwich! I got the souvlaki, and was amazed how delicious and filling it was. Maybe I'll edit my review after a few more visits in the future."}
{"text":"Before I discovered Pita Pit, I used to be a regular at Subway since it was the only convenient vegan/vegetarian option I thought was around, especially at UNLV. After coming here I have completely RENOUNCED Subway.  Actually, the fact that Pita Pit and Subway both exist at the same time kind of confuses and angers me.   Pita Pit gives you WAY more options & variety, and their ingredients are so much fresher. You can add avocado, hummus, tzaziki for no extra cost.  They freshly prepare their meats on a grill right in front of you. They have a vegan section of the menu, and I always order the black bean pita which I always stuff full of ingredients until it's really huge. I've taken plenty of non-vegetarians here and they love it. Every time.   What really gets to me is that it COSTS about the SAME as Subway. Especially since Subway hiked up their prices. Blows my mind."}
{"text":"I think this place is terrific! I agree with the person who noted how nice it is to actually have the owner engage them in conversation- that adds so much to the experience and makes customers feel appreciated. I read another review that said something about Chatty Cathy-  to that person I say if you want  your food fast with no customer experience and delivered by a person who doesn't care, perhaps he should try McDonald's!  I think this place is great!"}
{"text":"- Good hours of operation. - Pretty good quality of food. (some meats looks like pre-packaged Oscar Myers deli meat from a grocery store) - Quick lines - Menu isn't too much where you're spending as much time reading as you would eating. - About 6 tables - A lot of toppings - As another person stated... They are NOT really Pita's as you may think but more so a Large Pita sliced open and stuffed."}
{"text":"Called this morning around 11 am CT and asked to speak to a manager. Was greeted very rudely over the phone by one of your employees, who would not tell me when a manager would be in and eventually told me to \"fuck off.\"  The reason why I was asking for a manager was because it was a business call. And being that it was a business call, I have a beautiful recording of the interaction. I'll be sure to send that over to your corporate office."}
{"text":"I have been here at least four times over the past few years.  For lunch and dinner, it is a nice alternative to a sit down restaurant in the downtown area. At 2:30 in the morning as a late night meal to absorb the alcohol and dull the intensity of the next day's hangover, it is truly a gift from the gods.  It is a pretty funny sight to watch at 2:30 on a Saturday or Sunday morning where scores of highly intoxicated people are waiting in line for some of this greek goodness. Normally, a situation like this could be a recipe for disaster as people tend to be a little impatient when they are drinking, but everyone behaves themselves while they are waiting in line because they realize that the wait is worth it and they don't want to be asked to leave or lose their place in line.   I personally recommend the Philly Cheese Steak Pita as it is definitely my go to option and has never disappointed me.  It is really hard to convey how awesome it is that a place with this high quality of food is open this late into the night/ early morning.  It definitely does the job and provides a much needed alternative to another late night dining option known to some as Crap in the Box."}
{"text":"Amazing food and beyond the best customer service I've had since ive been in Tempe by a man named Ryan. They've gained a new loyal customer."}
{"text":"Awesome place! I'm a regular here.. Not only are the servings a good amount but the customer service is great. I always leave feeling so full.. Worth spending that 8-12 dollars for a pita!"}
{"text":"Awesome concept! Great service, super quality, and  very clean! Thanks Hannah & crew! You won me over!"}
{"text":"This location is so dope. The staff is uniformly kind, knowledgeable, funny and it always feels like talking with friends. We came in just before 3 (which I guess is their new happy hour start time!) and we got our pitas for $5 and $2 scratch smoothies. Never any complaints about the location or food, always a great spot!"}
{"text":"Great healthy option for a quick meal.  This location in general has great service (except for one server that seems to not like her job very much but after I frequented a few times, she seems to have warmed up a bit).  The salad option is also great tasting if you're looking to skip the pita for a meal.  This location is always clean and not too busy except during the high school lunch hours.   I even use their app and they have specials sometimes if you put $ into your card/app, you get some discounts."}
{"text":"I like Pita Pit enough.  I don't LOVE Pita Pit.  I don't really know why.  The food was okay, the service was slow but friendly... it wasn't bad or anything... but it just didn't \"do it for me.\"  I don't really have the motivation to try different things.  I got a falafel pita, which was okay.  I would probably like something else better, but... meh.  I'm just not feeling it.  I almost feel bad, because for once, I'm lacking any explanation for it!  I just don't get it."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  I've been to this place twice. The first time they opened about 20 mins late (which seems to be the norm because I had passed by at another time to find them not open when their sign says they should be). The food was fine, but the staff seemed to care less about my business. On my most recent visit there was no one upfront to give my order to when I arrived until some other customers raised their voice to let them know they had another customer. The girls working, once again, seemed to care less about my business and made it seem as though I was bothering them by giving them my order. Quite frankly, Subway's staff seems to know how to create a positive experience. I think I will spend my money where the people appreciate their customers."}
{"text":"I've been going to Pita Pit since I was a kid in SD and a weekly regular in college in Sacramento so to finally see this in Vegas makes me so excited. The chicken crave is my go to pita and was delicious as always. Service lacked a little, otherwise it would have been 5 stars."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to pita pit. I had the prime rib pita. It was very good. The set up is similar to Chipotle but with more options and it's in a pita. The restaurant is clean, the staff is friendly and they are fast. The only complaint was the place reeked of natural gas like they had a major gas leak. I'll return if the place hasn't exploded."}
{"text":"This little deli type restaurant is hidden off 74, I was sort of optimistic when I first walked in because I saw the bar of veggies spread out like subway; but much to my surprise it was delish! The gyro was great and the broccoli soup tastes homemade! The two teens that were working were super nice and answered all of our questions. Price was average, our bill was $20 for two combo meals and one kids meal! Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place used to be great and is now a sh*t show. Should have know when I walked in today and there was no one in there, usually there's a lineup. The girl behind the cash charged me the wrong price for my wrap - $9 after tax for a small chicken.  Then proceeded to put about 5 small cubes of it onto my wrap and grill it for about 30 seconds.  What a rip!! they must be under new management or something, cuz the man who used to work there and maybe own it did a great job and it was bustling gangbusters.  not anymore. AVOID!!"}
{"text":"I tried the new Pita Pit in Indian Trail today and it was pretty tasty.  It is great to have a healthy choice that is quick and easy.  The staff was friendly and the food was fresh and tasty.  There was a daily special, but I had the Chicken Caesar with bacon and it was only 350 calories with 9 grams of Fat.   There is a nice seating area outside where you can eat, I wish they had a larger inside area, there were only 3 or 4 tables inside, and when the hot weather comes, it would be nice to have a little more space.  BUT, with the new park opening soon, it would be great to get takeout and head to the park with the kids!  This is a great addition to the community."}
{"text":"Yes, they are, or were good.  Went there today and they are permanently closed.  Just a sign on the door.  I had a free sandwich to redeem.  I'll have to call corporate.  Too bad since we really liked their food.  Have to see about other locations.  They won't be close though.  Shame."}
{"text":"If you want to grab a quick bite at a place that is somewhat healthy, this might be a good option.  There is usually a wait because the place is packed - at least whenever I go there (Lunch during the work week).  Still, for me it is worth the wait.  There are a lot of Pitas to choose from and you have the ability to customize everything to your own taste.  Aside from the waiting, and a slightly high price for what you get, I do like this place.  A word to the wise: you may want to get your food to go since there is not much in the way of seating."}
{"text":"healthy perhaps, flavor less ... for sure. lower the dance music so we can hear each other when placing an order. I ordered a gyro which was just Damn disgusting. This is the subway of pita joints. As a matter of fact subway is better. I'll consider eating elsewhere. sorry pita pit, but ya suck!"}
{"text":"This place has not changed one bit. Currently sitting here enjoying a pita and it's incredible! Amazing customer service, fresh toppings, and the best value for your buck. There's no other food place in stockyards that will beat pita pit. Hands down the best."}
{"text":"Rien de mieux qu'un bon sandwich santé pour casser la croûte de temps à autre. Mon pita préféré est celui au poulet grillé. Le choix de garniture est vaste, il y a même des épinards. C'est ce que je préfère avec tomates, concombres, piments forts et une des nombreuses sauces offertes (chipotle est ma favorite). On peut ajouter une des trois ou quatre sortes de fromages disponibles. La totale! Un peu cher (presque 9$ pour un sandwich) mais les portions sont généreuses et l'aire de préparation est propre."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try out Pita Pit for a long period of time and chose today to be the lucky day. I've got to say, I'm quite surprised...at the lack of common sense the Kennedy & Progress in Toronto location lacks... majorly.  I decided to try a classic; Chicken CAESAR pita.  Once I was asked what toppings I would prefer, I asked \"What does a Chicken CAESAR usually come with?\". \"Oh you know, lettuce, bacon, chicken, parmesan cheese, and caesar dressing.\" After much deliberation, the choice was made and I opted for what it usually included. Or so I thought.  When I walked back to the office anticipating my Chicken CAESAR pita, I noticed within the first two bites that CAESAR dressing was nowhere to be tasted... After finishing half of the pita, still no sign of CAESAR dressing in my Chicken CAESAR pita. Unsatisfied, I threw out what was left.  I sit here in regret, with my tummy still rumbling and $9 poorer."}
{"text":"Wow..great place! Fresh tasting food, friendly and knowledgeable? staff! Awesome tasting chicken! Grade A"}
{"text":"Went here unexpectedly while getting gift card for nearby Zen Massage. We went in the back entrance, but since the back entrance is where the parking lot is located, it's really the front entrance. This is a negative because you walk right by the bathrooms prior to dining (not appetizing). A reversed layout might have made sense (if it was possible).   The guy taking our order was friendly and a conversationalist, which was cool. For some reason, I ordered a Turkey Pita at Pita Pit, but it was good. The only problem was that all the lettuce was to the left and all the turkey/cucumbers/tomatoes were to the right. So, I didn't get that mixed taste. However, the hot turkey was pretty darn good. As were the Otis Spunkmeyer chocolate chip cookies (not hot though).   I don't remember the other items ordered, so I can't comment on them at this time. I will get the Chicken Souvlaki next time for a more Mediterranean experience and update the review."}
{"text":"Review is not so much about the food, which is typically fresh and flavourful.  The service is great here with the manager and some of the staff having worked this location for more than 12 years. They remember you, they're personable, they make you feel important, it's like the Cheers of the pita world.    Oh and line ups never last here - they are fast with service."}
{"text":"Pita Pit is my favorite \"fast\" food!!! The workers load your pita with all the good stuff and there is no extra charge unless you get extras like baba ghanoush. I usually order the chicken souvlaki on whole wheat pita with alfalfa sprouts, baba, and other vegetables. It is so good!!! The workers are always friendly and willing to make your pita everything you want! Pay parking is available on the streets, although you could park on a residential street and walk if you didn't want to pay to park. I ate in a couple times but usually order out. The restaurant is spacious and almost never busy, which is nice if you don't like crowds or loud noises while you eat. I love this place and give it 5 stars! The price is right, the food is awesome and the service is great!"}
{"text":"I loved Pita Pit's sandwiches in my former college town, but was shocked when I ordered from the Strongsville location yesterday and found out that a thin pita filled with about a 1/4 cup of hummus, some spinach, tomatoes, and cucumbers costs $8. The clerk boasted that all pitas are $8 which makes it easy to ring up. Although it is an 8\" pita, when rolled up it is about the size of a 6\" Subway sub, which runs about $4. I don't recall the cost being so high at the Pita Pit in my previous town. I won't be stopping in here again, sorry but that is a rip-off for such a small sandwich."}
{"text":"Pita pit is boooooring!  That sums it up. It has the same concept of Subway where you can build your own sandwich but it's a pita.  I opted for the chicken cesar pita, they do grill strips of chicken in front of you instead of reheating it in an oven and then they take a flat pita, open the inside pocket and stuff it with whatever toppings you'd like. Lettuce, tomato, cheese..  There's not much to it, it was good,but wasn't anything great and I probably wouldn't ever go back. Du Parc area, I find so depressing, Pita Pit looks dim and dull. Just a bunch of poor students eating there wishing they could cook up a meal of their own..."}
{"text":"Great Pitas. Toppings are fresh. Love going here for lunch. Very filling. The Chicken Souvlaki is my favorite, add the res pepper hummus and hot sauce. Perfect."}
{"text":"Pita Pit is so amazing. I love the spicy black bean wrap. Unfortunately I cannot give a perfect five stars because of quality of customer service. It seems to depend on which employee is on shift of the quality of pita I receive. But nevertheless Pita Pit is a clean place with quality food :)"}
{"text":"These people have always been terribly rude, the service is terrible and the food has always been mediocre.   The nail in the coffin came when I saw an employee drop a pita on the floor, pick it up(I kid you not), and make a pita out of it.   I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"The Pita Pit is a great place to go if you have to run out of pick up something fast and healthy.  There menu is vast and I am working my way down it as I go. I have been there a couple times when I needed to stay on a project I was working on but I really needed to get something good to eat.  Thankfully these guys are close by.   As most places in Uptown(downtown) the lunch time line will be long but they keep it moving.  I haven't found a bad pita I didn't like. So I will give 4 stars for good food, fast service, and great people behind the counter.  You will want to go there during a non-rush hour time to look through the menu since the move people through quickly."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty food for a pretty decent price.  3 1/3 stars is more deserved but they get the benefit of the doubt on this one.   The environment can get pretty shady in here after dark so I would recommend going during the day.  In fact the good food and the price point is the only thing that carries this place past 1 star so don't be shocked if you don't consider it better than a 2 star joint."}
{"text":"Ate here awhile ago and was kinda grossed out.  Got a gyro pita.  The highschool girl who made it opened the meat cooler drawer under the grill with her plastic food service gloves on, grabbed the meat for the grill, closed the fridge with her gloved hands, then proceeded to make my sandwich with the same pair of gloves.  Nasty.  The idea of gloves is not just to protect your hands from getting food on them as much as its to protect my food from getting contaminated with all the nastiness you touch in between making the food.  Gloves need to be changed between each customer, especially due to food allergies someone may have to something you just touched on that last customer's sandwich.  Management needs to get a handle on these things, you're lucky I don't work for the Health Department.    The food was underwhelming, the pita meat was gross pre-formed strips in the shape of turkey bacon, barely tasted like what I know pita meat to taste like (I'm not Greek so Showmars is my benchmark here).  The pita bread was not soft enough and wasn't heated adequately.  If you have the word \"Pita\" in the name of the business at least get some good product to use in the gyro....that's the sandwich people think of when they see the word \"pita\".    I've had Pita Pit at the location downtown Charlotte with better luck.  I hope this location gets things turned around because it's a nice concept and good alternative too all the greasy fast food chains on Independence Blvd.  The staff was friendly at least, so....1 star for that."}
{"text":"Im so glad this opened!   Pita Pit is a great place for a quick bite to eat. I recommend the gyro or caesar wrap.  This location just opened & the staff here are super friendly. I was greeted right away when I walked in & the girl at the register told me about all the specials (on wednesdays its double meat for .99). Its a Chipotle esque enviornment where you pick your pita, then pick all the ingredients that go inside.  I love that they also have the soda fountain where you can make pretty much any flavor.  Will definitely be back because I already like the food & the service was great."}
{"text":"I think I'm going to start coming to the Pita Pit more often for lunch as I was in and out very quickly. The only thing is that for some reason (to which I can't put my finger on), the menu feels very limited. They told the man in line before me that his next pita was free, not sure if there is a rewards program, but if so I was not offered to join.   This visit I ordered the chicken crave with extra cheese with a white pita. I opted for an assortment of veggies, pepper jack cheese and the jalapeño ranch. I was very pleased with my combination.   What I like so much about Pita Pit is that it still has that same sort of Subway taste but the ingredients and the quality tastes so much better.   4 stars."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. They have a great selection of pitas and items to put on your pita. The taste was delicious and the small was enough for 2 people."}
{"text":"Just ate at Pita Pit on Mill Ave for the first time the other night & loved it. They do it Subway style where you pick all of your toppings from a large assortment of veggies & dressings.  The Pita bread is soft & chewy, the veggies were fresh, the hummus was delicious. And the cherry on top was the super friendly service. There were 2 girls working & they couldn't have been nicer.  I see a lot of Falafels in my future."}
{"text":"Really love this place!!!! Workers are all smiles and friendly. Food is delicious. I wish they still offered alfalfa sprouts but it is what it is."}
{"text":"I stopped by Pita Pit for the first time and it was awesome! The guys working were super cool, the food was fresh, the place so clean...it was so fresh and so clean. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"In my order I got a falafel pita and the Chicago gyro pita. The falafel was actually pretty good, but let me tell you, I've gotten gyro in Chicago before and it had at least 8x more meat. This pita is woefully empty."}
{"text":"This is an updated review on Pita Pit. I'm writing this review as a warning. As a lover of Pita Pit, I chose them for delivery through Postmates a couple days ago without hesitation. I got the gyro (a Pita I get frequently) and my mother in law got the chicken. My Pita was fantastic as always. My husband didn't order anything because he was somewhat sick and didn't feel up to eating a whole pita, but he did have the last couple bites of mine. This is where everything went wrong. A few hours later I am having intense stomach cramps, chills/sweats, and problems with my bowels. I toss and turn all night with stomach pain. The next day there is BLOOD in my stool. I research all my symptoms and it's all matching up with E. Coli. My mother in law didn't feel sick at all, but me and my husband are both feeling crummy, and I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth (and gurgling in my stomach) from one of my favorite places. What a shame :(  PLEASE PITA PIT - wash your hands, cook all meat thoroughly, and make sure your veggies are still edible."}
{"text":"I ate here 2-3 times a week for almost a year and couldn't take it anymore. There are a couple workers that are ok, but there are a few that are absolutely horrible. 4 times in a row I was in, once they kicked me out because they were to busy with a catering order, and the other 3 times they messed up every single persons order in the restaurant, on top of making people wait 20+ minutes for a pita. I'm not sure how they are still in business with some of the employees they hire. I was dedicated, but I won't go back. Save your time and money. These multiple bad visits happened from beginning to mid November."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Wife ordered BLT...  Got home and all it had was the L and T!?!?  How hard is it to make a B L T?!?   My gyro was way below expectations.  Reminded me of a Subway with pita pockets.  Joke of an establishment."}
{"text":"Just Eat Delivery Service: Worst Ever. Never on time and the order is wrong 50% of the time.  Waited 2 HOURS tonight for delivery. Arrived cold. Arrived wrong.  COME ON GUYS."}
{"text":"Forgot my prepped meals and was in a bind. Pita pit came thru for me in just the right time. I don't think you can really do any wrong in what they do....Love how they post the calories beside everything for the calorie minded eaters! As well as provide a nutritional breakdown pamphlet."}
{"text":"For what it is - healthy food on the move, this place succeeds. My young son and I jumped in before a class of his in the area. The staff, while college students, were super attentive and great with him. The food was really good, fast, and with drink and cookies and walked out for about $15. They had lots of veggies options and they are diced up so that you aren't trying to pull giant pieces of cucumber out of your wrap. The bathrooom was clean - as was the rest of the place. We were both big fans and will be back."}
{"text":"I've ate here a few times recently. Food was good and fresh and a different spine to a subway type of restaurant.    They had a good amount of choices for different Pitas and the portion of pita sandwich you get is a good value for the price.   The staff were very polite and attended to my needs with a smile. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fresh Food, Good Taste, but it's just OK. The elements of the food are good, I like the subway style add your toppings to your pita part, and if you feel like spending $8-9 dollars on a pita then.... this is the place. Staff has been a mixed bag over the last two years. Some ok, some great."}
{"text":"I came here after a long walk around Tempe Town Lakes, and a good workout at the gym also.  Starving, I wanted something fast and healthy.  I was not disappointed!  This reminds me of a cross between Chipotle and Subway, but healthier and tastier than both.  I enjoyed a chicken pita, with hummus and avocado spread. I also got the double protein to refuel after the long workout.  There was a wide selection of veggies, and I was afraid I was going to have a too stuffed pita!  Fear not, the employee made it fit and folded up neatly like a burrito.  I bit into it with gusto, loved the first taste to the last.  This is a great healthy place to get nutritious food, that is tasty and not salty to boot.  Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Ordered from them off seamless and they will be my go-to when I need to order in while I have late work to finish up. I tried their Philly Steak pita. Delicious! I also had it with Pita and Dip (their special sauce). Real good. Definitely worth a try. Also really affordable. Have never tried it at their location, so I can't really speak about the establishment, but the food was great."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Went to lunch Tuesday at 1230, no one there and no customers during the entire 40 minutes. The Pita was ok, meat was rangy somewhat small and not fresh. Nice servers. $10 later still hungry."}
{"text":"I had a good experience here.  All I wanted was pita and hummus.  They made it up pretty quickly, and I was happy with the customer service.  The hummus was good, and I like how they grilled the pita.  It made it crispy like pita chips."}
{"text":"**3.5 stars**  Pita Pit was a great find as I was in search of a healthy bite to eat.    We were greeted by a very friendly gentleman at the counter.  He took our order and began making a couple of people's order.  When he got to ours, he calls you over and asked you specifically what you want on your pita, love that customization!  My veggie pita was good and all ingredients were fresh, at least on my pita.  My husband had the gyro which the meat is frozen and is then cooked on the grill to order.     Prices are reasonable, parking was easy, service was friendly, food was good!"}
{"text":"Sometime in the past couple months since my last review, a guy started working during the lunch our that I pressume to be the owner.  Service was big complaint in my last review, and that has completely changed - it's vastly improved.   Food is still tastey - one of the best places in the area for a quick, reasonably healthy lunch."}
{"text":"I was initially reluctant to give this place a try but my wife convinced me and I was tired of eating at the fast food spots in the area. Inside I was worried because it looks like a subway clone and I'm just not a big fan of subway. The menu had a lot more options than I thought it would and they have a grill! So when you order the steak of Philly cheese streak (my current fav) they actually cook it on the grill, they don't just throw it in a microwave for 30 secs. On Wednesday you can get double meat for like a buck extra which is s pretty good deal. Once you've chosen the type of pits your going to get and they grill it up for you then very much like subway, you get to pick and choose your toppings/fillings. The staff there have all been very friendly and nice, more than they need to be and they actually seem to care about putting together your pita. They aren't trying to throw everything together as quick as they can. I've been impressed with the past two visits and I'm hoping to cut out the fast food places and replace it with this spot more and more. The only downside is the construction going on with the street, it makes getting in and out annoying, but for me it's has been worth it. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended Pita Pit to me since I live close. The store opened just a few weeks ago and he had already visited there 5 times. With a review like that, I had to go!  I stopped in on a weekday afternoon and was instantly greeted by the pleasant staff. I told them it was my first time there and the young lady was happy to have me visit and told me a bit about the menu. When I selected my pita, she confirmed it was a great choice.  The next girl who made my sandwich was the same kind of friendly- very customer service oriented and appreciative of their customers. She suggested perfect toppings for my chicken souvlaki. It was delicious- lots of flavor, well constructed and a pretty good price.  The dining room was clean, with a few tables and booths for seating. Menu board was easy to read and everything seemed very organized.  I wish they had Pepsi products, that would really be the only thing to improve the dining experience. I will be back for certain!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical to try this place at first. I've never had the urge to try pita anything but this establishment was a pleasant surprise.   This restaurant is set up kind of like a sub shop with the exception of a flat top grill where they cook the meat in front of you and add it in hot with your wrap or salad. The meat appeared to already be pre-cooked before going on the grill but having a nice, hot and savory scoop of chicken and bacon added to the wrap made it taste a bit more fresh.   Let's get to the good stuff...the food! I got what was called \"the local\". I believe it had a mix of onion, cilantro, tomatoes, chicken, bacon, and house made Italian dressing as the grill base. I loaded my wrap up with roasted red bell peppers, cucumber, green bell peppers, banana peppers, cheese, guacamole, and honey mustard. They had an assortment of goodies to add to your wrap or salad to customize your food to however you like it. The employee could barely wrap the pita with everything inside!!   The only thing I have had closest to this would be a salad wrap and \"the local\" far surpassed what my taste buds were expecting. The wrap was phenomenal, fresh and full of flavor!   The only downside to my experience was the employees were not in any hurry to complete the order. They all took their time and there was no teamwork, instead of standing around they could of helped out. It took about 15-20 minutes to make 4 sandwiches... They were however very pleasant and helpful. You gained a customer."}
{"text":"I miss this place! I use to eat here on a weekly basis when I worked in the downtown area. My favourite go to place for lunch whenever I'm in the Adelaide Street West area. Don't let the small space put you off. You will not be disappointed, friendly staff and a quick healthy lunch. What more can you ask for. This place is a gem and the healthy yet tasty menu keeps me coming back for more. You've got try this place."}
{"text":"Was nice and clean. I got the chicken breast pita. I like that's it's healthy. I just feel like it's a different version of subway. Same toppings nothing really Mediterranean, which I thought it would have a little more of ethnic feel to it since they are pittas. They grill the chicken cut it up, put it in a white or wheat pita then ask you what toppings you want . Pretty simple. It was average to me but would go again. Seen nothing wrong with it but just felt it was average. Nothing wrong but nothing special."}
{"text":"Vegan review: If you live or go to school in Tempe, or are visiting, you may find yourself in the late night partying and/or hustle bustle of Mill Ave. Luckily, Pita Pit is one of only a couple of places in the area where you can get vegan-friendly eats past midnight (Fridays and Saturdays they're open until 3am; they're open until midnight M-Th).  I ordered the spicy black bean burger (it's cut in pieces for the pita), on whole wheat pita with red pepper hummus spread and avocado spread, then topped it with various veggies and their secret sauce (which is a vegan spicy vinaigrette). At my request, they cleaned the grill and used clean utensils when cooking my black bean burger. It was a little over $7 and it was decent but not amazing. Neither the spicy black bean burger nor the secret sauce were spicy.   They have a list of the available sauces and it shows which ones are vegan."}
{"text":"One word... Gyro! Many ways of pronouncing it, but who cares... The Pita Pit won't charge you for the wrong pronunciation. (Says it on the tip jar..) Anywho, the Gyro is very tasty. Didn't feel like eating anything heavy for dinner so I opted for the gyro. Fresh ingredients, with a choice of white or wheat pita. Great service and great location...Can't go wrong with the Pita Pit... A much more healthier option."}
{"text":"A very nice surprise awaits at the Pita Pit, my expectations were exceeded as I was pleasantly served by a very polite and helpful young lady who explained menu items cheerfully and prepared my order carefully.  My selection was a combination Gyro, Chicken and Falafel pita which I found delicious with my choice of accompaniments from their vast array of vegetables, sauces, spreads and seasonings.  This tasty treat was washed down by a FREE refreshing serving of sweet tea (special of the day, thank you!).  This place is a winner and I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I cant believe I never visited this place before. As a vegetarian (although this is place has many non-vegetarian options) and a middle-east native this is pure joy.  The concept of a burrito like pita bread filled with fresh vegetables is one of my favorites. Yes I miss the fresh falafel and maybe a different variety of things to put inside (as compered to back home) but this place is still wonderful I only wish it was closer to my work place."}
{"text":"The Pita Pit is now open on Mill. I had the chicken caesar pita wrap. It was very tasty. Decent sized portions of chicken and bacon. Bacon was a nice touch! Although, I was a little surprised that Parmesan cheese wasn't an option...even though that was listed on the menu. Next time I will probably ask for a little more dressing.   Positive notes -good serving sizes -you can customize your pita however you want -they have some breakfast pitas that are available all day that sound interesting"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh food with a great selection of toppings and sauces. I love the chicken Caesar pita because it has bacon. Employees are friendly."}
{"text":"Good. Came very fast even for a bike delivery. We used grub hub to order the food and when they didnt have soup they got my number from the site and called to ask what we wanted instead. Delivery girl was sweet and adorable! Made sure the order was correct!"}
{"text":"I love the food at Pita Pit, but this location is seriously lacking.  It's really dirty.  Used the bathroom and, well I won't go into it... it it wasn't pleasant.   The woman who made my pita also took my order.  She was already wearing her disposable plastic gloves, which were dirty from making food.  She used the gloves to punch in my order on the register and then took my credit card...gave it back to me and the card now had food on it.  She said \"whoops\", but never threw them out!!  Just went back to making food with the same gloves on!!  As if they were there to protect her hands from getting dirty, not me from eating all those germs!!  Best part, she started scratching her nose and still never changed gloves.    I got my pita, walked to the door, threw it out it and walked down to the burrito place.  Nasty."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to check out Pita Pit and decided to head over today around noon, and there was a line out the door. Not knowing how things works, the individual who took my order explained he only needed my meat selection and I would choose everything else down the line.  As I waited I observed the organization the staff has and the line moves pretty quickly. Everything is prepared fresh, heated in front of you, and you can choose any toppings, and there are a lot, before finalizing your pita. They tighly wrap the pita so nothing falls out and was warm when I got back to my desk. The only thing I will say is the pita got a little soft so it did turn out a little messy as I enjoyed it...no worries though, it was worth it.  I will definitely keep this place in mind when I am looking for something a little different than a plain old bread."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite pita pit thanks to Richard. My boyfriend and I pretty much follow him to every pita pit he works at.  This location is the closest to our house and now has the best service and as always great food. Clear communication, great suggestions, pretty quick staff and always working to progress from what I can see!"}
{"text":"Terrific food! Clean restaurant! No wait on a Sunday afternoon! My favorite is the philly steak wrap! The veggie is also awesome! Hummus makes any wrap better! Thank you for an excellent experience!"}
{"text":"Not a bad lunch place. Pita was filling and the soda machine has tons of options. I would go again."}
{"text":"I guess I should have looked at the other reviews before coming here...  I stopped in to grab 2 pitas on a weekday afternoon and was heckled by the staff for using a Bucky Book coupon. It was for a BOGO pita and a drink, but they were very troubled about which drinks counted for the coupon. For the record, the coupon said \"free pita and beverage with any pita and beverage purchase.\" Seems to me like it could be any of the drinks...  Anyway, I got 1 hummus pita and 1 falafel. They were very close in price, so I was confused when the guy making me pita asked if I wanted hummus in the second pita. All pitas come with hummus, so it's not worthwhile to just get a \"hummus pita,\" FYI. Both pitas were ok, not terrible.  While stopping in with a friend a week later on a Sunday afternoon (I abstained from getting a pita that time because of previous heckling), they informed her they were out of chicken, turkey, bacon, and various other meats. All they had left were steak and veggie options. I found it funny but also a bit troubling that they had run out of so many things. Are they aware there is a grocery store mere blocks away?  It doesn't seem like this location is managed very well..."}
{"text":"After living through a year of University Pita Pit, I have grown to really appreciate Pita Pit Richmond Hill. I used to go here so often, that the employees to this day still remember my name :')  The workers are always very enthusiastic when serving their customers. A lot of pita place employees usually don't treat me with as much as care as the Pita Pit Richmond Hill staff.  The ingredients are also very fresh. I've never seen any browning on any of the vegetables that they serve. They consistently stock the toppings to maintain freshness throughout the day.  The best part is that this Pita Pit has access to a pita steamer AND toaster, so you can have your pita both warm and crispy :) Hurray for no stale pita pockets!  My favourite pitas are: - Spicy Black Bean (vegan food is actually very tasty) - Turkey - Buffalo Chicken - Plain veggie with babaganous/avocado/hummus - PITA CHIPS!!!!!!!!!! with chipotle sauce / sweet chili thai sauce / teriyaki sauce  I do find the grilled chicken pita to be a bit too salty, and the avocado is understandably watery (since it's free) If you really like the taste of avocado, do not hesitate to ask for extra.  Love you pita pit!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good variety and fair prices. The only thing I don't like is that sometimes the greens could be fresher, and (not their fault) customers need to stop leaning over the sneeze guard to point - especially the guys obviously fighting off colds)."}
{"text":"We enjoyed great service from the college women working on a Saturday.  They explained the options and made some great suggestions.  Enjoyed watching the Badgers demolish Indiana on the big flat screen TV."}
{"text":"Just had a last minute catering request and the staff was awesome enough to accommodate me !!  Thank you for your help and the great service."}
{"text":"The Pita Pit chain is the most expensive university food. I'd eaten at the chain when I went to Oklahoma State and I'd say it's for sure the most overpriced sandwich shop near UNLV. It's a good $9-$12 for a meal. Granted, if you actually put vegetables on your sandwich (I put literally everything they offer on mine) you won't need to eat for the rest of the day, but I still. Not cheap for students.   I've had the gyro (good) and the Dagwood (meh.) I'd stick with the gyro meat. I love that they have a bevy of spreads and sauces, but again, they definitely charge you for it.   The place is clean, but I've also noticed how employees switch between jobs without changing gloves - which defeats the purpose of the gloves.  Although the food is good, it's too expensive as a student for me to make this a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"The Pita Pit commercializes a reinvention of the sandwich. Their routine is basically the same you would hear at any other sandwich place, whether you want white or wheat, what toppings, etc, but they have a few refreshing differences.  I ordered a gyro pita pocket.  There are a lot more choices of spreads, including tsiziki, which is what I picked. To be honest, their tsiziki wasn't anything very special, to me, but it's nice that they offered it.   There are also a lot of stuffings, too. Some that I found appealing: feta cheese, alfalfa sprouts, and artichoke hearts! Yum!   After building your pita pocket, they wrap it up in sub paper for you. Personally, I would have appreciated to eat mine in a bowl with a fork and knife because my pita pocket was pretty stuffed, but I managed well enough.  The Pita Pit is the place to stop by if you are craving a fun, healthy meal. Mine definitely filled me up."}
{"text":"I was excited to have a pita shop so close to home, however watching the cook heat up pre-cooked meat was not what I expected.   Watched the cook open the drawer under the cook top to retrieve the pre-cooked meat and then slam the drawer with his foot numerous times.  The chicken pita that I received tasted like pre-cooked boiled chicken.  For the price, I expected way more.  Wont be returning."}
{"text":"This was my second time ordering a pita from here. Today, the chicken in my grilled chicken pita was gray. Not gray-tinged white or just gray on the outside (possibly due to a marinade), but gray through and through. It was really unappetizing. And being pregnant, I didn't feel it was safe to eat. So unfortunately, it got tossed in the trash. I will think twice before grabbing a quick lunch here in the future."}
{"text":"Yummmm! The dude working was so helpful and walked us through the whole process, even made some awesome suggestions! I don't remember his name, but he is vegan if that helps? He's the best!  I built an insane black bean burger wrap that had an embarrassing amount of veggies, Hubbs had the buffalo chicken. Will return for a fast, fresh, quick dinner soon!"}
{"text":"Located just down the street from where I study/work,  I've had many lunch and late night dinners at the Pita Pit.   The concept is much like Subway's where you order your type of sub and add w.e. you see fit.  The selection of 'toppings', here, is more extensive, including hummus, baba ganoush, romaine lettuce, pineapple (you read that right), pickled jalapenos (thank god), and more.  For meat, I almost always get the 'buffalo chicken' (which I believe is NOT made out of chicken carcass), reheated live on a hot metal plate.  In terms of price, it's about the same as Subway (a bit more expensive), but it tastes one notch above. I'm also under the impression that it's healthier, mainly because I get a lot more vegetables than I would at subway.   One sketchy thing, though, is that service is variable, some workers really seem like they don't wanna be there xD."}
{"text":"I let the young lady behind the counter lead me through choosing a pita and stuffing it. I got something with chicken and then it had various vegetables and a sauce and some feta cheese. Delicious and filling. And yes, I had lots of spinach still stuck in my teeth. lol  Don't worry if there's a queue. Just after I dug into my pita, a dozen construction workers in fluorescent vests poured in followed by an ambulance crew. The two ladies behind the counter had them eating within five minutes.  Hint for folks who work such places... when someone asks, \"What's good?\" your answer shouldn't be \"Everything.\" Try \"I really like the such-and-such.\" I'm sure *everything* is good but I need a bit of a hint when the menu board offers this many choices.  Note: Despite the address, Pita Pit is actually on College."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far, and each time my pita has been amazingly delicious.  I got the Dagwood the first time, and the Chicken Souvlaki the second.  The great thing about this place is that you choose what type of pita bread you want, and then what you want in your pita (Subway-style)... from a variety of veggies to sauces.  The avocado does not cost extra like at other restaurants, which is nice.  The meat is cooked fresh in front of you and placed inside the pita.  With a convenient location right across UNLV, I'll be coming back here more often!"}
{"text":"I had gone to the Pita Pit once before in the South Side and was totally underwhelmed.  Obviously it took me a while to go back.  Since a friend wanted to meet there I obliged, thinking maybe it would be better.  I'm happy to report it definitely was.  The downtown store is a well oiled machine, cranking them out fast for lunch rush hour.  I ordered a turkey pita with my personal favorite toppings: pickles, banana pepper, olives, lettuce, tomato and onions.  I also chose the horseradish dressing.  Good choice... I could almost pat myself on the back for that!  It made the pita!    I didn't realize they heat up the turkey, but it actually made it taste better.  My only complaint was that the paper they wrapped it in stuck to the pita, so half the time I had to peel it off the pita.  Some parts it wouldn't come off so I probably ate some less than appetizing paper.  Oh well, I'm still alive!    If you're looking for a quick meal around this area of downtown it's a decent choice!"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is but there is something about this place that truly gives me happy face. I always get the dagwood. Mmmmmmm. Great prices, big a** pita's, and they are super tasty. I LOVE this place. Good middle of the night muchie joint too."}
{"text":"Looking for something on the go? Pita pit is fast and better then other fast food joints. Pick your toppings. I like their chicken Slouvaki :) If you're in the area. Stop in.  I'm a huge fan of pita wraps! Parking lot. Casual. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Good service, clean environment, and our pitas turned out amazing. Vegetables were very fresh."}
{"text":"Imagine Subway, but with Pitas instead of bread...that basically sums up the Pita Pit. I may have gone in with my expectations too high, or maybe I went at a bad time of day, but I just didn't like this place as much as I'd hoped I would.   On my way home on a Thursday evening, I stopped at Pita Pit for dinner. I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki on a wheat pita. I was good, but it wasn't great. The place was pretty dead with only one guy working and the toppings for the Pitas (hummus, lettuce, mushrooms, etc) looked like they'd been sitting out for quite some time. This was a disappointment because I'd kept hearing about how \"fresh\" the ingredients at this place are. The server, however was both friendly and helpful in taking my order. And the Pita was decent. I will definitely try it again because it IS a nice alternative to subway and I really want to like this place, but this time I will order the falafel.  And update will be posted at that time. Until then, all I can say is...\"It was ok.\""}
{"text":"Pita Pit is LIFE! Very clean, food is fresh and fast. Staff is very helpful. Great job"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. I'd never been here before and they help you out when you order so you know what you are doing.  Healthy options.  There were several options listed on a board when you just walk in highlighting their healthy options.  I ordered the falafel and was very tasty.  Overall this was just what I was looking for and had a good experience.  Good food, service."}
{"text":"Love pita pit!! Only reason I didn't give it 5, was because they were under staffed. The guy behind the counter kicked some but though, he had 10 people come in all at once and handled it without any help. Get some more employees and quit over working your staff."}
{"text":"We received a catered lunch from a sales rep today. The large tray of pita sandwiches and hummus were very fresh. I tried a prime rib and Dagwood style Pita,they were delicious! Our staff cleared out the hummus dip quickly. Highly recommend the Pita Pit!!"}
{"text":"the food is fresh. they cook it right in front of you. plenty of choices. spicy chicken with chipotle sauce and teriyaki sauce is delicious!"}
{"text":"I usually dont give 5 stars.  I have been to Pita Pit on Maryland pkwy numerous times in the last 2 weeks.  The staff is always extremely nice, friendly and they go out of their way to make sure you have a good experience.  The place is also spotless not a spec anywhere.  Now on to the food.  You order what Pita you want and then you choose either white or wheat pita.  After that you can watch them cook your meat on the flat top .  Next you pick what you want to add and the list is endless.  I have to say i am partial to the Dagwood.  Awesome pita.  Also they are open to midnight on the weekends. Keep it up guys lovin your food."}
{"text":"I've been to lots of Pita Pit restaurants, but the customer service at this location was amazing and the staff were so friendly. The food was great too. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"This brought me immediately back to my university days. I ordered a chicken caesar pita and this tasted just like the ones in Waterloo!!!   For a quick grab and go lunch you can't really go wrong."}
{"text":"Subway style creation of pita sandwiches (select your toppings as they make your sandwich in front of you, through a glass window with latex gloves, of course).  Customization is better than I thought.  I've forgotten how many times I have to amend a falafel pita sandwich when I order it elsewhere.  Yes there are vegetarian options, but only if you don't mind the falafel or other veg ingredients on the same skillet right after they prepare someone else's beef."}
{"text":"Been here twice for lunch and its pretty decent. The first time I was expecting just another fast food joint and while it does have that type of vibe/service I was surprise by how good the food was. Yes, you build you meal like a subway, in which you choose what you want in your pita-sub and you can add chips and a drink. But the combinations are pretty good. Plus the have sauces and other ingredients that or places might not have; like Hummus and tsakiti sauce. So if you want something \"Healthy\"(depends on what you order) and quick, this is a great choice."}
{"text":"I met a group of fellow Yelper's for my first time visit to the Pita Pit.  Pita Pit offers healthier choices for a faster food option.  You select your protein and then build a custom made sandwich or salad from there. Choices range from chicken, beef, tuna, ham, turkey and breakfast or vegetarian options.  I had the chicken Souvlaki pita.  While the chicken was freshly grilled, the real star is the topping and sauce selection.  There are 18 toppings, 5 cheeses, and 18 sauces to customize your creation.  They do not skimp either.  My sandwich was stuffed with fresh vegetables and wrapped in a soft and warm, whole wheat pita.  Side dishes offered are bagged chips, pita & dip, or Otis Spunkmeyer cookies.  While I liked my chicken, I like the Falafel even better that another Yelper let me sample.  Another Yelper had a breakfast pita, but that did not appeal to me.  It looked like the egg used was a pre-cooked egg product instead of a fresh egg.  I understand that this is fast food so they need to use pre-cooked eggs, bacon, etc., but not my cup of tea. Bottom line, this is a great and tasty sandwich option for fast food.  You can fill up on fresh veggies and protein which is so much better for you.   This location just opened last month and there are plans to expand to several other locations in NEO.  Manager, Brian, plans to open a Strongsville location this spring."}
{"text":"Love the pitas! Spicy black bean pita is great! The ingredients being used are always fresh and taste great. Staff always greets you with a smile. I definitely recommend them and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken gyro pita & it was very tasty! Perfect size... The two guys that worked there were pretty nice. We're new to the area & they were pretty welcoming.   My wife had the chicken Caesar pita- she liked that as well.   I recommend this place for a quick sandwich!"}
{"text":"It's like a Subway, but just with cooked meats and Mediterranean flavors.  I tried their gyro meat, which is 3 evenly cut strips of of gyro meat on the grill.  The fun part is when I get to add a variety of ingredients in my wrap.  There's hummus spread, garlic spread, olives, different types of lettuce, artichoke hearts and the usual cucumber and tomato, some peppers and a few more options.    The pita is stuffed with all the goodies, then they roll it all up for a easy to eat wrap.  If you come on Wednesday, it appears they have double meat for only $.99 versus the norm $2.  This is the time to come and get the deal, or else the meal is not worth it.  I've only been here a couple of times and I would say, they're so so on flavor.  I may have to give them another try."}
{"text":"The manager Josh was extremely helpful with fixing my last experience. Prompt with response and gave me a coupon so I could give pita pit another try. Last night I went in to Pita Pit and it was great. Everyone was friendly and my pita was great. Thanks Josh and the employees at Pita Pit. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't receive much foot traffic, probably because they are located in the well hidden district that is known as, Acorn Alley. I've only been here twice and so far, so good.   Decent food, nice employees, nothing super special about the place though. I suppose my only complaints are that they don't serve soup at this location (even though its on the menu), and their jalapeños are pickled, not freshly cut. Also, most of the pitas are priced in the six dollar range, which seems a little high for what you're getting.   On the plus side, they have a rather large menu that displays how many calories are in each item. And they serve breakfast all day... which is awesome in my book!  If you're in a rush and looking for a quick bite, or if you're just tired of going to Subway, stop over in Kent and give them a try."}
{"text":"Good food. Great prices.  Awesome customer service!  The establishment is super clean and the employees were helpful and on top of everything.  They have a large variety of foods and toppings.  I had fun trying all the different flavors of their soda machine.    Definitely a good place to grab a quick bite to eat without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"This is a great, affordable spot to grab a quick bite to eat at any time of day. Although I haven't been for breakfast, steak and eggs is next on my list to try. We like to stop by after using the UNLV gym, as the location is very close to campus, easily within walking distance from any of the residence halls. There are pre-configured items on the menu, but the best part about this place is that everything is customizable! They have nearly two dozen sauces to adorn any type of pita you like. Certain pitas come with different meat choices or vegetarian options. Once you choose the base of your pita, you get to customize it with a wide selection of veggies, spreads, cheeses, and of course the sauces. You can be as healthy or as indulgent as you want to be, which is something I love in a restaurant! I would definitely recommend Pita Pit for eaters of any taste preference."}
{"text":"I thought it was okay. Staff was friendly and patient while we looked over the menu. I chose the chicken souvlaki pita. It was nice they offered avocado without an additional charge. The chicken was very bland however, even with avocado and tzaziki sauce.   The pita looks more like a burrito since they fold it over and roll it up. A pita to me is always served open at the top and more sturdy. With so many Mediterranean and sandwich places in town I wasn't too impressed."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave it a 3 and not a 4 is because I mean come on it's fast food.  I got the gyro combo and they actually heated the meat up on the griddle.  The food was really good and they even have feta as a cheese choice on the bar.  I was very impressed."}
{"text":"a great location with excellent standards. when i come here for lunch sometimes, im left with the problem of not knowing what to get due to the vast amount of options, and toppings are another trip down that same road. the staff are always happy and super efficient in taking your order and getting you out in a timely fashion. the restaurant is always spotless, and lots of parking"}
{"text":"Okay. I gave them one more shot and they definitely redeemed themselves.   Delicious food as always, and delivered ON TIME. Woohoo! That's all I am asking for, folks. And they got it right this time.   I will continue to order from them. As long as they keep up their end of the bargain, I am a happy customer once again."}
{"text":"Why go to a regular sub shop when you've got the Pita Pit? They grill the meat fresh for you, and you can pick out extra ingredients just like you can at most sub shops.  For some reason, I always like the bright green and orange colors when I come in here. The place feels so alive and bustling, I just can't help but leave happy."}
{"text":"The pita pit closest to our house has permanently closed down and we were craving a pita so we decided to see what else was in the area. We found this location and decided to give it a shot. We weren't disappointed.   The food was good and fresh, the atmosphere was clean and friendly, and we had a long good talk with the owner who is doing all the right things from a business standpoint. We found our new go to pita place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Very affordable price points, fresh ingredients and great staff. While the pitas are very filling and there are many choices, I usually just go here for lunch and the place draws a very good crowd from what I've seen. All of the added options are very fairly priced and you can have a great munch for under $10 here and feel like you received a great deal for your money. An alternative to people who are tired of subs and salads and would like some more interesting flavors. Top notch!"}
{"text":"Wow! After my first Pita Pit experience, I'm a fan!  Very tasty, fresh, and healthy! The interior is bright and inviting and the workers are quick and efficient, so the line moves at a good pace.  You tell the cashier what kind of pita you want: chicken souvlaki, gyro, prime rib, falafel, or a variety of breakfast pitas... I went with prime rib on a regular wheat pita loaded up with tasty, fresh toppings (fillings). They grill master cooks up the meat and brings it over to the assembly line to place it inside the the giant, fluffy pita.  You get your choice from a plethora of fresh veggies, cheeses, sauces, and other assorted condiments to fill your pita sammich.  It all gets rolled up tightly and you're ready to indulge!  I'm looking forward to seeing more Pita Pit locations open up in Cleveland! Very delicious!"}
{"text":"Super yummy pitas and smoothies!  Staff is friendly and down to earth."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great spot for lunch. Had the Artisan Chicken Pesto on a wheat pita today. Got it all grilled including the veggies. Perfect preparation and flavor. Friendly, thoughtful, and attentive staff that wants diners to have a great experience. We'll be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"So happy to finally have a Pita Pit in the area!! Friendly, quick service. Ingredients are always fresh and tasty. I always drive by and see hardly any cars, come on people you have to go to Pita Pit!! The falafel is my personal favorite, and who doesn't love the fun soda machine?"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on a recent trip to the area. We've both had Pita Pit before and were excited to eat there again.  Their website indicated they had a \"happy hour\" from 8pm to 11pm which included a chicken pita and a drink for $5 and if you checked in on Facebook, a free cookie.  When we arrived, we asked about the happy hour and the employee responded that they did not have happy hour. When I showed him the website that clearly indicated happy hour at that particular location, he shrugged it off and did not honor it.  We still ordered chicken pitas. Looking at their \"fresh\" veggies, there were clearly slimy chunks of lettuce in the romaine, which caused us to choose the shredded lettuce instead. Unfortunately, neither my friend or I enjoyed the pitas, they were dry and tasteless. Before we left, my friend asked if she could use the bathroom and the employee replied that another coworker had locked the key in their two days prior and nothing had been done about it. Yikes, talk about some management issues.  I would recommend Pita Pit management better educate their employees on specials and ensure their vegetables are fresh - patrons should not be seeing old vegetables on the line."}
{"text":"Always super friendly staff. I love that I can create my own pita. Healthier option that always fills me up and tastes great! Will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"First time visiting and I have to say I'm pretty pleased. Food was really good and really a great value - around $7.00 for a pita was that was stuffed rather full and a medium fountain drink. If I ever find myself in the area again and need a quick and filling lunch this will definitely be a top choice."}
{"text":"Very happy and pleased with the great service.  Have gone several times in the past 2 weeks and it's been consistent"}
