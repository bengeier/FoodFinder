{"text":"These guys are down the street from my work and sometimes they are late delivering. It's owned by Afghanis who cut back on everything thus the quality of food is poor. No joke they have the worst French fries you'll ever eat, actually order them and give them to a friend as a joke it's hilarious. The pizza is average at best and flatter than a pancake so go for it if your really desperate. Niko's is a much higher quality place that's in the same neighbourhood"}
{"text":"Good neighbourhood pizzeria for take out or delivery. Fast delivery & fair prices. I suggest Vegetarian Pizza... with an Extra of... Bacon! LOL"}
{"text":"Usually around 1:30am I'm hungry and no better way then to get a greasy pizza to satisfy that craving. Mario's is the place I call when I have the boys over and we are a couple beers deep. Ill say that the choice around that time are limited but still give us what we want. I recommend the \"Americana\" pizza for the meat lovers and the \"italian\" for the others. I love this pizza because it's not too saucy nor is it thick."}
{"text":"I used to work near by, choices were limited when you lived on a budget and wanted to order out for lunch, Mario's sometimes has its days served good food for an affordable price, but yes at the cost of quality, but the quantity is at par. Food were often bland , service was also inconsistent somedays you felt welcome other days you were just a passer by."}
