{"text":"I have no idea how this place is still open. It was good when you were in middle school and wanted something greasy and cheap. They are over priced for what they have. The staff are extremely rude as well. They have no manners or people skills at all."}
{"text":"Lunchtime! Veal sandwich w/cheese from Mastro's Nick! It was good! I've had better but it was still okay! It was filling! Service was quick! And I love the price! Can't go wrong with 5 bucks!"}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Mastro Nick.  When I got there about noon, it was jammed with school kids eating poutine and getting poutine to go (it was a cheap lunch special).  Videos on TV were crankin'.  It quickly cleared out and I was there only one there for a while.  The volume of the music went down (I hadn't minded it loud).  I ordered a small pizza with pepperoni, bacon and sliced tomatoes.  It turned out it was large enough for two.  I ate half and took the other half home for later.  It was a good hearty pizza and the ingredients were plentiful.  Antonia was the server.  She was friendly and chatty and took good care of me.  I'd go back if I was in the area and wanted pizza."}
{"text":"I hope you don't try and order delivery because the lady on the phone will complain at you depending on the time you order and may turn it away. Also found hair in my food."}
