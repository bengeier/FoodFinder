{"text":"I am a frequent customer of Dub's and I am a fan of the service and unique food.  Excellent wings, great burgers with an awesome \"pretzel bun,\" and nice cold beer!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot to be desired, The staff is under trained, The manager burps in the dinning area and the food is below par. This was the biggest waste of my money in months and I will never go back..
I had there all you can eat fish and chips, They were like rubber with no crust and looked like a nuked boneless buffalo wings I did not eat any of them they where just too gross to eat. Do yourself a big favor and skip this place all together unless you just want to throw your money away.."}
{"text":"Sunday morning breakfast , music well  number one too loud for a Sunday morning I asked the wait person if they could turn it down she hesitantly said yes but never did, as we sat waiting for our food it finally came I had pancakes my wife had a ham and cheese omelet  she brought a disgusting syrup container with syrup stuck to the side with a hair attached to the sticky container, another employ saw the disgust on my face and brought me a clean full container    Thank you by the way unfortunately the pancakes were the same texture as a frisbee and the omelet had micro pieces of ham that were hard to skewer with a fork and some stringy cheese suppose to be cheddar but I have my doubts ........we have had breakfast here before and it's been good ..not knock your socks off good but good  for east Mesa  unfortunately I know have to remove this place from my list of mediocre east valley eats"}
{"text":"My wife and I went on Friday night and it was a very busy place. I'm surprised because every other business in that spot has failed badly. 
The food is good, prices and specials are also good. We had the all you can eat fish and chips. 
I'm not sure why they where playing rap music in the bar when 80% of the people there where retired.
Our server was very good at his job.  Very attentive and good personality."}
