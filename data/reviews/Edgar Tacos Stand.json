{"text":"A friend and I were walking by on a chilly morning when we were drawn in by the smell of Mexican hot chocolate being made.  Perfect timing because we were getting hungry and trying to decide where to go for lunch. Two things I really enjoy, street food and tacos so Edgar's is always a favorite of mine. For this particular visit I ordered a veggie burrito with the works. Ok so my love expands beyond just the taco..really any Mexican, Tex-Mex, Southwest flavors..it's all good. You can really taste all the fresh ingredients.  They really are just the best here.  They offer a variety of ingredients and quick, pleasant service.   Cash only."}
{"text":"YUM! The people here were very friendly while we ordered our tacos, and the massive range of vegetarian options is fab! Instead of just one veggie taco option (like beans and cheese) they had a soyrizo option to compliment the omnivorous chorizo taco.  SOYrizo. Get it? It was quite good.  These tacos are super messy, so don't trick yourself into thinking you can eat and drive with these guys... take a seat nearby and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I always make sure I have cash to stop at Edgar's for a burrito when I'm in the Strip. I keep meaning to try their tamales but always end up getting the chicken burrito. Edgar and his tacos are just fantastic."}
{"text":"Ordered the picadillo and carne asada tacos, and they were delicious, flavorful and fresh. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"LOVE!!!  They just did the catering for my daughter's birthday and it was perfect. They came on time and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"There's none better when it comes to home made taco and burritos! Fresh made right in front of you.  I'll walk past all the great restaurants in the strip just to have Edgar's! Wish they were still in the heart of the strip but I'll still make my way up to 27th St to get my fix..."}
{"text":"Fresh cooked authentic tacos right on the sidewalk, you can't get any better than this! I'm from Texas and my husband is Hispanic, so he can vouch for me when I say they are legit! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Very ethnic no taco bell here...the taste gave me a sensation of Mexico all i needed was a margarita or sangria mmm  so i bought a pure watermellon drink straight from the mellon....would recommend..."}
{"text":"I always hear so and so has the best tacos or you have to try their tacos... let me just say this no thanks.... EDGARS FOR THE WIN!!!!! Hands down THE BEST tacos in Pittsburgh.   When you are within a 2 block radius of Edgars and you smell something drawing you in and you say to yourself \"What is that amazing smell?!?\" It's Edgars, I can assure you!   Edgar has a little stand next to Pamelas diner in the strip. The taco selection here is amazing. He always has specials which are highly recommended. I always get tacos, it doesn't matter what type, but make sure you get tacos! Once they grace your lips you will understand why Edgars is rated 5 stars across the board on yelp!   I also recommend getting a horchada drink as well, best I've ever had. If you have ever had horchada you know how delicious it is, if you've never had horchada then Edgars is the best place for your first ever experience.   I am literally licking my lips drooling and my stomach is rumbling just from writing this review thinking about Edgars tacos even though I just ate. I will be heading there first thing in the AM! PLEASE do yourself a favor and put Edgars on your list of must have tacos in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and my chicken taco was outa this world.  Everythin was so fresh and prices were good.   The salsa had the zing that I look for. I will no doubt be heading back.    Thank you Edgar Tacos Stand!"}
{"text":"THE BEST! Added a couple of pictures of the burrito. Man this is really it! Chipotle Grill eat your heart out. What these couple of folks do in a small stand on Penn Ave. is flat out amazing.   Today is first I had the burrito, just like the best you can find in SoCal. Loaded with flavory goodness!  I would go on, but about to reheat another one. Let the pictures do the talking.   Oh, and when you reheat a burrito on flour tortilla, wrap in foil and either bake at low heat or wrap in foil and reheat on stovetop."}
{"text":"Moving to Pittsburgh from L.A. I was skeptical as to where I would be able to find a taco stand. A coworker suggested we stop by Edgar for lunch. Edgar went beyond expectations. Fresh ingredients and made right in front of you. Bonus points for the salsa bar. Only $5 for two tacos. I look forward to becoming a Edgar regular!"}
{"text":"Best taco stand in the Burgh! My first stop at Edgar's was about three years ago.... I was walking by the stand and saw Troy Polamalu (no joke) sitting with his family at a table out on the sidewalk enjoying tacos, so of course I had to stop! I must say, Troy knows what's good! Their tacos are incredible! So fresh & delicious-- and affordable at only $5 for 2. Over the years, I have tried all of the tacos they offer and they never disappoint! The fish is prob my favorite -- and def try the free salsas they have on the counter! The salsa verde is excellent. One bite of Edgar's tacos & you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"I've followed Edgar wherever he has a restaurant a small stand and now this place. Super tasty, lots of great salsas, fyi you can buy them by the pint to take home the Chipotle being my favorite.  Whenever visiting the strip I pip n for a couple days f tacos. Reasonably priced at 2 for $5 , in fact had some for breakfast when biking through the strip today. Deliciosos!"}
{"text":"Lets talk TACOS kids.  No, I don't mean those crappy wanna be Taco Bell type tacos ... I mean real, honest to goodness, fresh off the grill tacos.  Beef, steak, and chicken .... with almost any topping you could conjure up in that taco fueled mind of yours. Fresh as the day is long ... what?  I already said fresh?  Well I guess it deserved a second mentioning then didn't it? Everything is fresh ... Everything is awesome.  Edgar makes the world a little better with his awesome food.  I work 1 block from this place and sometimes I walk by just for the smell, 98% of those times I don't even make it a block before turning around and indulging my addiction.  That's right boys and girls .... Addicting is a word you could associate with Edgar's food.  Do yourself a favor ...... Go grab some REAL tacos, burritos, and every other \"o's\" you can find here.  The \"o\" is for HOOOOOOLY Frijoles this place is wicked awesome!!"}
{"text":"I have to give 5 stars on this one.   I've been eating Edgar's tacos since they first started and it's crazy how consistent they are.  I don't know what classifies \"authentic\" Mexican tacos, but they literally only sell tacos (and a burrito I think) and English is not the first language of anyone here, which for me are always the required components of \"authentic\" anything.  This place is the Standard for tacos in Pittsburgh.  Get'em all... but I'm partial to the lamb and beef tongue."}
{"text":"After trying most Mexican restaurants & food trucks in town, Edgar's tacos are the most amazing tacos in Pittsburgh and are very authentic. I crave them on a regular basis.  I've had the chorizo tacos multiple times. What I like about his chorizo tacos are they are delicious and flavorful, but not super greasy which is the case with most chorizo tacos.   The shrimp in the tacos are small and fried, but equally delicious.  I like how he has multiple salsas you can put on them.  Even though I'm obsessed with his tacos the hibiscus tea was to die for. I could drink that every day. Soooooo good!  The other great thing about Edgar is he is extremely friendly and his staff are as well. They are also very efficient.  Like most taco stands in town, you either have to stand or take them with you. There is one small table inside, but that's it."}
{"text":"Yes Yes Yes!! Great tacos and great service every time!  Also some days he makes chili relano  which isn't super cheap but his chili relano is absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Edgars tacos.  I am just fine sticking with the beef but the chorizo looks amazing.  2 tacos for $5 is a great deal.  The tortillas are made fresh, and the tacos come topped with onions, tomatoes, lettuce, crumbled Mexican cheese, sour cream, fresh cilantro and freshly squeezed lime juice. I could easily eat here every day. Edgar and his staff are always so friendly.  The best part is with his new location, parking is me readily available and there is a couple places to sit inside! I already can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE. Yes, it deserves the capital letters. Come here for tacos. Practice your Spanish with Edgar. Enjoy taco heaven. There are no other words to describe it.   Oh. They are cash only (no ATM). And you order inside before handing the slip to the people who make the tacos outside. And then it's a short wait until the taco gods shower you with yumminess."}
{"text":"Edgar's is the real deal - possibly the most authentic Mexican style tacos you can find in Pittsburgh. Edgar is very friendly -- try your Spanish on him if you speak even a little. :-) This is an order outside and eat standing up on the sidewalk, take with you, or stand at the window bar inside to eat type of place. Very casual, and delicious. The options are little meat heavy, so may be difficult for vegetarians. Note that Edgar also has quesadillas, burritos, and other Mexican foods."}
{"text":"THE BEST tacos around. There is not much to them, yet they are so flavorful and fresh. My favorite tacos are the shrimp with everything on them, of course. We became Edgar fans when he was on the street up from Pamela's Diner. It was almost the perfect location, since every time we would enter the strip we would walk past and buy our obligatory tacos. When we realized he relocated, we were disappointed at first, but we learned that he has a closer location on Penn Ave and one that's further down the strip on 26th street. The workers are friendly and accommodating and his newer location has a sign out front saying they now cater (I don't remember this at the last location). I'm so happy they are expanding and look forward to many more taco stops this summer."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Edgar's Tacos!!  I can't even begin to count the number of times I've been there.  They use all fresh ingredients and the salsa is amazing. Never a bad experience.  If you're in the strip district, it's a must try!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one day and really enjoyed it. I tried two of the shrimp tacos (without cheese or sour cream) on corn tortillas. The price was right and the flavors were super fresh and delicious. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"The smells coming from the stand are amazing - then the tacos are yummy and authentic. Love the Strip District eateries."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try out the tacos from this place, and I finally received the chance to do so this weekend.  I visited the Strip to try some of the hot chocolate from Mon Aimee (alas, it was out--apparently, they run out around noon) and visit a winery, and was not planning to order food.  However, as I walked around the corner on my way out of the winery, I was seduced by the smell of roasting meat, despite it being around 4pm.  I ordered two tacos, one chicken and one carnitas (pork), with everything, which cost $5.  When I ordered, the guy at the stand (Edgar, I assume), asked me if I wanted anything to drink, but I passed.  As I was waiting for my order, two women came up and ordered some tacos, and one also asked for a cup of the hot chocolate, which made my ears perk up (why did they not mention that drinks meant hot chocolate?!?).  Of course, then I had to get some hot chocolate, too!  Upon receiving my hot chocolate and tacos, I sat down at one of the adjoining tables to consume them.  True to their claim, the tacos were some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh--the only other ones as good that I've had are from Las Palmas in Oakland.  In fact, I ate the chicken one so quickly that I didn't even think to add salsa to it, but it was still delicious!  I added salsa to the carnitas one before eating it, which made it all the more flavorful and delicious.  Both of the tacos were savory and crispy, and I greatly enjoyed them both, though I slightly preferred the chicken one.  The hot chocolate, which was a Mexican version with cinnamon, added a nice sweet note and finish to the meal, and filled me with warmth on this chilly day, helping to make up for the earlier disappointment from lack of the hot chocolate that I'd sought.  Aside from the quality of food, the service was very friendly and pretty efficient.  The only drawback is that this is a food stand, which means that if the weather's unfavorable, you're stuck eating outside.  (Of course, there's nothing they can do about this, hence why I'm not detracting any stars.)  Given that I live and work in Oakland, Las Palmas is generally more convenient when I'm craving tacos. However, when I'm wandering around the Strip and am hungry, Edgar's surely hits the spot!"}
{"text":"I braved the heat n humidity, because I'm greedy ......but even after sitting on my desk through 2 meetings, it's still!      I feel like I'm in San Diego circa '85......Yummy  $2 TacoTuesday"}
{"text":"Yes! Just go and check it out. My favorite foods are simple, yet expertly prepared. These folks know how to make authentic tacos and they are delicious. we had the chicken and pork and both were fantastic. I would give them 5 stars if they started making their own tortillas or at least bought from a small place versus the bagged Mission brand... in any event, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Three things you should know:  1.  IF I HAVE A PULSE, I WANT TACOS.  2.  This is the taco stand around the corner from Reyna's.    3.  After writing I got so excited for tacos I rescheduled a work meeting to get tacos.  THESE ARE THE BEST TACOS IN PITTSBURGH.    Not Casa Rasta (barf), not Reyna, not the Pgh (I Hope You Like Waiting in Line for Underwhelming) Taco Truck.  These.  Right here.  So good.  I dont mess around when it comes to tacos.  These are the ones you want.  You dont have time for lousy tacos!  The last time I was there it was the ground beef tacos (2 for $5), and a crab meat empanada.  It was so good, I ordered a second order \"for a friend,\" and then went around the corner where they couldnt see me and ate the 2nd order.  Everything is so fresh and they make tacos the way I would , if I could make awesome tacos.  Cilantro, lime juice, queso fresco....  Okay I need to go get tacos.  You need tacos too.  This is the best cheap lunch in the Strip District.  And the guys who make the tacos are just...so friendly and funny--they are straight up delightful.   What a strange way to describe someone.  They're really cool guys.  The other day I went to get tacos and the chorizo special he was cooking smelled so outrageously amazing I told him, \"If I could cook like this, I might finally find a husband!\"  He made sure I watched him make it so I would know how.  What a sweet guy!  I like giving them my money!"}
{"text":"If you love tacos go here. They are amazing and the people are super nice there. I literally eat here no less than twice a week."}
{"text":"Delicious! Reminds me of my hometown, LA. Hands down the most authentic (and tasty) tacos in Pittsburgh.  I liked these tacos so much I had them cater (yes, they do catering!!) a work event, and everyone went wild! They were very friendly, professional, clean and punctual. They also handled our tax exemption form nicely. All in all, it was a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing! You wouldn't expect this much from a little taco stand but their food is absolutely delicious. You order your tacos and then they have a little cold cart w condiments that you can add to your tacos. Even if you don't want to eat a full meal, at least try to stop for one.   Edgar's used to be on the corner of Casa Reyna but they moved up the street and now have a small truck in a parking lot. If you go further up the street you will come to their tiny shop. Their hot sauce is amazing and their pickled veggies add a good crunch to the tacos."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Pittsburgh 6 years ago, one thing I found lacking was good Mexican food/tacos. Well that's all changed in a few short years. For me the only place that rivals Edgar's is Doce taqueria in the South Side and Edgar's is significantly cheaper, so I guess that makes them the winners. Great, hearty, simple tacos that hit all the right notes. Will definitely be back regularly!"}
{"text":"It's strange to me how this taco stand is basically around the corner from Casa Reyna's stand, basically being an \"in your face\" type of competition. The setup seems fine though, and I frequently see customers clambering over both. That said, while I haven't been to Edgars' main restaurant, I can vouch for their stand. Their variety definitely beats Reyna's stand, while prices are a tad higher. In addition to all sorts of tacos (including fish and shrimp!), they have some choices of empanadas, quesadillas, etc.  Tried the carnitas, carne asada, lengua, and barbacoa--all were delicious, and you can tell them to put the toppings of your choice while they make it (asking them to put everything is by far the best choice). The guy who takes your order is super friendly, with an \"hola, como estas\" for every customer. They also have watermelon agua fresca and horchata, both of which seem freshly made; the watermelon was delightful. Finally, while the wait may be a little longer than other stands, there are some complimentary chips and salsa for you while you are waiting.   10/10 would return again."}
{"text":"The BEST tacos in Pittsburgh.   My girlfriend is a connoisseur of all things Hispanic- the culture, the food, everything. We've been to 8 Latin American countries between the two of us and we both agree that Edgar's taco stand has the best tacos we've tasted. I recommend the chorizo. Oh, ad he has horchata! A must try for anyone who enjoys authentic foods."}
{"text":"Saw this truck at yArt and tried a vegetarian taco that had mushrooms and potatoes with lettuce, tomato and onion. Sooo good! I've never had mushrooms that tasted like that. It had a kick and a good flavor. I wish I could figure out how to recreate it with spices! The corn shells were not overly thick, hard or rubbery. They were perfect.  The people on the food truck were lovely. They had 4 types of salsa, forks and napkins readily available. I added the medium salsa to a portion of my taco, and it went very well with it. I hope I see this truck around again sometime!"}
{"text":"I feel like such an ass for not giving them five stars but hear me out: The food is seriously to die for! There's no way this isnt the best Mexican food in Pittsburgh... and if it's not, PLEASE recommend a better place on this review, so I can see it.  However... It's simply not enough food. I had ONE meal from here that I hated, but I dont hold that against them. Aside from that, I've never had a bad experience here. But for the price, it is not enough food!  Here's a tip: Order beef lengua burrito/taco(s). It's so amazingly supple & tender, while still having that intense seasoned beef flavor! Because of these guys, I will never eat a beef taco again...unless lengua is on the menu!"}
{"text":"Right in the heart of the Saturday afternoon market on the Strip, Edgar's and the competing taco stand just around the corner contribute to one of the best smelling street corners ever, with sweet and earthy tendrils of corn tortillas wafting by and hints of the various meats cooking on their griddles.  With some of our brunch targets packed to the gills on a beautiful Saturday afternoon, my girlfriend and I switched to snacking at the various food stands on the Strip, with Edgar's being the main stop. I went with a chicken and lamb barbacoa tacos and their watermelon agua fresca to drink. The lamb was lightly topped while the chicken was more generously topped, while you're left ot finish it off with the salsa of your choice, and I just went with what looked like salsa verde.  Sitting down at one of the handful of tables next to their stand, we dug right in. The lamb was tender and flavourful, and the sauce it was in kept it from getting too dry. There was a little bit of spice to the guac and a nice fresh pop from the pico and all of that was evened out by the queso fresco. The chicken had a mild flavour, but it was tender and moist, and topped equally as well as the lamb.  The watermelon agua fresca was fantastic. It tasted simply of watermelon with very little, if any, extra sweetening, just letting the fruit stand on its own.  Edgar's was an excellent spot in a equally great little area. Hit this place up if you're in the Strip."}
{"text":"Edgar came to my work the other day and it was totally great!  I had the lengua tacos and a beef empanada.  Not only was the food delicious, the salsa was awesome too.  I always like spicy stuff and the hot salsa delivered and had a punch of garlic too."}
{"text":"This is a pretty typical taco stand in the strip. They make a good taco that tastes like what a taco should, and generally are pretty good (and fast) about it.  My order had a few different types of tacos and they all tasted pretty good. Honestly it's a taco stand, and it's good, there's really not much else to say."}
{"text":"This is a cute little taco stand next to Reyna's on 21st.  I ended up stopping by here with my fiancé for a light afternoon snack after our lunch wasn't enough food for either of us.  The stand wasn't too much to look at as it was a couple of things cobbled together but there was a sign proclaiming their tacos to be the best in the city.  As such I decided to go with a chorizo taco while my fiancé went with the shrimp at $3 each.  The man behind the grill cooked both of them up fresh while also warming the soft tortilla shells.  He asked us if we wanted everything on them and we both said yes not knowing what everything was. It ended up being some lettuce, tomato, cheese, sour cream, cilantro, salt and freshly squeezed lime juice.  I ate my taco right after receiving it and it certainly hit the spot.  The temperature of it was perfect while the chorizo had a nice kick and my favorite part was the lime juice which gave a nice little sourness to combat the heat.  My fiancé also really enjoyed her taco and the shrimp that I tried was good.  The bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  They had a number of interesting tacos, burritos and empanadas that I noticed on the menu that I am sure I would love."}
{"text":"This place was such a hole in the wall, but really good. It's actually a lot bigger than I was expecting. You walk-in, order from the menu on the wall, and then wait at a table with the number they give you. They shout out the # when the food is ready and with a simple wave of your number the waitress found me and brought out my food. Since the ordering is at the front and there was only 1 cashier, the line got a bit long since my group was about 20 and there were also other patrons. This occurred around 3:00 on a sunny Saturday.  The food was really cheap, and it was good. I could have gone for more food since it wasn't a huge serving, but it hit the spot and accomplished what I set out for. There's also free chips with guac and queso.  The inside had lots of decorations drafting down from the ceiling, as well as stuff on the walls. It made it feel like an authentic Mexican place. There was also futbol playing from the World Cup which added to that element.  The owner said that the liquor license was delayed about a month. I wasn't able to order a Corona, but anticipate by late July or August that the drafts will be flowing. At least I hope so for their sake. Either way, it's a cool place to check out near the strip."}
{"text":"Simply the best and most authentic tacos in Pittsburgh. Add friendly service and a smile and that's Edgars."}
{"text":"Tasty, delicious and friendly service!!  Great little taco stand in the middle of the Strip District.  Cash only."}
{"text":"this place is amazing the price is right the place is clean and edgar is a very nice man!  love this place"}
{"text":"After leaving California and the glorious Mexican food it has to offer..I thought I had condemned myself to taco hell when I couldn't find decent tacos around town. Enter Edgar and these marvelous tacos. I was at the Strip with a friend on a recent cold, fall (but basically winter) day when there wasn't a lot of foot traffic on the street. We were starving and crabby. I walked past Edgar Tacos and stopped in my tracks. I saw the Mexican hot chocolate being stirred, my eyes got wide at the sight of salsa, and the smell had me salivating. I ordered two chicken tacos with everything and boy was it so worth it. I didn't even care how cold it was anymore. These were it for me and I ate them with incredible joy. The salsa was fresh and the chicken was cooked perfectly. I'm going back ASAP!"}
{"text":"These are the most delicious and most authentic tacos ever! So glad I'm able to get food like this in Pittsburgh!!"}
{"text":"By far the best tacos in Pittsburgh! Order the barbacoa,carnitas,or fish tacos! They are very authentic and I love that you can customize them with your own salsa at the salsa bar. Highly recommend going to the strip just for the tacos here!"}
{"text":"Great option for outdoor wedding party/reception!   We booked Edgar's to cater for our marriage celebration at Riverview Park. We can not be happier with the reservation process, service, and food! Edgar sent three people to whip up hundreds of made to order tacos in a couple hours. We also had beans, rice, chips and salsa. We had a variety of diet preferences and requirements and everyone was able to get their fill without issue. We received a flood of compliments on the food and atmosphere, but really Edgar's deserves our highest recommendation and gratitude for providing such great food paired with fun and professional service."}
{"text":"I first tried Edgar's Tacos the day I returned from a trip to Chiapas, Mexico. My soul yearned for something authentic and I found it here! The ingredients are fresh and the flavors are truly Mexican.  And I could speak Spanish with the nice foks behind the counter! I go back every week and take my friends and visitors to Edgar's.  I recommend the whole menu heartily."}
{"text":"Great spot for authentic Mexican fast food! Tacos were very fresh and delicious! Great prices and food, can't beat this local spot! Definitely coming back for more"}
{"text":"Make sure you have cash because you CAN'T MISS THIS AMAZING TACO STAND! We would go back every day if we could. It's our favorite place on the strip to eat.  I always get the 2 chicken tacos with everything on it and add your own salsa in the salsa bar to the side of the stand. There are two picnic style tables to sit at. They also have cheap specials that you can try including empanadas, etc. They're very friendly and sweet. The quality is always consistent. You can smell the deliciousness from blocks away."}
{"text":"Only the best taco stand in the burgh. There's actually a few great Mexican restaurants in the city but this taco stand is UN. REAL. In fact, if you have ever been to California and had tacos in LA or San Diego than this will be an exact experience. These ARE LA tacos. I recommend the carnitas."}
{"text":"Tried Edgar's at a food truck rally. The tacos were amazing. It has become a goal to stumble upon this food truck again."}
{"text":"Accessible, quality, and fresh are words that come to mind for Edgar tacos. I'm a fan because they meet my standards, offer vegetarian options that are substantial and delicious - i.e, they aren't just limp vegetables on a taco shell. I go for the soyrizo tacos always or refried black beans. I kept trying to show a friend who was in town how yummy these are, but we seemed to miss them every time!   Ingredients are fresh and flavorful. I haven't had a bad experience yet, and it is all cheap and quick. It doesn't get better than this for \"fast\" food tacos, plus it comes without the gastrointestinal disruptions later on, if you follow."}
{"text":"Good tacos at a good price, $5.00 + tax for two.    Fresh ingredients and about 6 different salsa's that are labeled ( a real +). Had the carne asada, the chunks of meat were tough and overcooked, probably not a good choice since steak tacos at most places are tough and overcooked.  Also, had the carnitas taco which was very good, a much better choice.   Edgar seems to have some specials for the day but found the day I was there that the menu only had 4 taco meat choices and would prefer a another option.  There is the option for Tostadas, burritos and a few other Mexican selections.  Cash only."}
{"text":"So friendly and the most delicious tacos I have ever had! I cannot wait to go back! 5 star review hands down"}
{"text":"Delicious treat during your afternoon in the strip district! The picadillo tacos are awesome! The savory flavor of the beef with the fresh pico de gallo and cool sour cream is tasty! The cheese and squeeze of lime at the end cut through the richness of the meat and sour cream and add a lot of flavor! I also love the use of the corn tortilla instead of flour tortillas! Always one of our stops in the strip district, and will always be one of my favorite tacos in Pittsburgh!!"}
{"text":"You guys if I could have the tacos and sauces injected in me I would. Edgar's is in my top two places for tacos in Pittsburgh. Everything is fresh. Always fresh. The flavors are so aromatic. I swear I get dizzy from eating this goodness. One bite and my head spins. Have to grab a quick seat to maintain my composure so that I may continue to inhale those tacos as though I've never eaten before."}
{"text":"The tacos are very tasty--I'd say the best you'll find in Pittsburgh. I am docking them a little because I think they are a little pricier than what I would like. But I try to get to their location whenever I am in town."}
{"text":"Tacos are not usually a huge hit with me when I go to a Mexican restaurant - I like them, but they are usually not exceptional. The tacos made out on the street outside of Reyna Foods in the Strip - awesome, and definitely the best tacos I have had anywhere. The ingredients are all great, but the grilled flavor of the tortilla and the fresh ingredients, included the freshly squeezed lime juice, complete everything and make every bite wonderful. The beef tongue and fish tacos were fantastic. Also, if you like some heat, try their homemade sauces in the big plastic jars at the end of the line. Now this is street food, baby!"}
{"text":"Great choice for authentic tacos , burritos etc . Had pollo and a lengua (beef tongue) taco and all of them were super tasty and freshly made right in front of me. The workers inside were very gracious and helpful so it made the experience even better. I'll be back to try some different stuff they offer like the marinated lamb quesadilla which sounded great. Great place at a very decent price for tacos ."}
