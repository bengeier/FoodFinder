{"text":"This restaurant had terrible service. Our server was rude, slow and grumpy! It felt like he didn't want us to be there. I had the burger, and it tasted good, but it was so drippy that it was falling apart in my hand before I could finish it. Also, their Caesars are nasty."}
{"text":"This place is a gem I can't believe it's in our neighbourhood. Food is really good. Been for dinner twice. On busy nights you'll need a reservation. Our server was new, or at least he seemed that way, and he had to check with the chef on everything we asked, and hadn't tried anything on the menu. Regardless, we will absolutely go back. Great cocktails!"}
{"text":"I used to live in this neighborhood and hang out here every night. Service is amazing!! Everyone always called me by my name, even the cook who I had never really talked to lol. Food is also amazing. The butternut squash gratin is just a side, but i often order just that just because it's amazing! Try also the Duck confit and the Involtini, you won't regret it. Cocktail list is not my favorite, but always ok, with many refreshing and creative cocktails, but not too many boozie spirit forward options. Decor is cool, more on the hispter side, and feels cozy in there. Bartender Molly is the best!!!!!! I will keep coming back"}
{"text":"I brought a friend here to celebrate getting her permanent residence. We showed up at 9:30pm on a Friday and the place was busy but not packed. Service was fast, friendly, hip, and provided by whoever seems to be the closest. The ambiance is sort of the \"new foodie\" vibe (it's okay, I want to punch myself in the mouth for saying that): a lot of natural textures, wacky urban decor and the chefs are right there in front of you instead of back in a kitchen. 

The burger was epic in a way that the word \"epic\" does not do justice. For $20 you can order one of each of their five sides, so do that, get a glass of wine or two, and enjoy your evening. Well worth it, and I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Friendly, welcoming servers.  The music is very loud.  Great cold asparagus salad.  Disappointing flat iron steak with too much gristle. Would return to try other things."}
{"text":"If this was near me I'd be here all the time. 

Went for a friend's birthday and was running late. I was the last one to squeeze in at the table and normally that means you fall into this weird no-mans land of service (which you deserve for arriving after everyone else) but despite the restaurant being packed the server came to get my drink right away, grab me a chair and set me a place. 

The burger was amazing. One of the best I've ever had. Huge, juicy and delicious. The side of fries was also great. I had a crazy sundae for dessert and it was also great. 

Service was great - our server knew the menu inside and out and was very helpful and prompt, difficult when the restaurant is that busy. 

Good prices, good food, good service and a laid back casual vibe. I'll be back."}
{"text":"best place to eat at lansdowne and bloor. 
love the burgers and the shoe string fries. 
the wings on wing night are the best i've ever had."}
{"text":"Just what the #altms team needed after a fact finding mission. 
Friendly (read \"flirty eyed\") waitress made us feel welcome. Beers were tasty and the radishes crisp. Baguette was a tad small but the cultured butter made up for it. 

Definitely an oasis in the hood!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  I love the buck-a-shuck on tuesdays.  Last week and friend and I went in and had oysters, a cocktail to start off the evening.   
We both had our eye on the steak which comes with a few mushroom and lots of jus... very delicious.  We also got all 5 sides which is the way to go.  We had the brussel sprout slaw, fries, squash, rapini and a beet dish.  It was amazing and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I went here last night for a friends going away dinner. The food was AMAZING! Our server was also super friendly and down to earth. We all shared a bunch of sides. The pasta and the fries supreme were to die for. I ordered the crispy chicken with olives as my main and it felt like I was indulging in some high class KFC, it was awesome. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"More like a 4.5

Three friends and I visited the Emerson for the first time last Friday. The initial seating was a bit of a mess but this was quickly forgotten. We ordered some drinks and dropped $20 on ALL of the appetizers. Yes, this is an option on the menu. The sweet potatoes with bacon and micro greens were amazing. The fries and aoili were very nice and everything else was fine. Great oysters with delicious hot sauce. Lovely seafood chowder.

The environment was unpretentious and warm. The staff was friendly and accommodating and the menu items were priced lower than one would expect for such a consistently nice experience. 

I'm very much looking forward to returning to try the hunter's pie and enjoy a few more beers."}
{"text":"I walked past the lineup at Starving Artist, then again at Whipporwill and stepped into an empty Emerson for the brunch, which is from 11-3 on Saturday and Sunday.  I'm truly surprised there is such a huge wait list at those places, although I understand the appeal.

We were the first people at The Emerson at 11:10am and there were empty tables around.

Simply put, the best brunch for under $40 (for 2, which includes tax and 20% tip)

Ordered:
Regular breakfast with bacon, sausage, baked beans, toasted french bread, fries
Spicy Lamb Shank Eggs Benny, fries

Such great care goes into each item - the eggs perfect, the baked beans smokey and flavourful, and the lamb shank (not spicy really) tender and laid over two full biscuits.

All with great service from a chap eager to please, yet not in our face whatsoever.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"I love this place! Food is yummy and atmosphere is so cool and hip! I had spicy lamb shanks. Not too spicy but has nice kick to it. My husband had steak which was cooked to perfection. Meat was tender and seasoned really well. We tried all five sides and they were excellent. Can't wait to visit this place again!"}
{"text":"All the above things still stand true. BUT, the owner is a surly looking dude that gives me the evil eye every time I go there. What's up with that!?"}
{"text":"We tend to go to a different place almost every day to eat.  Rarely, very rarely trying the same place twice.  The atmosphere and decore is very nice here, service was a huge step above the majority of Toronto restaurants.  My girlfriend got the daily pasta, spaghetti with duck, and before she was half done she said we're coming back here.   She's the picky one between us so this is a very good thing.  We tried the Brussell sprouts... Not for us but good.  Then the squash came... Get this.  If for nothing else, stop in and get this.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"What a pleasant suprise at the corner of Bloor and Lansdowne! Went on a Monday night so missed the crowds I keep hearing about. Good service, great food (arctic char), just the right ambiance for an uncomplicated evening, ...and I love a place that gives a teetotaler like me a fancy Italian soda option ;)"}
{"text":"After walking past the unmarked storefront, I was intrigued by the antique motorcycle in the front window, the mini oil lamps glowing on the bar and vintage road bikes hanging on the wall. It was a Saturday night around 8 pm and I was new to the area so I decided to go in for a drink. The hostess that greeted me was very friendly and the staff seemed professional and attentive to their guests. 

When I asked for a cocktail that wasn't too sweet, she recommended a \"Wallace Sour\" ($11- Beefeaters, Benedictine, and Spice Syrup). It was delicious and I could have easily drunk another! 

I loved the warm, rustic ambiance of the open kitchen behind the bar, and unfinished woodwork and brick walls. Next to the coat hooks and beside the bar is a magnificent long-horned cattle skull. Folk music sang softly in the background. Most, if not all, of the tables were full and people were very mellow, so it was not loud. Customers ranged from mid-twenties to mid-sixties, so it caters to a range of ages, but I wouldn't suggest it as a good place for kids unless they are quiet, well behaved and self-entertaining.

Would be a perfect place for a group of up to ten people or a date for two. I went solo and definitely felt out of place. The two female bartenders were attentive but not very gregarious, so I spent my visit observing and listening rather than engaging. 

While I did not order any food, the group of three sitting besides me did and they raved about their rare burgers and brussel-sprout with bacon side. I glanced at the menu and everything sounded delicious. I will certainly go back and try out one of their daily pies!

I did notice that they don't open until 5 pm, so this clearly an evening affair."}
{"text":"Food was good. (ordered whole fish and steak) service was fair for a busy Friday night. Didn't make reservations and was told that I need to return the table in an hour and a half, yet I didn't feel rush at all. Had apple tart for dessert, a good way to end the meal."}
{"text":"I've been to the Emerson twice now and both times have had a excellent experience.  The mixed cocktails are good and not too girly,  the wine selection is excellent.  Their cheapest bottle wine is a Rioja which is delicious.  The first time i went I started with the Sweetbreads which were amazing.  I had never had sweetbreads before so I was a little nervous but they were great.  I passed them around the table and everyone liked them.  The last time I was there, i noticed that they don't offer it standalone anymore and that it's now a \"sweetbreads poutine\" which i'm not a huge fan of.

The lamb shank is delicious, big, and falls off the bone.  The paper bag pickerel is equally as amazing except a little small."}
{"text":"We booked the back room for my husband's 30th birthday.  Everyone had an amazing time.
We interacted with many staff and they were all helpful and friendly. They have a great drinks list and we tried some new things.  
The space is quirky (in a good way) and it was quiet enough that we could hear each other.
We ordered 4 platters of food and all of it was amazing.  They even sent a bit extra, just because!
We loved the whole Emerson experience and will definitely be back.  Many thanks for making our night so special."}
{"text":"No, I didn't enjoy this experience. I was with a group and the waitress didn't really seem equipped to deal with a group setting. Even though the restaurant wasn't busy, she rarely came around our table, meaning it took forever to order anything. The music they were playing was grating, an embarrassing top 40 radio type mix, and loud enough that we couldn't talk without shouting across the table - something that other Yelp reviewers haven't mentioned. I actually selected this place based on Yelp reviews and now question people's radars for pleasant dining experiences as I'd never return here for dinner. 

All would have been forgiven if the food wasn't completely over-spiced. Myself and 3 others at the table ordered the same dish, the vegan special, and we all found it to be insanely overspiced - to the point that people were having coughing fits. I understand they specialize in meat, but adding too many chilies to a veggie dish doesn't give it flavour, it just literally makes it impossible to eat. When the waitress asked me how my food was I said \"it's really, really spicy\" hoping that might spark some concern, but she just smiled and walked away. If we hadn't have already been sitting in there for an hour and a half when this happened, I would have asked them to remake the dish as I honestly have never been in a restaurant where the food tasted so - just totally wrong -  but with the terrible environment we just wanted to get out. I asked two others who had ordered chicken and meat how their meals were and both were unimpressed, though I will say that a few of the sides we got were very good so there is a ray of hope. 

We ended up going down the street to 3 Speed for a drink and I regretted not just eating there since the environment was a thousand times more inviting. The Emerson is like visiting a restaurant that someone from a very small town imagined a cool New York restaurant would be like but unfortunately just got it all wrong. For instance, I heard they used to have a motorcycle parked in the window. Need I say more. Avoid if you have taste, a 2 star restaurant trying to dress themselves up as a 4 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch last weekend and fell in love.  The food was delicious.  I ordered the smoked brisket hash and it was to die for.  My boyfriend got the lobster benny- equally delish.  The decor is hip but not over the top, the serving staff were attentive but never hovering, and we never felt rushed. Can't wait to make this our weekend brunch spot."}
{"text":"So good. Dangerously close to home."}
{"text":"Loved it here and am still waiting for a chance to go back! Being the ultimate downtown gal, I am very guilty of not trekking out northwest for dinner very often, but Emerson was worth the trip. I was surprised that for it's high-level-hip-ness, there was not a wait (lots of seating!) and that not many have reviewed this place. It's hard to find on the world-wide-webz as well.

As the other reviews have accurately described, the decor and ambience of the place was just to my liking (come and tell me you don't love bicycles on walls - I'll hipster kick you) and the food was yum and fairly priced. The thing about the menu was, it made me want to order everything.  The option to do all the sides for $20 was tempting, but I would have exploded from all the food. We did try the brussel sprouts and the gratin - loved them. I had the Emerson burger which was giant and filling. The first few bites were awesome. As I am not the world's biggest burger eater, I felt slightly defeated but make sure you try it if burgers are your thang. 

We tried the cocktails as well which were good, but can't remember which now - I'll update when I go back and check out the menu again (one with ginger beer maybe?). As I think back, service was definitely not memorable but everything else was. So, I'm definitely a fan.

Atmosphere - 5/5
Service - 3/5
Food - 4/5
Price - 4/5"}
{"text":"I live in Bloordale and The Emerson is one of my favourites.  Have eaten here at least 15-20 times in the last 2 years and it is always amazing.   Service is top notch, laid back vibe.  

Cocktail list is awesome.  They have a bunch named after other restaurants in the area which I thought is pretty cool.   Try the Coat D'Albret cider, it's a bit pricey but great. The wine selection is usually really solid as well.  

Food is consistently excellent.  Lamb Shank, Burger, Gnocchi....all amazing.  Saturday Night is Beef Wellington night which is by far my fav dish.   All of the sides are really tasty.  Cauliflower coleslaw is great and they have the best frites.

Decor is eclectic with some really cool art (local artist Elicser did some cool stuff in there). 

An excellent dinner for 2 for around $100 (or more if you get deep into the cocktail list).  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best fries I've ever had. The Brussels sprouts are also amazing. Good choice if you out with vegetarians"}
{"text":"Just had dinner there.  Sat at the bar.

Drinks: I usually stick to the classics, but I tried the cocktail special (bourbon, thyme, cherry heering, lemon) and really liked it.  Didn't drink any wine, but the wine list looked interesting.  I spotted a California winery that I knew when I lived there but have never seen in Canada.  Slightly impressed by this

Food: the menu is meat heavy and so sparsely written that it's hard to know what to order.  We ended up getting the spicy lamb shank and the burger, with fries and brussels sprouts with bacon for sides.  The cheese sauce on the burger was so messy I had to eat it with knife and fork, but I ended up mopping up the last bit of the sauce with the last bit of the bun.  Then I ate all the sprouts and bacon with the serving spoon so that I wouldn't have to share.

We'll go back some day, but this section of Bloor is turning into the new Parkdale so we have a bunch of new places to try first."}
{"text":"What's with not having a sign outside? I could not for the love of all that's good and holy find it!

So I walked around creeped out by the surrounding sketch until finally FINALLY!!! I found it!

Ok... Once you are inside it's cutely eclectic and... Rather dim for a first date...

Either way would have settled in nicely except for the fact that the lovely waiter didn't even ask for a drink but rather assumed we were planning on ordering a meal and delved into all that was on the menu - to my dates despondency...

Needless to say neither the date nor the eager waiter gained any points.

Points lost for pushy waiter, creepy surroundings and no SIGNAGE!!!

Point gained for decor

Maybe I'll venture back to try a meal. Maybe not..."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday evening. Got seated right away. Some dishes are slightly pricey especially for the portion. Great ambience, some music playing in the background, interesting things on the wall. 

Food: 7.5/10
Chefs Special (7.5/10): This chef's special was a stuffed spinach and ricotta ravioli with shrimps in a pesto based cream sauce. Taste was good, but could use more ravioli, shrimps and sadly you could barely taste the ricotta. 

Butternut Squash Gratin (9/10): like everyone says, it's pretty amazing

Fries (8/10): not just your average fries. They come thin, and nice and crispy. Nice aoili to dip it in as well

Brussels Sprouts (7/10): decent but lacked a 'delicious' factor. Seems like something you could easily make at home"}
{"text":"Well heres the thing. Had it not been for the awkward \"mishap\" that occured during the start of our meal , we would have probably had a better time.. However ..

to make a long story short. group of 10 people went for a birthday dinner, we ordered the 3 course menu for us which involved: fried calamari, a pasta dish and a meat and veg dish. The food was OK...; honestly very standard calamari, pasta was home made but the sauce incredibly watery and bland.  Yes the meat at the end was fall of the bone but i found the seasoning all around very weak and unimaginative.

now for the awkward incident, it seemed as one of our guests was chewing his calamari it tasted like peppermint. spitting it out he realizes its someones chewing gum that had been chewed and deep fried... disgusted we tell our waiters who look shocked and were unable to say anything. when taken back to the kitchen all i could see as a reaction from the staff? laughter... they found it hilarious... 

We ask for the manager who comes and is incredibly confused and shocked. The manager literally not once apologized, just kept asking what happened then would stare at the table silently in response or going \"ummm\". He then offered to bring us another calamari dish, which we refused. Then he claims \"ill investigate\" and that was it from him for the rest of the night....

he never came back to check on us, never offered us anything, never even tried to ensure that we would possibly return to his establishment.. whenever he did walk around our table to serve others he would literally never look our way.

This incident is completely unacceptable, had it been any other day i would have walked out from the  start but out of respect for my friends birthday i stayed. And WOW is the food ever slow to come out. we honestly were there for over 3 hours? 

So there you have it, sub par food , create decor, just look out for gum in your food :)"}
{"text":"I went to The Emerson with my extended family (about 8 of us) making a last minute reservation that they happily were able to accommodate! Having heard nothing about  this place before we came (only knew they were new-ish in the neighbourhood) we were pleasantly surprised by, literally everything. Excellent wine list and beer options, and the food - oh the food! I had the Sunday roast which happened to be a pork chop and it was amazing. 1 at our table had a burger, the other a steak, 2 fish dishes and everyone else ate the Sunday roast and loved everything. We ordered every side dish for the table to share as well. 

Our server was so friendly and patient with us as some in our party arrived tardy and then we couldn't decide what to eat. He made some great recommendations for food and drinks. Perfect portions, satisfying and well seasoned food will bring us back to the Emerson and recommending it to friends."}
{"text":"It's a good local. Haven't had a bad experience service is great. I tend to stick to the plainer dishes an easy environment . I love the gnocchi however u spell that."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and it wasn't too busy. Granted it was a Friday of a long weekend though. 
What stood out to me most of the place was that the staff was exceptional. They were quick, super friendly and would often check in on us.
However I cannot give the same praise for the food. We ordered a bunch of things off the menu, crispy chicken, lobster pasta, lamb shank, sweet potato gratin, shaved brussel sprouts, involtini. 
The best by far would be the lamb shank, which is very similar to a Vietnamese beef stew. 
Crispy chicken was super salty on the skin side, sauce was ok and the raw veg pairing didn't add much. 
Shredded Brussel sprouts was just cut up raw Brussel sprouts made into something like a Caesar. 
Lobster pasta, I felt the pasta was a little over cooked. But other then that the taste was good. 
Involtini was interesting, meat wrapped in meat. But again too salty. 
Sweet potato gratin was exactly what you would expect. 

There is a lot of potential to their dishes but I often find the saltiness overpowering and detracting from the overall taste of the dish or that the dish was lacking something. 

We did mention the saltiness of the food to our server who unexpectedly gave us a free dessert which we selected the ice cream sundae. Unfortunately, there wasn't much special with the sundae. Just your typical vanilla ice cream with whipped cream and chocolate syrup. There was some straw berries and cherries in there too but nothing too special."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and was impressed. Relaxed atmosphere, simple menu, great food.

Would go back for sure. Not a lot of alternative options in the area so was happy to find this place."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place, they are just really consistently good.  They may not blow your taste buds away with unpronounceable ingredients but you will leave very satisfied.   Beef, chicken, fish they cover it all(not sure about vegans, but that's not my concern).  Great selection of beer, interesting cocktails.  I like the service and atmosphere.  Would go back frequently, although a big part of that is because it's a 5 minute walk from home."}
{"text":"Pricey but delicious. If you're willing to spend a bit then this place is totally worth it. We got all the appetizers and sides, so we got to try quite a bit of what they've got to offer and boy was it amazing. 

Drinks are INCREDIBLE. Great drink list and skilled bartender, which is a huge bonus for me. 

Servers are pretentious hipsters but that doesn't phase me anymore, very unsurprising to get a blasé server at a delicious trendy restaurants these days. So that didn't bother me at all. I got my drinks on time and the food was timely and more importantly delicious. 

I live close by so I go once in a while but if you're in the neighbourhood for a great meal then come here"}
{"text":"First-time trip to Toronto to visit friends who live around the corner, and they say they're going to take us to their new favorite place, The Emerson. Walking in, I like the decor but it reminds me of many new hip places we have in Cincinnati that alternate between good and average, and all kind-of overpriced so I had my reservations. I'll never be so presumptuous again! We all ordered appetizers, main courses, and dessert and shared everything. I kept expecting the next bite to be unimpressive... it never was. I can honestly say I have never had that much food at one place ALL be THAT good. The greens and kale salad were out of this world. The brussels sprouts were fantastic. The lemon/olive/chicken dish was literally the best chicken I've ever had in my life, and I'm genuinely upset I can't just go get it any time I want. The mayo with the frites was great. The ravioli was some sort of magical concoction of asparagus, ricotta and poached egg and it was incredible. I don't even know what in the hell dandelion root ice cream is but I ate it and it was delicious. The staff was super nice and laid back, which makes you feel way better about ordering fancy things you might not be familiar with. I've heard they switch their menu out seasonally, so it looks like I'll be in Toronto 4 times a year."}
{"text":"We love The Emerson. 

The drinks list is great and the friendly knowledgeable staff will help to make sure you get what you're looking for both in a cocktail and food. They've got a great choice of ciders which always makes me happy.

The menu is interesting and seems to change often. Steak Tartare, if you're a fan, is always a good choice, with interesting flavours it's obviously made with lots of care. 

My favourite part of the menu are the vegetable sides. I think they run about $6 each or you can get 5 for $25 so we usually do that. The choices are delicious vegetable treasures, with excellent tomato salad in the summer, squash gratin in the winter, grilled eggplant. They're all so good. I could go on and on. Their oysters are also a good bet. Their mignonette is lovely and their house hot sauce is delish and crazy hot. 

The Emerson is a great place if you're into sharing which allows you to try so many more of their goodies!"}
{"text":"Attended opening night with my wife.  Amazing sliders, meat pies and oysters; great ambiance, professional service and super friendly owners.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"So Last night I went to the Emerson... Wowza. How have I not been here before.

I love that Bloor and Lansdowne is transforming and great places like the Emerson are popping up. 

We have one of the friendliest people serving us. He was helpful, knowledgeable, and downright cool. I only wish I could remember his name.

We opted for the Meatball Parpadelle, all of the sides and the crispy chicken. Let me just start by saying, the squash dish... it will forever be in my dreams. I am not a big squash fan but this could be the best side dish I've ever had in my life... That's saying something.. I mean I'm 30... That's a lot of sides I've been thru.

For the drinkers, they have a wide variety of beers including \"features\" which we tried and were delightful.  I also have no complaints on my Manhattan either. 

Great place, great vibe."}
{"text":"I had a great time here last night! Perfect hang out to relax with friends and enjoy a good pint. Love the atmosphere and decor here it's unique and funky. Great deals for food and drink! They only have  limited beers on tap but all choices are nice options. A huge shout out for their fries-- The seasoning is amazing and we pounded through three portions! The music they play is a great mix and fits well into the atmosphere. Best bar in this neighbs for sure!! Definitely will return soon!"}
{"text":"Loved the service, food was pretty good. Had the chicken marsala but it had olives instead of mushrooms, which was a little strange. The side of brussel sprout salad was pretty good. Started with the kale caesar which was amazing. Overall, food good, but quite overpriced. I think you should get at least one side included with your main, at least a starch.  Unfortunately, we won't be back but only because of the high cost."}
{"text":"Tried coming here a few months back for burger week, but there was a private function going on (cool spot for one).

Finally, found myself in bloordale again and was immediately seated for dinner at 9pm on a Friday.  Restaurant was busy and kind of a cool casual vibe with a jitz table at the front.  I had the kale salad, which was good but a bit on the oily side, and the lamb shank + gnocchi as my main.  For once there was more meat than pasta!  I found the gnocchi to be a bit on the soft side, but the meat was cooked nicely, was tasty and fell off the bone.  Definitely a recommendation.  My gf had the paperbag pickerel, which we both found had a lot of great flavours but was overall oily.  We ordered a side of the sweet potato gratin which was rich and delicious - another recommendation.

Service was friendly.  Food was reasonably priced and tasty.  I'd come back here again.  They also have a special food item almost every night (it was lobster on friday)."}
{"text":"One of the few places in Toronto I would actually revisit. 

Staff are all very friendly and accommodating. Very laid back atmosphere (chairs could be comfier though!) 

Ordered brussel sprouts, mussels, and pasta of the day (spaghetti a la aoili). Plus squash. 

Brussel sprouts - prepared raw and mixed with sausage and some other stuff. Flavored were all good individually but not complimentary. Server offered to get us something else so we ordered squash. 

Mussels - HUGE mussels, large portion. Boyfriend said they were delicious. Be aware that the sauce is spicy. Came with a side of super salty shoestring fries (that's how I like them, heads up for those that don't). 

Pasta - greasy sauce that was amazing. Had duck and bacon in it. The pasta itself is homemade. Dug into this with enthusiasm. I don't eat pasta much anymore but it's basically my favorite so I'm picky. Very happy with this dish. 

Squash - one of the best things you'll ever have. Sides are $5 each or 5 for $20. We'll probably go back and gorge on just squash at some point. 
Lightly baked, covered in cheese sitting on a cream, thyme, rosemary, caramelized onions and other stuff sauce. Absolutely incredible."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday, staff and service is underwhelming but not in dinner ruining way, just have to ask for water, drinks, napkins and sides 2-3 times before you get them. That being said the place has a good atmosphere which is hard to find in hipster heaven. No communal tables which is also a huge plus. Food is fucking great. Lamb shank was DOING IT. Everybody loved everything. I wish I lived a few blocks closer, I'm pretty sure it would be my neighborhood go to."}
{"text":"Great place for eats and drinks with friends. Gets really crowded and loud, though - but and that adds to a great vibe - just hard to hear conversation. Awesome, warm, dim interior - bikes all over the walls - unique."}
{"text":"Been to the Emerson a handful of times before but tonight was the best meal ever. I was finally able to have their Saturday special \"Beef Wellington\". OMG, like eating butter. BEST beef I have had in who know how long. Our three sides also improved from last we ordered them. Our waiter and waitress were also amazing. The only negative part of the whole experience was dealing with the door host, who also took my reservation on the phone. He was not inviting, kept rushing us and if he ever smiled, I would have shit my pants."}
{"text":"Love it!  Food is delicious, ambiance is great.  There's even a back room for a more private larger group."}
{"text":"Most of the food was really good. We loved our server she was very friendly and on top of everything. But, I don't think I would ever return. I found the food to be overpriced for the portion size. The only portions that were reasonable for the price were dessert (I would even say too big). I would personally rather have a reasonably filling meal with just a hint of dessert. And I love small portions, but the involtini was three 1 by 2 inch beef rolls for $18, and the sides are an additional $6 each. 

Unfortunately we had to send back our creme brulee because there was too much sugar on the top that they weren't able to burn through. So when we broke into it, there was a whole pile of granulated sugar under the surface. I'm sure that isn't a reoccurring issue though."}
{"text":"My only regret is that I didn't check out The Emerson sooner. 

Whenever I go out for a sit-down meal, the service is something that I always appreciate. I came to The Emerson on a weeknight with the standard Parkdale service expectations in mind and boy, was I pleasantly surprised with what I experienced! I sat close to the window along the wall with an excellent view of the clean, exposed brick walls, with personality spilled all over the space. I ordered the special to start (rabbit...or was it duck, stuffed pasta) and the grilled calamari and sausage for my main. The food was presented beautifully (something that I also value in a restaurant) and the portions were substantial.  As mentioned, the service was refreshingly higher class with linen napkins and utensils being replaced after each course. Well done!

Unfortunately I am moving out of the neighbourhood but I will definitely make the point to come back to The Emerson for another meal."}
{"text":"Downgrading them to onestar...there's obviously something fishy about these guys on here gaming yelp...28 reviews in the not reccomended? so many people took the time to write about them and the not reccomeded reviews consist of almost all the bad reviews on here...and the rest are near perfect seems like people trying to off set the bad reviews ....hey Emerson (and friends of) game the system much?...why don't they spend some time making their restaurant better instead of being such an embarrassment to to the neighbourhood"}
{"text":"4.0 stars for service, ambiance and oysters, 3.0 to 4.0 for food, and a finger-wag for lack of signage.

There's no name on the place outside. I know, I know, this is code for we're a hip place, but still. We were arriving on bikes (I assume this is respected as actual bikes are used as decor as this place), which, on Bloor, means you shouldn't really spend too much time sign-reading and staring into darkenened windows of places. Riding into parked cars, getting doored, these can put a serious damper on your evening. We had to walk our bikes back 3 blocks when we realized we were straying too far from Lansdowne. Once you arrive on foot, mind, there is a small, angry-seeming scrawl of \"The Emerson\" written in chalk on the door next to The Emerson's door.

Things got immediately better once we were met at the door, taken to our crazy high big table and got our first round of drinks. Reso for party of 6 and we were the first to arrive. I started with a Toronto cocktail - rye, fernet and chocolate bitters (2.5 oz., $13). I've had the rye-fernet combo with different 3rd ingredients at several other establishments and this one did not disappoint. We tried each other's drinks and my DC got a Toronto on his second round. Friends arrived very shortly and fun ensued for the next several hours. After cocktails, we moved to wine and/or beer (taps were all St. Ambroise; our group was all former Montrealers, so this was familiar - a treat for some and ho-hum for others).

We took advantage of the buck-a-shuck. These were the best I've had in Toronto - many of them were very small, but taste was perfect. I don't often go for the add-ons, but couldn't resist the fresh horseradish, vinegar and even a couple drops of their homemade tomato mix.

I went for the the flat iron steak and the beet-dandelion greens-goat cheese (starter) as a side.

The steak was really good, done perfectly medium rare from edge to edge, was served with a yummy little pile of fried mushrooms and onions and all swimming in a thin, dark, winey gravy. My slight disappointment here was that the steak was more on the cold side than the warm side. I realize that steaks are left to stand to finish them, but there wasn't much of a sense of the grill to this meat, which was otherwise really great. This is a yummy steak at a good price ($21).

The salad ($9) was alright, but too much cheese for my taste, and the beets weren't as dirty and earthy-tasting as I like them (they seemed zapped of color, maybe they were the purple-orangey ones, not the deep deep purples), so I probably wouldn't zoom back to this salad on another visit. I tried my DC's side brussell sprouts and found the same thing - so much cheese.

One of us had a birthday so we sang with dessert, there was a candle and spoons for all. I can't remember the name, but was made to look like a birch log. It was pretty unique - not cake, and also not ice cream, and not meringue... soft and airy, but still with a certain heft. Kind of like a dense Dream Whip log with chunks of stuff? Maybe worth trying if desserts are your thing and you can makes sense of this description. (Might make more sense if I could remember the name.)

Service was consistently good - food came at the same time, drinks were refreshed promptly, all that jazz. The place is spacious, busy, relaxed. A great place for groups. I'd like to try some of the other things on the menu, including the Wellington."}
{"text":"Came again for Dinner and it was just as amazing as the brunch. With the lights dimmed, and a hustle bustle of people, it's a completely different vibe. It's comforting, hipster at the same time, just down to earth good food. 

I would recommend, if you were two people, to share a main, and order all the Sides ($20) and share everything. Everyone seems to rave about the sides. We didn't do this and perhaps I regret it just a little. All the more reason to come again. 

I got the Spicy Lamb shank served with a side of Gnocchi. It was excellent - fall off the bone and full of flavour. The gnocchi was a great complement to the flavourful dish. My DP got the Arctic Char, but she didn't seem too impressed with it. 

For dessert, we both for the Baileys Creme Brullee special ($7) but wish we had shared it, the portion was good enough for 2 people maybe 3 and served in an oval casserole dish, rather than the typical cup. It was smooth and crispy where you need it to be. I couldn't finish, and took mine home. It looked like a giant mush, but it was a great treat later on in the week. 

Great neighbourhood gem, and I would be back again."}
{"text":"Really Emerson! Not only are you a fine poet but you are a fantastic restaurant..... ok, kidding about the poet part. The Emerson is casual (although the cooking staff is jazzed up in vertical stripes and red bow ties... holla!) the price points are extremely low, given the quality of the food (I ordered the chicken... superb!), and our server was a sweetheart, who didn't charge me for my sundae dessert when he was tipped off it was my birthday.

Anyway, just GO THERE!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!! They do it NICE at The Emerson.

We had dinner at the bar, excellent choices for beer, both on tap and by the can or bottle; I had a Pilsner Urquell followed by a great Sangiovese with my absolutely amazing Emerson burger, featuring Beemster cheese sauce and I asked for caramelized onions to add to the standard offering. 

The 'Sides' platter was an amazing deal and absolutely, chunky broccoli (with Beemster Cheese), spicy cauliflower slivers, sweet squash and sauteed mushrooms.

I can't wait to go back and try more.

Service - was friendly and professional and two people from the kitchen came to speak to us at the bar to enquire about our experience.

The kitchen is open and clean. The decor - very cool with brick and wood.

Don't wait to go"}
{"text":"Elegantly decorated with vintage accessories complemented by tall ceilings. I didn't eat the food but saw the menu and it looked good, prices were reasonable. The space is large and clearly caters to a wide variety of clientele: local hipsters & classy boomers. My dirty vodka martini tasted \"off\" but I can't put my finer on it. I didn't love it but I did love the spot generally so 4 starts it is. I'm curious to see what comes of this neighborhood."}
{"text":"We recently celebrated our anniversary at the Emerson and we had a great night! The food is delicious and plentiful, the sides are fun and interesting, the cocktails were stiff and unique. They were totally able to accommodate my Caelic and most of the menu was open to me.

We went on a Tuesday for the buck a shuck oysters: I had the steak and my wife had the trout, we shared the 5 sides....the Brussels sprouts were like a slaw and not my favourite but the eggplant was delicious. We had the mousse for dessert and it was quite tasty, not overly sweet.

Overall it was a very nice dinner at a good local spot, I'll definitely be heading back to try out some other things on the menu"}
{"text":"Enjoyable dining venue in the Blansdowne neighbourhood, with a casual but nice dining environment. The front of the room is filled with high top tables, and as you go further back you'll find more standard seating, which is where we sat on our visit. Dim lighting, candlelit tables, groovy music, it's all rather charming from a venue standpoint. Bathrooms in the basement are co-ed but well marked to avoid any confusion.

Drink menu is decent, 3 beers including a couple craft brews at $7 each, a variety of housemade cocktails around $12, and a couple options of wine on tap for $9.50 for a 6oz pour, in addition to other bottled wine options.  

Food wise, nothing disappointed. I  was feeling surprisingly casual and went with the Royale cheeseburger ($18), which is a 2 patty cheeseburger dripping in sauces, lettuce, and pickles, with frites on the side. It was messy, but rather delicious. Definitely in the Top 3 burgers over $15 that I've had, and in my Top 10 Toronto burgers regardless of price. My dining counterpart had the whole fish ($25) and a side of Green Beans ($5). What may have been a touch pricey for its portion, still got good reviews.

All in all, a solid spot for drinks or dinner. I could see this being a good spot for dates, small tabled groups, or potentially even larger groups as the long stretch of tables in the back seems workable to be bunched in that regard. While I'm not raving about it, I'll give it a solid recommendation for all those situations."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised here from the States and was actually amazing! Price point was $80 for two with two drinks not sure why there was $$$ it was cheap! Short rib and fish under $20. Very happy with my meal!"}
{"text":"Attended opening night with my girlfriend.  

Wait.  That was somebody else's line, more or less.

Attended *actual* opening night -- apparently there were some soft opens for friends and family, but this was the real deal.  Tonight.  November 22nd.  So yeah, honest to gosh open to the public The Emerson in all its glory.

And, make no mistake, this place has got some glory.  I'm sure there will be plenty of buzz regarding the renovations and it will be well warranted.  It's beautiful inside, cozy but spacious, all woods (reclaimed?), soft lighting, candles, and antiquey goodness.  A turn of the century sewing machine serves as host station, and an old Norton motorcycle dominates the big window.  Not sure to what purpose, but we liked it!

So, on to the food!

The menu is small and focused.  Vegetarians need not apply, unfortunately, but the food is delicious.  A variety of appetizers (including Osso Buco, perch and shrimp, and more), 5 different sides, a daily pot pie, and six or so available mains round out the dinner options, with a short list of desserts for the decadent to enjoy afterwards.

We opted for the perch and shrimp app, a $20 buy-all-the-sides plate, and the Hunter's daily pot pie of bison, pearl onions, and mushrooms.

The perch and shrimp was delicate and tasty, but felt a bit underwhelming for the simple and small portion presented.  Still, no real complaints -- it just didn't quite match up to the rest of the meal...

The 5 sides included for $20 were awesome.  Shaved cauliflower coleslaw, perfectly fried shoestring fries with garlic aioli, garlic sauteed green chard, pancetta fried brussel sprouts, and the best of the bunch, sauteed green beans that left my lovely dining companion to declare \"I hate green beans, but these are amazing.  Best I've ever had!\".

Finally, the pot pie:  ridiculous.  It might be going overboard to call it the best one I've ever had, but I am at a loss to remember one better.  Ultra tender bison in a thick, flavourful gravy, nice flaky crust... and at $10 give or take, amazing value.  Great job, guys.  I'm stuffed, happy, and impressed.

Our only gripe was the bathrooms, which I won't dwell on -- suffice to say they're kind of sort of gender neutral and poorly labelled, but I suspect this will be remedied to an extent.  As they were this evening, we both felt it was an uncomfortable compromise between high style and communal gender noncomformity.  

But that aside, great experience -- welcome to the neighbourhood, Emerson, may you enjoy plenty of success!

(Note: cash only for now, but we're told that will change very soon.)"}
{"text":"The menu is hella limited but that's okay.  They have some excellent fries and the emerson burger is good.  The cheese in the emerson burger is too prominent though; it overpowers the flavor.  But if you're into blue cheese, you'll love it.  The prices were pretty high, but as I've said before, that's how you keep the freaks out.  This is Lansdowne and Bloor so those kind of tactics are essential.  The ambiance was nice there; it's good for a date.  Make sure you take a look at the menu before you go there. I'm not kidding, you might end up just ordering fries. They don't have things like gravy or chicken fingers.  I wish they had poutine but I guess that's too low brow. The only other thing that was kind of bad was the long wait for beverages and meals. Get the fries though. Seriously. FOUR STARS."}
{"text":"I have a great story about my first visit at the Emerson - so buckle in, this one is a little lengthy.

My girlfriend and I spent a nice day at High Park when we decided to try out The Emerson after hearing great things. I called to see what the wait was like - the person who answered seemed a little cold. I was told that I just had to come in and see. We still went and the place was packed with a decent line. The host recognized my voice, apologized that he may have been curt because it was so busy and ushered us to a table he reserved because he knew we were coming in. 

Our server was amazing, friendly and very knowledgable. Sorry this review is less about the food because it was a while ago and I forgot what we had. But this is what happened - my girlfriend ordered the fish special. About 15 minutes later our server realized he forgot to input the order and in that time the last fish special was sold. No problem, she ordered something else but the server promised that he will make up for it. The host then returned, called us by name and wanted to ensure we were having a good time. Long story short, the server comped our entire meal and also brought us free drinks and desserts. This was all for a little mistake. 

It's hard to come across service like this these days and I would solely come back because of that. But thankfully the food was also really good and I would recommend The Emerson to anyone!"}
{"text":"I was in town visiting friends, I guess this is their \"go to\" neighborhood restaurant. ....it was outstanding. We were greeted warmly and very well looked after throughout the evening. The selection of beer, wine and whiskey, while not huge, is very well thought out. There is something to satisfy every palate. The food was very well prepared. I had the grilled calamari with a very fresh tomato/olive sauce. My friends had the halibut and the trout. RAVES all around!! Apple crumble and Chimera cake (maple) for dessert. We were going to go elsewhere for after-dinner drinks but were so comfortable that we stayed for one more round.  Thanks for an exceptional experience!"}
{"text":"Very hip. Interesting and original menu, ambiance, and plating. Maybe we came in with too high expectations? The highlight of our meal was the bread.  Crusty exterior and soft and steamy interior! Loved and loved the bread. Our main dishes, two sides, and dessert were good but they were not memorable. Was not a huge fan of raw Brussels sprouts, squash was okay but too safe. Lamb was tender but I would have more appreciated if there were more layers of flavour to the entire dish. Tiramisu was great, a nice end to the meal. 

I honestly don't see myself going back because there was not a single thing that impressed me."}
{"text":"Cool decor, very hipster feeling. Food was great and very reasonably priced. I especially enjoyed the cauliflower appetizer which was an alternative to a regular salad!"}
{"text":"Was really impressed with the food and selection here! They have really unique food offerings and not just your typical pub fare. We had the sweet bread on toast, brussel sprouts, fries, osso buco, and burger. I can't find anything bad to say about any of it!  They have nightly specials so we'll have to come back again for sure."}
{"text":"I literally created this account so I could rate this place. Had the back room and did the full course chef tasting with ten + people.
The food was phenomenal and plentiful. I had to be rolled out of there because even though I was full I couldn't resist eating everything.
1. Roasted tomato bruschetta
2. Some cream based gnocchi
3. Eggplant tagliatelle
4. Scallops with fennel and orange
5. Ribeye with bearnaise
6. Lamb shank
7. Shredded brussel sprouts, cauliflower coleslaw and the butternut squash gratin

I'm going back tonight!!"}
{"text":"Food is great here and you can pretty much always get a table. Service is usually bad but the reasonably priced (and delicious) food make up for it. They also take reservations!"}
{"text":"Magic in Bloordale: that's the only way I can describe what's happening in this long-forgotten region of Toronto that is now starting to explode with neat little spots.  The Emerson is the headlining restaurant in this area.

The FOOD: First of all, the burger ($13) is excellent.  It's my second favourite burger in Toronto after BarHop's...deliciously moist and succulent with gooey cheese...it's a 4 napkin event.  Their more serious dishes also have come out essentially without flaws.  The Saturday night special is that classical staple of cooking, Beef Wellington ($25).  It came out with a beautifully cooked steak and a luscious, buttery puff pastry shell.  

I also recommend ordering all of the sides ($25) if you're with a  group of 4 or more.  The  brussels sprouts and fries are excellent.  I would characterize every dish I've tried over 2 visits as very good to excellent.  Lots of consistency.  The ice cream sundae was exceptional.

Not a lot on the menu for vegetarians though.

The DRINKS:  They usually have a small selection of fairly local beer taps which I appreciate.  Modest beer list.  Good selection of wines.  The cocktails have always been strong with a nice mix of classics (with excellent ingredients) and a willingness to put their mixology skills to use off-menu.   And now I'm going to say something very first-world: I love that the employ high-quality ice in their cocktails.  For example, their fancy negroni is served on one large \"rock\" which has clearly been commercially produced.

The SERVICE:  Both servers I've had have been knowledgeable, friendly, and solid.  I really liked the un-rushed pace of service as we figured out what we wanted.  Pacing of the dishes was also excellent.  My only critique is that the host at the front has never seemed very friendly to us, as if he were disappointed that we wanted to dine at his restaurant.  

The ATMOSPHERE:  Very relaxed and casual in a typical retro-modern setting.  Seating is comfortable and the noise levels are appropriate.  The open kitchen is a nice touch, and the staff seem to be communicating well with each other.

OVERALL, this is definitely one of my top favorites in Toronto for high-end casual dining.  Reasonable prices combined with great flavor and consistency will have me coming back often.

A TIP: Make a reservation if you're coming on the weekend...this place isn't so secret anymore."}
{"text":"Delicious food, warm service and an overall lovely time at the Emersons. We stopped by after work for drinks and dinner. They offer buck a shuck from 5-6pm and they had some great in house sauces to accompany them (the mango salsa is spicy and I liked it!). They also had a great special of 5 appetizers for $20. What a deal! They offered things like fries with garlic aioli, brussel sprouts with pancetta, rapini and a corn mix. Their brussel sprouts were a bit under seasoned for my liking but I like how they were shaved thinly and crispy. For our mains, I had the steak tartare. The tartare was accompanied by fries, bread and a creamy yolk to bring the tartare together. Their food is priced well, delicious and local ( from their menu, I assumed this was the case). They also offered a good selection of beers and wine. I would love to come back to try their other appetizers and mains."}
{"text":"I only come every few months to Toronto for work and love exploring new restaurants. I really enjoyed my dinner here, would recommend it to others, and would definitely come back with more people so that I can try more of the menu. Wanting to return to the same place is pretty rare since my list of places-to-go keep on growing, but this one will be on my \"repeat\" list.

The decor of the bar is rather hipster, eclectic and quirky, with wood & brick, bicycles on the walls, and exposed industrial pipes. If you're dining solo (as I often do when I travel for work), this is a great place to sit at the bar and not feel so awkward and out of place when everyone else is dining in a group. The bar area is large and spacious.

This place is best if you come in with a group of 3+ people, so that you can share a bunch of dishes. In the name of research, I ordered 3 dishes so that I could try several things. I came in on a Tuesday night, which is wing night ($10 for 1 lb) and was a bit sad that I couldn't order a smaller amount, just to try it. The bartender was so kind to offer me one of his chicken wings from an order that he had placed for himself.

Chicken Wings (only on Tuesdays, $10 for 1 lb) - Delicious sauce that they made in house, and braised in-house. These are not your typical bar chicken wings; the sauce was an Asian-style glaze, and was not overly seasoned or salty. If you come with a group on a Tuesday, make sure to order these. 

Homemade Pasta of the Day - Ricotta Gnocchi ($16) - Felt a bit on the expensive side, compared to the price of the other dishes, but worth every penny. Not sure how bad eating quarter dollar balls of ricotta, covered in a saffron cream sauce with parmesan cheese is for you, but ignorance is bliss. I wanted to eat every single gnocchi, but tried to control myself by eating 2/3 of the dish. The gnocchi was super fluffy, soft and pillowy and one of the best gnocchi's I've had in a long, long time. I'd definitely get this again.

A lot of the vegetable sides are $6 each, and a pretty large portion for the price. I had the shredded brussels sprouts with pancetta and parmesan and the sautéed rappini with garlic & chiles. I didn't like the brussels sprouts - it was too over-dressed and too salty for my taste. The rappini was delicious and I ate all of it.

My entire meal was around $30 pre-tax, which is not too bad considering I could have probably ordered just one more small dish and had enough to share with another person. Definitely get lots of sides (there are a lot of veggie options), and the gnocchi if they have it on the menu. This place is great - it's like eating at a fancy restaurant with lots of choices and small plates, without all the pretentiousness and without all exorbitant prices.

Looking forward to coming back here again with more people!"}
{"text":"Good burger and that's all really. The gnocchi wasn't great covered in bland preserved tomato and the fried chicken sacked for 20 buck. Cocktails are good here but bring your own fan they don't do AC"}
{"text":"Great spot.  Friendly.  Great food.  Interesting, well executed menu.  Groovy decor.  Not too spendy.  Would definitely return. Try the shredded Brussels sprouts.  They'll change your mind about Brussels sprouts."}
{"text":"Reeeeeeeeally love the food here. The menu changes often and always has goodies I can't wait to try. The braised lamb with homemade gnocchi is probably my favourite meal from there to date, I still have dreams about it.

Drink prices are fair and the tap list/cocktail selection are solid. I love the spaciousness at Emerson in a neighbourhood with great but often over crowded bars and eateries. You and usually find a seat right away and rarely feel crowded or like you're spooning the table beside you (sorry 3speed).

I'm lucky to live so close to this gem."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars which to me is near perfection (relative to price people!) but they place came close. The mains I tried were delicious and they had a 5 sides for $20 combo which you could almost eat as your main meal. All the sides were unique and very good. 

The decor was super fun. The staff while high hipster, were very welcoming and friendly to all. The tables and furniture were all really cool too.

Great Saturday dinner. I loved the place. Worth the trip over if you're not close."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch after seeing how long the line was at starving artist and having a hangry girlfriend situation going on. This place is great!

First of all, no line. Easily got a table right away. Second, their americano is pretty good. Ordered the hash, which had some kind of brisket and oyster mushrooms in it, topped by a few eggs, benny-style. When I asked for some hot sauce on the side, we were brought an in-house prepared sweet habanero suace. A little sweet for my taste, but had a good amount of heat. It did the job of cutting through the richness of the hash.

Service was excellent too.

I will definitely come back. It's nice to know there is a solid place you can go for brunch when all the overly-hyped places are too full - actually, I would just come here as a first choice!

I still need to try whippour will's brunch (a few doors down), based on their dinner menu, they are a contender in the area as well."}
{"text":"Thankfully I'm not one to judge by a book by its cover... or a restaurant by its hostess.

Despite being greeted by a rather unfriendly hostess who didn't seem to have a clue whether a spot for two was available (first not a chance, then maybe, then maybe not, then back to maybe, okay, sit at the bar), and who really didn't seem too interested in helping us, my girlfriend and I had a great dinner at the Emerson.  Maybe she was having a bad night, and granted they were busy, but all you need to do is deliver with a smile and it makes a world of difference.  I'm really glad I didn't let our weird seating experience make me turn around and find another place to eat because the food here is delicious and the rest of the staff was friendly and helpful.

We shared all the sides and each had the nightly special of Hunter's Pie (with duck and mushrooms that night).  With generous portions, wonderful flavours and varied textures, we just couldn't stop eating until everything was gone.  Truly yum across the board.  

I appreciate their price point and that they take reservations (will be doing that next time to avoid any issues at the door!)  My man directs a food network show, and I will most definitely be recommending the Emerson.  They are doing it right.  One more time - yum!!"}
{"text":"Fun fact: this restaurant has a Happy Hour between 5-6PM. It was the perfect way to kick off my long weekend with pals. 

We partook in their happy hour to test out their cocktails and take in their 'Buck a Shuck'. Going through their cocktail list, I would have to say my favourite two were the Caribbean Queen (dark rum, averna, lime, ginger beer, bitters) and the Mezcal Negroni (mezcal, campari and sweet vermout). 

As we arrived, the place was empty. But the place got busier and busier as time went on. And rightly so. The food is unbelievable. First as a table, we ordered the freshly baked bread with whipped butter ($4) and ricotta gnocchi ($16) to share as a table and wow. We couldn't beautifully balanced everything was. And god, we need to talk about that butter. UNNNNNF.

For my main, I ordered the seared pork tenderloin (in a gravy with walnut) and the table shared all the sides including butternut squash gratin, shaved brussels sprouts, onion rings and french fries. The pork was so tender and juicy. The sides were definitely not a side note. They paired so wonderfully with everything.  I didn't want the meal to end. 

By the time we were done, I couldn't believe that we were done. The meal was epic. Literally one of the best meals I had in a long time and quite unexpected. I've been here before, but I think I had forgotten just how much of a gem this place was. 

I remember when Whippoorwill (the former restaurant next door) use to be my favourite, but I think this might have just taken the cake.  Everyone needs to come here immediately."}
{"text":"Great food! Great dining experience! Friendly wait staff! One of the best dining experiences I have had in Toronto"}
{"text":"Love this place! As is the trend they have a pretty meaty menu but there are options for me too as a vegetarian. It's a good idea to get a reservation as they are pretty busy. 

I've probably had dinner there at least 5 times and it's always been really good. I'm really into the decor as well. They have road bikes as art :)"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely to die for. The only reason The Emerson loses stars is for the indifferent sometimes rude and kind of MIA wait staff.

If you're okay with that, get the burger. 


The burger OMG let me tell you about it. The dressing the actual burg the sloppy deliciousness that melts in your mouth as you eat it. 

I find that The Emerson is also a little spendy but they do have a nightly special that is always a good bet. 

In summary go for the food, not for the service."}
{"text":"Dont get me wrong, the food at the Emerson is GREAT.  And priced appropriately, so if you feel like splurging on a delicious dinner do so here!  The vibe and decor is nice, and the menu is well balanced and varied.

Unfortunately, the service is a gamble.  My host was downright rude from the very beginning, and then had no interest in helping choose something appropriate from the menu.  I told him I was in a bit of a rush, and he still suggested me to get the expensive Sunday special prime roast, which definitely took way longer than anything else on the menu!  I know this because the table beside me received all their food before me, which was 5 different appetizers and a main, despite having sat down after me.  Infuriating!  

I understand if you serve like this at McDonald's, but if you want to appeal to upscale clientele I expect some respect and integrity.  I've never had such bad service at a restaurant that purports to be more than just a greasy spoon diner.  I was kind of shocked."}
{"text":"Went for dinner here on a Saturday night.  It was nothing short of fantastic.  When I got the bill all I could say is that they don't charge enough considering the quality of the food.  I tried  sweetbreads for the first time.   Wow they are amazing.   Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The food were ok, but they really need to change their range hood. All my clothes smell like food since I was there. Anyone goes there needs to add dry cleaning charge to their bill."}
{"text":"Went back on another Saturday this time earlier so we didn't need reservations. The servers are really great and attentive. The menu is not vegetarian/vegan friendly; you will be stuck ordering the sides or one of the pastas although most of those have meat too. Luckily for me the kitchen staff was able to modify the pasta special for me. I really hate having to ask to have dishes modified and it would be nice to see an actual vegetarian option on the menu. As well a dish with ingredients removed is never as good as one designed to taste good without those ingredients in the first place. 

Meat eaters you will love this place. Everyone else was very happy with their dishes. Vegetarians you've been warned. If there is a vegetarian in your group I do not recommend this place. I would say this place was more of a 4/5 star for the meat eaters and a 1/2 star for me, hence the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Definitely my goto favorite restaurant. Impeccably cooked seasonal menu.  Always delicious and we'll prepared.

Intimate and friendly service, ready to recommend a new wine, or their assortment of daily offerings.

I've tasted almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. 

Portions are also a good size.

Price is very reasonable considering the quality of the food and preparation.

From specials events to a week night out The Emerson never disappoints"}
{"text":"Been here for dinner a few times, not too many selection but food is amazing here!  Recommend to order a few dishes to share among the group to taste all the delicious dishes.  Few suggestions: Ricotta Gnocchi (in mushroom & cream sauce), Crispy Chicken (crispy skin & flavourful meat), Beer Batter halibut (crispy & flaky), and Seared Flatiron (cooked perfectly).  If you have a big group, you could be seated in a long table in the back room, which looked like it used to be part of the kitchen previously.  The room is spacious with just one long table, there are some random art pieces hung on the wall, and a foosball table. Overall it was a laid back and intimate experience."}
{"text":"I'm fighting hard not to become a regular at The Emerson. However, the lethal combination of the understated casual decor, the (overly) relaxed service staff, and the agreeable price points (for what is pretty much guaranteed to be a scrumptious meal everytime) are all against me. Their day-of-the-week pie listing will make you vow to return again before you've even made your decision about what you'll have that night.

While a decidedly concise menu is supposed to make things easier, I tend to find myself wanting a bit of everything. Perhaps that is why getting everyone to agree to ordering all of the sides ($20) to share is always my first order of business. From there, the half dozen oysters are as good a start as the rillettes or kale and barley salad.

To be honest, the steak is the only main I've ever ordered for myself. It's so rare to get \"rare\" done so well. The Bearnaise sauce is just icing on the (beef) cake!"}

{"text":"We had dinner at the Emerson on a Friday night in the middle of the great 2016 summer heat wave because we couldn't bear to cook at home!

Unfortunately, the AC wasn't working properly, add to that, an open concept kitchen which made the Emerson hotter than a jalapeno's armpit!

Luckily we arrived during Happy Hour (5 - 6pm) for the buck-a-shucks - $1 cold, perfectly shucked Malpeques on a bed of cold, cold ice.

We decided to split a main - fresh slab of pickerel on a cool fennel salad ($19) - and ordered five sides for $20 - frites, eggplant, Brussel sprouts, grilled rapini and tomatoes with bocconcini salad, as recommended by Yelper Laura C T (brilliant suggestion!) in a previous review.

Sides came up super quick and were an extremely generous size!  Loved them all.  Our piece of fish came shortly after but we noticed it was pink and somewhat underdone.  Our friendly waiter took it back to the chef and had it cooked a bit more.

Once the pickerel spent a little more time in the oven, it was fabulous!

We were stuffed by our meal and had little room for dessert, plus I was super sweaty from the hot conditions and didn't really want to hang out any longer.

Loved the food and service at the Emerson.  Note to self to come back in the fall/winter again."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant in an area at Bloor and Lansdowne where there isn't a whole lot of culinary creativity going on. Two of my favourite dishes are the kale ceasar salad and the gnocci. If you're a hard core italian gnocci fan, this dish may not be for you though.

I also thoroughly enjoy the buck a shuck on Monday nights. The two times I went (so far) the oysters were different and they were actually a good size and quality (although I'm by far an expert in this area).

I will be a returning customer"}
{"text":"Ate at The Emerson last week. Shared the burger off the regular menu and the daily special of ribs. Ribs were soft and nicely sauced, did enjoy them but thought a rub might have added a little kick to the meat. The burger was an absolute dream, melty Beemster cheesy goodness. No adding condiments to this one, was good right from the plate. Fries were thin-cut frites which were correctly cooked if you like them thin (I'm a fan of a thicker cut). Service was trying but there seemed to be some kind of division with which they different people were struggling. The guy who might have been a sommelier looked confused when he tried to walk away from the table without taking our dirty empty plates and we pointed this out, as if he thought it was a little beneath him. The waitress was very focused on food but less on drinks. If this is the split, then they still need to work on it a bit. But it didn't really affect our evening too much as this really was a place with great atmosphere and vibe and good food. When they add a few more beers on tap and iron out the service, this will probably be my new local."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Maybe I'm blind but I had a hard time trying to find this place because it doesn't have a name outside the restaurant. Their food was delicious and it is always a tough choice to pick from because whippoorwill is also one of my favourite places to go to."}
{"text":"Came here tonight after noticing the Wednesday wings sign out front. The special was $15 for Buffalo wings which were braised, lightly floured and fried accompanied with a small salad on the side - arugula with thinly sliced radish mixed in a very light vinegrette I believe. The wings weren't crispy, but they were pretty darn tender and provided a relatively clean wing eating experience. I'm not a fan of Buffalo wings myself, I'm a Honey Garlic gal, but I found these really good, not too spicy and the just the right amount of sauce - I still would have preferred an option to wing flavours though. I also ordered fries on the side ($5) which came with a really good garlic aioli. Both dishes came out together straight out of the fryer, and just *drool*. 

The atmosphere was really chill here and it was relatively empty when we arrived so we were given the option of our seating. We went to the back which was a bit dark and hot because it's so close to the kitchen, so I recommend the front, especially on a nice night when they have their store front open. Our server and waitress were very friendly and checked up on us a couple of times throughout the dinner. 

Would I come here again? Heck yeah!"}
{"text":"I read through many of Emerson's reviews before last night's meal, and when boiled down they paint a reasonably accurate picture. Excellent food, thoughtfully prepared menu and drink list, and a vibe in both ambience and service that has teeters on the edge of being a little too cool for school. I take no issue with the de-rigeur Toronto hipster restaurant racket and found this place to be relaxed and cozy, but I can see how it might not run across everyone's tastes, or how some diners tire of exposed brick.

The food, on the other hand, is not up for debate. It was delicious from start to finish. We shared oysters (it was Monday buck-a-shuck) and they were perfectly fresh and the hot sauces were pretty tasty too.  Entrée: I had the osso bucco, which was out of sight. Super tender meat swimming in an extremely flavorful and rich broth. The sides we ordered were also great (and inexpensive in my opinion): brussel sprouts with a nice hard cheese and crispy pancetta were outstanding; creamy eggplant with pine nuts; rapini; fries. The rest of the party seemed to enjoy their meals, with the chicken,  the restaurant's signature burger and involtini all getting great marks. I think the arctic char got a good but not great reception--but I have yet to go to any restaurant where I've been blown away by arctic char. I think it just is what it is--a kinda dry fish--and there's only so much lipstick you can put on a pig. . .a dry fish pig. 

Drinkz: I had a great cabernet sauvignon with dinner. Their gin cocktail I had to start was pretty tart, even for my sour-fiend ways. I wouldn't have wanted it any sweeter, and it wasn't sweet, but it was just a touch too pucker-inducing to taste some of the subtler ingredients.

Servizz: Our server was good if a little brusque, and a little slow--but since it was a long-awaited catchup meal among six, the pacing worked out well. Had we been in a hurry I might have been annoyed. However, this spot doesn't really look like it's trying to give off a digest-as-you're-shown-the-door vibe, so I don't fault it on that point.

$$$: Dinner and two rounds of drinks, with oysters to start for everyone and ample sides, was under $250. Pretty sweet value.

All in all I was very happy with the Emerson and would definitely go back. It's perfect for nights where you're looking to savor good company over a good meal. You should go!"}
{"text":"Why have I not discovered this place sooner?! It certainly deserves a 5 star for their Beef Wellington (available only on Saturdays)! I mean there are many tasty restaurants but very few like this one that would entice me to go back to it again when it's not a convenient location for me. 
 
Restaurant is casual, hipster-like with a simple menu. Apparently there are off the menu special items items like their Rabbit ravioli and Beef Wellington, which we tried. The rabbit ravioli was good, a tiny bit under cooked on the edges. My friend also had a couple bones in his ravioli. We also tried a variety of 5 sides, which were great as well.
 
What stole the show was the beef wellington, perfectly cooked juicy medium-rare fillet steak wrapped in a delicious buttery puff pastry. The ratio of meat to pastry was on point! The green beans which came with it were also a delight, crispy and crunchy without being overly oily and fried. Mix it with some arugula and sour tang from their pickled veg makes this dish a pleasure to eat. My friend had the beef wellington before from here noted that the sides and sauce that comes with the dish may change. She had this white sauce last time and said it elevated the dish even more. 

The restaurant is fairly priced, beef wellington was $25 and you'll notice the chef's attention of textures and flavours. Now I won't be scratching my head anymore when a friend is in town and they want me to take them to a 'good' restaurant. The beef wellington is definitely a crowd pleaser (well unless you're vegetarian/vegan)."}
{"text":"My bf and I have been to The Emerson twice as well and both times we enjoyed our meals and experience tremendously. We trekked from East York/Scarborough to Lansdowne/Bloor and it was worth it! The first time we went we tried 4 out 5 of the sides (which they offer at $5 each or all 5 for $20 if I remember correctly) and they were all prepared well and delicious. The first time I had the pasta special which was tagliatelle with braised pork shoulder and it was also delicious. A simple tomato basil sauce was a perfect match for the delicate pasta and hearty meat in the dish. They also jar their tomatoes in-house! My bf had the crispy chicken with lemon and olives and that was delicious as well. Then last night we tried the 'Sunday Roast' special of prime rib, mashed potatoes, yorkshire pudding w/bernaise sauce & jus. No complaints at all. We also ordered the brussel sprouts in a bacon vinaigrette and they were AMAZING. We also  find the staff approachable and very personable. My only negative comment would be that even though I'm not a big drinker, I do like my Bacardi rum which, unfortunately, they do not offer.

Overall, we had a wonderful experience both visits and we'll definitely be back to try 'Welly Wednesday'.

Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"Very good service and quality of what we ordered was well presented. Just feel like as I have mentioned in other reviews in this area ...if you serve a soup per say (Whippoorwill) you should get a crostini as a method to dip and savour the remnants of what is left in the bowl) you should get a sprinkling of fries when you order a burger ....gourmet or not at this price point for $62 for 3 beers and 2 burgers and adding a side of fries.  I think even in Yorkville I ordered similar and paid a little less but had a nice side of fries.  My humble foodie opinion.  One who believes a menu item that starts with burger should include fries. :-)"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today and had brunch with my husband and our four-year-old daughter. I don't know if The Emerson is a kid-friendly place in general -- or if they want to be known as such -- but they couldn't have been nicer to us.

More importantly, the food was amazing. My husband had the hash, complete with a perfectly smoky and fiery pepper; I had the lamb shank benny (ON BISCUITS; so good) with a great hollandaise; and my daughter had the blueberry-and-lemon pancakes topped with wonderful, juicy blueberries, which she loved. The amount of food was just right, but we (and everyone else in the place at the time) were also given brown butter banana bread on the house and we did not refuse. A lovely and delicious surprise.

We never felt rushed; the music and decor were pleasant; our server was friendly and even brought markers and paper for our daughter when she realized that my kid would need to be occupied while I finished my food (really thoughtful!); and even the bathrooms were cool.

Judging by some of the other reviews, this level of food and service is the norm at The Emerson. Can't wait to return for dinner (child-free; don't worry, everyone)!"}
{"text":"Eating is an experience that involves a certain level of passion, intimacy and romance that goes into making the food to create the ultimate dining experience. I had high hopes for the Emerson but unfortunately as much as I want to love it, I can't. If you ever see a true classical chef they all have a love for their creations that broader lines obsession. They enter the zone and feel the food they make. It's a part of them. With that said, while they clearly have great intentions at the Emerson, the food comes out lacking the romance that it takes to create an awe inspiring experience for the palate. The food lacks salt, and the flavour that leaves you begging for another bite just for the sheer pleasure of it. The seating and set up doesn't really help you feel the intimacy either. There is no privacy, the front is always empty as they are anticipating larger crowds which I haven't seen to date and the motorcycle in the front just takes up room from the possible seating that could be added. Frankly it feels as through your sitting in a food court somewhere and that's not a pleasant dining experience at all. The decor seems to be a mish mash of ideas that have come out to look like a bit of a bad acid trip leaving me confused and  uncomfortable. I know everyone else seems to think the price point is good but if you ask me, these prices are proper for a place that infuses a bit of the creator, the artist that brings the flavours together in a magical infusion. The wait staff is lovely but just not enough to make me forget about the missing romance that a dining experience should have."}
{"text":"A friend have been raving about Emerson (@EmersonToronto) for a while now and saw how packed it was when I passed by when I had dinner a few door down at The Whippoorwill here. We made reservation for a Saturday night and we arrive at a pack space with a very casual crowd including family gathering with kids.

I actually love the space with all the random objects as if a antique shop turn into a restaurant at night. The space was also rather large and go all the way to a back room which you can't even see from the picture below.

 A small open kitchen by the bar which throw out dishes at an alarming speed.

 La Chamiza, Malbec $55

Fried Sweetbread Poutine $9
~ Love everything from the light battered sweetbread to the gravy which was the perfect consistency and flavor to the bits of cheese curds.

 Tartine $8
~ daily special

 Butternut Squash Gratin $5 (side)
~ This is one of the most generous side at $5 I have ever had and it was super delicious.
~ I could easily eat this as my main 

Brussels Sprouts w/ Bacon Vinaigrette $5 (side)
~ This was rather small side compare to the last one. 
~ Note that you can also order all 5 sides for $20.

Spicy Lamb Shank, Gnocchi $16
~ The only thing I had to complain about was that it wasn't the least spicy but otherwise it was fall off the bone good.
~  It was definitely a hearty dish for the colder nights 

10oz Ribeye, Bearnaise, Yorkshire Pudding $21
~ We were both attracted to the Yorkshire pudding and that's the main reason we order this and frankly compare to the lamb dish, it just didn't look as good. 
~ But the Bearnaise sauce was the star here.

Seasonal Pie ~ Berry Crumble Pie $7
~ Love how not sweet it was, actually I think there was barely any sugar used which allow you to get the full flavor of the berries plus the added flavor and crunch from the almond from the crumble on top with a super thin crust.


Verdict :
~ Affordable price with rather large portion
~ Great service, all the waiters kept checking if everything was ok
~ Have to come back for the pot pie and the rest of the sides, speaking of which I am craving for the butternut squash gratin right now"}
{"text":"I went to the Emerson because my sister had been a few times and always raved about the delicious food and good prices. I was there with a couple people. We had the beef Wellington which was the first time I've tried this dish and it was delicious, as was the ribeye with Yorkshire pudding. We also tried the sweet breads and butternut squash au gratin which I would recommend! Each night of the week the Emerson has a different special dish which are all well priced. The drinks were priced normally ($10 each) and were delicious, especially the dirty martinis. For dessert we had a banana split style sundae which was absolutely phenomenal, the caramel sauce was made in house which was a nice touch not to mention delicious.
The ambience of this restaurant is very hip, thy played really great music and the layout and design of the restaurant is very cool. 
Also excellent serving staff! 
I would absolutely return to this restaurant and recommend it to anyone looking for amazing well priced food"}
{"text":"Wonderful, just wonderful. Everything from the app assortment to the house made ravioli was absolutely splendid. Atmosphere
Is great despite the high hipster count. But I guess it's a gastric pub which sort of comes with the territory. 

I would give it a full 5 stars as really the good was quite spectacular but it's a bit in the pricey side for what you get. Although it was fresh and everything hand made It still doesn't justify the high $$."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me to The Emerson as a birthday treat to try their Saturday special... The Beef Wellington!!!! We're major Gordon Ramsay fans so this was a big deal!
Anyway... this beef Wellington has got to be in the top 3 dishes I've tried in Toronto! It was so so so good! Worth every penny (I think it was 30-something... $34 maybe?)
The Emerson looks and feels like a hipster British pub, like you would only come for the drinks but actually their menu is quite good.
Great service - good looking staff too 
Go try their Beef Wellington!"}
{"text":"Went here for a b-day dinner with JYB. It was a Sunday, so I selected the roast dinner (happened to be prime rib) and she had the lamb shank. Both were pretty solid. The roast was a little cold, but the flavour was bold. Not a big lamb fan myself, but JYB said it was pretty close to the top. 

We went with all of the sides for $20

Fries - standard, but done well
Shaved Cauliflower Coleslaw - unique and a bit spicy
Brussels Sprouts w/ Bacon Vinaigrette - were a bit burned, was disappointed
Salad - top notch
Butternut Squash Gratin - nothing too crazy

I'm glad we tried all of them, would want to give the sprouts another shot. 

For dessert we had bread pudding, never been a big fan myself, but this was solid.

All in all, a pretty good meal and the service was great!"}
{"text":"The Emerson is located near Lansdowne and Bloor a step away from Lansdowne subway station. I dropped by the restaurant on a Saturday night at around 6:30pm a few weeks ago and the place slowly got busier and busier as the night went on.

Both my partner and I ordered the pate special to share as an appetizer and we both got the beef wellington special as mains. The pate was great although it would have been ideal to have a few more pieces of bread! It paired really nicely with the glass of red I had ordered. The beef wellingtons were cooked well and the sauce/gravy that came with it completed the dish. It's a big portion so come hungry if you'd like to finish it all. There were also some fingerling potatoes on the side so make sure you come hungry! We opted for no dessert as we were both too full.

Overall, friendly and attentive service and good food. A bit on the pricier side but a good treat for a night out."}
{"text":"Amazing place.   Food was spectacular as was the vibe.    Great attention to detail and great value."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Everything I ate was amazing. The atmosphere is nice and the decor trendy. The side dishes were all tasty, I think we ordered every available one. For main, I ate the whole fish (which I am still thinking about now). I also tried some of the Saturday night special (beef wellington), and, although it isn't really a beef wellington in that the pasty is simply placed on the top it was delicious. Taste wise I cannot criticize the place. 

I have afforded 3* based on the service at the end of the meal. It took around 35 minutes from us asking for the bill to receiving the bill (although we were waiting for our waiter for around 15 minutes prior to that, but he was no where to be seen). After almost 20 minutes after the bill had been finally dropped off the waiter was absent again, so we had to ask a waiter from a different table to help us pay the bill, which he did immediately. 

It was a Saturday night and we had plans after dinner. It was around 11 when we finally found our waiter to ask for the bill but it was almost midnight until we were able to leave. The restaurant was not at its busiest at this time, there were empty tables, so there is no excuse."}
