{"text":"Awesome experience! Just moved here from New York and it feels like home! I recommend this for anyone who loves Indian food!"}
{"text":"We had the Pao Bagji and it is not your typical one. It tasted more like curry then pao badgji. As for the chaats, the house special was good. The service was a little slow, but their chai was good and even comes with while package of biscuits to go with your chai. Very nice touch. Over all, food was good."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food in the Valley! THE BEST for Indian chaat and yummy thali. \"Consistently\" serving good food :)"}
{"text":"Must try Indian place!  Specially try the paneer kathi wrap and vada pay!"}
{"text":"Get rid of the crappy Styrofoam plates and cups and you have customers. Styrofoam combined with hot food is carcinogenic and thus turns me away from this place. Look at pastries and chat they have recycled material plates. Change it or people will stop coming"}
{"text":"Had the wraps for lunch.. yummy.. mmmm.  What a change of pace from fat american food.. and taste great too!  Everything on the menu is around $5 too."}
{"text":"We are total rookies when it comes to Indian food but we were curious to try it. We stopped in on a suggestion from a work friend. The young lady working the register (who I believe is the owner) spent at least 5 full minutes going over the menu with us and answering every question we had. The price and portion size allow you to try a few different things instead of having to commit to one more expensive large portion. We had two wraps, a curry dish, an appetizer, and a sweet fruit drink for $21.  We really enjoyed them all.  The only thing I didn't like was the disposable plates/bowls/silverware."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Cooks seem to be new but food is improved than beforr. Do not get sugarcane juice - its tasteless. Pavbhaji is weird as well. We liked samosa chaat and pani puri. Cashier is a bit slow and everything seems to be single threaded."}
{"text":"Lotus deli offers the best chaat in town. A must visit and their vada pav is the best in the valley. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Wow, the food here is awesome and the service is superb! The man taking my order asked if it was my first time there and explained some of the basic meals to me. He easily veganized the meals I picked and it was out fast! The prices are GREAT. A new favorite spot I'm glad it's so close to home."}
{"text":"Whether you're looking for friendly service, delicious vegetarian options, or authentic Indian street food, Lotus deli is EXACTLY where you want to be! The menu is full of delicious dishes all prepared in the kitchen. Pictures and descriptions of each dish scroll by, informing customers of price and content. Everything is prepared fresh for you when you order it, and it is all reasonably priced and portioned! The atmosphere is cozy, charming, and well-maintained. The smell of cardamom and cumin drifts softly from the kitchen as Bollywood hits play frequently on a nearby flat screen. The customer service is wonderful, as those behind the counter are eager to help you make a decision, inform you about the menu, recommend goods in the market, or even offer a trip to India! (I kid you not.) Lotus deli wouldn't be half of what it is without its strong leadership, and it shows in the great food! You should definitely stop in, the food is great!"}
{"text":"Glad we found this place. Generally not fans of Indian food but we tried a few things and it was alright. They have sugar cane juice! Could drink this by the gallon. Unfortunately it's a little expensive. In Hawaii I can buy a gallon for $18. Here it's about $50. In India it's about 20 rupees if I remember correctly. We'll definitely go back for the cane juice often but don't like paying the premium price."}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian Indian street food/meals that won't make your wallet cry in pain.   I've been to Lotus Market more times than I can count and have managed to avoid the temptation to eat here. However, I decided to indulge today and went straight for the Dahi Puri ($4.49 + tax). There were 8 puris filled to the brim with sauces, yogurt, potatoes, onions, and I'm pretty sure I tasted beets in there too. The only way I can describe it is..It tasted so so so so good. It could be the fact that it was after a long day at work, but the taste was so pleasing. The service was surprisingly fast as it was not even 5 minutes after I sat down that my order was ready.  All of the items on the menu are vegetarian and many are vegan. Dahi Puri is not vegan. I usually see a few people eating at the Lotus Deli, however, it was just myself and someone else when I went. The decor is really cute and all the colors on the walls brings out the Indian theme. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is been bookmarked by me long back and somehow we found to go on a sunday evening. They got the grocery store and the deli tucked side by side and initially when we stepped in there was no crowd and the place looked empty. However , I wanted to try and ordered some aloo tikki chat and samosa along with their mango lassi.   For the prices they quoted, I would recommend this place for a snack munching and you will not be disappointed. Alos they got a freezer section in the restaurant offering a small quantity of togo boxes of kaju katli, rasgulla,cham-cham etc.   Over all my experience is satisfied and it can be repetitive in near future;-)"}
{"text":"I love their food! I always come here to get their vadapaav and I tried the rose lassi for the first time and it was alright but little too sweet for my taste. It's pretty clean and spacey. Oh and the price is super affordable. But only has one worker for the front so you got to be little patient but not bad enough to bother you. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The food is filled with flavor.  You should try everything on the menu and then going shopping at the market.   Food at the cafe is vegetarian but you will not miss the meat.  Every dish had a unique flavor that will pack a punch.   Keep in mind, the market has a loyalty program so make sure you sign up."}
{"text":"Good Food, Friendly staff, reasonably priced, clean and most importantly connected to the largest Indian/South Eastern Grocery store in the Phoenix area...................Perfect place to catch a quick snack ( Indian Street Food ) or even a authentic vegetarian meal ........killing 2 birds with one shot.........Dining out & grocery shopping at the same destination without sacrificing quality of food or over paying for grocery."}
{"text":"Amazing Indian street food! I eat the lunch special and there is a ton of vegan options available to me. It's cheap, tasty, and vegan. I'm in love! The store it's located in is super cool as well."}
{"text":"Lotus Deli is nestled inside Lotus Market, and there are a bunch of tables for you to know it's a dining area.  The name Deli is appropriate in a non-American food style way, for the low key nature of the food here.  However, the laid back nature should not be translated to the food.  As I watched the food preparation through the window into the kitchen, I heard the microwave warming, heating and beeping.  I didn't hear the sound of anything being cooked or saut√©ed - no sizzling sounds atop the stove.  Maybe this is because it was prepared earlier in the morning or before dinner time.  Either way, when my food was done being prepared and was not piping hot, it translated to me that it wasn't nuked enough in the microwave.  Aside from that, let's talk about the food.  There were quite a few choices, and the prices were quite fair.  I noticed that the patrons were receiving portions that were heaping full on their plates, which left me surprised why my portions weren't like that.  I also noticed that the menu is filled with both vegetarian and vegan options, but you can have it vegan if you want it.  There are not a whole lot of fresh veggies in the cuisine, but the flavors are pretty tasty.  The one thing that i didn't like was the salt level was a bit high for me.  However, the flavors were satisfying.  Really though, for the price point, it is a steal - get the thali!  The people know what they want when they come here, and it's a no frills meal that will be filling.  It's not stellar, but it'll do for a \"deli.\"  The staff here seems to be relatively nice, and quite helpful."}
{"text":"Walked in on a whim.  Glad I did.  Place is SUPER clean.  Indian market has everything you need to make curries, samosas, roti, etc.  TONS of spices.  What surprised me, was the restaurant area.  I had no clue what to get.  The gentlemen was so nice and helpful.  Explained everything in detail.  I ordered a paneer wrap.  Boy was it GOOD!  I split it with other person since I didn't know if I'd even like it.  As soon as I took first bite, I wish I didn't split it.  The wrap was made from scratch.  Not from any package.  The wrap had Indian cheese also made by them.  It had spices, peppers, onion, cilantro and two homemade sauces.   This little market is a hidden gem for those in Mesa/Chandler who LOVE Indian food. The menu isn't that big, but what they offer are items that you see typically in India called \"street food.\"   I read they also do Vegan dishes.  The glass case also had some nice deserts and Mango Lassi drinks.    The owner came out and asked how everything was.  She said the store will be offering Indian cooking classes very soon.  I know I would love how to make this dish I had today at home.  I will be back again very soon."}
{"text":"Love this place! Once a week I want an Indian food fix but I don't like lunch buffets because i end up eating too much and suffering the rest of the day. This place has thali specials which are wonderful because you get a taste of a few things.  It is vegetarian but you won't miss out on the meat."}
{"text":"This rating is an average of food quality, wait times, and customer service.  Food quality itself would give 3 stars. Wait times can be really a lot on weekends.   Finally, customer service is awful. We ate at this place before closing once, hardly much customer's left. I forgot my jacket and walked out, they were almost close, with no customers at the deli. 5 mins after that I found on the road that my jacket was hanging from the chair where I was sitting. We called and told them to keep the jacket, and we will collect next morning. They told us, they never found anything, nobody in the deli or in the store. It was obvious that was stolen, there are no CCD cameras in the deli to catch this. I would highly recommend to be careful about your belongings if you are eating here. The store management was not at all helpful. It was a fairly high priced green jacket, and we felt bad about it."}
{"text":"I'm a bit new at Indian food but being a vegetarian I thought I would try this place out. I'm hooked, the food is great. Wonderful flavors, large menu and great prices. I had the Aloo Tiki Chaat which is my favorite . The Vadapaav was very good also. There is so much more I want to try there.  The only negative would be the person behind the counter wasn't the friendliest but she wasn't rude either."}
{"text":"Amazing food, the paneer wrap and thali butter masala is to live for and they coffee is delicious. The cost is so minimal for the portions. I always have lunch left over! Still my favorite Indian food in the valley."}
{"text":"This private little Deli is a perfect stopping point to get a quick bite to eat when you don't want to deal with a large restaurant or buffet setting. They have veterinarian dishes mainly of local Indian street foods including samosas, lassi, spice chai, parathas, roti, dal, bhindi, various thali's and other delicious snacks. The prices are very reasonable and the service is quick and friendly. The deli is located within a supermarket where you can purchase most all Indian groceries and produce."}
{"text":"Food is good and cheap. They cater to my vegan diet really well, pretty much have at least 3 - 4 vegan curries everytime I go."}
{"text":"Good place for Indian snacks. A place for food, not for ambience and service. House special chat is good for those trying this out. I really like the choley bhatura, but they can improve by increasing the amount of choley served. Would strongly recommend the chai or coffee."}
{"text":"Thus is probably my favorite Indian restaurant in the valley. I've tried most of their curries (with roti) and they are all really delicious. Haven't yet tried their chat but intend to soon. Finally, a measure of a good desi restaurant I think is the tea/chai they serve and the chai here doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Very unique and different.  Nice. They will explain the dishes. Very helpful. Clean. Wide variety of foods."}
{"text":"Had halwa poori bhaji and sugarcane juice. The place is not fancy. But food is very good. Still thinking about the bhaji.  It was really tasty. Unlike other Indian food cafes in and around phoenix. I just hope they maintain the taste."}
{"text":"This is a good place to have actual Indian food. They dont have a full menu, its more like a snack place! I tried the pav bhaji and paneer roll. Pav bhaji was nice, a little spicy and the Paneer roll was exceptional. I am not a big paneer fan and yet I loved it. Also try the masala chai, its very good!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times and never bothered to write a review. Decided to write a note today after being impressed yet again.   The deli is inside the grocery store and their service is a little slow. So that gives you time to walk around and get your groceries while the food is ready.   The food is always fresh and portion size is right for the price. Spice levels are occasionally a hit or miss and can be higher than expected so do let them know if you like your food milder.   The curry combos are a must. I've gone through all the curries and like the eggplant and paneer the most. They do have a special occasionally as well. The Vada pav and samsos are great. Love the chai here too.   Today I tried the combo chat which had papdi chat, samosa chat and aloo tikki chat. Also got the bhel phuri, aloo paratha and vada pav. More than enough for 2 adults to leave stuffed and for under $20."}
{"text":"Nice place, pretty fast service but not fast enough to make you think that they microwave everything.  The curries are a bit spicy but they can make them mild per order. I like the desert a lot and I've been to many Indian places. Everything is also very affordable"}
{"text":"OK this place is a serious diamond in the Haystack kind of place. First of all the people are extremely kind and go out of there way to make you feel at home. The food is out of this world. Fresh clean and made with true love. They have many options to choose from. I recommend looking at there specials and asking many questions when they are not busy. Otherwise step aside and just blindly point and you will be HAPPY."}
{"text":"Amazing food. My husband and I were in the mood for chaat. I had Papadi chaat and had Samosa chaat. It was absolutely delicious! !!."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place another shot . Worst mistake ever !! I had the chole Batura and dahi puri . I ended up having stomach ache and nausea . Avoid this place at all cost !! Don't understand what part of hygiene these ppl do not understand !!"}
{"text":"My #1 Indian \"street food\" place. Very fresh ingredients and delicious curries. My favorite is their paneer kati roll which is amazing and made me fall in love with Indian food for good !!"}
{"text":"This was my favourite place to eat. But the quality has gone down in recent times. The quantity of the side dishes has also gone down. When we enquired about it, the person asked us to reduce the amount we take each serving.  The dal was watery.   The ownership needs to read these reviews and improve based on the feedback else they'll be losing a few loyal customers."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices. I love this place and have NEVER had a bad experience and they make it so convenient to try new things being their menu is so expansive for their size. Love it all!!!"}
{"text":"Having never have tried Indian food before... I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. I got a lot of food. All vegetarian. And had a little spicy kick. Overall great experience. Very surprising location inside of a grocery store. A wonderful hidden little jem would be so good."}
{"text":"Great food and super low prices. I brought my family in for a quick snack and the portions are so big that it turned into a full meal. All of us left completely full and without spending a lot. A great vegetarian place that can customise to suit your needs. I specially liked the friendliness and politeness of the staff as they took the time to understand my needs and answer my questions. You don't expect that kind of service from a counter pickup place. If you are looking for good home cooked vegetarian place that won't break the bank then this place has it all....and if it doesn't then tell the staff and they will make it happen."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian food! Great prices. Authentic masala chai! Our Indian parents loved this place. Service is average but the food and prices make up for this. Wish they didn't use styrofoam (carcinogenic containers)."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Loved the Pav Bhaji and Chola Bhatura over here. Came with my friends for shopping for home and ended up eating a lot of things. Rose milk was also very good. A must visit place for Indians to eat some ethnic Indian food."}
{"text":"Easily my new favorite restaurant. Beautiful flavors, inexpensive, and everything is vegan on the menu besides a yogurt sauce here and there. The staff is lovely and helpful. What a breath of fresh air!!"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick dinner. Nice spot inside of the Lotus Market with a great food selection and super cheap prices. The best part was that all of the items were clearly labeled as vegan or that they could be made vegan, which is always a challenge with Indian food. Everything we tried was fantastic, but the samosa chaat and behl were probably the best. I think we spent $36 total and got enough food for 4-5 people. The owner (I presume) was very friendly and showed us how to eat the pani puri, which I had certainly never tried before. Certainly not the fanciest restaurant, but the food was fantastic."}
{"text":"My wife and I needed out Indian fix so Lotus Deli was chosen. We tried the Paneer Butter Masala, Dahi Puri, and Bhatura. The Paneer Butter Masala deliciously creamy and flavorful (spicy too!). The Paneer was fresh and it went well with Roti and Bhatura we had. The Bhatura itself had a great fry and wasn't oily at all (another great sign!). Lastly, the Dahi Puri was probably my favorite, as they were filled to the brim with delicious yogurt/potatoes and a great sauce. While the Dahi Puri was very filling, it still gave you a lasting feeling of freshness when you finished.  Overall, will definitely be returning to try out some more Indian food goodness."}
{"text":"Always great food! On weekends, it gets busy and service may be slightly slow. But the taste of the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Saw the article about this place in New Times.  So glad we saved the address.  It is incredible!  So good."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT JOB LOTUS DELI! We had the Paneer Butter Masala combo & mango lassi everything was delicious! Super fresh quality & so convenient inside the market. So excited for this treat in our neighborhood"}
{"text":"I have been to over 50 Indian restaurants worldwide, from England all the way to the USA. Not one place I have been too has the taste of these samosas. Must try!"}
{"text":"Okish food. Avoidable. Have tasted better Indian food in the valley. Paneer kati wrap I liked. Else the mango Lassi vada pav pav bhaji were very ok"}
{"text":"This vegetarian deli is fantastic! It's inside the Lotus Market, so be sure to check it out. Very inexpensive, and the flavors are authentic.  They are mostly street food, and the place is divey, but it remains superlative and consistent, though if you want fine dining look elsewhere. Met my co-workers here who are both Asians, and one happened to be from north of Mumbai.  I got the Halwa, Puri & Sabji, but they made me try a few Indian dishes that they ordered. The Dahi Puri, an appetizer filled with potatoes, yogurt, and other sauces, and the Choley Kathi Wrap were yummy. The one I ordered was a traditional dish served with a vegetable curry, Indian bread, and a dessert. I didn't care for the dessert, but the spicy side dish was delicious. The service was warm and welcoming, and certainly had a 'home dining.' feel to it."}
{"text":"It's an Indian Deli where you can buy the essential groceries and while you're at it splurge into some Indian vegetarian delicacies like Choley bhatura,paav Bhaji,samosas or try the combo meals (rice,roti,dal,curry,pickle,salad).  They also have some wraps or try the chaats if you like tangy spicy food. You can finish it up with lassi or masala Chai."}
{"text":"Okayish food.  Quite pricey compared to other Indian snack joints in and around Mesa."}
{"text":"Good food! All of the foods have the traditional names, but there is an English description below each dish- just grab a menu.   We tried the chickpea curry, samosas, aloo bonda, and a potato curry. For a small establishment inside of a market, they do a great job with presentation. All of our food looked tantalizing.   My favorite was the potato curry. So much flavor. The aloo bonda was also good, but the oil that the aloo bonda/samosas were fried in tasted old. They would've been the highlight otherwise. The chickpea curry was fine, but lacked flavor. The Indian flatbreads that come with the chickpea curry were AMAZING. The potato curry came with lentil soup, roti, and white rice. Both of the appetizers came with green and red chutney (sorry, I don't know what they are traditionally called!) We left very full.   I also love that we were able to get everything vegan. :)"}
{"text":"First off, very affordable Indian food. And waiting times are like 15 mins at max. However, I do not agree with the health standards of this place. We ordered poori sabji and the sabji was down right bad and stale. The poori was like raw and half done. What baffles me how can they serve stale food to kids??! I am Indian and it puts me to shame when my fellow country folks do sub par actions like these!"}
{"text":"The deli is tucked inside of Lotus Market - a small Indian super market. There is plenty of seating, though I rarely see anyone eating there around lunch time. They have a variety of curries available along with a range of other wraps and treats. In the past I've ordered one of their wraps which came filled with a blue/green sauce that both tasted and looked like a very artificial \"mint\" chutney. This time I tried the Combo Thali, which comes with a curry of your choice, soup, jasmine rice, and bread. The flavor was just okay, but nothing like my favorite Indian eatery (Ruchi)."}
{"text":"I had the Thali Combo. All I can say is the explosion of awesome spices created a melody of goodness. The spicy pickled lemon? Let's just say try this dish and pick your favorite curry of the day and be ready to have a good time. Once or twice a month is about par for me. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The best indian food I ever ate !!! Everything can be made vegan and the quality is insane! Amazing price too! This place is our top #1 indian street food love love it"}
{"text":"So good.... Had the Paneer Kathi Wrap and Butter Masala. So very amazing. I am coming back for sure. I don't know if I can ever bring myself to order anything... Cafeteria/market ambiance."}
{"text":"I eat at Lotus Deli a few times a week for lunch. Each time I go the staff is very helpful and considerate of my vegan lifestyle. They are knowledgeable and friendly. I always feel welcome. The food is amazing. I've tried a few different dishes and the flavors are so rich. I would recommend this place to anyone, not just vegans. If you are in the area, it's tucked inside the Lotus marketplace. Definitely a hidden gem that you want to check out for an affordable and delicious vegan lunch. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic traditional Indian vegetarian food. This is authentic stuff, not Americanized. 2 of us were stuffed after eating 2 chaats and sharing a curry thali, all for under $18.   Fun to watch Indian music videos while we ate. Also fun to browse and shop the market afterwards."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the valley (and I'm Indian too). Would definitely come back for more. Prices are excellent too! The staff is pleasant and very attentive, if there is a delay in the food it's only because it is all made very fresh! I will definitely be coming back. The paneer kathi roll is on point."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! My favorite was #11 Thali. I would add fluffy bread instead of the flat. And Samosa Chaat. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"have been here over 10 times for some authentic Indian street food. Usually get House special, one plate with three items, Papadi Chat, Samosa Chat, and Allotikki Chat all very tasty. Also order Vadapaav most times, brings back memories of Mumbai!! Only reason I give them 4 star is because lately the service is been poor. Even when place is empty staff is not attentive. Food is amazing and will keep coming back and hopefully service will get better."}
{"text":"Discovered this lil gem while looking for Indian grocery in the area during lunch time. The food is on point and can taste the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Wonderful food.  Recipes are grandmas and cover both northern and southern Indian dishes.  Total shock for a tiny place inside a grocery store.  Some of the best Indian food we have fouond."}
{"text":"This little hidden gem was a spectacular find! It is tucked away inside Lotus supermarket, with hardly any signage outside. If it wasn't for Yelp, I never would have found it, but I'm glad I did. The food is fresh, flavorful, and served up fast. Plenty of vegetarian options, and they were respectful of my gluten-free request. Excellent value and taste for the price! The lunch combo was just the right size, and didn't leave me feeling hungry. I will definitely come back to try some other dishes!"}
