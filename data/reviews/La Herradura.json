{"text":"Love this place! 

Mari the owner did a wonderful job, employees are great and very nice not to mention very professional. 

The tacos are the bomb"}
{"text":"The score would be higher if it were not for El Paraiso but I just can't help compare the two as they are both similar.
The tacos were a little more money and a little less tasty. The beef taco was mostly fat and the campechano was a little dry. 
I did like the cheese dip and the horchata a little more than paraiso but not enough to make me want to hurry back.
I do like the fact that they have a more extensive menu and the service was quick and friendly. 
I think I would try it again and get something different. Maybe for dinner this time."}
{"text":"Food is good and excellent service! They also cater to the fact I don't eat
Meat and are willing to transform any dish to vegetarian."}
{"text":"WARNING: This restaurant serves Hispanics only

After waiting 10 minutes to be seated (with no one else  ahead of us) and despite many glances by the waitstaff, my family and I sat ourselves.

10 minutes after that of being Ignored, we attempted to flag down one of their waitresses, both of whom made it very obvious they were not going to respond. Looking at us dead in the eye, they just outright ignored us. 

Looking around the room and seeing that we were the only whites in there, it became obvious why. 

I HIGHLY recommend that unless you are Hispanic, to steer clear of this place. Even if you do get served, I wouldn't trust the food they would serve you."}
{"text":"Free cheese dip and large portions offer a great value here.  I had the pollo fundido and my tortillas were nice and hot.  Place doesnt look like much from the road, but the inside is very clean.  Service was good.  Soda selection is limited (no diet coke).  We will definitely return as the entrees are about $2-3 less than Mex places along US-74."}
