{"text":"I got the Kung Pao Chicken Rice Bowl. The burst of flavor from this dish was spectacular! I loved the spicy pepper thing and the topping it off with shriracha sauce.  One thing I didn't enjoy as much was the meat. I didn't like it as much cause it was boiled and I this dish made me think more along the lines of fried. I think most kung pao chickens are boiled tho... Hey it was definitely healthier and did taste pretty good! The bowl was also only 6.75. I was recommended the boiled dumplings but wasn't in the mood for it this time... maybe next time!"}
{"text":"For a CMU dining establishment, I'd say this place is above average. It keeps me coming back when I don't have time to go off campus. My go tos are usually the soul ramen (especially with lots of Sriracha haha) and their curry."}
{"text":"This is a food truck on the CMU campus where there are many.  Has quick service and passable food, but I would make the walk to other trucks with better options.  Not my favorite."}
{"text":"Tbh, don't really know why this place exists. It's really poorly placed, and the food served here is just microwavable mush. The rice is ok I guess, but I mean. It's rice. What more do you expect out of an essential. As for the food, it's usually too saucy and messy. Everything is essentially a curry, probably because all the food they have is frozen.   If you want to save some money and have 5 minutes to spare for walking, just walk to the Margaret Morrison Food trucks, which are much better."}
{"text":"Food was not entirely inedible. I ordered their Soul ramen noodle with chicken. The broth was murky, and salty. Had 1/2 of egg, 1 small portabella mushroom, corn, scallions.  Also I ordered an eggroll. Which was skinny, mushy inside, bland no flavor. I had hear from friends of mine that  CMU was coming out with a food truck. I was excited to try something new. Traveling over there during lunch hour. The service was quick.  Cost was fair. Food isn't something to keep coming back for. Was OK, if it's the only Asian food around and you want to save a few dollars. Go for it. I gave it 2 stars cause, well, I did finish the food. I just wasn't impressed. The cashiers and employees looked really annoyed to even be there. As if they were working in an assembly line."}
