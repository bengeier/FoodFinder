{"text":"Tonight is opening night for the restaurant and I am pleased to say that the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, the ambiance excellent 'mod' without being overpowering and the gnocchi was beautifully presented and delicious with multiple layers of flavor from the gnocchi to the squash squares to the shavings of Parmesan to the pesto sauce."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of eating at 4 sister's last night and it was by far the best restaurant we have ever eaten at and that includes Paris. We started our meal with mussels in a wine sauce, scallops and the Fall Harvest, which was outstanding. One member of the party had the braised beef risotto and the other the gnocchi, both meals were unbelievable! Each had unique and flavorful tastings and subtle flavors not often found at restaurants. Desserts included creme brulee and a flourless chocolate cake, which was more like a French macaroon- light and fluffly, not the usual dark chocolate and heavy flourless cake. All in all, an incredible experience and one you should not miss if in the Madison area! Kudos to the chef!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing! Excellent tapas, extensive wine list and exemplary service. I recommend the duck confit and the Manchego Brûlée."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and service.  Met a few friends here for drinks and appetizers.  We sat at the bar and had outstanding service.  Bartender was very attentive and professional.  We started with oysters and they were excellent.  Very fresh and the mignonette was incredible.  We then had the prawns, tuna tartar, carpaccio, scallops, crab cake and risotto.  The tuna and carpaccio were total standouts.  Perfectly seasoned and flavored.  The scallops, prawns and risotto were also good but the crab cake was unanimously the least favorite.  Will definitely be back to try the entrees.  Great to have such a fun new place this side of Madison."}
{"text":"Happy to see this great addition to Verona. We made a reservation for a Saturday night and definitely did NOT need it, which I hope doesn't stay the norm. We went out with friends anticipating a fun night out with a few cocktails and shared plates. Despite the restaurant being empty, we all felt pretty rushed by our server to order and move on, so I hope they get better at matching the service with the style of the restaurant.  The cocktail menu was just ok and the salty dog was downright bad. Nothing stood out there and I'd just stick to wine for sure next time.  We shared the prosciutto wrapped shrimp (really good), the manchego creme brûlée (sweet and creamy), and the cheese board with friends. Hard to make a cheese board unique but they did (lemon curd was awesome). I had the braised short rib risotto which was very rich but nicely done. Hubs had the duck special with polenta and blueberry chutney.  Looking forward to my return."}
{"text":"With several wine based establishments already in Verona, one would think that another would be a bit of overkill but get ready to be awash in fermented grape juice my friends! Another one has just hit the market and it is going to fit in just fine! I was lucky enough to be invited to the 'soft opening' of 4 Sisters Tapas Restaurant several nights ago and it was an overwhelming hit!! Attending with several friends, each of us ordered something different so we could try as many things on the not too sparse, not too extensive, but just right menu as possible. With both tapas and large plates to choose from, we set ourselves up for a worthy task. My definite favorite was the Seafood Paella. With mussels, clams, shrimp, 'seasonal fish', and saffron infused rice, it was delicioso! The clams were especially prominent with a buttery, salty, seasoned flavor that made me want to hoard all of them! It is on the large plate menu and believe me, the paella is a large portion! Everyone else at the table liked it too. There are two other versions, one that has chorizo and one with chicken and Andouille sausage. The other dish I was high on was the ceviche'. Made with scallop, shrimp, and crab, it was a bright, crisp citrus flavor that put sunshine on my tongue and was not overpowered by any of the other add ins, with just the right amount of heat (for me). Those of you who've read my reviews know that the range on my Scoville scale is fairly low, as I see no reason to have my tongue melted and lips fall off because a chef put a bucketful of capsaicin in the dish to hide the flavor. Definitely not the case with any of the dishes on this menu! Other dishes of note that we tried were: prosciutto wrapped shrimp (which were more like prawns!) with a poblano cream; pesto scallops made with a cilantro pesto, charred corn salsa, and chipotle cream; Portobello Napolean, that both vegetarians and carnivores alike will go nuts over (pardon the pun) being encrusted in pine nuts, spinach cream, fresh mozzarella, and drizzled with 18-year raspberry balsamic glaze (amaze-balls!!); Salmon (that was done perfectly) and served with limoncello beurre noisette, tomato chutney, and sitting on 'forbidden black rice'; and finally the overall table favorite, the Manchego Brulee. It was outstanding and a dessert in and of itself! The dish is manchego custard, house cured juniper pancetta, with a brown sugar glaze and served with sliced baguette toast coins, and it put our taste buds in nirvana! This seemed more like a dessert than a dinner dish! When we ran out of toast, we just ate it with our spoons! Be warned, order this with a group, unless you and your date are willing to succumb to a gastronomical coma (or get a to go bucket) as it comes in a good sized ramekin boat. It is a definite must to order however....magnifico! Speaking of dessert! We tried the flourless chocolate cake, the crème brulee, and the cheesecake. The chocolate cake was so light and airy it seemed as though they made it with meringue and then baked it! The cheesecake was also very light, not the dense filling kind that we've all wished we'd skipped after a hearty meal, and the crème brulee was browned to perfection. Both of these were served with a fruit drizzle and fresh raspberries. As I mentioned at the start, this is a wine establishment too and you oenophiles will not be disappointed. The house wines are good, and cover the whole spectrum, (merlot, pinot noir, cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, pinot grigio) but the wine list is extensive, with a decent amount of wines available by the glass. If you, or one of your party is not a wine drinker though, fear not! They have a full bar with seasoned mixologists who can whip up a traditional WI Brandy Old Fashion just as easily as pouring a beer from the craft beer selection. No matter what your poison, you'll find something that will complement the dish you order. You'll know you're in a wine establishment, with the 'wall of wine' greeting you, the moment you walk in. The bar area is inviting with a very cool, curved bar and plenty of tables for small or large crowds. We retired to the very fashionable, and comfy, pit group to have one more glass of wine before calling it a night and got to meet Chef Jake. I didn't get a chance to discuss his background, or culinary pedigree, but based on what we tasted, he's definitely got game! I'm very much looking forward to visiting again and trying some of the many other dishes and wines on the menu........before you all find out about this place! In vino veritas!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the restaurant. The seafood paella was so-so, I felt like it was missing something, but the chorizo mussels and the duck confit were excellent. I also love the small plates concept. I definitely will be returning to try some more of the menu options"}
{"text":"What a great find! I'm a tapas fan and this place was Mecca. I had the duck confit and the tenderloin skewers with a wonderful asparagus soup and was in heaven. Best of all the special was order 2 tapas plates and get a free glass of wine."}
{"text":"Every time, my wife and I planned to visit this place, something had happened.    Finally, we were there last Thursday.  The restaurant is very clean and quite not crowded.    Following its name, we ordered TAPAS plates and had beers the bartender recommended.  This was our first time to try TAPAS since we watched Spanish TAPAS tv show program a few months ago.  The food was beautifully plated and delicious...  Since we were there at happy hour, we had sea food sampler first, and then mussels...  and Risotto...  Why Risotto?  My wife wanted Risotto.  No further explanation necessary  My wife grew up in sea shore so very picky on Seafood freshness, but those we had were absolutely great.  Finally Risotto was good too.  Will visit again shortly.  PS: Service was great too"}
{"text":"Ate here last night. Location is nice as there are about four other restaurants there and all are by the New Hyatt. (So plenty of parking) The interior was modern and attractive enough for a very nice date night.   Three of us ordered: Spinach Spaetzle, Ahi Tuna Sashimi, Duck Confit, Pork Belly, Crab Oscar, Bay Scallops and Rarebit. All agreed that the Pork belly and Bay Scallops were best. I did not care for the Ahi Tuna Sashimi but my wife did and she likes raw fish a lot more than me so...  I had a glass of Sangria which can garnished with fruit and was served over ice. Very tasty! This place specializes in wine so it made sense that they can make a good wined based drink. (I am not a big wine person...but if you are this place might earn another star for you as their selection seemed impressive to me.)  Bill for all that was $111 with tip. I felt it reasonably priced considering how much we ate."}
{"text":"Exceeded our expectations. We went out to Verona Woods for a bite and the only electric car spot was in front of 4 Sisters. We had a brief chat with the warm, witty, hostess and decided to to pop in for a drink after. We are so happy we did. The bartender, Josh, was beyond pro. I asked for a cocktail that I thought he would think was odd (ok funny) and he named three comparable liqueurs, let us taste them and then suggested his personal favorite cocktail made from one of the three. It was one of the best drinks I've ever had. Greats hosts and great drinks. Great combination. Thank goodness for this place. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Was my first time and we really enjoyed everything we had. For starters we shared the cheese and meat board, the crab stack and the butter poached shrimp. The crab was very fresh and delicious and the shrimp cooked perfectly. The cheese board was a great local selection that was well thought out.   For dinner I had the duck with risotto, though I had wished the duck a little more rare, it was not over cooked and super tender. The risotto was perfectly done and the addition of blueberries was nice.  The bartender was super nice and funny, very warm and welcoming environment."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and friendly service.  They have a blend of tapas and full entrees so it will make all appetites happy.   They had a wonderful home made soup!  Side salad was huge and delicious.  Great option in the Verona area!"}
{"text":"Love tapas so gave it a shot. It was okay. This place Is attempting sophistication however the decor seemed out of an Ashley furniture store. No sound buffers so quite noisy.   The service was fine.  The pricing okay.  The 4 tapas orders.  One very good ( duck) and 2 very ordinary (scallops , shrimp) and a very good (Porto Bella mushrooms ) The Creme boulaise  (sp) mushy  Will try many others before we return."}
{"text":"When you advertise yourself as a \"tapas\" restaurant and you put paella on the menu, the expectation from your customers is that you might actually have eaten paella at some time in the past.  Certainly you're putting yourself out there as a \"Spanish\" or at least \"Spanish-ish\" restaurant.  Tapas are Spanish.  Paella is Spanish.  Perhaps my expectations were too high?  But having some working knowledge of paella would seem to be in order here.  You could at least read a recipe on how to properly prepare paella.  Or maybe watched a YouTube video of paella preparation.  Maybe talked to someone who's actually travelled to Spain and eaten paella?  But none of these seemed to have occurred to the chefs at this overpriced, hipster-infused tragedy of a restaurant, 4 Sisters in Verona.    Screw it, they said, let's wing it.  Rice?  Check.  Saffron?  Check.  Frozen seafood chunks?  Check!  Let's roll!  For those of us who HAVE eaten paella in the past (even had excellent paella served here in Madison at Estrellon!), the key elements of paella are a carbon steel flat bottomed pan with two hoop handles, a wooden spoon and a distinctly crunchy almost-burned layer of rice at the bottom of the pan which you scrape up with that wooden spoon and savor.  The rice is tender-moist but not wet except for the that crunchy layer on the bottom.  The seafood is fresh and relatively dry, the sausage is thick and grilled.  Even Wikipedia knows what makes a good paella:  \"After cooking paella, there is usually a layer of toasted rice at the bottom of the pan, called socarrat in Spain. This is considered a delicacy among Spaniards and is essential to a good paella. The toasted rice develops on its own if the paella is cooked over a burner or open fire. If cooked in an oven, however, it will not. To correct this, place the paellera over a high flame while listening to the rice toast at the bottom of the pan. Once the aroma of toasted rice wafts upwards, it is removed from the heat. The paella must then sit for about five minutes (most recipes recommend the paella be covered with a tea-towel at this point) to absorb the remaining broth.\"  What emerged from the dank, incompetent kitchen of 4 Sisters was a bowl (not a pan, but a bowl!) of soggy yellow rice with a few thin slices of andoille sausage, pieces(!) of scallops, a couple of shrimp, half-a-dozen mussels and a couple of clams.  It was not, in any way, even reminiscent of what the Spanish regard as paella.  It was, in a word, vile.  This soggy, dreary, pathetic excuse for paella rang in at $27.  One can only hope this restaurant closes soon and is replaced by another much-needed Starbucks (can you have too many?).  The space occupied by 4 Sisters would be better served by nearly ANYTHING ELSE moving in and displacing this wretched excuse of a restaurant."}
{"text":"I had the seafood paella. It was awesome! If you like paella, you'll love it. Our waitress (Taylor) was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"WE LOVE THIS PLACE!! We stumbled across them in LaCrosse and were thrilled when they opened a second location much closer to home. The menu is excellent and the food is very very good. So what's with the bitc*y 3 stars??  Our party of 4 approached the $200 mark, which is pretty lofty territory. We were celebrating and ate well, so the number isn't outrageous, but you won't overlook it. At this level of investment we really hope for great service and unfortunately we didn't get it.   The food came slowly on what seemed to be a quiet night. Our server was quite disconnected- drinks took a long time, return visits were sporadic and she seemed to be struggling to keep up.   I would highly recommend that the fine Sisters pay close attention to their table service and possibly invest in another server or two- the quality of the food deserves it and guests will demand it."}
{"text":"Wow, I wasn't expecting that to be so awesome.  Coming off of a vacation where all the food was mediocre at best, it was nice to ditch the kids and get an amazing meal with my wife.  I'm not a big fan of tapas restaurants, but we wanted to give this place a try.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could.  We got the spinach, crab, artichoke dip which was probably the best I've ever had.  My wife got the scallops, and said they were the best she has found in Wisconsin.  I had the pork tacos, which were delicious.  Not a single complaint about any of those items.    They had a good mix of cocktails and I got a mule which was pretty good, not as amazing as the food, but then again I did order a second one.    My biggest concern is the place was dead at 6:30 on a Saturday night.  I hope people give this place a try, so they stay in business, because it has truly amazing food.  We'll likely be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Found 4 sisters and went in for a late dinner. Service was good. Food was fabulous-it was lovely. We will be back again."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! A must stop if ever in Verona! I've enjoyed their mushroom soup to scallop pasta and crab stack and all have been great! I look forward to eating here again whenever I return to Verona!"}
