{"text":"(I would have posted this years ago but wasnt yelp or review knowlegable at all!) We took our family of 6 (2 adults, 4 children) here years ago as it was a casual place that had reasonable prices and with 4 kids to feed we needed reasonable and comfortable. We stopped going to this restaurant when my son then 10 years old was eating a pasta dish and tapped me on the arm and pointed to his plate and said whats this? I looked down and to my horror there was a curly bit of a pot scrubber in his food! I am talking a piece that looks like a spring, is an inch long and metal! HOW could they NOT SEE IT!? Thank goodness my son was old enough to watch what he was eating, and not be messing around not paying attention and he didnt eat it and possibly choke to death on it, etc.!!  I called over a waitress to show her, she said oh we are sorry, then walks away! I thought ok maybe she is going to tell the manager or something but nope, she continued to serve people then sat at the counter for a break. So we packed our kids up paid the bill yes we still paid the bill and when asked at the register about our dinners we spoke to the cashier there about what happened, so 2 people said \"oh we are sorry that happened, and not another word) ( they never offered to waive the cost of his or any of our meals, nor did they actually offer to replace his meal with a fresh one, he was supposed to eat one that had been contaminated with possibly more smaller pieces of metal because he was a child!? NONE of our meals were touched after we saw that in his food, we got up and left me commenting loud enough to hubby about the metal in our sons food that other diners hopefully checked thier food). We took our kids to another restaurant to eat,(though I wanted to go home and cook after that, but I was outvoted lol). Also once before this incident when our drinks were brought to our table a couple of the glasses had fruit flys, small bugs in them. Not just 1 glass but a couple, we told the waitress and she got new drinks but they were very visable in a clear pop so they should have been seen and not served at all, so we were VERY careful to check the refilled drinks.  We have not been there since our children were younger because of the actual danger our son was put in, sure the fruit flys in the glasses wasnt great, but that was something that made us stop going to the place for a short just because of the ick factor,  but the pot scrubber metal that could have killed one of our children and the way that the waitress just sort of brushed it off totally did it and we have not gone back ever again! Our kids are all adults now (the baby is 19) most with children of thier own, but when driving by the place or the place is mentioned, it is always about how you get metal served with your meal to try to kill you! And to this day my son pays such close attention to restaurant food and is very nervous to eat out because of that scare. He was old enough to remember what happwned and realise that he could have choked on that metal and possibly died!  This review is in hopes that anyone that eats there pays close attention to thier childs meal, or doesnt take the chance at all.  I would honestly hate to hear a child was hurt just going out to a restaurant with his/her family to eat!"}

{"text":"Diner type place with decent food, great homemade soup, plentiful salad bar, nice sizes portions and friendly servers. I had the country Fried stead with mashed potatoes and corn, it was awesome. My boyfriend had meatloaf mashed potatoes and peas and it was equally good. There was various puddings on the salad bar for dessert but there was no way I could do it...I was stuffed.  Stopped in for another visit on a Sunday for lunch. I was really disappointed. I ordered breaded pork chops and got grilled pork chops that were tough and had no flavor."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped there this morning for breakfast after church.  My wife had  one egg scrambled with American cheese, bacon, and hash browns and apple sauce, while I had two eggs over easy, with bacon and rye toast.  We both had coffee.  The orders came out quickly.  My wife's order was prepared very well.  My order was prepared well with the exception of the rye toast.  The rye was sliced very thin, which would have been ok, except that the bread was stale, so it tasted like Melba toast, Which is not what I was looking for to sop up the egg yolk.   We have been here many times before, and have had many a well prepared  breakfast, so I was disappointed to say the least. Our waitress provided very good service and attended to our needs."}
{"text":"Homed fries with onions were yummy and customer service great. We chose to eat here instead of Bob Evans because I like to support family businesses."}
{"text":"We went there because we had a coupon offering $5 off two meals.  We bought the meals as required.  The food was good and the prices were acceptable but when we went to pay we were told that you had to buy two drinks to get the $5 off.  We carefully inspected the coupon and found not such restriction.  The hostess would not relent saying she had gotten in trouble too often for allowing the discount.    Won't be back."}
{"text":"Super friendly people, but the food is always something I have to complain about.. warm pudding, warm pasta salad, cheap quality sandwich meat.. Good prices, but I usually choose elsewhere. I miss FF."}
{"text":"Visited my sister's place for the weekend, she often visit this restaurant so my family followed. There was 8 of us and ordered various meals off the menu and visited the salad bar. Salad bar was a-ok, nothing wow about it. Just basic salad bar. The soup was overcooked, pasta came apart as the soup was kept warming on the salad bar. All meals were a-ok but the place needs a major overhaul. You get what you pay for...."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times. We followed our waitress here from Jimmy's. (Heather) The food is reasonably priced and being a breakfast hound that I am I'm happy with the size and taste of the pancakes.  Been here numerous times. We followed our waitress here from Jimmy's. The food is reasonably priced and being a breakfast hound that I am I'm happy with the size and taste of the pancakes.  The down side of  today's experience was not the food, employees or the location itself.   It was the clientele. There were at least 3 groups sitting around us that had their cell phones going off constantly and they never bothered to answer. Couldn't even be bothered to put their phone on silent. The other issue were the group sitting on the complete opposite side of the restaurant. Two women brought in their children. Normally not an issue. However these women did nothing to settle the children down from yelling \"Hello\" to anyone who walked by. They also kept screaming at the top of their lungs they want crackers. The icing on the cake was when a police officer sitting next to us was leaving (He was a Major by the way) the children and I quote yelled. \"Look mom there's a Po-po!\"  Sadly the women in charge of these children never even attempted to settle them down, sit them down or even apologize to people around them.   Its time like that make me wish all places still had signs that read. \"We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.\"  Other than the annoyances stated above Favored Flavor continues to be a solid place to eat."}
{"text":"The breakfast and lunch specials are very reasonably priced. The salad bar is lacking. The soup is salty. The majority of the food is low quality.  I ordered a turkey Ruben and I wouldn't have fed the turkey to my dog, over processed dreck!  The place doesn't look overly clean and if your under forty, you will be a minority.  The servers are your stereo typical diner type servers, most on the northern side of forty, but all more than competent as well as friendly.  The menu is large as well as varied, but just like a Yugo, regardless of  how many accessories, its still a Yugo! This is the perfect example of, \"you get what you pay for\"."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food,  and good people. We especially like their waffles and sausage gravy."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast at Family Restaurant. Ask the price before you order. Prices have been jacked up but menu prices remain the same. False advertising. Shame on them."}
{"text":"we would of given no stars if we could. we came there on Tuesday July 26 2016 with family of 9 .. the service was terrible the waitress was very rude and un professional. all of us hated the food it was terrible. my aunt ordered fish and it was so horrible smell that we knew it was old fish they were selling we asked waitress to take it back she did how ever they still charged us for the full meal even tho the fish was in edible and all my aunt was able to eat was a mediocre soup that came with her meal .. the server never expressed any solution .. then another server carrying dirty cups and glasses from clearing a table came by us and spilled one of the dirty cups of coffee on my sisters back and she knew she did because she said \"oh!!! I am sorry\" neither our sever or the girl who spilled it came back to help clean up as my sister was drenched in old coffee all over her back... this place is a joke I do not recommend anyone coming here and in fact this place should not even be in business .. the worst service and rudeness all of us received ever at a restaurant ...terrible..stay far far away from this dump"}
{"text":"Typical proud mom and pop restaurant. Not fancy. Clean, good service, fresh salad bar, homemade soups, and a decent menu of choices. First thing we think about when we think \"Family Restaurant\" are the soups. Often 4 different selections.  For ~$8  dollars each including drinks, you'll get the Soup &Salad, one of about  dozen sandwich choices. You will not leave hungrey.  Long time prior restaurant business name was \"Favored Flavor\", popular with the locals."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and was highly disappointed. I ordered grilled pork chops and I didn't think it was possible for a chop to be thinner or more tasteless. Your experience here is greatly dependent on what you order here."}
