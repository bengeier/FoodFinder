{"text":"This place has really gone downhill. I just went there the other day for the first time in about a year. The biggest reason for going there was for the \"chipsters\". These homemade fries/potato chips used to be delicious. When I gave the waitress my order she told me they no longer had them (even though they were still on the menu). When I showed my disappointment, she gave me some attitude. Instead of the \"chipsters\" I ordered some regular fries and wings. The fries were ok but the wings were horrible. Imagine melting a stick of butter and adding a tablespoon of hot sauce for the flavoring. On top of that, they were way undercooked.   Needless to say, I was very disappointed in my meal and will not be going back. I am also upset because I have recommended Cole's to several friends. This will never happen again."}
{"text":"Great food beer and service. Get the stuffed hot pepper sandwich.  Rare beer selection."}
{"text":"Started off and ended with wonderful service by Trish! Homemade food was delicious and beer selection was fabulous for such a small joint. The place was clean, every staff member was friendly and fun! Thanks for the great service!   As an unknown plus, they also do a 10% military discount- they did ours automatically and was much appreciated :) we will be back!"}
{"text":"Went with some work friends to this spot. Great small pub atmosphere, and a large pumpkin beer selection. I had the fish it was large and delicious. Prices were fair and people were nice."}
{"text":"Food is way too expensive.  Service is good, for a bar.  Food was cooked well.  Guess the door in the men's bathroom couldn't get fixed, so if you have to poop, go somewhere else.  Got walked in on twice.  If I could give no stars just for that alone, I would. Bar floor looks like dirty mop water got swirled around about 10 times as well. Oh, and whoever runs the establishment need to work on the lighting. Almost fell walking from the restaurant to the bar."}
{"text":"Went out with a friend for one or five beers and found this place one Yelp ... 1. It was close to home, 2. They had good beers on tap, and 3. We've never been. This was a Wednesday (Hump Day as I have recently found it the day is also called, thanks to some Camel ... Mike, Mike, Mike!) so the place wasn't too packed. Penguins were playing and some baseball game with Royals and Mets or somebody ...  Found out it was Taco Wednesday ... it is Wing Tuesdays at this joint. Tacos were 2 bucks a piece and not too big. I ate three and needed more so I got some wings. I honestly believe the tacos should be a buck a piece. The beers were good and they had a good selection. Had a good fall beer from Anderson Valley and a black IPA from Southern Tier, also tasty. I had read on some reviews something about smoke inside, which I didn't witness. Maybe it being a Wednesday and not a weekend makes a difference. I saw all smokers go outside though.  All in all this is a good place to go for a good beer, and it is close enough to home that walking could be an option, though long enough that I would be sober by the time I got home! Second thought .. it is close enough to get the wife to drive over and get my drunk behind!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing chicken salads! Have been going there for 10+ years and never left disappointed, although the place should do some updating and maybe be a little more clean. But good is amazing!"}
{"text":"Although I live in Ohio a few times every month I meet friends at Cole's for their fried fish sandwiches. In our collective opinion it is the best we have found anywhere.  We usually sit in the lower seating area where Marion knows what we are going to order - she never even has to write it down. Great service and quality every time."}
{"text":"Coles pub is the best restaurant in imperial! They always have the best selection of beers on tap. My personal favorite thing to order is the Chicken Cheddar salad with ranch. Literally try it you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"WORST LUNCH SERVICE EVER...  The food took way to long to come out. Others who sat down afterwards were served ate and finished before we got our lunch. The food was good, no complaints about taste or portions but the waitress who was also bar tending for a maximum occupancy of 8ppl was extremely un attentive to the presence of us in the dining room. Never checked in to see how we were doing on drinks or to ask if we needed anything. Had to go up to the bar to receive a drink that she forgot to bring us, and also had to ask for our check. oh ya! We had an 11 month baby with us.   So hopefully your visit is better than ours!"}
{"text":"We came for the Fish sandwich and left very happy. I was very impressed with the service and the quality. We both got the fish and an order of fried zucchini. The zucchini came out right after our fish, but they made up for it by sitting down a HUGE plate of crispy friend heaven. I will definitely go back and try the wing and the other food on the menu! They had a great beer list also for anyone looking for a fresh ipa!"}
{"text":"My mum and her friends love Cole's. They go probably once a week. We went the weekend before Christmas and my mom stated it was much busier than usual on the restaurant side. Our waitress was a little frazzled, but she was also the only one out there to help everyone. (They did have someone from the bar running out food and grabbing drinks when he could.) It's the type of place where, if you go often, they'll remember you. The waitress was chatting with our friend's 3 year old about Christmas coming.  Beer selection was very broad. I had a delicious chocolate peanut butter stout. Their food is that type of delicious bar food that you feel slightly guilty about eating, but secretly you want to have it every day of your life."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and have never been disappointed. Everything I've had to eat has been at least very good. My favorites are the burger with bite and fish sandwiches, but the roast beef and meatloaf are awesome too. They also have a pretty good draft list."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Coles Pub for the first time.  Coles is about five miles from my house.  Coles had a nice large bar that was fairly full on a Friday Happy Hour.  The owner came over because I sat at a bar table and she didn't have a waitress yet.  She sent a waitress over from the dining room.  Waitress was very friendly. Plenty of craft beers on tap.  My wife got the wings.  One order comes in groups of 8.  I had one of her wings and they were done to perfection.  I had the meatball hoagie which was considered a Coles speciality.  Meatballs were very good!  Wish there would have been a few more fries.  This is a nice hidden gem in Imperial.  I would definitely return.  place had nice character."}
{"text":"Searched on Yelp for a place for lunch after our visit to Janoski's Farm Market. Found this awesome pub. Great food and service. Hot roast beef sandwich, fresh cut fries all with Mancini bread. Friendly people, non smoking. Looks like a great place to watch the Steeler games. Thank you Kelly Cole, owner and Marian, our server. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly place with absolutely terrific menu items. You get man sized meals for very fair prices. Drafts are kids pricy but the food and atmosphere far outweigh the price of brew."}
{"text":"What a fun place! The beer selection here is unparalleled to any other establishment in the area. Several local craft brews and several different types of beer. The newly renovated bar area has increased bar front space, and there is new tv's to watch the games. The homemade food is also very good.   I very much recommend this bar. Coles Pub is not the typical dive bar in the local area, rather it's become a great establishment to enjoy a cold tasteful beer and grab a nice bite to eat. It is the best pub in the West Allegheny area by far.  The smoke-free aspect is also a good touch!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall pub.  Full of characters and friendly locals.  I needed to fill up prior to jumping on an airplane, and this place fit the bill perfectly!  I tried the Jalapeno Burger.  It was a monster, dripping with juices.    Lots of beers on draft and a friendly staff make this place a feel good pit stop.  I think I'll make it a regular stop when I fly into Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"This is the best local pub!  Food is always great and reasonably priced... The meatball appetizer is tremendous! Kelly also makes amazing soup.   Yum!!     Beer selection is great, with plenty of craft brews on tap. Bartenders are really attentive and friendly.    Give it a try... You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Bartender Amy is on top of it! She consistently and efficiently delivers good food and drink with flair.  Whether a regular or not, Amy and the owner Bill make everyone feel welcome."}
{"text":"Great place for an afternoon lunch. Stopped  in after a hike and was met by a very clean pub with great service. The food was surprisingly great. I expected normal bar food, and the menu didnt suggest otherwise, but this little place needs to be featured on one of those TV shows that pop into these types of joints. Solid place and a must-stop for the area."}
{"text":"1st time good food good service very attentive will be back soon steak sandwich fish sandwich pizza all delicious must stop if in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"...every time I go in here the pissy bar maid leaves an empty inch at the top of my draft beer."}
{"text":"My hubby and I ate here on the recommendation of a coworker and it's a great little pub. We ordered the Reuben and the beef au-jus. The cole slaw was very good! The sandwiches are both excellent as well. What really sets everything apart is the sauces and condiments as well as the stellar service!!! Highly recommend this for good food/cold beer and great service!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good but beer is waaaayyyy overpriced. All crafts are $7 which is too much for what they serve. Id stick to the specials if I came again."}
{"text":"Great place for select seasonal craft beers. Food is always good and daily specials never disappoint. Close enough to Robinson town center to swing by after shopping to get away from the mall crowd and enjoy a quick bite. The staff is very attentive and Pittsburgh sports fans can count on the big screens tuned into the game."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go and have a few drinks or a great meal. Their food is some of the best around. The fish sandwich is the best in the area. The beer selection is also always on point, from your standard domestics to new and seasonal crafts."}
{"text":"I've been in Cole's I don't know how many times for lunch, and never left dissatisfied. Good food with generous portions, nice selections on the menu and daily specials, and the waitstaff always did a solid job. Very reasonable prices. Great place to stop!"}
{"text":"Deleted an earlier review because of several messages that I received from other Yelpers and decided to revisit Coles Pub with an open mind. Unfortunately I was again faced with having to deal with poor bar service and high pricing of their craft beers. Had the bartender been more pleasant, and competent, I would have ordered food. But being as it was a struggle just to order two beers, I passed on the food."}
{"text":"An absolute gem! Great food. Great service. Great atmosphere (non-smoking).   Best menu items: Stuffed peppers Meatballs Fisherman's sub Breasted chicken (my all-time favorite!!!)"}
{"text":"WOW! Best homemade food I've consumed in a very long time. Don't let the outside drive you away, the service was great and the food was better."}
{"text":"Very large portion for the salad that I got. Ordered chicken salad which featured grilled chicken mushrooms french fries cheese and greens. Tasty- but way too many mushrooms and not enough other vegetables. Hole in the wall place - nothing else near it and very cheap."}
{"text":"Pretty good fried chicken. You can eat at the bar or get a table. Have tried other menu items which were OK. Pace of service is uneven at times."}
{"text":"Cole's pub is off the beaten track.  If you are looking for good bar food this place is worth checking out.  The sign isn't all that pronounced so the passengers in the car were on the look out.  The outside is not much to look at, but there is ample parking.  At the entrance the bar fills the main area and there are some tables in two places.  It was an encouraging sign that there were diners as well as bar patrons.    We had heard about the fish sandwiches so three of us ordered the deep fried fish.  The Mente offer three sizes of fish sandwich. Mini, small and large.  The large was HUGE.  Big enough for two to enjoy and some for take home.  The Small sandwich was reasonably big.  Like Goldilocks the small may be just right but that will wait for the next visit.  The sandwich comes with a generous portion of tasty coleslaw and French fries.  The fries were not cooked enough.  Another in our party got the meatball appetizer.  Three racquet ball sized meatballs in sauce that were said to be melt in your mouth flavorful.    The chalkboard had some home made specials listed.  Many of the bar patrons ordered food, which is a good sign.  Big portions, good food."}
{"text":"Coles is  Family Owned Business for 25+ years. Coles is known for Great Homemade Food Prepared Fresh. Nobody Compares To The Hand Breaded Daily Giant Fish Sandwich With Fresh Cut Fries & Homemade Cole Slaw. The Small Is Large! Excellent Grilled Chicken Cheddar Or Steak Salads! Great selection of Craft Beers & Adult Beverages. Coles Runs Daily Specials, Sport Specials On Our Pens, Steelers & Pirates Game Days. Great Place To Watch The Game Or Just Stop In With Your Friends After Work. Been Coming To Coles Since The 90's!! EXCELLENT!! STOP IN!"}
