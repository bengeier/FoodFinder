{"text":"This was my second time here, the service was dismal both times. We went in for the appealing happy hour, however we were not even offered a menu. 

Crystal the bartender appears to me miserable with her job. From a business prospective it doesn't make too much sense not to refill Customer's glasses. Putters management should be embarrassed by the service offered at their establishment. The DMV offers quicker, more friendly service.  

After having an empty beer glass for 20 minutes I decided that it was time to cash out go to a bar that appreciates having Customers"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst local bar. Staff is rude, non attentive and they favor their regular high paying gamblers over huge groups of customers with money just as good."}
{"text":"Great local place that's big but feels comfortable. Awesome bartenders and the drinks are well made and reasonably priced. Haven't tried the food but will soon. Definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Service is okay, inconsistent though. Not crowded at all during the mornings so it's a great alternative to the weekend crowd at IHOP. Got the club sandwich with fries for $8. It was huge, brought home half. It was good. 

In 2009, I tried the fried panko jack cheese. Never, again.  It made me and my guest sick... bathroom sick."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this bar for over 2 years now. There are a couple main reasons I love it. First and foremost, Kyle. He is by far the BEST bartender I have ever met. He makes each visit fun, and exciting.  It's a chill place to relax with many familiar and friendly faces. 

Gavin is also great, I usually avoid the evenings when they are not present, at least when it comes to good service. 

Food? I love it. Typical bar food items to choose from, but it's all really good. Pizza is amazing too, try the Greek Pizza!

The trouble I have with Putters is...I try and stop in for  a drink or two and end up staying, and calling a cab! Kyle likes to make different drink creations that are to die for. And if you are a fan of bloody mary's?? You MUST try Kyle's. Delish! 

I'm almost embarrassed to admit, but when I made a decision to move back in Nov, I chose my location in part, large part, due to this bar. :) 

So yeah, I like it. Stop in, give it a try. I recommend Tue, Wed, or Thurs nights ;)"}
{"text":"I used to love this place till they changed the kitchen over. The new food is nowhere near as good as what they used to serve. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great service best clam chowder all you can eat specials . 5 buck beer and cheeseburger special. Big salads . Wouldnt order the pizza tastes like ketchup. This is a good place to go on the cheap and still get better than decent food"}
{"text":"Nice people but WAY too loud for a neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"I'm not a big video poker tavern guy -- so the bar side of things is left out of this review. I do like coming here for a quick, inexpensive breakfast. Service is friendly and accurate. The food is cooked correctly, though sometimes it takes a little while. I've usually arrived in the mid-to-late morning and been served immediately. For food alone, expect to pay $8-$10 a person for breakfast."}
{"text":"This bar is perfect is just want to relax, have a few drinks and gamble with a cool bartender.  Brian is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Service is always good great salads clam chowder and burger specials fun place!"}
{"text":"Came here during happy hour for our first time. Ashley the server/bartender was super awesome, greeting us and making us feel welcome.  If you have the chance,  place an order for the california flat bread  (so delish!) Or the turkey melt with some of their lemon garlic aioli added to it! I think this will be one of our new favorite watering holes."}
{"text":"$6.50 For A Stella? SMH..  If you come between the hours of 6-10PM they double the price WTF"}
{"text":"If you like piss food and piss slots come here you'll love it!!! I'd rather eat mcdonalds than the slime than serve here. Worst slots I've seen and I've been in Vegas a long time. I'd burn hundred dollar bills before I spend one of them here."}
{"text":"We went to this Putters with the children last nite.  It was not very busy so we did not have high hopes for good food but decided to go ahead and try it.  We were pleasantly surprised.  The service was good and the food chef Mike made for us was delicious.  Everyone had something different from sandwiches to pizza and salads.  It was so good and everyone loved their food.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Dive bar with a very rude bartender. I asked him to turn up the music a little, and in jest I said what do I have to do buy a round for everyone to get it louder? I went back to shooting pool, add the music remained the same. When I went to settle up he had charged me for four shots. He charged me for a round of shots for his friends. Another patron informed me that after I walked away they all did a round of shots that were put on my tab. If he was going to do that he could have told me and included me at least. Besides not turning up the music, he charged me to give his friends shots when he knew I was not serious."}
{"text":"Great smartass, cute bartender who talked crap . I really like this place, its like cheers. THe food was good the drink were good and we hit a royal flush while there. I will come back again and will be bringing my hungry, thirsty friends."}
{"text":"First time at a Putter's and I enjoyed it. We went on Football Sunday where they had special breakfast offers from 9am-2pm. I had this pretty decent sized breakfast burrito and hash browns for only $4. I was pretty stoked at that price. 

The bartender was very friendly and never let the drinks run out before she got us a new one. We also asked her to put a certain game on our side because it was only us really and she did. Very accommodating.

 The place has a restaurant side away from the bar for families who like to eat with their kids and what not. They have a calendar of some pretty sweet deals each month. From what I remember the December calendar was filled with like .50 wing Mondays and other cool stuff on certain days. 

When I first pulled up it looks really shady, being next to the $1 theater and all, but once your inside I found it to be inviting. All the staff was nice, a couple of hillbillies here and there, but mostly it was football jersey wearing fans in the place that afternoon. I might have to check it out another time during the weekend evenings."}
{"text":"I don't have any qualms with most of the Putter's in town, they're just your typical local bars and they come a dime-a-dozen in Vegas. Fairly priced drinks, regular faces, greasy-but-good-when-you're-drunk food, etc..

This particular location (Trop & Pecos) is one of the more run-down Putter's, it's got a bit of a warehouse feel to it and is very poorly ventilated. The bartender was outwardly rude, stated that there was a $10 minimum on a debit charge, and warned us not to play anything too rowdy on the jukebox. He deliberately passed my friend and I to eat his food and watch TV for several minutes while we were waiting for a drink order. My group was polite, well-dressed, and, under normal circumstances, well tipping, so I'm not sure if this bartender was just having an awful shift or what. 

Either way, next time I'm in this area, I'll be merrily skipping this joint and head straight for the Pinball Hall."}
{"text":"The Durango's Putters is the best. Great food, drinks and fast, friendly, service. Nice laid back atmosphere with friendly customers. Gaming/Sports bar with restaurant. Haven't been for breakfast, but dinner and apps are consistently good and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Fair pricing, solid food and decent atmosphere. Good service also. They also play a trivia game here Monday nights"}
{"text":"This is my second time here it's a Fun spot to chill play Darts pool and shuffle board 
The bartenders are fun and energetic... Really nice and helpful"}
{"text":"This place is so sad. Never been to a Putter's before, so I walked in not knowing what to expect. But I certainly didn't expect to be the only poor soul in the 'bar'. 

No activity at lunchtime. Waitress looked so bored, I felt bad for her. Video poker machines looked as if they were purchased from The Stardust implosion sale. And overall, the place was simply dark and depressing. I don't know how else to describe it. 

Played for a few minutes while I ate and then couldn't take it anymore. 

Left ASAP. 

Won't return."}
{"text":"This is the most unfriendly bar I have ever been to.  I was in there watching Sunday football games and gambled $200.00 and drank beer while I was there.  I went to leave and the bartender Jenn chased me out the door and said I needed to pay my tab.  I said I have been gambling for the past two hours and I should be comped for my drinks.  She was extremely rude and so was the waitress when I threw the bitch $20.00 for my 3 beers and took my $5.00 tip back and said I would never walk into this bar again and I will tell everyone I know not to bother going to such a rude bar!!!"}
{"text":"Still one of the best places to chill, eat, gamble, greet! Jen still quarterbacking a winning team"}
{"text":"Kind of a hole in the wall but nice people!  Staff did a great job with all of us.  I was there for a christmas party for a real estate company so most of my interactions were with those people, not regular patrons.  BUT, one of our co-horts sat down at a machine and hit the PROGRESSIVE ROYAL within her first $20!   Not bad..."}
{"text":"Chill atmosphere great music, JD IS AWESOME, very comfy here.. I will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"My husband and I have tried a few local bar and grills around Las Vegas.  Putter's definitely rates as one of the best.  The breakfast items were good and they have pretty sizable portions.  Definitely worth your money."}
{"text":"WARNING tall blond bar tender saidThey don't comp any drinks that aren't well. Only beer. Can't get a jack n Coke or anything. She said doesn't matter if u play 100$ still can't comp. new rule implemented since a week ago. Then she went to the bathroom while smoking a cigarette.. Uh no thank u rather go somewhere else.."}
{"text":"Rolled into the immediate area on a mission.  After much success, I chose to meet with a buddy at this particular location. 

Walked in and found a relaxed location with one bartender coming off shift and another coming onboard.  The transition was seamless.  The beers were never neglected.

Rest assured...that if I ever purchase from the nearby sister property again, I am gonna compliment said purchase with a tasty barley soda."}
{"text":"good food late night drinks are yummy and fair prices, happy hour makes it even better, bartenders are friendly and outgoing, one of my favorite places to go with my lady"}
{"text":"This is such a consistently great local bar. The food is amazing and there's plenty of gaming for the gamblers but darts and pool tables too! They've really done such a nice job with the upgrading, very inviting. Definitely hit this place when Lemon is bartending, he's great!"}
{"text":"If you live close to this place, you'll definitely want to go here.  I used to live on the NW side and used to go here a lot.  Here's a few reasons Putter's will always be awesome to me:

-Angelina's is back in the kitchen.  Not five star dining, but wayyyyyy better than average bar food.  The Angelina's guy that comes out to take your order is very helpful.

-I consider it a blue collar bar, but I'm a white collar guy, yet I make friends every time I go here.  I often feel out of place at blue collar bars but not at Putter's.

-Good atmosphere no matter the occasion.  Wether you want to grab food, get drinks, meet friends, have a date, Putter's is a go-to.

-I once \"slept\" with a girl in the women's bathroom while on a date here, got caught, and didn't get banned for life.  People just thought it was funny."}
{"text":"Nice little bar in Las Vegas with good service and they pour heavy drinks. 

Be nice to your bartender people!"}
{"text":"This is a great local bar with great food, there staff is extremely friendly and provide great service. If your looking for a good local bar to go relax and watch sports events this is the place to go..."}
{"text":"the new manager is a rude bartender and scaring people away"}
{"text":"Always a great time.  Great prices, great food specials, and Jenn, James, and Sean are some of the best in the business."}
{"text":"I went with the pyro and french fries. The food was great and the bartender Shirin was very helpful and friendly. I'll be back"}
{"text":"I'm bias because I work here. I love this bar though. It's never too crowded to get a drink. Angelina's has awesome food. Good music and lots of TV's. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"I totally dig this bar, the bartenders are the best! I live near this bar and wish the pateons and bartender was on every corner. I do not wish to have a bar on every corner but if I did, it would be this one - with the same bartenders!"}
{"text":"Bartenders change monthly. The manager is a disgusting pig w women, the restaurant has been a few different places, separate from the bar so you need to tip both for service. Back to putters now, still a little drug spot."}
{"text":"Ryan is awesome! Dude has been here since we moved here in 2006 and he's always dope. Always a great vibe in here no matter what time of day. Highly recommend coming here for the food and drinks and the hospitality!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I live right down the road, as do most regulars here, so it's a pretty prime location. Food here is bomb, and everytime the cook comes to bring us our food, my boyfriend always makes a point to tell him he throws down in the kitchen! Food and drink are sooo cheap here, we ate 3 burgers with fries, had 3 PBR's, and 2 Redbull/Vodka's and the total came out to $24.68. Usually I have a Long Island Iced Tea, because Lemon, the bartender, makes the best and I only drink it when he makes it. I also love Kristen, her drinks are lethal but amazing! She's gotten my boyfriend sh$&@faced on multiple occasions, and it's been hilarious every time. The bartenders here are the bomb, they make this place awesome tbh. Ashley, the waitress, is always so cute and friendly too, she's awesome, and I give her so much credit for having to deal with these old drunk bastards day in and day out...some of them are so obnoxious! All in all, awesome place to kick back, have a drink and eat. Especially if you're broke, like me lol."}
{"text":"don't ever order food from angelinas next door an want to drink a beer while you wait for your order...well at least not when chance is working...an most importantly not when your black!!!"}
{"text":"Had the greek pizza here yesterday. Very impressed with the service and the food. Very good pizza for a bar. My fiancé liked the Club Sandwich that we got to go."}
{"text":"Good spot to go to after work with strong drinks and good service. Granted, if you're an Ass you're probably gonna get shit service, and you probably deserve it. I would try to avoid during peak hours since it can get slammed during and there's only 15 seats at the bar. The food here is not great so I'd come here for the bar only."}
{"text":"It's a Putter's. It's kinda dive-y. But what is nice about this Putter's location is the bartenders and local patrons. It's actually enjoyable to hang out here. It's never crowded. The machines will eat your money. But you'll have an above average time."}
{"text":"My husband had been raving about some sliders he had here a while back so we decided to stop by on our way home from the movies. 

We walked in but weren't greeted, we were just asked if we were 21 and asked to present our ID's which we did. After that we were told we could sit wherever we wanted and the bartender took our drink orders, she was not friendly. 

After a few minutes, a waiter emerged from the back, the bartender asked him to bring out our drinks to us, he placed them down and handed us menu's. My husband said it wasn't the same menu as last time, so the waiter mentioned that they had just moved into the kitchen, so it's now Tony Big's Pizza N Pasta, serving food inside of Putter's, he also said they weren't accepting debit at the time, only cash. We still decided to order anyways. 

Item's Ordered:
-Chili Cheese Burger ($7.75)
-BBQ Crispy Chicken Sandwich ($8.99)

Our food came out quick and piping hot. The fries were crispy, plain, but still good. My burger was good as well, the patty was seasoned well, it was juicy, and the bun was soft and fluffy. The burger was topped with shredded lettuce, string onions, mozzarella cheese, and chili, which also had good flavor, but I felt that it needed more chili powder. I didn't try my husbands chicken sandwich but he said it was great, messy though so beware. Our waiter was very friendly, checked up on us to make sure everything was good, he was very attentive, and brought out condiments before we even received our food. Excellent service, good food. As for our beverages, the bloody mary I ordered from the bartender was good but as I stated before, she was not friendly, nor was she attentive, so hopefully next time we come in, there's a different bartender. I'm only rating 4 stars because of the restaurant, but I'll be back because I want to sample more food on the menu."}
{"text":"Came back after moving away for 3 years. Used to frequent and love this place. Now, bartenders are outright rude. TV's weren't working both times. Food is mediocre and outsourced to another company. New layout is awful. Spent a ton of money here over the years. NEVER AGAIN, not one dime."}
{"text":"Awesome bartenders (Ashley & Jennifer) they were awesome. They told me the food and drink specials. Were pretty helpful with the \"craft\" beers on tap. I had awesome mozz. sticks and  flatbread. Bartenders were attentive and helpful all-around. It's kind of a smoky \"bro\" bar but the food and service make it worth it. I will be back sooner then later!"}
{"text":"Great place for the post-swing shift crowd. Be warned: Gavin is really good at his job. You might come in for a quick drink and leave f***ed up"}
{"text":"Nice little neighborhood bar. Nothing fancy. Good prices, ice cold beer, sports on the TV, darts, pool table, and shuffleboard. Pretty much everything you could ask for. They serve good pizza next door as well. Rarely is it crowded. I'd give it 4 stars, but then more people might start coming. Just kidding...3.5 stars would be more accurate."}
{"text":"Good place, good food, not smokey, and nice workers. Enjoyable place"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch, food was good however service was extremely slow. Our server openly complained that she had too many tables."}
{"text":"Level of Dive Bar-ness: 7

* Nice locals
* GREAT FOOD, surprisingly
* 3 Pool Tables / Darts
* Nice staff
* Lots of TVs (around bar area)
* Happy Hour is from 3 - 7

- Always dead when we go here
- Weird restaurant area that is ALWAYS empty
- Kinda morbid \"Lobster Claw Machine\"
- Perfect place to bring a date you don't want any of your friends to see/meet
- Needs a new coat of paint"}
{"text":"Great food! We went in about midnight. Not real busy. The bartender waited on us and gave us great service though we didn't get alcoholic drinks. 

The tea was horrid, but we are Southerners and very picky on our tea. My mom asked for a root beer, and was accidentally given a Dr. Pepper. Other than the drinks (Dr. Pepper was great), it was a nice experience. 

The food was phenomenal! Had a BBQ chicken sandwich, mom had a burger. I can't believe it was so inexpensive!

$20 for food and drinks for two people. 24 hour place. What more can I ask for?"}
{"text":"Food was ok -  not fabulous, but hey it's bar food. The restaurant was rather empty so service was exceptional. What bumped them up to 4 stars is the fact that they now are on Restaurant.com.

This morning, we wanted to take our 3 starving teenaged boys out for breakfast, which would normally cost about 50-75 bucks (they'll each eat a big platter of food, then get pancakes or french toast for sides)! 

We pulled up restaurant.com, and Putters came up as a new restaurant. We ordered a $25 gift certificate and used a code to get 80% off. The certificate cost $2, and breakfast ended up totaling us $22 after the coupon. But man all the food those boys consumed was worth it. 

The boys all ordered chicken fried steak and it was a large portion, crispy and flavorful. I had a skillet with made to order eggs, home fries, peppers, onions, cheese, and bacon or sausage. It was exellent. 

We were very surprised at how delicious the food ended up tasting. We hope they end up remaining on restaurant.com, as we'll quickly become regulars."}
{"text":"Great bartenders, average ambiance, typical bar food, which isn't bad, nothing stands out for me here, just the friendly staff is the sole reason I come here."}
{"text":"This place is a small, smoky bar complete with TVs, 2 pool tables and 2 dart boards. Service is ok and if you're sitting at the tables like we were you might not get any service if you come too early in the day. The beer was cold but the food was mediocre at best...They have happy hour daily from 3 to 6 pm, as well as a daily food special which is all dirt cheap...like 5 or 6 bucks for most entrees. This is a good place to watch sports or play pool/darts, but once you leave you smell like an ashtray even if no one around you was smoking!"}
{"text":"I like anything open 24/7 lol. I've came here a couple times & the service is always good. It's a relaxed place, mostly locals, great prices. 
Came in at happy hour time tonight around 10pm and had the hangover burger (cheese, bacon, fried egg) and French fries which were perfectly crispy & salted. I also had a margarita & a well tequila drink. 
The total for everything was only $21.38. Which is pretty much the same price as one drink anywhere on the strip!"}
{"text":"Hot keno, video poker.. Strong drinks, great people, jackpots!!! Chris, the handsome bartenders also a hero, veteran.. I felt safe there. Great little neighborhood bar. Was my 2nd time there.. he remembered my name.. I hit on Keno,  the day before.  Again on video poker.   Forget going the casino..found my new hang out. ."}
{"text":"Ordered food from the kitchen here and it arrived in less than 40min...fresh and steaming hot! The phone order was taken with ease and my order was correct...wings were perfect! The buffalo chicken sandwich was the bomb! So much food and for a decent price I fed a family of 4 ...would order again from here"}
{"text":"The bartender misses behind the bar made me a yummy bloody mary! Haven't had one in years! It was amazing and I got it for free with playing double bonus poker on her bar!  This location is spacious, good for get togethers to play pool, to have a nice mellow drinking night,  good atmosphere, good people, good food! I will visit in the near future when I make it back to  Vegas...my 2nd home that I love!"}
{"text":"Graveyard bartender is awesome!  Her name was Carrie and she had me laughing all night.  Spent way longer than I expected and definitely going back the first chance I get.  My new favorite place..."}
{"text":"Great pizza, and great bartenders. I just don't know what else to say. Two of the best things to have in a bar. This is my new favorite place to go."}
{"text":"Years ago, you could walk into almost any bar in Las Vegas, and find steel tip dart boards and players to throw against/with. Skip to today, there are less than a dozen bars. 

So, when I heard that Putters offered darts, I was skeptical - believing they were darts, soft tip electronic machines for those who don't know how to add or subtract. I joke ... there are some awesome throwers - especially with the size of the targets, when compared to steel tip bristle boards.

Anyway - nice Bar & Grill. Ample parking and one clean facility. Friendly bartenders with nice heavy pours with great prices. Dart boards are kept in decent condition. Separate throwing area with enough room for tables and seating for a blind draw or small tournament. 

As for the rest of the place - I really can't speak much other than it was clean and the clientele all seemed to be locals/regulars, from the conversations I could hear. Seems like a great local bar offering a little bit of something for everyone."}
{"text":"Now, sometimes all you want is to go to a restaurant, get a seat immediately, and get yourself a big greasy plate of fried delights.  Or, well, at least I do.  And when that happens, I go to Putter's and I get the appetizer sampler and shove my little face full of fried mozzarella, buffalo wings, and fried mushrooms.  Then I go home and sop up the grease secreting from my pores for the next week.  But man, is it worth it.

Putter's ain't pretty.  It ain't much of anything, really.  But you can go here for some cheap eats or cheap drinks and the location is fabulous.  It's right next door to the famed Pinball Hall of Fame and Tropicana Cinemas.  It's like a tightwad's cheap date wet dream come true.  And if you DO take a date here and go see a movie later, you won't have to worry about buttering your popcorn.  You can just stick your greasy, oozing face right into the bag and TA-DA!

Man, am I gross or what?"}
{"text":"Best thing about it is its location to the movie theater.  

The menu is pretty big for a small bar/pub type place but oddly it seems to have more than one menu.  If you don't see what you want, ask your waitress and they may make it for you.

The worst thing about this place is that you will leave smelling like a filthy ashtray even if you're only in the dining room.  Actually its a toss up - the bathrooms may be the worst thing.  Ever feel dirtier coming out of a bathroom than going in?

Most of the waitstaff is nice but speed is not one of their strong suits.  You will wait, then wait some more.

The prices are pretty cheap and the food isn't bad.  Its no 5 star restaurant but I've never had a bad meal here.  

Their drink specials are pretty much beer only.  Sometimes they have mixed drink specials but not often.  Some of the drinks are pretty pricey considering the type of establishment.

All in all its not horrible for what it is.  Don't go in expecting more than 3 stars and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This racist bar deleted my review about their racist bartender. 

Lmao! They deserve 0 stars . I'll never go to any putters ever again!"}
{"text":"Good spot, there is almost always seating and they will put on whatever you want as far as sports go. The drinks are usually heavy and quick. They have 2 pool table and darts which is smooth. There is a 7-11 next door so you can grab some smokes or a snack if needed. 

All things considering they should have 1 day where your first 5 drinks are free for customer appreciation - now that would be cool!"}
{"text":"I miss my old bartender.  I took my friends here who came in town from DC because we were looking for just a chill night that Monday.  I was telling them how the staff was friendly and I loved coming here for beer, darts, and golden tee.  The bartender was not friendliest, and the waitress was whack!  Monday nights are awful at this place.  Tuesday nights, the bartender still is there, but the waitress is the best!  I recommend sitting at one of the tables and letting her serve you, avoid that bartender like the plague! Unless you're a women, he seems to love them.   

I'll check back in a month or so and see if it gets any better,"}
{"text":"S.O.S. First night in Vegas... Went to putters and had the rudest bartender ever. Went to a bar right around the corner from my family's house. Super chill and quiet when I walked in just what I was looking for. Bartender greeted us very rude but grabbed our beers fast. He was gone for a bit which was cool but asked him about a \"special\" on the board that was a shot. Was only half way thru my beer. He then told me to calm down and in was a joke and he could get me a bottle of water in the rudest voice ever. Re take your TAM."}
{"text":"Great deal on Mondays; all you can eat spaghetti with meat sauce for $5.99. Excellent taste and delicious garlic bread to boot. Hands down a great deal, especially if you have a big capacity for devouring insane amounts of food like yours truly. ;)"}
{"text":"This is one of the few bars walking distance from my house. I heard the food wasn't that great so I have only had drinks there. Unlike Jonathan G's review, the staff has been great the few times I've gone and the drinks were cheap. I would pick this place over a Steiners or Timbers if you're in the mood for a few pints."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this bar! They are always in top of the drinks and make sure you're not waiting long. Sean, James, Krystin, Tammy and the rest of the staff is amazing. 

They have a full bar and pool tables along with a nice area to sit in.

Krystin has been serving me all night and it's St. Patrick's day. I'm convinced she is one of the most responsive and attentive bartenders I'm vegas!

You should come in when she's working, Tuesday through Thursday 11pm to 7pm.

Now all you need to do is come down =)"}
{"text":"You'll get service....if the bartender is actually behind the bar LMAO need to get new bartenders buddy"}
{"text":"If I smoked meth and enjoyed getting charged for stuff I didn't order his place would be the bomb."}
{"text":"Great bartenders and mellow environment!  It's great of you wanna play some pool or darts.  More then just gambling is available but if you get lucky the machines can get hot and just keep paying!"}
{"text":"My local watering hole. The food is OK I stick with the pizza for the most part. The white pizza is awesome. I really dig the fried cheese. They use a pepper jack motz. The Ruben is huge and really good and the Philly is awesome too.  Grave yard specials start at 11pm. The kitchen is closed between 3 and 7am. 

Typical bar beers and spirits. Golden Tee, Putt Putt, Darts, pool, Big buck hunter and a mega touch."}
{"text":"Recently started heading back to this favorite watering hole of mine and wanted to repost- they're still awesome. Theres a new night bartender by the name of Guy and he's a great addition to the crew- very personable and fun. Theres a pool league that meets there every so often and the normally dont finish up till after 11pm, but they're all nice folks and the bartender makes an effort to make sure anyone else who wants to play can get set up on one of the three tables thats been set aside for those not in the league.
I really wish they'd set up a late night menu with price specials but besides that it's still my favorite quiet place to hang. Friday nights are nice- not packed but it's definitely moving. Fridays me and my friends dont normally have any trouble finding seats but if theres more than 5 sitting at the bar might be a challenge. The booths are always a great place to pick up a game of munchkin tho so its not like its been a heartbreak for us if the bar is out.
Service still rocks, very aware of their surroundings and no one seems to get out of hand ever because of staff.
Roaming on my own Ive no problem being here into the wee hours of the night, pool still cheap and drinks pretty reasonable :)"}
{"text":"Excellent bar experience. Went to Putters to watch the Indycar race and Jaime was extremely helpful and friendly. She explained the menu and suggested an IPA beer that I had never had. She is a good bartender. Will be back to party it up!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Not too noisy, not too crowded. Couple video games, pool, awesome horseshoe bar, high tops and booths. Really nice people too. 

Food/Drink: Great drink specials and prices aren't all that expensive to begin with. The really surprising part was the food. I didn't expect such a nondescript bar to have great food. They have sweet potato fries which are one of my favorites. They have some tasty sliders and the fried mac and cheese is also recommended. The Frisco melt and spinach-artichoke dip are pretty tasty too. I found myself eating the dip even after I was full just because it tasted so good.

They're open 24 hours. Kitchen closes at like 1 AM I believe so if you're looking for food, get there before that. There are other Putter's around town, I can only put my stamp of approval on this one and it's awesome."}
{"text":"I love this place any time of the day. Some of the friendliest bartenders in town and great bar food 24 hours of the day. Also has a great jukebox. Tell em \"Bill sent you!\""}
{"text":"Last night my friend and I decided to stop by this bar for a quick bite. The evening started off with our server Yazmine, taking our drink order. I voiced my preference to draft beer and asked what Sam Adams seasonal was on draft. The server didn't know and went to ask to bartender, when she came back she said \"Yes we have the seasonal\" to which again, I had to ask what the name of the beer was and she still didn't know. In the end I ordered the regular Sam Adams and got it in the bottle *sigh*. At this point I have let this error go and did not say anything. Next, we ordered food; my friend got the chicken parm sub and I asked for the philly cheese steak with no onions or peppers and tomatoes on the side. When the food came, Yazmine asked if the order was correct and that I wanted everything on the side: bread, steak, cheese, tomatoes. I told her no, I just wanted it with no pepper or onions and tomatoes on the side. She proceeded to tell me that she repeated the order to me when she took it and this is what I wanted but she'll go and fix it for me. Later we also asked for waters which came after we were already done with our meal. Working in the food and beverage industry myself, I have never come across someone so incompetent. How does a server not know what beers are on draft? And if you were unsure of the accuracy of the order why not just double check? I mean, who would order a sandwich with everything on the side in the first place? Seeing as Yazmine had no other tables whatsoever, there is no excuse for the simple mistakes that were made. 
The food was delicious so kudos to the chefs! This is the only reason I am adding 2 stars to this review."}
{"text":"This is your typical neighborhood, the beer is ALWAYS cold which is a plus!! The bartenders are friendly and make sure you have a drink. There is also a food menu, but I have not seen it nor have I eaten there before. I like to go in for a drink or two, especially during games. They are always showing any game whether its basketball, soccer or football. I"}
{"text":"This place is actually really cool! I can't believe I live down the street and never been here. Just your everyday locals bar and grill type of feel. Looks like they get plenty of regular customers because the bartenders knew a few people by name! Great customer service I forgot my bartenders name...well I had two but they were both great! If you are looking for a chill place to just have a few inexpensive drinks and play some keno and or video poker than this is your place! They also have a big screen TV under the pool table so for those sports fans and people that like to play pool you are covered! I want to return soon to try out some of the food!"}
{"text":"A cool local bar. This place is always open and they do a great job serving alcohol and food. The service is almost always on point and quick. I've been in there when it was dead and when it was packed both times are fun. If you go during football season they have a lot of good specials and games you can play."}
{"text":"I have only come to this locatiopn about a 100 times or so and i cant say that there is anything to complain about. Kyle my amazing bartender is absolutely fantastic. I love the food, the drinks, and the atmosphere. There is a lot of usuals at this place and everyone gets along and chats up the night. I love it!"}
{"text":"I should know better by now than to assume that a video poker bar will have decent food, I've come to learn that just is not the norm here. However since this place had 4 out of 5 stars I asked myself, \"how can they possibly mess up a turkey sandwich?\" 

Well, I found out. I placed a to go order and brought home the food, they didn't have ventilated to go boxes and didn't poke holes in the styrofoam so by the time I got home the french fries were a soggy mess as was the sandwich. The sandwich was a turkey, avocado, and mozz on sourdough. The sandwich was literally dripping when I picked it up. I opened the sandwich to see if the inside was salvageable, the turkey was extremely dry and flavorless when I took a bite.

I also ordered a queso blanco appetizer which was bland, watery, and had a chalky consistency. It was by far the worst queso I've ever had in my life, completely inedible. I ended up throwing everything in the trash.

Maybe they were just having a bad night but I will never be giving this establishment a second chance to find out."}
{"text":"It took me a lot to only give one star.  Brian the bartender is rude. Everyone else is great.  Nate and the manager are good people.  Unfortunately, this guy is going to run off the business."}
{"text":"Place is like Cheers, and my boys Jon Jon and Nasty Nate work here who are some of the best bartenders. Cheap drinks and good food. Better pool tables then most places, darts, PAC-man, shuffle board, and a jute box. Suck it doggy! Place is dope. I always have a blast."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised.

My sweetie and I were headed for \"Yolks and Stacks \",  in the same strip mall kinda thing, upon approaching said establishment, we beheld a line - and worse - screaming children. The last thing I wanted to hear while dining is a shrieking child.
I cast about, and saw \"Putter 's Bar and Grill \" . We went there.

This Putter 's is a kinda average looking Sports Bar on the inside, but nice, and the seating is adequate and comfy. We ordered. BLT and Fries for sweetie, Buffalo Wings and a Bloody Mary for me.  The BLT and Fries were excellent! A huge sandwich and the fries were light and very tasty. My sweetie was very happy with her fare. My bloody Mary was done just the way I like - extra spicy. Very Good. My Wings,,,  They were excellent and Very flavorful, much, much better than expected. I would most definitely eat here again. Our server,  named Crystal, was nothing short of awesome,
 she was the bartender / waitress on duty,  and she did her job very well,  spreading good cheer :-)

Overall, Putter 's was a very pleasant experience, and the food was great. A happy and unexpected find. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Putter's has trivia every Monday night where you can win free drinks and money depending on the number of teams. The QQuiz trivia team gets 5 stars but unfortunately the service can be a bit spotty and the food is just meh. Luckily they make up for it with decent happy hour specials on both food and beer. If you are looking for fun trivia give QQuiz a try on Monday's at 7PM!"}
{"text":"Went in Friday night and the middle-aged bartender told me drinks were comped as long as I was playing video poker. Mourning having to put down my 17-year-old bichon that I've had since he was six weeks old I switched up my drinks to Long Island ice teas. I put $20 in machine and was losing until I hit four of a kind so ordered another drink. Had a ton of credits and I cashed out with $23. He paid me and said now I'm going to have to charge you $7 for that last drink. I thought how petty the casinos don't operate like this. Please join me in my boycott of Putters. I even tipped him. I would give 0 stars if Yelp wouldn't let me. Bartender needs to be fair and communicate. He said your going to keep playing and I did."}
{"text":"What the hell happened? I used to love the charred wings here. Have been a regular for years. All the sudden the charred is not charred. They don't do hatiyake. And the regular hot is nothing more than ketchup and salt. Whoever messed with the recipe should be hanged. Used to be 5 stars. Service is awesome. But down to three because of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Favorite neighborhood bar.  Good bartenders, good food (now Angelina's runs the kitchen), and good folks who come in."}
{"text":"A nice laid back and casual restaurant/bar where me and my wife can have an early morning grub and brew.
All Tv's are on  sports and not the news or movies."}
{"text":"Putters on west Cheyenne is a nice place to unwind after work or even stop by for lunch.  Had the large pizza and it was great."}
{"text":"This is the last place that I will go and  would recommend to avoid unless everyone else is closed within a five mile radius which is very unlikely in Las Vegas. 

The reasons are. 

Pay tables suck. 
Drinks are weak. 
Servers are rude. 

Just avoid them."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times since I get my car serviced right next door.  It's been a while.  I remember it being just your typical local bar restaurant with tables/booths.

They have since changed so you walk into what looks more like pure bare with a few tables but big open space, dart boards, pool table and the very first thing with only 3 people in the place was smoke hitting you full force. 

I dropped my car off at lunch and figured I would grab a bite, relax and just wait.  The food situation is weird.  The kitchen is one company but everything else is another... or I think that's how it worked.  Two different servers.  Two different tabs.  Food was decent pub food and pizza.

Kitchen service was prompt.  Bar service could have been better.  I know when it's slow and you are working and have a friend to chat with it might be hard to remember to check with your 3 customers and see if they need anything but a glance over the shoulder every minute or two isn't terribly hard.

Overall, it was pretty disappointing.  Lack of adequate ventilation and surprisingly high level of smoke for so few people meant sinus problems for me for days.  (Usually I'm OK with casinos and other smoking areas even though I'm a non-smoker...so it really was pretty bad.)"}
{"text":"Beautiful, friendly staff and excellent service. Food and drinks are great...gaming and pool tables and it's right down the street from my work.  New hangout, not a crazy/dance bar, but a nice place to sit and chat, or even spend some time with yourself in the company of nice, professional servers and bartenders."}
{"text":"Once upon a time I use to come to this place to meet friends for late night drinks and to hang out.  That was a long time ago, when it first opened.  Now, I only stop by when I take one of the cars in for servicing next door at Ted Wien auto service, which was the case during my most recent visit.

It's a nice place to hang out and have a few drinks while you kill time.  There are video poker machines on the bar, but since I don't gamble I hung out at one of the tables near the bar and surfed the web on my iPad.

The bartenders were very friendly and bored.....they'd talk to a rock if they could, so you should have some nice company too.

Overall, it's a pretty cool neighborhood bar.  They serve food, but I wasn't hungry the day I was there, so no food this trip.

{"text":"Haft leave a new review because I have come more often recently!  All the bartenders are amazing ESPECIALLY BEN!! There is a free check in offer for fireball! They have a jukebox that is a newer version of course!  Prices are really good. They have the option to play pool, shuffle board, and dart boards. They have the option for the better dart boards but FYI bring your own steel tips! Good food and chill atmosphere. The only down side is that it does get kinda smokey! :("}

{"text":"I have been eating at norms for years. The staff is great. It's clean. The food is wonderful. And to top it all off the owners name is really Norm. I highly recommend norms."}
{"text":"This review is for Monday night trivia which just started at Putters.  I love pub trivia, so that's what brought me to Putters for the first time.  For dinner I had hot chicken wings and a couple of Landsharks.  The Landsharks were great, the wings not so much.  They were a little dry and needed more wing sauce.  The food is on par with a PTs, maybe not quite as good.  Although judging from the other reviews, I should have tried their pizza.  Even though the food was mediocre, what made Putters stand out to me was the great service and very clean bar and bathroom.  Apparently, Putters is smokefree because it was also not a smoky nightmare.  I would definitely go back to Monday night trivia and will reserve my judgment of the food until I have tried a few more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Ordered a BLT. Simple sandwich right??? Bacon was hard and cold. It was hard enough that I chipped a tooth. Couldn't even finish 1/2 of it. The toast was burnt on the edges. Sodas were warm. 
Bartender was non existent when I told her about my tooth. Never came to check on us again, never offered a soda refill. 
Hubs plays pool there, but we will eat somewhere else from now on."}
{"text":"Cute place! Scary outside great inside smells fantastic, not crowded or sweltery. Jeremy was fun and has jokes! Walked in moody, the calm unassuming atmosphere chilled with a side of music was definitely a game changer for me! The adorable icicle lights are great for a mellow illumination that's easy on the eyes. I cannot believe I just now found this spot."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood bar.  The staff is super friendly (if you are) and is ready to chat it up.  The drinks were good and not expensive, we had some potato skins with drinks which were really loaded, lots of cheese and bacon.  They served them with sour cream and a marinara sauce, I ended up liking the marinara sauce a lot.

Lot's of games around and even have video poker, etc at the bar.  I like that it's close enough that we can ride our bicycles up, have a few drinks and be home in minutes."}
{"text":"I've only been to Putters once and that was last night. I was waiting for a pizza at the Angelinas on sight. So I swaggered on up to the bar and ordered a pint of Amber. The bar tender was right there and took my order right away. He showed me the same respect as he did to all of the obvious regulars which he knew all by name. The other server there was friendly too. She just sort of came up to me and asked how I was doing. She wasn't even there to take my order. Just being friendly.

A few sips into my beer I looked up to see what else was on tap and one in particular caught my eye. A seasonal brew from Shocktop called Shockolate Wheat. Interesting. I started talking about it with a friend over the phone. I told him I was at a PT's. My bad. This was most certainly a Putters and I felt bad about calling it by the wrong name. Anyhow, as I neared the end of my beer the bar tender came over amd asked if I wanted another. Then he mentioned the Shocktop and how I had been eyeing it. I was intrigued but not ready to try a full pint. So he poured me a sample. A lot of bars don't do that so I was pleased that he did. I was tempted to go for another round but by this time my pizza was ready. So I settled up at $4 for the Amber and I was on my way. I've got to go back for that Shockolate Wheat though before its gone."}
{"text":"I didn't expect much from Putter's but...

1.  Beers for $3 a pint
2.  Classic Rock on the juke
3.  Cheap billiards
4.  A good attentive and courteous bar tender

All made for a good couple of hours"}
{"text":"More of a bar than a restaurant.  There are three or four booths for eating as well as a couple of high tables.  Then of course there's the bar area.  There are also a couple of pool tables.  Seeing as how it's mostly a bar, the smell of smoke was overwhelmingly strong.

For an appetizer we had the spinach dip.  It was a bit too creamy and could use more spinach.  It wasn't very warm when it came out either (not that big of a deal as the dip usually cools off before it's finished anyways, but I wish it would have started out hotter).

I had the reuben sandwich.  It was alright.  The dressing and sauerkraut were good.  The meat (I believe pastrami, but it may have been corned beef, I can't remember) was a little dried out.  The bread was a little over toasted.  It was an okay size, but I feel $10 was a little too much money.  The fries were good, not too thin, and not too crispy either."}
{"text":"This place is okay. Its close to home. I like the bartenders here, Sean and Jay are amazing. This place has pool tables darts just a fun spot. The customers at night are rather sketchy tho. As far as the food its a hit or miss. The metza piss is delicious as well as the sliders. I got a philly once and it wasnt the best. But like i said its a hit or miss."}
{"text":"As an out-of-towner, I really appreciated the down-to-earth atmosphere at Putter's.  My great uncle took me here and it was clear that he has been here often with the VIP treatment we received.  

And as my uncle had mentioned months earlier, they do have fantastic wings.  You can order them \"charred,\" and they make up the wings, and then finish them off with a searing on the grill.  It makes for the most moist, and crispy outside wing that you have ever tasted.  They come in teriyaki and original buffalo, and we had two bowls of about 40 wings for the 4 of us.  

Their salads are HUGE.  From the house salad to the chef salad, they are impressive.  The clam chowder, as the soup of the day, was excellent too.

The beer and drink prices are normal here compared to the strip.  You would need a taxi or other car to get there if you are staying at the strip, but it is a nice change from the overpriced drinks and hit-or-miss food choices on the strip.

So now I can officially say Putter's is my favorite wings place in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour. Great prices even without the discounts. Breakfast all day and food served till 3 am. Live across the street. chill divey-like bar. Food is great. Great sliders and fries. Cheap pool and other bar games. Small but staff is very friendly and welcoming. Will definitely be a regular now.  If you into the dive chill atmosphere this is the spot. And food is greAt. Did I say that alreAdy? Lil buzzed. Idgaf. This bar got me here to this point with my man. We Gavin a good 'ol time. Have fun!"}
{"text":"I come to Putter's for QQuiz, six rounds of trivia every Monday at 7 p.m. Service can be hit or miss in both the dining room or the bar, but the quiz categories and prize money my team (usually) wins makes up for it.

The food is good, and pretty standard for bar fare. I'd recommend the chicken nachos or the chef salad. If you have the best team name for QQuiz, you get a free beer, and if you get at least 45 points (out of 60), you get a free shot. 

In summation, after said free beer and shot tonight, Putter's gets three stars, but QQuiz gets them an extra one."}
{"text":"Love this local little bar. The bartenders are so friendly and attentive that it's rare to be sitting with an empty glass in front of you. Ashley, one of the servers is usually working and she is a complete sweetheart! She's familiar with a lot of the regulars but she's very welcoming to all. 

The food is surprisingly good and always comes out fresh! My favorite is their buffalo chicken wrap, it's bomb and comes with the crispest fries. They even add avocado and bacon in the wrap which makes it that much better. 

There's pool, video poker, and plenty of TVs if you want to watch a game. Not a bad local spot at all."}
{"text":"I've been visiting Putter's for over seven years now and the service has always been excellent!  

They have great food which is always served in a timely manner and the bartenders always take care of you.  

You can shoot pool, play darts, or play those video golf and that new video dart game.  

Want to relax?  I visit with my friends from the Hawaiian Golf group every week and they have been coming into this location for almost 10 years!

Highly recommended and I'll see you there!

{"text":"We stopped in here for dinner because we'd just finished our first visit to Glazier's Marketplace, and we had a restaurant.com certificate.  Not long ago we went to the Putter's on Cheyenne and weren't blown away by it, but the atmosphere here is totally different.  You'd never know it was the same chain.  This one has ambiance, nice lighting, and a terrific bar area with comfy, upholstered benches and high tables ringing the perimeter.  We sat at one of these, since the dining room was closed.

Kyle, our server, doubled as the bartender (and maybe tripled as the cook, too).  He was terrific - got everything right, even when I played \"Five Easy Pieces\" with the turkey sandwich I was ordering (rye instead of sourdough, pepper jack instead of swiss - no problem!).  But I'm getting ahead of myself.

We started with Spicy Fried Pickles - six spears that were hot, crisp, and superb, served with bleu cheese dip?  I don't know, because they didn't need any dip.  

My turkey sandwich was big, hot, grilled, and delicious, and I was amazed to discover that it was real roast turkey!  Kyle said they roast the turkeys on-site.  My husband had the reuben, and it was also big, hot, grilled and delicious.  For our sides, we skipped the fries and ordered a side salad (no extra charge).  For a side, it was huge, served in a ceramic skillet-shaped dish, and had a mix of iceberg and romaine, three big slices of cuke, onions, carrots, cabbage, and chopped tomatoes.  

The only thing interrupting our dinner experience was the two young women from Long Guyland at the bar who were plastered, and shrieked and cackled constantly, that is until one of the two got up and let some guy rub her boobs for what seemed like an hour (but was probably a minute and a half).  That provided the visual entertainment, so I guess this Putter's has it all.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I read the few previous reviews for Putter's, so my expectations weren't high.  Our Friday Night Fearless Foursome drove there in the rain.  Instead of choosing to feel like royalty in the totally empty dining room, we opted to sit at one of the high tables in the bar area.  It wasn't crowded, and no one was eating, so my expectations for the food dropped a few notches lower.

Surprisingly, everything was very good.  Not fabulous, but there was nothing to complain about (after Sid, our waiter, swapped out our rocking table for a more stable one).  I had a glass of Piesporter Riesling, a good-sized pour that ended up costing only four bucks.  My husband had a Newcastle on tap.

Our quesadilla appetizer was big enough for the four of us to share.  My friend's club sandwich had very moist turkey.  I had the open-faced Monterrey Chicken sandwich, but instead of the sourdough, I ordered it on a French roll.  The bread was like all the other bread in Vegas - it sucked.  Well, that's harsh.  I guess it was okay unless you're not Vegas born and bred.  But the filling was very good, with a moist chicken breast, lots of avocado, tomato, cheese and onion.  Sandwiches come with fries, potato salad or cole slaw.  My friend had the fries, which were decent, and I had the cole slaw, and it was very good.  My husband had a bowl of chili - cheap, but everything but the chili is extra - a dollar for the bowl size, a dollar for cheese, and seventy-five cents for chopped onions.  Still cheap.  The last entree was the chicken fried steak dinner, and our friend said it was tasty.

All in all, our dinner at Putter's way exceeded our expectations.  I wouldn't give it a rave or travel very far for it, but if you're in the neighborhood and looking for some decent bar food, it satisfies,  it's reasonable, and it's also on restaurant.com."}
{"text":"Ashley the waitress and Kristen the bartender are awesome!!!!  Great local bar. Very laid back atmosphere. Good crowd and the drinks are reasonable. The service is great and the entire staff is really good. It's a great place to go for a chill night to play pool, darts, or gaming."}
{"text":"We always enjoy frequenting this bar.  We go once a week for pizza & drinks.  Ryan & Sid are fabulous & Kimmy is such a great gal.  Always a good time & unstressful !"}
{"text":"We stopped in here before my pilgrimage to the Pinball Hall of Fame.

Walking in, I was immediately taken by the smell of smoke. Living in Los Angeles, I'm not used to walking into public places and smelling that.  It wasn't overpowering, just unexpected.

Right when you enter, there is a large rectangular bar with video gaming built into the bar.  To the right is the dining area.  Think Elk's Lodge style chairs and veneered tables that have been wiped down so many times that the wood finish is turning white.  

Jeff ordered the sliders and I got the taco basket. 
Jeff's sliders came with 4 small burgers and a mountain of fresh and hot french fries.  Under the fries there was a buried pickle.   The small buns were actually kinda fancy. They had been grilled and the burger meat wasn't dry.  There were some delicious grilled onions on the burgers, too.  It was a huge meal, despite being an appetizer special.

I got taco basket.  Three ground beef tacos.  There was a bit of lettuce, a bit of tomato and a pound of cheese.  I was in heaven with the cheese.  I dumped the lettuce, tomatoes and ate them with the cheese.  There was a small container of salsa, but it really had no flavor.  The tacos were actually smaller than I had expected, but they were tasty and not greasy.  

The food was much better than I had anticipated.  It was reasonably priced, too.

Our server was obviously tired.  We went in during the early afternoon, after the lunch rush, on a Saturday.  I think the poor thing was just beat.  When she was around, she was great, but it was hard to find her.  We almost left because no one came to take our order for several minutes.  

I would give this place 3 stars for the food, but the darkness, the smoke and the slower service brings it down to a 2.  However, the next time that I am the Pinball Hall of Fame, I might consider getting something to eat here."}
{"text":"Popped in late last night..can't believe I've lived just blocks from this place & never tried it out.
Great bartender who was extremely welcoming & nice. 
A few pool tables & good music! 
Pretty sure you can order food from Angelina's Pizza."}
{"text":"To say that the service is pathetic would not accurately quantify how bad this place sucks.  I have been here twice now, both times on Friday nights with Jen as the bartender. On my last visit (tonight) she spoke to me once during the HOUR I was at the bar to get my drink order.

Once she had my order, she went back to the activity that I obvioulsy interupted her from: talking with her friends.  Unfortunately, one of said friends was sitting next to me and I was unable to avoid overhearing some of the things coming out of her mouth.  I really thought I was at a Marine Corp bar in San Diego... grotesque language.  Not to mention casting expursions on quite a few customers after they left (I can only imagine what was said about me).

I see these good reviews, I was even checking them from my phone while I was in there, and I made it a point to Check In to make sure I was in the right spot.  The reviews I read do not accurately reflect the service I saw this evening.  For one, most of them are quite old, but two... Tell me what days to go in because I need to witness \"service\" from this dive to believe it exists.

I will not be back, beyond that, I would steer a friend far clear.  Especially in this neighborhood - there are 15 other bars within a mile."}
{"text":"This is a good local pub. They have good food. You can even play pool, watch aliitle football .  People seem to be friendly.  Good place to go to watch a game."}
{"text":"I heard the Pub Trivia here was fun, so I brought a dozen friends and we had a good time.  Happy Hour prices are decent and I recommend the beef tacos - they're well seasoned and very meaty!  The wings were just awful with too little sauce, though the sauce itself was no good either.  The ribs also had a woeful lack of sauce.  The spinach dip was great and shared well.  The pizzas look pretty simple and they're single-serve, but my friends all liked theirs.

The trivia itself is what keeps us coming back.  The prizes are cash, which we love.  Although we hate the \"torture round\" where one team gets to pick next week's topic, and they always pick something only they know.  So all the other teams sit there frustrated for twenty minutes.  They really should change it to like 3 questions, so it's a little point boost for that one team, but doesn't piss off the other 90% of player every week."}
{"text":"Misty is the best bartender here!! Come on in and see her!! Putters is a fun and very relaxed place to hang out. Pool tables, darts, golf, and shuffle board!!"}
{"text":"I've never been to a Putter's before and I see them all around town.  From the outside, it's all dark and I had no idea what I was walking into.  What a surprise to find a brightly lit diner place with a bar, large screen TV, and pool table.  

It's late Saturday evening and grabbing a seat at the bar, I ordered a mixed drink while the BF ordered a beer.  We inquired about getting change for the pool table and the bartender said it was free to play pool!  Cool!  He just had to open it up for us.  The pool table does get stuck a few times, which is probably why it's free.  But hey, we didn't mind.

When our party of ten plus people showed up and surrounded the pool table, we ordered more drinks.  After a couple of drinks for the both of us, we headed next door to the Red Hookah.  The BF was pleasantly surprised with how cheap the drinks were when he closed out his bill.  And I was impressed with how kickback the place was and how cool the bartender was too.  The BF even would consider making this his local bar if it wasn't way across town for us.

Overall, we were pretty impressed with Putter's on East Tropicana.  The cool thing is that we plan on hitting this place first to grab some drinks and play a couple of rounds of pool again before we hit the Red Hookah next door.  (And if we're hungry, we could come back and grab some food too!  Nice!)"}
{"text":"Great gaming bar. Mike gallant is a fab bartender. Love coming here and hanging with the cool crowd. Def come and check it out. Gaming is amazing."}
{"text":"Went here because my co-worker talked about how good it is.  I beg to differ about this one!  He said the burger was huge....It wasn't, he also said the fries were awesome!  Um, they were limp, and they weren't crispy!   I'm glad I decided to split my burger with my co-worker, because it would have just been some wasted calories!   I almost forgot that I went here, if it wasn't for this popping up for me to review it!"}
{"text":"I walked in today and sat at the bar.  The bartender took my order got my drink and never repeat never came back to see how I was doing, if I wanted another drink. The food was good and the waitresses were very nice but I don't know what problem that bartender had. He never smiled and acted like he didn't even want to be there.  I felt like I shouldn't be there   Ive been there a few times before and the bartender at the time was very nice I think his name was Koz. (The nice one)"}
{"text":"Putters is as reliable as you can get, regarding getting something decent to eat at any time of the day or night.
They're within walking distance from my home, and whenever my wife and I go there, we walk.
They renovated the place a number of years ago, and the new look is much less dive-like than it used to be. 
Their breakfast is better than average, and very inexpensive
They have skillet breakfast and all other breakfast staples.
I like their lunches because they are large portions. The first time I ate lunch there, I ordered the 5 lb burger. It was one of the rare times that I needed a doggy-bag.
Their only downfall is that they don't have a complete wall separating the restaurant from the bar, so at times, you can smell the cigarette smoke, but if you eat there really early or really late, the smoke isn't an issue.
The servers are nice (especially the breakfast servers. My wife always tells me that they flirt with me too much, but their job is to get good tips, and I like the attention).
I don't know what more I can say, except that writing about their breakfast has suddenly made me hungry."}
{"text":"This place is wacked. The restaurant and bar are separate businesses so you get two bills, two servers, and the two don't cross over. Left my dirty plates at the bar where I was sitting and the bartender walked by them three times, waiting for the restaurant to come by and pick up the dishes. The food is bad. The bar has published \"house rules\" that are printed and placed prominently across the bar.  There are reality shows about this kind of place on TV."}
{"text":"A little dive bar. Drinks were not to bad and happy hour  food was typical happy hour food nothing to extravagant. Couple pool tables darts plenty of room to get a little crazy!!"}
{"text":"They always say to order the beer rather than well drinks for a reason. we both two different drinks, and they ended up tasting exactly the same and highly watered down. The bartender was really cool and nice, but the drinks were absolutely terrible. Did not try the food here as we only stopped here before a movie."}
{"text":"This Putters has slots, 2 little pool tables, dart games, and the BEST BARTENDER EVER... James!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent bartender. Machines are kinda tight. I didn't have any but there is food available."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and was definitely not happy with what we got and this is the 2nd time in a row this has happened.
My cheesesteak had about 1/3 of the meat it used to have, they didn't put any mushrooms or green chilis as requested, and now they use cheez whiz instead of the melted provolone goodness that they used to.
Wife's salad was mediocre and mainly consisted of lettuce rather than the salad that we're accustomed to. To top it all off they don't use their loyalty stamp cards anymore so not a whole lot of reasons to be going back."}
{"text":"For starters, styrofoam to-go boxes with fried food inside need to have holes poked in them, otherwise the fries are completely soggy and not worth eating 10 minutes later. That kind of oblivious disregard doesn't sit well with me.

Ordered the queso blanco. It was watery and gritty and tasted like sour milk.

My buffalo chicken wrap was okay. A little salty but it didn't suck. At least I didn't throw them away, like I did the sour milk queso and soggy, limp fries.

Never again."}
{"text":"This is the only Putter's I've been to, but I've been here quite a few times.  This is our usual stop before we head into the Tropicana Cinemas for a dollar movie. 
This bar isn't fancy, by any means.  It teeters right between \"divey\" and \"nice\", without touching either side.
Drink prices are reasonable, and the bartenders are really good at customizing drinks for you.  No one's ever complained about making a trip to the kitchen just to get some Atomic Horseradish for my bloody mary (which is usually billed as just a \"vodka well drink\".  Sweet!).  In fact, the bartenders there are really enthusiastic about making everything just right.
If you're hungry, and you're at this bar, do yourself a favor, and get a taco basket.  The tacos are awesome.  I would avoid almost everything else on the menu, as nothing else I've tried there has really impressed me. 
The pool tables are a nice addition.  There are 3 or 4 of them, and they're reasonably level for bar tables."}
{"text":"The food is ok. It's typical bar food. Fries were good. I tend to go to local bars but I think there are better options like Distill and Village Pub if you plan to play a little video poker. I went to Distill and lost $60 on the machines but I had 4 beers and a shot of tequila over the course of 2 hours and all the drinks were comped. Putters limited me to 3 beers for the same $60 so I think there's better value in the other bars. I understand that they don't want to give 6 beers for $20 but if you have $60 or more in the machine, they should relax a little. Just my opinion. They were friendly though."}
{"text":"Since I'm new to Vegas checking out local areas is on the top of the list.  Met up with a few co-workers for Monday night Trivia that starts at 7pm.  I think they have happy hour from 4-7 with 2.50 drink specials and extended past 7 for those playing Trivia.  The host is pretty good and interactive with the crowd.  Like most MC's you feed off the vibe of the crowd.  They have top three prizes and categories that range from history, tv shows, movies, casino chips and everything in between.  Plan to be there on Monday's going forward.  
I didn't try the food this past Monday so I can't tell you anything about it.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  
The place looked good for small groups or large crowds.  Crowd ranged from young 20's to mid 40's from what I saw on Monday.  People coming straight from work to people dressed in sweats that came straight from the gym.  Nice local place to hangout."}
{"text":"If you like getting hit on by silver foxes all night and having to listen to shitty early 70s rock every time you go in then this is the geriatric place for you.. bar has some potential though the atmosphere sucks."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start. Walking into this Putters it seems like your regular mid to low class almost but not quite a Dive Bar (this can be good/fun if done right but this location doesn't exactly hit the mark).

When you walk in everything seems normal and pleasant. About 8 locals sitting at the bar trying their hardest to forget about life for awhile. The Bartender is quick to great you with a smile and I took a seat. It was at that time I noticed a live lobster tank set up as a game. Put your money in and go fish, if you catch one they will cook it for you. I'm no PETA freak and I love seafood but I couldn't talk myself into gambling with having a non seafood restaurant cook a live Lobster for me.

When my Fiancé and her friend arrived they started gambling. They lost a good $50 and had two drinks a piece. Not a single comped drink for either of them. Only one of them had a winning game on the poker machines; A whole ten cents.

Our food, well I ordered their version of the Supreme pizza it didn't impress my inner Pizza Parlor snob. Way too many olives, not enough cheese, and my pizza was served 15 mins after my Fiancées Greek pizza. She didn't like hers at all but when she put a slice of her pie on mine she said it was pretty good and wished she had followed my lead. Her friend desperately wanted dessert but there was nothing in stock.  

Her friend was ordering the fancy Cosmo/fruity drinks and the bartender kept having to send the cook next store to buy milk, fruit etc to make the drinks. Sitting there I googled the store and found this was the location that was on Mystery Diners. Now if we could just get Robert from Restaurant Impossible there they might just get a chance to succeed.

I'm never afraid to try somewhere new but I won't be back."}
{"text":"It's local dive bar and i absolutely love this place and always have a great time there. The late night food is really good and the breakfast is huge and delicious. The drinks are good too and if you gamble you can get a free drink. The only problem is that you can smell smoke everywhere, which can be a problem for non smokers."}
{"text":"I came here specifically for pub trivia and I wasn't disappointed (despite not winning!). There are a lot fewer participants than most of the other pub trivias in town, meaning better odds, hahah. The ladies were host it are fun and welcoming. I highly recommend this place for trivia. 

The food and drink specials were pretty darn good as well. Good value and a great time was had by all. I tried the corn dog bites with fries and my trivia partner, Carolyn S tried the beef tacos. My food was delicious and so was hers. Happy Hour lasts until 7, which is a plus, but the food is reasonably priced either way. The drink specials kick butt as well. They are cheap and the service was pretty quick.

I will definitely be back and I can't wait to do so."}
{"text":"cool operation.  family booths for dining & bar w/tabletop gamblin machines for the adult drinkers/eaters.  i had fun playing video black jack & enjoyed me some tasty comped cocktails. i had the spaghetti & stromboli & they were above average.  good prices. nice staff.  i wouldn't hesitate to go here when in vegas. glad it's a chain."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this local spot! Jon and Jen are awesome, my food was amazing and the service was superb.  Definitely would recommend this spot to my friends."}
