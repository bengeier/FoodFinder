{"text":"Found this place by chance whilst on a road trip going from the U.S. to Canada and what a find!
An unpretentious working class Diner with very friendly staff serving no nonsense food.
We had a huge plate of hash to share, toasted home made bread and muffins with local butter plus lashings of coffee, all for the ridiculous price of $7.82!! Still can't believe we'd not, through a trick of the time/space continuum, been beamed into the 60's!! 
All time travellers please set your dials for Filion's Diner!!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for breakfast for a business trip. Nobody was in the parking lot when we got there at 8AM, but by the time we left the place had filled up.

I don't know what more you could ask for. Good, friendly service; low price, show up hungry because you get a lot of good food cooked well."}
{"text":"We went by this place twice during a visit to the area, both for breakfast. The place itself is a \"greasy spoon\", and the interior probably hasn't been updated in many a moon. But, it comes down to the food, not the decor. And, the food, was great. I also learned a lesson. When a restaurant has both an omelette and 1/2 omelette listed... it may be best to get the 1/2 omelette! I ordered a full ham omelette and there must have been 1/2 a pound of ham in it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining... it was much better than the sprinkling of diced ham most places give. I had to actually  take about 1/3 of the omelette with me. I also enjoyed their home fries which  they gave a huge portion of, as well as their \"Homemade toast\", which was thick and fluffy. We also had their French Toast (with Homemade toast), which was excellent.

They have a breakfast buffet on Saturday's, and I'm always up for checking out a breakfast buffet.. so we went back. The place was packed. I got the buffet, while my wife went for the French Toast (with Homemade toast) again. I frankly regret not doing the same. The buffet had watery scrambled eggs, bacon that was far from crisp, lukewarm sausage and some sort of hash.. which didn't taste like corned beef, had a strange texture and I didn't care much for it at all. However, it did have French Toast (regular bread) which was very good... although it didn't save the buffet for me. I guess I should have looked at the buffet before ordering it, but after the previous fantastic food we had off the menu, I just assumed the same.

Overall, fantastic breakfast... if you order from the menu. The price was right, and the portions were great. If in town, or passing through, I'd definitely go there again. It was hard to do a rating because of the great menu food, and lackluster buffet experience. I knocked 2 off for the buffet, but added 1/2 back because coffee is only $.37 there. Since I can't give 1/2's, they get a 4 :-)"}
{"text":"Yum.  Seriously.  Look at the amount of fries you get with your burger!  Filion's had delicious food and plenty of options.  Definitely stop by if you're passing through the area."}
{"text":"Good food, big portions, low prices. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"A solid diner in The North Country. Not too many good home cooking diners left, this is one of them. I challenge you to finish the potion of fresh cut French fries that they give. Meatloaf is one of my favs."}
{"text":"Nice hometown type dinner. Amazing prices..  I enjoyed a grilled cheese with tomato and a bowl of soup for $4.00!  Great!"}
{"text":"What a great surprise to find on our drive home to VT from Ottawa! Glad the restaurant we planned on stopping at was closed and we found this gem! Great food, super nice waitress, and very reasonably priced! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"An extra star is for the personality of the waitresses here. I work around the area and we have alot of down time right now so we used to go here for breakfast everyday. Needless to say that stopped after my pants started getting tighter but its a great local spot. Once you go a few times they remember your beverage preferences and you are given your drink without asking, I am not used to that kind of service so it's a nice change.

Breakfast is definitely better than lunch to me, they have platter sized pancakes that wow you if your not expecting it. Depending on the day of the week you will have someone different preparing the food so sometimes you get your meal in 10 mins sometimes its 30 mins...either way its loaded with buttery greasy goodness. 

Don't expect anything healthy here, I asked for some fresh fruit once and got laughed at. Aside from the pancakes there is great home made bread, the omelettes and home fries arent to bad either. You can pretty much ask them for whatever you want if they have the ingredients and they will whip it up for you and do some creative math at the register trying to figure out your bill."}
