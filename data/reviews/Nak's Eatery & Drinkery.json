{"text":"Nak's is bigger than I expected with a decent menu and plenty of beers. Service was very friendly but a little slow, then again there were only two women working on a Friday night. The menu is burgers, sandwiches, salads, wraps, and fish fry on Fridays (at least 5 items from each category), making for more options than most similar venues. The bar itself is medium-small, and most of the seating is high-tops, but there are two large tables than can each hold a group of 10.

I think we were the youngest group (early 30's), but that just meant the place was relatively quiet. There were plenty of other local patrons.

The food was great, and they put on the Indians game on a nearby TV for us. No complaints; we'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Mr. Chornak is the BEST! Without him our entire firm would starve during tax season. Thank you for always being there for us. Your food is AMAZING"}
{"text":"They should probably just shut down. One person working on a Saturday night, both bar and tables. Said a half hour wait and has been an hour. Don't waste your time there's better food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Big black hair in my sandwich.  Obviously not taking extreme measures to ensure a sanitary kitchen.  Never eating here again."}
{"text":"They keep it simple at Naks. They provide a limited menu of simple short order food, and they do it right. The service is always good and the place is always clean. They have a wide selection of bottled beer, and a few on draught. Try the burgers, always great!"}
{"text":"Their burgers are great. Nice little place to eat at. It's a bar but their food is restaurant quality."}
{"text":"Normally Nak's is a safe choice.  Not tonight I ordered my burger to be cooked medium and it came out well done or burnt.  My son ordered a burger with just barbecue sauce and cheese....it came out with bacon.  My wifes shroomin burger had g. rilled mushrooms but raw onions.  The wings were goid and the bar maid tried hard but she had 10 peiple at the bar and 3 tables going.  Should have had 2 ladies working."}
{"text":"Great place for food and fun. Excellent service. The food is delicious

Owner Tim does catering as well and we use him for a lot of events. Wonderful food and unbeatable prices."}
