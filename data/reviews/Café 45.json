{"text":"Although I had enjoyed my first experience at this cafe, I was quite disappointed with my second visit. The service was slow and inefficient, largely due to the fact that there was only one server on duty, and he interrupted my order to attend to a lengthy transaction (entirely unrelated to coffee or food) with someone who walked in after me. When I politely expressed  that I was in a rush, the server was unapologetic and told me that I should have come earlier, and that I could request a reimbursement. While the server did eventually try to compensate for the delay by giving me a small side serving of pasta to go with the wrap I had ordered, the belated gesture was insufficient to erase the unpleasant feeling he had given me. To make matters worse, the overpriced food was completely bland. I had high hopes of making this cafe my regular stop before heading to work around the corner, but it looks like I'll have to find another place."}
{"text":"New cafe which opened in the place of the tea shop on prince Arthur. Owned by the owners of the building themselves. Lots of nice public seating area outside during summer due to renovated roads. Interior is cozy and cute, huge picnic tables with jugs of water in every table. Really quite cafe so great for working and it's open late as well. There are sufficient charging outlets as well. Lots of plants. Their coffee is supplied by a toronto based roaster, they roast some of their stuff in Montreal as well. The beans are not as widely distributed as 49th Parallel, Phil & Sebastien or Bows & Arrows so you definitely get a unique blend here. The beans are available for sale as well. Small number of baked goodies also available. I tried the chocolate bread which was all right (nothing spectacular). But I really liked the cappuccino, it had a coarse tone without being sour or bitter. The service is great, the barista is very friendly and not pretentious or condescending. Bonus: all prices are tax included! So my cappuccino was a well rounded $3.25. This place is hopefully here to stay."}
{"text":"I love this café that is super bright and spacious, only two three big shared tables surrounded by beautiful urban jungle. I fell in love with the amazingly nice vibes of this café from the moment that I stepped inside. The menu is not super varied but everything that my friends and I took were great. The service was good and quick, so I appreciated that a lot. I tried their matcha latte and it was good, but not out of the world. My friend told me that they serve good cookies and bagel, so maybe try those out. There's also a boutique part in the back of the café, selling organic and vegan products, the display is just so beautiful! I really enjoyed my experience at this beautiful cafe and would recommend it to everyone!"}
