{"text":"The food was cook faster and very tasty.  I pick up less than 5 minutes after I ordered. Delicious food  and good services, highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"This place is in a rough Neighborhood when I first got bought here I was sure about the place I didn't really wanna walk in either but I'm glad I did ! This place has the best hibachi fast take out . Very very very good I never had a bad experiences with this place and they give you lot of food for a great price"}
{"text":"This is my favorite hibachi place in Cleveland! Really great for big groups, large portions, and beautiful/classy atmosphere. The chefs put on a nice show while they're cooking for you and are very chatty/friendly. I enjoyed the appetizers and sushi menu. I suggest splitting the hibachi with one other person."}
{"text":"We ordered online and picked up. We definitely over - ordered because we had assumed that the portion sizes would be small, as the items were priced very affordably. We were (happily) mistaken. We got two orders of crab Rangoon, two different fried rice dishes and two chicken dishes for $23, and it will be enough for 2 people to eat at least three meals."}
{"text":"Definitely a hood classic lol. Don't let the sketchy neighborhood fool you, the food is really good! I always order the hibachi (light onions) and switch up the meat depending on how I'm feeling. The best bet is the chicken, shrimp and steak. I also order half rice, half lo mein, super good. Huge portions, nice price."}
{"text":"Love this place! New spot in the area serving Chinese and Japanese food to surrounding areas. It's all take out. Everything is made by order and was fast! The Japanese entrees are similar to ones you would see at many other places. The prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get in one order. I will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Very good for the price. Definitely worth $5 for the Chinese entrees we bought. Generous servings, fast service. Must be to go- no dine in option. Location isn't great so wouldn't want to dine in anyway. Nice employees"}
{"text":"Yo.... The food here is amazing. 

The service here is amazing.

That's it. That's all you'll need to know about it. Diet friendly if you make the right options. I recommend the Shrimp and chicken combo plate. I'm eating it now. Crying tears of joy."}
{"text":"The restaurant is in a rough area but it makes up for that with food. The food over all is delicious very tasty. The workers do their best to please the customer. Wasabi is a branch of Sakura thats located on 55th. The guys decided to open another store. This is the exact same food it's Sakura. I normally get the chicken and shrimp half noodles half rice. This is Benihana without the higher prices. I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere were good. I loved everything about this place and can not wait to go back real soon"}
{"text":"Great food and big portions! We always order the chicken teriyaki for $5.99 and it's enough for 3 of us to eat. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Its a take out place only but one of the best chinese food restaurants I've ever had. Fresh made and wonderful cook.
Crazy good prices as well"}
