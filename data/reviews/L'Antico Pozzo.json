{"text":"Obviously touristy but the food was really good (as almost everywhere in Italy ;-). Great pizza, the risotto was really nice as well. We have been lucky, but at lunch time it was pretty crowded and it might be hard to get a table."}
{"text":"Grabbed a mid afternoon pizza here on the day of my arrival to Bellagio. Prices were about 10 per pizza. Pretty tasty thin crusted pizzas."}
{"text":"Bof bof... Pizzas décevantes avec L impression de retrouver des aliments de boîte de conserve en garniture ... (Champignons et artichaut). Peut être les autres plats auraient été meilleurs. Coperto hors de prix (2,20 euros) mais c est situé la zone hyper touristique ... Petite cour agréable malgré tout..."}
{"text":"This lovely eatery hidden in the Bellagio old town offers a standard but well executed Lombard  staples but specializes in locally caught fresh fish.  The desserts were exquisite. House wine is good at only 12 euros."}
{"text":"Great restaurant on top of the hill, great pizza, great vino rosso, best caprese salad we had in Italy."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant with excellent customer service!  Enjoyed a lovely lunch on the patio - pizza fantastic, risotto amazing, beef carpaccio outstanding.  Highly recommend it if you are looking for a quiet place to enjoy Bellagio away from the lakeside."}
{"text":"Great location, nice outdoor seating, good food, friendly service.   We randomly stumbled upon this restaurant while trying to pick a spot in the alley-ways of Bellagio. We liked the outdoor front patio for people watching. My husband and I shared the following items which made for a nice light lunch:  - caprese pizza (thin crust, light red sauce and fresh tomatoes and mozzarella) - Greek salad (no dressing, but plenty of tasty cheese and olives. I'm sure they would have provided balsamic and evoo if we had requested)  We mainly enjoyed the casual outdoor atmosphere, but the food was also great."}
{"text":"Super. Friendly English-speaking staff and really really good pizza. Stop by if you're in Bellagio and like us, did not make it in time to get lunch at Ristorante Bilacus."}
{"text":"Visiting Bellagio a beautiful tourist town Lake Como. Italy is renowned for its great cuisine Italian style. It's a pity in such a tourist place you have wait staff not really into their job,and the food choice not great,tasteless and poor quality at a above average price. The Italian cuisine at this restaurant is very average, just enjoy a glass of the house red and enjoy the location."}
