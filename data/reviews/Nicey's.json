{"text":"Nicey's jerk chicken marinade is as good as any they sell or any I've tried. 
They stopped making the spicy version to my dismay, but the regular is still great."}
{"text":"Had their jerk chicken with rice and peas, and oxtail with the gravy sauce of course. Came with some onions, beans, and a banana. Went in with high expectations and it definitely met them! Great taste but sauce wasn't as juicy as I hoped. Might be because I ate it 20 minutes after (takeout only). 

Normal jerk chicken spice level, really good portions. Regular will keep you full. Banana tasted like potatoes which was cool, never had it like that before. Id come back, not weekly. Pretty popular place though. Definitely would want to try their goat soup next time (they ran out)."}
{"text":"I was in the Toronto area for some work training and was looking for some Jamaican food for dinner. This place was near by the delta Markham where I'm staying at. Got the curry goat and jerk chicken combo. The goat was awesome nice and savory and mixed with rice and beans was the bees knees but the jerk chicken was pretty dry which is pretty unforgivable for Jamaican food. If I was visiting the area again I would go again to try the different entrees ."}
{"text":"Been coming back here the last few months. The jerk pork is great. The flavor and spice level (I like it hot)  are fantastic. The jerk wings are a must have. Service is great as well."}
{"text":"Niceys food is usually really good. Good job to the chefs, who i never see. I ordered jerk wings the other day and they were amazing. Their curry goat is always on point. I'm not a fan of the oxtail I find it a bit salty.

At Niceys, what you see is what you get. It's great when you're on the go and just need a delicious meal.

My only gripe about the place is one of the women that works at the cash. A short short slim young Indian woman. She is incredibly unpleasant, acts as though she has better things to do than take your order, even though that's her job. If you ask her a question she mumbles the answer while rolling her eyes. I think she is fairly new so she may learn to be a bit more pleasant but her attitude is very off-putting. If she continues like that I hope they let her go because a lot of people find her extremely rude."}
{"text":"I found the most authentic Jamaican cuisine in the GTA made right here at Nicey's. It may not be located in a popular area, but the line up goes to show the amount of people impressed with their food! 

Some of the must-order items include the jerk chicken and the ox-tail.. (I'm now drooling as I type this) accompanied with awesome rice that's also packed with flavor that will deodorize your car. The ox-tail is my favorite item - the meat is so tender it falls right off the bone. It's simmered in spicy gravy that goes really well with the festival (which are ONLY $1 each). 

Overall, the prices are very fair for the quality you get. Beef patties on display are only around $1, what a deal. Exotic drinks like \"Sky Juice\" and other labels you won't usually find elsewhere can also be purchased.

I highly recommend Nicey's if you want to indulge in some authentic Jamaican cuisine made with love."}
{"text":"Got to try the jerk chicken with rice and peas.  The chicken was moist and juicy albeit a little under-seasoned for my personal taste.  Nevertheless, the price was right and the food was fresh."}
{"text":"Your food is good, but your portions are very small.
$ 12.00 for 4 pieces of oxtail & rice???
The rice was old and very dry!!!

Disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Nicey's makes one of the best jerk pork, ackee and salt fish in the GTA.  That is, if you like it spicy.  If you cannot handle spicy food, I would recommend you go elsewhere.

I took 1 star off because of the inconsistency over the 20 odd years. 
For example: one time,the jerk pork was slice up like roast beef.  It just didn't taste right, jerk pork needs to be chopped up.
Another example is the portion:  I always order the dinner sizes, but the portion feels light a few times when I ordered it.

When in the area, I will always pick up some take-out since I don't know anyone else who makes jerk pork this spicy."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place. Just off of Vic Park, just north of Finch. So, I made a stop in today. I think that Nicey's chicken roti is going to be a new Christmas Eve lunch tradition for me. 

The roti was not too big, not too small. I inhaled this bad boy. So good. Perfect consistency, and they don't try to put potato in to create filler in their roti's. For just under $8, you can get a fabulous chicken roti that will fill you up and put a glorious blissful smile on your face. And now....I need a nap! 

This plaza is a one stop hoppin spot. Next time when I stop by I am going to check out the grocer next door (Nicey's Food Mart). 

Note that this take-out does catering as well. The line up was out the door (at 2 pm), but I didn't have to wait too long. Also note that there is no place to sit down and eat, so you will see some happy people eating in their vehicles. 

My only disappointment...no doubles : ( 

Debit is accepted at Nicey's. 

Be sure to check out the website - they even offer up some of their recipe's!"}
{"text":"2 words JERK WINGS!!!! nom nom nom...SPEAK NO MORE!! Their a la carte menu is pretty great and amazing as well."}
{"text":"Awesome jerk chicken. Line up out the door at lunch. The rice and peas were moist and fresh and had super flavourful pickled onion on top. Those with me had roti and said it was a new local favourite. One asked for it spicy and they added peppers it was flaming hot (which they enjoyed). I am looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I didn't have as good a time as the past Yelpers at Nicey's, maybe I am the ONE that tried what no one else comes to try.  I walked in and the decor makes it obvious that its a Caribbean take-out joint. What else makes it feel like that was that the lady there was behind the peak hole.  She didn't seem to enthusiastic to see me or another customer but nonetheless she didn't do any bad either.

I had to ask what Breakfast items were available as I have experience at other places that sometimes not all items are ready to serve.  I got the Callaloo & Saltfish($5.30) and was asked if I wanted some Food which I said yes but maybe I should have said NO.

Callaloo was A-OK and Saltfish was very limited as I searched for my bits and pieces.  The Food was Boiled Bananas, Yams, and Dumplings which was all tasteless but I didn't mind that as much as that it was all HARD as a rock.  When you have starchy or carb items like that, it makes it impossible for a person to consume even when I can stomach a lot more shit.  Trust me on that!

I guess this review AVERAGES Nicey's out and that they have some simple fixes that can make their Breakfast take-out as popular as their Lunch.  I got to say IF I ate all that starch and carbs, I would have been full all day but I'll need an iron stomach even stronger than the one I currently have."}
{"text":"My favourite place for Jamaican food!

Prices and portions = great value and of course, when you add the authenticity of the food, it becomes a winning combination!

Another great thing I like about this place is that even though they have an extensive menu, I've never been told that they are out of a particular item.  Maybe it has to do with being attached to their own Jamaican grocery store but there is nothing more frustrating than having your heart set on something only to be told that they've run out.

I also have a habit of ordering more than enough items for myself to make sure I have leftovers. The leftovers make great lunches at work I must say.

I'm not going to proclaim to be an expert with Jamaican food but I've always enjoyed what I've ordered from here which is usually Jerk Chicken, Jerk Pork, Ackee & Saltfish, or Curry Goat and they have certainly matched, if not bettered those of the competition,"}
{"text":"Nicey's is a decent place - great for takeout when craving Caribbean food when in the Markham/Richmond Hill area and you don't have time to venture too far. 

I ordered the ox tail, jerk pork, jerk chicken. The ox tail was pretty good..decent amount of gravy and the meat was moist and tender (not dried out). The gravy is a little on the thick side. 
The jerk pork was really good with a nice amount of spice kick. If you can't handle spice then the jerk here is probably not for you. I am down with spicy food so I enjoyed it!  The jerk chicken was good as well."}
{"text":"Decided to give Nicey's a try. We had the jerk chicken dinner. This is the first time I've ordered this dish and NOT have to ask for hot sauce. May be too spicy for some but I liked it. While spicy, overall flavour was just ok. The real downside was the chicken meat itself which was dry and had the look and texture of yesterday's reheat.  Proportions and price is on par or slightly higher than other jerk places I've eaten at. Service is on the slow side for a take out only joint."}
{"text":"Food was sub-par. I ordered Jerk Chicken; wasnt the best ive had, but wasnt the worst.  Seemed like the chicken was old and reheated. However it was moist, just could have used more seasoning. My boyfriend had the curry goat
The service was ok... a little slow. The lady at the counter seemed not enthusiastic about taking our order
The worst part of the meal was the pickled onions they put on top (was it supposed to be steamed onions or a play on coleslaw? there were a few pickled carrots too. yuck) it did not fit with the dish at all. what happened to the traditional steamed cabbage or veggies?"}
{"text":"Friendly, efficient Asians running this joint. 

Ordered the following:
-Oxtail meal with peas and rice (came with a piece of plantain and one dumpling - both bland) - the meal was savory and delicious but a bit salty.
-Curry Goat Roti - filled with tender goat but watch out for the bones.
-Jerk wings (75 cents per segment) - Flavorful, mild to medium spicy and yes salty.
-Rum cake (from Sweet Delight bakery) - dense, fruity and very potent. Reminds me of a fruit cake without the fruit. Took two bites and I was done.

Will try their \"sit down\" restaurant on Markham Rd (Scarborough) where the menu is more extensive (Roasted and fried breadfruit or how about some cow feet?) and the rum cake is made in house."}
{"text":"Really expensive for the quality and portion size.
My whole container was basically plain rice with some beans.
No flavour whatsoever to anything, and they garnished the top of the food with terrible pickled carrots and broccoli. Felt like Chinese takeout. 

Hairy jerk goat. Nasty."}
{"text":"Nice takeout place. I like that they offer a lot of portion size options for meals and a la carte. The callaloo and saltfish tasted good (although I've never had it before, so no comparison). The festival is a fried dumpling that's sweet like a donut."}
{"text":"It was really good food.Pork and chicken rice and peas is really good.Nothing beat it.
You show go try it if you haven't been there"}
{"text":"Like the name states, this place is purely a takeout joint.

I asked the 2 girls behind the counter which were the most popular dishes and I picked the Curry Goat with rice and peas.  At just under $11, it's not super cheap, but it's good for approx. 2 portions, and boy was it yummy!

Goat was nicely cut into equal, bite-sized pieces and fall off the bone tender.  Of course, like most West Indian places, it was salty, but tasty.

Food was packaged quite quickly after I ordered!  No nonsense type counter."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Nicey's Take-Out.

As its name states, it's a take-out restaurant.  There is a small table along the window and that's where I ate.

I ordered a jerk chicken dinner with rice and peas.  It was a heavy platter!  The rice and peas were good as was the chicken.  The chicken had a nice kick.  I wasn't fussy about the fried plantain but I'm not a fan of it anyway."}
{"text":"I tried a Jamaican beef patty here and it tasted like a patty that came out of a microwave. Although it had more meat than others I felt rather disgusted after finishing it. My co worker felt the same way. I haven't tried any of the other food items but after this bad experience I won't be going here again."}
{"text":"Nicey's take out is great - as is the grocery store, a few doors down.  It is such a pleasure shopping at this location.  GOOD variety and quality of product, nice, hot and delicious hardo bread ... and a fantastic variety of seasonings.  Was there today.  Always leave feeling good - this is a wonderful establishment and they truly deserve five stars.  If you are looking for pumpkin from Jamaica, escallion, Scotch bonnet and other seasonings, this is the place for you.  Oh, and I forgot --- fantastic Blue Mountain coffee and a variety of baked goods ..."}
{"text":"I visited tonight and had the jerk chicken dinner and my boyfriend had the jerk pork plate (with a dumpling). Both come with a side of seasoned rice and beans, steamed onions and carrot and coleslaw.

Chicken and pork were perfectly done, very moist and not the least bit greasy. The rice and beans were seasoned with the right amount of kick and the onions were steamed and added a nice sweet touch to the otherwise savoury plate. The dumpling was a nice side but a bit too many carbs for one meal!

Great place for an authentic caribbean meal in Markham/Scarborough, looking forward to trying out more dishes!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My boyfriend brought me here for the first time a few weeks ago. It's like any typical Jamaican take out joint, nothing fancy. But and this is a big BUT and something I complain about often.. They actually look like they don't hate their life. They smile , give good service and the portion sizes aren't small. 

I ordered a jerk chicken with rice and peas and oxtail gravy. The white meat was tender and flavourful, my food was smothered in oxtail gravy and they even put some banana in the and a side of coleslaw. It was well worth the price and I will be sure to visit here any time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place has been on my bookmark forever because I have loved Caribbean food forever - but even more so since my trip to Jamaica last year. Came here with no fuss and got a small oxtail and small jerk pork with their delicious rice and peas. I dont know why i didn't bring myself here earlier and more often. The jamaican food here is how it should be. Oxtail was definitely better than the jerk pork, and next time im gonna try to chicken and some ackee and salt fish. My mouth is watering as i am typing this and i am starting to ramble. Just get yourself here already!"}
{"text":"I Love Nicey's but of course, I prefer the location in Toronto.. this location is okay.. I had the jerk chicken with rice and peas and extra oxtail gravy (I also asked for a bit of oxtail meat and stated I would pay Extra) I did not receive what I asked for.. I also got a cream soda, the jerk chicken didn't taste like what I expected.. it was okay but I've had better.. the oxtail gravy tasted great, I wish I got to taste the oxtail meat but again.. I didn't receive what I asked for. Cream soda and rice and peas was decent. The Cole slaw is a mess, I wouldn't bother but my favorite item to get from Nicey's is the Ackee, Salt fish and dumpling I love the way the Toronto location makes it! I love Nicey's I'm a bit disappointed in tonight's location and flavor.. I guess it's okay to have an off day, once in a while, eh?"}
{"text":"Food is always good, but the lineups at lunch can be long. Get there before noon."}
