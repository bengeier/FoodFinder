{"text":"I just had a fabulous Japanese lunch on their upstairs patio overlooking Yonge Street at Heath. Great service, wonderful owner who came over to my table to greet me and my guest. The food was beautifully Japanese  with a modern fusion twist. I will be returning here soon!"}
{"text":"Opened 3 months ago at the beginning of summer 2011.  With the same number of walls as there are windows and two storeys above street level, you are sure to get a great seat.    The owner, Frank, is friendly and personable and makes a point of getting to know you.  They carry fish that is not usually served at your everyday sushi restaurant.  The amberjack sashimi was melt-in-your-mouth delicious and the seafood suimono soup tasted as amazing as it looked and smelled.  For $70 for a couple for dinner, this authentic Japanese restaurant is a bit pricey but is worth every penny you spend."}
{"text":"Gill has indeed gone belly up. The high-end Japanese concept wasn't working, so the owner has rebranded as Lucky Big Mouth Dumpling House. Hopefully the hot and sour soup is still just as good. I'll let you know :)"}
