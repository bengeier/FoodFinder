{"text":"We've been meaning to come by for their Monday momo specials and finally made our way here last week. It's now officially part of our weekly routine - the momo is incredible! Veggie are our favorite, but the pork are very good as well. The entr√©es are pricey but well worth it - they all come with rice and Naan and a generous portion of curry. I love the number of dishes with paneer - one of my favorite. Unlike most restaurants in this style it's not family style.   I have to mention the service - as delicious as the food is, the service at Mount Everest is the highlight! There's such a feeling of caring, the servers genuinely care that you enjoy your experience. Both times we've been the servers were attentive and polite, and so thrilled to hear we enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"I'm very sad...when this restaurant was Delhi Darbar it was my favorite, go-to spot for delicious Indian food. I used to bring friends with me almost every time I went. I've been here a couple of times since they changed ownership and it pains me to report that it is nothing like it was.  The fish pakora used to be plump, juicy and really well seasoned. Now they look like little hunks of battered fish that you'd find at a fast-food outlet in a mall. The samosas also looked like they were of the frozen variety and not made in house.   The naan was still lovely, as were the papadums. Probably the best part of the meal unfortunately.  The dinner buffet usually had a full selection of curries, but today only half was populated with dishes that were fairly bland and lacklustre.   Their butter chicken used to be sumptuous and flavourful. Tonight it was thin, and appeared to have chicken breasts cut into pieces and put in as an afterthought. No lovely pieces of chicken simmered slowly in the sauce to imbibe all of the flavours.   The kheer was still good, but the gulab jamun have appeared to have diminished significantly in size. They also had jello cups on the buffet, which seemed so out of place and really didn't appeal to me.   I'm not sure why they have changed their recipes so dramatically. I understand that early on they had wanted to introduce more Nepalese components, but jello? Even the chai has changed - very heavy on the cloves, so much so that I didn't finish my cup. Again, this used to be one of my favourite parts of the meal here.   I'm afraid that you've lost a loyal customer - competition in this city is fierce and I can name a handful of other restaurants that will satisfy my spice cravings."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding, food was very tasty lots of unique flavour very fresh and tasty. The sauces chutney were the best every! We will be back"}

{"text":"Nepal is not India, it is a separate country and though they use similar ingredients and in some cases have the \"same \" dishes there is a difference in Nepalese cuisine so if you're going to a Nepalese restaurant expecting East Indian food then you will disappointed. Our server was a very pleasant lady and very happy to help us understand the menu. The restaurant has only been open a few months and they are trying to gradually transition the menu to a totally Nepalese menu. Currently they have a mixture of Nepalese and East Indian dishes. The appetizer menu is totally Nepalese and you will find that though Nepalese cuisine incorporate many of the same spices as East Indian cuisine, the flavours are much subtler and milder. They will increase the heat level if you prefer a spicier heat to the food. We tried the MACHHA TAREKO - Basa fillet  fish marinated with Nepalese herbs and deep fried, this is fish in a soft batter so don't expect Fish Pekoras because it's not what they are supposed to be. The fish is deep fried in a fairly thick batter and served with 2 different sauces. Fish was perfectly cooked and the sauces good companions to it. We also had the KUKHURA KO JHOL, breast part of  diced chicken cooked in Nepalese spices. Kukhura means chicken, our server explained. We asked to have it made extra spicy. The sauce is delicious, I took the small amount we had left home, it was so good I didn't want to waste it even though it was probably only 1/2 cup of it left. The heat is a nice warm heat that just hits the spot without overpowering the flavour of the dish. We also tried the TANDOOR CHICKEN TIKKA, tender breast part of chicken marinated with traditional spices. The chicken in both dishes were succulent and moist. I've had Tandoori chicken before and often the outer layer is over cooked but the pieces in these dishes were full of flavour and super moist. In reading the menu all the main dishes come with saffron rice, garlic naan bread and Nepalese salad but for a group they are happy to serve it family style so that you can share. She told us that probably the two mains would feed the three of us and she was right. There was enough rice and naan to go around and we were pleasantly full with just enough room for dessert. I had never heard of carrot pudding so that was what I tried. It is shredded carrots cooked with some spices and I believe cashew nuts. It's is a nice ending to a good meal, the spices again very subtle and the pudding not too sweet. I am definitely going back to this place again. It's getting 4 stars because I'm one of those that now only give 5 when everything is perfect. The presentation on the carrot pudding could do with a little more finesse and the batter on the fish appetizer a little lighter but flavour-wise this place is top-notch. Lots of vegetarian dishes as well. They only serve chicken, lamb or pork dishes. Beef is nowhere to be found which is true to Nepalese cuisine as the cow is sacred to them. They do consume buff which is buffalo meat but I didn't see any on the menu. It's right on 16 Avenue so parking is on the side streets. The decor is pleasant and sitting by the window can be interesting. We saw a police car and the interaction between the officers and the motorcyclists they had stopped. A very pleasant place to enjoy a leisurely meal. They have an all-you-can-eat special buffet on Wednesdays for $18.95."}
{"text":"Tried their Sunday lunch buffet first weekend in August. Black lentil soup + vegetable samosas ...mmm. Goat curry: mildly spiced but flavourful; butter chicken, moist and tender. Their naan isn't greasy, their rice pudding is subtle, and the mango fruit salad is refreshingly tart instead of cloying. Service: friendly and attentive without being overbearing. Definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Disappointing experience at Mount Everest due to poor quality and cheap ingredients.   I was really craving indian buffet and I wanted to make it a little bit more interesting, which is why Mount Everest caught my eye. Maybe the first indication about the quality should have been the fact that the restaurant was dead empty at 6PM on a weeknight. The buffet was very small, which would have been fine if it was all really high quality food, but it was simply not the case.   The chicken chunks barely even registered to me as real chicken - the texture was that of a brined, processed, chicken nugget. The mushrooms in another dish were clearly canned mushroooms. The ingredients being used were of the lowest quality. The saffron rice had zero saffron fragrance or flavour, and was merely tinged orange.   I would never return here, and this has curbed my adventurous restaurant spirit for a few months."}
{"text":"Seriously good!!  Ordered a few items for takeout, fully vegetarian, as follows; aloo tama bodi, vegetable momo, veg chow mein noodles, and garlic naan. All dishes were excellent and the service was exceptional. Staff were helpful and very kind in helping me decide what to order. I've eaten at the Himalayan quite a few times and have to say that Mount Everest is just as good. Only feedback for the owners is to create a bit of a better dining atmosphere with the lighting and decor. Otherwise 5 stars! Will be back."}
