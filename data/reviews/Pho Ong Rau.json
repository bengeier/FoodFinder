{"text":"We had Pad Thai, Pho, Dumplings, and Spring rolls at this place and everything tasted amazing. As well, their service was fabulous. I would say the overall experience with food, service, washroom, and the ambience are pretty good at this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! So flavorful and perfectly seasoned. I would highly recommend. I had the grilled chicken soup and my friend had the vermicelli with chicken and shrimp... Both excellent!"}
{"text":"Big disappointment...long wait...pho ordered wasn't to my expectation...not much in the bowl except for the salty n lukewarm broth.   The imperial rolls were very oily.  Not going back there as much as the owner was reassuring to correct the situation."}
{"text":"I think I'm general enough with this rating. First I ordered a small pho soup without the noodle. After trying more than 10 Pho restaurants in town, I know what i'm expecting for a delicious beef broth. The top criteria of a good pho restaurant goes to the richness of broth and how thirsty you are two hours after you have it (the more thirsty you feel, the more MSG the broth contains). So of course I wanted to try their broth. Very clear and light-colour, doesn't taste strong at all.     For my main course I chose a vermicelli dish with grilled pork & imperial roll. I specified no salad at all except cucumber (which I always do in other places because I hate raw beans sprouts, carrots and cabbages). The waiter didn't ask me to clarify and he did not repeat what he understood from my order. usually the chef would simply replace the salad with a bit more vermicelli, which makes total sense. What I received was a dish with a bunch of salad, and no imperial roll. I returned the dish, asking to remove the salad and add imperial roll. The second time they brought me the exact same dish only with a roll  added on top; the salad was still there. Oh my lord!!!  The grilled meat already became cold by that time.  So i was disappointed about the food."}
{"text":"Excellent Pho de quartier. J'ai toujours été satisfaite, peu importe ce que je prends sur le menu, et le personnel est toujours extrêmement sympathique, cordial et aidant."}
{"text":"Came here last night based on a couple recommendations and loved it. For once, I didn't order the large pho, instead, I opted for the \"table d'hôte\" which gets you one mini pho as a entrée and then a dish full of grilled meats (I chose chicken and beef), vermicelli, an imperial roll and a salad.   The soup was delicious, although a bit salty. Loved the rich and flavourful broth and the meat was very good as well. There wasn't a lot of it though so a bit hard to judge but will definitely be back for just a large pho.  The grilled meats dish was also very good. The meats were grilled nicely and tasted of lemongrass, but I would have liked them a bit sweeter. The imperial roll was really good and properly filled and the homemade vinaigrette for the salad was superb (very garlicky though, best to avoid on a first date lol). The portion was really big, I wasn't able to finish everything and got it for takeaway.  In comparison to other Vietnamese restos in Montreal, Pho Ong Rau: - Looks nice both on the inside and the outside; its somewhere you could actually bring a date to.  - They have beer and wine (not sure about hard liquors) which isn't always the case  - The wait was a big long though, especially when you're used to really fast service and we were only about 12 people in the resto"}
{"text":"Franchement mauvais.  A l'ouverture, c'était un petit resto qui se respectait mais maintenant, la qualité a tellement diminuer. A éviter. Franchement, se bâtir un clientele et les laisser tomber de cette façon, pitoyable."}
{"text":"C'est un incontournable pour tous les résidents du quartier Jarry et à quelques pas seulement du métro pour les autres! Le restaurant est ouvert sur l'extérieur pendant les périodes chaudes et permet de profiter des vents rafraîchissants! La cuisine vietnamienne préparée ici est goûteuse, mais et il y a un ÉNORME MAIS....le temps d'attente est surréaliste! Entre la désorganisation de la cuisine et les commandes à emporter qui s'accumulent et surpassent les commandes en salle.....c'est un cauchemar!  Alors l'astuce si vous voulez manger de la bonne cuisine vietnamienne....c'est uniquement de commander des plats à emporter!"}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of pho (being Vietnamese!) and I am very, VERY picky with which ones I like! The pho here is absolutley phenominal!! Definitely takes the #1 spot. The broth is flavorfull, not too strong/weak. The noodles are cooked to perfection (a little chewy/bouncy, just how I like it) and the meat tastes high quality and fresh. I asked for a smaller portion of pho and the server was very accomodating and kind. I'm pretty sure he was the owner.   Being a solo tourist, I always feel a bit uneasy about eating alone and being new to an area but my server made me feel very welcome as I entered the restaurant. He was kind, profesional and efficient. Definitely 10/10 service. The amibiance is also classy, dimly lit and comfortable.   Would highlyyy recommend this place!! Hands down my favorite pho ever! Will definitley come back here if I ever come back to Montreal!"}
{"text":"We ordered a Pho Soup, rice, and a Mi Xao Don. The Pho soup wasnt good, the rice didnt even arrive and the Mi Xao Don was mediocre. Overall I wouldnt recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok, so the service here is impeccable. Friendly, fast and efficient. Don't need to ask for more water or anything, they will anticipate. 5 stars. Food was good, not amazing thought. I enjoyed it and it was the best option in the area and in a rush. It just wasn't my best Pho. That said, the rolls were good and so was the Pho. If you need a Vietnamese fix in the area this could do the job. *FYI I only had the Pho so maybe their thing is the bowls/plates, and most people I saw had ordered the bowls/plates. I had Pho because it was in the name of the restaurant. Good luck. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Si vous aimez les assiettes remplies de féculents, c'est la place!  Pad thaï tofu légumes, 3 cubes de tofu 5-6 morceaux de légumes et des nouilles pour nourrir l'Asie;) Service au comptoir très très long... Nourriture bien ordinaire"}
