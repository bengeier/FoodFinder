{"text":"Excellent resto, service de grande qualité! Plats intéressants, parfois même surprenants. Les brunchs sont également excellents, préparés avec passion!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Each course was a delight, each sucessive course building on the preceding course.    The dessert was unusual, with parsley cake and molasses mousse that went surprisingly well together.   My new husband and /I (on our honeymoon) enjoyed every bite.   (even though the guy behind the bar was slow in serving up dishes and seemed more interested in chatting with 2 attractive customers at the bar- that was the only drawback to the experience)."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The decor is simple and basic. The atmosphere is great.  The wine list looks great and the two we tried were ultimately fantastic. They have an extensive cocktail list too, I tried the lili co and it was great.  It's a tapas-style restaurant with sharing plates and a changing menu, and we were 5 so I found it a little difficult to share when the orders are so tiny. I thought it would be a great idea to be more diners to get a taste in of everything but I would recommend going in a pair or a trio to get all the flavours in. Everything was tasty and had a pretty presentation but for the price, the portions were quite small. We ordered the platter of steak with the Yorkshire pudding and it was good. This is a meat place. They have a lot of offal on their menu so don't come in if you are a vegetarian or queasy about eating brains, tongue, or penis! The ricotta dumplings were awesome. The octopus was also delectable, melt-in-mouth yum - but again, such a tiny portion that we each only got one teeny nibble. We will definitely try to make our way there again- I hear their brunch is crazy good!!!"}
{"text":"We came with a group of 10 and this was the best meal of our entire weekend. The service was friendly and accommodating while the food and drinks (one friend proclaimed the fresh squeezed orange juice the best he had ever had) were exceptional. All-in-all a great experience, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We were here tonight for the 3 courses($41) Montreal restaurant week menu. My common understanding of a 3 courses meal means appetizer, main course, and dessert. Clearly not at this place. Should've read some reviews here before going. Portions are shockingly, ridiculous small. It's morally wrong to call bite sized dish main course. No bread was served. Each course there's only 1 choice for poultry. The other choice was $5 extra each. We ordered the extra option for both courses. And when it came to the table, it's unbelievable. 1/4 of a normal restaurant portion. A 5 year old will still be hungry after.   Reading previous reviews I found out the chef claimed he went to China therefore a customer should not question his cooking. Well, FYI, in China, first of all there are rice served and if you give this little amount of food to the customer, your restaurant will most likely be smashed or you will never graduate from cooking school before you even open a restaurant.   $135 for two and we went to get a large Pho after. We are slim Chinese, not those over eating 200 pounds people. No joke!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place as it was close to where we were staying in Montreal. The decor is very modern and clean. There is not a lot of seating available; the kitchen is open concept and probably takes up half the venue.  The service was top notch, very friendly staff.  All the food was quite good. We ordered all their \"amuse\" items, which were just small bites for sharing; all were refreshing.  The main brunch item that stood out the most was the caramelized bacon pancake (this was a special, they usually only serve the banana bacon pancake). This was to die for, definitely try this if you come here!!"}
{"text":"Il y a tellement de meilleurs choix à Montréal! Essayé au souper, qualité des plats très inconstante, certains devraient être éliminés du menu. Joue de boeuf poisseuse, ne goûtant que le gras, portions franchement minimales pour le prix demandé. Sélection de vins éclectique (Ce n'est pas pcq c'est bio que c'est nécessairement bon)"}
{"text":"I love this resto.  It is a real Montreal gem, creative cooking, casual, servers who care and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent trout dish, however Yakitori was dry and blandly seasoned. When we expressed discontent with the food and returned half of it uneaten , the chef and manager had a quick conference and then challenged us on what we didn't like.  She claimed that the chef had traveled to China (!) and had delivered us a perfect Yakitori.  Yet the meat would not stand up to street food we've had in many cities for 1 / 20th of the price.  In the end, a dry, bland Yakitori for $18 is not the end of the world but the manager/'server who defends this might want to look at how she treats her customers"}
{"text":"My wife and I had brunch today. Food was superb, service was near awful. We sipped our caesars but our food never came. Finally our waitress came over and asked us again for our order as she said there was a computer glitch. From what we determined there was no glitch but our order never got placed. We waited a long time for our meals while similar orders were delivered to other diners. When we asked why, the waitress apologized and said our caesars were complimentary. Great, but I would have preferred paying for our drinks and getting our meals in a reasonable time. I got the sense she wasn't well trained. I know it's tough to get good service staff but it's also critical to the success of any restaurant. There obviously is great talent in the kitchen but they need it on the floor also."}
{"text":"We happened upon this wonderful establishment when looking for a last minute reservation on the DINR app. Although we intended to do the tasting menu, the suggestion was made to just pick an assortment to share. It was amazing. Hard to pick a favorite between the turnip, mushroom, leek, pork belly, and bass. The five dishes were a perfect amount for the three of us. And the old fashioneds were amazing. Loved the hospitality. Will for sure put on the list for my next visit to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Belle endroit entre amis. Ambiance chaleureuse, les employés sont accueillants. Prix convenable. Endroit suggéré pour des belles petites soirées en amoureux. Cuisine ouverte. Bar cuisine. Peut-être bien faire un menu mieux démonstratif serait le top."}
{"text":"We went to Lili Co for the dim sum brunch they offer for Montreal en lumiere. For $40 per pers., you get 4 small dim sum plates per person. We were disappointed.  In short, it was more or less like dishes served in Chinatown but served over mayo to be trendy, and way too expensive.  Some dishes were good (steamed taro dumplings were delicate and tasty), others were bad (shallot crepes were rubbery and hard; steamed buns were too greasy with a sauce that was too sweet and looked commercial); most were average.   Service was also average. Upon arrival we were told we had to leave in 1:45, even though we had a reservation. Staff was not too knowledgeable about the dishes they were serving.   Total bill for 2 with 2 coffees: $100 before tip. A small glass of tea is $6. Way too expensive for average food. You can do much better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Brunch is amazing. The banana pancake is as good as it looks. The maple caramelized bacon on top is amazing. I have to say the Vietnamese breakfast crepe is to die for. All the typical Vietnamese crepe ingredients explodes in your mouth along with fluffy scrambled eggs and salmon. It's a genius twist to a Vietnamese classic. Chai scone with pumpkin mousse is also delightful. The mousse itself should be the star of the dish.  Coffee drinks are good and super friendly service."}
{"text":"Wow. What an experience. These are people who really love food and know what to do with it. If you love good, un-fussy food and friendly, unpretentious service, you should go to Lili.Co. I had the scallops to start, it was light and accented perfectly with ikura and some crunchy stuff. It was so well balanced you can still taste the freshness of the scallop. I had the pork belly for the main course, it comes with pea shoots and apple & potato purée. It's the kind of dish so savory and satisfying it'll make you happy. For dessert, get the apple tart with foie gras. It's so good it's borderline life changing. Ok it was life changing. Service was great and the chef owner was friendly and passionate and obviously a genius. I can't wait to come back and see what else he comes up with"}
{"text":"We found the food to be of below average quality, but above average price.  Additionally, the wait time was outrageous.  This did not seem to be the fault of idling waitstaff, but of a slow and congested kitchen.  We watched as personal problems amongst the kitchen staff deterred the completion of our meals.  It is quite frustrating to watch as your meal falls apart in pieces, and is served as a sad agglomeration of other peoples problems.  The menu was uninspired.    Staff was perfectly adequate.  Ambiance was unremarkable.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I heard so much about this restaurant, so when I heard they were having a special menu for Montreal en Lumiere, I had to go. They were making a Dim Sum special, at 40$ per person. We could pick up to 4 different plates per person, so we mixed it up and ended up with 8 different meals. I was very disappointed in the food, it was some sort of fusion, mixing some ingredients together that were just odd in general. The staff were not describing it correctly as they were dropping them off, saying it was beef when it was pork, etc. The sticky rice was more of a pudding, not tasting much other than some lemon. The chicken skewer was really undercooked. In general everything seemed thrown together quickly. A harsh price for really average food. I won't be returning there."}
{"text":"Our experience here was pretty fantastic. I'd made a reservation and we were promptly seated at the bar when we arrived (they do tell you seating is either at the bar or at tables).  The servers were kind and helpful and you could tell they truly enjoyed working here. We all ordered the vegetarian tasting menu, as well as a beer for my husband and a bottle of red for my sister and I. We were there 2 hours 45 minutes as they perfectly pace you between each of the 6 dishes in the menu- starting with the tomato & ricotta dish, leading into the second dish, which was probably my favorite- pea brule (which had herbs and some fennel on top), it was unlike anything I've had before! Third dish was a perfect piece of squash with fried zucchini flower, fourth was broccoli in delish miso sauce and 5th was gnocci with mushrooms, including hen of the woods. Last was a mousse with corn bread dish. The meal was incredible and truly a wonderful dining experience. We're glad we went and it's also in a cool neighborhood (reminded me a little of Williamsburg) if you're looking for a drink before. Lili.Co, thank you for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"When in Montreal this place is a must. My wife and I sat at chef's table and had a great evning with Adrian (chef) and hostess / server Sophie. While we didnt officially order the tasting menu, we ordered 6 different plates plus dessert. Food is created and well balanced.   Hard to say what our favorite was.The savory green pea creme brulee was amazing; the wild mushrooms, scallop and duck were all winners too.   Cool vibe and entire staff extremely friendly.   Put it on your list. We will be back in 2018."}
{"text":"A discovery ! The best restaurant, I went in Montreal last week. I loved the layout : we were sitting at the bar in front of the kitchen. Th chef was super friendly and the food amazing ! I will come bak"}
{"text":"Caught up with two amazing girl friends here and had such a great time. Everything from the food to the service to the atmosphere was perfect. We split a series of dishes (5 or 6 I think), which were all fantastic. My personal favs included the curried octopus, dumplings, sweet bread buns and oysters (tip ask for the hot sauce with the oysters - amazing!). I would go back in a heart beat! The only downside is it comes at a price, but it is certainly worth it for a nice night out with friends. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Just a spectacular brunch. Sat at bar. Watched the kitchen hum in amazement. Top notch."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in a while. We opted for a la carte vs tasting menu and shared several plates, mostly vegetarian.   What I loved was how each dish played with different textures, a feast for the senses.   We started with a natural orange wine, which was delicious if not a bit too peach nectar heavy.   We ordered the beets (amazing textures with beets prepared in different ways, with crunchy rice on top), potatoes, creme brûlée with peas (they did the sweetbreads on the side to appeal to veg and non-veg at our table - this was my favorite dish with the amazing creme brulee crunch in a savory dish), Jerusalem artichokes, and lamb.   My meat-eating husband admitted that the veggie dishes were the stars of the show.  Service was friendly and attentive. Lovely atmosphere. We ate at the bar right by the chef and loved watching everything being prepared with love and thoughtfulness."}
{"text":"Not good. Spent $300 on 4 people and barely served 4 carrots 4 raviolis and \"65 day dry aged rib eye that looked like the scraps from the butcher shop nothing but bone and fat. Meat took 45 minutes to cook was served rare and lacked flavor. Raviolis sucked. Carrots were awesome but just 4 of them. We had 3 drinks each and could barely catch the waiters attention all night"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely phenomenal It tasted like a five star restaurant, I'm a huge foodie and I travel the world and try new foods all the time this was definitely an amazing experience. The workers were very nice, food was super fresh, drinks were amazing, and the environment was very comfortable and relaxing. I also really enjoyed the fact that you are able to see the chefs cooking everyone's food and you can also see the drinks being made. I will definitely be coming back here for brunch!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing brunch at Lili.Co. The eggs Benedict were amazing! Served on a biscuit with pulled pork and a wonderful hollandaise. I mean does it get any more decadent ?!?   The entire menu is in French. The wait staff was more than helpful to translate for my mother and I. I would highly recommend you stopping here while visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"OUAIS ! des abats (des tripes) au menu d'un brunch !! J'aime ça :) Donc oui, j'ai mangé un ragoût de tripes à un brunch, en sauce tomate, avec des chips... et même que c'était super bon !!!! En plus de ça, dehors il faisait froid et ça ventait, dedans il faisait chaud et y'avait une ambiance chaleureuse. On voit les cuisiniers s'affairer, et moi j'aime bien ça voir les gens qui cuisinent pour moi. Me tarde mon prochain brunch là bas !!!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, friendly and knowledgeable staff. Went with two friends to catch up over the holidays, it was one of the few restaurants open. Started with fresh bread and oysters with a fiery and flavourful homemade hot sauce. Shared five plates, with some standouts being grilled octopus, ricotta dumplings and sweetbread buns. We were intrigued by the penis mapotofu but opted against it in the end.. Les beignets for dessert were delicious, slightly outshining a great pain perdu."}
{"text":"Tasting menu is what were were here for and what we got.  We also did the paired wines which introduced us to a number of small boutique producers.  This was cool as supporting and learning about small operations creating interesting wines is something we enjoy.   The tasting menu was good, but there were some lows as well as a really good high.  But that is sometimes what happens with this sort of situation and not everything is going to work for everyone.    Started off with stinging nettle and cured salmon.  This was very nice and refreshing for a start  The braised rhubarb was interesting and something I've never had cooked that way, so a neat idea.  Sweet Breads with zucchini and pickled fiddle heats were very nice and enjoyed that very much.  Really the best dish was the chicken livers (we think) with morels and chocolate.  This was such a cool thing and so excited to get morels for various reasons.  The main low for us though was a lobster and chanterelle dish were the lobster was just so over cooked and rubbery that it totally wrecked what else was going on.  But again, by the time you go here the menu will probably be different.  And I bet if I went on a different night that one dish would be different.  So yes I would go back.  One thing I wasn't crazy about is most of the seats in this place don't have backs, going for old dinner feel (who knows maybe this space used to be a lunch counter!), but didn't make for the most comfortable dinning, so if you have back issues keep that in mid when you are reserving a table."}
{"text":"This restaurant was on my list of must tries for a while and I'm so happy we tried it! We made a reservation for 3 people and when we got there, they had a spot waiting for us at the chef's bar. Everything from the service to the food was absolutely amazing. The chef gave us detailed descriptions of all of the items we ordered and of course enticed us to try more when we saw the dishes he was preparing for other tables. I would recommend going with a group so that you can try as many dishes on the menu as you can. The dishes are smaller, sharing style portions but truly delicious.  I believe that you get what you pay for. Yes, the bill was not cheap, but the quality of the food, the service and the atmosphere of the restaurant were all well worth it! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Après avoir goûté le brunch, découverte des plats du soir avec Montréal à Table :) Nous y allons avec enthousiasme et des attentes pour ce repas !  Pour les entrés : - Flanc de porc, salade de choux, beurre de cajou : une belle découverte d'association de saveurs entre le cajou et le flanc de porc!  - Champignons sauvages pochés au beurre, purée de chou-fleur caramélisé, chapelure de pain noir : une bonne portion de champignons sauvages, bien assaisonnés. Très bonne purée de choux-fleur caramélisés. Tout bon pour cette entrée.  Cela commence bien, est ce que cela va aussi bien suivre ?!?!  Pour les plats : - Gnocchi à la fajiole, fèves romano, tomates fumées, parmigiano : mmm rien de vaut de bons vrai gnocchis! La sauce est savoureuse, sur le moment j'aurais préféré en avoir plus, mais la quantité est quand même correcte.  - Pieuvre grillée laquée à l'hibiscus, chorizo, edamame, poudre d'olives noires, citron : miam miam miam. 2 bons morceaux de pieuvre avec des petits morceaux de chorizo qui vont à merveille tout comme les edamames. Un mélange entre du sucré, salé et épicé. Vraiment super plat avec des saveurs particulières, bravo au chef j'ai adoré :)  Le second service est donc à la hauteur de l'entrée, finissons avec la touche sucrée : - Beignets maison avec confiture d'airelles : bien pour finir avec des bonnes petites beignes. - Brioche avec boule de glace au miel et beurre de noix : TRÈS bonne glace! Vraiment! Le contraste de chaleur entre la glace et le beurre fait que le tout se mélange très bien et les saveurs s'en retrouvent multipliées!  Au niveau du service c'était un peu lent au début mais c'était le temps que cela se lance. Après rien à reprocher, beaucoup de réactivité pour l'eau, le pain et la présentation des plats.  Nous n'avons pas été déçu de revenir ici et on a autant aimé que la première fois que l'on était venus pour le brunch. Que cela soit un brunch ou un autre repas la qualité des plats est au rdv :) Je vous le conseille sans hésitation"}
{"text":"We snacked a bit, and the broccoli and the carrot dishes were both truly delicious. Creamy, bright, and amazing with the bread from Guillaume. The chef and the waiter were both super kind and helpful and it's my favourite to be able to sit and watch the kitchen work in a simple, sexy, tasteful room.   But I have to say, the food here is way too expensive. Montreal has gone a bit mad. To pay ~50$ and have one drink and still be hungry is... well, it's not an experience I'll seek to repeat soon."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite brunch places in town. The banana pancakes were fluffy. The added banana and the thick piece of bacon really elevated the flavour to a whole different level. It was perfect, sweet and salty!  We also got the Vietnam omelette, it was refreshing in contrast. The bean sprouts were crunchy, the omelette were tender, salmon and cilantro really brought out the freshness of everything in that dish.  My friend and I shared the two dishes. They were perfect balance to each other and we really enjoyed our meal.  P.s. They have an extensive selection of wine"}
{"text":"Best brunch !! The turmeric granola was excellent. Their two eggs sunny side up was delicious and that bacon yuummm ! I highly recommend this place for brunch. The environment is cozy and the servers are quite friendly."}
{"text":"Just wicked brunch. Big plates. Amazing cocktails. Friendly staff. Also menu was really interesting"}
{"text":"Chic, trendy spot to meet up with an old friend. The exposed brick on the outside is just plain cool along with the flower/eye logo splattered along the windows.  Love the outdoor sign. \"Fun\". Boo yeah.  The inside is gorgeous, calm, warm and inviting. We came on a Sunday for brunch (we made reservations but turned out we didn't need them). I was happy that it wasn't insanely busy. There are two horseshoe counters to sit at. Everything is out in the open, including the kitchen. Loved how one of the cooks was repping a Kazu t-shirt.  The menu is a short, one pager. Don't be afraid to ask for it in English or French, they have both! Waitresses here were incredibly sweet and attentive. I wanted to try three dishes for the two of us and while she said it was possible, we might die from a food coma. Something along those lines ;) She was spot on. The portions are extremely generous.  - Banana pancakes ($16.00) - bacon, dulce de leche butter, walnut and maple syrup. You get three stacks of pancakes. THREE. This was absolutely massive. The walnuts were like candied nuts. The pancakes were fantastic. Fluffiest pancakes I've ever had. You're palate will be dancing - sweet from the syrup and dulce de leche, salty from the bacon. Yum.  - Banh xeo ($19.00) - Nordic shrimps, scrambled eggs, shiitake, mint, cilantro and cashews. Obviously, I had to try their version of banh xeo (Vietnamese crepe). Great twist to a classic dish.  I'd return in a heartbeat. Would love to try their dinner next time."}
{"text":"Went to Lili.co on a Saturday night with two friends. I've been wanting to try this place for a while. The restaurant is cozy and has an industrial design touch. Their dinner menu consists mostly of tapas, there are maybe 15 of them ranging from vegetables to salmon and pork, we had 7 tapas for us 3 and they were all very good and original. The main ingredient in each one of them is simple but the accompaniment and sauces bring a lot of flavor to the dishes."}
{"text":"We visited this trendy little restaurant on St-Laurent for date night. The decor is warm and seating consists mostly of places around the bar or small tables on the side for groups of 4. They have an every changing market menu and serve up quite a few offal meats you'd have a hard time finding anywhere else. Given our ever unsatisfied curiosity, we opted to try all their weird organ dishes and were not disappointed! From head cheese to veal testicules and blood sausage, all the dishes were prepared to point and tasted like gourmet food you'd have a hard time believing ppl usually throw away.  My disappointment of the night was that I didn't get to try the dessert I wanted as they were sold out and nothing else on the menu looked as enticing. Also the service was a bit slow at the beginning as we had to wait quite a while to get wine service.   Overall, a great little place that I'd definitely return to for date night or with a small group of friends!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant, highly recommended. Friendly staff, great wine recommendations to pair with your food (should you opt out of the tasting+wine pairing option) and consistent. This marks my third visit btw,  Personal highlights - Aged steak (not the most tender, but flavorful).  - Apple tartelette - ORDER THIS TO START FOR ALL YOU FOIE LOVERS, seared foie gras on top!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went there while we were on a weekend get away, and we really enjoyed the food! The chef definitely likes to experiment, and we enjoyed it! If you are looking for very normal boring traditional meal, then this is not the place for you! We had the scallops ceviche to start, it was done very well. We had the pork chops and cauliflower as entrees - and both were excellent.  We got the foie gras for dessert - and oh my.....  I can't get enough of it!!!  Please, never take that off the menu!!!!  And the best part is, the meal is very reasonably priced for the creativity and quality!"}
{"text":"This place was incredible! My wife and I went here for our second dinner in Montréal and we were hoping to indulge in the tasting menu because there were both vegetarian and meat-eater options. However, we discovered that not only does everyone at the table have to partake in the tasting menu, but the menu option has to be the same as well. Since my wife is vegetarian and I am not, this wasn't going to work. Luckily, there was also al la carte ordering so we mixed and matched a variety of items. To start we had the house pickles and the sourdough bread, but of which were worthwhile. Next up was the blackened leeks and house made ricotta (super flavorful), the pickled turnips (my favorite!), and the gougéres (nicely fried). For our mains I got the duck breast, which was cooked perfectly, and my wife got the wild mushrooms. Finally, for dessert we elected to get the lime and coconut cake, which had just the perfect amount of sweetness.   Highlights: Super great sauces & our server's knowledge of wine. Misses: Wish you didn't have to commit to a single tasting menu when dining with a group."}
{"text":"First impressions, a timeline.  Pre-meal: trendy, in chic Le Plateau Mont Royal, easy reservation process through Bookenda  First peek: the weird double bar reminds me of a Benihana hibachi   First look at the menu: ooh la la, omnivore and vegetarian tastings!   First disappointment: everyone at the table has to have the same tasting menu? oh. then vegetarian, I guess... (I'm an unrepentant carnivore, but non-meat sacrifices must be made when dining w/ animal lovers)   First, second, third bites: 1. promising.... 2. (savory veggie green creme brulee gimmicky mushy peas thing)... pretty but more weird than good... at least they tried... 3. (blue cheese pakora thingie) yum!!! (but I miss meat)  Last bite: I'm sooooo fuuulllllll (but I must power through and finish this amazing beer ice cream dessert. I failed. Major food coma)   Weeks later, lasting impression: NATURAL WINE TO THE MAX!!!  Final determination: I'd come back, but next time I'm getting offal"}
{"text":"It's a lovely place! I ordered a banana pancake. It was bigger than I thought! The bacon was well cooked and the sweet-salty mixed taste was quite good."}
{"text":"Went here for the brunch. We ordered the banana pancakes and the Vietnamese crepe.  All items are beautiful to see and delicious. The Vietnamese crepe is supposed to come with shrimps, but I didn't see anyone. The scrambled egg was more like an omelet.  The piece of bacon on the banana pancakes was excellent.   The place was a little loud, with coffee machine, cook outside and music.  I'm a fan, I'll try to go back as their menu is often changing, and even if it's a bit pricey."}
{"text":"I was a loyal patron of Lili Co at the old location in Le Plateau and I was worried when I heard that they were moving to a bigger space. Well fear not my foodies, for the quality is exactly the same, the kitchen and bar are wide open and the food is still soooo good. The feeling of care and thought into every ingredient is still there and the cocktails are incredible (more room = more boozy options!) Best thing about this move? They now do lunch! The menu is always changing, but come for the brunch or dinner and arrive with a group so that you can try a bite of everything! The fish was cooked perfectly, the fiddleheads were divine and my partner's meat dish was fall off the bone, melt in your mouth good."}
{"text":"I've been to Lili.Co twice for brunch now. Excellent service and delicious and unique brunch dishes! My favourite dish is their Vietnamese crepe! They take online brunch reservations so you don't have to wait to be seated. My friend and I even stayed a while to chat and the waiter brought us 2 complementary banana beignets. A must try brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Chill little breakfast joint on The main. I love sitting at the bar to watch the cooks do their thing - however, don't like not having back support; it's just not comfortable. That being said, food was decent but nothing to rave about. I had the pancakes with the slab of bacon. You really can't mess up bacon."}
{"text":"There are so many restaurants in Montreal that I wish to check out but sadly I don't have enough time (or frankly money if we are being truthful). For the part 3 years, the October-November event of MTL à Table has allowed me to get to certain restaurants at a reduced price which I am very thankfully for. When I first looked at the restaurants participating this year, the one that leaped off the page for me was Lili Co. Originally a small Plateau restaurant, partners Catherine Draws and David Pellizzari moved into a bigger space on Saint-Laurent earlier this year. Reading the big reviews they have gotten over the past few years - including a most recent one in the Gazette in July - Lili Co.'s use of offal and off-cuts really intrigued me and had me pinning for a visit. Sadly, the MTL à Table menu didn't have any of that - unless you paid a little extra - but I still wanted to go and give them a try.  Visually, Lili Co. is a nice clean space. The main focus is on the two wrap-around bars which circle both the bar area and the open kitchen where you can watch Chef David and his crew do their work. In fact, outside of a few spots - including where we were sadly! - the entire room is set up to face the kitchen. Service was quick and efficient. Noise level was pretty loud given the room was full. As such, there was background music throughout the night but I honestly couldn't tell you what it was. It is not the most fancy room around but sharp nevertheless.  I felt like a cocktail this evening so I tried one of their seasonal specialities - The \"Sans nom d'automne\" - zubrowska, cachaca, natural apple juice, teapot bitters and star anise. I like this one in theory but the flavour left me indifferent. The sweetness of the cachaca and the apple juice were not noticeable. I was left primarily with the bitterness and the zubrowska - not really I had hoped for.  With the cocktail consumed, we moved on the food. First up was the pork belly served with cashew butter and creamy coleslaw. A generous peace of fatty pork with a nice crispiness to the skin. The creamy coleslaw paired well with the meat. The cashew butter was nice as well.  Our other starter was wild mushrooms poached in butter served with caramelized cauliflower purée and black bread crumbs. A simple dish but so well executed and delicious. The mushrooms were soften slightly with their wonderful earthiness intact. The real star though was the cauliflower puree - so rich and smooth. Very enjoyable.  Our second course started with Gnocchi à la fajiole served with romano beans, smoked tomatoes and parmigiana. A nice creamy sauce paired well with the pillowy gnocchi and the beans. Only complaint would be the portion size - definitely would have been nice to have a few extra gnocchi!  The second main was grilled octopus with a hibiscus glaze, chorizo, soy beans, black olive powder and lemon. The hit of the evening for us. The mixture of the glaze and the chorizo gave the tender octopus a hint of both sweetness and spiciness. The soy beans added a little extra sustenance to the plate. Definitely a dish I would order again.  For dessert, we were treated to house doughnuts with lemon mousse and huckleberry jam. The doughnuts were light and fluffy in the inside with a nice crunch on the outside. Add the sugar coating to the jam and the mousse and you have a nice dessert right there. The final dessert was a brioche with a nut beurre monté, sumac and a wild flower glace au miel. Just like the doughnuts, the brioche was nice and fluffy. The special touches of the beurre monté and the glace au miel provided some nice sweetness and richness.  I'll admit I was disappointed that no offal or off-cut dishes were present in the menu option - since that is what attracted me to Lili Co in the first place - but in the end, that is on me for having waiting until MTL à Table to finally visit Lili Co. The food was excellent and the atmosphere enjoyable - you can see why they needed to move into bigger digs this year. This meal simply reinforced that I will need to come back again. Looking forward to visiting chef David and Catherine on a more regular occasion.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is what a passion play looks like. Grab a seat at the counter, the one that wraps around the chef and his mis en place. Chat up the waitress who cheerfully brings you wine tastings and perfectly balanced cocktails. Order everything and a little bit more.  We had excellent food for sure, but more importantly were greeted with such good cheer, warmth and hospitality that I felt like, well there is no other way to say this, a princess. Where other chefs balk, this one and his team, invite you in and aim to please. We are difficult customers, with considerable food limitations, but we love to eat, drink, go out and see what the world has to offer.  Chef offered to tweak dishes on the spot and even to plan a special menu with 48 hours notice. Thank you Lili.co for making our visit a highlight of our trip to Montreal and a destination we hope to return to.  What we drank and ate: A Manhattan. Spumante - Italian Bubbles A dry white wine from New Zeland  Pickled Leeks  - but don't call them pickled. These are charred and caramelized and sauteed and transformed into perfumed little poems Broccolli with miso aioli - YES please! Wild mushrooms with raclette melted over a pile of veg., with some serious secret sauce Salad of fresh lettuces and radish Bread and butter Marlin, lightly seared, sliced over more saucey drips, with nasturtium leaves Sea parsley cake - oh my Millet cake with WOWberries and millet popped pieces  To end the night, chef brought out a red mushroom recently foraged for his kitchen, cooked it up in butter and shared the aroma with all of the guest at the counter.  Just go."}
