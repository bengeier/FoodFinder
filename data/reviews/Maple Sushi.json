{"text":"Great sushi spot in Vaughan/maple. We used to quite often when it was called Sakura but this was the first time we went under new management. Sushi is still great and different from other spots in the area. Definitely try the \"Out of control sushi\" it's great!  Price was a bit more than others in the area but definitely worth it. Also, great use of the ipad to order your meals."}
{"text":"The food was really gooood. Service was fast and the price was great for the amount of food we ate."}
{"text":"I love that more places are doing the Ipad ordering system, very convenient. Went here for lunch several times. Fresh fish. Awesome food. Fast. No complaints."}
{"text":"Broken glass inside mango pudding, probably from when the server slammed down the desserts. The expression on her face looked like we just murdered her family or something. When we brought it to their attention she didn't even say sorry, again same expression. The manager came and asked if my friend cut himself with the glass, when he found out nobody was hurt he was just in a hurry to leave. This place is a joke even by Asian service standards."}
{"text":"i had dinner here for the first time. ive been to other sushi restuarants with the ipad menu but this was the best so far. the service was really fast and the food couldnt be better. this is my sushi place from now on"}
{"text":"Maple Sushi is located in a small non discreet plaza. Don't let the small store front fool you. This location sports a large interior with many booths and 6 - 12 person tables. The staff are knowledgeable, prompt and friendly. 

The sushi and roll portions are unlike most all you can eat places. Here they ensure the ratio of rice to filling is to your advantage. The BBQ eel rolls I had were excellent and not packed full of rice. Their lunch menu is extensive. Whether you are a raw food lover or an izaka   fanatic, they will meet your every need. 

Order portions are per piece for most grilled/fried items. The sushi is done per piece as well. With the exception of rolls (green dragons com in 8 and BBQ eel is done in 6).

The plating and presentation is fantastic. Best I've seen for Ayce lunch places. Though the order is simple. You can see the effort and consistency. This place is not only worth trying for the food. But it brings a sense of revived respect toward the countless Ayce sushi places."}

Yo mandems even bless it up with free pop and they got cheese wontons too.  Blessup ting nice price 5/5"}
{"text":"Truly the biggest disappointment ever!! After a bad experience I said I would never go back.  Craving sushi and reading all the great reviews I thought I would give it a try once more; plus I heard there was a mgmt change.  What a mistake!!!

Order delivery and it was completely disgusting.  We ended up throwing the food away and eatting a bag of chips.  Not sure if the driver didn't have AC but the sushi was warm.  When we opened the package it didn't smell good either.  And the shaved turnip that the fish sits on was brown and watery.  The fish tasted funny and I feel like I am about to throw up.

Not only was my meal a complete waste of money, I think I am about to be really sick!!"}
{"text":"Customer service was alright.But food was REALLY great! Selection was great too (including ramen, appetizer). We came because of the positive rating, which we definitely made the right choice of!"}
{"text":"Good AYCE sushi and good price. One of the better Japanese AYCE places in north GTA. I've meant to write this review for a while since we've been going to this place for years. We're quite picky about our sushi joints and have been to the worst . The sushi is quite good, though there is no tuna (at least not that we recall). Good standards on the AYCE menu like Mackerel, Roe, Eel, butterfish, red snapper, and Salmon. Dinner comes with these in sashimi. We also always get the Negimaki (beef strips rolled with green onions or mushrooms on the inside) - very good. The Tempura, is pretty good and we usually have the assorted veggies and the shrimp. The beef short ribs (Kalbi) is also decent. No beef sashimi here, unfortunately. This is an all-round dependable place. They also have a loyalty card which you can earn free meals with."}
{"text":"I often take in the all you can eat lunch menu. This restaurant offers great value and speedy service. The only issue for me is the spicy salmon and tuna rolls. The spicy sauce taste like tabasco sauce..yuck!"}
{"text":"I tried the lunch AYCE and can say it is great value for fresh fish and the fast service! They offer an Ipad for ordering to make it simple and more efficient. It also ensures that everything the customer orders is included.

I love the shrimp tempura! The batter was a slightly thick but it was tasty the right way!  The rolls were also full of fish and complementary taste of the other ingredients in the roll.
The sushi included seafood that were fresh!
Hot dishes are also very good!

Softdrinks and iced tea are also included. It is rare for AYCE to be AYCD as well!"}
{"text":"The place was crowded on Friday night, and looking at 5 Star review I expected more. Rolls are adequate for all you can eat. The reason for 3 stars are the flies in the restaurant"}
{"text":"Good food, decent service, inexpensive, fresh"}
{"text":"Worst experience at an AYCE ever.

First of all, let me start off by saying that I've been to this restaurant over 5 times in the past and ever since they changed ownership, this place has gone down in quality and customer service. 

My fiance and I were both there for lunch and ordered a few fried items and a few rolls for us to share. As soon as we received the California rolls, we noticed that there was barely any crab meat (practically a sliver of a normal sized crab stick) and the amount of rice on these rolls made it seem as if this place was trying to fill you up on rice. 

When we were ready to pay, the owner asked us if we were going to finish everything, to which we replied no. (There were only 7 rolls left over, 5 California rolls which my fiance refused to eat because of their quality and 2 spicy salmon rolls that I simply could not finish). The owner than said that we had to pay for everything that was left over. I have been to many AYCE sushi places in the past and never was this enforced over 7 rolls. Tricking your customers by placing your policy in small tiny writing at the bottom of an ipad DOES NOT MEAN I HAVE ACCEPTED YOUR POLICY. 

The owner proceeded to argue with us over the fact that we needed to pay for the small amount of rolls that were left over. This was UNPROFESSIONAL AND DISGUSTING BEHAVIOR. 

It got so bad that by the end of it we just wanted to leave and never come back to this place ever again. We asked how much he wanted and he replied $7. We paid it and left no tip. 

Let me also be clear, this was not our first time at an AYCE and never have we experience such horrible treatment by the owner of a restaurant. I've left 5-6 pcs of rolls at other restaurants and never have I been yelled at about wasting food and been forced to pay a measly $7. 

Do yourself a favor and spare yourself the horrible treatment and terrible food and go to another AYCE where you will not be treated like garbage. 

I would recommend either Makimono or Kiku as MUCH BETTER OPTIONS.

DO NOT be swayed by previous reviews... This place is now under new ownership and is no longer the same as it was before."}
{"text":"I've had good service all the time.. They bring your food out quickly. Havent missed any order so far."}
{"text":"I went here today for their all you can eat lunch. They don't have many options besides the basic sushi, rice and tempura dish. The service was okay but I found it completely rude when the servers speak in their language (obviously talking bad) since we could not eat one sushi that was left. The food quality was not the greatest. It didn't taste fresh. Their restaurant was set up really nice. I would not go back here."}
{"text":"I eat here and order delivery because of the food but the staff/waitress is rude especially the one who always answer the phone and not pleasant at all when serving."}
{"text":"SUPER IMPRESSED! This place is actually GOOOOOOD. I, so badly want to give this 5 stars - but can't, because their servers that night were terrible and literally stood at the table beside us just gossiped the whole night. 
Seriously? It was only the manager/owner that was serving the whole restaurant, majority of the time. 

Let me just say however; $21.99 for dinner AYCE (it was a Tuesday) INCLUDING drinks. Aww yeahhhh. 

Pros:
- sashimi was FRESH
- their tataki was not too thick and perfectly salmon
- albacore tuna on the menu (seriously? At this price?)
- cooked foods were great, not too greasy 
- black sesame icecream!!!!
- the rolls were sooo good; HUGE but perfectly proportioned rice 
- the eel fried rice had GIANT chunks of eel in it; much better than what you'd usually get st a place like Congee Wong
- unlimited soft drinks and tea 

The not so great:
-their servers; chatty amongst themselves, presented themselves as unimpressed the whole night
They literally just come up to your table, stare, puts the plate down, and return to gossiping about their personal lives. .....uh, thanks for the service? I think?

DEFINITELY try the out-of-control roll. 

For a restaurant that is slightly hidden, and certainly not aesthetically pleasing on the outside , they've got a lot of patrons. 
The place filled up during our visit (early dinner hours too), with a never ending flow of takeout orders. 

We were pretty upset with ourselves, for not having discovered this place, until now. 

No doubts, we will be back."}
{"text":"This place is okay, you order everything through an iPad, but I feel that the selection is sort of limited. The servers are really friendly however, the catch if you don't finish is with every all you can place which is you have to pay a fee. Overall I felt that it is a solid 3 star rating for the food and service combined."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best sushi all you can eat restaurant in Aurora. Fast Service and always Fresh. Staff listens to you and your needs. Try it out."}
{"text":"Great service and great options for food. Always enjoyed coming here ever since I was a university student"}
{"text":"Far exceeded our expectations for this AYCE restaurant. I always rant about poor service in Chinapanese restaurants, so I was absolutely delighted to see we could self order from iPads. Very smart. The service was prompt and the food, very good and presentation, actually quite decent. Included are soft drinks and a decent selection of desserts. For couple diners, the maki rolls are of larger serving. The mango pudding is one of the best I have sampled."}
{"text":"No complaints whatsoever. Food was good, service excellent, atmosphere was relaxed. All you can ask from an AYCE. 
Worth the visit just for the \"out if control \" roll. Love the iPad ordering which is starting to become popular. Sashimi is extremely fresh which is key in these types of places."}
{"text":"I've been to Maple Sushi many times and have always had an average experience. The rolls are pretty good but I'm seriously put off by the fact that they use canned tuna for their white tuna hand rolls. Who are you fooling though...? How do you think that people are not going to notice that? Also, the fact that they have such a limited selection for lunch is kind of annoying (e.g. they don't even have basics like seaweed salad or spicy tuna/spicy salmon sushi). I've heard good things about their dinner menu so maybe my mind will change once I try that but for now... this place is like any other sushi place in Woodbridge. I'd personally save my money and go somewhere nicer like ichiki."}
{"text":"Love this place food always tastes amazing very fresh and the sushi pieces are very generous big pieces. Usually like to dine there but today I did takeout and they forgot the salads that come with my lunch order and spicy mayo so I'll give them a four but food is still great."}
{"text":"I love this place. Really great quality sushi for an all-you-can-eat place. Too bad they don't deliver to my location, otherwise would order for every get-together."}
{"text":"We always order the party tray for takeout. It has a huge portion and at a great price. Quality is decent with that kind of price. Eat in is decent. There's are a nice number of buffet choices and fast service. Only thing that can be improved is the lighting and decor. It always feels a bit dim and on the dirtier side."}
{"text":"iPad ordering service. Service was ok. AYCE was good priced. Selection was good for lunch selection."}
{"text":"Food- The quality of the food definitely went down. I felt like everything was too saucy or just didn't taste right. My recommendations would be to go to Ichiki or Kuu. 

Ambiance- It was clean and there was plenty of space.

Service- Pretty Average

Value- The value is still pretty good for an ACYE sushi"}
{"text":"We came here for their AYCE lunch and as usual I ordered plenty of avocado rolls. Avocado was fresh and rolls were delicious. Place is clean and spacious. Comfy booths. Order via tablet. Friendly service.

Complimentary fountain drink upon checking in."}
{"text":"I really love it here. The food is great and the service isn't bad. I love their beef. There good chefs. I don't think it's bad here and I've been here like 12 times."}
{"text":"I've been to Maple Sushi twice with my girlfriend, formerly Sake Sushi, and I can say it is a very stellar sushi spot tucked into the town of Maple. The decor is nice and it is comfortable, with a good vibe throughout. Ambient L.E.D. lighting lines the dining floor, and a soothing instrumentals of R&B with an Asian inspiration provide the diners with an easy listening experience.


Food is great and not very greasy, as well as prepared promptly and fresh. Ordering on iPads adds to the experience, and there is a great amount of options to choose from. The sushi here is amazing. Try the Out of Control roll and thank me later. Price is decent, about 19 for weekday dinner and 25 for weekend. 

Service is also not bad. Not great but the staff there are generally pleasant. Definitely recommend to my peers and anyone interested in a great AYCE sushi experience."}
{"text":"Came here for AYCE buffet. You order via tablet. Plenty to choose from. Basic fountain drinks are free. Alcoholic drinks are available at extra cost. Their avocado options are delicious. Place is spacious, modern, and clean. Booths are comfy.

Overall another AYCE sushi restaurant but on the fancier side. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Food was just ok.  Love the iPad ordering.  Service was ok.  Overall it was just ok.  Not good, not bad.  Not sure I would return.  So many other all you can eat sushi places that are way better then Maple Sushi"}
{"text":"Visited for a birthday celebration. 8 people. Made reservations for 8 @ 6pm no one was in the restaurant but within 30 minutes it was packed. The restaurant has about 40 tables. It was clean but it was rainy and the floor was slippery. Watch yourself! I saw two people fall as they were leaving with their takeout! The service was ok. Servers were nice and hated refills on drinks. There was 3 servers a manager and two chefs making sushi. 

We got all our food prompt and quickly, but they could not keep up with how quickly the restaurant filled and couldn't not keep up with the orders from other tables. I saw a couple tables freak out after waiting 30 minutes for anything. They were working so far but could not keep up with the volume. I would assume one or two employees did not show up for work? To top it off the most annoyed guy in the restaurant fell as he got up to talk to the manger which made him more mad. 

The food was great! Very well presented and not tossed onto a plate like most sushi places. The sashimi was cut nicely and the perfect temperature. Best seaweed salad I've had! They did not use a ton of sesame oil like most places do!! Bonus :) the rolls were well done and not filled with mayo !! The tempura was hot and not soggy.  I enjoyed the side dishes too, rice, udon, it was all served fresh and tasted good. Better than some sushi places I go to regularly and cheaper.  

At the end, our bills came and they put a tip for service on the bill - however for two guests the tip on the bill is $6.... Weird they must have trouble with people not tipping! Maybe because of location but I would hope no one tips less than $6 on a $50 bill."}
{"text":"Was in the area and stopped by here for lunch! Wasn't sure about the previous reviews but I gotta say this place is a hidden gem! Was greeted right away once we got to the door! All you can eat lunch for such a great value! You also get a free soft drink as well! A lot of different varieties! The fried rice is super good! Pineapples are fresh! Great selection! The best thing is my toddler ate for free! He's only 2! He's picky but such a great place! Servers were nice as well! You order through the tablet! Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Good value and a reasonable amount of selection.  Not the biggest menu but enough of the favorites to cover most tastes.  The party platters are a favorite.  It looks like that's the only way to get special rolls to go.  Don't think there is a place with better value.  Rolls are pretty big and the Sashimi  is cut pretty thick... not like others that slice thin or have a tiny cross section.  If they keep this formula up I'll definitely keep ordering from here.  IT won't be the best sushi you have ever had but that's not what they are trying to be... they are a go to place that you can hit a couple times a week and it won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Very disappointed , service was terrible . Our waitress was miserable . No one came and cleared our table , we had empty dishes everywhere had no room for any more food on the table .Every chicken platter we ordered was extremely Raw . Food was nothing special , and service was terrible . Would never come back"}
{"text":"Let me make it clear. The only reason I'm even here is because Sen sushi down the street ($10.99 AYCE lunch) is closed on Mondays. Service is terrible here. The servers come around and throw things onto your table without making eye contact or even reacting at all when we say thank you.

Selection of rolls is average. Some interesting looking signature rolls.

Interior seems cute at first with all the colour changing LEDs everywhere and using iPads to order is fun, but why are there Valentine's day decorations everywhere? It's November! Not today, Satan.

Food is actually pretty good. It'll do if you just want a quick lunch. Presentation of appetizers is nice with everything coming on nice white sets, I attached a pic of our salads. The avocado wasn't ripe in our rolls though :( my previous review was 5 stars because we got delivery and the food was good, and we didn't have a chance to experience the service.

Overall I will not be returning unless I don't have other choices. The place has potential but the service is so bad, and there is so much competition these days that they really need to step it up if they want returning customers. I personally have so many other choices of places to go to, and next time I will choose to go to another sushi bar in the area."}
{"text":"These AYCE joints are a disaster. Why do people think that if a place offers you all you can eat you're going to receive anything of any quality. 
Watery sashimi, big ricey rolls.. have at it people!"}
{"text":"Went around an hour before closing time, servers are rude, and they started mopping and closing up with half an hour before they close. Place smelt nasty because of the mop and lost appetite."}
{"text":"The first time i went here, it was fine. Nothing to rave about but pretty decent and the all you can eat deal was good. We went at supper time and the place was pretty busy. But the second time i went it was at lunch time and the experience was awful! The waitress was rude, and took forever to get our menus.

 But truthfully the main reason i will no longer go there ever again was because of the GROSS behavior of the cooks behind the counter. They have a sushi bar that is in the main room ( like most sushi places, sushi bar in front, kitchen in back). The guy preparing the sushi was spitting into the garbage can right next to the open food plates. He also blew his nose very loudly into a tissue and didn't wash his hands at all after! So after all that sniffling and snorting over the food, my family and i left without ordering. 

Honest to goodness guys, i think i have only walk out of a restaurant once before in my life. But we just really couldn't stay :( 
ew ew ew ew"}
{"text":"I went here the first time it opened and it was really nice. They've changed the menu a little bit and it kinda disappointed me however they still have nice options on the menu."}
{"text":"Pretty good for an AYCE, a solid 3.5 but since you can't dish out half points, rounded up to 4 due to fast efficient service and fair price.The menu has enough variety to keep most people busy. Basic pops are also included which is very nice considering most places charge for that.

Ordering from the iPad was very easy and straight forward. Our entire order was delivered with 100% accuracy and pretty quickly even as restaurant was around 40% full. Servers were quick to clear plates so we were very happy with the service aspect."}
{"text":"After the rave reviews I expected a veritable palace of sushi heaven and was surprised to find this location in a nondescript strip mall in Vaughan.  It was after 2 and the location was almost empty.  It is a decent-sized space but the lighting made it dismal.  The server motioned me toward a booth, gave me the tablet ordering system and I went to town.

One thing I noticed immediately is that the portions are more generous than other sushi places' AYCE offerings.  The Out of Control Roll was especially giant.  Their selection of rolls was quite creative and all were well-constructed.  It really turned out to be some of the better sushi I've had in the area.

The service was adequately prompt but a bit expressionless and carried the air that they wish they were anywhere but there.  Not that I expect ecstatic shrieks and back rubs when I arrive somewhere, but it would be nice to see a smile, perhaps a cheerful hello, anything but the soulless eyes of the walking dead.  That coupled with the dingy, underlit interior made me in perhaps more of a hurry to escape than I'd have otherwise been."}
{"text":"1. Good service, kept taking up our dirty plates right away when we leave them in the edge of the table 

2. You order your food/drinks with iPad

3. Spacious dinning area & I like their booths it has privacy 

4. Sushi/rolls always taste fresh & cold never warm 

5. I like that they had deep fried tentacles 

6. Like how they added creativity to their plates. For  example I ordered beef, chicken, and shrimp on skewers and it came stuck in an orange 

7. They need to add deep fried banana to their menu so I can eat it with my red bean and strawberry ice cream lol"}
{"text":"The quality has gone down a lot. The rolls were soggy and they charge for spicy mayo which is in the tiniest container. 
The service is terrible. The lady at the cash is so rude and acts like she's doing you a favour when you go to pay or ask any questions. I was told that Maple Sushi is Halal, when I went there the first time I asked and the waiter told me it was. When i went back a few weeks later I was told its not halal. This is unacceptable, the food was great at one point but now I know never to return. The attitude of the workers has an impact on someone going back and i simply wont be returning. Aroowha Sushi, is not too far away and is definitely the best option."}
{"text":"Just had the worst experience . We came about an hour before close. We were told it was last call for all you could eat , asked for our iPad to order . We were watched from the moment we sat. We ordered and again were told last call , this time at 10:15pm. 5 minutes later were again told it was last call, before our food even came . Got our food and yet again was told kitchen closing, last call. At 10pm, while eating we were asked to pay our bill as they were closing the cash. I told them we were eating and how rude it was and that we have been rushed since we walked in the door and what a poor experience this has been , being nagged every 5 minutes.  She walked away . 
Now 10:15, still eating, she brought our bill and the staff were milling around us like bees, the cooks were out of kitchen and sushi area clean.beumg we were eating , no dessert was offered.  They started washing the floor with a bucket and mop 5 feet away. They came to get our dishes and I said we were finished, cannot eat when someone is draining dirty water in a bucket near our table. Disgusting! 
The staff watched us as we opened our fortune cookies. We took our time but knew they wanted us out. I went to pay and said we should get a discount for the horrible experience. Nothing was said. I paid by debit and left. They locked the door , turned off the lights. 
Never have experienced this. Ever! They close at 10:30, and everyone was gone. 
Never going back . That is not how you treat customers. Rude !
Horrible new management, food not as good. 
Worth the drive back midtown  to our friends at Maki . Miss the great food, service and personable owner who always treats us great."}
{"text":"I literally Yelped \"AYCE Sushi\" I'm Vaughan and picked one randomly which ended up to be Maple Sushi. 

The plaza itself was really dark and I almost ran over a curb because I couldn't see and it took me a second to locate the restaurant.

This place runs on an iPad ordering system and you can literally do everything on the iPad, from splitting your bills and getting the wifi password which I thought was very convenient! Another great thing was the pop was free and refillable, a lot of AYCE charges for pop. The selection was huge but typical sushi selections. One roll that stood out to me was the \"Angry Roll\", it's a deep fried roll with a bunch of stuff in it and topped with spicy crab meat. It was pretty good even though the presentation isn't the best! 

The one thing I wasn't a big fan of was the cream cheese wonton. The cream cheese looked like it came straight from the freezer and didn't even have the consistency of cream cheese, I ended up only eating the shell..

Overall, great place to go. Affordable and clean!
Weekend AYCE dinner price: $26.99"}
{"text":"Maple Sushi is priced at 13.99 for lunch and 21.99 for dinner (Monday - Thursday) for adults. Pretty regular for an AYCE restaurant, but it's definitely got much more to it than most places I've been to. 

It's actually located where Sakura Sushi used to be with new owners, employees, and menus. I think it is 100% better than what it used to be. There is a greater selection to choose from, the rolls are done very nicely, and the sashimi tastes fresh! I love it here, and this is coming from someone who lives in the area and has pretty much been to every sushi restaurant in Maple. 

Out of Control rolls are definitely one of the unique items that you need to try! I also enjoy the BBQ Pork Ramen. Everything else is pretty tasty too. I don't really have any complaints about the food.

Overall, I'd recommend this place to anyone who's in the area and looking for a decent AYCE sushi restaurant. The service is great, although at times a bit slow. But hey, comparing it to most places I've been to in Maple, it always has a lot of tables filled up so it's understandable why it may be a bit slower. Nonetheless, still one of my favourite places! The iPads for ordering are super neat as well!!"}
{"text":"Really bad service. The food takes forever to come out. The food isn't that good. Nothing like what the reviews say."}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant for the first time for lunch AYCE, food was good with a decent selection of rolls, grilled foods and others.  It's also pretty neat to be able to order by iPAD, and services was good.  Food was a little on the salty side, and they did forget some of our orders.  Shrimp yakitori and the chicken karage (like popcorn chicken and still moist inside? are recommended.

Compared to other sushi AYCE in the Woodbridge area, this place costs couple bucks more.  Definitely will consider coming back on occasions, but still prefer to stick with my usual go to place."}
{"text":"I loved every thing I saw I ordered 27 things they all were amazing  it's great for kids there's colour full lights and they show you how they make there rolls  hope you go there"}
{"text":"I honestly wanted to write a decent review, but I just cannot bring myself to like this place. Been there a few times, because my wife and her friends love it. Had a few takeouts, because again, my wife loves it.

I don't. The ingredients are typical AYCE, if not below grade, and just thinking about their food gives me a dry mouth.

If you are into AYCE, then they are a decent competitor to Kuu, which is close by. If you are not - look for a normal sushi joint - there aren't any in the area, ever since Momoyama closed down."}
{"text":"I ordered Ubereats from here once. If I recall correctly, I had the salmon bento. Portions were very generous and food was well made. Nothing spectacular about the bento (it's just salmon bento) but my dinner filled me up and was delicious."}
{"text":"Must try this place!!!

Their staff can be a little forgetful when you ask for a spoon/fork or spicy mayo but their sushi and kitchen food definitely make up for that!

Fish is very fresh, best I've ever had. They have a few different things you should definitely try on their menu. Kani salad is definitely one of those things.. Absolutely in love with it. I never leave without having at least 2 of those.

It's a little pricy for dinner but for an ayce place with their quality of food.. I'd say it's worth it 100%!!!"}
{"text":"Convinced my son to try a different sushi place and this place was highly recommended. Miso soup was lukewarm. Sushi was just bland. Spider roll was lacking the crab. Staff was super rude and not very attentive, had to ask for new sheets and for them to clear the dishes. Rather stick to other spots than return here"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a couple of coworkers today. Terrible service and it wasn't even that busy! Not ideal for those with limited time for lunch.

1) We were a party of 3, the waitress sat us down at a table with 2 place settings and didn't come back with another setting. We had to ask 3x before someone finally brought us the extra set.

2) No one came by to fill our tea cups. We asked 2 servers, none of them came back so we ordered via their tablet and that even took forever to come!

3) Our food came out slow.

4) We were all paying with credit. The waitress punched in the machine for my one coworker then walked away. We waited and waited and still no one came back and we were now at 2hrs into our lunch time and had to get back to work so we ended up punching in the rest of the transactions ourselves!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, service was pretty cold. Had to flag a server down each time we wanted something."}
{"text":"This place is extremely overrated. The customer service is atrocious. My friend had to leave to the hospital because he wasn't feeling well - he didn't have anything to eat, and when we proceeded to tell the waiter, he mentioned that does not matter and the full dinner price must be paid in a very rude tone. We kept mentioning that he didn't have a single roll, and the waiters response was \"that's not my problem, I don't know what happened to him, he's paying the full dinner price\". I hope people read this and take action to never step a foot in there. 

NEVER AGAIN. DISGRACEFUL."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for lunch yesterday , we have gone at least 6+ times since last year.
It WAS one of our favourite sushi places until yesterday we encountered the worst customer service I've ever had at a Sushi restaurant before. 
My spicy crab roll was absolutely disgusting filled with WAY too much crab and it wasn't spicy at all
We needed drink refills and every time they walk by they would ignore our \"excuse me\"
I even requested that our server come to the table from the iPad and they didn't come for another 10-15 mins 
Trying to get our bill was another hassle 
And keep in mind there was about 3 other tables, it wasn't busy! 

Honestly I won't be going back, I didn't enjoy myself. And to pay 60$ I'd much rather go to Akita or Sake and know I'll get proper food/service"}
{"text":"Went on a weekday afternoon during prime lunch hour but it was strange to find it so empty. Like others mentioned, interior decor is nice and clean. Very spacious and I can see seating large groups won't be an issue. 
The iPad is definitely a nice touch (almost reminds us of a chain in Tokyo!)
Since lunch does not offer sashimi, we were quite happy with the selection of sushi, rolls and hand cones. The tempura was perfectly light and crispy. The orders were good sized. The sushi are on the small side but I'm starting to noticed it's everywhere that does AYCE. 
The only need improvement I would say is don't use canned tuna in the spicy tuna hand cone - major turnoff! I understand the picture in the iPad menu may not match actual items but seriously...canned tuna?! 
That's the only thing I would avoid ordering."}
{"text":"Drivin by this place a thousand times and finally tried it and it was pretty yummy. Must try is the our of control role it's truly out of control."}
{"text":"I was actually SOOOOO surprised last time we were here! This place used to be a totally different sushi restaurant about 5ish years ago. When I used to work at wonderland I came here and this place just wasn't good at all. When they changed the name I hadn't heard much different and I moved on to other sushi places. But damnnnnnn was I surprised! Our best friends frequent this place and we were skeptical but we enjoyed ourselves so much. Best thing is their coconut shrimp with their honey mustard sauce. They should serve that sauce on the side of sushi So good! Secondly, I have a love for squid that no one else can imagine, mostly fried squid tentacles  and I've NEVER seen a sushi place have them at all!!! Usually dim sum places and a rare pho place. Sushi and sashimi was sooooooo fresh and service was great as well. I was having such a hard time with sushi places in Vaughan lately and this place is now one of my favourites."}
{"text":"Ordered Maple Sushi on UberEats. I got the Sushi Sashimi tray (with Maple roll, Crab roll, spicy salmon roll and an alaskan roll). The fish was fairly fresh and everything tasted pretty good overall. I'd love to try out their AYCE sometime."}
{"text":"In a nutshell, it's a decent spot delivering excellent value for food of solid quality, mired only by an extremely slow kitchen and atrocious taste in decor. Despite this, I'd say it's one of the better AYCE places in Vaughan. For more details, read on...

Food: 4/5
Sashimi cuts are fresh and served on a bed of ice. The portions are also fairly large, sometime to their detriment (salmon cuts seemed to be a bit too thick), and at times the sashimi was a touch to cool. Maki rolls were quite good, not too much rice, and they had a variety of special rolls available. Cooked food was really good as well. Dessert options are a bit limited, but they have some sesame-flavoured stuff. Oh, and soft drinks are included too.

Service: 3/5
It's really a mixed bag here. You use the iPad ordering system so interaction with servers is minimal (I don't really understand the phenomenon behind the explosion of the popularity of iPads at AYCE places). Servers are responsive enough but there's nothing particularly outstanding about the service. The kitchen is REALLY SLOW. By that, I mean the cooked food kitchen. The sushi makers are rolling stuff out within a reasonable time frame but we waited a whole HOUR for the cooked food to arrive. A table next to us waited just as long and just got fed up.

Value: 5/5
Excellent value given the generous portions and quality of food. The price is a touch lower than most other comparable AYCE places in the area.

Decor: 1/5
The place looks like some dingy former night club or lounge that was repurposed into a Japanese AYCE place. Everything is dark coloured trying to go for a modern, contemporary look, but the lighting is so off. I don't know how to characterize it, but it looks like some of those crappy stores in Vaughan Mills. This is not a place to take a date if you're looking for some romantic ambience."}
{"text":"The place looks a little bit old, not too much comfortable, but it's clean.
The employees are ok, they are not rude but not that kind too. Just do what they need in the faster way, not looking to serve you better.
The quality of most of the food is good, I really liked, just the fish that I found its not fresh.
The price is good, cheap, compared with another restaurants in the same quality.
If you are looking to a place to just eat, it's good. But if you are looking to a real nice Japanese all you can eat, it's not the place."}
{"text":"Both, the service and food here are garbage. 

The waitress was very rude, I ordered a veggie sushi pizza here, specifically stating that I didn't want sauce drizzled on top, and she agreed. When she delivered the item to our table, I saw sauce on my pizza and reminded her that I did not want sauce. She glared at me and told me I only said \"no spicy mayo\". I told her no, I said no sauce in general (there was wasabi mayo sauce on the pizza). She got angry, grabbed the plate and walked away. She didn't even replace my pizza.

The sushi rolls here are bulky with rice with very little topping. The miso soup was disgusting - tasted nothing like a miso soup, and the menu is very limited. 

The servers here hardly even greets you when you enter the restaurant. This is my second time dining here, and both experiences were disappointing. This sushi franchise has a cheaper AYCE price than most competing sushi AYCE restaurants... having said that, with the service and food you get here - definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Used to be one of my all time favourite sushi places. The walnut shrimp was to die for and the food was always fresh and top notch.

This restaurant used to have a lovely manager, Peter, who was so hardworking and concerned with guests leaving pleased. When they switched over to the new management, things kind of went downhill. I went once or twice after they changed management but had an issue both times and had to speak to the manager both times. The new manager was so unprofessional and seemed more like a boss than a leader toward his staff. Not to mention he spoke absolutely no English- huge issue. I have stopped going for sushi altogether and I really hope Maple can figure it out."}
{"text":"We came at 12:30 had to order 3 times because our order kept  being erased. Had the tablet replaced too because it *crashes* and still nothing. Not going there again.
Thanks for the tea though."}
{"text":"Previously known as Sakura Sushi, Maple Sushi has stepped up their game with new management, new ordering system and new menu items. Although I was a fan of Sakura to the bitter end, I do have to say they were in need of a pick me up. 

Maple Sushi kept the same great interior décor and gave their servers and menu a face lift (not literally). I really like that the new take out menu has better options for lunch specials while keeping the same amazing price. You can get any one roll + 9 sashimi pieces, soup & salad for $10! That's less than a buck per sashimi piece!

I've dined here recently and enjoyed the iPad experience. The service was prompt and friendly and the food tasted great. Just be warned they love to use their sauce and the prices increase for Friday and weekend dining. 

For take out on two separate occasions, I've ordered the salmon sashimi and spicy crunchy salmon roll, and again salmon sashimi and Alaska roll. The Alaska roll is salmon & avocado. Both times the price came out to a little under $9 with tax included. I knew ordering the spicy crunchy salmon roll for take out would be a mistake because it's nearly impossible to get home without it being saugy so I asked for that one. But the Alaska roll is good and the sashimi sizes are fairly meaty. I was a bit disappointed that I couldn't customize a roll (salmon, avocado and cucumber) but I got over it. See photo for reference.

Overall, I like this sushi joint and will continue to give them my business."}
{"text":"I just moved around the area and im a big time sushi fan! 
I tried a few places around and did not find the menu selection and/or quality I prefer.
I did delivery to test them out. They deliver for free if you order $25+ before tax and you get your food within an hour.
The sashimi was fresh and tasty! They had a great selection IMO. 
I also ordered the out of control special roll and it was very filling and delicious. 
The presentation of the sashimi and rolls I ordered was done very well.
I was also satisfied with the customer service. 
I will be coming back for a dine in experience."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite sushi restaurants in Vaughan. The prices are on par with other sushi restaurants and the food is great! The desert menu is a bit in the short side but they don't charge for pop and the food is great. No complaints would recommend."}
{"text":"I'm a pretty easygoing diner. I've never bothered doing a review, but there are soooo many AYCE sushi places in Newmarket and Aurora! If you want to narrow down your choices, and you care about service, you can knock Maple off your list.  Sushi is the same or better at just about any other place. Too much rice to sushi ratio and the older female server who's ALWAYS there is either rude or indifferent. We were regulars because it was nearby, clean and has a loyalty card, but when grumpsters reemed on my husband because he didn't eat all the rice with his sushi, we were done. There's just too many better options. We've since gone back to the waaaaaay better sushi and service at Sushi Itto (same price) though super casual. If you're looking for a place that's nicer inside, sushi den is a good option, a bit dark. Have tried 11 other sushi places in Aurora/Newmarket - maple would rank 9 or 10 out of those.  Sayonara maple!!!"}
{"text":"No quams with this AYCE sushi joint. The Ipad ordering system is very convenient and the service is pretty good, especially for AYCE sushi. The restaurant itself is large, clean and well-decorated and I was actually impressed with the food presentation. It'ls a specific style of sushi that you need to be in the mood for. A lot of spicy mayo and flavorful sauces do a lot of disguising, and heavy garlic and onion usage in the cooked food. Everything was pretty fresh, kind of just a flavor overload. I noted the quality and size of their sashimi to be better than most AYCE places I've been to."}
{"text":"Stopped by for supper based on the favourable previous review. Food was good, service was prompt, fairly tidy for post dinner rush at an all you can eat...

....but 'somehow' my credit card was skimmed here. Sucks when you go out for a meal and someone try's to buy jewellery the next day in the US online . Card company called and alerted me.  I got the card locked off but stuck me without my credit card on my vacation. It was the only time I used that card in over a week..."}
{"text":"Currently the Best All You Can Eat Sushi in town! 
They are a little lacking in the soup selection but everything else is absolutely delicious. Very unique specialty rolls are very good, very hard to stop eating :)"}
{"text":"Went a few weeks ago to this place for some sushi. I actually really enjoyed the food, they had a lot of selection and the price wasnt that bad considering the surrounding area is a bit pricey for restaurants. Its right near my college (Seneca) so it was a quick drive over, perfect for lunches between classes or after. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Apparently there is a points card system, however it's not worth it since a free all you can eat lunch is around 15,000 points or something like that. So you would have to eat there almost every day for it to be worth the card. And besides I dont even live in the area, only go there when I'm at school. However if you do live in that area def a restaurant to check out!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous.
I went to Maple sushi for a get together dinner with 10 friends. However, 4 of the people didn't eat any food. When we finished the mediocre meal, 6 of us left first and the other 5 stayed behind, while one person finished their food..
When the other 5 joined back up with us, we found out that they forced of them to pay $90, even though only one person ate. They even threatened to call the police! We called them back, demanding what that was all about, and not only did they lie and keep changing their story, they also told us to stop calling them and hung up. We tried calling them again, but they wouldn't answer. This is ridiculous. Not only did they take my friends' money, they also refused to give it back and didn't give us an explanation. They continuously hung up on us and repeatedly demonstrated horrible customer service.
If I could give negative stars, I would,
DO NOT COME HERE."}
{"text":"There weren't that many people when we came in the afternoon (weekday). Ordering from the iPad, the food came relatively fast. Also, they had a broad variety of foods to choose from, including ramen and soups which is the standard. My company and I ended up ordering too much and had to deal with the consequences but it was worth it. The walnut shrimp was a hit and I still remember the taste yumm. The out of control roll was huge (we've had it at another location before) and we couldn't finish it so order at your discretion!!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I moved into the area. I've been to many sushi restaurants and this the best one yet. The proportions on the sushi were close to perfect and the service was absolutely outstanding; very kind and timely. The only suggestion I have, its difficult to hear the waitresses as they whisper very faintly what is being presented to the table."}
{"text":"My current go-to for AYCE lunch sushi - mainly because it's decent quality at a decent price and super convenient to get to by car. Everything can be ordered via the iPad but there's no guarantee of it coming. Service is a hit or miss and can drag your time there out for about 30 minutes, but the convenience is what keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Maple Sushi is known as an AYCE sushi place but we always order take out when we got to fill up some stomachs on a weekend evening.  Always order the Maki Party tray which comes with 4 regular rolls and 2 special rolls.  The quality is top notch for an AYCE sushi place and their customer management system allows them to recall past orders so calling in doesn't have to be such a hassle.  They're always courteous and extremely friendly when dealing with us and that is the sole reason why we are one of their prized returning customers.  Too good.  Definitely, try out Maple Sushi, I don't know what makes them disparate from other AYCE Sushi places. I don't know if it's the service, environment, food or my total bias.  But it's some top notch take-out sushi. Total recommend."}
{"text":"Maple Sushi is now my go-to spot for sushi in the Maple area. The restaurant is conveniently located near St David's and there are tons of parking in the parking lot. The interior is nicely decorated and I'm almost always able to get a seat. The servers generally seat patrons in the booths on the sides. I've never seen anyone sit in the middle tables.

Patrons order on iPads. It's super-convenient and unlike other places, I always get what I ordered (i.e. they never forget an item). I like that unlimited drinks are included, including tea, soda, etc. The sushi is fresh, looks great, and tastes great. The shrimp tempura is always tasty. I really like their imitation crab meat tempura. Sashimi is served for dinner and is served in bowls of ice.

Overall, the quality of food for the price at Maple Sushi is unbeatable. It's definitely the best place you can go for sushi in the area."}
{"text":"We come here for AYCE Japanese and sometimes we order dinner for take out. Nice variety of rolls and sushi. Great selection of cooked dishes as well. We love the walnut shrimps. Must try."}
{"text":"We tried this for the first time for AUCE dinner and were pleasantly surprised by the selection, food portions and the ipad ordering system.  Food came out promptly and portions were generous.  The sashimi was cut nicely and placed on a bed of ice which kept it cool and more appealing to eat but just a warning before ordering that the slices were thicker than any other sushi place we've tried so maybe order less but more often.  Rolls were good but my only complaint here was that they were very large in size and some rolls had minimum 8 pieces so between 2 people, you can't try a variety of different rolls unless one/both of you are a bottomless pit.  Max 2-4 pieces per roll is more ideal for all variations of group size so you have a chance to try other things.  Soda was included with the price which was reasonable ($21.99 M-R dinner).  It was clean and spacious inside and the servers were prompt and courteous.  It was a good experience and we would return here again.  I recommend wearing your yoga pants or something with a drawstring if you're planning to come here....so much food!"}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much walking into a sushi place in Maple, however; this place served up some of the biggest sushi rolls I have ever had at an AYCE sushi joint. They were massive. 

As soon as we arrived we were promptly seated and noticed that the AC in this place must be free, because it was a friggin fridge. Bring a sweater ladies, you'll be cold within 3 minutes of sitting down. 

Onto the food, yes they do have an iPad ordering system. However, their wasn't much options in the rolls department. I counted around 10, but there's other categories (signature rolls, apps) that will keep you from starving. 

The waiters here were the worst part of the evening. They don't speak, they don't blink.. You'd think they're robots but even they can interact with human life. Also, the green tea pot isn't placed on the table as I've become accustomed to, so we had to wait for refills, which also sucked. 

Anyways.. Decor was okay, place was clean.. Food came out fairly quickly and the sushi rolls were honestly huge. The \"out of control\" sushi roll is an absolute must try. It was amazing. 

3/5 for me. One of the better sushi places that I've experienced, just wish their were more options on the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Whenever I go up to Canada my cousin take me to this place. The place is very nice. The staff is friendly.  You order through tablet and it come very fast.  The foods are very tasty there are so many variety to choose it is hard to choose which one. All it is this restaurant is definitely a must go and try especially if you have a large gathering like I had."}
{"text":"Good food, was happy to see that there was ordering available on iPads. The portions are very generous and the soup and salad is nice as an appetizer. The waitresses don't speak English very well so the iPads are a great addition. My sushi was warm when I picked it up but still delicious..."}
