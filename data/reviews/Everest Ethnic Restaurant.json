{"text":"New restaurant on Route 51 across from Brentwood Towne Square.  The interior is stark but the food more makes up for the atmosphere.  The fried momos (dumplings) are super.  The chicken vindaloo is rich and flavorful.  The chau chau noodles were in an herby broth full of vegetables.  Both dinner entrees were delicious!  Get some naan bread too!"}
{"text":"I always get the vegetable korma, so I can't attest to much of anything else..... but the veg korma is very good. So is the vegetable appetizer platter."}
{"text":"Well, I'd review the food if I could, but that turned out to be impossible, so instead I'm reviewing their appalling business practices. 

I recently ordered food delivered through the handy dandy order online feature available through Yelp and paid for it up front with my credit card. Two hours later I called the restaurant to ask what was up with my order. 

They said they never got it. 

So I called the company that facilitates ordering via Yelp to ask them what was up with my order. They confirmed that not only had my order been received, but the restaurant had in fact confirmed receipt of that order two hours previously. 

The super awesome customer service rep I was dealing with then called the restaurant. They told her that they got the order, but my house was too far away so they weren't going to do it. 

They didn't call the company to let them know. 

They didn't call me to let me know. 

They lied to me about what was happening when I called them. 

Apparently they were planning to just take my money. 

I recommend anyone dealing with this establishment be very careful."}
{"text":"The food here was very fresh and tasty. I recommend ordering from the menu because the buffet, while fresh and delicious, has a much smaller selection than many are used to finding at, say an Indian Restaurant buffet. The food is really very, very good and I do recommend them if you'd like a flavorful dish. I found the menu to be very much what I often see at an Indian restaurant, perhaps I need to educate myself further, but I had thought that perhaps there would be some Tibetan food that I was unaware of."}
{"text":"Everest is an authentic Nepali restaurant that specializes in both traditional Nepali food and Indian food.  My wife and I have been here twice and have stuck with the Nepali dishes.  We were not disappointed.  After trying both chicken momos and veggie momos, we decided that we prefer chicken momos fried ( you can also have them steamed. ) Ordering chau chau (veg or chicken) is a must on our list and we also enjoyed the thukpa.  This place is owned and staffed by Nepalis. The owner both cooks and serves tables.  He is starting out and is putting out a great product, eventually other logistics will come together and I am sure will warrant a 5th star.  On a final note, make sure to get the milk tea (chai)!"}
{"text":"Delicious dinner! Fresh, spicy and pippin' hot! Friendly staff and definitely coming back to venture into new items on the menu. The man who placed our food on the table, was so nice. I loved the way he gently placed our utensils into our bowl of food. I don't know, it was just so kind and lovely. :) 
The restaurant had several ethnic men, hanging out and one of them was very helpful with explaining some items on the menu. Overall, nice experience and I'm glad it's close to home!"}
{"text":"Wonderful family run restaurant with authentic Nepalese food.  Loved the samosas and lamb curry. Chicken Tikka Masala came through as a classic favorite for the group.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Indian food no way. All reviews are may be paid. We order dum alu 5 spicy it was ear burning spicy.  Nan thinner than papad .
Garlic nan garlic disappears. 
Normally vegitable come with rice. No rice.
I will never depand on yelp rating.  I thing paid rating. Horrible food."}
{"text":"I had to actually put my food down to write a review of this incredible place. I thought I had exhausted the selection of non-pizza takeout in the brentwood area when yelp brought this lovely little gem to my attention. set in a nondescript strip mall on route 51 just south of its intersection with Brownsville road, this place is easy to miss. (pause for a snack...okay let's do this.) The service was great. the people working there were so sweet and my food was on time.

For my entree I ordered the Tika Masala chicken. On the yelp ordering tool, there are 4 spicy levels: mild, medium, spicy and very spicy. I chose very spicy and put a note to make it as spicy as it gets because I can handle it. When they handed me my food it was accompanied by a small ramekin of red sauce. The gentleman told me this was for extra spice if I wanted, but that I should be careful because it's really spicy. the woman working the register agreed. \"it's hot\" she said. To be honest, at first I was skeptical of this. I have been handed many a ramekin of mystery red sauce at many a restaurant and told many a time that it was the spicy sauce to end all spicy sauces. I've been let down before. But folks, I say this to all my spicy food addicted friends: this is it. As soon as I got home I opened the ramekin of forbidden sauce and dipped my finger in it to try it because I'm a badass. it tasted like hot pepper extract. there is *no salt* in here. it's just the essence of the fires of hell distilled into perfection. Also, my food was pretty darn spicy to begin with. 

So it's obvious I'm a spicy food fanatic and this place hit the spot, but the quality of the food was also great. the Tika Masala was delicious and tasted homemade. It wasnt just spicy and nothing else, it had a great depth of flavor and noticeable notes of various spices that I embarrasingly can't identify. I could tell the chicken was fresh. The dish came with rice, but I ordered a side of Naan too. They obviously make this in-house as well. It was really good.

I also ordered a starter of the steamed vegetable mo mo and I love that as well. These are delicious plane or with the interesting spicy sauce they come with. I have been snacking on them while I write this review. You get 10 of them for 7.99, which brings me to my last thing:

Everest is really reasonably priced. I got all my food including my extra side of naan for under $20. Most entrees are about $10. I will definitely be back. get yourself there, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Well I come here quite often I like the veg chowmein if it's not burned and the cover of the  momos are fully cooked. All together I like it."}
{"text":"Best food ever I tested; especially love momo and chicken chaw chaw.  Staff is really nice and friendly. I recommend this place to everyone for Asian food."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  We enjoyed the Mutton soup, lamb curry, and mutton chow mein noodles.  We will definitely be returning!

June 2015 edit: We went there on a Saturday evening.  There were 2 other tables of people there.  The wait time was outrageous.  Didn't get drinks for 45 minutes.  We ordered a bunch of different appetizers and the first one didn't come for an hour even though the other 2 tables go their apps.  I didn't even get to eat my entree because by the time it came we had already been there for 2 hours and we had to leave so we could get my son to bed.  The mango juice was watered down this time.  The food was still excellent but the service was so slow that it ruined the experience for me this time so I had to drop the rating by a star.  We'll go again but if the service is this slow again, I don't know if I can continue to go here."}
{"text":"Sooooo delicious!  I have been back three times and each time is better.  Both the Indian and the Nepalese options are great - I loved the chow mein, the momos, the samosas and especially the spinach paneer.  Service is excellent and the food is obviously homecooked.  51 needed some good South Asian food and this is it!"}
{"text":"The owner, Pushpa, is from eastern Nepal, so food is very authentic. Rup introduced himself as the manager.  The web site says Rup is a certified chef. The dining room is clean and spacious.  Come when you have a lot of time. Food is cooked to order. In fact, Ram, the waiter, advised calling ahead to have your meal waiting:  412-207-9638. A couple ladies at the next table had their meal packed up because they didn't have time to enjoy it once it was finally prepared. 

The milk tea (spicy) is delicious. I ordered tomato and mushroom soup and chau chau fried noodles.  Both were very tasty.  The food was slightly more oily and spicy than the typical American palette tolerates, but I found the food digested very well.  The restaurant has been open only 3 months.  Faster service would likely gain the fifth star.  For an authentic and delicious Nepali meal, try Everest Ethnic Restaurant."}
{"text":"We returned for a second time in 10 days. What a find! The food is wonderful. We had steamed and fried chicken Mo-mos. Nepali salad. Next chicken chow mein, pork thukpa, lamb curry. All with the fragrant and delicious Nepali red tea. Perfect.
The atmosphere is simple and the Nepali people are refreshingly friendly. We will surely return soon."}
{"text":"July 6th, 2014 - My first taste of Nepali dish at a Nepali Restaurant in Pittsburgh, PA after living in the city for more than a decade. Any my experience was just \"A-OK\". 

We were driving back from Ohiopyle from a long weekend of hiking and biking - when we decided to stop here for dinner. The restaurant sitting area and a \"party hall\" was being vacuumed as we walked in. I was told that a wedding party had just ended but the restaurant was still open for business. The restaurant has more of a cafeteria/dinner settings with a row of corner booths.

Now comes the mouth watering part - which we were hoping for. Since it's supposed a Nepali Ethnic Restaurant, we chose to order only Nepali dish. We were a group of five - so we ordered the Non Veg Thali for 2 (chicken and mutton), chicken chowmein, Chicken Momo and Chicken curry with Rice. Apparently they were out of Chicken Momos so we got the Veg Momo instead. Everything seemed fresh and the Manager assured that everything was cooked fresh and from scratch. There's also several Indian Dish on the Menu which was a lot cheaper compared to the Nepali Dish which I can understand but the Thali in my opinion seemed a bit high. As a Nepalese and having cooked and tasted Nepali Dish myself - the food here was okay and authentic to some extend.

Everyone working here was very friendly and the service was pretty good. My recommendation to fellow yelpers if you happen visit this place - stick to the Nepali Dish."}
{"text":"Worst Nepalese food I ever had. Service was pathetic, weren't even offered water upon arrival. Food was not upto standard of most Nepalese / Indian cuisine in town. Even the ambience is poor and depressing. Would never go back to this place."}
{"text":"I've waited far too long to try this place. I was actually hoping I'd hate it because I'm moving out of town in a week and won't be able to get back for more. I was disappointed. It. Was. Amazing. 

I ordered for pickup and it was done exactly when they said. 35 minutes. 

Everything I got was great. Fried chicken mo mos. That dipping sauce was out of control. 

Goat curry. So good. So. Good. Spicy, rich, all the things. 

My wife got the tikka. She enjoyed it. 

Support this business, friends!"}
{"text":"Definitely check this place out--I was unaware of other Nepali places other than Subba, but come all the way out here and you'll find Everest. The service and the restaurant interior could use a bit of improvement, but they make up for it with the great food. In terms of the entrees, it seems like they focus on a few main dishes--fried noodles, fried rice, curry rice--and then vary the types of seasonings and sauces depending on the meat. We tried out the lamb vindaloo and mutton chau chau. Both had pretty complex levels of flavor--I would probably not be able to name half the spices they use. The noodles of the chau chau have some similarities with chow mein, but they are cut shorter and less noddles relative to the vegetables and meat, the latter of which was tender and gamey (in a good way). The vindaloo was a larger dish, and consisted of a very hearty curry of delicious lamb. Both dishes complemented each other well for a great meal."}
{"text":"The food here is great! Order the momos and you won't be disappointed! We typically go all vegetarian and it's delicious. I am so glad that the south Hills is finally getting an ethnic and good restaurant! We've taken our family members who are not \"adventurous\" eaters here and they liked it to. Come, eat and keep a great new local restaurant in business!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a Saturday and were one of the only tables filled. There's a sign at the counter which says your wait time may be 5 minutes, so we grabbed menus and sat ourselves - hearing and smelling cooking from the kitchen area in the back. In a few minutes, a waiter came to take our drink order, followed by another waiter a few minutes later to take our food order. Unfortunately, they were out of mutton, but they did have eggs chow mein (in a spicy sauce), chicken curry momos (dumplings) with a flavorful ginger dipping sauce, and vegetable thukpa (a traditional Nepalese stew). The food was all pretty hearty comfort food - pleasantly spicy and filled with plenty of fresh vegetables. 

Everest is a surprisingly large strip mall restaurant out on 51. The atmosphere is pretty spartan and awkward, but I would be more than happy to go back for takeout or bring a bottle of wine (they are BYOB) and have a reasonable night out with a small group. (Almost everything on the menu is under $10.) Perhaps if they get more popular, they will fill their many tables and it will be a bustling fun place."}
{"text":"We ordered steamed chicken momo, chicken chau chau noodles and egg fried rice. 

Chicken momo - I have tried momo's before and I love them. The main reason for me to go to this place was momo's. But  I have to say it looked like they were straight outta freezer and warmed them up in an oven. Not good!!

Chicken Chau Chau - Tried this one after reading yelp reviews. It was not up to the mark. The noodles were so dry and bland. We ordered a spicy level 8 on 10 but it was no where near even 3. Not good!!

Chicken fried rice - this was even drier than chau chau. The rice and chicken was all dried up (may be it was cooked long back and stored in freezer). Not good!!

I was so excited to go this place as I haven't tried momo for a while but it was a complete let down."}
{"text":"Just have to have Indian food every month or so.  We have a great restaurant in Florida that my wife and I love.  But we had a hard time finding something in the Pittsburgh area.

Thanks to Yelp I was led to Everest Ethnic today.  What a pleasant surprise and wonderful meal.  Ordered Chicken Tikka Masala to go via Yelp and it was very good.  

Reasonable price and ten minutes from where I am staying for the summer - will definitely be back for Vindalo"}
{"text":"Oh my god. This food is so good. I loved the veggie korma with naan and rice. We also ordered the chicken taka masala, and a pork noodle bowl. Everything was very tasty. We sampled some other items too and there wasn't anything that was a disappointment. The food did take a long while to arrive, but with an appetizer of mo mo, samosas, and pleasant company and conversation the time passes quickly. Maybe order ahead if you're in a hurry. We got these weird honey balls for dessert that tasted like parmesan cheese. They were strange, but ok to try. The inside isn't crazy fancy, but it's comfortable and clean. The restrooms are clean as well.  Also reasonably priced. Water and pop in bottles. I suspect they didn't charge us for bottled water and we had like 6 of them.  Also, I think I saw on the website that you can bring your own (non alcoholic) drinks. May want to look into that."}
{"text":"My husband and I left in agreement -- this was one of the worst places either of us has ever eaten. The restaurant was completely empty and silent when we arrived around 1pm to have lunch. We ordered tea, vegetarian mo-mo dumplings, and two curry dishes. The tea and dumplings were fine but definitely a bit over spiced. Then the two main dishes were utterly inedible. Flavorless. Lumpy. With ingredients that could not have been fresh. Totally gross."}
{"text":"The food was overpriced for what we got, I ordered paneer tika masala for 10.99 (Tuesday lunchtime) and it was a lunch sized portion for a dinner sized prices. The onion bahji was overly salty and the atmosphere needs a lot of work. They are opening up a lunch buffet next week, so that might be better priced."}
{"text":"I was in here in July 2015 and recently  in March 2017.  
We Called  in orders for take out,  ordered a whole bunch of stuff.  It was all excellent!  Seriously I don't think you can go wrong. The place is BYO.  And is cool.  It looks like a base camp where you could get a crew together for some wild adventuring.   
Everest we'll see you next time we are in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been here and I ordered takeout. I got the mutton curry and Naan. The curry I chose medium spiciness and it is DEFINITELY spicy. There was no one there, but it was 1:45 I the afternoon. This is some of the best mutton curry I've had. The Naan is kind of sweet and compliments well. I will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Found this place driving on 51 and decided to give it a try. Best decision, place was quiet, food was delicious and the service was good, and all that for a good price."}
{"text":"Wonderful Nepali food, atmosphere is average. Service is humble, but friendly!"}
