{"text":"Gave this place another try after a terrible first experience. First time had a chicken and rice dish, was rubbery and lack luster. Second time really needed Pho, and their Pho is good. They were also really friendly, and it turns out to be a good place for kids. If you have kiddos, and need soup, this is an excellent place. Now we go so very very often. I cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Had a very pleasant lunch here with my wife while we were visiting Cleveland. We ordered the fresh rolls with shrimp, which were very good, and packed with veggies. I ordered the drunken noodles with chicken and my wife had the chicken pho with extra veggies. The service was good and quick; the food was hot and very tasty, although I did use sriracha to kick up the spice a bit. The prices were very reasonable and the portions were generous. Great place for a good, casual meal."}
{"text":"Okay so we have been looking for a good Thai restaurant in Cleveland for some time. We love Asian food but to be honest there are great places here in the area yet none of them are great at everything...we read the reviews on this place before we came in...And we found the suggested entrees and Pho's were dead on! The Hot and sour soup was phenomenal! Fresh ground chicken and peanuts with an AMAZING spicy broth.. The Vietnamese Sandwich Will have me coming back here as often as possible for the rest of my life! You must try this place because it is truly a hidden gem on Coventry!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place the other night- I'm so glad there's Pho closer to Case campus now!  As a relatively new business on Coventry, I think they still have room for growth with atmosphere and timeliness of service.    We did have to wait a bit for our meal, but it was worth it!  The size of the Pho bowls were enormous, which was great IMO, but I think I'd have liked a few more items to add to mine- no mint leaves when I went :/  I plan to go back and hope to try their other dishes as well."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten a lot of pho in my life so I can't compare it to any other pho experiences. Generous portions and quick service. My more experienced pho eating friend was not very impressed. Simple little place close by."}
{"text":"The vermicelli dishes and pho are good but this restaurant loves to skimp on giving out anything. Their appetizers are particularly over priced and not that good for what they're asking (one scallion pancake for instance for $4.95, was 4 pieces of small pancake cut up!). I'd say stick to entrees."}
{"text":"This the best thai's noodle in cleveland.  The beef noodle and yen-ta-fo taste authentically just like in thailand . papaya salad and sticky rice are another of my favorites."}
{"text":"Extremely nice waitstaff! The only reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because I felt the prices are a bit high (although I am a broke college student). That being said, the pho is consistently delicious here. I always get the meat, and have heard good things about the meat and tripe option too. Their appetizers are also delicious, as are their drink specials. Definitely go here!!"}
{"text":"noodles tastes good. service is top notch and friendly. ask them for anything and they will be willing to help. always a place to grab my lunch"}
{"text":"Truly not interested in throwing this place under the bus love Vietnamese food but was disappointed ..wish they could take a lesson from Min ahn which is a favorite for many many years of mine! Poor ventilation so grease smell as soon as they dropped in our fried  tofu appetizer ..small portions unimpressive until adding sriracha and plum sauce which helps anything taste better! I suggest you hire the real deals in the kitchen to do the cooking ; not that you aren't authentic; just so so...wish you good luck/future!"}
{"text":"So glad this place opened up in Coventry...definitely will go again!  As a vegetarian, I appreciated all of the options that were available to me on the menu.  I had the summer rolls with tofu and the fried tofu triangles, which were both excellent and the scallion pancake (I prefer mine a little less crispy, but it was still good).  The best part about this place was my meal---the tofu vermicelli.  Even my non-vegetarian husband, who had the vermicelli with beef (which he also really liked) kept stealing my dish.  We had mango sticky rice for dessert, which was also excellent.  Service was also great and portions are a good size (we had leftovers).  About the same price as other similar restaurants in the area.  I'd recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"This was the 1st time I've ever ordered from Pho & Rice. After reading some reviews, I was more disappointed than happy. I ordered spring rolls, the combo: Grilled Pork and Beef Sa-Wan and fried Gyoza. The springs rolls and Gyoza were great.  But to pay $14.95 for a combo and only get 4 pieces of beef and 2 pieces of pork....quite ridiculous!!! I assumed they would be in separate boxes as they are separate dishes...however, they were stuffed into the same box! Talk about being jipped!!! If I do happen to order something from them again, it will not be that combo!"}
{"text":"Good and affordable place to dine in with soft covers of current and old pop hits. I got the vegetable pho and it was delicious and surprisingly filling- best to eat it hot/warm. They also had both chopsticks and forks on the table to prevent the embarrassment of asking for a fork! Their dessert menu is a bit lacking, they had only mango sticky rice the day I went, but it was delicious just like everything else. I would definitely come back here because it's affordable, tasty food."}
{"text":"Plans for dinner today started with Mexican. But after a whole afternoon watching Mr Bourdain eating in Hong Kong, Singapore, and China Town in Manhattan, I find myself walking towards Pacific East recommended by a friend, on Coventry Rd and Mayfield. For some reason, I looked across of the street: PHO & RICE! Let me tell you, very simple, small, cozy and 10 tables. Friendly service and DELICIOUS FOOD!  I had the best crab ragoons in Cleveland. I also ordered their fried gyosa (very light and delicate) and spicy drunken rice noodles w/ beef (tons of flavor from the peppers, fresh basil, crushed red pepper). IT IS A MUST TRY! I'm coming back to have the Pho..."}
{"text":"It's a simple, authentic and cozy neighborhood restaurant. I had noodles with grilled chicken and was pretty satisfied. I was expecting a bigger portion of noodles, though. My husband had udon with beef, and said beef was too hard to chew, but the broth was delicious. Food was fresh and prices were fair. Next time, I will try the subs!"}
{"text":"We enjoy this on a regular basis - delicious pho, reasonable prices and great service. They have a kids portion which is perfect for any child.    Accommodates a crowd (10-15) with advanced notice."}
{"text":"Pho is a love of mine - learning to make it from scratch for our household has been quite the gift to myself this year. Unfortunately, cooking it from scratch and frequenting an unbelievable restaurant in Downtown Los Angeles has quite possibly spoiled me for any other of the like. I was craving Pho on this cold day so we did a quick search on Yelp - Pho & Rice pinged highest in proximity to Little Italy - but we found both of our meals [ Pho Ga (chicken) and Grilled Pork Vermicelli ] to be sub par in taste and substance. The chicken was very dry and the noodles in both meals were over-cooked.   I did find the Thai Ice Tea to be amazing in flavor and it had beautiful color!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Pho & Rice for Crab Rangoon and Bubble Tea. It was pretty good. If you like bubble/boba tea, I recommend the Thai Tea, it's really good!"}
{"text":"It was wonderPHO ! Best pho king thing I had all week. This place is PHOnomenal. Great place pho friends to meet and eat! Oh! I almost PHOgot the pho is really good but if pho's not pho you they have plenty of options."}
{"text":"I really enjoy dining at pho and rice. Don't be fooled by the name because they serve more than just pho and rice. The restaurant is small but food is very fresh and portions are generous. Of the East Asian dining options in the Cleveland heights area, in my opinion, Pho & Rice is the best. The staff is very friendly. Overall a good value option. I would recommend this place without hesitation."}
{"text":"Amazing. The end. All of it and the bubble tea! I got drunken noodles with chicken and a green tea blended drink and all of it was literally perfect ."}
{"text":"By far the best pho in Ohio.. This is the place I go whenever I feel like having pho... My food has/had always been consistent no matter what time of the day I come, which is nice, cause that means I am never disappointed and always look forward to good pho..   Yes, I'm one of those ppl who once find what I like, I stick to it.. That way I won't walk away hungry and disappointed  Couple things I have tried that I like and dislike  Likes:   *Vegetarian pho add Fried tofu *Bf Ho Fun *Taro baba tea  Dislike  * scallion pancakes(the way they cook not my cup of tea)    I somehow always end up getting vegetarian pho  Overall: definitely as long as I live in Ohio, they will always have my business   Yum!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great little place in the hipster part of Cleveland. Great food with a local homie atmosphere. My pink seafood pho was just right in flavor. The servers were extremely nice and I'm glad I drove a little further to experience this part of town."}
{"text":"Pretty good Pho! I like to go to Superior Pho if I have the extra time but this place is also good! The waits arent as long, and they have some other things on the menu as well.  It's right on Coventry, next to all the other restaurants and stores!"}
{"text":"This was my first pho experience and I didn't really know what to expect. My sister wanted pho for her birthday dinner and Superior Pho was closed so we ended up ordering takeout from here. When I came to pick up our (large) order, everything was neatly labeled with the meal number and letter combination, which was very helpful. The staff was also very friendly. The food was okay, I've had better. We got a few different kinds of pho and some crab rangoon (pretty good). The pad thai was the best part of all of it. The sauce was really really good. I may come back, but I'll try Superior Pho first."}
{"text":"Pretty much everything you'd expect from a little Pho spot in Coventry... Good food, but often the beef is way overcooked. Will keep going back!"}
{"text":"Got my ears lowered at the local Eddy's Barbershop and hit this fine establishment for dinner! I have to say, I'm a fan. I didn't really hear great things about Pho and Rice, but now I'm realizing that I need to visit this place even more. I had the Drunken Noodle with tofu, and it was phenomenal. For those who frequent Tree Country and High Thai'd (both places I love), this dish will throw you a bit of a curveball. The flat rice noodles are much wider and thicker than expected, but that just heightens the flavor you get with each bite! The atmosphere leaves a little to be desired, but to me that's not of the utmost importance. If you're longing for some noodles or pho on one of The Land's many cold blustery winter days, don't miss this place on the corner of Mayfield and Coventry Road!"}
{"text":"There are certain food habits I will not abandon, and will compulsively fulfill at the expense of my health or sanity. One important food habit I have is to seek out Pho when I don't feel well. This was very easy to manage when I lived in Hawaii; the relative rarity of being actually sick combined with the relative abundance of places to get Pho made my compulsion easy to manage. Fast forward to 2017 and here I am, back under iron-gray skies, damp cold and at the mercy of cold-and-flu season once again. Luckily there are quite a few places to get the best Eastern medicine Western dollars can buy: Pho with rare beef, tendon and tripe.  Pho and Rice is a bright, unassuming storefront in Coventry road in Cleveland Heights, one block from the fabulous Big Fun which is right across from a municipal parking garage. Pho and Rice has a decent menu of Thai, Vietnamese and Japanese soups and other dishes. Service was quick and friendly. A smaller order of Pho was $7.95, the Soba noodle soup was $9.95. Both were quite good; I would have to say the Soba Noodle Soup was more of a standout, the broth was remarkably good. That is not to say the Pho wasn't also good; it was delicious, but the Soba noodles were so, so good.   I recommend this as a great lunch date. Fun neighborhood to explore, good food, interesting people to meet or just watch, ample inexpensive city meter parking in a garage. And, for the record, my cold cleared up the next day. Because Pho."}
{"text":"The pho broth is good. No MSG, no pho seasoning mix, and just the way old Vietnamese people like having it for breakfast (at least that's what the old Vietnamese ghost that lives in my house told me).   I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about when they say the pho broth is too sweet - traditional pho usually has an adequate amount of rock sugar in the broth, and it seemed to be at an appropriate level.   My only gripe is the beef preparation for the pho. I had the pho tai. I usually like putting it in raw, letting it cook in the broth. It was too tough the last couple times I've had it, and may be because they froze the meat too long. Haven't tried the brisket, which I suspect is better.  Tip: no MSG so no need for too much sriacha or hoisin. Taste, then add.  Bumped to 3 stars because it is better than most Cleveland pho shops, but it would be lower if it were in major V-towns, like Westminster, San Jose, San Diego, etc"}
{"text":"Was excited to try a pho restaurant so close by to Coventry so I came with a friend a couple months ago.  Ultimately, I thought it was a decent place.  Decor was kinda meh, service was polite but the pho was lacking.  The broth was not as good as Superior Pho and the portion was not very generous.  Would I go in a pinch?  Perhaps but not if I really was wanting solid pho.  Might try this place again but probably won't.  To many other great places to eat at."}
{"text":"So, I really love soup, but Pho is a step up, with various kinds of meats and healthy veggies, it definitely can be a meal in itself.   That's why Pho and Rice is one of my goto spots now.  Tucked next to Grumm's on Coventry, this little place serves a decent sized portion, great appetizers, other items such as Pad Thai and the like, their menu is replete with tasty stuff that'll warm you inside and out.   Parking is just around the corner, either street or at the Coventry Garage, and, the service was really good. I also was really happy with the dish of extra veggies (sprouts, fresh basil, etc.) that they give you add body to an already packed bowl. From first drop to last, it was a treat.   So, if you want something tasty whilst out on the go, stop up in the Heights and get thee some Pho:)  (Yes, I am getting cornier:)"}
{"text":"I ordered the Pho Ga (chicken), fried gyoza, strawberry smoothie, and a mango smoothie for my bud.  The broth was sweeter than any other I've had, which I didn't like. I added sriracha which helped a little. The bean sprouts, jalapenos, onions and culantro were really fresh.  The gyoza was pretty good and I like that they gave the option of fried or steamed.  Most other places just serve it steamed without asking, in my experience.  I didn't enjoy the strawberry smoothie at all.  There were no bits of fruit in it and it had too much liquid in it as though it had been melting for a while and then it proceeded to melt very fast, which perplexed me.  I gave it to my S.O. and she liked it and my friend liked his mango smoothie, so perhaps it was just me but the smoothie was just not what i was expecting.    THEY DON'T GIVE REFILLS ON REGULAR FOUNTAIN DRINKS.  This the first time I've been to restaurant that didn't.  Its indicated on the menu. When we first walked in we were told to sit anywhere, so we sat at the bar-style seats facing the front window.  It was good seating because we were able to people-watch and take good pictures of each other and the food with natural light.  The waitress looked like she was only person working (other than chefs).  She gave us mason jars with ice water immediately but didn't return to take our drink orders as most restaurants do.  We ordered our drinks, appetizer, and entree all at once and we weren't checked on or asked if we wanted to order dessert. There were no napkins.  The waitress brought the bill without asking if we were together or separate...and we were two young adult college-aged females and a teenage male so I think that was exceptionally presumptuous of her.  It wouldn't have been a big deal if we were all using the same form of payment but we were not.  Though I was slightly put off by the service and my meal, the restaurant was very clean with a fine ambiance."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! The food is very fresh and flavorful. The staff is super nice too. I will definitely be back. Got the crab Rangoon and they were amazing. Drunken noodles were great also."}
{"text":"this place is a gem. best pho I've had in Cleveland. staff is warm and friendly and service is quick. I would recommend this to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Quickly becoming one of my favorite spots on Coventry.  Their pho dishes are almost at a Superior Pho level in my opinion. I love the hot and sour noodle soup. I also don't understand the complaints about portion size. I have a hearty appetite and I leave extremely full every time. I've also noticed that P&R includes more rice noodles in the soups than most places do.   I've also tried the Crispy Rolls and edamame and both were delicious."}
{"text":"Best bubble tea on the block. (The best I've ever had!) Try the Thai Iced Tea bubble tea smoothie with tapioca pearls!"}
{"text":"I love good pho. Pho and rice has one of the best I've had yet in the Cleveland area. You get the usual sides and a nice large portion. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"I have been to Pho & Rice probably 4 times or so. Each time I have been satisfied with the service and the food. This last time I went (Friday evening), it was sub-par. I had to send my pad thai back for modification. They first came to the table after we ordered to tell me that the usual rice noodle that they use in pad thai was no good (not really explaining more than that). My husband suggested to the server that I just get the wide pan fried noodles like what he was getting, but everything else pad thai style. What they brought me was awful, and I sent it back. The noodles were just spongy, mushy, and had no flavor. My dish was also missing the requisite peanuts and scallions. 5 minutes or so later, they brought my dish back. It didn't look much different, but the peanuts and scallions were present, and the dish a little less saucy, and more wok-fired.   Other than that, my husband's drunken noodle dish was well done, with extra spiciness he requested. And as always, the honeydew bubble tea was on point.   I'm chalking this one up to a bad day, but I may be tempted to try some other thai houses on Coventry next time I need my pad thai fix."}
{"text":"The closest pho place near Case Western, I definitely wanted to try it out. My friend and I stopped in here for a quick lunch after studying across the street at Phoenix.   Probably because I'm so spoiled by the pho at Superior Pho in Asiatown, I was really disappointed by the quality of the food. It was just okay. The flavor has got a bit of weird smell that's not really as savory or as delicious as the broth that you get at Superior. Also, there's not enough meat!   However, the meal was saved by the yummy bahn mi sandwich that we ordered. The bread is perfectly toasted and the creamy sauce and the meat really made my belly happy. So if I were to come again, I'd skip the pho and go straight for the sandwich."}
{"text":"Small venue on Coventry, great for pho. Servers are friendly and the food comes quick. I like the bubble tea, it comes as a smoothie instead of just tea."}
{"text":"This is a Thai run, vietnamese crossover restaurant with a balance of both cuisines on the menu.  So, unsurprisingly, I found the Larb much better than the Beef Terriyaki Bun (is there such a thing?) that I ordered.    Decor is light and playful with soft earth tones - simple and non-obtrusive.  Having only been here once, I can't speak with any depth to the menu, but given the thickness of the bun (vermicelli), that the balance of the chef's taste do not run to traditional vietnamese.  The overall balance is towards sugary in their sauces (tried 2 different Bun s in our group).  The Larb was excellent, however... and worth another go.  Should I come again, I'll re-assess."}
{"text":"I was overjoyed when I found out that there was a pho place opening in Coventry! However, the food at Pho & Rice is quite disappointing.   I ordered the papaya salad, which was refreshing and flavorful, but the portion size was just ridiculous! For the same price elsewhere, I can get three times that portion size. I also ordered the banh mi, which was quite tasty as well, but it was seriously the size of an eggroll... The pho was kind of disappointing. You can definitely tell that they put a lot of MSG in it!   If you're looking for a satisfying meal, I suggest going to Superior Pho or any other pho places in Asia Town. For the same price, you'll literally get 2 times more food!"}
{"text":"Long-time PHO lover transplanted from the west coast before #1 Pho was in existence.  Long drive for me get from the eastern suburbs to either #1 or Superior.  Low and behold ... now I just have to go to Coventry to get my regular Pho fix.  Minimalistic decor that for me fits right in for a good Pho place.  Plus a few things on the menu that the others do not offer ... hadn't had a scallion pancake in quite some time.  I wouldn't drive past the others to visit Pho & Rice ... but having the place close to me is a joy.  Remember this: Having Pho 2 days in a row will cure any illness!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Food and service is great.  If you're getting take out though, then be aware that I have never--not once--gotten my order exactly as asked. I'm always missing something--be it the chopsticks, or teriyaki, or Sriracha, or lime wedges, or Thai tea. Maybe I'm just cursed."}
{"text":"A small little known shop that has picked up many of the best servers from tree country. The amount of food pretty order was perfect, the extras like sprouts and peppers were plentiful, the meat was fresh, everything was pleasant from the service to the atmosphere. The bubble tea here might be the best in Coventry and I would recommend everyone check it out, it's inexpensive and you get a lot of quality food for the price."}
{"text":"Best and only pho I've ever had! I had tofu in my pho and it was really flavorful and had good spices. The dumplings were hot and delicious. Very crispy texture. The service was extremely fast. I only wish that there were more people filling up water because I got quite thirsty!"}
{"text":"Charming space to enjoy pho and more. I got the chicken pho and thought it was delicious- maybe best I've had. The broth was light and fresh tasting with ample chicken and noodles. Small size was enough for me. Can't wait to try something else there. Servers/owner very polite and professional."}
{"text":"My partner and I visited Pho & Rice on a Tuesday night. On entry, we were greeted warmly by a host who instructed us to sit wherever we like. I must admit that I love this format of seating at any sit-down restaurant as it allows me to choose a well-lit seat (or not, if it's a particularly vampiric night).  For a starter, we ordered the scallion pancakes. I tend to be pretty picky about these as I've found it's easy to overcook them. These ones were cooked exquisitely. Delightfully crispy, but not bone-crunchingly hard as I've seen them at places that overcompensated by overcooking.  For my entree, I had the teri-tofu rice dish. The teriyaki sauce was perfectly sweet, and it was served with a perfectly cooked ball of rice and some steamed vegetables that were delightfully seasoned and perfectly plated.  To top things off, the staff were extremely attentive and simultaneously patient when we weren't quite ready to order initially.   I will absolutely return to this restaurant, and I'd encourage everyone else to visit. The food was delightful, and the atmosphere was the same."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite Vietnamese/Thai spots in Cleveland. Good food, decent service, and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"It's really not fair to compare Pho & Rice with Superior Pho. It's like comparing chicken breast to chicken thigh -- both chicken, but essentially different.  The owners here are from Thailand, so you can taste the Thai influence in their broth and many other dishes. The hot and sour noodle soup is basically a soup version pad Thai, very flavorful; Lemongrass chicken is so tender and tasty, and the basic pho is light but still have some great flavors.   My favorite thing on their menu is chicken wings. So crispy and juicy, perfect with the chili sauce.   This is a small business, so they tend to not do as well when they have a larger volume of customers with increased wait time, and the servers would look frantic. This is the reason why I give 4 starts and not 5. Still will come back to support this cozy little restaurant."}
{"text":"Solid pho.  We came here for an early dinner and were really impressed with the broth and the tenderness of the beef.  One of the best bowls we've had.  The menu does have a variety of other Vietnamese choices, but being that the weather was on the cooler side today, we wanted a hot bowl of pho.  Parking is limited and recommend parking in the city parking deck a half block away.  Bring quarters for the meters bc they don't take any other form of payment.  The service was very fast and friendly.  Glad we  found this place.  Thanks Yelpers."}
{"text":"I've really only ordered like one thing from pho and rice, and that is the curry noodles. omg it's so good. it's everything i've ever wanted. so much curry soup, delicious tofu, and noodles. i'm salivating just at the thought. this time i went with my friend and we shared the curry noodles, basil tofu, and scallion pancakes. the scallion pancakes were delicious and flaky with a nice sweet soy sauce dip. the basil tofu could have been spicier but it was just as good. this place has more of a thai flavor, so things are much sweeter than you would get at a vietnamese place. next time i'll try the pho. maybe. i don't know, the curry noodle is just so good, it'll be hard to not get it, again. also i like sitting at the window and people watching on coventry. always interesting.."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants! And what I love about it that the meal is super big, but still healthy and not so much calories!"}
{"text":"First time trying Pho and Rice. I ordered the crab rangoon for an appetizer. Best crab rangoon I've ever had. It was fresh out of the fryer. It was crispy and warm and dipped in the fish sauce made me want to order more. For the entrée i got the vermicelli pork dish. It was pretty good. Decent portion size. I would definitely come back for the crab rangoon though."}
{"text":"Decent place to get pho if your into that sort of thing. Im not knocking it but they feature a lot of other Asian dishes. They're big on Thai as well. Crab rangoons are delicious. The menu is very extensive and prices are reasonable. It's very clean and nicely decorated. Location is fabulous, right on Coventry.  The pho is a kind of meat and vegetable soup with noodles but a lot of people eat with chopsticks. You can get it in a multitude of ways. Also try some of ther fish dishes. Everything is under about 14 dollars plus a beverage. Park in the street."}
{"text":"Ordered yellow curry, hot n sour soup, crab rangoons, Angel shrimp, all good. Basil chicken, average at best. This place specialize in soups for sure. Don't pass up this gem, it's awesome!"}
{"text":"I first tried the P4 (chicken pho) when I was sick with the flu. It hit the spot and Pho & Rice quickly became my go to neighborhood eatery. I have since tried many things on the menu and have never ever been disappointed. The portions are great and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I had just gotten to my hotel after a long day of flying and found a menu for this restaurant. I was disappointed in what I received. My sesame shrimp was covered in a thick batter and the brown tangy sauce just wasn't that tasty. I also ordered the fried mama rolls that were suppose to be chicken but it looked like some mystery meat. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"While I've had better pho, it doesn't mean this pho is bad by any means. It's actually very tasty!   What keeps me coming back here is:  - It's easy - It's quick - It's fresh - Good pho!  - Great service! - Cheap prices  Plus some new discoveries: Their crab rangoon is pretty delicious. I think it would use a little less cream cheese and a little more crab. But I'm not complaining. These little morsels are so good. And they give you a slice of watermelon at the end of your meal! LOVE.   On AUG 1st they're serving their pho up for just $5 in celebration of their 1 year anniversary!"}
{"text":"This is not Vietnamese food. The menu descriptions are misleading: instead of fresh vegetables, I got boiled frozen broccoli and carrots. The sauce tasted like it was out of a bottle. Where is the owner of this new restaurant? This was Hunan Coventry quality, and that's not a compliment. I think I'll be sticking with Superior Pho."}
{"text":"This was a decent place for Pho that will bring me back occasionally due to proximity, but there are a couple things I wish were better. I think Pho is better than no Pho, however, there are a few reasons this place fell short of my expectations. First, in Seattle, this is about the cheapest meal you can buy, so it's unfortunate to have to pay twice as much for it now. Secondly, I thought it could be a little more flavorful. Some of the typically fragrant ingredients seemed a little muted. I did think the portion size for the large was a good amount, however, I would have liked more meat, more bean sprouts, and more basil. Overall, it will satisfy my occasional Pho craving developed on the West Coast, but price and undistinguished flavor will keep me from being a regular here."}
{"text":"Two for two, and counting.  Having come from the Bay Area, I realize I took for granted all the great, accessible and eclectic Asian food. I am grateful for this joint. It's bare-bones and simple on decor, but makes up for in the hearty dishes. Pho is pho and they do it well - with ample meat and Thai basil. Had the scallion pancakes the other day - what little pouches of joy! I wish there were more than two pieces. As for the noodle dishes - the drunken noodle was spicy and doughy with a good bit of meat and veggies, though I thought it could have had more pasta. Overall, pho is a sure bet, and the noodles was good, but I'll have to do more dining before I pass a more informed verdict on the rest of the entrees."}
{"text":"Pho & Rice is the perfect place to warm up on a chilly day! The Pho is some of the best around, not too salty and not too bland, just perfect! I got the Pho Ga and my fiancé got the Pho Thai, two times in one week. Each time it tasted just as great which tells me the chef is consistent! Definitely recommend and will be returning!"}
{"text":"Favorite dishes: scallion pancakes, grilled pork vermicelli, the pho with beef and tendon, and pad see yu.  I eat here at least once a week, and I guess I've earned some kind of special status because now sometimes they offer me dishes that aren't on the menu.  Today I ate a huge bowl of noodles topped with hard-boiled eggs, fermented cabbage, Chinese broccoli, and shredded ham hock.  With a side of some brutally spicy sauce.  And after that we got red bean popiscles.  It was so good!  Not going to get much done for the next few hours.   In conclusion, I love Pho & Rice and you should too."}
{"text":"The pho - 5 stars  Bahn Mi- 1 star  Service - 5 stars  Boba Tea- 3 stars   This place isn't amazing and it's also not horrible.  The pho was the highlight, the broth was very tasty. The boba tea was ok, a little too powdery for my liking and not enough tapioca balls in the drink- they really skimp you on the bobas. The Bahn Mi, is not a Bahn mi- the bread was regular sandwich roll bread, not a flaky French baguette that I'm used to having Bahn Mis on the vegetables were way too sweet and the mayonnaise over powering."}
{"text":"Cute little place. I love their beef broth for 5 bucks and a side of $2 steamed noodles. This is my go to for carry out on a cool day whenever I'm sick and out saved me from starvation when I got dental work. The chicken broth isn't my favorite because of it's sweetness. I haven't tried anything what but my fiancee has and he said it was delicious."}
{"text":"I probably wouldn't come back. Vietnamese food is pretty standard so i was surprised at how off-tasting my rice dish was. their nuoc cham does not have a super pleasant flavor and the beef with my dish tasted burnt somehow even though it was not actually burnt. biggest complaint: WHY would you use spring mix and spinach with everything?? iceberg lettuce might be less healthy but my fresh roll and rice plate were very bizarre and less appetizing because of this. spring mix and hot rice are a bad, bad combo. I'll stick to Vietnamese on the west side."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time. (I ordered takeout) I was a little undecided about coming to a restaurant that I'm not used to eating from, looked at the stars and seen it was a four-star,- so I decided to give it a chance. I have to say it wasn't bad I enjoyed my lunch very much. Customer service could've been a little more polite. So that's why it's getting a four star..!  I would definitely order again the food was delicious."}
{"text":"When I'm looking for a quick Asian bite, I come here.  If I have time, I'll head to AsiaTown or the west side,  but in a pinch, their Pho is good.  I like their pho. I think it flavorful and reasonably priced. Their apps, however, are pricy for what you get. I really enjoy summer rolls and theirs just falls flat. To top it off, they don't have peanut sauce! As for their fried apps, the portions are small and are fairly bland.  Their Pad Thai is mediocre at best. The flavor is nice, but the chicken is oftentimes overlooked.  The two things I really like about this place are the staff and the boba tea slushies.  The staff is incredibly friendly, on top of things and will check in on you. The boba is tasty! They buy the good powder, so their taro and honeydew are amazing!"}
{"text":"The BF and I came here for dinner on our first night in Cleveland Heights. We're staying at an AirB&B right up the street, and I used Yelp to find out about the restaurants around us. Pho & Rice stood out because of good reviews and our love of Pho.   Upon arrival we were seated immediately and handed our menus. After perusing the menu, we ordered an appetizer of 'Gyoza', fried dumplings, the BF ordered a bowl of 'Pho Tai', a Pho with rare steak, and I got 'Pad Se-ew', a Thai noodle dish with chicken, as it had been a while since Id had the dish. All 3 were excellent. The Gyoza were crunchy and flavorful, and as for our entrées, the BF said \"this Pho is f**king awesome\", and I couldnt stop eating long enough to answer.   We also both ordered a Thai Iced Tea, which were perfectly sweetened.   Easily a 5/5 restaurant that we will come back to. Its not easy to find good Pho sometimes, and Id love to try out some of their other dishes. Not to mention we both really want to try their boba tea to see if its any good."}
{"text":"Stopped in at P&R for a quick lunch.  Located on Coventry near Mayfield, P&R is a small place, although a bit bigger on the inside with about 9 tables and some window seating.   Bright orange walls and a bit of decor give it a cheery feel.  The menu is got a good amount of choices, at lunch time the prices are about $1 cheaper; so reasonable but not cheap.  I ordered the shrimp noodle soup, got a large bowl of rice noodles in broth with a good helping of nice sized shrimp.  Of course you get a side of sprouts, jalapenos, lime wedges and herbs to customize the dish.   The standout of the dish was the broth; complex without going over the edge with just enough body to warm you up.  The noodles and shrimp were very good as well, about the only thing I would have liked was some vegies.  Overall a very satisfying winter lunch, although it did run $10.  If you are in the area and need a Pho fix its a good place to go."}
{"text":"Their pho is delicious! Plenty of meat. Only reason it's not 5 stars is their fresh rolls are not the typical fresh rolls with shrimp, mint, vermicelli, and lettuce. It's more of a salad in rice paper. I love fresh rolls too, but not those."}
{"text":"For those days when I don't feel like driving to Asiatown to get a good bowl of pho. The prices are slightly higher, but the quality is good and it always hits the spot!  Be sure to try the complimentary candies laid out by the cash register. They're so good!"}
{"text":"Woohoo! Finally a place to fill your pho cravings in Cleveland Heights.  I came here on a cold day to do just that, and was pleased with what I got. The service is friendly and fast, pho was good but not amazing, and prices were reasonable (although a couple dollars more than you'll spend in Asiatown).  If you really want the best pho around I still stand by my long documented love affair with Superior Pho, but if you're in this area and don't want to make the drive downtown, stop at Pho & Rice and it will still hit the spot. I know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the hot and sour soup.  It is not like anything I have had.  The broth is not think as it is in the Chinese restaurant version.  It is more tangy and sweet that spicy and I like the fresh broccoli and ground chicken combo.  I am looking forward to trying the pan fried noodles; customers next to me had them and they looked awesome and I also want try the classic chicken pho.  The red curry noodle was good too but ask for spicy if you like medium heat. The crab rangoon here was very average and I am surprised it is so popular.  I would like to try the crispy spring rolls and maybe wings as well.  I like that they have a diverse menu even though its a small place that seats about twenty people.  Parking is available in a close by garage at 50 cents an hour.  Service is nothing fancy but was efficient and casual."}
{"text":"My fiance and I moved to Cleveland Heights back in August 2014. We checked out the area and wanted to try all the restaurants on Coventry. I had never had Pho before so I was a little nervous to try it. However, after the first time we went I became obsessed and now we loyally go. The employees are extremely nice and even remember our orders and that we always sit in the same spot. P2 is my favorite, it is filling and super tasty. If you haven't been there yet I would definitely check it out and if you have any questions feel free to ask the staff because they are happy to help.   The ambiance is also very inviting and personal. It is a happy little place to spend a meal and will keep coming back.   P.S. grab the candies at the register...they rule."}
{"text":"Great pho! The broth here is one of my favorite pho broths - very savory. Wish they had brisket as an option but it seems like few of the smaller pho places do. Lunch prices are a few bucks cheaper than dinner - it's a great place to stop in on a weekend."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I felt right at home at Pho.  Everything on the menu could be made vegetarian, and even several of the dishes could be made vegan.  The overall atmosphere of the restaurant was very quaint, clean and up-to-date.  I liked the fact that it was painted cool, inviting colors as well.  Overall just a great little place on Coventry.  Price-wise, prices were just about in line with all the other local area restaurants, with quite a few options overall.    As other reviewers have stated, the service was very good!  The server, who also had cooked our meals (and is one of the owners), demonstrated with her few other coworkers a very friendly and adept service.  They all pitched in which I liked, which isn't typical of most restaurants (where everyone has their one specific duty), and I felt very at home.    Now onto the food... I ordered the Spicy Basil, and it lived up to its name; quite spicy!  Very tolerable, but at a level of 2 out of 3 I was pleasantly surprised to get a good level of heat.  Also as other folks have stated, food was in general a bit on the sweet side, which in my dish mixed very well with the spices.  The owner made let us know they can tailor pretty much any of the meals to add or take away spice, sweetness, etc.    I plan to go back for sure, and am even arranging an event there for the local Cleveland vegetarian meetup group.  Thank you Pho!"}
{"text":"I walked into Pho and Rice last night not knowing what to expect. I had encountered mixed reviews from friends and on Yelp.  To start, my friend and I shared the fried tofu appetizer. It was crispy on the outside and soft on the outside, and went well with the sweet and sour peanut sauce that came on side.  Although I came here with the idea that I was going eat some pho, I branched out and ordered the P10, Hot and Sour soup as per the recommendation of our waiter. I am glad I did because it was delicious! It wasn't spicy (as you would expect from the name), but it had a tangy, aromatic flavor, and was filled with noodles and ground chicken. It was so good that I finished my entire bowl. My friend ordered the P1, beef pho. While I didn't get to taste her dish, she said that the broth was flavorful on its own and she didn't need to add any of the basil, jalapeno, or sauces that came on the side.  I did notice that the portions here are smaller than other Vietnamese/pho restaurants I've been to, but is about the same price. And while it is quite affordable, you do not get as much for your money here. That being said, I thought that the quantity of the size \"small\" bowl was a perfect size for dinner.  The service here was very prompt and friendly, and we were in and out in probably 35 to 40 minutes!  Pho and Rice is a great addition to Coventry! I know I'll be back to sample what else they have to offer!"}
{"text":"This is not the best, cheapest, biggest, or fastest pho in Cleveland. However, it *is* the closest (to our apartment) and I am so glad they are here on Coventry. When we want a quick and fresh lunch, Pho & Rice is a great choice. The staff is friendly and the space is airy and light.  The food has gotten even better now that there is some time since they opened."}
{"text":"Okay I'd like to preface this review by saying that I got takeout here and will be reviewing the Banh Mi specifically.  As a whole this place is pretty small but very bright. The workers were very pleasant and I only had to wait 15 minutes for my order to be ready. I ended up wondering Coventry a bit as I waited for my Banh Mi to be ready. On the menu I believe it was listed as the \"Vietnamese Sandwich.\"  I understand that there are variations to Banh Mi's across the board depending on where you go but I have to say I'm not a fan of this version. At least it was only $5.95 and I wasn't remotely hungry after. The good part about it was the bread - it looks like a French baguette but I'd argue it's a bit lighter, as it should be. It was flaky and not too thick so the bread-to-filling ratio was perfect. My problem was with what was inside and the overall flavor combination.  So a basic Banh Mi will normally have pickled daikon carrots, cilantro, sliced jalapenos (often de-seeded so it doesn't burn that much), sliced onions, some sort of meat and pate spread on the bread itself. There may also be some sort of mayo. The version with the grilled pork, called Banh Mi Thit Nuong, is one of the most popular choices and frequently on menus at Vietnamese places. This place does this particular sandwich differently. Now while different doesn't necessarily equate to bad and there are numerous variations of Banh Mi sandwiches out there, I was not a fan of this particular incarnation.   Their version has the daikon carrots and the sliced jalapenos. However it's missing the sliced onions and I didn't get any taste of cilantro. Instead there's slices of cucumber as well as greens such as spinach (I think this is the first time I've seen spinach on a Banh Mi). The grilled pork is cut into bits and I was pretty disappointed with it. The pork wasn't flavorful at all. A large part of why I love grilled pork on my Banh Mi is because of its flavor, both the marinade and the charcoal-y taste. This pork seemed to have little of both. There were also only a few smaller pieces in the sandwich. The sandwich has no pate and is instead rounded out with a sort of sweet mayonaisse. The sweet mayo is listed on the menu as part of the sandwich and I could get behind it but it seemed to drown out the taste of everything else. I don't know if it was the strength of the mayo or the amount on my sandwich in particular but it drowned out the taste of the pork, what little there was, the cilantro and the pickled flavor of the veggies.   Overall the sandwich isn't bad but it definitely wasn't the comfort Banh Mi that I was looking for. I'd like to come back and try something else off of their menu in the future and see if it was just this one miss for me."}
{"text":"Delicious! The mango salad was super yummy. It had a lot of sliced mangos though. Like a lot! which pleased me because I love love LOVE mangos! haha their crab rangoons were flippin amazing and I'd recommend those to any rangoon junkie. the way they were served - super chic. My girlfriend got the pho and loved it too! nothing disappointed us. Very cozy and friendly here. Definitely will go back and recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"I come here all the time! The crew here is so sweet and welcoming. You don't have to wait long for your food and they are always there to get whatever you need. The beef pho is my absolute favorite comfort food and it tastes AMAZING. You must try it!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  My friend and I came here after work to grab a quick bite. The restaurant is located towards the end of the street, across Pacific East. (If you aren't paying attention, you probably won't notice the new place. It took over an old sandwich shop.) We shared a papaya salad, and rare steak pho. The papaya salad was very good and refreshing. It had a good kick to it, but still had that wonderful mix of citrus, saltiness, and sweetness. The rare steak pho was ok. I prefer more thinly sliced meat for my pho. The soup base was not bad, but not the best I've had. It was a bit sweeter than most soups I've had. I also got the milk tea boba. The boba was a bit hard, which I didn't really like. The milk tea however wasn't bad. The service was great, our waitress was very kind and very patient. The place is clean, and presentation of our food was nice (better than most Asian places that plop the food/plate in front of you :p). Overall it was a nice place to eat. I would probably stop by here on days when I'm feeling lazy, and don't want to drive very far. It's close and convenient for students living nearby and has good service. I'll definitely try this place out again, and order other dishes I haven't had yet."}
{"text":"Walked here after getting a haircut at Eddy's after being recommended to try it and it was incredible. Had the pad Thai and was one of the best pad Thai dishes I've ever had!"}
{"text":"This is my go to Pho restaurant in Cleveland. Great pho and delicious bubble tea and quick service."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. Order the rice w/grilled pork....smh. Not a good quality of pork used. Rice was not flavorful, pork was grilled. The fish sauce was helping a small portion of the meal, until I bit into something with the consistence of a small ROCK. Spot everything out and tossed my $10.95 - lunch. Portion size was more on the $5.95 side. I scored it a 3 star - b/c of the mango sticky rice & only b/c of the mango sticky rice."}
{"text":"5 stars for the Curry Noodle bowl. It's chock full of veggies, has a great curry sauce, generous portion size so you could share or bring some home. 3 stars for everything else I've had there. Quite meh on other items, but the curry noodle bowl is out of this world. I've always gotten the curry noodle bowl with tofu but I'm sure it's good with other proteins too."}
{"text":"Good and quick food. If you want super authentic pho and the best pho in Cleveland, I'd head to Superior Pho, but Pho and Rice is also tasty and has a wider variety of options.   They make a mean crab rangoon and the hot and sour soup is definitely a star. I also really like their iced coffee bubble tea. There are a ton of bubbles and I like how it tastes a bit more like coffee than condensed milk. My friends ordered taro bubble tea, which I don't always see and which made me pretty excited. If you haven't had it, I highly recommend trying it. It's like lavender milk!   Overall, very solid pho options and a good place to come with a diverse group because of all the non-pho options, such as pad thai and various other noodle based dishes. The service is quick and staff is friendly, which is always a plus in my book."}
{"text":"Nice spot for takeaway in Coventry. This was our second spot we tried for Thai and is the one we'll be returning to. Food was prepared quickly and is reasonably priced. Gyoza were delicious and the drunken noodles was tasty and the veggies were still a little crunchy which made them taste fresh. The curry noodles were good though a little blander than expected."}
{"text":"Great food. Hearty. Good for these brisk cold days in Cleveland. Coventry is unique. This place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I will never go there again!!! I'm from California waited 30 minutes an my food still didn't come out!! The service is so garbage!!!"}
{"text":"The wife and I love this place. Very nice people and consistently delicious food. We have been making special trips here from the westside for a few years now.   Typical order either starts with gyoza or crispy rolls. The crab Rangoon always looks good too so maybe next time.  Vietnamese sandwiches or bahn mi follow. These are the best in town if you ask me and the reason we come here. Crispy french bread and sweet cream mayo perfectly compliment the fresh veggies and grilled pork(or ckn if you so desire) I get taken away to Indian summers in San Francisco. Eating Dinosaur bahn mi on the hill in Alamo square park surrounded by hipsters and homeless.  They are hidden in the salad portion of the menu so make sure not to miss this delicious Coventry gem.  Beef pho for wifey and chicken pho for myself to top us off. Really good broth here as well.  I like to leave here with the potent aroma of basil permeating from my pores and chicken broth bubbling from my gullet.   Until next time Pho & Rice..."}
{"text":"Good place, close to home and cheap.  The Pho is on the sweet side, but that doesn't make it bad - it tastes really fresh."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic pho. Cute little shop with friendly and quick service. Perfect for a chilly day or a refreshing Thai iced tea on a hot summer day. Reasonably priced. Definitely a great place to stop while you're in Coventry!"}
{"text":"The people who opened this restaurant used to work at the Thai restaurant across the street, back when it was called Mint Cafe and tasted a lot better. So, of course, we had to try both their Vietnamese food and their Thai food before we could properly review this.  Yes, they definitely have Thai food, listed under their specials.  Vietnamese food: We tried a rare steak pho and a combo (pork+shrimp) vermicelli.  I liked the pho broth - a bit sweet but a good mix of spices.  I'd give it a five if I was judging them solely on their broth.  The noodles were undercooked - they improved over time as they simmered in the broth.  The meat was overcooked and tasted a bit tough.  The vermicelli was done well but lacked flavor and needed a lot of the sauce (even more than they provided us).  Thai food: This was, unfortunately, kind of disappointing.  We had a pad thai and a pad see ew.  The pad thai was on the sweet side and the noodles were kind of sticky.  They did, however, give us some extra shrimp, which we liked.  The pad see ew noodles (the flat rice noodles) tasted almost... cakey.  We didn't finish this one.  The service was great and lived up to the Mint Cafe standard.  It's a small restaurant so it isn't difficult to get people's attention.  The prices are pretty comparable for the pho but the vermicelli is more expensive.  The hours here are better than a certain other local pho business, so all in all, this is a decent alternative to satisfy a Vietnamese food craving.  But most of the time, I'll still be heading over there."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant hidden in Coventry. Everything was amazing and fresh! Their bubble tea and bahn mi was one of the best I've had in a long time!!!"}
{"text":"We had pork chop and Pho - and the reviews were mixed.   I enjoyed the pork chop with rice but my companion told me that their Phos had \"no taste.\"   Perhaps it lacked salt but the description was \"like water\" and not soup.   In any case, I know that I would go back but definitely will not order the Pho."}
{"text":"I've had the Drunken Noodle and Pad Thai here, both made vegetarian, and I love them. The staff is always quick-working and very polite. They remember me and my partner each time we return, which has been embarrassingly frequent. I appreciate the extensive vegetarian accommodations and the album of Lady Gaga covers that popped up in the music rotation the last time I was there."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me an order of Pho Ga when I had the flu! The fresh veggies and broth were just what I needed! Its now a favorite and I recommend it to all!!"}
{"text":"Pho and Rice offers quite a bit more than the name suggests, but whenever I'm on Coventry, I stop by for the pho. They have some Thai and Chinamerican options as well, but I haven't been bothered to try them.  I usually order the first pho on the menu, because it has the most meat in the soup that the restaurant offers. The broth is incredible, but the potential is held back by a few things.  It's baffling not to see them offer meatballs or tendon as meats that you can add. Both rank pretty highly in my preferences, so it's unfortunate to see their absence take away from the texture of the soup. Tendon really makes the difference for me.  I also feel like they tend to skimp on both vegetables and meats. The vegetables come out in a small L-shaped dish, and I only get one lime, a tiny sprig of basil, about a handful of sprouts, and a few slices of jalepeños. The meat that comes in the bowl doesn't even cover up the noodles. At the end of the day, paying $9.95 for a large is a bit absurd, in my opinion.  Regardless, the quality of the broth and everything that goes into your bowl is unmistakably good, and ultimately why I keep coming back when I'm around. I really wish they offered a bit more, though."}
{"text":"One of my favorite take out places. The food is fresh.. The portions are large.. Usually get the Udon noodle soup with a protein. Always tasty, the broth is very savory and has a nice flavor. I also get the fresh rolls with shrimp. Not the best ive ever had, but very good for the area. One day i will actually eat at the restaurant but for now will continue to have the delivery guy bring it to me!"}
{"text":"Consistent with both food and service. The portion sizes are generous and the food is always prepared quickly. The staff are extremely friendly and create a very welcoming atmosphere in the restaurant. Their pho is a great deal and really great quality!"}
{"text":"We sat at the counter in the window and it was a great view with good people watching. Also got watched by lots of people passing by on the street taking menus that are outside the door.  Variety on the menu and quick service. I enjoyed the Udon pho (veggies + egg), large enough serving to have some to take home with me.   Nothing phenomenal, but great addition to the food options on Coventry. Will be back I'm sure!"}
{"text":"Let me just say I've eaten Pho & Rice a bunch of times. It's fairly close to my house and is a nice runner up to Superior Pho when I don't feel like trekking downtown. Anyhoooo, wanted some pho in this subzero Cleveland day and was sad to see that pho isn't an option for delivery through SkipTheDishes. Um, PHO! It's in the name and it's not an option? That is a really stupid decision made by the owner according to the Skip representative I reached out to. If you want to brave the elements and check this joint out, do! I give the pho tai a solid 4, Bahn mi and solid 4, and service a 4+. Giving the lack of ability to actually order pho through Skip a 1."}
{"text":"Very tasty noodles and pho soup. ----- ------------------- Try their Taro Bubble Tea!  Amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"My first Vietnamese food experience in Cleveland! I ordered spring rolls and chicken pho. I have little to compare to, but it was delicious! It came with lime, jalapeños, basil and bean sprouts on the side, and was very filling. I skipped breakfast and had lunch here around 12:30 and was full after eating, but if I hadn't skipped I probably would have had leftovers to take home. It was pretty inexpensive for lunch, only $8 for pho and I would definitely go back if I was in the area. It's a small restaurant, and I noticed they do online orders- something to consider if you are passing through!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Pho and it was quite tasty. The bean sprouts, basil, lime, and jalapeño were all very fresh. Service was a bit...lite, which would be my only constructive criticism. The servers should check on the tables just a little more often. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"BUBBLE TEA IS SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE SHOULD TRY AT LEAST ONCE!              I really enjoy Pho & Rice!  The menu might be a couple pages but it will have you really contemplating what you're in the mood for and look over the noodle or rice combinations.  I personally love any of their noodle dishes involving beef or pork.  That's just my taste.  The portion sizes are larger than what you would expect and getting the larger portion will almost ensure you're taking some home (maybe, maybe not).  What you NEED to try though with any meal is the bubble tea!  Bubble tea is a chilled, smoothie like tea with chewy tapioca seeds in the bottom of the cup giving the beverage a unique look (and taste) along with a wide straw to bring the tapioca seeds through the straw.  It's a dessert and beverage in one!        Overall, Pho and Rice is a small restaurant that I'm giving 4 stars to.  There are only about a dozen tables but in my travels and experience, the smaller places really do impress me.  The issue with a smaller restaurant is privacy for your table as it can become crowded fairly quickly.  This also adds to the wait times.  What could be an issue for some people is parking on Coventry Road. BRING QUARTERS!!!  You have to pay for parking almost anywhere you go in this area so I do recommend the parking garage across from Big Fun.  All of this combined still makes the trip and effort worth it as I have enjoyed every visit to this restaurant and look forward to the next!  I will be back!  Sooner than later!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! Not quite as good as #1 in Asia town but almost as good. And a lot closer to where I live and opened later. Everytime I come I swear I'll try something new but always end up with rare beef pho! It's that good! It's cheap and is served quickly! It looks like a hole in the wall but it's worth a try."}
{"text":"I come here whenever I get the chance to - whether it's a windy day, a rainy day, or just a long day.  The portions are amazing and so is the food. Absolutely great. The only issue my friend has is that they don't accept AmEx cards, but that doesn't affect me much.   They do have unique afternoon hours, though, so be mindful of that!"}
{"text":"Pho is one of my favorite dishes. I have been to Viet Nam 2x and live in SF so have experienced quite a lot of it.  This pho ga ranks in my top 5%! The broth is extremely tasteful and chicken is good. I have only 1 complaint and hence 4 stars and not 5.   Although someone on here stated the portions were large I found them a bit small for the price. In SF there are a lot of competitors so that could be why they give you smaller portions here. And the sides they give you for the pho are a bit on the smaller side also. But no worries- just ask for more.  I will definitely return many times when in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Claimed that they sell bubble tea, but I had the pleasure to drink the worst bubble tea in my life. Also the food was just mediocre"}
{"text":"I had never had pho before but enjoyed it. My girlfriend had eaten at a pho pace in San Francisco and said that it was better than Pho & Rice, but I have nothing to compare it to."}
{"text":"It was okay. Satisfied the pho fix but had only a limited types of pho. Service could be better."}
{"text":"The only reason I can't give this a five is because Superior Pho exists. I am slurping down a giant bowl as I write this and I am so happy. Their broth is mysterious and tasty, the space is bright and inviting, and the service is impeccable. I mean, I forget my manners when I'm here. So happy this is in my hood."}
{"text":"I'm a recent CWRU alum and have been going here ever since they've opened. The staff is extreme friendly and welcoming. They even gave me a free meal once since I've been there so many times. Ideal for college students due to their low prices and fast service. Also, this restaurant is perfect for a cold Cleveland day. 10/10 times I always get their P1"}
{"text":"A Decent place for Viet-Thai cuisine. I was impressed with the portion and how fast the food came out. The taste of food is pretty good. I am not quite a fan of PHO here because the broth seems to be rich of msg instead of natural spices' flavor. The rest of the menu is good. My favs are beef/shrimp pad thai, chive pancakes, beef carpaccio, and tod mon. Jasmine green tea is the best here!"}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken pho has a very homely feel to it. Great for those cold winter nights"}
{"text":"Pho & Rice. What a name.  Ventured in here with some girlfriends one night, to try this place out. Looked at the menu...and saw half of it was Thai (I think the owners are Thai). Huh? I thought.  The papaya salad was relatively good. I ordered the thai basil chicken...and not spicy, and it just looked so....like a plate of chicken. The presentation wasn't that great. Others ordered the vermicelli and was disappointed.  So... did I like it? Meh, it was alright. Do I like Banana Blossom better? Yes, much much better. But due to location, I may venture back to Pho & Rice from time to time. But is it that great? Eh..... no, but it's decent? :P"}
{"text":"after last times rather disappointing visit, I decided to give it another try juat to be fair and today I am gonna give it a four star. we ordered papaya salad which was very refreshing. then I ordered grilled pork with the \"noodle\" option. it came with four slices of pork with salad on the side and some sauce - maybe it was fish sauce that you can use to mix in your noodles. it was very flavorful and I have to say that I was very very full in the end. definitely worth the money. the service was a little better than last time as well. the two waitresses were very attentive and they were so fast getting us the bill and giving us back the receipt. I was very impressed. I would still stay away from their phos cuz I was not sure if they actually made it bigger or better."}
{"text":"I been to this place so many time because the food are really good and this is my favorite place but the service are really bad. The waitress are very unfriendly, no smile, not even gonna ask something sometimes that are terrible. I will say just go to get some good noodle soup ans that is it."}
{"text":"The pho is pretty good, love the decor of the restaurant! Don't order their spring rolls they are hard as sticks."}
{"text":"I've order takeout from here on SkipTheDishes a bunch of times and have also dined in a bunch of times. I was sad to see their Pho options aren't on SkipTheDishes anymore, what's up with that?  Service is always quick. Place is on the smaller side, but I'm never waiting more than 10-15 minutes to get my food after I order.  I usually order the Pho and am in love with the Pink Noodle Soup. I get it almost every time. It has the right amount of everything and tastes great on a cold day."}
{"text":"While Superior Pho has the best in the city, Pho and Rice is where I go to when I'm craving pho, but don't want to leave the neighborhood. On my most recent visit (for take out), I actually decided to try something new and discovered that their pad tai is delicious, as well! I ordered the vegetarian version, which had just the right amount of crisp-tender vegetables and chopped peanuts. The tamarind sauce was a bit on the sweeter side, but that's just how I like it. Finished it off the meal with mango sticky rice, which they always execute perfectly. This really is one of my favorite restaurants for both Vietnamese and Thai!  A little bit of history- some of the young people who worked at the original Mint Cafe on Coventry followed the restaurant to Peppermint in Woodmere, before deciding to open their own place, Pho and Rice, back on Coventry. I love supporting independent businesses like this and you should, too!"}
{"text":"Dined at Pho & Rice once again.  Tried the Pad Thai, FANTASTIC.  HIGHLY recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of our favorite local spots.   Never tried the rice. The pho is good enough that we no longer goto superior pho or pho tai. Just not worth the drive anymore.   The shrimp fresh roll (spring roll) is good.   Broth may be a little salty. Ask for hot water and mix some in.   We frequent this spot about 2-3 times a month."}
{"text":"Best Thai-Vitenamese restaurant in town!   Papaya Salad is original Thai and always my first appetite everytime I was there. Hot and Sour soup is also my best favorite noodle in Cleveland area - it is not a vietnamese recipe but rather Thai. I would recommend you to explore \"larb\" chicken, you will find it taste and savvy. Trust me, I am originally from Thailand and these menus are genuine.   Friendly atmosphere sitting down and relax with your friends. I love this place and would give it five stars !!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. My wife and I often go into chinatown and eat at #1 Pho or Superior Pho. I don't think Pho & Rice is quite as authentic but it's very close. The Pho Tai is fantastic and the broth is extremely tasty. Best of all, there is no solvent smell like in that other vietnamese restaurant on superior.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is the real deal. I ordered pho ga for my kids, and on the recommendation of the waitress I also had pad see ew. Normally I would never order Thai food from a Vietnamese restaurant, but I was pleased with the quality of both meals. I am definitely going back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place.  It's just THE MOST convenient location for me to swing by and eat all the time.  I wish I could say the pho made me want to come back all the time -- and that I will not have to drive all the way to the outskirt of town to find awesome pho anymore.  But alas, can't say I'll be ordering pho here anymore.  I've never had pho that was soo sweet.  I don't know... I get that the \"perfect\" broth varies a bit from person to person based on preference.  But it's almost like this wasn't even something I would call pho.  It looked like it, but definitely didn't taste like it.  On the bright side, it's great service, very affordable, and right around the corner from me.  I'll probably end up going again on some random day when I'm hungry and too lazy to drive somewhere.  But I will search their menu to find better options than the pho.  ----------------------------------- Explanation of my rating system - 5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back 4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category 3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either. 2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it. 1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"Wanted a Bahn Mi so badly. This disappointed... Was very small. Pork was okay for seasoning, but incredibly overcooked. Such a sad sad sangie... 3 because I will go back and get something else and other items coming out of the kitchen looked great. Just feel I ordered the wrong thing this time."}
{"text":"I ordered pho and honestly, it is the worst pho I ever had in my life it's kind over priced, the pho with meatball  is $8.95 before tax, and I tasted nothing but salty. I also ordered babble tea and it's way too sweet. I won't come again!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from this place, it's the first pho place I've tried in Cleveland. I ordered the Pho Tai and the fried gyoza. The gyoza come either steamed or fried and were very crispy. The broth for the pho was delicious. There were plenty of beef slices and even though I ordered takeout everything was still perfect. Maybe next time I'll sit in!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I had takeout for my first time and the food was amazing! If dining in makes it better I'll definitely be there with an appetite!!"}
{"text":"Pho & Rice on Coventry is a tough place to review...  Based only on flavor, this place is probably a 4.  The food is quite good... I didn't want to stop eating it.  Therein also lies the problem... the portions here are way too small for the price.  I had some spicy dish with shrimp added for about $13-$14... pretty high for an Asian food place.  The flavor was right on, so the price would have been worth it except for the crazy small portion.  A small scoop of rice and a small scoop of veggies and sauce with 3 shrimp for $13?  Come on...  There is already a lot of Asian food on Coventry... I don't really see this place surviving without significant price cuts.  It's good, but not THAT good.  Sorry.  Won't be back."}
