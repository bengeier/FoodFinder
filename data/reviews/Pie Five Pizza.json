{"text":"Loved the restaurant atmosphere, employees were great, but pizza was eh. The whole 'a million toppings' gimmick is cool but the crust broke each time I went to grab a slice. Wasn't very impressed. Toppings were good, and of course, it was made very fast."}
{"text":"The food is just as great as a service I absolutely recommended but oh my god can we talk about the chocolate brownie oMG it was delicious! And as for the magic dust it tasted phenomenal"}
{"text":"First time in and I absolutely loved it!!! If I had the chance to put ten stars I would for the food and the working staff!!! Btw I'm a UPS driver and I'm always on the go and if you are also come here and get some of the best food in Scottsdale! You'll be in and out if your really busy thx again Pie Five!"}
{"text":"This little pizza place is so good! It was our first visit today & we'll definitely be back. Between three of us two pies were enough. I loved the Athenian & my fiancé & son loved the High Five. They were allowed to add as many toppings as they wanted, no extra charge. & the staff were friendly. Glad this place opened up in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Service was wonderful. I was not expecting an employee coming by to clear our dishes. And this happened twice. A team member even told us about their plans of expansion to Gilbert and some other areas. Then he have us a few bogo coupons for our next visit. Oh- and the pizza was delicious, too!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time here. The service was good, the gentleman that helped me did a good job of explaining how it worked and info about the toppings. I got the high five on wheat and subbed the pepperoni for chicken sausage. I also added caramelized onion, bell pepper and black olive.  Honestly, it was ok. The crust was kind of bland and yes, it's a wheat crust but still, bland. I think all the meat made it a bit on the salty side for my taste but other than that, I didn't think there was anything super special about it."}
{"text":"Awesome Pizza, great topping choices, awesome salads, Ginger peach tea amazing....Cameron was very helpful and very nice..........this was our second visit and will certainly not be out last (one hour drive for us, would love a closer location to the west valley)....."}
{"text":"awesome tasty pizza....going there again tonight"}
{"text":"Really love being able to go in an order a personal pizza just the the way I like it.  Had the thin crust (though you could choose deep dish, wheat or gluten free) and then added the toppings I wanted.  Loved the crust and the toppings were fresh and tasty.  Didnt have desert, but the brownie looked delicious too.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Not off to a great start.  Long wait and the crust was raw.  Had to re-bake the pie when i got home.  Hopefully they pick it up soon."}
{"text":"Perfect in every way! My favorite is the 'Athenian! with the thicker crust! Great tasting pizza. All the kids loved it!"}
{"text":"It's Subway for pizza!!!  And so very Delicious!  Quick yet personable service from the crew as they make you your own personal pizza. Fresh ingredients right in front of you to make it easier for picking what you want. Delicious desserts to choose from as well as salads. They have combos to choose from: pizza & salad or pizza & dessert. Both are very good. Bathrooms are clean and set up in a cool way too!"}
{"text":"the good- clean environment, friendly staff,l and an organized appearance.          the bad - where to start!! the food was absolutely terrible!!! I hate to be mean, but I definitely had better pizza at chuckie cheeses ! this place has a decent concept, but to put all the money into starting a business and then cheaping out on the actual quality of ingredients to me just does not make sense. also- it's one thing if you're going to have a staff full of teenagers, but at least train them to make good food. hands down- if you don't have tasty food, I can't see the point of having a restaurant.  we were so beyond disappointed on the taste and quality of the food."}
{"text":"Horrible food! The base had no salt in it.. Sauce was Okay tasting. Ingredients were not fresh at all. This morning I had food poisoning after my pie five pizza last night."}
{"text":"I love the fact that these are personal (super huge!) pizzas, so I can get whatever I want to one it! They have a plethora of toppings and sauces! It's so cool! Plus the sinks in the bathroom are awesome. Only down side they need to do numbers for their pizzas so you know if it's yours or not."}
{"text":"Been trying pizzas around town and this is a winner!! Love the cracker style crust and the generous toppings...what is the best part about this place - the STAFF! Karizma is a gem. What a beautiful lady she is - greeted us at the door, offered help with menu, smiled the entire time, came out and talked to us while we were eating- see how we liked everything! We will be back for a 6.99 pie anyway we want it - best price in town too! Hey they gluten free, deep dish, thin crust and wheat crust too. Have you ever seen ginger and peach iced tea - yep they have it - and one of those cool Coke machines with 100 diff drinks. Come in and get some of this! Salads and desserts excellent too."}
{"text":"Fast. Tasty. \"Gourmet.\"  Friendly employees. The pizza was flavorful and came out fast. Stopped in one rainy afternoon for a pie. I had received a coupon in the mail for a free pizza, no purchase needed! We already started out on a great note. The friendly counter guy walked me through the process and recommended the pan pizza. I am glad I listened because of the toppings I chose needed a thicker crust to hold up well. I was pleased with the selection of toppings. They also have a cool bread bowl for you to build your own salad with the cool selection of toppings. My pizza held up well to the quick drive home to much down. My pizza was crisp on the bottom and full of flavor. The quality of the ingredients shone through. I also got some very tasty iced tea to wash it down with. I also like that they have a loyalty club to earn free pizza.  Yes, my first pizza was free however I was impressed enough to come back!"}
{"text":"The latest trend in fast food is the Subway-style build-your-own places - and pizza in Scottsdale has fully embraced it, Basically, for a flat rate you get a personal pizza with your choice of toppings that is baked in a super hot oven within minutes. Pretty neat concept and a nice alternative to burgers and sandwiches, though you'd be a fool to expect high-end quality food - this is \"fast food\",  As far as the pizza is concerned, for this type of concept Pie Five is middle of the road (the pizza at Fired Pie is much much better). It's about on par with Domino's or a $7 frozen pizza, The crust is nothing to write home about and the ingredients are rather generic. What's sets it apart is the price - lower than the other similar places. The pizza is also 2' smaller, but regardless it is a good deal for a quick lunch. Like most fast food places you will not get a full satisfying meal/dinner, but for a fast bite for not a lot of $ it's a better alternative than McDonald's or Taco Bell.  Unlike the other similar concept places, you can choose from several crusts including thin, pan, whole wheat, and gluten-free. If you are looking for maximum food vs $ value, the pan pizza is the way to go, However, don't expect much from the crust, it is rather bland, Again Fired Pie, which is more expensive, has way better crust, Though it was heartier, I didn't care for the dry bland taste of the pan pizza (they should brush it with garlic oil before baking!) and preferred the thin crust which kind of reminded me of Chicago-style cracker crust pizza. As far as the rest of the pie - they offer the standard array of toppings, though less options than Fired Pie.  The restaurant itself is nice and clean, and the oven works well so that your pizza is baked very quickly and is never burnt or under-cooked, I haven't tried the salads, so my review is about the pizza only.   The staff there is VERY friendly and accommodating, however it seems like they aren't always fully up to speed on how things work there. One time the kid struggled with the pie itself, the other time it was the register that was an issue etc.. but - every time the manager fixed whatever the issue was (and there is an issue every time I go) and took care of me, So despite the slight chaos and lack of confidence the staff has, I'll give them an A rating for being friendly and at least giving an effort, regardless of results.  They have a loyalty program called Circle of Crust and that is definitely an area the staff needs more training on - or they have software issues that need to be fixed, It's never a simple process to collect your points! But, the silver lining is that they do stuff like \"double points\" days, which makes it easier to reach your free pizza - 5 visits vs 10.  If I had to compare with the other similar concept places in the area, Pie Five is about on par with Pizza Me (better service though; Pizza Me had terrible service) but it's not as good as the slightly higher-priced Fired Pie. What works here is the value - for the price paid, the expectations are met. Want a quick cheap lunch served by some really friendly and cool kids - try Pie Five. Want a better pizza and a slower-paced lunch - try Fired Pie."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time at Pie Five Pizza, and now I feel compelled to write a review since its been 5 stars consistently for the past 3 times that I've been here. The dessert bundle here which includes a brownie, your pizza with unlimited toppings, and a drink out of the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine is a great deal.  It's $9.99 The best brownie is the turtle one. So good!! Chocolate, caramel and pecans. Great way to finish off your personal pizza. It's a lot of pizza! It's not like Pizza Huts personal pan pizza. Much bigger. It's 7\". You get unlimited toppings for the same price ($6.99). The spicy marinara sauce is spicy by the way. The customer service is really good! They make your pizza in about 5 minutes it's a great place to eat. I like the pan crust pizza too! Lastly, I did like the customer service as well! Very friendly and polite! When you pick up your pizza they will ask if you want \" magic dust\". I always accept it as it's good! Try it! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"New place - so new that, while standing inside the store, the Yelp app couldn't find them, so I couldn't check in.  Fast casual 'chipotle-style' pizza concept.  They say right up front, 5 minutes from order to pie, so I started a count down timer on my phone and hit 'go' and smiled as I showed it to them while I ordered.  The bad - I ordered the thin crust - the crust is run through a roller, then rolled over with the spikey-roller-thingy.  Not my favorite crust style (cracker-like) - not bad, just not my thing - I prefer hand tossed (or even squishy-ironed dough-balls as they do at My Pie).  I ordered the \"High Five\" - this had meat, meat, meat, meat and meat, plus sauce and cheese as the toppings.  The guy making the pie really laid the toppings on.  I've got a friend with a pizza joint, and from talking to him about the business side, they're going to go broke if they keep putting this many toppings on!  (Can't believe the reviews that are griping about stingy toppings - they either have really odd expectations, or went on an off day - or maybe I was there on an off day?).  Anyway, the pizza was put in a conveyor-style oven.  Showed up cut and ready to serve with about 40 seconds left on the 5 minute count-down timer.  This place really is fast.  As nice a location as they're in, as large as they are, as nice as the buildout is, and as generous as they are with the toppings, that's really important, because they're going to need to do a lot of volume!  They have the cool Coke machine, too (which means Lime Coke for me!)  So, minus two stars for the crust, plus one for the toppings (they were good) and plus one for the very friendly staff.  Asked about Gluten Free options (important to our family now) - they have gluten free crusts, and they change gloves/clean surfaces/etc., so they understand what needs to be done.  Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Pie Five is a new addition to the Scottsdale Airport/ Kierland area which opened today.   The inside has a modern, though inviting warehouse feel -- tin lighting and stained concrete floors. If you have been to Fired Pie on Northsight, or My Pie near the PV Mall, this may all feel familiar and it should. All have have high temperature ovens that cook their pies in minutes.   Pie Five is slightly different. Here, instead of the machine pressed twelve inch thin crust, you get to choose between four different crust types. Also the pies are somewhat smaller, maybe 8-10 inches and they're all priced at $6.95 no matter which toppings you add or order.  Tonight the pies were free and we thought pretty good. Soft drinks are $1.98 and the dinner Salad was $6.95.   The two of us thought Pie Five Pizza was Three and a Half Stars and \"A-Okay\".  We will give them a try again in the near future, but they're off to a promising start"}
{"text":"By far one of the best pizza place ever! Great price for a personalized pizza with as many toppings as you want! Customer service is amazing and all the dough for the pizza is freshly made. If that's not good enough then I don't know what else would please you!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time to try it out and got the Athenian pizza (one of their pre-designed specials). It was very tasty and a reasonably healthy choice!  This one is made with their thin crust, which had good flavor and was nice and crispy coming out of the oven! The pie tasted very fresh, and was the perfect size for lunch. I would definitely recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"Good, quick, friendly service. Prices are reasonable. The restaurant was very clean. I prefer the thin crust over the deep dish. I would have lunch here again."}
{"text":"This pizza sucked, hardly and meats and veggies, had to ask for extra and still very limited.  All I was eating was bread. The pizza was very dry, had to ask for extra olive oil they only put 2 table spoons. Customer service was very bad, this place service was like McDonald's only worried about get getting that food out, no quality."}
{"text":"So this is the 3rd build your own pizza place we've gone to in the past 3 months. My kids and I enjoy them, it's our Friday night dinner usually.  If i have to make a comparison to the 3, I can't.  They all are all about the same to me. I had a coupon for Pie 5 so we came here on Friday.  Pizza was good, staff was great. It took a little longer to get our pizza than the other 2, which was no big deal to us. Pie 5 has 4 different crusts to choose from, which was cool and my youngest ordered the bacon cheesy breadstick, he thought they were awesome. Will I be back? I sure will and the manager made sure of that by giving us a couple Free pizza cards.....well played.   See you soon Pie 5!!"}
{"text":"I hope management is reading this! We love going to FIRED PIE in Scottsdale so we decided to try PIE FIVE their competition. I will not be returning to PIE FIVE! Entered PIE FIVE around 7:30pm. Get in line and ask for a deep pan pizza. The guy behind the counter says \"we are out\". So I'm like, ok well then I'll have spicy marinara with the thin crust. The guy behind the counter says \"we don't have spicy marinara here at the counter\". So what do you guys have? I basically had them make the pizza. AND then all of a sudden the people in line behind me got to order deep pan and spicy marinara sauce because 10 min later they were made. The containers that were not filled the guy was scraping to get last pieces of onion and other items to place on my pizza. Got BASIL?! empty container...then go to grab peach ice tea...empty nothing made. Don't come here they won't have ANYTHING or it won't be filled!!! Worst fast food pizza establishment. Oh yeah... The workers should greet you too and say hello when u walk in. That would also be nice."}
{"text":"Great concept and build out. Not so great product. MyPie blows them away!  It should be called pie7 because thats how long they need to cook it. I walked up and got my pie the moment it came out of oven. The first bite was luke-warm. The cheese not fully melted and the sauce cold. Guess i will continue to drive farther to MyPie. What a letdown. I was so stocked a concept like this was opening by my house."}
{"text":"This place should be called pie zero. They have some of the worst customer service I have ever seen. Not to mention the lack of intelligent people working there. The food is okay but the cleanliness of this place I also question. The cashier uses the same gloves he has on to handle money and to touch your food, gross!"}
{"text":"Good luck in a heavily saturated market you need to be doing it better than the rest, ingredients were not up to par with MyPie, Fired Up, 1000degrees. Humble Pie is hard to beat."}
{"text":"Cool concept. I had the thin crust with Tuscan marinara topped with lots of veggies. Fresh ingredients, great customer service, and reasonable prices. This will be my go to for pizza."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and even better service!  There computers went down right when where about to pay,  they took care of us and lunch was on the house! Coming again for sure!"}
{"text":"Dined in on Sat 3/25.  Place was empty at 7pm but a few people did trickle in during the hour we were there.  I asked if it was always this quiet and was told that they're quite busy during lunchtime.  We liked our pizzas and the service was friendly.  The restaurant was very clean.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Just okay. Threw half my pizza away.  Very heavy handed on the sauce, which lead to a soggy crust in the middle of the pie. The dude making it wasn't very friendly and was rushing us along.  My wife's spinach salad was okay, but only because she added different toppings. The price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the customer service here is out of this world. They really want your business and are great at showing it. The dinning room was very clean too. It is a bit confusing having two \"subway style\" pizza places right next to each other. Pie five and eclectic pie and different and literally back to back. The pizza for me was average. My crust was a little under done, but still a decent pie. Price was nice too!  It's a really neat concept."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza here. So did my husband and 7 year old. I see a few mixed reviews and someone who said the pizza was bland but you know, it's really what you pick to go on it. There are so many choices. I had a pizza with marinara sauce, spinach, mozzarella and ricotta, Canadian bacon, green olives and then sprinkled with basil at the end. It was excellent. I also had a piece of my 7 year olds pepperoni pizza. Their pepperoni is really good. She gets her pizza without cheese and I thought I'd share that the girl working there let us know that they do have vegan cheese available. We also got gluten free crusts for our pizza which was one of the best gluten free crusts I've had. Better than Spinato's crust. And this is just a fast casual restaurant, and they nailed it.   Service was helpful & friendly. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great pizza !!   If you have a coupon to redeem make sure to have it ready.   We will deifnetly be back :)"}
{"text":"Amazing that you can add as many toppings as you want with no extra cost. You don't see that anywhere.   Stay away from the brownie though- tastes only of cinnamon. :(  As for the pie, the \"classic\" crust can support a lot of toppings. I'd suggest it!"}
{"text":"Had a Groupon for $6 for side salad, Pizza and a drink. Even at the regular price of 10.99, more food thanI could eat.  Excellent Caesar salad, good classic pan pizza with lots of options for toppings and drinks. Place was empty in the middle of a beautiful Saturday afternoon but I would try it again for lunch or early dinner after shopping at Kierland."}
{"text":"New business on scottsdale rd! We went here last weekend. The service was great and the pizza was fresh and fast! I had the meat combo and my bf had the farmers market pizza.  They were both delicious and made to what we wanted custom on the order.  The only thing missing here is beer.. I hear it's great with pizza. Idk, but they will have wine soon too!  Yay! The atmosphere is great, decor modern,  and pizza that is fresh and ready in 5"}
{"text":"Pretty decent pizza.  I had one with chicken and alfredo sauce that was great.  My husband had the Greek one that look very yummy.  I think you can get as many toppings as you want, but we decided to get an already built recipe, which was not bad.  They have lots to offer, breadsticks (different flavors and combos), salads, and dessert.  They even had a kid's pizza (I imagine is very tiny).  All and all a decent experience and would love to visit again and try a different recipe or make my own. :)"}
{"text":"We were excited to find Pie Five in Scottsdale after moving back to the area from Texas. In Texas we had Pie Five everywhere. What I love about Pie Five is that you basically can make your own pizza the way you want it. It's not anything fancy - but it's an easy place to take the whole family that isn't too expensive or a great place to grab a quick lunch."}
{"text":"This location just opened.  As part of their kick off they gave echo person that came in last night a free pizza!  They also donated to Phoenix Children's Hospital a portion of all other sales!  This was a class act in my book.   Now about the food.  The pizza was tasty.  The set up is simple.  All pizzas are personal sized 12\" perfect to share if you wanted.  You pick your crust, (whole wheat and gluten free options available) your sauce, your chesse and then your toppings.  The best part is they don't charge you extra for the amount of toppings you pick. It was awesome!  The salad was very simple but not disapointing, besides the pizza is the obvious star.  The pricing was mind blowing.  The pizzas are only $6.99 with as many toppings as you choose, $2.99 to add the salad, did I mention you build that one too.  They even have cookies and brownies for dessert.   The staff was courteous and efficient.  They even put my extras on the house when they made a mistake ringing me, even though I didn't complain and was patiently waiting.  I would have gladly paid because I knew it was going to PCH but they wouldn't let me, again great customer service. Overall I think this is a great place.  I will bring my family back."}
{"text":"Awesome ingredients and very helpful employees who actually care about the place. Great price and rewards program!"}
{"text":"We've tried a handful of the fad \"build your own pizza\" places and this one was the lowest on our list. Their ingredients don't have a lot of flavor and the crust is mediocre. Their spicy marinara was so unbelievably spicy I couldn't taste anything other than the overwhelming heat, and I eat spicy things on a regular basis. Everyone in our party had coupons for free pizza and it wasn't even worth it. We will be choosing another establishment for our customizable pizza needs. The only plus was the Freestyle Coke machine."}
{"text":"Just opened! Actually this is a pre opening.  Pizza was great and fast! Nice sauce, no over-seasoning here! Will be back. 4 different crust choices!"}
{"text":"I usually don't like these kinds of places, but I loved their pizza! I built my own pie with the classic pan, alfredo sauce, chicken, spinach, feta cheese, mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese, olives and onions. Outstanding food, outstanding (and quick) service. I will be back!"}
{"text":"We popped in on a Sunday afternoon with a free pizza mailer. We split the pan pizza (A MUST) and filled it to the brim with Tuscan maranara, whole milk mozzarella, ricotta, Italian sausage, spinach, caramelized onions, garlic, and topped it off with a delicious swirl of basil pesto.   The employee making our pizza was fun and nice. When we couldn't decide between certain toppings, he reminded us that it's one price, so add all the toppings we please! And so we did.   They have one of those fancy soda machines. Husband made a gross drink with all the crazy flavors. He went back and got a regular Coke.   The pizza was effing delicious. We've tried a lot of the pizza places similar to this before, but this pan pizza was amazing. I'm stoked Pie Five is so close to home and work. And the back patio area is really nice at this time of year.   As we walked out, we got to meet the manager, who was really awesome. We also had to walk by the chocolate chip cookie pie and turtle brownie pie (think pizookie style). YUM!"}
{"text":"Not trying to be mean but it was simply forgettable. The staff was unorganized, it seemed that one girl out of six or seven employees did everything except ringing up the guests. The pizza was ok, and decor was boring at best.  I wish them luck but a manager that's observant is needed."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the fresh ingredients, friendly staff, delicious pizza and salad, and serving time! I could see this place getting crazy busy during rush times, so I enjoyed being one of the few customers that were eating around 3pm on a Monday.   The artisan crust is bomb.  Must try! The weird bread that comes with the salad is something I would pass on."}
{"text":"I went on the opening day because there was a buy one get one free coupon on, get this, Grindr. I shit you not.   I have a Fired Pie right out my front door and don't know why I even tried this.   Compared to Fired Pie, Fired Pie is a pearl in an oyster.  Pie Five is a piece of sand in the oyster, which I doubt can ever turn into a pearl.  Crust is gross. Toppings are not of the high quality like at any other pizza place.   The only reason this doesn't get only 1 star is because the day I went, everyone who was working there was very nice.   I've never been back, even though it's only a half mile from my house, and I doubt I'll ever be back."}
{"text":"Tiny little pies with anything you want however they're very chintzy with adding what you want. There was nothing really outstanding here I did get a whole wheat crust that was nice to have that available but the pie seemed slightly undercooked and I was just generally unimpressed to point I doubt I'll ever go back maybe if the price was five dollars each instead of seven"}
{"text":"Really good pizza at a great price. A lot of good crusts and ingredients to choose from. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Tried for a Saturday lunch recently with a Groupon deal.  Pizza & salad.  First thing I noticed when we walked in was we were the ONLY ones there at lunchtime.  And the pizza gal behind the counter looked like she desperately wanted to be somewhere else.    I'm inclined to go overboard with pick-your-own pizza so I decided to try the chef's special shrimp alfredo pizza.  Pizza gal reluctantly waited on us with the same level of disinterest - and managed to botch my pizza order (even tho it was their special selection).  Mgr came to save the day and pizza gal remade my pizza correctly.  Pizza tasted pretty good, but the thin-crust wasn't great, kind of tough and rather flavorless (and I am a crust lover).  Oddly the salad was quite good with a very nice balsamic dressing, far better than expected.   Dine in was good.  Décor was done with a good amount of $$ and care.  Interesting restrooms with some trendy new hand-dryer thingy I had to figure out.  Maybe during the week they are busy?  I hope for success here but there is a tremendous amount of competition in this market and Pie5 doesn't stand out for me."}
{"text":"Needed a quick bite with the kids after activities. The place is quiet and we were the only ones there so that made me nervous, but it is still fairly new. The 5 stars was from both my kids. I think it was more of a 4.   The staff was very very friendly. The kids loved creating their own pizza. The multigrain crust was thin and crispy. The kids loved the cookie desserts that came with the kids meals too.  The decor is cute and very clean. Another plus was the sink in the bathroom. Seriously, my kids loved the unique sink/dryer combo.  The place totally met my expectations. I'm sure we will be back for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and super staff! Their system was down so it was free. They insisted. Like that you can make your own."}
{"text":"We had never been here before and it was explained to us that it worked like Subway just with pizza instead of sandwiches. I don't eat Subway because I don't like how all the ingredients just sit out all day. Nothing ever looks really fresh to me. This place wasn't bad. It's quick, easy, and tastes pretty good. The place is super clean and the employees are awesome.   We ordered 4 pizzas and my husband and I were the only ones to get the spicy sauce. And we have been paying for it greatly. I'm not sure what was in it but we've both been buddies with the bathroom since. So my advice is skip the spicy sauce and the classic pan. It's cooked quickly and comes out a bit more doughy then we like.   I can see this being a good alternative to the typical every day fast food for lunch. We just won't be stopping in again any time soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, customer service was great as well. We will be back. Personal pizza was just the perfect size pizza for 5 us adults and we all got it customized to our liking"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The place is clean and the food is good. It's nothing AH-mazing, but I will definitely return. I like the club card - interesting feature for a restaurant. There's parking in front and back and 2 entrances which is nice.  The staff... lol... they seem to mostly be high school kids that probably snooze in class if you know what I mean lol, but they're working at least and nice so whatever."}
{"text":"This place is average. Good concept but the sauce is average and so is the crust. It is edible but nothing special"}
{"text":"I'm always down for a lunch restaurant close to work that won't cost me an arm & a leg. One of my co-workers mentioned this place as an alternative to Fired Pie, so I was intrigued. I'd heard good things about the company in general as there were store openings in my hometown back east. The layout is very similar to the order-down-the-line restaurant - start with the crust, sauce, cheese, toppings,put in the oven, etc.  I think my downfall from the get-go was ordering a personal pan pizza instead of thin-crust. Upon opening the to-go box at work [a ~3min drive away], I noticed my crust was fairly soggy - mostly cooked but not crispy as I like it which caused the box underneath to be soft. When picking up my slices the toppings consistently fell off, including the cheese. The pizza tasted decent, but nothing memorable, just kind of meh and undercooked. My co-workers too were not very impressed with their pizzas despite the thin crust they each selected..Word to the wise -- skip this place and go up the road to Fired Pie."}
{"text":"Processed dough... pizza wasn't even cooked through..... subway of pizza... sauce has a canned flavor... it was really bad... target Pizza Hut is way  better..or lesser of two evils... If I had four hands it would be FOUR THUMBS DOWN!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! I stumbled on this location by accident and it turned into a very positive experience!! Easily one of the best margarita pizzas I have had in a long time! Very clean restaurant, friendly and accommodating staff, plenty of seating! I got my pizza as soon as i finished paying..there was no waiting time and they were even quite busy! Very impressive!! Food was very reasonable priced as well!! I will be back as soon as I have a chance!"}
{"text":"First time going! Mellow mushroom had too long of a wait. Went to Pie Five instead. It was so fun to build your own pizza! My pizza was so good! Olive oil base, ricotta cheese, chicken, sun dried tomatoes, and pesto sauce on it after it was baked. Mmm mmm good! I'd go again for sure!"}
{"text":"Addicted to pizza so whenever a new joint comes into town, i got to try it.  Its the fast pie type place - build it in front of you and they make it real fast.  Loved how they have two types of crust - I had the pan (thicker). Crust was great!  I'm a boring ol' cheese pizza guy and I was impressed. Sauce was good, cheese tasted good. They put wayyyy too much sauce on the pie - i'll ask for light sauce this next time.   The dessert looked good as well but passed on it this time"}
{"text":"Just a quick review because really, with all the similar competition, I'm not going to spend any more time on this pizza. My photo is missing a piece because I wanted to taste it before writing and I was starving! Not any more... The employees were nice. VERY unorganized, but the place is new. The pizza crust was whole grain, but under cooked and basically about as flavorful as the box it came in. I asked for olive oil and garlic as a sauce and the pizza was soggy, so I imagine tomato sauce would make it worse. The toppings were all piled together in the middle of the pizza. They didn't really look very appealing on the line either. The meat all looked grey. There is a place right down the street that has the same concept and about the same prices but WAY better quality. Go there instead."}
{"text":"Another pizza \"Subway\" style place where you order a preselected combination or build your own personal size pizza.  All their pizzas are $6.99  Had the Deep Dish \"Create your own\" individual size pizza and a Margherita Pizza.  My wife and daughter ordered the Margherita Pizza which they used regular mozzarella, tomatoes and garlic with oil, then after it came out of the oven asked if they wanted basil on a thin crust.  I ordered the Deep Pan crust and selected the build your own pizza. I definitely got my money's worth by getting pepperoni, sausage, ham, bacon, meatball, olives and mushrooms. The pizza was pretty loaded and they had no problem with putting on whatever I wanted on it which was a pleasant surprise.   The lead worker was very helpful in explaining the process and menu, so we ordered, the pie cooked and they called our name to come pick up the pies.  The margherita pizza was not very presentable nor tasty compared to their competitors, needed a dab of pizza sauce but just did not look very tasty.   I was impressed that they offered deep dish and it was pretty tasty along with the massive amount of ingredients that were placed on the pie, I really liked the results.  Would not recommend the margherita pizza but liked the deep dish."}
