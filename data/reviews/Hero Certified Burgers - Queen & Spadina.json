{"text":"I love burgers. I had heard talk of Hero's so was looking forward to trying it out. I'm a little confused by the 'gourmet' burger description. These burgers are lower than your typical fast food burgers. If I'm going to have a fast food burger I will go to Harvey's, McD's, Burger King any day but I will never again eat this crap."}
{"text":"The best hamburger place I had in Toronto,I went there twice,the meat is juicy and thick and the soda fountain with all those choices is great also they had a veggie burger for my bro a bit pricey and I wish they had wifi but besides that all good,also they have sauces you can put on you're hamburger Which makes it tangy or sweet,the onion rings are good definitely a place I would recommend"}
{"text":"I've been eating at this restaurant on a weekly basis since it opened four years ago. Always a pleasure to chat with Penny & staff and have my regular burger. The place is sometimes mad but it's a great place for people watching. Clean, good food, great staff attitude. It's a burger place."}
{"text":"I ate here two nights ago and the food was so bad I threw up the next morning and could barely get out of bed the next day. Worst food I've had in years.

I dont do many reviews but this was so bad I had to do something."}
{"text":"Firstly gotta start by saying that I do not touch  fast food mcdonalds, harvey's, wendy's, bk or any of that crap...

I went to Hero burger for the first time since I can remember and I was very not happy.  I went there b/c I needed some food in me before going to a concert @ Horseshoe Tavern.  

Well I ordered the most basic burger and I took a bite and it tasted / felt like rubber, I took another bite and same thing..Gross! I looked inside the burger and I tell you, It did not look like what a burger should look like on the inside.  It was a light brown color and  didn't look like ground meat at all. looked like some sort of solid material (Meat glue maybe?)...I gave it to my friend to try and he too was appauled after 1 bite.  I threw it out and left.   

Will be sticking to Burger Shack (imo the best bang for your buck in the city that's turning burgers into a $15 affair...)"}
{"text":"I LOVE Hero Burger but everything else about this location just doesn't seem to work. They take longer than the average wait time and the dining area is disgusting half the time. I seriously love the food but rather go to another location."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with the burgers here. In my opinion they're just a small step beyond those from Wendy's or Burger King and far behind the best burger joints in Toronto.

The patties don't seem as fresh as they are made out to be. The look and taste of them reminds me of something you'd get out of a freezer from a supermarket and throw on a grill when you're too lazy to make your own.

The wrapper (shaped kind of like an onion) annoys me.

For just over $10 I got a six-ounce burger with fries and a fountain drink. I don't have any complaints about the price, but if I can get a better burger for a couple bucks more, it's worth it.

Inside, there's barstool seating for about eight people and roughly eight tables that seat two or four people. I was there for lunch and it was about half full."}
{"text":"First impressions of this place was pretty good but then I noticed that there was not a great deal of choice really. Was annoyed that there was a lot people just sitting about and not really buying food. Staff where really  nice tho!"}
{"text":"Now... Chicago has really upped its ante when it comes to halal burgers, so I may or may not be biased...

We came in shortly before closing time and our order was prepared fresh. The cashier got frazzled (we did have a large order and it was the end of the day) but she had to repeat our orders many times and still managed to get some things wrong.

The burgers were indeed good and fresh, although slightly overpriced (but because of the sustainable and socially responsible quality of the meat this can be understood)

Tl;dr? Burgers = good , slightly overpriced, not good enough to want to frequent the place, but fresh and socially responsible option that's open until late"}
{"text":"Du hamburger comme on aime !"}
{"text":"I normally really like Hero Burger, and I was very pleased when the cashier greeted me warmly and asked me how my day was going.  So far customer service was going really well.  The Loonie tip I gave when paying enabled the cashier to deliver my order to my table instead of having to wait for me # to be yelled out.  While the Burger was good, the Fries leaved to be desired.  While they were a dark golden brown and looked well cooked, they were soggy and flopped in half when picked up.  I like a nice crispy fry and this is normally a good place to get great fries.  I did politely inform the cashier who graciously offered to bring a complimentary replacement, but rather I had just wanted to have him talk with the cook to see if anything could be done for a future visit of myself or other custmers."}
{"text":"Fresh, Delicious and Healthy? Burger. However, I had to wait 8 mins for my 3 burger order. The fries were not so good. Overall, good place for dine-in."}
{"text":"The burger wasn't all that impressive.  For the price, I would want something much juicier, tastier, more flavourful.  I also found the menu a tad overwhelming.  I tried the Cajun chicken sandwich which was ok.  The fried zucchini came with a dipping sauce which was good.  Service was friendly and helpful.  The burger was worth 2 stars.  I'm bumping up to 3 based on customer service and the non burger items I tried.  

For burgers, I'm going to stick with BP across the street."}
{"text":"I've recently given this chain a second chance, having first tried the location further west along Queen, and I didn't like it much better than the first time.

You're paying Big Smoke Burger prices for a thin sliver above Harveys quality. Hell, I like Harveys and I'd preferred to have given them my business because I'd have gotten the same meal for about $5 dollars less.

The fact that their burger and side dish packaging is made from recycled material was nice to see but any green factor felt offset by the large screens constantly on above the ordering bar. The atmosphere isn't much different from the McDonalds on the opposite corner, just a different colour scheme and slightly larger ceiling really (and, to be fair, less crusty punk drum circles on the immediate sidewalk).

If you want to spend less money, go to that McDonalds. If you want to spend about the same or slightly more for a MUCH better experience then I'd recommend you hit up the BQM Diner that's only about sixty seconds further east along Queen."}
{"text":"-39 celcius and where can you walk in 5 minutes?

Ordered the wild salmon burger, got the sweet potato fries upgrade for a buck more and a soda, $14.50  Canadian. 

Good food, not greasy, decent taste fast food here.

Customer service: tops."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of different locations of Hero Burgers. I knew what I was going to expect but I still end up trying the burgers again. They do have great advertisement and they do look so pretty.

The verdict is... terrible burgers and the salmon burger my wife had was made with too much sauce - more like a sauce burger. The fries were half sized, which made them look like soggy leftover fries. And sure enough, they were soggy leftover fries. The burger itself, to be honest, tasted a lot like an A&W uncle burger, which makes me think that it isn't all angus meat.

You know what the truth is? I was hungry and didn't want to eat McDonalds. I should've went there. At least I knew what I was getting."}
{"text":"There's nothing more annoying than walking into a place with no line and having the guy immediately ask you what you want, when the menu itself is overly complicated.  Too many options to navigate and try and figure out which option costs what.  Also, I \"upgraded\" my combo to poutine but the surcharge they added on was more than the cost difference between fries and poutine itself.

The burger texture was too \"meatloaf\" for my liking... texture resembles sausage too much, too much handling of the meat itself beforehand.  Also, though there are a lot of fancy adjectives describing beef, at the end of the day the burgers are corn fed and not grass fed like cows were intended to eat."}
{"text":"A little pricey but I really like this place- yummy burgers and LOVE the ancho chipotle sauce and the Coke Freestyle machines."}
{"text":"I am completely on the fence with how I feel about Hero Burger at Queen and Spadina.

Let's start with the good.

I love that they really clearly list what sauces and items on their menu are gluten-free.  I also love that they have a (tasty) gluten-free bun and that they wrap the burgers made with this bun in different paper so you know you are getting the speciality item you ordered.  I also appreciated that the cashier warned me that were was the potential for gluten cross-contamination with regards to their fryers so I could make an informed decision as to whether or not I wanted fries.  It's really nice to be able to walk into a restaurant and order something armed with the knowledge that it won't make me sick.

The food itself, for \"fast\" food, is good.  The burger is very filling, the toppings are fresh, and I really like the fries.

Now, onto the bad.

You'll notice I put \"fast\" in quotes.  This place is busy.  Given the fact this location sits squarely on the SE corner of Queen and Spadina, a certain degree of busyness is entirely acceptable.  However, nothing ever seems to be done to compensate for the sheer volume of foot traffic they get through their doors every day.

There are disclaimers posted that mention that each burger is made to order so you may find yourself waiting a few extra minutes for your meal.  Fine.  I'm OK with that.  That being said, when there are 10 people in line having only one taking orders cashier is not good enough.  As a service-based establishment you need to put forth a greater effort to actually serve your customers.

One day I went for lunch and there was one person running the cash register, and two people standing at the (nearby) window bagging food and calling out order numbers.  Is there a reason that two people were needed for this task?  Why couldn't one of them hop on the empty register and start processing a few more orders.  If it takes 5 (or more) minutes from the time I place my order, I don't want to have spent 15 minutes waiting to place it.

The new mix-your-own pop machines are interesting in theory, but I find it just makes everything taste off.  I'd rather have a really good fountain regular Coke than a just-OK fountain Cherry Coke.

If you can get here when they're not experiencing a rush of customers, you'll likely enjoy the food and the experience.  If you work in the area and are thinking about popping in for lunch, I urge you to think again and go somewhere else to fulfill your burger craving."}
{"text":"Stopped in here one late night/early morning after realizing it was 24 hrs 

Tried to order one of the specials but they were missing ingredients so just ordered a burger and a poutine

The poutine was okay and the burger was okay as well

Burger experience here is largely dependent on what toppings you choose"}
{"text":"Solid place for burgers and sandwiches. They use 100% range fed, antibiotic free, hormone free ingredients. I've held several successful filming interviews here without a problem. They're open 24/7, which is weird for Toronto. The staff. Is friendly and knowledgable about the menu, especially Sonja. Salmon was delicious. Will de be back"}
{"text":"Was just passing by and was interested in trying something new.  A far cry from McDonald's that's for sure!  First noticed that they had 100+ coca cola varieties proudly displayed on their door.  Not sure if coca cola freestyle is featured at all locations, but it was pretty neat nonetheless.  Tried a 6oz. Hero burger and loved it. Will recommend to others."}
{"text":"Heyy ... I don't know why this place isn't gettin' any love!

It's NOT bad! 
While it's not Big Smoke or Burger Priest,   it's reliable and tasty. Much better pick over McD's which is across the street. 

Hero is a franchise, and I find the constancy of each visit reflects that. 

More expensive than other fast food, but it's a lot better.

The onion rings are yummy. And I love the 4lb burger with extra Hero sauce. 
I've had the poutine, and I liked it. The chocolate milk shakes are made with real milk and ice cream, and they're awesome."}
{"text":"They can \"certify\" their burger meat all they want, it still tastes horrible. 
Fries are too salty. 
Better than mcdonalds shoe sole burgers, but still bad compared to home-made burgers made from real meat."}
{"text":"I had the 4oz regular burger - it was fantastic!  I like a burger place that gives you choice of toppings and other options.  I appreciate that they offer a gluten-free burger bun.  The fries were only so-so."}
{"text":"I'm not a burger snob. I'm just a hungry gal at 10 pm looking for a good burger. Fresh, hot, quality burger. So when I looked at my options: McDonalds or Hero, I thought about it for a bit and chose Hero. Hesitation is because I really like the fries at McDonalds. But my hunger made the decision easy. 

Got the Hero Burger with cheese and I have to say it was DELICIOUS. Angus beef makes a difference. The burger was juicy. Gone in 6 bites."}
{"text":"Can I do negative stars?
Blown away with how bad it was. I was expecting beef, not something that was fat and oil with no sense of blood ever having been part of the structure of whatever animal this patty was made of. Let's just say once you see it, and notice it doesn't look like meat, you'll bite into it and confirm that it doesn't taste like meat either.
Tastes like the frozen beef patties that you get from a supermarket. Only redeeming quality of the place is that they have free refills with their pop. If you want a better burger, I'm sad to say you can find it at McDonald's of all places."}
{"text":"I've had the misfortune of eating here twice now - two different locations and frankly, one time too many. The veggie burger is peppery and not in a good way and aside from the pepper is bland, has an unpleasant texture and comes with a basic white bun. Who cares how many toppings you can put on when the burger sucks? I've had similar responses from friends and my bf with their meat burgers.

They even manage to screw up french fries - almost wet tasting, not salted, too thick for the lack of cooking. I don't know what to say. It's unfortunate they've paired up with and taken over all the Lettieri locations because it becomes one of the only late night options on some pretty prominent city corners."}
{"text":"I had walked by a bazillion Hero Burgers, and then finally one night before a show at horseshoe I found myself here trying one. Thankfully I ordered blue cheese on the burger, as that at least put it over the top a tiny bit. But as I ate it, I realized how lacking it would have been without the blue cheese. For the price it's not so hot. You'd be better off getting something at the Burger's Priest which is opening down the street. But really, I wouldn't say this was much better than a Harvey's burger and it costs more. I did like that you can order different size of paddies though. But I would pass on this place."}
{"text":"Actually, I would give this place a 3 1/2 stars if I could - because I've been spoiled! This is a relatively new chain of burger joints in Toronto. It was ok, but it was not The Works, and didn't hold a candle to Burger Revolution IMHO and for whatever it's worth. Decor is like a warehouse - a big wide open space that is not overcrowded with tables. We ate our food sitting in a window watching people go by."}
{"text":"This location opened recently, but is already busy - sitting on the always crowded intersection.

They work fast and even though there is a huge queue during a lunchtime, waiting time in my experience was within 10-15 minutes max.

The burgers themselves are so-so, and only a sight of McDonalds across the street makes one realize that there are worse things in this world.

It also annoys me when the fries' oil is not changed frequently enough to keep them at least looking fresh. Just my personal preference.

Overall, an ok lunch takeout. If you are lucky (or arrive before noon) there may be even a spot available for 1-2 persons to stay inside."}
{"text":"When I first walked in I immediately noticed the large menu selection and the really cool soft drink dispenser. However after I ordered a combo I was disappointed. I found the burgers very bland, and the fries over cooked and lacking 'kick'. The vanilla cherry coke was probably the best part of the meal. Prices are high here and the bill for two combos came up to about $25.00 (I could have had a great Korean or Chinese meal for the same price just down the street). Great name, and cool concept but this place is a dud when it comes flavour and value for your money. Furthermore an hour later I felt like I had a 10 pound rock in my stomach. If you have a burger craving, avoid this location!"}
{"text":"I was on a business trip to Toronto and went to Hero. The customer service was fantastic. The manager (female--I forgot her name) was very helpful as there many varieties & variations of their burgers. Great service and good burgers. I'm from San Francisco, so I am picky about food. I'll go to this place again because of the service, the place was super clean, and good burgers."}
{"text":"I am writing this because I am super addicted to their ONION RINGS!!!! I used to get Onion rings from A&W all the time, now since tried onion rings from HB, I completed stop eating  Onion Rings from A&W 4 months ago. 

Their Onion ring slices are wide,very lightly breaded, crunch outside and juicy tender inside. The batter has some onion garlicky , salty seasoning in it. They taste better without any ketchup since it has its own flavors already, unlike other onions I have had in other stores(like Pizza Pizza--yuk). They also smell good because of the salty onion seasoning on the crunch batter. Me n my bf religiously go back to get onion rings. 

I do not usually like Onion rings, when I go to Hero burger, I always order Onion Rings. It's only $299! You get a lot of it too and wrapped in a very cute swirl cute steam bum shape wrap.  

Any restaurant if there is 1 thing that stands out that their customer can say:\"I have had the best......of my life\", then this restaurant business is successful! 

I am thinking about onion rings right now that I am writing about it hahha.....drooling."}
{"text":"Walking into Hero reminds me of many oldie burger places in the US. Clean, white tiles. The only thing that's missing is a jukebox, but the Coke machine looks like one so it's almost perfect.

The burgers here are not that bad. I actually like them better than the burgers at Big Smoke Burger. The only thing is that there are too many options. Their menu lists out every single condiment, every single topping, etc. They have some pre-defined burgers, but they're not advertised anywhere except for the screens by the cashiers and the contents of the screen keep changing before I've had a chance to read it all.

So far, I have tried their Blue Moon burger (not advertised anywhere except for the screen by the cashier), which has yummy blue cheese and mushrooms, and the Salmon Supreme, which although I thought was tasty, I also thought it was over-priced.

The service here is very slow. They could use a few more cashiers and cooks given that the intersection is extremely busy."}
{"text":"Positive: Only place to get 100% hormone free, antibiotic free, range fed ANGUS BEEF!

Negative: Bland taste (needs some salt) with mediocre tasting fries.

Overall: The only place to find \"have it your way\" Halal Angus burgers.

Revisit:  Yes, to give them another chance (c'mon they got Angus Beef) and try their chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"2 stars, really????? I actually loved it here! This was my first Hero burger and it was amazing. I came here at 6pm, there weren't a lot of people. Agree that the 1 cashier isn't fantastic... in fact, there were only just two cash registers..

I had the hero burger with fries. Fries were all burnt. I enjoyed the mix-your-own drink machine! I had some... peach coke or something weird. Didn't taste great though.

My meal price was the same as a McDonald's meal and I think the burger at Hero is awesome. Other burgers at Hero are pricier..."}
