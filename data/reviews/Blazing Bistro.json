{"text":"Although the portions were decent sized, the quality was sub-par for the price. $27 for a couple sandwiches and a side of fries seems a bit steep. I had the pulled pork sandwich which was piled high, but the sauce had too much vinegar for my tastes. My wife had the Murray Hill Sub - a cold-cut sandwich on a sub roll. Nothing special - especially with a $10 price tag. The eggplant fries were interesting, however they could have been better a bit crispier."}
{"text":"I had high hopes but this place didn't live up to them.   The Wolworth's steak and egg was a fried sausage patty with raw, pink areas in it. I wasn't asked how the egg should be cooked. It was a light sunny side up with mostly runny white.  Ick. I don't recommend it.   The West Bank Mac and cheese with pulled pork was heated in the microwave and had flavorless buts of pulled pork, most likely from a plastic container. I don't recommend it.  They Murray hill sub was large and the lunch meat was good, but the bread was stale. I don't recommend it.   Others with us said the Caprese grilled cheese was good.   Overall this place isn't enjoyable and I would recommend you keep looking."}
{"text":"The veggie tacos at this place were insanely good, maybe the best tacos I've ever had.  The fries were good, and the hot dogs were good.  And also, I had to take my three-year-old inside to go to the bathroom before she ate her hot dog, and when I came back some seagulls had absconded with an ENTIRE hot dog...when I explained this to the person working at the truck, she gave me a new hot dog, free of charge, which I think is the definition of excellent service.  The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is it's a bit pricey, but you can't complain too much when the only other option when you're at the HOF is the inside concession stand, which is just as pricey."}
