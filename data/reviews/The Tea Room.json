{"text":"What a nice lunch for my friend and I!  Simple and casual, but oh so tasty!  Don't expect High Tea like at the Prince of Wales hotel.  A large selection of teas, very yummy scones and other desserts, and their curry-mango salad is very good.  No white gloves or fascinators needed to enjoy a casual tea here."}
{"text":"I purchased this a Living Social coupon for this place and thought I'd give it a try. My experience there was just okay. 

Booking a reservation was very confusing and frustrating. I went onto their website and booked a reservation for 6 people at 1:00 pm on a Saturday afternoon. I received an email back saying that that my request for reservation has been submitted and that they will not respond back unless they cannot meet my request. I booked this about a month in advance. Since I check my email everyday, several times a day, I am sure that I did not get a response back from them. However, upon arriving at the Tea Room, they told me that I do not have a reservation and that they emailed me to say that they can only accommodate such a large party at 11 am or 3 pm. Because I did not respond, they did not book my reservation. This is crap, because I never received an email from and when I asked the lady to show me the email, she had a hard time finding it. She didn't seem very apologetic either, she sounded defensive.

With that being said, they were \"nice\" enough to seat us outside on their patio. Their food was okay, but I thought it was a bit expensive for what it is, considering the quality. 

I'm also not a fan of their ALL CAPITAL LETTERS on their website warning people to call them if they are cancelling their reservations and letting people when they are fully booked. It's like they are yelling at their customers. 

Overall, I think their customer service could use some improvement."}
{"text":"When you think afternoon tea, you usually think of intricate china, pastries and finger sandwiches. A lot of places have elevated afternoon tea by adding sophisticated desserts, mimosas and champagne instead of tea but The Tea Room in Oakville has maintained the simplicity of this afternoon indulgence. 

You are more than liking to miss this little shop passing by as the shop front is very humble. It's certainly not a grand restaurant or a beautiful hotel and you'll be able to see everything with one quick glance when once you're inside. 

We opted for the Harbour Tea package and the first thing we got was the tea selections. With more teas than I could ever remember, the list was certainly fulsome. Remember to double check before ordering which tea are offered that day as availability may vary. I ordered the Vanilla Tea, which was very fragrant but not strong enough in flavour. 

Our first tier of goodies included their homemade dill dip with fresh veggies and an assortment of finger sandwiches. The fresh dill dip was delicious and as someone who prefers cooked vegetables to raw, I would have gladly ate more just for the dip. The egg salad and tuna sandwiches were tasty but nothing out of the ordinary. The highlight of the tier was definitely the cranberry chutney wrap and mango curry sandwiches. Both were so full of flavour but still light enough as an afternoon snack. 

The sandwiches and veggies were already quite filling but afternoon tea is not quite complete without the desserts. Even before the dessert stand comes out, you can smell the scones already. Although the plate itself doesn't look like much, the taste was enough to make up for it. The scones were crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. With a little butter or jam, it just melted in your mouth. The tarts were also delicious as well and the perfect portion for my sweet tooth without being too heavy. 

The Tea Room is located on Marine Drive in Oakville and the harbour is only a short walk away. I would definitely recommend planning a visit if you prefer a more low key setting to the higher end afternoon teas that hotels offer."}
{"text":"tried unsuccessfully to make a reservation here, you can ONLY BOOK online.  no one answers or confirms.  Voice mail and web site specifically says \"we will only contact you if we cannot accomodate your reservation\".  I received no email or voice mail and drove out there only to find it seats about 10 people, so cozy isnt the word I would use.  I had to climb over people to reach the counter. Proprietor only checks email once a day and is \"too busy serving\" to answer her phone.  you decide.
 Found a fantastic new place right across the parking lot however called the Brown Dog where we did enjoy a lovely afternoon tea, sandwiches scones and fresh whipped cream."}
{"text":"This shop is shut down, please update in the system accordingly, to avoid Yelp buddies get here for nothing. Thanks"}
{"text":"We had a lovely experience here. We were 4 of us and took the harbour tea package.
One of us was a vegetarian and we had forgotten to mention this earlier, but the ladies there quickly made us some vegetarian sandwiches without charging us anything extra.
The scones were very tasty too. A nice cosy atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"The owner, Teri, is one of the sweetest people you'll ever meet!  It is a little family-owned tea boutique so you won't find stuck up waiters in stuffy suits serving you.  The place seats approx. 20+ people total.  The room is also light-filled, QUAINT AND COZY.  have a great tea selection and the assorted sandwiches are fresh.  Teri makes her own scones daily as well as lemon and butter tart squares.  Bring your mom, your boyfriend, your friends, your little girl(s)/boy(s) and their friends... But come hungry!!  what a treat! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Took my 6 year old bestie for the harbour tea. The entire experience was lovely. The staff were delightful, the tea was delicious and the food presentation was great. Everything tasted fresh, and we finished everything ! I would LOVE to give 5 stars, but I deducted a star because of the Awful on line reservation system. I felt like it was designed to prevent customers from accessing this lovely little gem. I will be back soon - it was a fantastic afternoon outing ! - even if I have to do battle with the reservation system."}
{"text":"I've visited The Tea Room twice and was delighted on both occasions. The place is small, so a reservation is a must. This tea room offers a wide selection of teas, and prepares a lovely spread of sandwiches and sweets for their high tea. The high tea is plentiful and it is unlikely that you will leave hungry. It is a wonderful place to catch up with a friend and enjoy some down time."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! I bought a voucher from living social and it was so well worth it! The food was amazing and the tea was phenomenal! The decorate was super cute too! Service is great and overall I absolutely loved the experience. The shop itself is a little small, but that just adds to the charm. I can definitely see myself coming back here very soon."}
