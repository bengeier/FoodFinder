{"text":"IF I COULD GIVE IT 20 stars I would. Great price for a great portion. So quick and fresh! It is the best hibachi I have tasted around this area!!"}
{"text":"I love this little place. It doesn't have a big menu, nor is it innovative, but everything is fresh and tastes great. I'd prefer table service but don't mind ordering at the counter. It's very reasonably priced and you get a lot of food. I hope the Moon Township community will support this great little non-franchise restaurant."}
{"text":"Great little sushi takeout spot in the plaza across from RMU. Reasonably priced and good quality. Efficient service, too!"}
{"text":"Very clean dining room and excellent food!! One of the top hibachi meals I've had in the city. Prices are very reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Really love this place, it's kind of hidden in the shopping center, but their sushi is great! Great selection of sashimi, sushi and rolls; they have a good bit of appetizers as well as bento boxes and soba! Their prices are solid for the amount of food you get! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"First off, I honestly don't think this place knows whether it wants to be a semi nice sit down restaurant or basically fast food.    First time we went they gave us a menu and told us to order at the counter. Ok that's fine; except then when they serve you, you have about 1 minute between courses.  So there we sit with sushi, 2 soups & a main course (decided to share one) in front of us all at once.  Sorry, but that doesn't work for us (or anyone we know for that matter).  Sushi & soup are served on/in regular dishware.  The main course is served on a stryo foam plate.  Seriously???  None of the condiments or napkins are on any of the tables.   Onto the food.  Hot Lover sushi good, Egg drop soup had almost a peppery taste to it...a little weird but edible.  The hibachi Imperial comes with small shrimp, chicken and I think there was beef.  The rice is very sticky more like for the sushi. Honestly, was expecting fried rice.  Nothing fantastic at all about the main course; not much flavor.  Decided to try a take out another day & got General Tso since we both really like it.  Unfortunately barely any chicken inside the breading.  The breading reminded me of what is on a corn dog.  Maybe ok for a corn dog, but definitely not General Tso.  Didn't even see a red pepper in there.  Not sure what happened on both walls, but with the nice paint job, there is two strips of I guess white plaster.  Water leak?"}
{"text":"I was pleased to see a new sushi place in the area as I'd been underwhelmed by others nearby. It's a fast casual type place so dont expect full table service. We tried 6 different roles. While they weren't the most amazing sushi in the world, they were fresh and well rolled. For the price ($4 avocado, cali, veggie rolls and $5 salmon or tuna avocado rolls) this place cant be beat. Great place to bring kids to try sushi without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck! I have gotten the Chicken hibachi double meat hold the onions in the veggies comes with a lot of white rice too for $9 and some change can't beat the portion size and convenience. It's always ready for pickup in ten minutes, so it's ideal for the college student without double meat it's $7 plus tax. Also I tried the 4 piece California roll, hibachi chicken combo and that also came with a side salad and white rice which was only $8.50!! All hibachi orders come with one yum yum sauce cup except for the sushi combo I had to pay .50 extra for it. But this place is good, fast, cheap, & consistent."}
{"text":"Great place for quick hibachi meal! Wife and I have tried everything on the menu and it's all good. The shrimp sauce is the best I have had. Very good and fresh sushi as well."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a co-worker. He was in the mood for fish and when I checked on the yelp app, this place was closest to the hotel with the highest rank stars.   So I tried the following items from the menu:    - Miso soup entree: When this was served to me in a Styrofoam cup, I was astonished and my heart sank, didn't have high hopes for the rest of my meal, especially as found the seaweed taste to be too overwhelming. Also not a fan of that tofu - it was toooo soft! I reckon the Miso soup from Trader Joe's packets is infinitely better. Absolutely wouldn't get again.   S27. Green Dragon Roll (eel, cucumber, avocado and spicy mayo eel sauce) - my #1 ranked roll. So so so good! Something about that umami of the eel, then the softness of the avocado and the crunch of the cucumber just really pleased my taste buds very much. Each bite was lovely.  S34. Spider Roll (soft shell crab, cucumber, avocado, masago and spicy mayo eel sauce) - my #2 ranked roll. Yay! real crab - none of that make stuff! Well cooked, and delicious. Also in case you don't know, masago is is the roe (aka baby fish eggs). Lovely texture and flavours.   S1. Vegetable Sushi roll (w/ avocado, cucumber and carrots) - my #3 ranked roll. Loved the crunch the veggies provided combined with that verdant softness of the avocado.   S31. Godzilla Roll (Eel, crab, salmon, spicy mayo eel sauce) - my #4 ranked roll. I think this one just suffered in comparison to the others and hence ranked it last. Taste-wise, it was all good, just the other 3 options I tried were more to my palate.  So, I ordered x1 roll too many and had some leftovers for lunch the next day as well! Total for this was $40 plus change (includes tip). They don't have dessert options, but I walked away fulling full, but not heavy and overall fairly impressed with their sushi. The Staff were super friendly and enjoyed chatting with them. Wouldn't mind coming back again, when next in the area.    PS -  Eva M hit the nail with her Yelp review, when she wrote, \"While they weren't the most amazing sushi in the world, they were fresh and well rolled.\" I absolutely concur!   Yelp 66/2018"}
{"text":"We loved it! Tried the place out for the first time tonight and the food was so good! The sushi was very fresh and both our Chinese dishes were made just right. They definitely earned our business for life! The staff was super nice and you could tell they truly appreciate your business. You can't pass up small seemingly family owned restaurants like this. Definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"Excellent Value. Very good Hibachi Chicken and Deluxe Bento with Beef. Vegetable Spring Rolls also very good. It is BYOB.  Order at counter and they bring it to you. Excellent Jasmine tea. Will go back to try more."}
{"text":"Great new sushi place! It's super clean, very neat and pretty inside. The service was friendly and fast (we got takeout). We tried 4 rolls and crab Rangoons. All were delicious! My hubby and I are foodies, and we approve!"}
{"text":"So happy we can get delicious sushi locally! We start with the edamame and then order our favorites ; hot mess, sweet heat, volcano and spicy tuna.  Bring it home and wash it down with a drop of sake, perfect. You need paper takeout boxes not polystyrene!! Compostable straws. Please, I want all Moon restaurants to feed us and look after our planet. Please mention as you pay!"}
