{"text":"This was the best taco pizza I've ever had!! I was totally shocked. My daughter even agrees best pizza she has ever had. Not to mention the husband and wife team owners were super sweet!"}
{"text":"The pizza was so wonderful, my mouth is watering still thinking about it. Perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, thick pepperoni hidden underneath the cheese and spicy banana peppers doting the surface. Cheesy perfection.  I will be back very soon!!!"}
{"text":"Average food, but dropped a star, because my Italian sub stated that it had \"mayonnaise\"... but clearly had Miracle Whip. I don't hate Miracle Whip, but it's NOT mayonnaise, and I don't WHY you would put it on an Italian sub. Also, the marinara that came with the cheesy breadsticks was cold, and it really should have been heated."}
{"text":"The gluten-free pizza and subs are delicious.  They have awesome salads too!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Crystalina's Pizzeria is no longer in business at this location. Rumor is that they are opening a new store in Avon Lake, but no word yet. They will be missed, as we thought it was the best pizza in town."}
{"text":"Had a Groupon-type coupon that didn't expire; however, when I tried to use it was told that shop was under new management and were not accepting these coupons any longer.  I thought this was a family business?  Not the best way to endear yourself to a new customer. Now I won't order or recommend it to anyone. Lots of pizza joints in the area to choose from. Stay away from this one."}
{"text":"Great White Garlic Pizza!! Just remember if you don't want your pepperoni hidden you need to ask that when you order!"}
{"text":"With hundreds of businesses in avon.. You have to bring your \"A\" game.  This isn't it.  Pick up was rude.  Like he was angry he had to get out of his chair.  15 min before they closed, but still."}
