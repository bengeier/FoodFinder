{"text":"The service was great and I could have a glass of wine with my gluten free chicken taco! This area needs a place like this."}
{"text":"We went recently and were not very impressed. We live in the neighborhood and were intrigued when this place opened up next to Treeline Catering (also owned by them). We had considered Treeline to cater our wedding, so figured we should try out the Snackbar and see if it's any good. Sadly, it's not. It's overpriced (reason we did not go with Treeline for wedding) and the food was bearable at best. I had the sliders, which were okay. Finished them all but wouldn't rave about them, as they weren't very flavorful and were pretty greasy. I've had much better. My fianc√© got their Long Branch burger and wow. He's not one to ever leave food on his plate but he was unable to finish it. The burger itself was undercooked as in it was mostly pink, falling apart, and very greasy.
Fries were pretty good, however it's kind of hard to mess up fries.
I've never noticed it being busy here (and I drive by it every day a couple times) though that could partially be to the odd location. 
Maybe it was just a bad night, but unfortunately we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Strong lunch game! Pulled pork sandwiches, watermelon salad, pop in a glass bottle.  Reading the other reviews here everyone seems fussy about the price of this joint... And I guess compared to the places in the neighbourhood it is, by a buck or two. But the other places suck, this place is awesome - a very downtown spot to eat in our little neighbourhood. Welcome - we hope you stick around!"}
{"text":"This is no ordinary snack bar! Stop in and you will see what I am talking about. The food is all quality, very tasty, and Devine, for a very reasonable price! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"What a great new addition to our community. This fantastically fresh menu adds flavour, taste and a handheld meal for those looking to sit and enjoy, or grab'n'go.

We loved the Pulled Pork sandwich and the watermelon salad. 
Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We were visiting a friend in Toronto who lives in the area so we stopped by for a quick bite. Really cool decor, the tables make the room feel warm and comfortable. The food itself was great, I went back for a second order of pulled pork sliders because c'mon, Jack and Coke pulled pork?? So good. My friends had a few of the tacos and this place knows an authentic taco, they were killer. No question we will be stopping by again when we get back out that way. You need to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"The best fries I've ever eaten. The pulled pork sliders are really good. My husband and I will definitely be regulars"}
{"text":"This is a great little place in etobicoke that is much needed. Great food and amazing service is what will keep me coming back. Try the steak sandwich - it is absolutely amazing! Had the fries as well and they were very good as well which was amazing. 

I highly recommend this restaurant to others looking for a good quick meal in etobicoke. There isn't a lot of seating - possibly more of a take out place."}
{"text":"Holy crap that was good.  If the rating was on food alone, you'd easily give them 6 stars out of 5.   

Portions are a little small and it can get pricey.  $3.75 for a taco is fine, but maybe a discount if I buy two or three?   Pulled pork sliders were also great, a full size sandwich for $8 or $9 would be great value.  (We pay over $10 for a California sandwich right?)

For a takeout place around the corner from my house, I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"We tried it. Nothing special. Burger was okay. Pricey for quality. Salad was plain. Tacos fell apart! Not a fan."}
