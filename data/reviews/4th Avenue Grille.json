{"text":"This place has been sold once sold twice sold sold sold. And the food has going more downhill than Kyle Rasmussen at Incline Village circa 1982..... give it a pass."}
{"text":"Great cheesesteak! Better than Jim's  in Philly.  What makes it great? It's not overwhelmed with too many green pepper or onions. I love some GP & 0s, but what 4th did very nicely is added red peppers to balance the flava!  The Bonus for this \"bar food\" joint is homemade food and cheap drinks. $2 beers, $5 Long Islands...sure can melt away a stressful day with the madness and loonies at work. Next food to check out on the next visit will be the wings (hoping they're not small) and an Italian sandwich. Sure is hard to find one that doesn't have too much bread. I will let you know. My friend gave the thumbs up on the patty melt. My other friend said the pizza was good, but not spectacular.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time in three years...my reason for the gap was part service and part food.  Sorry For the gap!

Went for happy hour.  Bartender was very friendly and knew my friends (quasi regulars) drinks of choice.  They have four beers on tap and many craft brews in bottles.  

Ordered food.  Previous complaints were the lack of sauce on the wings.  Decided against the wings this time and opted for a sandwich.  Steak and egg sandwich was fantastic with fresh cut that were also excellent.  Everything was cooked perfect.
  
Food and drink was priced reasonably.  Based on my service and food quality I will return soon.

Thanks for a great visit!"}
{"text":"I normally don't write these but I had a very bed experience here this past weekend. Bartenders and regular guests were very rude to my boyfriend and I when we arrived for a specialty event. Clearly a \"locals\" bar. Wouldn't go there if you're not a regular because you're probably not welcome."}
{"text":"Always have had good service here pretty good food and good prices.  I went for the first time about two years ago and have gone back twice since so the food cannot of been that bad,  Ha ha kept me coming back"}
{"text":"Best chili I've ever had. Very good food. Good attitude.

Just recently relocated to Coraopolis and this is a new hangout. 

Probably the only negative is the smokers by the door. I hate that anywhere."}
{"text":"Visiting the Pittsburgh area for work. Wasn't in the mood for chain restaurant cuisine. Saw the 4th ave grille web page and decided to give it a try. Wasn't disappointed! Bartender Amy was friendly and provided great service. I ordered a burger and homemade fries. Cooked perfect with great flavor. Great bar burger! The place was decorated for the holiday season with Xmas music playing in background. Give this place a try......."}
{"text":"I keep giving this place a chance and I keep crossing my fingers that it will be good. Its close to my office so its easy and convenient but its just always something. I have always thought the price of food was rather steep for what you're getting. Sandwiches are usually around 8 dollars, with chips, add TWO dollars for a 50 cent potato sliced up and deep fried. But, convenient, so I kept returning. Until one day the health inspector was there and I ordered a white pizza because i had heard their white pizza was good. The cheese on the pizza was rotten. I could smell it the minute they set it down. I quietly told the bartender who took it and took it off my bill. I asked for a club sandwich (NO CHEESE) to go. I was charged for it. How do you serve a customer rotting food then charge them for what you're replacing it with?? Next time around was today. I ordered a cheeseburger. Simple, right? The entire thing was raw except the burnt outside. I think I have officially given up. How many chances can you give a place before you throw up your hands and move on? It's interesting to see all the positive comments here. Is someone filtering/deleting the negative? Because I have heard A LOT of terrible things about this place lately...hmmmm"}
{"text":"Wings were fatty, fries were undercooked, and the hot sauce on the wings had an overpowering vinegar taste.  The staff was nice and Wed night is .40 wings, but that's all it really had going for it."}
{"text":"Stuck halfway down this one-way street is the 4th Ave Grille. Clean, bright and cheerful, a beacon of light on an otherwise drab and dark road. A full menu (not much for Vegetarians sadly, except for pasta) serves up decent food at great prices with solid service and bargain-priced booze.

What pushed this over the edge into favorite-land for me was the single girl who came in for a beer and a plate of nachos. She claimed she hadn't eaten all day and after a long workday was starved. The bartender hustled to get her a menu and a cold one and she relaxed quietly and happily into a corner.

Gives me  warm fuzzies inside to know  this is the kind of place a girl could come on her own and not worry bout a thing, baby."}
{"text":"Great little bar in Coraopolis- you can expect tasty food, a laid back atmosphere, and friendly staff (plus it's non-smoking)!"}
