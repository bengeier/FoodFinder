{"text":"I've been coming to Coffee Cats for over 10 years now (since my 20's). We are so lucky to have a great coffee shop like this in our neighbourhood! It's great to be a 'local' and I feel like I live in a small town when I'm here. Excellent coffee, spanakopita, sandwiches, and omelettes! Losza is the owner & is great!"}
{"text":"My husband and I having been going to Coffee Cats since we moved into the neighborhood in 2011.  Losza, the owner, makes the food fresh every day - the berry scones are sugar-free and delicious, and she makes up the base sandwiches with extras (tomatoes, mustard, mayo, etc.) after you order to keep it more fresh.  She even put in a nice little patio last year to enjoy the sunny days."}
{"text":"Love this coffee shop for many reason's some of which include great cozy atmosphere and very friendly owner who has time to say hello everytime you go ! Its a small town feel in our busy big city and great place to go unwind and have a great cup of whatever you like and a fresh baked treat! I Coffee cats is a wonderful little coffee shop !"}
{"text":"Coffee Cats is another local cafe that has a cute neighbourhood atmosphere. 
While the service wasnt overly friendly, the lady behind the counter was very efficient and let us know the gigantic cookie, along with most of the other baked goods were made in house. The \"chocolate chip\" cookie I bought was harder (which I happen to love) and crumbly...matter of fact, it didnt look like a cookie at all..and tasted healthier than a cookie would. It was curious, but I still really enjoyed it, and the huge medium americano I ordered. The medium was the size of a large in most places, so my tip is stay by the bathroom if you order the large of any drink."}
{"text":"I went to Coffee Cats Cafe early in the morning on February 14th 2015 and paid for my cappuccino by visa.  Upon returning home I happened to check the receipt and realized that I'd inadvertently typed in my pin # as a tip, resulting in close to $50 above the price of my beverage.  I contacted them, was told they had already realized my mistake,  and asked me to stop in at any time to have the amount returned to me in cash.  I have since picked up the $ and commended the owner on her kindness and generosity when  she could have very well chalked it up to being my own mistake and not offered to return any of it.  While I was there she showed me  another time where someone had made a similar mistake leaving a tip that was in the 3 digit range.  This was from 2014.   While she is hoping the person contacts her upon noticing their mistake, she said if this doesn't happen she  will proceed in donating it to charity.  In this day and age I'm very impressed with this level of customer service and honesty."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and food. Have never had trouble with the owner yelling at me, but then I don't eat food I brought in myself."}
{"text":"Nice little cafe with ample seating. Would prefer some comfy big chairs/couches though! The breakfast sandwiches and omelettes are pricier than I think they are worth. A few more breakfast items would be great. Fantastic Chai Tea Latte though, even for $5.20 and coming out of a jug."}
{"text":"It's curious how one can get a \"feeling\" about a place just by walking in the door. This was a real good feeling and the longer I lingered the better it got.
Maybe it was the warm colours, the comfortable tables and chairs, the excellent coffee or the warmth of the owner. For sure it was the free coffee purchased by some earlier anonymous customer and the giant blueberry scone sweetened only with fruit. 
Coffee Cats also has free wi-fi now so it will be a regular stop for this cat lovin' java hound."}
{"text":"Coffee Cats Café has a silly name, but you'll feel good drinking a warm drink here.

There is nothing particularly original about Coffee Cats Café but it is one of my favourite new discoveries along 17th Ave.  Its one of those locally owned coffee shops that you just feel better after spending your money there. The owner is a nice woman who runs the shop essentially all on her own.  There is also lots of homemade sandwiches, snacks and treats to enjoy and the atmosphere is great. 

You know you are hanging out in a cool place when pretty much everyone that comes in is a regular.   On my first visit here, a little kid actually went behind the counter to give the barrista a hug!  It was a great moment to see.  

They don't have WIFI, but what they do have is a great selection of books that you can read while you are sipping your perfect tasting London Fog (medium: $4.45). 

If you are looking for a place to put your laptop down and enjoy a great conversation or a quiet read, Coffee Cats Café might be the place for you!"}
{"text":"awesome. Just plain awesome.  Lots of space to sit. Lots of choice for us lactose intolerant folks."}
{"text":"The croissants are a delicious combination of brie and fresh veggies. The coffee and service are top notch. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was looking for something centrally located to have a long, overdue visit with a friend who I was excited to see! I found this quaint little place and what was so great and convenient about the location was the fact that I now know where Hot Yoga on 17th is, literally right next door. I love hot yoga, and regularly go to the studio in Crowfoot.
As for the food, it was delicious, I had the daily soup with a toasty BLT. I loved the atmosphere, the ambiance, and for sure the free wifi. The lady was pleasant, and very friendly. Coffee here was perfect too... Definately worth a visit again in the future!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee!!  This cafe is gentle and inviting.  There is a shelf of books to pick through while you enjoy your coffee and quirky cat and coffee art on display.  Service is exceptional and the coffee is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"We've been going to the Coffee Cats Cafe for at least five years now.  It's in our neighbourhood so a wonderful walk or bike ride with a nice reward at the end.  The owner is warm and welcoming and takes great pride in her offerings.  It's a fantastic, locally owned cafe that beats any chain coffee shops hands down.  Try the choco chai on a cool day as it's sure to warm you up with those aromatic spices.  Great atmosphere and baking!"}
{"text":"Great staff, nice selection of handmade goods such as pastries, soups, sandwiches, etc. Delicious coffee too!"}
{"text":"Was working across the street.  Had a personal emergency,  bathroom,  and it was an emergency.  I offered whomever was working about $175 ( that's all the change I had) &she said no unless I buy at the very least a water. $2.25. Bit much for the use of your facilities. The was empty when I started my job and empty after. Perhaps it's a personality thing with whomever was working, but there's also a thing called HUMANITY & she exhibited none of it.
I WOULDN'T GO THERE ON A BET."}
{"text":"A chill and welcoming family coffee shop that's good for all ages of people, make Coffee Cats my now go-to coffee shop in the west 17th area. 
You wouldn't describe it as cool or trendy, but if you're into those cool and trendy coffee shops, you'll definitely prefer its small business feel (because it is a small business) of Coffee Cats over the Good Earth next door. 

Throughout the course of the morning while I have been sitting here working, I have seen several groups of seniors come here to socialize, mothers with young children meeting up for a cuppa while the kids try their hardest not to be bored and rambunctious and almost succeeding. Good job, kids!

It's not an old, comfortable building, but they do a nice job of turning this plaza strip mall property into a place that feels authentic. Artificial plants, exposed brick wallpaper, and painted book shelves do their best to make it feel kind of like Grandma's kitchen.

You can get breakfast options like omelettes and I got myself a breakfast egg bagel sandwich that was pretty tasty. The bagels are a pretty nice standout from you could expect."}
{"text":"I normally go to Starbucks for coffee, but me and a colleague had driven by this place a few times and we decided to take the risk and try it. When we arrived we found the decor fairly traditional, but the place was nice and clean. There were pastries there and I did not realize the selection was going to be so good. We each ordered a latte. Wow..they were delicious. The foam was done just right. We shared a pastry and it was very nice. The pastry was light and fluffy. The person that served us was very polite but not overly friendly...i don't really like it when a person is over friendly...so this person suited me perfectly...the atmosphere was comfortable and we were able to chat about our work without a noisy background. While I still love my Starbucks...Coffee Cats now has a space in my heart as well..."}
{"text":"I will not be going back.  I go to Coffee Cats to support small local businesses, even though it's a bit pricey, but I recently went with a colleague and although we ordered a drink, my colleague was told he had to make a minimum purchase or leave.  Even though we explained that we were together and I had already ordered, he was told that he has to make a purchase because he was using up space (!!) and parked in the car park.  

For a small local business, I would have expected a lot more.  Clearly the lady serving didn't care about customer service or customer experience.  In future I'll go right across the street to Second Cup where the service is excellent and they even give me FREE biscuits and water for my dogs."}
{"text":"A privately owned cafe owned by a nice lady who bakes her own cakes and makes yummy sandwiches. They have a small library of books at the back to read, which gives this place a homey feeling and look.

I like!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like Coffee Cats - I really did.  And for a while, it was good.  Delicious food, good coffee, cute atmosphere, super-local and friendly feeling.  But then... I had a couple of breakfast meetings here.  The woman who was there in the morning (I think the owner, but not sure) was, frankly, rude.  One time she yelled at me for snacking on a homemade cookie that was in my purse; another time, she got quite upset that we were (quietly, when the cafe was nearly empty) watching a short YouTube video (too loud, apparently).

In short, the glares and unwelcoming attitude got to be too much.  Seriously though, for a coffee shop, good food."}
{"text":"Excellent homemade good!

Service was fast and friendly, the place is certainly clean. I had been there last summer, and enjoyed the outdoor patio so thought I would try a visit  winter. 
Really glad I went, noticed that they also serve wine in the evenings, and everything is made from scratch
Well done, these types of small places with hard-working local owners are becoming fewer and fewer but I sure appreciate coffee cats!"}
{"text":"Oh this is the most adorable little café and it's a five minute walk from my house! The décor is so cute and any one that loves cats will like it here. I've come here on a couple Friday mornings to eat breakfast and enjoy reading and book and Coffee Cats is just perfect for that. There are so many people doing different things, I feel like it's a place you go if you are interesting. The breakfasts are delicious and hand crafted but I must rave about the coffee. I've had many caramel machiatto's, but this place is the best hands down. Seriously, you want to go here. I just love it!"}
{"text":"I always hear stories about independent coffee shops shutting down when a big chain moves in nearby. I'm happy to see there is no such thing happening to Coffee Cats Cafe being that there's a Second Cup with a drive through window right next door. 

I was in the area looking for a late lunch and decided to give this spot a go after reading Mike M's note that they have homemade sandwiches. It so happened that there was a turkey wrap left in the cooler with my name on it :). The wrap wasn't overly fancy but it certainly beat anything I'd ever find at a big chain for freshness and size, and for about the same price.

I ordered a large coffee with my wrap as well. The woman behind the counter grabbed two mugs, a tall skinny one and a big fat short one. She held up the tall skinny one and said \"this one is a medium, are you sure you want a large?\" Nope, I most certainly did not. The medium was big enough!

I'm also happy to report that the CCC (I love acronyms) does in fact have wifi. Just ask for the code at the counter."}
{"text":"To be honest, I don't think that I will be returning to the Coffee Cats Cafe for a few reasons. 

First, I am a huge supporter of local businesses and when it comes to coffee shops and restaurants especially, I actively seek them out. It made me excited to find a local owned coffee shop walking distance from my house. That being said, from the moment that my roommate and I walked inside, we did not feel welcome. We were there to study so we had our books with us, and we managed to find a seat where we could plug in our computers. I ordered a small regular coffee and a cookie for a whopping price of $5.00. I wouldn't mind paying that price anywhere else however the $3 coffee was not very good, and i could have skipped the cookie.

Second, the somewhat unfriendly owner walked up to my roommate who was still deciding on whether or not she wanted coffee. Now, this is a cafe where you walk up to the counter to order and the owner came over as if she was going to serve her. When my roommate explained that she was still deciding, the owner looked at her and said \"there is a minimum price you must pay to be in here, so come to the counter to choose something.\" This made both of us very uncomfortable. Now, if my roommate had come in alone and did not order something, then I would understand the gesture. However, as a server myself, if I had a couple come in to my restaurant and one person had ordered something (nonetheless TWO things), and the other had just ordered water, I would not ask them to leave or to pay a minimum price. Also, this is not to say my roommate was not going to order something at all, she just needed time to decide. I instantly asked for a to go mug and wrapped my cookie in a napkin so we could find somewhere a little more welcoming in our area. 

Overall, I feel like there is a certain crowd that the Coffee Cats Cafe is trying to draw in, and as two students, we were definitely shown the door quicker than two stray cats (if you'll excuse the pun)."}
{"text":"Love this independent coffee shop. Those of us in this neighbourhood find Coffee Cats to be a great meeting spot. The coffee is awesome too!"}
{"text":"Great coffees and teas.  Food is quite good and tastes homemade.  The lady at the counter who is also the owner prides herself in the food she makes.  I would support this establishment again.

Food is a bit on the pricey side though for what you are getting."}
{"text":"The coffee is not bad, but I have had better coffees in the city .. The service is veeeeeryyyy sloooooowww... So, don't go there if you are in a rush or hungry... The only reason to have 3 stars is because the bagels are good.. Other than that I would have rated them with 2 stars only..."}
{"text":"One of the worst coffee experiences to date. My latte was expensive and bad tasting. Perhaps this used to be a good place for coffee but it seems the owner / management isn't into this business anymore. 

If you're passionate about coffee, and appreciate  specialty coffee, go somewhere else."}
