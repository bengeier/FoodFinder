{"text":"The name of this place is very misleading!!  You would think it's more like Alladin's bakery, where they have baked goods and dine-in area!!  The place is more like a grocery store with a deli section to order food to-go!! Their hummus was good, and the spinach pies were good too but didn't have enough filling!! I normally come here for groceries and snacks!!  It's always clean and employees are always helpful!!  It's definitely worth it to check out this place!! In the future, I'd like to try their shawarma and other prepared foods!!"}
{"text":"If you are in the North Olmsted area and looking for some middle eastern food look no further, Ya Hala Bakery is the place! Let me start by saying their service is great and their food is so delicious. The portion sizes are huge and the food is very rich in favor, you wouldn't go wrong with anything you order. To even add to the experience the store was super clean and has a very pleasant atmosphere. Best Arabic food in Cleveland hands down!  Everything is always fresh from the succulent chicken to the softest bread! Plus they have a whole line of middle eastern groceries. While you're there you can even pick up your self some hookah tobacco!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Ya hala! I go by badgirl_hustle on IG and I've done a review for this place for my followers. I love how clean the place is and how friendly the staff is! And omg!!!! The bread with the cheese is to die for! If you're in the area for lunch I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"All around great place!-from the atmosphere & interior decor-to the customer service & staff. It was my first time visiting & It's very bright & cozy from the moment you walk in! Amongst other things-They carry all middle eastern groceries with a large variety of brands to choose from- including dairy items, produce, sweets & Canned/pre-packaged products. Not to mention the ready to order fresh made food to go, for on the spot goodness ( falafel, sandwiches, meat/spinach pies, kabobs, ect.) or catered trays for takeout/parties. Large selection of fresh, homemade sweets & desserts also! & They even have an in-house butcher that's there & ready to cut up what ever you'd like on the spot. - oh & they also carry all necessary hookah supplies & accessories (also plenty tobacco flavors & brands to choose from)   That's always a plus! Its a newer a family owned/run business & everyone working was very pleasant in answering all my questions & making sure I was able to find what I was looking for. I noticed employees helping customers carry bags/load groceries on several occasions & not just pointing ppl. In the right direction of where to find something...but actually walking w.them & reviewing brands, prices ect. If they'd asked for something in particular. To me, that's sincere quality customer service. It's those sort of gestures that make a difference! I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"My family ordered from here, I went in to pick the order, I have to say I've never seen a cleaner middle easter grocerie story. It's organized, not overwhelming, and very clean. The aiels  are very easy to view and find what you need. Clean produce and meat. The food they cool for catering looks delicious we can't wait to eat it! The staff is super friendly. They smile and are sweet when u come in. They are always asking if there is something you can do and apologize for any delays or mistakes. I have to say. I've been to my fair share of resturants in the north olmsted and parma area, this has got to be the best. I hope they stay open for a long long time, my family is officially relocating arabic store to this one. Thank you for everything. And thank you most of all for the amazing service. I don't know where there are bad reviews I had to go in my self to see this, and my inlaws were not kidding about how nice and clean the staff are."}
{"text":"This place is great. I have had there to go food twice. its been amazing both times. The super market looks great. I am not sure what a lot of the stuff is but the staff was very friendly and answered any questions I had. I will def be returning here often."}
{"text":"A huge boon to North Olmsted! Middle eastern market with lots of the frozen items you are looking for, some fresh veg, genuinely fresh pita - soft and pliable, and really well made takeout items, and a variety of beverages and pickles.    The deli chef is an excellent cook. What we tried from the deli over the course of four visits:  Lebnah - a soft cheese with spicing. Spicy (if you're not used to spice). Excellent. Hummus - made with quality Lebanese tahini. A little different than I make it, but quite good.  Baba Ganoush - creamy garlic and eggplant Tabbouli/taruli - made right.  A parsley salad with a smattering of bulgur, seasoned just right. Breaded cauliflower - very nice. Deep fried, flavored breading Spinach pie - thumbs up from the other eaters. I didn't have one. Meat pies - two varieties tried. Both well made, one with more cumin than the other. Fresh very large flat bread - sort of afghani style, my knowledge is limited here. Fresh and pliable.  Kusa - a garlicky squash dip. Yum. Fried zucchini in tahini. Yes. Manakish zatar, manakish cheese and zatar. Small flatbreads with cheese and/or zatar, an herb blend. Delightful.  Various desserts, including nougat with apricot, and several fried and sugared desserts, names unknown to me. All good quality."}
{"text":"Hmmm... Not sure how to rate this place.  It is definitely more of a grocery than a sit down kind of place.   I went because all the great Yelp reviews and to be honest was pretty disappointed.  I came with my daughter hoping to grab a quick bite.  I kinda expected a place a little like Aladdins but this is definitely more casual than that.  Like, go to a deli counter and order.  Prices weren't bad but there were a couple red flags for me.  First off, there isn't really a table to eat at.  At least not the kind that you would expect in a restaurant.  When I asked they took me to what felt like a back room area with a number of torn up chairs and a table.  Didn't give a fork or knife.  I watched one of the staff stir the rice with his bare hand after touching some other kitchen stuff.    Kabob was tasty, I'll admit.  Kafta had a chunk (about 1 mm) of some hard substance that was either a small pebble or chunk of bone in it.  Dolmades were fair.  We got a cheese bread that wasn't a bad deal.    It was OK.  Not sure if I understand all the glowing reviews.  I'd take an Aladdins Flavor Savor any day over this and it's not that much more.  Also I can't shake that image of that dude putting his bare hands into the rice and stirring it.  And I think that he was smoking outside too later on."}
{"text":"What a fun middle eastern grocery and deli!  I not only had one of the best chicken shawarma's EVER, but the gentleman that waited on me was friendly and very informative about the food. I got hummus, pitta bread and the shawarma. All very fresh. In fact there was a sale - 2 sandwiches for $10!  (Yes....I got two and feasted on it the next day!) I will def be back."}
{"text":"I stopped in for some groceries and a few take out items. I highly recommend their foule (fava beans) and stuffed grape leaves. I believe it is run by a family, and each person I've encountered is friendly and helpful. The take out items are fresh and delicious and the grocery is well-stocked with a wide variety of items. I found this place while in town to visit family. If I was around more often I'd certainly be a regular."}
{"text":"I stop by here every now and then on my way back to Buffalo to grab my mom her Middle-Eastern grocery wish list. I used to go somewhere else until I found this place driving by. I will not go anywhere else, even though this is a 30 minute drive for me. They are unbelievably clean and organized, everything looks fresh and they are genuine and honest people. They have a decent selection of everything and the pricing is fair compared to other places. Last time I came in, I had a big haul and they insisted to carry it out to my car. I felt like family.  I have yet to try out their actual cooked meals, although I've heard nothing but great things about it.   I will be heading there today for moms haul! :)"}
{"text":"Great find on Yelp, as I was shopping in the area.  My daughter and I love Middle Eastern food.  We stopped in on a Saturday evening.  She ordered a Chicken Shwarma sandwich from the grill.  While we waited, I perused the aisles.  The meat case contained marinated chicken, lamb and other goodies at great prices.  I got marinated thighs, and tenders, along with pita bread, homemade hummus and taboule, also at a great price.  We arrived home and the Shwarma sandwich was so large that we split it.  The meat was tender, flavorful and juicy.  Also the staff was extremely nice, I can't wait to return when in the area again."}
{"text":"We stopped in out of curiosity and were blown away by the amazing aromas and friendly staff! We left with some tasty international treats and will defiantly be back next time we are in the area ."}
{"text":"Scary.  Can't believe the last review. Not sure what they were thinking. Alladins on Carnegie is the real deal. This is a shell of a deal. Turned in my restaurant.com for another deal based on my walking into the store . Ick"}
{"text":"First, customer service & hospitality is top notch, far better than one would except to an encounter.  With that being said, food vastly exceeds the quality of a deli! Best falafel I've ever had and my wrap was the perfect balance of falafel, veg, fresh herbs, and heat - all for $4.99! Ask for their special tea, so unique and delicious. Don't pass this little gem up!"}
{"text":"Great store with good prices variety and very friendly and helpful family staff. Delicious prepared food. You can feed a small family for $10. Wish I had this store near my house."}
{"text":"Unlike any Mediterranean food I've ever had- and not in a good way.  This meal gave me food poisoning for 2 days.  The meat was sour.  The \"salad\" is just diced tomatoes, cucumbers and WAY too much herb- no lettuce of any kind tho. The \"personal salad\" has a filmy white cream dressing.  The platters are skewers (1 per person) and a bunch of condiments/toppings. Expensive for what you actually eat.  The Hummus was actually good however, they don't serve it with any pita or veggies. Not sure how you eat hummus without something to dip in it?  Side note- I ordered this via GrubHub and although it is not the restaurants fault, the driver never showed to pick up the food. You prepay so she received her money- she even confirmed that the food was received even tho she never showed to pick it up. In the end I had to call both the restaurant and GrubHub 2.5 hours later to receive my food. Perhaps that is why it made me so ill."}
{"text":"Um, I've got to say I have mixed reviews about this place. I was craving a gyro and since This place was nearby I thought I'd stop in after seeing the pictures on yelp. Oh how I was deceived! After walking in I noticed how filthy the floors were and there was a fly or two circling about. The vertical spits that are usually used to cook this tasty meat were not in use. Instead the gentleman who appeared friendly enough, pulled some giant bowl out from behind the deli and threw the meat onto the stove griddle....it looked like steak. And it kind of tasted like steak."}
{"text":"Came in since I saw all the 5 star reviews. I got a beef shawarma, which was the best I've ever had. Prices were good too, so I will definitely be back to try more stuff. I understand why this place gets good reviews."}
{"text":"If you live in Westlake or North Olmsted, you probably drive by here on a pretty regular basis. Bet you didn't know they have great shawarmas. Well, they do. For the same price of Taco Bell or McDonald's you get get actual food made specifically because you ordered it. This is definitely a great place to throw into your takeout repertoire."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was  casual but it felt very homey.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  The food is awesomely tasty.  The staff is correct, the falafel is the best tasting, crunchy, yet moist."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Delicious food. The garlic naan bread was my favorite! Tabouli seasoning was perfection!!! We had an uber eats at work, and the order was wrong, the owner himself came and delivered a new order to our job. Much appreciated!! I got a spicy chicken shawarma and it was delish!! Salim edak! Full of flavor!"}
