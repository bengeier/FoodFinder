{"text":"I really love this place. But I ordered their spicy chicken rice ball to try it out. And when I bit into it; I learned there was spam or a fishy smell. It clearly wasnt chicken. (I have a pet peeve for businesses who don't accurately  describe what's in the food as I try to stay away from certain foods) I wouldn't have purchased the rice ball if I knew there was spam or some sort of fish. It's really gross.
Other than that: the food is awesome. I wish they would bring back there cheesecake or have it in stock."}
{"text":"This place is a complete nightmare. I ordered online and waited 20 min before we went to go pick it up. Someone called me and when I called back it said the line was busy. Finally I got a hold of them and they asked if we could switch the white rice to brown rice and I said ok. When I got there they yelled at me and where so rude saying they called me 5 times and I never answered (lie). They had 4 Uber eats drivers waiting in the lobby complaining about the wait time. They where completely out of all rice and eggs. No to mention after they yelled at me I just left. Thank goodness I choose to pay cash in the store instead of card online."}
{"text":"Love Kingo Bowl! Great food & service! They also have a cool product called CoinOut that allows you to save your change from paying with cash to your phone number. You currently get double your coin change back on every purchase. Just ask them to CoinOut next time you are buying to earn free cash back."}
{"text":"Your correspondent came here recently and had a steak bowl combo, which is a few slices of sous vide steak on white rice with Japanese pickles, a perfectly poached egg which I mixed into the rice like bibimbap, some fried onions, sliced mushrooms, and a sublimely hot black pepper sauce. Reader, this was freaking delicious. With the bowl came a slim bottled drink, black current iced tea. At $13 it was a bit pricey but high quality and I honestly don't know if anyone could frankly tell if this was sous vide or not, plus the black pepper sauce sort of overwhelms everything, but this was great. I hope they are successful."}
{"text":"the steak is amazing???the way they make steak is kind of magic I have never heard?love this place?"}
{"text":"I ordered the beef sirloin with salad, pickled cucumber, mixed veggies, and a soft-boiled egg. My husband ordered the teriyaki chicken , brown rice&salad half and half, berries and fried onions. The sirloin was a bit over-cooked for me. Therefore, it's a bit drier than I expected it to be. The soft-boiled egg was good, and the sauce was spot on. The teriyaki chicken was great, and I like their teriyaki sauce as well!"}
{"text":"The concept looked great while looking into the window while walking by....so I decided to try the gyudon (Japanese beef) and it was sooo so good!  You must try this place...and their rice balls are wonderful as well..it reminds me of Hawaii and chicken musubi!"}
{"text":"Had the Steak Bowl with the garlic sauce. Amazing! The steak was cooked to perfection and the addition of the egg topped it off perfectly! Will definitely frequent this place!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place!!! 
Everything is customizable. The base, protein, toppings and sauce. You can tell that the owner really values the customer's overall experience in the store and opinions of their food. 
The meat is cooked using sous vide and it's delicious! Hard to find a place that provides high quality food with such affordable price."}
{"text":"Very affordable and testy! My favourite is the steak bowl with garlic sauce. Excellent service. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"It's in a little shopping mall and worth it's weight in gold wow was it amazing and the staff very helpful for first time"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the food is simply amazing. 
The way they cook their food makes it taste fresh.

Pros: simple and easy to eat.
          Taste good
          Clean environment
          Easy to order
          Great fast food to go
          A lot of choices to choose from

Con's: a bit expensive for the portion size, but is it worth it? Absolutely."}
{"text":"I heard this place from friends introduction. Decide to try it last week when I was shopping at Mekong. This kind of west and east combination style food is pretty new to me. The speed it fast because it just made fresh and put on the warmer. The steak is half raw style which is my favorite. What amaze me is the egg. I still don't know how they control the temperature to make the egg so soft. However , for me the beef with rice is not my Asian rice eating style. It is kind of too dry. Already suggest them to change the rice to salad for some customers like me. Hope they can change it in the future. Then I can visit more often. 
Another thing about there service is they use open kitchen. So I can see the whole clearness. Everyone wear the glove or even something cover the mustache! Really rear to see from other places."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I had a steak bowl/salad since I had lettuce instead of rice but it was so good. Much better than when you just order a steak salad for some reason. The soft slightly runny egg is perfect and the taste and texture added by extra toppings of your choosing are unmatchable.  I agree that it is right on the verge of being overpriced but it is so good. Maybe finding a healthy option with this much diversity is worth the price to some. I'm not sure yet. But I will be going back to find out;)"}
{"text":"Sous-Vide is an amazing cooking technique which infuses the meat with amazing flavor and reduces toughness from classic over-cooking. Had the large goudon (sp?) bowl with onions and pickles (picked with ginger). My mother and sister ordered half and half bowls (half salad and half rice). I personally would not do this as I felt the rice wilted the lettuce. However, they liked it. It is inside the Plaza, so you won't see it until you enter the north entrance and walk a bit towards the \"food court\". Their tea is also amazing. We all tried different ones. Apple Milk, Hawaiian (hibiscus), and black. (The staff gave my sister her tea for free when they found out it was her birthday.)
Took my boyfriend the following week, the black pepper steak, just as good!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place! Super delicious! Will be coming back. They were super quick. I got the brown rice/salad half and half with steak. Topped with sliced mushrooms, veggies, sunflower seeds, and the black pepper sauce."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! I recommend getting the gyudon bowl. The best parts about the place is how they prepare the food and the fact they offer brown rice for people who eat healthy."}
{"text":"I had gone by this place to kind of check it out because I keep hearing about it and was brought in by wonderful staff and service. It's very unique style and culture is what brings together the amazing dishes.  I was welcomed by the cashier and all of the staff with genuine  consideration. Also, they taught all of what goes into the dishes. It was a very savory meal, I enjoyed with steak and brown rice with pickles, which was surprisingly the pop in the meal. I highly recommend and support this place very much, I would hope you would as well, for a healthy and savory meal. Thank you"}
{"text":"I ordered the a full size unagi, but I got half. The quail eggs were cold. And the side of mixed vegetables was small. Everything tasted great just not satisfied."}
{"text":"Really love the sous-vide type of cooking. I ordered the unagi bowl and onigiri with apple milk tea. The rice was cooked perfectly, and so was every other ingredient. The unagi practically melted in my mouth. The onigiri was good, although it could use more filling and could have been packed more tightly."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. On my last three orders I order and payed using their online ordering system which is easy to use. The problem is that on every visit when I go to pick up my food they have had to make a substitution because they ran out of something. The substituted item is always cheaper than the item I ordered and they say they can't give me a refund. Once, okay; twice, hmm, I'm not so sure; three times, it's a regular scam. Also, watch the automatic tipping on the online service, why is there a need to tip on a takeout order?"}
{"text":"Very unique and delicious bowls! We had the chicken and beef and definitely coming back for more. Their sauces are awesome. Have yet to try their desserts and based on Yelp pics they look delicious too."}
{"text":"We like it here.  Try the milk tea they make and bottle on site. It's small, but the macaroons are huge!!
Drawback...none."}
{"text":"My wife wasn't really a fan (no veggies / vegetarian option really), but I thought it was good stuff (I'm a carnivore)."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Kingo Bowl on multiple occasions and have always been impressed by what they put out. I hadn't had anything like this place the first time I found this place and now I can't get enough. If you get a chance check this place out in person. They also deliver on DoorDash!"}
{"text":"New and updated menu. Food is still excellent. There is now an option for full or half bowls. New items, such as skewers, salads, and rice balls are now available. I had the chance to taste their spicy mayo chicken rice ball. Very tasty! Their drinks are now placed in skinny bottles. I love the idea! Definitely give it a try! Employees are always nice and owner is very accommodating."}
{"text":"So good! Had the steak with black pepper sauce and the gyudon bowls, along with a chicken onigiri. Everything was super flavorful and for a great price. Their bowls are fresh and absolutely delicious, putting a nice spin on your regular teriyaki bowls. 

Only thing I'd hope for is that they include a vegetarian option in the future so I can suggest the place to some vegetarian friends!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! It's a very unique place because they cook sou vide style and the rice bowls taste amazing. I ordered an onigiri with spicy beef inside and I was very pleased. I will definitely come back soon to try the chicken! I recommend getting an egg on top!"}
{"text":"First time at makong plaza and it did not disappoint. Stopped by Kingo Bowl for lunch after grocery shopping. Very convenient. I ordered a chicken bowl. It was served in a large bowl (a ton of food). The quality of the chicken was poor but the price was right (7.99). I ordered the garlic butter sauce which was very buttery. The device was great. Staff is super friendly here"}
{"text":"Kingo Bowl is yummy!  It'd definitely worth a try!  It's located inside the Mekong Plaza."}
{"text":"I loved this place. When you want healthy, balanced, well prepared and served food, come here. I was not there during a rush hour, but they take their time to make your food as good as it tastes. I ordered the bowl with rice, and beef which is topped with an egg. (If you do not like pouched eggs, maybe let them know about it). I Chose the black pepper sauce to go with it which was really good as it had garlic as well (if you like garlic but don't want to get the \"all garlic\" sauce). I will stop next time to try their teas or desserts! The owners were really nice, and that is a plus!"}
{"text":"This is the only place that offers onsen tamago (Japanese soft boiled egg, or \"hot spring egg\") in their food in the Phoenix area (or at least the only one I know of...if you know other places let me know). I chose to dine there mainly because it's a new restaurant and it offers the egg. I love the meat options too, especially the steak. However, the amount of food was not large, so I won't feed myself there when I am hungry. Also, the space is small and seating is limited, so next time I probably will just order something to go."}
{"text":"Imagine if a French Michelin star cooking style met an Asian fast food favorite, the rice bowl.  What would you have?  Where would it look like?  Well, if you venture to the west side of Mesa along the Dobson Road corridor and turn west in to Mekong Plaza, then venture inside the Mekong Marketplace Food Court, you will find Kingo Bowl Molecular Sous-vide restaurant. 

Sous-vide is a French word for under vacuum, however the food here does not suck whatsoever.  Kingo Bowl uses this method of cooking exclusively, which results in incredibly tender and succulent meat that is served atop white or brown rice along with tasty, spicy and savory sauces.  As an added bonus, a perfectly cooked, poached Hot Spring or hard-boiled egg can be added to any of the rice bowls for just a dollar more.  Whoever came up with this menu concept has proven, once again, that the marriage of Eastern and Western styles of cooking can successfully coexist and result in delicious harmony.

The genius of the Sous-vide process is that protein, or vegetables, are sealed inside an impermeable plastic pouch keeping flavors, aromas and moisture from escaping.  This pouch is then bathed in a specific temperature of heated water, which is typically the desired internal temperature of a protein such as 140°.  The cook can last for several hours, proving that low and slow is the best way to produce tender, juicy, flavorful meat.  All three proteins that I sampled on my most recent visit were incredibly tender and flavorful and required very little sauce, which is uncommon for most rice bowl meals.  The good, or bad, thing about using Sous-vide is that there is no way to hide quality protein; because if its delicate cooking style, lean, tender meat must be used.  So far, what I have eaten here shows that they are using quality beef and chicken, however I suspect that there will be the occasional protein that goes unchecked and thus it will reveal itself in a glaring way.

What I can tell you is, the food here is tasty, the menu is straightforward and simple, with just a few choices to be able to eat here often enough when you have a craving for a rice bowl and yet still leave satiated and satisfied.  As long as customer service remains friendly and prompt, Kingo Bowl will do well.  However, I do see the very limited seating capacity being their Achilles heel for patrons who choose to dine in as there is only two tables: a two top and a four top . . . perhaps this is why they are pushing online ordering. 

A few pluses; there seems to be a focus on rotating the dessert choices which means that you will typically have a fresh option for dessert.  The drink choices are a little on the light side, offering milk tea and brewed tea . . . the free water option comes with the added benefit that it is at least filtered.  Overall, I love the concept of Kingo Bowl, however, I would love to see some additional protein choices available and a vegetarian bowl option that would also allow for the inclusion of a side of fresh veggies along with their regular rice bowls.  

I do expect to see the Sous-vide rice bowl concept replicated elsewhere as well as becoming a popular trend this year at other restaurants.  Previously, only Haute Cuisine was treated to such a sophisticated cooking technique, however now that it has trickled down to the common rice bowl, I anticipate diners catch on quickly and make Sous-vide the standard in the years to come.

{"text":"Awesome service. I went on Grubhub to get the $12 for $20 voucher. I used these vouchers and there was no tax on the food. That is like killing two birds with one stone. The cashier is very patient too."}
{"text":"This place is super good. The gyudon bowl and steak bowl are amazing !! The manga habanero sauce is sweet and spicy, and the rice balls are yummy. The staff is super nice too. Kyla is an awesome person too. 10/10 I recommend."}
{"text":"Low & Slow

If you don't know, Sous Vide is a French cooking technique involving water, controlled heat and time..  It is a method that is normally only used in fancy kitchens. Kingo is the first of its kind in Chandler and probably of all of Arizona in general.

I decided to get the Japanese bowl (gyudon) with the strips of beef on a bed of brown rice and four quail eggs. The beef strips were tender and everything was literally cooked to perfection. For the price of nine dollars for a large bowl you are getting incredible value.

My only complaint is that they tend to under season their dishes but this may just be acultural thing."}
{"text":"I spent a ridiculous amount of time researching the sous vide cooking method on my own for fun, before my family was enticed by the pictures they have outside their doors. AND THEY MISERABLY FAILED. I ordered a half steak half galbi with white rice, a spring egg, fried onions, pickles, and mushrooms in a garlic butter sauce. 

-The steak was WELL DONE, without any significant char. Not even leniently medium (advertising a medium rare), and recieving the meal hardly warm.
-The kalbi (almost as thin as cheesesteak meat), i honestly just feel like they ate themselves and gave me the bones. Charred much better, but the thinnest possible cut of meat just made every piece taste like butane.
-The pickles were certainly not japanese, neither in taste or vegetable. Very briney, not sweet--salty and sour. 
-Why white button mushrooms??? And how did you get them to taste canned?
-The egg was (no contest) the ONLY successful things they made, because i mean the fried onions were store bought, and the rice was mushy.

WORST OF ALL: Their butter garlic sauce was literally melted butter and RAW chopped garlic. Even worse than the 100% absence of salt, or the fact the only seasoning was a pinch of furikake on the egg, it wasn't even bland. It all tasted like raw garlic. Everything the butter touched. 
If i were at a sit down restaurant, I wouldn't even have bothered to ask for a replacement. 

They've comepletely missed the entire point of the concept of sous vide cooking and had in fact made something just simply terrible."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. Very tasty bowls and reasonably priced. I see that Mia M. Mentioned they used to be grab n go bowls, but it seems they've changed and are now offering bowls made fresh. I think preparing it fresh really is the key. Will be eating here regularly!"}
{"text":"I've never really been a fan of Chinese food, and I don't know if this qualifies as Chinese food, but this place rocks my socks. I love the menu and the options are very easy to choose from. Very tasty, and I love the flavor in each bowl. The tea variety is alsoA cherry on top. We will definitely be back again. Had a Groupon so that helped, otherwise it is a little bit pricey hence minus one star"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place. I was excited to try it, and had high hopes from some of the reviews and photos. We came in tonight (Sunday evening) around 6:30 pm and I was so sad that I raved about this place, only to walk in and see that there were no shrimp/salmon options (for my pescatarian friends and I) on the menu despite there being photos and reviews of salmon and shrimp bowls. Where did they go?! I would understand if they ran out for the day, but those options were nowhere to be found on the menu. Still, we decided to give this place a chance... 

I am newly vegetarian/pescatarian (on most days) but my husband proceeded to order a bowl. We decided on the beef/gyudon bowl; half salad and half brown rice with a soft egg (unfortunately $1 extra) and the \"house special\" black pepper sauce. I wish I took a photo of the menu because a bracket [{] made it seem as if the \"house special sauce\" was black pepper AND garlic sauce, and I did want and asked for both (I didn't mind paying another $1 extra for extra sauce bc I'm a sauce kind of girl) but the girl taking our order told me I couldn't do that (EVEN THOUGH the sign indicated $1 for extra sauce), so I didn't push it to save my dollar. They were also out of the apple milk tea that I really wanted to try, so I went with black currant. Just these 2 things alone (bowl + milk tea) cost us $14+... in my head, I was hoping and praying that this bowl would be well worth it...

.... about 15-20 minutes later our food came out. There were two small parties who ordered before us, however my husband noticed that our bowl was done for awhile before being called out. My poor husband stood there waiting for someone to hand him our food that whole time. Though we appreciate how freshly made the bowls were, he and a friend witnessed that they were taking their sweet time putting together each ingredient and even cutting each piece of meat very very slowly. You would think they would have a quicker system, especially when they're busier?! We still thought, okay, this must taste good though. But dang it, it was very underwhelming and bland. I ate around the meat but expected the sauce to give the salad, rice and egg some ummph and flavor, and I kept waiting and waiting for it but it never came. Also, we didn't feel that the full-sized portion we ordered was nearly enough for the price. Sad to say but both my husband and I were so unsatisfied, that we had to order something else from another food establishment at Mekong.

From the inconsistency of the photos and reviews, I'm guessing this place is still trying to figure out what works for them and I sure hope they do soon and that they bring back the seafood options because I like the concept but found it to be very disappointing from expectation to reality. Hopefully I just came on a bad night but sadly because of their lack of options for me and steep prices, I'm not sure if I would come back. Darn..."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Very filling despite the fact that bowl is quite small for a full size. Clean but their space is a little small. We had a Groupon when we went here. I ordered gyudon (the one in front) while my husband ordered the steak with garlic butter sauce. We also ordered onigiri and early milk tea-which was also very good. The only down side that I can see is that it is a little expensive for the price."}
{"text":"I ordered online, my estimated wait time was 15 minutes, after about 30 minutes I still hadn't received a text saying my order was done. When I went to pick up the food was already at room temperature. As far as taste goes I wasn't blown away."}
{"text":"Tonight we tried Kingo Bowl at the Mekong Market on Dobson and Main in Mesa. Man was it good!

Okay, so think sort of Chipotle style choose what things go in your Japanese-ish bowl style of ordering. They have an easy to use diagram menu board on the wall just above the counter to make it easy. The staff will also walk you through the process when you tell them you're there for the first time. The staff is amazing, by the way!

First you pick a base: white or brown rice, or a salad, or half and half. Then you choose a meat: beef, chicken, gyudon (sukiyaki marinated beef), chicken curry, or half and half of any two. Then you pick a sauce: garlic butter, black pepper, sweet and spicy, teriyaki, or thousand island, again, you can do half and half, too. You can top it with a hard boiled orpoached chicken egg or 4 quail eggs. Then you choose 2 sides: veggies, crispy onion flakes, sunflower seeds, cranberries, or Japanese pickles.

The kicker is their proteins are cooked in a sous vide! OMG! The steak was so tender, so delicious, and a perfect compliment to the sauces! Hubby and I both got rice with beef, and went half and half on the garlic and black pepper sauces, which were a perfect compliment to one another. I got the crispy onion flakes and veggies. He got the Japanese pickles and veggies. He had a poached egg, I didn't get an egg. It was all delicious!
I had water to drink, hubby had a cold earl grey milk tea that was delicious!
Here's the kicker, we brought 6 other food adventurers with us to try the place out. It's a tiny place with a 4 top and a 2 top tables I side of it. Luckily, it's adjacent to the Mekong food court, so I was able to go grab a couple tables to seat all 8 of us.

When we ordered, we let the gal behind the register know we hadn't been there before, and that we had brought a bunch of people to try it. She was kind, patient, surprised, and happy to see a line out the door. I think she may have been the owner. She is delightful.
With 8 of us, we tried a little bit of everything. Nothing was bad! We all said we would come back and have it again. A couple of the guys said they have a new lunch place to add to their rotation.

As we finished up our meals, one of the guys on staff came out to our tables with a couple of slices of cheesecake for all of is to share as a thank you for coming in and bringing so many people. That was amazingly generous and kind. The cheesecake was quite delicious!
Kingo Bowl is in a great place on a corner as you enter the food court at Mekong. If you want something other than milk tea or water to drink, you go to another vendor, like the boba tea place. There's also a bakery and the boba tea place does shaved ices, and it's all in close proximity.

My wife and I were talking in the car on the way home about how tender the meat was, how good those sauces were, and the different toppings and sauces we want to try next. Although, it's going to be hard to not get the half and half of garlic/black pepper sauces. We may already be addicted to them!

It was a fun evening out with adventurous friends and good food. What more could you ask for. We recommend going and giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Kingo Bowl is located within an Asian shopping center.  It's not visible from outdoors and does not have a drive-thru.  Expect to jockey for a parking spot on busy Sundays to walk inside.

The restaurant is neat and clean, though small with limited seating.  You may need to look for a table just outside in the mall area (similar to a food court).

The service was fast and friendly.  The woman who took the order explained the offerings well and even came back to ask if everything was ok.  I said it was, but actually, I wasn't thrilled.

The advertisements (including a poster in the front window) display the steak bowl topped with an egg.  When placing the order I was told it would be $1.00 extra.  (Pass!). The steak was well seasoned, but a bit rare for my taste and a little grizzly.  A choice of dressings is available to top the bed of lettuce which was just average.  At $12.00, I expected a better bowl."}

{"text":"Seriously tastes so good! I love the portion size. They give lots of meat and rice. Enough to fill you up. Very flavorful, and it's nice and neat inside. I saw them I believe boiling meats, not frying. So definitely the healthier option to these types of foods! I wish the cashier girl was more personable though. She didn't have much enthusiasm to us first timers... but other than that definitely will be coming back for the food. :)"}

 then  $1 extra for rice on \"rice bowl\",

2  portion is  too small even to feed a child
3. pepper sauce, too spicy to taste beef flavor."}

I ordered steak and kalbi... the steak was beyond over cooked the kalbi only had bones.   The entire meal was very bland! The mushroom was even a disaster...what? White mushroom? No flavor at all.  The fried onion was definitely store bought so don't even talk about that... so disappointing...i looked forward to it just looking at the picture... and then the price...over priced .... it is definitely not going to pass school cafeteria standards"}
{"text":"Kingo Bowl came up on my Uber Eats App. It looked really good so I thought I would give it a try. I got a rice bowl with chicken, soft hot spring egg, Japanese pickled cucumber, and fired red onions with a side of sweet and spicy. 

Overall the Bowl was good. But it didn't WOW me. Not saying I wouldn't go back but it isn't something that I must have again right away. The Bowl was kind of small so it wasn't too filling. But taste and presentation were good."}
{"text":"Ok I an writing my first review because I am so pissed off right now. This is my second visit to Kingo Bowl. I ordered a to-go steak bowl because I really liked their chiken bowl last time. The picture looked great and I thought it'd be even better.

I came home and realized, they gave me a twice smaller bowl. Seriously I was shocked. I looked up Yelp and my memory was correct; they gave me a smaller bowl for charging 9.99 plus tax. (Smaller size is $5.80 something). There was no one else in the store so they weren't busy at all (it was arouns 6:30). I am not sure if why they did it but I wouldn't have known it if it was my first visit.

As I see other people posting pics of their meal, mine looks significantly bad compared to others. Theirs look like what I had last time. But this time, the steak is extremely thin that my mom asked if I ordered Gyudon or something. It is overcooked that it looks like the picture from their advertisement. I wouldn't even pay $5 to  get a couple slices of beef and a small bowl of rice. 


I can only assume that they did not have an enough ingredients to make one bowl like last time (when I went last time, they told me they are out of Gyudon even it was early in the morning) .. but I don't understand why th IPey didn't tell me to come back another time instead of charging me full price. 


Overall, extremely disappointed. I was very satisfied at my first visit but I would never go back to this place. But I wonder what made their quality decreased so much over a few months."}
{"text":"Wow. This is in the Mekong Plaza food court and it's the BOMB. Get a gyudon bowl with a spring egg, you won't regret it. Love the customizable options."}
{"text":"Came here to use our Groupon. Very friendly and helpful staff! We ordered a steak bowl with white rice and the pepper sauce. The sauce was very flavorful and the steak was amazing! 
I felt like the price was a little high for the portion though that's why 1 less star for this review. 
Next time I'm going to try the milk tea! Was a little disappointed they didn't offer fountain drinks. It since it was in the food court, there are other ways to get a coke."}
{"text":"What a great concept! I recently acquired my own sous vide as a gift and love it. This places rocks surprised ther haven't been more sous vide places popping up. If you're in the area don't pass this this up with most def worth a try. So far my favorite dish is the half and half brown half salad with the steak. I add a 32C soft sous perfect egg and garlic butter mixed with their house sauce. 

PS they also have a limited seasonal menu so be sure to look at the temporary signs"}
{"text":"OMYummmmmm!! What a great addition to Mekong plaza. Everything is cooked sous vide. Really...Who would have thought that there would be Molecular gastronomy in an Asian cultural center?? I had the gyudon bowl with a spring egg. So good! Whatever you get...do yourself a favor and get the egg!"}
{"text":"Got the gyudon bowl with brown rice, a hot spring egg, mixed veggies, and fried onions. It was amazingly delicious! I also had the Apple milk tea which was also delicious, but the portion was quite small and so the milk tea disappeared before I even got my bowl. The total came out to be around $13. I split the bowl with the bf who ate it voraciously while I had to fight to get some. I guess we both enjoyed it and shouldn't have shared to begin with. 

The girl who took our order was really friendly and said that the food would take a while since they were pretty busy. It didn't take super long. There were no tables available inside so we just sat in the food court which was no big deal. 

It was slightly pricey for a somewhat small portion  (probably got like 5 pieces of vegetables for the mixed veggies), but I would definitely come get another bowl when I'm grocery shopping again. And next time I won't share."}
{"text":"Kingo Bowl's motto is \"Healthier, tastier, faster\". The meat they offer is cooked in a sous vide then sliced and packaged to order. The actual shop is located where a crepe shop/bakery used to be, before the food court.

They offer two sizes of bowls and currently have beef, pork and chicken protein options with a limited time beef tongue bowl ($5.99 base price for small). Since it was offered for a short time I figured why not? It was sliced thinly, and you have your choice of rice, salad or both, mix ins, and sauce. Note that the beef tongue doesn't come with sauce and is lightly seasoned. I had it with brown rice ($2 extra), pickles and fried onion. 

For the most part the beef tongue was tender, although there were some pieces that were a little hard/tough. The seasoning was spot on for me, just enough to highlight the flavor of the beef. The pickles were a crunchy punch of savory salty flavor and the fried onions were the kind you can get at the Asian grocery store. The brown rice base was a little overcooked and mushy for my tastes, not worth the extra $2 in my opinion. The bowl itself tasted OK but for the price I paid I would have liked some fresh vegetables or more variety of toppings to choose from. I suppose part of the cost factors in the sous vide style of cooking but for the price I paid I could make something similar at home (I'm a food nerd and have a sous vide).

I also got an Earl Gray milk tea. It was refreshing and lightly sweet. It comes premade with no mix ins.

The shop has very limited seating, maybe 2 tables so getting your order to go and either taking it home or eating it at the food court is most likely your best bet.

Overall it was a decent meal but I wasn't so impressed that I'd go out of my way to try another bowl."}
{"text":"Ordered online. Got to the place, was told they were out of Curry Chicken. Said the regular chicken would be fine. They came out about 6 minutes later to tell me there were out of vegetables too. I made substitutions. Essentially walked out with something entirely different than I ordered. Was offered no concession. Poor experience."}
{"text":"Good, cheap, healthy! Thats how they sell themselves and that's exactly what they are. It offers a good alternative to the everyday routine and a relaxed environment"}
{"text":"This is a new rice bowl that just opened up in the Mekong food plaza. If you walk in through the right entrance and just keep going forward, you can't miss it. 

So after passing by it twice, I found it. It is a cozy little spot with a small two person table and a long six person table with a couch on one side. It was nice a relaxing to sit on the couch and eating my food. It reminded me of eating at home where it was really strict and we had to eat on the dinner table... but when my parents went out, I would eat on the couch and watch TV. 

As for the food, I ordered a brown rice bowl with full chicken, fried onions, sunflower seeds, a hard boiled egg and sweet and spicy sauce. It was good. Nothing special, but delicious nonetheless. I also a bottle of their bottled milk tea. It was supposedly imported from Taiwan, but I guess that is why it was good!

I would come back to place if I was shopping in Mekong and hungry. I would probably get salad instead of rice next time, maybe try their sukiyaki next time. Maybe their onion sauce. Who knows."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken bowl and a Hawaii iced tea! it was very tender and juicy and delicious!!I'll definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Probably the BEST sous vide restaurant I have been to.. ok so it is the only one I've been to, but don't hold that against it. 

Love the consistency of the food, if you've had sous vide method cooking, you will know what I'm talking about. The flavors are also amazing, the combination of the pepper sauce with fried onion or cranberry on top of the seasoned steak fished off with a perfect egg is genius. 

The selection is pretty good for food that takes so long to prepare (it doesn't take long after you order, but they start cooking it long before you show up) they even have skewers that they flash torch for crispness in front of you.. and some delicious homemade milk teas (I hope they bring their monogrammed bottles back) 

I'll keep coming here, you should check it out too."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Wham! - Wake Me Up Before You Go Go)

Yelp it up before you Kingo
Don't leave me salivating like a dingo
Yelp it up before you Kingo
I don't want to miss it when you try that bowl
Yelp it up before you Kingo
Cause I'm not planning to going solo


Kingo Bowl is a new concept for me and it's definitely intriguing.  

Sous Vide cooked steak and chicken in a rice bowl!  Dressed up and served like a poke bowl; a Kingo bowl goes through that same process.  The day I attended they ran out of brown rice so I went for their white rice and salad base.  For my protein I was told if it's my first time go for the Gyudon; a marinated shredded beef, which didn't require me to pick a sauce.  For my extra sides I shot for the dried cranberries, fried crispy onions, and an egg.  

Overall, I thought I did pretty well for my first run at it.  The Gyudon tasted like it had a sukiyaki marinade with a salty and sweetness pop.  My crispy onions gave my bowl some needed texture while the cranberries added a subtle gummy chewiness.  The egg helped jell everything together making my bowl a hot mess of goodness!  

In the end, Kingo Bowl is different and something we all can appreciate and try.  It's the first of it's kind in the valley and I'm excited to go back for round 2! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent believe the man at the front was named Sky. He immediatly recognized me and greeted me with a welcome back. The food is absolutely delicious definitely a different twist then the normal rice bowl places u will go to. At first the fact that the food was not piping hot confused me at first but it made it extremely easy to eat. So tasty that I forget to take a before picture! Will definitely come back trying the gyudon with spring egg to die for"}
{"text":"I went there to try it for the first time.  I couldn't decide what meat to chose from so the cashier said they? could do half of each.  My bill came out to almost $12.00 from originally $7.00!!!  She said she charged me for 2 half orders! Which sounds ridiculous to me, then it'd be one full order which I originally ordered.  It's a total rip off and the food wasn't great and certainly not worth $12.00 for a bowl!"}
{"text":"The chicken bowl was amazing. This was my first time having sous vide meats and it was amazing. The chicken was perfectly tender. The sauces I tried were teriyaki and black pepper, they were both great but I preferred the teriyaki. I also tried the milk tea and it wasn't too sweet and very refreshing. I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Update: The owner took my yelp review seriously and immediately attempted to make my experience better. They offered me 2 freshly made bowls which were made fresh, and told me that they will continue to make bowls at the time of order. I really appreciate the owner's kindness, as she really tried to lighten the situation. However, my boyfriend and I still think the rice bowls are a no from us. We have tried the steak, salmon, and chicken, and did not really like the way any of the meat and bowls tasted. I mostly just ate the rice.  There are better places to spend your money and get better tasting food.

Previous review: I forgot to take photos because I was too hungry and excited to try this place out.

I think the idea of a grab-and-go restaurant is a great idea IF you have the customers for it. It was around 6:30 pm and there were 2 couples already eating their food, but there was probably 4-6 of each rice bowl pre-made. (There was not 12+ people waiting in line to eat. Waste of food)

I wanted the steak bowl ($11.99), and the presentation of the layered steak and soft egg was nice, but I was already apprehensive to eat the bowl because I had no idea what time they were made. I don't feel comfortable thinking about how long the egg and meat were sitting out, and I think it's a health code violation if you don't label the items with the time they were prepared at. The bowls could have been sitting out for 4 hours for all I know. Gross, but I still decided to try the food. My fault. The worker asked if I wanted the food heated up and I said sure. She then proceeded to put the bowl in the microwave for a couple of minutes.

I only took a few bites before I threw the whole thing away.  For $11.99, I should be getting freshly made food. The steak was grey and microwaving the food is like microwaving leftovers, which I could have done at home. 


My boyfriend ordered the salmon bowl and also felt uncomfortable eating the food. 

There is no need for a grab-and-go option if you don't have the customers and traffic to support it. 

I'm giving 2 stars because this place does have potential if they made the food at the time of order, and also because my bf said not to give it one star. 

I won't be coming back"}
{"text":"The chicken curry combo was amazing.  Perfect spices and tender chicken.  Large portion sizes and friendly staff.  Quick service.  Adding this to my \"go back\" list!"}
{"text":"Really really good food, and the price for it is great!!! I truly recommend this place if your passing by the area :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place for dinner tonight and was surprised at just how great it was! My boyfriend had a brown rice/salad bowl with chicken, hard boiled egg, and onions, with sweet & spicy sauce on the side. He's not a foodie, not usually big on Asian food in general, and doesn't exhibit much enthusiasm for even his most favorite foods. This meal elicited an unusually high level of enthusiasm from him. Which is great, because I really loved it too! For myself I ordered a white rice bowl with gyudon, a spring egg, onions and a side of pepper sauce. I found the flavor of the gyudon to be particularly enjoyable. 

I ordered our meals online at around 6pm on a Friday, picked them up 10 minutes later with no wait. Price was on the high-ish side, but in my opinion was worth it. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Initially wanted to try this place out because I liked the concept. I ordered half salad and half brown rice Gyudon; however, I receive a bowl with only a little bit of salad and the bulk of it filled with soggy brown rice. As far as taste of the meat, it was okay.  Pickles and veggies were good. I just really had a hard time getting passed the rice. Hoping this place can step it up on the execution, because it's a great idea!"}
{"text":"Sous Vide was leveraged well to make a pleasing bowl combo with tender beef and a perfect egg... A little pricey for the portions but then again... I eat too much as it is ... 

Only drawback is no tea without sugar... seems a no brainer but oh well

I'd eat here again"}
{"text":"This place serves up some really good food.  The restaurant itself is located in the Mekong Plaza by the food court.  Not much seating inside the restaurant, there's a large table and a couple of small tables, but they also had a couple of small tables just outside the entrance.  I had the full order of steak, half white rice/half salad, spring egg, fried onions and pickles with a side of black pepper sauce.  Wow!  The flavors complemented each other so well.  I wasn't sure about the Japanese pickles at first, but get them, they are not overpowering and the taste reminds me a little of the ginger you get with your sushi.  I also got the apple milk tea which they claim is made with real sugar, real milk and is lactose free!  And I can confirm that it is in fact lactose free being a person that needs to take a Lactaid every time I eat or drink anything with dairy in it, I was pain free.  My husband was also very happy with his meal and we are definitely going to be keeping this in our rotation."}
{"text":"Gentlemen at cash register was super helpful! Informed me of the intricacies of making the bowl (which was delicious). It's custom made to your liking. Bowl one was beef with brown rice, mixed veggies and pickles.  meat was well flavored and items were fresh. Bowl two was curry chicken and their special made chicken, half brown rice and half salad with mixed veggies and pickles.  meat was tender and well seasoned. Didn't need any sauce. Wish we had one in the Bay Area  would come back if I came back to AZ."}
{"text":"Gave Kingo Bowl a shot today after walking by and seeing the sign. I ordered the beef bowl with black pepper sauce to go. The picture was a beautiful medium rare looking piece of meat. What I got was medium well and a little on the dry side. I probably should have asked if I could have a more rare piece. I really enjoyed the crunch of the pickles and the black pepper sauce though. Service was quite nice, I just wish my meal was prepared a little quicker. It took about 30 minutes to assemble my bowl. I'd try it again, but I'd ask for a rare cut if at all possible"}
{"text":"had a very plesant experience. food was delicious.  had a half steak half kalbi rib bowl with fried onoins, an egg, pickles and mushroom. I thought while the flavors are familiar its a pleasant change from your average American diet. steak was delicous and cooked well for a fast casual restaurant. really liked all the condiments and garnishes that really elevate the steak and rice. staff was very nice and friendly. I hope to be back soon"}
{"text":"I was really glad to find this new place at Mekong.  The menu is pretty simple, but the food is very tasty.  My wife and I tried the steak, chicken, and Gyudon (sukiyaki beef) in rice bowls.  It's nice that they let you do 1/2 and 1/2 so that you can try multiple meats.  We loved each one.  The flavors were savory and delicious.  It really surprised us both.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  I tried the black pepper sauce, and my wife tried the garlic butter sauce.  But we both agreed the flavors of the meats were so good that the sauce (given on the side) was not even necessary and we didn't use much of it.

I will definitely be back, loved the food."}
{"text":"Came here from a recommendation from a friend. 

It's inside MeKong Plaza towards the Dim Sum restaurant. 

Small space. Probably can only fit 11 people. 

You get to choose your base, protein, and whether you want pickles .50 or soft egg $1

The concept of sous vide was interesting to me when I first saw their sign outside, and when I entered. However once I received my meal, it was underwhelming

The steak was definitely fresh but what was lacking was how thin the slices were. 

Ordered the black pepper sauce and it was on the salty side. Far too salty."}
{"text":"I love finding new interesting, delicious, and healthy eats.  Not to mention the geek in me finds the sous vide cooking method very interesting.  First timers need to try the steak bowl with the black pepper sauce.  The steak is tender and flavorful and the pairing with the black pepper sauce is an amazing combination.  Add a hot spring egg and some fried red onions too.  The atmosphere is very casual and staff is friendly and helpful to first timers.  Located inside the Mekong plaza.  Give them a try!!!"}
