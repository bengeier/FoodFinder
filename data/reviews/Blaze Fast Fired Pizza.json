{"text":"Wonderful pizzas with delicious fresh ingredients. Very pleasant service and speedy pizza cooking time. Gotta try the smore's desert and the blood orange lemonade. Very great value too.. unlimited topping for 7.95!"}
{"text":"Quick and easy ordering. Service was alright. Everyone seemed like they did not want to be there. After eating at Pieology many times before, Blaze Pizza wasn't anything special for me. Good place to go if you want quick and easy pizza. Prices aren't bad at all."}
{"text":"Got a byo pizza and a side salad. Everything was delicious until I found a hair mixed in to my tomato mozzarella salad. Absolutely disgusted. Extremely dissapointed, I really thought I found my new favorite. Workers should be made to wear hair nets. Staff also sloppily puts toppings on pizza mixing meat into the veggie options."}
{"text":"I LOVE Blaze pizza.  I especially love the Decatur location of Blaze pizza here in town (see my other review of that store in particular).  But this location on Durango needs some serious help in the service department.  We have given them a try 4-5 times now and every single time the service has left a lot to be desired.  

Today I went to go pick up my online order (which should only take a couple minutes) and the cashier was so overwhelmed with trying to figure out how to handle a customer complaint that she literally left the cash register and didn't come back for several minutes.  All the other employees were standing around, looking at the growing line and shrugging their shoulders going \"We don't know where she went.\"

That was only one of the several stupid things I witnessed during my 15-minute struggle to get my online order picked up.  I don't care how much closer this location is to my house... I will definitely drive a few minutes more to go to the Decatur location from now on."}
{"text":"Just opened down the street from home and it is SOOOOO GOOD!!!  Not only is the pizza consistent and delicious, but the service is impeccable!  It's easy to see that Blaze uses quality, fresh ingredients and every time I've been in, there is plenty of staff ready to make a top-notch pizza!  My husband and I love grabbing a pizza (usually just 1 to share - the portions are generous) and will likely be in once a week!"}
{"text":"Blaze was quick to respond to my concerns. Tonight was exceptional. Staff was fast and so friendly. Young lady at the beginning of the order process was phenomenal. Personable and energetic even at 15 minutes prior to closing. Hats off to the team! Blaze is a great company & nobody beats the taste and quality of their pizzas."}
{"text":"Tried BLAZE last night for the first time. This is not \"authentic\" Italian pizza. It is not meant to be either. It is great tasting fairly priced pizza, located conveniently near by. Huge amount of toppings and cheeses, generously doled out with a friendly smile. The folks behind the counter were friendly, well trained and appeared to enjoy what they were doing. So unlike lots of places in town, these young people seemed to have pride in their product and their work.They have been well trained. Only one thing was lacking. My wife and I were both very disappointed to learn that at the end of the ordering process and while paying for our order, we get the news that they were out of wine. We are retired seniors and enjoy wine with our meals. Being OUT of wine is an indication on a Saturday evening shortly before 6 PM of poor management.
Not that there is a shortage of vino in the area between the liquor stores and supermarkets minutes away in the same center. At the very least there should have been an appropriate sign in view prior to having customers wait In line to place their order and then only at the end to learn there is no wine in house. We will go there again but inquire about wine availability BEFORE we get on line. One thing further.....we went without getting a coupon.We have signed up on the site and hope for coupons in the future. Mangia !!!"}
{"text":"I just had to create a yelp account to share my experience at Blaze Pizza!!! My wife and I walked in to order a few pizzas and the line was pretty long. I didn't mind waiting in line because I was really eager to try blaze for the first time. The order taker was very polite and took the time to explain the menu. Sam proceeded to greet me with a smile and asked me and my wife what kind of sauce we wanted on our pizzas. Sam was very efficient when it came to the sauce and cheese. She made sure the cheese looked ok for us and thanked us as we followed our pizzas down the line. When we got to veggies, Shayla politely greeted us with a smile and asked what kind of veggies we wanted. She thoroughly worked on worked on both of our pizzas at the same time and made sure we had all the veggies we needed. She thanked us with a smile and directed us to the register. Even when we got to the register, she still made sure we got everything we asked for. Someone on the line left our side of olives and she made sure we didn't forget it. For a first time, this was a great experience at Blaze Pizza and I can't wait to come back for more!!!! Especially if Sam and Shayla are on the line!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing pizza! My second time eating at Blaze and I'm convinced this is my new regular stop! The price is affordable and who can beat unlimited toppings for no charge! I love the Aguas too! Definitely give this place a try...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is good and staff works hard. They need to figure out a better method to handling a rush of customers. Waited in line for an hour."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Since someone felt the need to tell me that \"they weren't slow on \"Pi day, the customers just didn't know what to order because they were all new,\" let me just reiterate that while their Pi day wait was exceptionally long (2.5 hours for a relatively short line), their wait time is ALWAYS horrendously long. Always. I have literally gone when there are fewer than 10 people in front of me and it still takes 30 minutes just to get to the place where I order. I have watched the employees MULTIPLE times take their time. They are very slow and I don't know if it's because they are new, not well trained, or have been trained to be slow, but it's definitely not solely the customer's fault. In fact, it has been my experience that most people seem to already know what they want to order. But even if there are customer's who don't know what they want to order before they get to the front, it seems that if you're consistently having that problem and it's significantly increasing your wait time, then you should figure out a solution. Have a larger menu, have signs encouraging guests to have their order ready, offer menus so people waiting in line can plan, have signs explaining how the process works. Lots of potential solutions. Don't sit there and blame the customers. Do something about it. 

I actually went a few days ago because they offered double flame day. That was when there were fewer than 10 people in front of me and it took 30 minutes to get to where I could take my order. When I walked in, I was pleasantly surprised at the short line (had it been any longer, I would have just left). And then it took 30 minutes. To get through less than 10 orders. I shouldn't have been surprised.

Anyway, in case you're just wondering if my experience on Pi day was an isolated incident or a serial offense, I'm just updating to say this happens every single time. So buyer beware, if you're going to Blaze, be prepared for a longer wait than you're expecting. Really no less than 30 minutes + 5-10 minutes to get your food.  

----------------


I love Blaze pizza, their pizzas are delicious, and totally worth it. However, the reason for my low review is that the wait time is ALWAYS absolutely horrendous. Even when it's a short line, it takes way too long to get people thru. I don't know if it's just this location or what, but every time I've gone to Blaze at this location, the staff are just incredibly slow, making the wait long. 

I think this location did not have Pi day planned out well. I anticipated a long wait, but I didn't anticipate this. We waited 1.5 hours, and we were still over an hour away from ordering. So if we had stayed, we would have ended up waiting 2.5-3 hours. You'd think they'd be prepared, since they were offering pizzas for $3.14, but clearly they were not. Bummer. 

And yes, I do acknowledge that any time a company has a great deal going on, there's going to be a longer than normal wait. But I'm pretty sure literally every other similar style restaurant (Cafe Rio, Chipotle, Zupas, etc.) would've had their stuff together & gotten people thru quicker. 

I guess I just keep hoping this place gets better with their wait times, but I'm pretty much givin"}
{"text":"I write this review now, based off an experience I had awhile ago... 1/20/17 to be exact. This was before I started yelping and I actually sent in an email to the specific location on that night, but never received a reply or acknowledged. REGARDLESS, the reason I write this review is because I could not let an employee go un-noticed. I have worked in a fast pace pizza joint myself and I know the stress employees are under. 

My family made an order and my mom being the overachieving mom she is- she got a salad for her meal because she is trying to be healthier. Well, when I picked up the order and went home there was no salad. She was DEVASTATED because she worked all day and just wanted her salad. So being the marvelous daughter I am... (; I drove back for her. 

An employee -Glenn- greeted me immediately to ask what was wrong. He heard my concern ((which was calm and polite because again I've been in this position and they were so busy) and made it his personal priority to stop what he was doing to ensure I got what I needed. He was attentive, worked with a purpose and had a great attitude about it. The manager then came over and offered some words as well as a free pizza card. (This wasn't necessary at all, but they insisted). 

This was my first time ever to Blaze and I will be back again JUST FOR this great service. 

Mistakes are meant to be made, and it happens. 
More people need to realize this. But if you can acknowledge a mistake with grace and handle it... you're an even better employee than someone who does something perfect every time."}
{"text":"High rise crust, BBQ sauce, mozz and ricotta. Ham, bacon, garlic, red pepper. Delicious down to the very last bite. 

My girlfriend and I initially came to this location one night after work because we wanted to try it. Little did we know it was one of their very first few days of being open so the line was out the door and into the parking lot- kind of a madhouse. We decided to try one of the other locations (Decatur) but that line was out the door too! We were hungry so we were going to wait through that line, if it was that long the food has to be good right? Right!

Fast-forward a few weeks after this location's opening, and we've come several times (2? 3??) and the pizza, service, and atmosphere are all reasons we can't stop coming back! 

The prickly pear agua-fresca is a unique drink option along with their selection of lemonades and Blue Sky cane sugar soda. Prices are decent, we get out at around $23 for two pizzas- one on a high rise (+$2) and two soft drinks. 

There's a loyalty program/punchcard app but I'm not sure how to use it and gain stamps/flames but I'm sure I'll figure it out some day! Came today for lunch but will of course be back!"}
{"text":"I feel Like they have entirely way to many people working in there. It's more like a high school prom then a restaurant. I think management needs to evaluate the talent and weed out the slacking ones. I'm a store manager and I'm telling you they are wasting a ton of payroll. 
The pizza I thought was great for the value. I liked the ceaser salad as well, ,, the lemonades are good. I will go back. Great tasting pizza!!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today after being recommended by a friend. OH MY GOD. This place is amazing. If you are looking for a fun place with friends, or a fun date night, this is the place to go. You can customize your own pizza and it is not expensive. They offer a military discount, so I left with a good sized pizza for $8. You can't beat that. You'll love it!"}
{"text":"This place is filthy! The windows havn't been dusted or cleaned. Bugs flying.  The staff is sweeping the floor at the same time as placing the pizzas in the oven. The floor needs  washing. There doesn't seem to be any management in charge. However,  the food tastes great and the young staff has good customer service skills. Just hope we don't get sick afterwards."}
{"text":"This is an \"interesting\" pizza experience. Be ready for a wait. Be ready for a lot of hands on your pie. Went in because of the coupon. Line was out the door the first time we tried to visit.  This second time there was still a long line. Somebody must like it, but we won't be going back. It's not a bad place. Just not my cup of tea. Think Chipoltle for pizza on how the place is set up. Definitely skews younger as far as atmosphere. We went with the basic Meat Eater pizza. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't an emotional experience either.  Pretty sure the place has staying power. It's in the old Sammy's Wood fired location. I'd recommend giving it a try. Some will love it. Others will be more like me. Meh ."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Great options for ingredients. My only complaint was that I prefer a crispier crust. I'll request \"well done \" next time."}
{"text":"My husband and I thought we would give this place a try and we loved it. You can make your own pizza or chose from their menu. Price was great, food was better."}
{"text":"The pizza at Blaze is absolutely delicious! The ovalini mozzarella, ricotta, and roasted red peppers are so fresh, just a few of my favorite items to put on my pizza! Such friendly and fast service. Kelley was extremely nice and made my visit a pleasant one. Will definitely come back to this location!"}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with Blaze Pizza?! I love this place! 

They have a very simple menu with delicious pizzas!  My favorites are the bbq chicken (grilled chicken, mozzarella, red onion, banana peppers, gorgonzola, bbq sauce) and white top (white mozzarella cream sauce, bacon, garlic, oregano, arugla).  Delicious!!  You can also make your own pizza.  I like that it's a set price - $8.95.  My husband and I always get a pizza each, and we take home 4 or 5 slices - best leftovers ever.

The s'more pie dessert is the bomb!! Get it warmed up, trust me!  The service is great as well.  Cheap, fast, and delicious.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"The food and service here are top notch! It's one of those popular brick-oven pizza joints where you choose your crust (regular, thick, gluten-free), sauce (pesto, Alfredo, marinara), cheese (including both fresh AND shredded mozzarella, feta, goat, and more), and toppings. They're generous with ingredients if you request it. Your creation pops into the oven and you're eating about five minutes later. 

There is only one pizza size--individual/personal. 

Blaze offers a rewards program via an app. For each pizza you order, you receive one \"flame.\" Ten \"flames\" earns you a free pizza. Participation in the rewards program also earns you special offers (like discounts, a free drink, extra flames). 

The store was spotless and the service incredible! I was warmly greeted with smiles and real communication with employees. They stopped by my table several times to help if needed. Eric (the assistant manager?) was very positive and personable and seemed to reinforce this behavior in all his employees."}
{"text":"I went there for my first time yesterday and this place is addicting! The meat pizza, kale and quinoa salad...no words"}
{"text":"Have been to Blaze enough times now and felt it's time to leave them a much deserved 5 star review. 

Received a coupon in the mail for a free pizza, and after trying their product I have no doubt this is a marketing technique that is paying off for them. I have been back four or five times in the past month, as a paying customer.

The experience of making your pizza is extremely fun and easy. Choose as many ingredients as you want and watch them pile up. Extra cheese? No problem.

The staff is very pleasant and the atmosphere is light and relaxed. The store is always clean. The only negative is that sometimes the line can move slow and you spend more time than you'd like waiting for your pizza.

Highly recommend trying this place if you're ever nearby."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in years! Closest thing to true Italian pizza I've found and love it!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. But the employees were super slow when we went in there today. The guy taking the orders with the braids needs a hair net. They had no dough ready, no one making dough and it seemed like no one knew exactly what too do. They burned several pizzas as we waited. This is not the first time we've been in this restaurant, every other time it's been great. But this time was very disappointing."}
{"text":"The quality has went down and the workers are very lazy..Yesterdays visit sucked !!! North durango / Centennial hills"}
{"text":"3rd time here & we love it! 2nd time in 3 weeks n both times same young lady working on the line was chewing gum.  Not sure of her name, I think it starts with an M. In any case chewing gum in any food service establishment is a major health code violation. Some other girl also working on the line had a hair scrunchie around her wrist. I get that the pizzas cooked to 5 million degrees but I really don't want to ingest anyone else's DNA, it kinda grosses me out. Management should really b on top of this.  I will continue to come here because the pizza is amazing just as long as the gum chewing & hair scrunchie girls don't touch my food."}
{"text":"Literally as good as it gets for fresh pizza when you're a Vegan. So happy that they offer vegan cheese as well as a wide variety of veggie toppings. All of the young employees are friendly and fast. I will be coming to this restaurant again and again"}
{"text":"What's not to love about getting to make your own pizza?
 
Well almost! The only thing that could make this place even better is getting to put your own ingredients on your pizza but I would imagine some people ruining it for the others. But I like control :) 

There's a lot of great toppings to choose from and they even suggest a few of their own pizzas which I really enjoyed. The ingredients are fresh and I loved my pizza. You can literally choose whatever you want and split it however you please. 

And a big shout out to the s'more cookies that they'll heat up by the pizza oven for you. What a nice touch! 

Everyone making your pizza is very friendly and you get to watch it come together from start to finish."}
{"text":"Can't complain, great topings, choice of thick crust, a bit too friendly service.  Parking can be a bit tight."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Fast, efficient and tasty. I load my pizza up with a boat load of vegetables and I never get that famous teenage snarky attitude you might find all over town.  They must great their employees well. The gluten-free? crust was good and all, but if you're like me and like lots of toppings (especially wet veg toppings) I would not suggest it at all."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this jewel because of a coupon for a free pizza. As we arrived there was quite a line which we took as a good sign. After waiting, we ordered a build your own and salad. It was worth the wait. Our pizza arrived quickly and we were amazed! It was outstanding! We will be back!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant. WILL be back. Great quality, great ingredients, friendly staff.... they don't charge for extra cheese or a little bit of extra pepperoni like subway's fake ass does. It tastes soooo good."}
{"text":"I had a coupon in the mail since I bought a house in the area. I had seen them driving by so I thought why not and check it out. My friend and I went. On arriving at the counter I wasn't sure the process and the cashier girl was nice, but not real helpful. I would suggest that since its a fairly new concept to educate customers when they arrive. After that we got our toppings and everything looked fresh. Took it to go and when I got home the presentation was nice. It wasn't cut through and probably could have been cooked a little more but it tasted good. I will go back and try the raised dough. The price point was good and didn't have to wait long."}
{"text":"This is now my family's new favorite spot, there was no line, pizza ready in less then 10min, and tasted amazing. The fact we get to build our own with my complicated family was great....and I recommend the blood orange lemonade, drove my family crazy...."}
{"text":"If I could give different shifts different ratings, I totally would. 

In the past 4 months I have eaten at Blaze at least 3 or 4 times a month. (Yeah, I know, I know...) I try to go in the afternoons/evenings because that is when Asia is leading the shift. Any other time I have gone, the employees are either rude or seem... dead inside? And most of all, if Asia is not working, they WILL burn your pizza. Now some people like burnt food, but I prefer everything I eat to be just cooked (or even light cooked). The first couple months I ended throwing/giving away three pizzas. By the fourth one, I finally asked for a remake. Since then, if Asia sees me, she always checks the guy on the oven and I haven't had problems. 

Made the mistake of going in during the day earlier this week. Took forever even though there were only three people in front of me and no one behind. Had to deal with the same surly attitude (from some tall guy without a name tag)... Made sure to tell four different people to cook it light... and of course it came out burnt. I didn't have to say anything because even the employees were frustrated - I think they could see the disappointment in my face - and gave the guy on the oven a hard time. But yet again, I had a burnt pizza.

If you want a good experience, go early afternoon or late evening. However, if Asia is working, I will say the line will move fast even if it is out the door. (Day shift takes longer to make a pizza, even when there is literally no one in line! And all the pizzas still come out burnt, I just can't understand....)"}
{"text":"It is cheap and fast. Thats really about it. Service is good and it is barely more than fast food joints and better food."}
{"text":"Came here last night. The concept is like a chipotle or cafe Rio for pizza. The employees were all super nice! You can choose one their signature pizzas or make your own. We made our own pizza and the have several sauces and a bunch of toppings. Make it as healthy or unhealthy as your heart desires. Pizzas come out quick and PIPING HOT! My husband loves that the food is guaranteed to come out hot. The place was clean and service was quick. I wish the tables had napkins on it rather than finding the communal napkin station. Aguas frescas were delish and not too sweet. The pizzas are thin. The flavor was good. Not much of a crust, not the best pizza I have ever had in my life but we will def be back again. Probably more often than I would like to admit"}
{"text":"Decided to try out this place when I received a coupon for a free pizza when the place first opened. 5 stars to it because although they were busy, the workers were so friendly and helpful with me order due to me not having ever been to a Blaze pizza. Fast forward a few months, 6/5/17, I walk in around 6pm and the place is somewhat booming but no line. I get in line and the first guy to greet me was very nice and welcoming. The girl who stepped in next was very sarcastic and rude and overstepped the first guy, saying \"No!\"when I said I would like the thick crust pizza. She said about the first guy, \"he's just to nice to say no.\" Meanwhile the first guy held a smile and could tell he really did not appreciate the girls words. She then proceeded to criticize me for getting half of the classic red sauce with half spicy red sauce saying, \"what, can't handle the spicy one?\" In a very snooty tone. I dismissed it and continued. She then went on to help other guests and the next guy to help me did not seem to want to be bothered. He could have had a bad day, but still. He looked down the entire time and did not say a single word, making me feel awkward for basically speaking to myself. Not very personable. He then put my pizza in the oven and walked away. The cashier was friendlier than the rest and made small talk, which made me happy because at least not all of the employees were rude. My order was made to go in less than 10 minutes. Great pizza, bad employees. Will not be returning to this location...ever."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time with my family last Sunday. The line is packed! but we got our pizza fixed in a timely manner. The staff had great team work and the manager jumped in to help out. Price is affordable we all had a great time"}
{"text":"My son and I love blaze for lunch.  This place has become a little busy but it's worth it.  The drink options are many, the pizza great and the employees are friendly.  Kinda sucks that salads can't have other topping that what is provided but oh well"}
{"text":"My wife took me here after a long day at work, staff was so friendly and welcoming, loved the idea of choosing my own toppings and kind of dough.
Pro tip: get 2 sauces on your pizza, marinara in the center, garlic and basil on the crust."}
{"text":"Worth a try.  Very busy during dinner hour so ordering takes a bit.  Menu said beer $3-5 so I thought I'd be safe with a Coors Light for $3. Charged $5.  That was a bit ridiculous."}
{"text":"Now open! Just as good as the Decatur location. Love how they have more types of cheese and other toppings than other build your own pizza joints. Goat cheese!! Plus their crust is better. No matter how much you put on your pizza the crust is always crunchy."}
{"text":"It's literally a 50/50 shot if you get anything good.
It's not about business volume.  It's about staff being untrained, with a complete lack of respect."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! It's modern and brilliant. $8 to build your own pizza with as much of whatever you want on it. Service is quick and pleasant. 
Blaze Pizza has so much potential! I really hope they add more locations in the Summerlin (Cheyenne, lake mead, rampart) area."}
{"text":"This place is okay, if you don't mind waiting forever - in line and then waiting for your pizza. Be careful with the APP, our pizza's didn't have cheese.. who in their right mind would order pizza without cheese?! And when we got there to pick it up they didn't ask if we really didn't want cheese AND they waited until we showed up to cook it so don't bother putting in a pickup time, it won't be ready!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great food, convenient location, and under $10? Sign me up! No seriously, sign me up for their rewards program so I can earn a free pizza. You should too while you're at it. 

This location is much quieter than the echo-prone north Decatur location,  and offers better outdoor seating. I come here regularly to get my salad pizza fix - salad on top of your crust, best of both worlds!

Staff is friendly and the dining room and line area have been spotless each time I've been here. They also offer a great gluten free crust, and although i am not gluten free, I like the texture and appreciate having the option when my gluten free mom is visiting."}
{"text":"Really impressed by Blaze. I'd waited a while to give this place a shot, even though I live less than a mile away, but I'm glad I made the lunchtime trip on a whim. My only previous experience with \"fast-fired\" pizza was at a PizzaRev located in Henderson. I felt like it was just alright compared to what I'd heard, so I was hoping that the reviews here weren't just hype, and they definitely weren't! 

Highlights:
- The menu. Their suggested/specialty pizza menu has a good variety of tastes and serves as a helpful framework for exploring their options when you're a first-timer, like I was. 
-The dough. So, this is pretty much always going to be a preference thing, but I lean towards softer, thicker crusts when given the choice. The default crust here was a perfect balance between thin & crispy and doughy. 
- The pricing. I like simple pricing, so Blaze is right up my alley. $7.95 for as many toppings as you want. That's hard to beat. 
- The drizzles. At the end, you can add a complimentary drizzle over your pizza, and I was pleasantly surprised by how many options for drizzles there were! A great way to finish off the perfect pie :) 
- The space. I went during prime lunch rush time on a Wednesday and there was plenty of seating and the line paced really quickly. 

Stuff that wasn't my jam:
- If you're indecisive or a first-timer, you may feel a little rushed. The staff doesn't really make you feel that way, but with how fast the line moves, you may want to wait to step in line until you've got a good idea of where you at least want to start. 
- The seating area, while spacious and well set-up, looks to be geared towards bigger groups. So if you come solo or with a friend for a quick lunch, you might end up taking a big table and feeling bad about it when a family walks by. 
- Parking. There's just not a ton of spaces near the entrance. Granted, there's plenty of spots nearby, the ones right in front of Blaze are mostly handicapped spots. So, unless you've got that pass hanging from your rear view mirror, expect to walk a bit.

Overall, I loved my lunch at Blaze. Decent price, great taste, and great service from the staff. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good...been twice and the pizza is nothing incredible, but it is definitely tasty enough.  It is not super high end pie or anything but it is certainly not little Caesar's.  The price is acceptable for what you get...the place is not cheap but is not super expensive.  The main negative issue here is the wait.  We went to this place LITERALLY 3 times before we ate there...on each occasion we went in, waited anywhere from 2-5 minutes and decided to leave because the lines were ABSURD and moved terribly slow.  The staff is largely comprised of high school kids, which starts becoming problematic when you see them talking and BSing a ton.  I am all for having fun at work, but when you have lines almost to the door, you need to be working fast and not screwing around.  For a place that supposedly cooks your pizza in a matter of seconds practically, there is no real excuse for the line to move so slow.  We almost had written the place off entirely, but on the 4th try, the line was short enough that we managed to get through.  If I could get in and order lunch/dinner and be seated in under 10 minutes, it is the kind of spot that I would return to but with a line requiring 15 minutes PLUS just in line..no thanks.  Overall, the food is pretty good, if not great, but the waits and lines are severely off putting.  Maybe this will change over time."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time I had to wait in a super long line (when they first opened), food was great, but the staff weren't the nicest. I may not have ever went back because of them, if it weren't for the food. We thought we'd give it another chance yesterday. Luckily we didn't have to wait this time. The lady that was making my pizza, I didn't feel was the most sanitary, seeing how she had a ball of ricotta to put on it and halfway thru wiped her hands all over her apron and then started handling it again. (I couldn't tell just how clean it was since it had ricotta smeared all over it now) But the pizza yet again was delicious. I love that I can build my own pizza and put as many different toppings as they have available (and they have alot), without any extra fees. Pizzas are decently priced too. I think they're like $8 and they're enough for me to have 2 meals out of or my boyfriend to eat a whole one. Their blood orange lemonade is delicious too."}
{"text":"This pizza taste great! We ordered three pizzas and the total came out to $26. We ordered one pizza with pepperoni and sausage, an artichoke pizza, and a mushroom pizza. My favorite was mushroom! Great price and great taste! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm pretty heartbroken, I can't lie. We love the pizza here, and appreciate the vegan-ability of the options, but the last time we were here, we accidentally got bacon on our pizza. I understand that probably seems pretty silly to most omnivores, but it was borderline traumatic for us. Like, boom, dead animal smokehouse on your veggie pizza & 3 hrs of trying to wash the flavor/memory away.

I presume it happened because the veggie-section is done after the meat section, instead of vice versa, and some little stray bacon bit came along for the ride from somebody else's pizza into like, some spinach or whatever that we got.

I actually might cry, because this is the only pizza worth having this side of the Mississippi, and now I'll prolly have to settle.

Maybe use some tongs/a utensil for the veggies? I dunno. I'm just gonna go cry now."}
{"text":"Dude. Just go try this place. 
It's very similar to Pieology (build your own pizza) but it's better, they also have these smores cookies that are good, although a little dry. 
They also have a great selection of lemonade. Blood orange lemonade? Yes please! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The best pizza in town!! The service is excellent!!  100 % recommend. Green stripe is my favorite ."}
{"text":"Blaze has quickly become my favorite pizza spot in LV.  This new location is no different.  Located in the Smith's shopping center on Durango at Ellkorn, I witnessed more traffic here in one night than Sammy's and Table 89 had see their entire existence combined.  

This location is brighter than the other locations I have visited opting for the white exposed ceiling instead of the black cave like covering.  

Everything else is on par to the other Blaze locs in LV, freindly staff, quality ingredients, and fair pricing.  I will be visiting this place often and will be the Duke in no time.  Join the Blaze club to earn a free pizza after every 10 pies. YES!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is friendly and everything is clean. The pizza alone is amazing and great for the price. I recommend getting the white top and ass chicken. I had a wonderful experience and didn't have to wait long. If you come after 5pm there is a line but it moves pretty fast"}
{"text":"Wow! I just had what very well might have been the best pizza I've ever eaten. Matthew was really nice, and took his time placing the toppings, and putting the sauce on evenly. The amount of salt was perfect. I've been to other locations, but it wasn't nearly as good as this was. I know it's a bit silly to rave about the guy who put the toppings on, but honestly, Matthew, you should be a chef!"}
{"text":"Blaze is my favorite place to go for make your own pizza! The pizzas are delicious and I love their lemonades! The staff is always friendly and welcoming. Also love that they don't charge for extra toppings. I'm so happy they opened this new location in the Northwest!"}
{"text":"We tried this out a few days ago and it's awesome! They're made in front of you. You can tell them what you want and they bake it in the oven. It's fast and fresh."}
{"text":"We've been going to the one on Decatur and have been waiting for this one to open up. They have got the best gluten free crust I've had. It's crisp and chewy with no weird or cardboard taste. The regular crusts are thin and crispy, but you can get a double crust if you prefer. One of the things that makes this pizza is the sea salt sprinkle before it goes in the oven. Love adding the free arugula and balsamic drizzle after the pizza comes out of the oven. They've got BBQ, pesto and ranch drizzles as well. Besides the pizza, the blood orange lemonade is really good too. The salads are ok, haven't tried the desserts. A simple pie (marinara and cheese) is a little over $5, not bad."}
{"text":"Everyone here is super nice! As soon as I walked in I was greeted with a smile and a nice hello. It wasn't too busy when I went in so I was able to order right away. I did the build your own pizza but they also have signature pizzas that looked very delicious. Salads are also an option. Oh and they even have a vegetarian pizza! I love that they have a spicy marinara sauce (do wish it was a bit spicier) I also added the pesto sauce to my crust. They have lots of options for toppings. The service was great and I had my food within minutes! Love love love blaze pizza."}
{"text":"I like the thin crust and unique variety.  I also appreciate school nights. My school has had a lot of success using Blaze for fundraisers."}
{"text":"This was an excellent experience. The food was delicious and a lot for for what we paid.  We got to build our own pizzas and they were generous with the portions. It was clean and the staff was friendly. Shae was very attentive and amazing. She checked on us often to see if we needed anything. She has a friendly attitude and made us feel welcomed. We will definitely be coming back and letting our friends know."}
{"text":"We go here often, I appreciate the prices and the freshness. This place is clean, friendly staff. There's one girl that's a tad slow on the line but everyone works pretty well together."}
{"text":"I hate pizza but this is some of the best pizza I ever had. I usually order the white sauce build your own and load it with a bunch of different things. They're always super busy which sucks but they're super fast so it works out."}
{"text":"The workers are all nice, and the place is quite clean, but I might be leaning toward their competition now. I asked for a meat filled pizza from their app, and what I got was, once again, practically vegetarian! I was also disgusted to bite into more garlic cloves (that I did not order) than actual meat. Also, be warned that the time that you see on the app may not always be the time that you might get your pizza... Sometimes the wait is a problem, even when you order beforehand. I was definitely disappointed in my last pizza from there."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Tons of toppings and combination options. Gluten free crust is thin and crispy but tasty. Top your pizza with arugula and balsamic drizzle- it's fantastic! Blood orange lemonade is crazy good. But after 5 the lines are out the door and they move pretty slow. Plan ahead for standing in line 20-30 minutes minimum."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The food is pretty consistent. Pizza is either a lil burnt on the edges, soggy in the middle, or spot on. Most of the time it's pretty spot on. Good vegan options too! Workers are usually chill."}
{"text":"The best pizza ever. Way better than Pieology. Better ingredients. Friendlier service. Blaze is number 1 in my book for pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza, and I love being in control!  
I get the thick crust because it holds up better under all my toppings.  Crust has tasted better than ever lately, I think they improved it.  
It's a little loud in there and I don't know that I'd want to eat in due to that, but have gotten takeout numerous times.  
The first visit can be a little intimidating, but just imagine a Subway that makes pizza. You can totally control how much/little they put on and with unlimited toppings, all for 1 price (great for the artichoke lovers!).  
Glad they opened a second location because this place gets jammed sometimes!  Line moves pretty quick though :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food, amazing customer service, Eric is a great employee an knows how to treat his customers. Definitely going back soon"}
{"text":"The people working on the assembly line were really unprofessional. I get they were just having fun at work but it was a little too much. And they were super sloppy with the ingredients. I've been to this locations 4 times now since it opened plus multiple other locations and this was the first time I was really unimpressed with the service. Everyone else was good, it was just the people building the pizzas that were a little out of control."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Blaze pizza for the longest time and I'm happy to finally try it. I ordered online using their app and scheduled pick up at 11:45. As soon as I walked in, my pizzas were ready and getting boxed up. It was great! I'm very happy that process was super fast and efficient. My pizza was excellent also. I love that they have vegan cheese. Will be ordering again very soon."}
{"text":"The pizza we ordered tasted awesome but the service here isn't very great. We used the mobile app to place our order and checked-in with the cashier at 7:28. We didn't get our pizza until 8:00! You would think ordering online/mobile app, you'd get the pizza ready sooner but no. It was a good thing we didn't have any plans after otherwise we would have been late."}
{"text":"Delicious crispy crust pizza at a great price! I've been her quite a few times and have enjoyed it every time. The only downfall is that the lines can be very long sometimes (like up to a half hour in line) but it's definitely worth the wait! They give a military discount and have an app with a virtual loyalty card that earns you a free pizza once you get so many scans. The workers are all very nice friendly. Oh and both of their lemonade flavors are amazing! Definitely great for a tasty lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I've gone to this location a couple times. It's great to place anything you want on your pizza. They allow you to pack on the toppings and have a great thicker crust. They have wonderful sauces to drizzle after it's baked or to place on the side. 

This visit was better than all the times I've gone.  Two very energetic men,  Aaron and Eric, made our short visit extra ordinary.  They take a lot of pride in what they do, and made us feel like we were neighbors lol it's great to see leaders carry energy.  It is rather difficult to work in a steady restaurant.  Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Really good pizza excellent selection let you build your own the way you want it. The crust is really crispy the price is good. I have lots of stuff that are the pizza places don't once again you get to make the pizza your way"}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had at any food place. Not only did I order online then had to wait 30 minutes for my two pizzas, but the staff was completely rude and unprofessional. I've been trying to get a refund from almost 3 weeks ago from the store manager, online, and contacting customer service numerous times and I've gotten zero replies back. We will never give any blaze pizza our business ever again."}
{"text":"Really have no complaints at all. The staff is amazing, truly. I go here way too often since I work at FedEx. You are quick, pay attention to detail, and so friendly! Thanks for serving me pizza everyday :) when I find specific names I'll add them here."}
{"text":"Glad we made it for the grand opening, free pizza & Great pizza! Kids and I were happy ! Loved the BBQ chicken pizza with the added Buffalo sauce . Will be back in the future"}
{"text":"Wow !!!!!
Place is amazing!

Fast / friendly and cheap.. how can you go wrong right!!!

Build your own / throw it all on their it's the same price no matter how much you add!

To top it off three minutes it's done.

Thank you Blaze"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I like Pizza Rev a bit better because you can get a thicker crust. That's about it."}
{"text":"Go to the Decatur location. This place is skimpy on toppings. Had to ask for extra 4 times."}
{"text":"I love Blaze pizza! Pretty much only because they offer vegan cheese and the pizza is actually delicious, so kudos on that! Love the choice of ingredients. ever had fresh basil on your pizza? It's amazing!
Staff are nice and friendly, never had unpleasantness from anyone here. Since I always order vegan, they always offer to change gloves, which is very thoughtful touch. 
Ducked a star because their mozzarella cheese is everywhere! In all the containers, things that should be vegan. Essentially everything has sprinkles of mozzarella that accidentally have fallen all over the place. Have seen this at two separate occasions at this location. 
I'll be back for that vegan pizza for sure, just hope they clean up a little on the cross-contamination."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizza places I've been to in Vegas.  The service is wonderful and it's nice to watch your pizza built and cooked while you wait.  If you like your crust crispy make sure you ask for well done. My favorite is the Red Vine."}
{"text":"Doesn't get any better than a personalized pizza and a drink for about $11.  Blaze has become my go to when I am returning from Mount Charleston or if my dogs are getting groomed in the same parking lot.  I generally stick with a basic pepperoni and change up the toppings.  I've dined in and gotten it to go.  The staff is friendly and if there is a line it moves fairly quickly.  Only once have I been unhappy with a carry out pizza as it was a little undercooked to my liking but that was easily remedied by putting it in my oven for a few minutes."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Best way to get pizza in town! Great and fast service. My daughter and I really enjoyed the pizza and all the fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"We visited on a Saturday evening and pre ordered 3 pizzas online.  We checked in and waited.  And waited.  They were busy.  Two of the 3 pizzas came out and sat cooling off while the third was being prepared.  My order was the third pizza.  It was (supposed to be) the \"Green Stripe\" pizza with gluten free crust.  What I received had no green stripe (pesto sauce) and based on my swollen face the next day I doubt it was gluten free.  So, what we received were two cold pizzas and a the third was a hot dry cracker with a few pieces of chicken on it, but no green stripe.  And a swollen face in the morning.  Perfezionare!"}
{"text":"So it's PI day right?
On 3.14 right?
I'm in line right?
And there's this guy named jack right?
But this guy is so gross right?
He's handling the line right?
But he was eating on the job right?
And so he had this tomato sauce right?
And he was very rude right?

Needless to say I've had a better experience at pieology right. Good day."}
{"text":"The food is good, but I'm more concerned about the menu and employees. As I was looking at the menu, it seemed confusing because I was trying to build my own pizza but I didn't know what to pick from exactly. I also felt rushed because the girl who was writing my order down was talking really fast so she can get it out of the way and no one else was really making suggestions. The little signs are also misplaced and don't match the placement of the cheese and sauces so it was difficult to know what is what.

At least this experience taught me to be more patient and helpful with customers because I know people can get confused and need suggestions."}
{"text":"There are no complaints about this place.  I usually go to a different location and their pizza, customer service and price is excellent.  I love having healthy toppings and putting anything i want on my pizza.  Its been me and my kids choice of place to go the last 6 months anytime we want pizza because we can each get our own."}
{"text":"Their pizza is very good, very fast, and the price is right. Their ordering is terrible. The app is very very bad, does not take Apple Pay and does not make things easy to order. I'd love to order by phone but THEY DON'T TAKE PHONE ORDERS?

Update: so after you go through the crappy order process in the app, and you ask for a SPECIFIC time to pick-up your pizza, when you get there they throw it in the oven? Why did I pick a specific time? Why did it tell me I had to wait 25minutes for my pizza when I had to wait again for it to cook?"}
{"text":"Great quick pizza.  The pizza taste great and it is an easy quick pick up especially if you have the Blaze app."}
{"text":"So excited they are open, but holy moly what a line!! It was a 30 minute wait so I hope that does down a bit. Haha
The employees need to be better educated on things like the reward program & how to scan as they didn't know. The pizza however is just as delicious as always! Plenty of seating available even with how busy it was. So glad we have a Blaze close by!"}
{"text":"My experience at Blaze Pizza was nothing short of disappointing. I'm only giving this establishment 3 stars because the quality of the food was decent, or edible I should say. The staff consisted of only chatty teenagers who made multiple mistakes while assembling my pizza due to carelessness. The process of ordering my pizza took so long that I was beginning to lose my appetite. Mad annoying fam."}
{"text":"Awesome concept and fun for the whole family to goose their own toppings. Really good pizza and customer service is great."}
{"text":"Now usually I don't really care much when it comes to leaving reviews, but I just had to write this one! I've been to blaze Pizza a handful of times and I've always loved the nice and friendly service, but yesterday one girl was very rude and gave me lots of attitude. She was moving way too fast, put too much toppings on my pizza and it wasn't even close to being spread out evenly. She also rolled her eyes every time I asked for a topping! I couldn't believe how she could think that service is okay. I believe her name was carisa. I really hope this won't be a reoccurring thing!"}
{"text":"We went there Sunday 2/19/17 at 6;30pm. I asked the very friendly sauce girl for a lil extra sauce, she complied happily. Then the cheese girl was next,(SAM). SAM, flat out made a pissed off face mumbled something under her breath, got a ladle and took the extra sauce, I asked for, off my pizza, and put it back in the bowl. I asked her what she was doing, I wanted that extra sauce on my pizza. She did not reply, \"Whats the problem. I then asked?\" She got more miserable, looked up in the sky in disgust and mumbled something else. So I ignored it. I then asked her to put a lil more mozzarella  on it. It was like torture for her. I then asked for fresh mozzarella, she totally squeezed the water off the cheese, onto my pizza. I have never seen a more miserable, disgusted, and rude employee in my life. As for the other tons of employees, they were all courteous and helpful."}
{"text":"I first heard of Blaze when I wanted some pizza and checked for a new place near where I lived. I didn't really feel like waiting in a line at the time, so I didn't go. Today some people at work were saying how great the pizza was, so I decided to stop by and try it for dinner. I'm so glad I did. The young lady who helped me was very kind and informative and walked me through the ordering process. To start, the price was only $7.95 for all of the toppings you would like. Then there is a huge variety in toppings and you have complete control over how much or how little you want of each one. They have a variety of pizza dough, but I picked my favorite which is thin and crispy. I was surprised and delighted when I found it to actually be thin and crispy. It was the best dough I've ever had anywhere. The crust was slightly burnt in places but that's alright with me. I grew up eating Shakey's pizza, and it was always a little burnt, too. The pizza was very good, and I will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"Place completely ruined our evening. Showed up on time for the pizzas and they were not ready. left twenty minutes after the pizzas were supposed to be ready. Arrived home only to find out there was no \"garnishes\" on the pizzas (Pesto and Arug)

Went back and was met with confused looks when I told them they messed up our pizzas by not adding the proper toppings/garnishes.

After waiting another 10 minutes for our pies...they handed us them AGAIN with no garnishes. What the heck?! Then they proceeded to put the wrong garnish on the wrong pizza...seriously? Walked out with our $20 garbage boxes with cold cardboard and cheese...

Not even an apology from the Manager or even an offer of something to make right the hour of my life we will never get back because of their incompetent staff."}
{"text":"Im so happy there's a Blaze pizza in the northwest side of town! :-) 

My family and I love love love Blaze Pizza because it's inexpensive, tasty and the service is always excellent. The only downfall is how freaking busy this place can get! However, when we came to pick up a pizza to go, the line was pretty short (about 5-7 people). It was a Wednesday afternoon and they had just opened the place for about two weeks. 

When you first walk in, it feels like a chipotle but with pizza options. You pick your dough, sauce, cheese and toppings. As you make your way down the line, you get to build your entire pizza to your liking. Then it's baked in an pizza oven, which is why it's so freaking tasty! The dough is always perfectly cooked in a pizza oven. 

We got our usual gluten free dough with marinara sauce, sausage, mushrooms and artichoke with Parmesan cheese. But you can order whatever you want. There's 50 different meat, vegetable and sauces for you to choose from. If it fits, they'll put it on! Remember though it becomes more difficult to eat the pizza when there's too many toppings! You can sit down or take the box to go. 

I definitely recommending coming here! If you visit during dinner times, it'll be at least a 30 minute wait or longer, especially on the weekends. 

Happy dining, 

J Tran"}
{"text":"This place has been here for a while and I love pizza so we finally decided to stop by.  

Regarding the menu, it's simple and straight-forward with a few pre-selected \"favorites\" that are standards.  Of course, you can also create your own pizza with whatever you'd like.  

For this review, I just went with their standard BBQ chicken pizza.  It was perfectly cooked, and it was finished quickly.  It was Father's Day and while it wasn't too busy, there was a decent line that they were able to get through quickly.  From the time we paid, until we got our pizza it could not have been more than five minutes.  Top notch! Well done team. 

Wood-fired pizza is pretty easy and hard to mess up.  Having said that, if you have a bad temp setting or someone who doesn't know what they are doing you could easily end up with a crispy pizza that has a soupy middle.  

Happy to say that didn't happen.  Between Blaze and my other standard, Pieology, I would have to say I preferred the crust on this bad boy of a pizza.  

Overall, Pieology still rocks a better BBQ chicken, but it's a very close second here.  

Where this location probably takes over is in service. Fast, friendly and very clean.  The decor is relaxing and modern.  When you pay for your food, you should get a good experience.  If I had to pick right now, I'd pick Blaze.  

Thanks to the whole team for making my Father's Day lunch fast and yummy."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best pizza, it has a variety of different toppings you can use, and it doesnt take them very long to bake it!"}
{"text":"This was our second time eating at blaze pizza. The pizza is seriously so good, the best we've had. The crust is thin and the flavors pack such a punch that makes your mouth salivate every time you think about blaze. The staff are very friendly and the facility is clean and would be perfect for any occasion. Almost reminds me of chipotle but pizza rather than burritos. Would highly recommend to anyone who has never eaten here before to try it out!"}
{"text":"I love blaze pizza and all the unlimited choices of toppings that you can put on your pizza. If you can't choose what base sauce you want, you can ask to do half and half. Their kale, quinoa & cranberry salad is delicious as well. But if I'm coming to Blaze Pizza, I'm getting a damn pizza. Make sure to try out their lemonades/frescas! They're all delicious. The lemonades can be too sweet for me, so I normally just water it down.

Tip: Since it is thin-crusted... your crust can only hold so much, so make sure you don't load your pizza with wayyyy too many toppings! Unless you like having your toppings fall off every time you take a bite, hah."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times over the period of about 2 years. The pizza is always amazing. For just under $9 with unlimited toppings, you can't go wrong. Some people complain about the wait time. I went in today with 6 pizzas ahead of me. Mine was cooked in about 5-7 mins. Total time waiting in line, ordering, paying, then taking it out the door, MAYBE 11 mins. I've been there when they've been packed and were making the dough fresh and it was still pretty fast. Maybe 20 mins. For a custom built pizza at a super low price I'll take it. Only thing I will say is the staff is young but that's to be completely expected with most \"fast\" foods these days. All the staff was friendly and nice, one guy even after he got off work came around to ask how the drinks were and ask how everything was. Even gave me a pizza update. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Food is good!  Service is the slowest blaze in the Las Vegas valley. Go to Decatur location, order,eat and you will be done before the customers in this location have gotten their food. It isn't the customers because all are busy, it is the urgency of the staff"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for quite some time now and this is probably the last time. The service is terrible. Everyone working there is unprofessional, rude and clearly doesn't give a shit how long you've been waiting, the fact the pizza is burnt, or god forbid they have to restock a product. The kitchen is a disgusting mess to say the least and the staff is lazy. A lot of cross contamination going on especially since they offer GF pizza. It's a huge bummer because I actually enjoyed the food & how close it is. This place needs better management unfortunately."}
{"text":"This place is good, and create your own pizza?  C'mon you cannot go wrong with that.  We took our kids here this weekend and they loved having the ability to choose their pizza however they wanted.  Of course they looked at all the options and all said, cheese.  

The service is good.  The staff is friendly and helpful, and even though there was a huge line when we walked in, the line went quick.  By the time we were done paying our pizza's were coming out.  We loved the pizza's and the blood orange lemonade, forget about it.  It is fantastic.

So why three stars?  The music was so LOUD.  Maybe my kids are right, I'm getting old, but it was hard to have a conversation in there because the music was insane.  Turn down the volume on the tunes and the overall experience goes way for this yelper."}
{"text":"Quick and easy and pretty inexpensive and the pizza is what you want and build as well as pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"A coupon we received in the mail was what originally brought us to this new pizza spot in Centennial Hills, but their taste and prices will make sure we return. 

If you haven't been here before, Blaze is almost like a Subway or Port of Subs for pizza. While they have a preset menu, you can build your own pizza at more of a flat rate. That's nice in comparison to other places that tend to nickel and dime customers for each topping. The original crust is thin but fire grilled, and the pizza comes out fast. The crust has a very subtle but pleasant smoky note due to the fire. It isn't overwhelming though, so don't be afraid! 

What I liked about this spot was that they are upfront and open about nutrition. The menu shows the calories for their set menu items, and their website has a nutrition calculator for build-your-own pizzas. In addition to that each topping label also has its calories listed. You can choose how healthy or indulgent you want your pizza to be. Their selection of toppings, cheeses, and sauces is nice and expansive. Some choices were rather unique that you don't typically see, such as sautéed onions in addition to normal red onion or a spicy red sauce or a garlic pesto sauce. Since it was our first time here, we didn't experiment too much.

We went with a half-and-half pizza. My half was turkey meatball, mushrooms, sautéed onions, olives, bell peppers, and original red sauce. My husband's was more of a meat lovers with sausage, pepperoni, bacon, and mushrooms with red sauce. The turkey meatballs are actually really good. 

While the prices are fitting, I think some might consider the size of the pizza a bit small in comparison to some more commercial pizza joints. A part of this is due to their niche. They promise fast, fresh pizza from the moment it's built to the moment it hits your table. The larger the pizza, the longer it takes to bake. The pizzas are cut into six slices, but it is filling. 

I'd really recommend you try this place out. It's a new spot, but the customer service is awesome. Jesse was funny and personable while helping us with our toppings. He even did a little \"salt bae\" performance for us while sprinkling on the bacon. He was so great. They also have some unique drink selections to go with the usual Coke or Dr. Pepper, like Prickly Pear Agua Fresca. They also had a soda brand at the fountains I wasn't familiar with called Blue Sky for root beer, orange soda, and I think a cherry cola. 

If you're looking for variety and affordability, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I love Blaze!

My friends and I visited this eatery after a strenuous hike in Mt. Charleston. OMG! My pizza was delicious. 

I ordered one of their speciality pizzas, but you can make your own/ build your own pizza if you want. They also offer salads. 

The wait wasn't long at all. They have so many amazing options and with being a first timer her, I am glad that I wasn't rushed to make up my mind. 

Once I placed my delicious pizza order, it took roughly 7 minutes and my food was ready. I ordered their three meats pizza and boy, oh boy it was good. 

They have plenty of open seating both inside and out, so feel free to find a comfortable seat to enjoy your delicious food."}
{"text":"App and customer service is hit or miss.  I order and pay online and I'm always waiting long for my pizza like they just put my in after all the line is done.  I watched them do just that.  What's the point then to preorder.   I waited 25 min for my pizza. Pizza good though despite this.  All the workers have a blank stare at me like I'm weird for being mad."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I would give 5 stars if it didn't take so long. If the line is short, or may be 5-15 minutes when we come in. However on a Friday night, when it's super busy, we literally just waited an hour for our pizza!"}
{"text":"I've been to several of these make your own pizza fast food restaurants and haven't loved any of them.  This one was awesome!  The other places were over the top expensive.   As a mom with 3 kids who likes to dine out several times a week with the family (and usually a girlfriend or boyfriends in tow), I love the aspect that build your own pizza was one price no matter how many fresh toppings you selected!  We had dinner (including drinks and a salad or two) for $60.  I'm used to paying at least $100.  The place was swamped, but the service was still quick and friendly!  This will be on our list of regular dinner stops for sure."}
{"text":"Don't get discouraged by the long lines...they move very fast. The variety for me leaves nothing to be desired.   

It's not knock your socks off pizza...but it's tasty enough to come back in a regular basis."}
{"text":"I am skeptical of pizza chains, but Blaze (the Durango location, anyway) is solid pizza.

I managed to score about 8 free pizza coupons when they first opened here, and I took maximum advantage. I happily pay for a Blaze Pizza, though, I've not had a single bad experience, a single bad pizza, a single unfriendly interaction. 

If I had to nitpick about something, I'd say the ricotta could be softer and maybe slightly saltier; if you try for a white pizza or isn't quite right. My opinion, your mileage will almost certainly vary.

If I'm looking for a Sicilian style crust, I have to look elsewhere, but when a really good this crust pizza is on the agenda, Blaze rocks."}
{"text":"Love the pizza. The toppings are fresh, and there are quite a few toppings to choose from. The service is hit or miss. Tonight there are 5 people working, and 5 people in line. But only one person was actually helping customers. Not sure why?  But I often see employees just standing around. In some cases they seem to put as much effort into looking busy as they would if they just worked."}
{"text":"I have gone to this place twice now. The pizza is great and cooked fresh in front of you. The ingredients are superb. The price is pretty low compared to other pizza joints. The few reasons why im giving it 4 stars out 5 is the lack of service, and slow wait times. Other then that, you should check this place out!"}
{"text":"He staff was very friendly and helpful. The pizza is also pure quality and very delicious. DEFINITELY COMING BACK HERE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"We received a free pizza coupon in the mail.   So happy we tried Blaze.  We requested the \"high rise dough\" liking thick crust... My husband likes 
 His pizza piled high with all of the toppings and I like a few simple toppings... Blaze offered great service ...the line was long BUT moved quickly. The pizza was yummy...and the restaurant was super clean. The pizza is very inexpensive.. $ 7.95. Thin or $9.95 for Thick crust....with as many toppings as you like... Yep , no extra charge for toppings!!!  All I have to say is the other pizza joints in the area better step it up as BLAZE IS SETTING THE STANDARD HIGH! Welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We discovered this place last weekend thanks to a coupon in the mail. It's near our house and we are so glad we went in. The line was long, but moved fast enough. I don't miss me waiting for great food anyway. The pizza was delicious!  They put any toppings and sauces you want on it. The crust is crispy and perfect. The salad my husband got was about $6, but he loved it. Their lemonades and specialty sofas were good too. We've already been twice!  I love white pizza with ricotta, feta, and mozzarella and theirs is amazing!  Have a feeling we will become regulars."}
{"text":"I waited in line for an hour and a half. Everyone was pissed off...the least they could do would be to offer everyone a drink. Poor management and poor staff! Nobody had a sense of urgency, just bad attitudes!"}
{"text":"Wanted to give this place a try since it was so close to the house... but a friend of mine said \"DON'T DO IT... used there app to order and pay (so it'd be quicker)... but ended up waiting 1 hr for 3 pizzas\".  Must of been a fluke I thought.  So I downloaded the app, ordered/paid online around 4:45 (pick up time 5:30) with an awesome message that said \"your pizza's will be made but won't go into the oven until you check in with us, so make sure to check-in with us\"... so awesome, how convenient. NOPE!! Got to BLAZE around 5:25...CHECKED IN WITH CASHIER RIGHT AWAY. 15 mins went by... then 30 mins went by... (20 walk-in orders have already been filled and out the door)... so I spoke to the register (same person i checked in with) and kindly asked about how much longer (first time there, didn't know if this was the normal wait time) and she asks me if I checked in... I said yes 30 minutes ago, so she turns around and sees my pies are still chillin on their wait racks, just hanging out, raw, uncooked... 40 minutes after checking in for a quick in and out... I finally get my pizza's. I guess it wasn't a fluke... will stick with Papa Murphys and PIEology!!"}
{"text":"So I'm not to happy with blaze pizza on durango because half my pizza was really burnt the other half was kinda cooked but not and they only had 4 to go boxes and no blood orange drink and there product looked like it's been sitting there since yesterday ( pepperoni,mushrooms,cheese,spinach etc.) So I don't think I will be back to blaze on durango poor service too!"}
{"text":"Man it's really disappointing to see a business deteriorate! I went to Blaze for the last time. This place was disorganized, dirty, nothing stocked on the food line and not a manager in sight. It was as if it was being managed by angry teenagers each with disappointment each time someone walked in the door. I asked for gluten free and they were not prepared for gluten free order, no glove change and no concerns about allergies as per usual. The staff was irritated by my requests for feta cheese ( not stocked) sausage (not stocked) chicken ran out mid order and they decided to add goat cheese to my pizza \"accidentally \" and I was not offered as much as a simple sorry or replacement. I know it's a $10 pizza and really nothing spectacular should be expected at Blaze but perhaps this review can let management know things are NOT running smoothly!"}
{"text":"Never again will I visit Blaze on a Friday night, I easily waited 30 minutes until my order was taken. I counted at least 14 employees and there were only 2 people assembling pizzas. Is the place managed by a child? The assembly line was filthy. I understand it was busy but there was no effort by anyone to try and clean it up. The line was super long and there was no sense of urgency from the employees. It wasn't even organized chaos. The guy calling the pizzas was practically whispering. I usually love Blaze but tonight the pizza was not spot on."}
{"text":"Came into give place a try.  The ordering process was very confusing as it was hard to tell where to stand.  Then when we got to the counter, the person did not even know if they offered ice tea as a beverage.  We both ordered a stock pizzas off of the menu; yet the person behind the counter asked what ingredients we wanted on the pizza??  After getting our drinks, we sat at the \"cleanest\" table which was still dirty despite the fact that there were at least 10 workers behind the counter; some of which were doing nothing.  Then one of our pizzas which was supposed to have red sauce had none.  Overall food was good but with their being lots of pizza choices in the northwest, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite pizza places...I love that you can build your own pizza! And Jordan in the back always takes great care of my family with our complicated orders...it's nice to come in to have people take care of u and with a smile..."}
{"text":"Good fast service, excellent place for kids as well for adults. Delish choices of different pizza pies."}
{"text":"This particular location is always busy. That's why I usually place my order online first. But just keep in mind that they'll put your pizza together before your pick up order AND THEN you check in with the cashier and that's when they throw it in the oven. So you still have to do some waiting even if you order online. 

This place is just like Pieology. Build your own pizza. I've been here twice and each time my pizza gets slightly burned."}
{"text":"Always good Pizza.  Fast too!  Eric the Manager is great!  Always kind and very friendly. He is a hard worker as well doing everything from taking orders to wiping tables."}
{"text":"I've been seeing this pizza company pop up everywhere in Las Vegas & California, so I definitely wanted to finally check it out for myself. Service was super fast & extremely friendly. They take your name when you first start your order & it's nice because from that point on anyone you deal with refers to you by your first name, which is nice & makes the service more personalized.

I got the build your own pizza, which had several topping items to choose from & I'm a woman who loves her toppings. It's 1 set price for the build your own, which is around $8 & the toppings are unlimited! I will definitely be back to this company & specifically this location."}
{"text":"I was able to get a whole pizza for under 10 dollars and the quality was great!.
I recommend the BBQ chicken pizza if you're u are a first timer and the staff is very kind and responsive. Plenty of seating if you plan to eat inside or outside"}
{"text":"This place was great! I frequently crave pizza but I don't like the hassle of ordering and waiting especially if I'm not in a group. Pieology has the same kind of concept, but this place is 5 minutes away from my house and, I actually find it to taste better. There are a couple more options and the crust is crisp yet chewy and just all around delicious. As the name suggests, it is really fast service; there was quite a line, and I still got out in less than ten minutes which I was impressed by. Best of all, this was incredibly affordable, $6 for sauce and cheese, $7 for one topping, and $8 for unlimited toppings."}
{"text":"Pizza is good.  Place was DIRTY.  Behind counter and in dinning room.  Staff also wasted alot to the toppings.  Crazy"}
{"text":"Every single time that we have used their app, the pizzas are never done right. Dear Daughter reported it to the manager (Asia),and she was extremely rude about it. We reported it to corporate, they gave us a code for two free pizzas and the manager (Asia) gave Dear Daughter a hard time again. I called and spoke to the manager and she was equally rude to me. It was so insulting the way she spoke to me, and the tone she used. We're done with Blaze Pizza unless they get their act together, and train the manager (Asia) to treat ALL customers with respect."}
{"text":"It was O.K.  Pizza was ready extremely fast.  Pizza was very thin.  The taste of the pizza was so-so.  I would not say it was a good pizza.  The sizes of the pizza would not feed 4 persons.  They did not have a pizza size big enough for a family.  The only good thing I could say is it was ready in less than 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Save your money.  Went there to try it out. Not worth it. U can put whatever u want on the pizza, but it is like a personal sized pizza for one at $7.99. Just a few doors down is a pizza hut and for $2.00 more u get a large with any ingredients you want plus, free bread with the order. And pizza hut tastes much better & is faster. Blaze Pizza had like 8 or more people working there and pizza hut has like 3 and they get the order done faster. Plus, Blaze Pizza has a bunch of kids waiting on u (that's ok, nothing against them & they work hard) but, if u ask them something, they have to continually find & ask the manager; no one but the manager can make decisions there. My girlfriend ordered a salad & there were 6 other people ahead of here ordering special ingredients on their pizza. Her order was complete & just sitting on the counter but, she wasn't (after asking the manager) allowed to go and pay at the cashier; instead she had to wait till all of the other 6 finished ordering their pizza's and paying for them before she could pay which took like 10 to 15 minutes extra. Then, they wanted to over-charge her for the salad. It normally costs $3.95 and that is the price on the menu that u order from; but, when she tried to pay, they tried to charge her $4.95 because they said the price went up a dollar but, they forgot to change the menu prices. If u want cheap food that tasted cheap & u don't mind waiting, better hurry up & go there because I don't feel they're gonna be in business too much longer with service like that."}
{"text":"The BBQ pizza is awesome! I get it without gorgonzola and banana peppers. The s'mores cookie is delicious! Fast and cheap! I love it! Highly recommend! I will for sure come back! I took it to go and it was still so good! Glad I found a new lunch spot by my work!"}
{"text":"Vegan pizza that tastes amazing! Wasn't a huge fan of the squash on the pizza. I ordered a create your own pizza and it was really good. The dough is made fresh daily and you can tell! Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"Make your own pizza for $8 bucks and it's done in three minutes. It's also a nice crust that you don't feel guilt went you're done eating it. I can't wait to go try it again and their aguas fresca that they have. I tried the pear one it was nice a sweet and less calories that lemonade."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of blaze ever since they opened. When it comes to value and taste you can't match Blaze in the term of custom pizza. 

You can pretty much have your 'build your own pizza' for $8 and have it anyway you like. Unlimited toppings... you can't beat it. I customized by pizza to be half and half! 

This location was super clean and had friendly staff overall. It's a pretty big location so it's a great hangout spot for families and friends to hangout."}
{"text":"So I just ate at blaze. The pizza was great although the employees were very rude. I got a lot of attitude when one of the girls messed up my order and I corrected it. It was a minor mistakes and not a big deal but she made me feel like it was my fault. I will not be returning"}
{"text":"First time here and I'll definitely be back! Absolutely delicious!! You can choose as many toppings as you want for $8. I loved the thin crust personally! Thank you Shae for the excellent and friendly service! The pizza was amazing!"}
{"text":"Officially the worst run location I've been to. For the second time, they are out of ingredients. 20 mins in a line that only had a few people before us. They were not even aware of items they were out of. Checked on ingredients, said they had them and said they were out once we got them. Person in front of us was told they were out of olives, we reminded them they said they had olives so then they manifested olives. Work counter was a mess and I have written this review just while waiting in line. I love the franchise for how quick items are prepared, and how good they tend to be but this is just diappointing. Excuse given to us is that they are super busy.. nobody is here! This location is a lost cause. Everyone moves slow, looks lost and not on the same page."}
{"text":"We love Blaze Pizza. It is a family favorite. However, this location is NEVER clean. The tables, floors, and topping area are always dirty. With such a busy location, there should be a full time position just dedicated to cleaning."}
{"text":"This location is incredibly busy, as is the shopping center that occupies this restaurant. My first perspective was to give this establishment 4 stars based on the location and busyness; however, in the end, it's not absolutely their fault. Does this place have amazing pizza that prices very fairly? Yes! Do they have a rewards program that recognizes and acknowledges their patrons? Yes. Is their service fast and friendly? Yes! Does the Smith Shopping Center feel like it's Satan's armpit!? Of course! In the end, Blaze is a very clean restaurant, serving delicious food with fast and friendly customer service. Don't let Satan's armpit deter you from experiencing this place."}
{"text":"I was impressed with how friendly the staff was here. 
Good value. Great easy for everyone to get the toppings of their choice."}
{"text":"We love their pizzas!! Its awesome cos you can create your own and put whatever you like in it. A fun way to level up your pizza game."}
{"text":"Pizza is good, doesn't take long to get through a line.  Prices are good.  Can't really say anything wrong about this joint."}
{"text":"Great job every time we are there... once a week btw lol... online order is the way to go!!"}
{"text":"Shay was super nice! The line move fast and I got all the toppings I wanted  thanks team!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo good! I walked in on a whim during my lunch break and am so glad I did. The customer service is top knotch, and don't even get me started on the toppings. They have everything you could think of, and maybe even a few things you never would have though of! They recommended a create-your-own pizza so that I could get everything I wanted for the best price. I decided on their traditional red sauce, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, green peppers, roasted red peppers, and cherry tomatoes. The crust is delicious and crispy and the pizza's are served to you piping hot. The beverage selection is great, the house lemonade was the best I've had. Blaze is definitely my new go-to pizza spot :)"}
{"text":"Never mind what Michelle said a month ago. THIS PLACE WAS AWESOME!! Literally the best pizza I have ever had in my 37 years on this flat earth. (Lol) 
Matt you rock man! I'll be back tomorrow!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place,but went yesterday and ordered 3 pizzas online ,picked them up and came home and all my crusts were burnt...I guess I need to check my pizzas first..."}
{"text":"Pizzas good was excited that I got a gift card for Christmas went into use it literally took half an hour to get three pizzas I was first in line and was completely ignored by the staff before the healthy stuff did not even know what went on the pizzas from off the menu it's not fast fired"}
{"text":"The food was very good. Service and cleanliness could have been better. There was a layer of pizza topping droppings all over the floor behind the counter. Seems like there are a bunch of teenagers working there with a very short attention span."}
{"text":"Loved this place (Blaze on Durango) until recently. Always went there and ordered food for parties but when we ordered to-go on Mother's Day (thanks for the gift, Blaze) my vegetarian pizza did not have ANY mushrooms when I asked twice to add extra mushrooms. Also, they were so stingy with toppings that day that I found myself basically eating the crust (it was yum but not what I paid for). When I tried to complain they put me on a long hold and responded only on my fourth call, so I would recommend to check if you got the pizza you were ordering while you are there. Did not expect this issue to come up and would think twice before going back. Thanks for crust guys!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! The staff is always very helpful and patient with customers. Our order gets difficult sometimes and they are always friendly. Will continue to come back! And they never lose pizzas!"}
{"text":"Very good pizzas! I've only been once as they sent me a coupon to come try a pizza for free, but I will definitely be going back to try other types of pizzas. They're very quick and have a lot of toppings, cheeses, and sauces to choose from. Highly recommend and definitely better than pieology."}
{"text":"The pizza and salads are delicious. The prices are extremely reasonable! The customer service is GREAT, everyone is always so friendly, the restaurant is very clean and I love the variety of juices they offer."}
{"text":"All of the staff were extremely nice and they were patient and professional. The pizza was absolutely outstanding. I did what was called the high top and added extra arugula to it and caramelized onions. Everybody else enjoyed their pizzas just as much and I would come back here in a moment. I actually think that we will open one of these restaurants are self next week"}
{"text":"5 stars for sure!!! The staff is awesome and the pizza is amazing. I had the white top and loved it!! This will quickly become a new spot for us!"}
{"text":"Tried this spot on whim when my honey and I were craving pizza and didn't want to drive far from home. The line was quite long during the middle of the day on Friday, but seemed to moved along pretty quickly. Standing in line I downloaded their rewards app and was pleased to get a free drink on my first visit!

I like that there are several crust thicknesses and sauce choice. We both went with original crust, I had classic red and he the spicy. We dod the build your own because why not! After a multitude of toppings being added, we waited a little over 5 minutes for our pizzas to be done. They came out crispy around edges and nice and soft throughout. The first time we went we both got pesto drizzle, our second trip he got buffalo and ranch drizzle.

I enjoyed the classic red flavor but apparently the spicy just isn't that spicy. I also LOVE the blood orange lemonade and he likes the root beer. 

The place is very spacious and simple design that was appealing. The music is quite loud there and that is about my only complaint. 

Definitely a place I would regularly go to and make a different pizza every time!"}
{"text":"I had tried Pieology prior to Blaze.... so my review is based on Pieology as a point of reference. I'll start with where they are better. Toppings- Blaze has more topping choices. I don't recall seeing roasted garlic or kalamata olives as an option elsewhere. They also have really amazing side or entree salads!! Drinks- they have fun agua Frescas and lemonades!! Efficiency- it only takes a few minutes for your pizza to Cook in the oven so you're encouraged to pay and wait at the counter for it. It gives you literally enough time to pay, full your drink cup and get back to the counter to pick some final toppings. Which brings me to my next point. Pieology doesn't give you the option to finish your pizza off with drizzles of pesto, olive oil, bbq sauce or hot sauce. The arugula though..... is really the selling point for me. 
The cons? Only one. The pizza crust is not nearly as crispy as Pieology ends up being. 
Overall..... blaze will be my go to do it yourself pizza.... however, I'll enjoy a Pieology when I'm near one!"}
{"text":"Their pizzas are awesome! I always do the build your own. The crust has a great crunch and taste. It's addict so beware. The staff are always nice."}
{"text":"was very good, had a nice selection of toppings and cheeses. Blaze was a little pricey though $25 dollars for 2 personal pizzas and 2 fountain drinks. What made up for the price was there selection of refreshing drink choices like lemonade mint aqua fresca and prickly pear aqua fresca just to name a couple. Overall = will come again."}
{"text":"I like Blaze Pizza and the business model they created to have your pizza built just how I want it.

Sometimes there is a wait but not once the pizza is being fired, that only takes a couple minutes. I like how simple it is when choosing my crust and toppings.

Blaze pizza has created a fan when I want an affordable and delicious ready to eat pizza."}
{"text":"Very close to a Neapolitan Pizzeria where you get your own personal pizza. The ingredients were definitely top notch too between roasted garlic, ricotta and even arugula! I would love to see prosciutto, but hey, for the price point, it's very good. You won't go wrong stopping in. One other thing I want to bring special attention to is the fact that all of the employees had amazing manners, were professional and polite! It is very hard to find that in this world and that for me really makes it that much better! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has turned around we had several bad experiences here and stopped going for awhile last few times where good . I have been using their app and for the four times I went I have one flame even tho I have given them my phone and they said it was good I got a email from blaze saying go here four or three times and get a free pizza so I jump on it and I emailed the company to see if they would help me out and just said sorry just another reason I don't like this place sometimes"}
