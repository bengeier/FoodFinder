{"text":"The latte is one of the best I've had in the city.  The tables out front offer a great view of 17th Ave."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for a coffee and a goody.  The service was very friendly and the place wasn't packed.  The latte was delicious and the almond croissant - what can I say.... awesome!!!  Wonderfully flaky and tasty.  My hubby enjoyed the scone but some jam would have made it a bit better.  I'm thinking a larger goody case would be a great addition! :-). Will definitely be back!  A big plus is it isn't crowded with tables."}
{"text":"This is a great new addition to 17th. I think one thing you can't have too many of are coffee shops.
I popped in with a friend for an iced mocha ( delicious and not too sweet as requested) and the staff were fantastic. They looked like they actually enjoyed their jobs. 
It's a very cozy space. They offer a few pastries as well but it's mostly just drinks on menu otherwise. The prices are similar to those of P+S or Analog."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is amazing! It has a great atmosphere, the employees are friendly and the coffee is great! 
I got the chai latte with almond milk and I have to say it was the best chai I've had yet. The price was also very affordable.
I definitely plan to stop in every time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The atmosphere, location and the fact it's open late, as well as the coffee! You can't go wrong with philosafy!"}
{"text":"Good ambiance in this new coffee shop on 17th, apparently geared towards the intellectual crowd (given a bookshelf to pick reads from, and of course the name \"philosophy\" itself). 

Decent quality of coffee and pastries. I tried their latte, which was acceptable but nothing to write home about. Along with my coffee, I had the Nutella croissant which was good and fairly rich. The fact that it was warmed up enhanced the flavour.

I was not impressed however by their alternatives to milk. Whereas they serve almond and soy milk, they charge about $1.50 to have any of those choices instead of regular milk! That's about twice what any other establishment would normally charge. The excuse is that the almond and soy milk they use is of a superior quality and sourced from some exclusive brand, however for people with intolerance to lactose (such as my wife) it seems like an disproportionate price hike for a latte or cappuccino.

I am a believer in supporting local, so I will be back to Philosaphy in the future. Although it is an ok coffee shop as it is right now, there is definitely room for improvement."}
{"text":"Had a real nice start to my morning here.  Had the cappucchino and relaxed to some nice music playing.   pricing is typical for a place like this,  a nice place to stop on 17th."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere very tasty tea and great hours.
There is amazing coffee and lots of bakery treats.  
A great place just to chill and read or chat with friends."}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee crave, not just drinks, but also to chill & chat, and getting a task done. The atmosphere and the layout are suitable to my style. 

The service is top notch every visit, the drinks were all great (Try Pour Over Coffee, Matcha Latte, Iced Coffee, Latte, London Fog & Mocha Latte). I have yet to try their pastries, and having a loyalty card makes it likely to come back for more stamps."}
{"text":"There are few places that have delicious espresso.  This place is one of them!  A true coffee artist should not have to add any sweetener to their coffee.  After getting my latte it was crafted quite beautiful.  Also the staff is easy on the eyes."}
{"text":"Great service and excellent espresso. Took some beans home for my aero press and I'm loving the flavours I get. Top spot, glad they opened close to my work!"}
{"text":"Coffee was okay.  It's just coffee.  BUT my chocolate banana croissant - now THAT was something. Sooo so yummy. You should stop in, even just to try this baked delight. 
  Very cool looking little coffee shop a block east of Analog (which I like better). 
  Try the banana croissants when you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Big fan of their mocha. I would argue it is the best I have tried in a long time. I love the aesthetic of their cups and their overall branding really. Staff are friendly, particularly the owner. I think I've been back 5 times in a week and I am not ashamed about it. I would recommend more baked goods to go with their coffee because all I have seen so far are croissants or those muffins. Also it can get quite bright in the cafe during mid-day I wish they had blinds of some sort!"}
{"text":"Philosafy coffee just opened today. The new place has very friendly staff, an awesome owner, and great coffee! The owner came and greeted us and made us felt very welcome. I very much enjoyed the cool design concept; definitely a relaxing place!

Will be coming here way more often!"}
{"text":"Their cappuccino is delicious! I like the interior as well. Only a block away from Analog, and the few times I've gone I've found it's not nearly as packed. I can see myself spending some time in here to work on my writing."}
{"text":"Really good coffee place, nice decor and atmosphere. Will come here again."}
{"text":"The city's most pretentious coffee, and I mean that endearingly. A lack of pretension is a lack of ambition, which should never be lacking when speaking of taste and flavour. 

This coffee shop and what they do may not be for everyone, and there may be no justification to their prices. But what you can say is that these guys and doing what they can to bring you a different cup of coffee.

And to that point, there is no other coffee out there quite like their Sparkling Socrates. Which at its heart is simply an iced americano but the twist is that it served with a sparkling water instead of flat. An innovation which I think is wholly successful in delivering a new way to experience espresso.

Don't come here if you just want to have coffee, come here if you need a break from your daily double double."}
{"text":"I recently visited Philosáfy after reading all the great reviews!  I was not disappointed!  A great location with ample seating inside & out, a nice vibe, friendly staff, and of course . . . excellent coffee!  I loved my latté so much, I bought a bag of the Columbian Finca La Florida beans.  If the select beans were good enough for the 2015 Columbian Cup of Excellence Competition, then they were good enough for me!  The Victoria Arduino 'BlackEagle' machine they have is the same model the baristas are using in the 2016 WBC.  Outstanding!  
Overall, I was very impressed with this new addition to the 17th ave coffee scene!  The owner is great, too!  They should do very well!"}
{"text":"nice open place, very cozy, staff was nice, price was reasonable like any other coffee shop and most importantly the drinks didn't taste cheap. Their matcha is a favorite of mine. Def coming back."}
{"text":"Philosafy is a good place to drop in for a good latte (or whatever), some snacks and chat with friends. Situated on the busy corridor of 17th Ave. SW, it's definitely larger than the nearby Analog and of course a better choice for drinks than Starbucks.
The coffee beans are also very good, even though they are not my 'go-to' bean place. But even though they have limited selections, they are decent quality.
Got some work to do on an online project? Want to oggle the pedestrian traffic on a warm summer evening? Philosaphy will suit well."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop. Good selection of music and a great 12oz drip. I'm yet to buy beans from here, but I likely will. Recommend his place for catching up with a friend and enjoying some real proper coffee. Great for people watching out the window too."}
{"text":"Philosafy perfects the 17th Avenue laid-back barista groove.  Friendly, helpful and quick with the chuckles.  Slow with my Americano... but that's 'cause it needed to be just right... so this espresso perfectionist approves... and grooves... and sips and moves..."}
{"text":"The service is pleasant - Just right. 
The Mocha is smooth, elegant and balanced. 
And to top it off you can sit inside a beautifully set coffee shop. Lots of space to get work done or to catch up with friends. Or if you prefer the outdoors there is space for that as well. 

Give it a shot it might be the space you are looking for."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee in a great atmosphere.  I am loving this new addition to Calgary's coffee scene.

The first time I went, I ordered a regular coffee with an almond croissant.  It was great!  The coffee was rich and the croissant was AMAZING!!!  I was craving an almond croissant a couple days later so I went back and they didn't have any croissants.  Oh, sadness!  I settled for a mocha, which was also delicious.  Rich, sweet, but not too sweet.  

Looking forward to coming back...for an almond croissant!"}
{"text":"Coffee shop. Lots of coffee drinks, baked snacks and coffee related things you can buy. Place was filled with people, baristas make designs on top of your drink with skim milk. Latte was tasty.  It's a trendy coffee Place, could have just said that and used it as my whole review."}
{"text":"Fine Coffee, great atmosphere and amazing service, just opened today and already busy. I love to support local, philosafy is located in the heart of 17th Ave sw, I had the Americano and tried a almond crossoint. This is my new coffee hangout. Must try!"}
{"text":"This new coffee shop popped up around this summer and since then, I was dying to try it. After all, 17th ave is filled with great cafes and restaurants, so I had high hopes for the place.

Philosafy is far from a tiny neighbourhood coffee shop with barely any space to move around. On the contrary, it is spacious and large with a generous amount of seating and tastefully decorated in a hipster and modernist type of fashion.

I ordered a soy latte and an almond croissant, each of which I was very pleased with. The coffee is bold, distinct, yet still smooth and the croissant was absolutely to-die-for. 

All in all, great service and ambience. Their prices are a bit on the higher end of things, but are in line with that of Analog, Phil and Sebastian, and Rosso."}
{"text":"How did a whole coffee shop pop up in my hood, and I didn't know about it! For shame, me! For shame!

Liked it! Friendly staff, great atmosphere, nice decor, and not super busy! They make a proper, traditional cappuccino, bright espresso balanced just right with the sweetness of the milk, which was not over steamed.

Definitely worth checking out! lots of room inside, cool decor, I am excited to go back."}
{"text":"People are not kidding around, best matcha latte and almond croissants (ask them to warm it up!) I love how they serve their beverages in mason jars and their to go cups are so trendy. I love the modern decor and the rugs make the place feel like a fancy cozy living room. Great customer service and great atmosphere to do work or meet up with friends."}
{"text":"The name of this coffee shop is oddly similar to Phil and Sebastian but they are not related guys! This is a nice little coffee shop that is pleasantly decorated with wood seating and it has Kokedama plants on the side which were really adorable (on sale for $30 each). There were several people here getting some work done while others were taking in some sunlight out in the patio. 
These guys roast their own coffee in store which is awesome! I tried their chai latte while my friend had their cappuccino. Both were really yummy! I would have liked more food options but they did have some croissants available which looked good. Overall, I liked the atmosphere and the coffee here so I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"While I was skeptical of the high price point, this was the best dirty chai I have ever had, hands down. Definitely worth giving a try, coffee snob approved."}
{"text":"I got a \"traditional macchiato\" and it was very good- poured, not scooped, as is my preference. The Socrates Espresso they're getting from Coffee Concept is balanced, a little bright, and shows that this roaster has lots of potential in a market that now has some of the best roasters in the country. I will admit that I was hoping Philosafy would go with P&S, Rosso, a smaller outfit like Rave or Baya Rica, or maybe somebody we haven't seen in Calgary like Pilot or Detour, but I've seen the great beans CC is providing to Cafe Blanca and am happy to see it evolving. Those are the good points. Notes for Philosafy: first, the branded bags are beautiful-in fact all of your branding is--but you NEED ROAST DATES. Nobody is going to take a third-waver seriously in bags that don't show when the coffee was roasted; this is artisanal coffee 101 here, so get to it. Second, baked good are from Boulangerie, a choice I can't support when Sidewalk Citizen and Al Forno are so much better and better priced in my opinion- Boulangerie can't even pull off a decent almond croissant; theirs is just a plain croissant with icing and almond slivers, and as you can see by your $4 cookies, they're too expensive. I hope you work this out, but for coffee, you're more than on the right track!

Redacted June 5 2016: They got roast dates and are checking out other baked options, so 5 stars! They cold brew is amazing btw."}
{"text":"This place is primarily a coffee shop. They have some baked goods that come from Sidewalk Citizen and I don't think there is any food aside from that.

The coffee itself is a little too acidic for me. I am not a fancy coffee lover so I'm sure it's because my boorish and unrefined palette can't appreciate \"real coffee\". I've tried several of their drinks: latte, cappuccino, Americano, and their regular and all of them don't taste good to me. 

I still come here because I like the atmosphere and it's a good place to work. I would give it 4/5 except there have been more than one occasion where their internet is nonfunctional. Usually when there are issues, it's just slow, but this past weekend I was there and the internet didn't work all afternoon. The place wasn't even very full. I hope they fix their internet issues, as it stands I wouldn't recommend coming here to work."}
{"text":"Wether you're craving a regular cup o' joe or a fancy macchiato this place is for you.

The place itself is nice although nothing to write home about. The staff is friendly, the prices are acceptable and the overall experience is for sure a positive one. 

Word of advice: If you're going to bring your laptop and work on the latest draft of \"50 shades of purr\", make sure you bring a macbook, otherwise you'll recieve judgemental looks from the hipster crowd."}
{"text":"This is r coffee go to everytime v r in 17th avenue.. their almond crossiants r my husband's weekness.. love this lil warm cafe.."}
{"text":"Went in here to just sit and read while enjoying a coffee. The cafe was nice, the staff alright. I ordered a coffee, went to put a little cream in it and realized the cream had curdled. I thought, no bid deal- it can happen. Went back up to the bar and let them know and the barista acted like it was my fault. Told me it was new cream so there is no reason for it to curdle and walked away. The cashier came over and asked me what happened and I told her and she said they would make me a new one- she guesses. 
You could see the chunky curdles in the coffee! Yes, please get me a new one. I normally wouldn't complain about something like that but when you act like I purposely curdled the milk, I get a little defensive. Also, I'm not going to drink it. 
The new coffee was ok. Not great. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Coffee was good and the almond croissants were delicious! Try the iced mocha - not too bitter like most places but not overly sweet either. 

The only issue is that the seating is a bit weird. They have long tables that can be shared but only a few smaller tables so sometimes it can be hard to find a table to have a private conversation. Not a big deal though. 

A tad bit overpriced but overall really good! 

Getting there is a pain due to the construction on 17 Ave but once you're there - it's great!"}
{"text":"Working on a paper? Want to be inspired by the beauty of 17th Ave.? This coffee shop is right across the street from Western Canada High School, where I spent three glorious teenaged years of life.

The walls are decorated with good art, there are simple plants on each table and it's filled with a downtown trendy crowd. 

My tea was OK. He suggested looseleaf and that was hard to drink down to the bottom, but I appreciate the effort. I also appreciate the space. It's a nice little hang out. This is a good spot to have a conversation. I especially like the street view. 

For a Wednesday night at 6 PM this place was pretty packed. There were probably at least 10 full tables, 2 empty and people coming in and out for pick ups. I think this is a nice addition to the area. Visit and experience for yourself!"}
{"text":"Great location, ambience and delicious tea!! This coffee shop in the middle of the 17th ave has a cool vibe!! In addition the matcha tea is really good and the service is very friendly! And is never super busy as the place is not super small ..."}
{"text":"Interesting name for a coffee shop.  And even more interesting how it's spelled.  I hate to label this place, but it's definitely hipster.  I can't put my finger on it as to why....but it just totally screamed hipster when I walked into it.  I ordered a latte, and holy geez it was expensive.  I forgot to take a picture of the latte itself, but I did snap a picture of the menu because I was in shock as to how expensive my drink was.  Deep down I was telling myself, it's this expensive because it must be a good latte.  And while it wasn't bad, it wasn't good either.  In my opinion, definitely not worth the hefty price tag considering theres other coffee shops nearby that serve delicious coffee."}
{"text":"Philosafy is still new to the strip, and their selection is minimal, but I'm impressed with their quality. Their latte is smooth to drink. The iced chai is amazing, it tastes just like a traditional chai that I tried once. Will definitely come back to check out the pastries, as the selection was limited because the bakery is closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"Great coffee, very nice staff. Special shout out to Nicolas!. 
Nice ambiance, great decor, friendly atmosphere, any type of coffee you want and the staff knows how to make them!. It was hot out while I was visiting Calgary and so I had a nice iced latte. Very yummy!"}
{"text":"Combines two of my favorite things--coffee and philosophy! Glad I found it. They had a neat pour over station."}
{"text":"These guys know their coffee, whether you are coming for a latte or a pour over they have you covered. Amazing selection of coffee that us always brewed to perfection."}
