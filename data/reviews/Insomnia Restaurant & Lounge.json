{"text":"Chicken and waffles are awesome!   And that's about it folks   Don't bother with the pasta or hamburgers (was not impressed at all).    Friendly staff who seemed to disappear after giving us our food .... For a long while....."}
{"text":"Insomnia's been around forever and it's still going strong! Rec this place for lunch   Tried: Eggs Charlotte ($11.50) Insomnia's hollandaise sauce has a bit of a cheesy flavour. It adds a bright colour and if you like a bit of cheese, then you'll probably prefer Insomnia's hollandaise over some other breakfast joints. The eggs were well poached - not as perfectly as Hoof Cafe's but still nice and runny and the side of greens was good to nosh on between bites.  Eggs Manami ($10) Ordered off of their \"Brunch Features\" menu, the Eggs Manami had wonderful curried rice patties. This is a delicious alternative to English muffins, and I recommend this over their regular Eggs Benny.!  Home Fries Their home fries are great! The potatoes are freshly tossed in a bbq-y sauce, and they're not at all soggy. These were quickly snarfed and definitely worth adding to your order if they don't come with it anyways.  French Toast Heaven on Earth ($10.50) Yummy - It was crispy and filling with a generous amount of fruit. The cream cheese was good, but I would've enjoyed it just as much without. I'm not so sure that the strawberries were wild as advertised, but they were fresh! This was great drenched in maple syrup.  Baked Pancakes ($10) So these aren't so much pancakes as cakes-baked-in-a-pan. They are huge and are made to order and from scratch. They are very thick and dense, and take at least 20 minutes upon ordering to arrive. We were definitely stuffed after polishing these off!   Chocolate Banana Pancakes & Apple Cinnamon Pancakes While good, I don't think I'd order it for myself but as a post-breakfast treat to share with a larger group.  Overall, Insomnia is a bright cheery breakfast joint in the Annex. I recommend it if you're looking for a tasty brunch at a great value. Their pleasant service, bright dining and bar areas, and great brunch options make it a great choice. Definitely a step up from other local breakfast joints that I've tried with respect to service, atmosphere and quality of food. Get the home fries and their egg dishes are quite tasty.  I've also been there for dinner. If you go, you *must* try their Climax Cake. It's as good as the name suggests ;). Flourless chocolate torte, wonderfully dense and rich - I would return just for that dessert alone! Their pizzas are also quite good and named after Toronto neighbourhoods - I tried their Annex pizza. Their Mediterranean Platter and fries with aioli are decent appetizers to share with the table - but the pizza would be better.  Erin http://cookiesandtomatoes.blogspot.com/"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and I have to say they never disappoint!  I went with a friend to grab brunch and ordered two eggs benedicts, the pulled pork and salmon benedict (definitely the bang for your buck).  The food came quickly as it wasn't that busy during a Wednesday brunch hour. Our waiter was pleasent as they checked our table to ask about our food and took away our plates promptly.  The pulled porked benedict was phenomenal as always. The sauce on top of the pulled pork was addictive and made me want to ask the chef for the recipe. The eggs were cooked perfectly;  runny in the middle and cooked enough to hold its shape. The homemade fries coated in the homemade ketchup sauce which was perfect; tangy, sweet and comforting. The salad and the piece of fruit were a nice ending to such a delicious meal. My friend and I were stuffed by the end of it.  Overall, this place is one of the best places I've been to for brunch! The stunning, comforting food and excellent service will keep me coming back for future brunch excursions."}
{"text":"This place is good but not great. The food is nice and the atmosphere is fine. Both times I've been here we got seats quickly. I'll definitely be back here sometime in the future but it won't be my first choice - Insomnia is a good back-up plan."}
{"text":"Been here twice in 2 weeks. First time was for Winterlicious and the chicken and waffles were awesome. My friend had the burger and said it was really good too.  Second time I just ate tacos. Tried a fish, pork, and chicken taco. Although all great I really liked the pork one the best.  Good comfy atmosphere. Good service. Good quality drinks. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  We had our meal delivered to our hotel room. While delivery was fairly speedy from Hurrier, when we opened our meal we were sadly disappointed. We paid over $100 for 3 entrees and 3 deserts. The pasta was bland and lacking any sauce and the portions were small. There was no cutlery or napkins In the bag. The pink velvet cake was the smallest piece of cake I've ever received in a restaurant and it was basically carrot cake with pink icing. The caramel cheese cake was stale on the edges. Would never order from Insomnia again!"}
{"text":"I came here with my husband on a Groupon voucher this past weekend. We had such a great time!! This place makes a perfect location for a date night out. The Groupon deal was an exceptional value and we really got to try a variety of food on their menu, from the Mediterranean plate, to their steaks and salmon that we had, the cheesecake and sponge cake for desserts, and their amazing cocktails!! And they were all so very tasty, especially the Mediterranean plate! The ambiance and wooden decor were very cool! Staff were friendly and accommodating; we had no problem getting a bigger table when some of our friends decided to join us for drinks afterwards. Overall, it was an amazing experience, the groupon was a great idea to get people like me to travel to downtown to try something new! It was our first time to insomnia and it sure won't be our last :D"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was fantastic. Great ambiance, delicious food and outstanding service. My friend and I had brunch. The huevos rancheros and home fries were fantastic. I was just in town for a few days, but this the first place I will come when I am back!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place - it's reasonably priced, good food & close to my house. I am not going back anymore however because I just can't stand the service.  I went for dinner with a group last night for dinner and drinks and the service was very slow.  We had a reso & our table was not ready when we got there.  Our server was nice enough, but a lot of people in my party sat with empty glasses for a long time.  After dinner we stayed for another round of drinks   & our server did not clear our plates from dinner.  So we had dirty dishes on our table for two hours after we finished eating.  This isn't the first time I've had slow, disappointing service there, so enough."}
{"text":"I went with friends for brunch on Tuesday. I ordered the omelette, which came with a side of potatoes, toast and salad. Everything was so tasty, especially the potatoes which were smothered in a house sauce. On top of that, mimosas were 5$, which was an added bonus. The staff was incredible, too. I highly recommend this place and will be going back soon."}
{"text":"This is a local gastro pub that offers amazing food, freshly cooked with daily changing specials.  The portions are generous and the prices competitive.  The staff are very friendly with no \"Toronto attitude\".     There offer fresh seafood, vegan friendly dishes (lentil Sheppard pie) and the brunch is one of the best in the city.  Eaten here several times and it is consistently excellent."}
{"text":"Hey there, everybody -- Foodie T. here!  Heads up! This review is about the burger. After lurking this menu item online for months, I finally decided to just take the plunge and try it out. And I'll tell you what, I was not disappointed. This burg is thick, juicy, and the patty is cooked to perfection. The bun was also rather delicious. All in all, it was a pretty delicious burger for under 10 buxx. Nothing else in the Annex will come close in that respect  !!! PRO-TIP !!!  Don't go for weekend brunch unless you like waiting in lines LIKE A PEASANT!   !!! PRO-TIP No.2 !!!  Head over to Popeyes and get a big box of fries for 5buxxx. They're pretty delicious.   I'm out."}
{"text":"the wait to get seated was not that long for a party of 4 on a weekend. The price for food was incredibly reasonable for the quality and the portion of the food. the drinks were amazing too! I love this place and will definitely recommend to friends and go back again"}
{"text":"My cousin and I randomly passed by this place on Sunday. I must say, I really did enjoy their brunch menu esp because its more known for a bar. They serve genetic brunch food but the food quality was pretty good.  I ordered their pea-meal bacon with hollandaise sauce, extra sausage on the side and my cousin had their smoked salmon. We both really enjoyed our meal. I definitely would recommend this place but be prepared to wait a bit."}
{"text":"I like to go to this bar to catch up with friends that I haven't seen in a while. The ambience is really great, the food and drinks are good and reasonably-priced. The only think I would tighten up a bit is the service, sometimes it takes a while to get anyone's attention when you're ready for a re-fill. Otherwise, a great place!"}
{"text":"Second time eating here following Winterlicious. The food is just as great. I went for dinner and had the famous chicken and waffles. Amazing. Bobby our server was super nice and helpful. Great atmosphere. You have to eat here."}
{"text":"MY FAV SPOT! I've been coming here for years! Those breakfast homefries are out of this world. What makes this the greatest spot is that there isn't a time not to go. You can enjoy brunch with your pals or enjoy drinks and pizza in the evening. The servers are so sweet and helpful. The menu is amazing, everything about this place is great. If I could give more than 5 stars I would. Make sure you get the sofas at the back! So comfy., also try their brunch mimosas"}
{"text":"After seeing all the fantastic reviews I was thoroughly disappointed. Both me and my fiancé ordered 2 eggs, bacon, home fries and toast. Something that is not complicated, which makes it more disappointing.   The negatives: My fiancé toast came cold. My HOT chocolate came cold. The pink velvet cake was dry, really dry. For the price of brunch, it was definitely not worth the price especially since I could have made all this by myself and it would have turned out better.   The positive: When my boyfriend told them the toast was cold they immediately changed it super politely.   Overall, I was disappointed with everything and my fiancé said he would never come back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for an early dinner with a friend. We had a pleasant chat and loved the cocktail selection!   The waitresses recommendations from the menu were helpful and the promise that the sharing nachos plate was huge fulfilled the description! We followed this with pizza but we're unable to finish, too full!  It was nice to sit near the window for the extra light coming in and to just chit chat and admire the surroundings including the unusual artworks for sale on the walls."}
{"text":"This was my second visit taking my best friend for her first time. My daughter joined us as she \"happened to be in the area\".  Disclaimer, I returned for the chicken and waffles and they were as good as the first time. Plentiful crispy chicken sandwich attacked on waffles with syrup and coleslaw. It fulfils all the major food groups as far as I'm concerned. The chicken is tender and is seasoned well and just spicy enough for me.  My friend had the chicken avocado sandwich and a side order of sweet potato fries and enjoyed both.  My daughter had had the chicken linguine in an Alfredo sauce. It was a large plate with nice bite sized pieces of chicken.   We all drank beer which was very reasonably priced. Great service from our waitress and many thanks to Julian.  My only wish is that more of the dishes have a side included. Some did and overall the portions are great at Insomnia. The \"sharing menu\" is my new pet peeve with many newer restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Yum! If you don't know by now Insomnia is one of the busiest and tastiest spots in the Bloor/Bathurst Area. It is a top competitor with its brunch menu and laid back dinner menu.   Mind you, the drinks are a little pricey but something's gotta give. The staff, decor and vibe are all A+ here.  The biggest drawback are the wait times - be prepared to waste some time at Honest Ed's or in the crammed doorway while you wait for what seems like forever for a table.  Whether it's a date for two or a group outing if your patient Insomnia is worth it."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a great atmosphere. The servers were quite friendly. But the food was just average for me. Wasn't bad, but there wasn't anything that stood out for me."}
{"text":"So.... We came back,our second visit to insomnia.  I have to say that all 6 of us had great dinner and great time!!  The place was busy and Lit!!! Lots of good options on the menu and all reasonably priced. Sue served us for the second time and she was amazing!!  Cheers."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks. Hopefully they can step up their game food wise! The toronto sour is a must try!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Came in for brunch last week and I was blown away. I ordered the Heaven On Earth and the name does not lie. Highly recommend, and will definitely return for more."}
{"text":"One of the best waffles I've ever had! So delicious, and well priced. It was fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside, just the way it should be. My best friend had the eggs benedict and loved them.  The waitstaff is nice and attentive, and the atmosphere is really nice!   Definitely worth a visit if you're in the mood for a good brunch."}
{"text":"I've been to Insomnia a number of times, mostly for brunch, and have to say that they have some of the best brunch food I've had.  I would definitely recommend it, their Iced tea and eggs benny are to die for! A must try in Toronto"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here last weekend for brunch. There was about a 30 min wait, but not too bad. I wasn't a fan of the seating arrangement towards the back of the restaurant where we were seated though-low tables and chairs almost cafe style, which made it hard to get comfy and eat at the table. Forget about crossing your legs. Tables were positioned close together too. I could overhear our neighbors complaining about the seating arrangement as well. Besides that, service was good and the food was delicious. I ordered one of the omelettes and my boyfriend had the pulled pork eggs benedict. Loved the home fries! I thought that the $5 drink specials were tasty as well. Nice vibe there and interesting art/decor. If we're in the area again, we'll return again but will definitely request to be seated at the tables towards the front of the restaurant or bar."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere and the server was very nice. The music wasnt too noisy."}
{"text":"I'm new to the fried chicken and waffle scene and so far Insomnia is my favourite of the 3 restaurants I've been to. The fried chicken and waffles are great - the dish is prepared well with the just the right chicken-to-waffle ratio.  The only downside is the wait when you're a walk-in. It can take 45 mins to an hour to be seated. Most times I end up finding another restaurant in the area during that time."}
{"text":"I agree with what David R. had to say in regards to Insomnia having gone a wee bit downhill over the past few years.  I came here for my 30th birthday a year and a half ago & had a tremendous time. So my husband and I decided to celebrate his birthday at Insomnia this past weekend. We were seated at tables instead of at the couches like last time, which was fine. Our server was Jenny and she was very kind, sweet and helpful, so no complaints there!   The food ranged from really delicious to a bit overcooked, unlike last time when everyone was raving about their meals. I ordered \"The Little Italy Pizza\". There wasn't much prosciutto on it and it was a bit on the dry side. My husband ordered the Insomnia Burger and said it was just \"okay\". Others at our table ordered the Epic nachos and they were quite epic!   The martini menu has shrunk down to a tiny list which was disappointing. I really enjoyed all of the options the last time I went there. Drinks overall were a bit too overpriced for what we got. Watered down rye and gingers and my martinis tasted more like kool aid than an alcoholic beverage.   The music at the end of the night became progressively worse. Insomnia's website states that on Saturdays they spin deep house. Instead the DJ, if one could call her that, at the end of the night seemed to be playing her favourite playlist from her computer. She was out of the booth most of the night dancing in the corner with her friends who all seemed as though they had just turned 19. Kind of kills the vibe for a restaurant/lounge."}
{"text":"As a foodie I promote trying new places more than once as I'd like every meal (especially on weekends) to be a new experience. This place has me wanting to try the rest of the menu. 5 stars based on food, service (efficiency), and atmosphere. Great brunch place.   Masa was our server and the service (and definitely food) is a large reason why we will come back. She's polite, efficient, and knows how to read a customer's body language to either help or give more time. Definitely someone you want helping you in any setting. Don't be discouraged by the long line - they're open to you waiting by the bar for a drink and seating you quickly. We had 12+ people in front of us and within 10 mins we were seated even before our drink was brought to us.   The oven baked banana chocolate pancakes are very filling for one, and very worth it. The bacon strip Benedict and its yolk was perfectly done - a large pocket of yellow goodness ready to burst. My fiancé said \"you don't think the Benedict will be that filling but it is\". We are definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu. Thanks for the great experience."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is warm. Good value for money (lots of food) but quality of the ingredients is avarage."}
{"text":"Some friends and I visited Insomnia last night for drinks after work, and what a night to remember! We were greeted right away and brought to our seats. The atmosphere was pretty cool-casual yet sophisticated.  We started off with the three cheese nachos to share, which were beautiful and abundant; the guacamole was on fleek and the starter was really filling. As our main meals, we ordered the fish taco, chicken taco, and classic burger, which we all would describe as, \"so good.\" Everything was prepared and cleaned pretty quickly.   The drinks menu is pages long and drinks are reasonably priced. We had many double gin & tonics, but recommend the Purple Haze martini if you're feeling flirty.  And then there was Celine.  Sweet, sweet Celine.  Celine was a dream.   Celine, our server for the night, was incredibly friendly and managed her section well. She was quick to check on our drinks and provided fun conversation throughout the night. We would all like to be friends with Celine.   The only negative thing about our experience was that a girl laughed too loud throughout the night. She sounded like Janice from Friends. But that didn't even PHASE Celine! The staff were all very patient and attentive.   We rate our experience 5 Celine's out of 5!"}
{"text":"I came here specifically to try out the french toast (called Heaven On Earth on the menu) after getting excited about it from Yelp but I am sad to say that I am sorely disappointed. The French toast lacks flavor (read: bland) and the texture of the toast is tough and rubbery instead of soft and pillowy. Avoid the French toast!"}
{"text":"This place was a good experience for me. I'm used to the world of Cora's and Perkins, so this was a pleasant surprise. We went there through a recommendation of word-of-mouth. There was a line-up but after giving our names (for 2 people), instead of the original 20 mins. estimated, they managed to seat us in 10mins. The waitresses were pleasant and attentive. The food was super fantastic. I had some concoction of goat cheese, caramelized onions, egg, honey mustard and spinach I think (just look at the picture). The house potatoes were sweet and curryish, so I liked that.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in the customer service. We were visiting Toronto for the weekend and had reservations for insomnia. Reviews looked great, however we had to leave earlier to go home and changed our travel plans. They charged us 50 dollars for canceling a reservation of 7. No flexibility or understanding, rude over the phone, and overall disappointing because it was the only poor experience we had while visiting here."}
{"text":"Walked in about 10:45 am. The place was full, but my friend and I managed to get a table. We ordered our food first before getting our drinks, because we had to wait until 11 am for any drinks with alcohol in them. My friend had a latte with a shot of baileys while I opted for a Cesar. Ok, so that was the BEST cesar that I've ever had! I literally wanted to drink the whole thing in one gulp. The rim had a celery salt, chile flavor going on, a garnish of lemon and 3 olives. It was refreshing and balanced.  My friend ordered their classic breakfast with eggs, toast, potatoes and andouille sausage, while I had the huevos rancheros, subbed egg whites, which also came with black beans, atop a tortilla, side of guac and I asked for additional hot sauce. I was happy that I was also given a side of their amazing potatoes AND a side salad! Yum! For 13 bucks, a trendy atmosphere, and friendly service, I would say that the price was well worth it! Also, we beat the major rush, in which there was a line out the door. The chilly air from the guests leaving the front door open while they waited was not cool, but that was not the restaurants fault. Rather, it was the guests fault for being so inconsiderate to those of us eating. So no stars taken away for that. I really enjoyed this place and will be back! I would like to see if their dinner is as good as their brunch/lunch."}
{"text":"I've been to Insomnia many times over the years, and have usually gotten good service. My most recent visit there may have been my last.   I arrived with two friends at 8:30 and was told there would be a 15 minute wait for a table. No problem, we sat at the bar and ordered drinks. For the next hour, we watched people arrive and get seated while we continued to wait. The host said it would be \"just a few more minutes\" and then sat another table. My friend approached him and reminded him that he had said 15 minutes and we had been waiting for an hour. He seemed completely unconcerned and brushed her off by saying \"We're busy.\"   Had we been offered a free round of drinks, or an appetizer, or even a basket of bread while we waited at the bar, we would have stayed. As it was, we were hungry to the point of feeling ill, so we left and went to another cafe a couple of blocks away where we got excellent service.   The drinks and food at Insomnia are good, but I can get as good or better at places that don't leave me hanging for an hour with no explanation or apology."}
{"text":"Wanted a nice, well-priced place to grab some drinks with friends. Insomnia fit the bill beautifully. We had some nice cocktails and enjoyed the relaxed ambiance. Ill come back soon to try out the food with hubby."}
{"text":"Talk about irony. The bland food and boring atmosphere will surely lull you to sleep."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for a quick bite while we were waiting for a table at Snakes and Lattes, and it was so yummy! The mac n cheese was fantastic, and my boyfriend got the grilled cheese and tomato soup and was really pleased. Our drinks did take a little longer, but we were there on a Sunday night and it seemed like the waitress was trying to handle 7+ tables. She was super sweet and brought us our check and to-go boxes with the food so that we could make a quick escape!   All in all, it was great food and fairly fast service, and I'll definitely be going there this weekend for brunch!"}
{"text":"Insomnia has carved out a cozy spot with a loyal cliental in the very competitive Bloor and Bathurst area. I have been three times; for brunch with four, late night with a group nine, and dinner for two.  When going for brunch you can expect two things. First: a rather long wait in line, a half-hour to forty-five minutes for a couple and up words of an hour for any group. Second: an absolutely incredible brunch. The former being well worth the latter. If you are a fan of eggs benedict you will be thoroughly impressed. They have a good variety of options but the execution of both the eggs and the home fries (please get the home fries!) is what is note worthy. If you are not a fan of the \"benny\" give Insomnia one last chance to change your mind before you write it off for good.  Late night is not as busy as brunch but it has as much potential. The kitchen runs full steam until 2am every night. Drinks and food are reasonably priced for the quality. I split the fried chicken sandwich and the nachos. Average choices but above average taste.  Dinner was actually the more under whelming visit. Not that it was bad but rather middle of the road. The menu offers pastas, fresh oven pizzas and sandwiches but all can be found at many other restaurants with the same level of quality and price range.  Brunch and late night alone could put this establishment at a five star but the three star for dinner puts it at a solid four.  *Please do not mix Insomnia up with Amnesia. While they are both one word mental disorders and are located directly across the street from each other you will find very different experiences at each."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Insomnia for a while now. Lately its become a Friday after work habit. I like not being bombarded with TV's flashing commercials every 5 minutes. The music is underscored but appropriate for the time of day.  Tonight when I arrived I was offered to sample the new offers on tap. Which was nice because my fall back Ale was no longer available. However, I have found a new one that is just as nice.  I followed this up with an order of steak and frites. I opted for the fresh ground pepper brought to me with my meal, and am glad I did... I have had great steaks in my life, and I have had some majestic fries. But the flavour combination they serve here along with the horseradish aioli was just AMAZING. I couldn't have been more satisfied with my order. In fact, pretty much everything I have ordered here has exceeded my expectations.   In closing, I frequently recommend this place to friends. It has a classy, laid back atmosphere that I like, really friendly and polite staff, and great food.  I hope this helps anyone to decide to frequent this establishment.  :GW"}
{"text":"I like coming here for brunch whenever I am in Toronto.  What I usually get is the traditional breakfast and sub the bacon for sausage...It also comes with the best potatoes ever--I always try to take my friends here so they can experience how great they are! I love the vibe and the service is always great, even on the weekends, when the lines are sometimes out the door. I must add that the last time I came to Insomnia, I brought a voucher and had the same great service.  I've only come here once during the night time and was surprised how busy it was.  Seems like it would make a great date night place as well."}
{"text":"guys, if you're charging over $12 for eggs benedict, I expect you to use real hollandaise. this place charged $15 or so but didn't have real hollandaise. it was either processed hollandaise from a mix/tube, or something with a mayonnaise base instead of butter. it definitely wasn't the  simple butter/egg yolk/lemon juice formula that defines hollandaise. I wouldn't mind yucky hollandaise if it was a cheap breakfast chain, but there are SO MANY other places at this price point that have real hollandaise? the rest of the meal was mediocre, too. I feel like it's just taking advantage of students with low standards for food. I would warn any 30-year-olds away from here. it's not good. it's just student-good."}
{"text":"Insomnia Restaurant & Lounge located in the heart of Annex is a cafe by day, and trendy restaurant by night.  It consistently delivers great food, music, friendly service and has a wide variety of martini and cocktails, making it the perfect spot for, well, just about any occasion! The restaurant has a relaxing and inviting ambiance with dim lighting and upbeat background music.  Live DJs are also featured nightly at 10pm, which provides some pleasant, although not overpowering, entertainment. There is a fair amount of seating considering similar venues in the are and some lounge seating in the back of the restaurant which is really cozy.  The menu is a mixture of Mediterranean, French and International flavours. The wide variety of over 50 martinis is perfect for Martini Madness, which happens every Thursday night ($5 Martinis and $6.50 Premium Martinis). Not a martini type of person? The restaurant also offers $4 Steam Whistle pints! And If you can't make it on Thursdays, Insomnia offers daily events and specials catering to everyone's needs each night of the week. On Fridays, they have $3 Jameson Shots and $3 Candy Apple Shots, and the $11 pizzas are always a hit on Sundays.  We've been to Insomnia more than a few times, and their tasty Rosedale pizza-pesto, portabello, sundried tomatoes, red onion, chevre & olive oil-is amazing, but Thursdays are by far the best day to go.  The  late night snack menu also makes for a perfect romantic date, or a catch-up with the girls. One of our favourite items on the late night snack menu is the Calamari Po' Boy sandwich: two small sandwiches with crispy calamari, fresh lettuce and spicy aioli, super yummy for only $5!  Insomnia is open late 7 days a week from 10am to 2am, making it the perfect spot for breakfast, lunch, dinner and post work entertainment in the Annex. If you haven't been yet you are missing out on one of Toronto's best!"}
{"text":"Good food - I went with girlfriends and it was good value and tasted good. Service can be a little slow and the seating wasn't the most appropriate (we were in the lounge section) and it gets really packed, taking out 1-2 tables would make it more spacious but overall it's a good, reliable bar/eatery."}
{"text":"i don't know if I'd go to Insomnia for just a regular night out, but it sure is a rad spot to go for a drink before a show at Lee's Palace. They have a lot of martini specials and the staff are very friendly.  It's also a really good spot for a decent weekend brunch. They have overstuffed chairs and everything, so you can really get amongst the weekend sloth of it."}
{"text":"This visit was actually my second attempt here. The first time, we made the mistake of coming here right at noon with a group of 6 people. Of course, we were in for a long wait, so we ended up elsewhere.  On this visit, we came at 11am, with a group of four and were seated immediately in the back. We were seated in a cozy corner on couches, where we ate off of a coffee table.  For my meal, I ordered the Eggs Isabelle - Two poached eggs with house made hollandaise, fresh tomatoes and avocado spread, served with homefries and baby greens ($10). I typically go for an eggs benny when going out for brunch and this visit was no different. Unfortunately, I regretted this order after taking my first bite. The hollandaise was extremely bland so the whole dish was lacking flavour. I wouldn't recommend this dish. However, the homefries were amazing! Hands-down, some of the best homefries I've ever had. It was smothered in a special saue, without them being soggy. Delish!  My boyfriend went with The Traditional - 2 eggs any style, peameal bacon or sausage, served with homefries, baby greens and toast ($10). It came with two pieces of thick toast and the entire dish was nothing special. It was just a standard breakfast. But again, the homefries were to die for!  My friend ordered the Heaven on Earth - Wild berries, cream cheese and honey sandwiched between lightly tanned french toast, dusted with powdered sugar, served with a side of pure Canadian maple syrup ($10.50). I had a couple bites of this and I really enjoyed it.  We also ordered the Chocolate Banana Pancakes - Fluffy pancakes with chocolate chunks and bananas served with a side of pure canadian maple syrup ($10) to share. Since our server asked us if we wanted the pancakes for dessert, we expected them to come after our meals. However, after waiting a long time for our food, we realized they were probably waiting for the pancakes. Sure enough, everything we had ordered came at once. We dove into the pancakes immediately since we wanted to try them while they were still hot. These pancakes were definitely not the light, fluffy kind. They were dense and tasted more like a cake. Overall the pancake was just decent for me. I think I would've preferred the apple cinnamon.  Overall, I was a little disappointed. I loved the homefries, but for the most part, I wasn't too impressed with the dishes, although I do feel they do their sweet dishes better than their savoury dishes.  If only all brunch restaurants did their homefries this well..."}
{"text":"The brunch was so good I went two days in a row. The pear grilled cheese is probably the best grilled cheese I've ever had. The home fries with their signature sauce were awesome. Plus, brunch every day till 3:00 pm? Can't beat that."}
{"text":"Insomnia is one of the places that I hesitate to review because I fear it getting too crowded.  This is one of the first places we went for brunch in Toronto and years later it remains one of our favorite.  We've brought friends and family here but also love to go on our own and sit in the couches in the back.    While the place is not that large the service for groups is great and they are super welcoming to small children.    I always order the eggs manami (benedict on a gluten-free rice patty) and their saucy potatoes are my favorite in the city.  The pancakes and french toast are also highly praised-- though not my style since I'm more into savory meals.  I've also had a few martinis here followed by an aged canadian cheddar sandwich, which were just as good as I expected based on my brunch experiences."}
{"text":"Came in one weekday morning for Brunch, after searching for a place that would gve me eggs, bacon and a Caesar to help get rid of a hang over. Thankfully I staggered in just after 11 am and was able to get booze (stupid laws).  Speaking to the pleasant waitress with my head in my hands and eyes squeezed shut, i quickly asked for 3 runny eggs with pea-meal bacon and an extra strong Caesar with a whack load of Tabasco. Then I waited, fighting every impulse to lie down on the cool floor, wondering what the pretty chick on the next table would think.   Mercifully, food came before I started to slide out of my chair. One sip of that Caesar and.....WOW! i was back baby!  With my taste buds now primed, I dove into the eggs and bacon, most likely splattering the pretty chick with egg yolk in the process, but I didn't care.   Considering I ordered the safest things on the menu and considering they did not mess it up, I will give them 3 stars, with one extra star for a great Caesar.   Maybe i'll come back one day for a more civilized meal"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch a while back. It was really busy but there were only two of us so we got in really quickly.  Our server was very nice and the food was really good from what I remember.  If you're looking for a brunch spot in the annex I'd definatly recommend it."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place! I had some great times here and the food is always great. Absolutely love their breakfast menu. The service is not absolutely amazing, but I don't think I've ever had bad service here. The waiters are always nice and respectful.  The only thing I didn't like is that they don't take debit. I don't often carry cash and hate using their bank machine. Actually, I just hate using any shoddy machine in the basement of a pub or restaurant."}
{"text":"Pleasant atmosphere and plenty of space between tables makes this for a nice first date. I am a bit confused by the \"lounge\" as the chairs there afforded little lounging. I'd consider a lounge something where the seating involves something with leather seats against the wall, dim blue lighting and chill music. None of this I observed, but possibly this was because I was preoccupied with my dining companion.  I take the under-abundance of the serving as an indication of having had a premier dining experience, although it was nothing I couldn't cook myself at home.   I had the salmon which came in the form of a 200g slice on about 1/2 a potato-worth of cubed fries and snow peas and tomatoes on the side. Needless to say I had to have some drinks to help increase the caloric value of the meal, so it balanced out well.   Overall, not too bad, I wish the manly drink selection was more plentiful and better priced. I am also confused by these house drink names. The drinks are around $10+, which seems high for an establishment of this sort, but the overall bill was reasonable.   Despite any sarcasm of this post, I like this establishment, I recommend you check it out!"}
{"text":"It is kind of place I love.  I been going there since my teens and it is one of my all time favorite places.  From brunch to drinks at evenings. The food portions are great besides tasting really good. Love the chicken pasta there, so good and always left over for lunch.  The atmosphere is perfect for chatting, eating, chillin. They have really great sitting especially at the back. Big comfy chairs.  They are constantly good, I have never been disappointed once and I been going here over 15 years. This is both service and food. And for me a dependable restaurant is the best."}
{"text":"The brunch on the weekends here is amazing. Came here on a Sunday morning and waited 30 minutes to get a table. I can't stop thinking about their potatoes with the bbq sauce."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for brunch Ordered eggs Benedict on waffles Some bacon was burnt which they kindly replaced for me but half of the bacon edges were still burnt and hard to chew that I had to spit it out The eggs were more on the well done side which for eggs Benny should be runny My waffle on the top side looked great but underneath was burnt and I only figured this out halfway through the meal since I kept thinking it was the bacon 1 star for the breakfast potatoes which were good and one star for the mimosa which was yummy I came here a year ago and the food was great...maybe chef had heat too high??"}
{"text":"My favourite brunch spot. I've been going here for years. I love their French toast and home fries, and occasionally order their eggs benny combos and they're great too. Portion sizes are nice and big as well.   I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel like their dinner menu has gone downhill in the last few years: the food is overall good, but not good enough to justify some of the prices. I ordered a pretty mediocre pasta with over cooked noodles which cost way too much.  But overall I would recommend this place. Good food, great service, nice atmosphere. Definitely drop by for brunch!"}
{"text":"Its hard to find good brunch places in Toronto and i havent been impressed with my search until now. 'Insomnia' - my search is over!! You guys rock. The food is really amazing, ambience & decor is classy and contemporary, coffee is really delicious, mimosas are such a nice addition too. All in all, one of our favs in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I would recommend this place to anyone! Brunch is my favourite. I always go for the eggs Benny. The home fries are just unbelievable! There is not a better brunch in toronto!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Insomnia Cafe since 2004! When I first starting to come here, I only come at night...usually for cocktails and cakes with a few girl friends. I love their chocolate cake!  It's a very rich and dense chocolate cake. If you are craving for chocolate, this will be heaven! But I recommend sharing.   Around 2007/2008, a friend who lives in the neighbourhood introduced me to their brunch, since then, this has became my favourite brunch place in Toronto.   There are nothing that I don't like on their menu.  Coffee - free re-fill (standard) and tastes really good!  all breakfasts come with fresh mixed green and home fries. Their mixed green is always fresh! You will not find a piece that's yellow-ish , and I've been there more than 10 times!  Their home fries are also my favourite. They fried the potatoes, and baked with their homemade bbq sauce before serving. If you don't feel like benedicts, you can try \"The Traditional\" with the sausage. They serve hot dog stand type of sausages. It's really good!  They also have a gluten free menu and I had it once, it's an awesome alternative too!  On the sweet side, I will choose their citrus french toast with maple syrup.   One thing I really don't like is that they don't take reservation from 10am -2pm, so it's really hard to come with a big group of people during peak time."}
{"text":"The music is too loud and those couches are hell -- don't sit at the back, ever -- but god the food is delicious, the service amazing, and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch!! The restaurant has a chill/casual ambience, ample seating and excellent service. It's quite dark and the natural lighting seeps through a little. I would've liked the restaurant to be a tad bit brighter, but I suppose that's why it's called Insomnia.. :P  Regardless, I'd come back anytime! The waitress serving us was very friendly and accommodating with alternative recommendations (regarding allergies).  I was leaning towards the traditional breakfast, but ended up getting an eggs benedict (without the hollandaise sauce). Although, the sauce is a big part of the actual meal, I still enjoyed it a lot!  The eggs benny is served with home \"fries\" and a small salad. Their home fries/small potato bites come mixed with a very unique ketchup-y sauce. It's delicious! My friend got the french toast and it looked awesome.  Next time I'm feeling brunch, I'll be making my way over here."}
{"text":"Ordered through Hurrier - chicken & waffles, fries (never received), pink velvet cake, cheesecake and flourless chocolate cake. The chicken was juicy and the waffles were fluffy - pretty tasty. We had a bite of each cake but they were all lackluster and didn't get eaten.   Major downside, we both spent the next couple of hours in the bathroom.  Never again."}
{"text":"expensive brunch but absolutely yummmm. really liked it, yes it is busy and yes it is cramped. two things that are common on bloor st during brunch hours. cant say much about lunch or dinner but weekend breakfast was spot on."}
{"text":"Every time passing by this restaurant, I see good atmosphere, nice interior, and people eating something delicious. So I decided to try this restaurant. However, the service was awful.  I went to there weekday lunch time. there were few table available, and I expected to wait a little bit to get our foods, but it took over 50 min to serve us foods. I was thinking they went to metro to buy some ingredients or cooked super special delicious burger for us. I asked a waiter that our foods took so much time and other people looked like enjoying their own foods even though their order was later than us. It was very disappointing experience and I may not try never ever again. Foods were nothing special, I guess. It is really hard for me to enjoy meal if I feel uncomfortable..."}
{"text":"I love coming here! I've had breakfast and dinner here and the food is great! The staff are friendly! Would recommend insomnia to my friends, definitely a new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Had a day off today and was looking for a breakfast/brunch place close to home with the GF.  I have walked by this place for years but was always somehow intimidated....oh, how I have wasted many many meals at other places.  We were promptly seated near the window as soon as we entered. Place was clean and nicely decorated with music playing in the background. Loud enough to hear but low enough to carry a conversation.  We both ordered the prix fixe menu and everything came out quickly. I had the mini waffle which was fantastic! Wish I ordered a super sized version. Had the classic benny and GF had the florintine both which were awesome. Like other said I was also a little skeptical of the home fries covered in sauce but they were great. Dessert was good too.  Service was great! Did not get the name of our server, a tall fellow,  but he was great! Polite, prompt, always wore a smile and was not pushy.   I will definitely be coming back and try other menu items or just for a drink."}
{"text":"I love how inexpensive this place is for the portions that you get. The service is always pleasant and I'm always full."}
{"text":"We stopped by here for lunch, when our team was running miss Asia love Toronto scavenger hunt on June 29th, 2014.  The brunch here was awesome, and the staff here was amazing! She kindly helped us finish few scavenger hunt tasks: running our own food, having dessert with a lighted candle :3 I will visit again, if I am in the area next time."}
{"text":"Pros: Great food and service, cute decor...try the chicken and waffles!  Cons: Way too noisy for me to enjoy a nice dinner (had to constantly shout at my date to be able to have a conversation). All that noise gave me a headache afterwards"}
{"text":"This place started out at a four star review, the food was very good, the service was not awful (hence the four, instead of five star original rating) then, out of nowhere, the lights were dimmed and the most awful top 40 \"rap\" started blasting!!! We then couldn't find our server because she was so busy serving tables like ours who were trying to get the heck out of there ASAP!!!! Had to sit for 20 minutes in the midst of a sudden club atmosphere when I was just trying to have a nice, laid back dinner and some drinks. (Drinks menu is great, I just CAN'T understand why they would turn it suddenly into a club!!!) awful."}
{"text":"I think everyone in the city has been here at some point.  I've been for brunch and wasn't disappointed, though it's been a while and I don't remember any details.    I was here for drinks a few weeks ago, though, and enjoyed it a lot--their winter cocktail list was lovely, with a number of seasonally appropriate drinks.  (My friends and I joked that the Huynh, which I ordered, was kind of like fancy Neo Citron thanks to the limoncello and honey, but it was delicious and way more complex than its ingredients would suggest.)  Service was prompt, especially for a large group, and our server, when asked to suggest a shot for the birthday girl, brought out a ridiculous Bailey's and whipped cream concoction that was perfect for the occasion."}
{"text":"I've been to Insomnia on many dates and with various friends over the last couple years, I've always gotten good service and enjoyed their food and drink specials. We had a really great hangover breakfast once there as well even though previously I had never thought of it as a breakfast spot. It's a go-to spot, I've had the bartenders make me some great drinks off the menu and it's good for groups as well as intimate for couples. I've done espresso and tea there..pretty much everything. In general living in the Annex there aren't too many loungy places for couples, this place is perfect for drinks and food with friends without 19 year old university kids or rowdiness (we're in our early 20's but there's a time and a place for that kind of thing i.e. the Madison)"}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe! I love the decor and art on the walls. I did find that the service was very slow and a simple glass of the house red wine to be a bit pricey, but I guess you pay for atmosphere. The salad I ordered was delicious so I would highly recommend the food, which is also great because the kitchen is open late! I would go back, but not if I was in a hurry."}
{"text":"Tried brunch with friends here for the first time and very impressed by the food. We are huge foodies and craved for a good brunch to start off the day. The staff were friendly and welcoming. We asked for help to take a picture and they did very nicely. I tried the Heaven on Earth french toast sandwich and was not disappointed . The portion was large and the food was filling. My friend had an egg benedict with rice patties. It is the healthier version and she said it tasted good too. I would def come back and bring my family with me to enjoy more of the food on the menu that I did not get to try. Definitely going to try a benedict next time!"}
{"text":"I have family visiting and needed a weekday brunch option that was close to the TTC, so we stopped by Insomnia this morning. There were only a couple of other groups there.   It took the server a little long to check in with us, but I think she was the only one working and after that she was extremely polite and attentive. Their coffee is spiced with cinnamon, which I was worried we wouldn't like, but it was actually subtle and delicious.  I ordered the heuvos rancheros and my parents both had the classic eggs benny. My mom asked for her eggs to be medium, and said that they were cooked perfectly. The potatoes were very saucy, but totally yummy.   Unfortunately, all three of us found that our food was really cold, which was disappointing, especially on such a cold day. Also, there was a bit of a mix up in the kitchen, and my mom got the isabel benedict (with tomato and avocado) instead of the classic (with peameal bacon). My mom wasn't going to say anything, but at the end the waitress came up and apologized for the mistake and took her meal off of the bill, which was very kind.   I've worked in kitchens myself, and I remember that sometimes when its slow is when you make the most mistakes. I'm sure my experience isn't typical of this restaurant, but I don't know that I'll be rushing back."}
{"text":"I have absolutely  nothing bad to say about Insomnia, and it's been terrific for years.  The staff are always cheerful, friendly and attentive.  The menu is diverse and reasonable.  Great selection of alcoholic and non drinks.  Cozy atmosphere that is great for business meetings or friend lunches in the day and a fun vibe at night for cocktails and snacks."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing! I had the salmon Benedict it was GREAT the drinks were great the mojito was the best Collin the bartender was so nice and made the best drinks EVER!!"}
{"text":"Great place to go, especially to get food late at night. I had the most amazing burger there, I have not had such a perfect burger in a long time. Great service. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Threw my boyfriend a surprise birthday here. The restaurant itself is really nice and I was glad I chose the restaurant but for some reason I had bad luck that day.  The waiter took my order but forgot to bring me my food. I was the only one at the table with no food, when I asked him where it was he said that he screwed up and forgot to put it in. That was fine because they made up for it by giving us a free round of shots which I thought was really nice of them.They really helped with giving my boyfriend a nice surprise. So service and ambience is  good, but food is ok to poor.  The food was mediocre, nothing special, then again you get what you pay for, and the prices are average.  Would I ever go back? Maybe, because I think I might have had bad luck that night."}
{"text":"Really impressive Brunch!!! Today's Brunch was the best reason that push me to have a yelp account!! I went there at about 10:55 and I didn't wait. Firstly, good atmosphere and tables weren't too closed( but for me, I wanted a larger table:P ). The coffee was great( and with refills:) ) I ordered a Charlotte which was egg Benedicts and smoked salmon. I actually asked to put hollandaise sauce aside because it was my first time to taste it...However, the sauce blowed my mind. The eggs + the sauce was fabulous and impressed me so much that I enjoyed every piece with the hollandaise. The eggs was cooked perfectly to the point.(The server told me he cooked himself,awesome job!) Finally after the bill I received a little surprised that students might get discount on weekdays foods and drinks~~~ All in all, a really impressive experience, highly recommended and I will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!! The service is also very friendly. Reasonable price. The only drawback is the wait line because they are packed all the time."}
{"text":"Probably the finest bartender I have experienced  He made me a Toronto Sour (brown butter infused bourbon, amaretto, lemon, egg white, pecan syrup, boot beer bitters, fernet), which was literally the best cocktail I have ever had -- Ever --  Next I had a paper plane, which is a classic I have never tried. It tasted great - delicately balanced.  Had a deliciously elegant shot - super smooth - by this point, I remember little about it except it tasted great.  Also, had a sip of my companion's two drinks - both of which tasted great.   FANTASTIC BAR!"}
{"text":"I wish that I could break my rating out by \"meals\" because I had drastically different experiences with dinner vs. brunch.   Dinner = 3/4 Brunch = 1  Let's start with dinner!  A girlfriend and I went with zero preconceived notions other than some random heresay of goodness. It boiled down to location for us. Who wants to venture off of the subway line in Canadian winter? We were met with some pretty serious enthusiasm from a bubbly server. I could see some people being put off by her but she grew on me. The atmosphere was cozy and cool without being pretentious. They have a great drink menu and the server was able to recommend drinks that would pair with our meal selections. As a vegetarian my options were a bit limited but overall the menu sounded great. Several glasses of wine later we both agreed that we would happily return for soiree in the future.  Brunch  After the dinner experience I thought that brunch was likely to be off the hook. Unfortunately our experience was quite the opposite. Please expect a line up. Not a deterrant for brunch in the T.dot but good to know on those mornings that you wake up ravenous! Once you do get a table do not expect any deep conversation. The background noise was so loud that I found myself yelling at my significant other. I already struggle with a mumbling habit so this is an absolute no go for me. At first glance the menu looked great but again a bit limited for my people (the vegetarians). I opted for the a blt type sandwhich sans \"b\". In order to spice it up a little I added cheese and avocado. I was able to order a soy mocha which is a nice touch. Unfortunately it was weak to the point of being undrinkable.   Food arrives, excitement grows! We're starving and it looks great. Don't judge a book by its cover. The food was pretty tasteless and incredibly unfulfilling. The only oomph to the meal was the homefries which are interesting after the first bite...offensive two bites later. It appears that they are trying to distinguish themselves with something different but it ends up being potatoes drenched in cheap bbq sauce.   Biggest disappointment of all? It ain't cheap! The bill was close to the same as a dinner the night before.   I'm open to trying out Insomnia again for drinks but will never be back for breakfast. not with all of the other amazing restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Insomnia is too cool for school, and I often walk in wondering if it's too cool for me, too.  I have so many gatherings of friends, birthday drinks, etc, that happen at Insomnia that I will go there from time to time, but it is rarely my first pick.  That being said, the cocktails and food are delicious.  The tapas-style appetizers are more upscale than your usual pub grub, but still inviting and approachable, and great to share with a group.  Their pizzas run on the smaller side for the price but if you get one to share as an appetizer you will not be disappointed.  Their sandwiches are also tasty and some of the more reasonably priced menu items.  The main issue I have with Insomnia is that it's got too many \"too\"s.  It's too cool for school, as I said before.  By that I mean, the people in there are often looking to be seen, and in a sense Insomnia feels like an arty Queen West bar that somehow got lost on the way and settled down in the middle of the Annex.  Next, it's too small.  Seating can be cramped and getting even seating for a medium-sized group can be incredibly frustrating.  Bumping right up against the major Bathurst-Bloor intersection space means that when you step out for a phone call or to meet someone (or for smokers), sidewalk space is at a premium.  Lastly, it's just too damned loud.  Yes, it makes me sound like an old lady, but for the life of my I cannot hold a conversation in that bar without ending up practically in someone's lap trying to hear them."}
{"text":"Insomnia is a fun place to be. Great buzz and atmosphere. I like their brunch menu. I will def try it for dinner or even late-night. If you can handle alcohol at the mid-day they, the drinks look really good. I, however, prefer coffee. I highly recommend going on the weekend so you can order the oven baked pancakes... WOW... I got mine with chocolate (because it is delicious). The pancakes are fluffy and crispy at the same time. I didn't get a chance to taste anything else because I was wrapped up in my food. I am sure the Eggs Benedict are amazing - at least they looked it. Can't wait till I get to go again."}
{"text":"Well, It's now May, so nearly a year since my previous review, and I've been back to Insomnia several times. The best memory being on New Year's Day when we got a table near the back with those super comfy lounge chairs that perfectly suit a glassy-eyed hangover and the endless refills of cinnamon scented coffee with brunch, brought by sympathetic waitstaff who notice when your cup runneth low. That was really the visit that persuaded me.   We came back on a few Sundays (most recently two weeks ago) because the vibe is upbeat, busy, with good music, it feels like a Toronto brunch place. I've even brought my visiting uncle and aunt here. So I'm writing an update.   Since the first time I came, the staff have impressed me with being very on the ball regarding issues of gluten-free / wheat-free, clearly everyone has done their homework on this one, which I really appreciate. The waiter remembers, too, from one visit to another.   I always get the eggs benedict since that is my favourite brunch treat, so I can't really speak to other dishes, and I usually get the gluten-free toast option, although they also offer rice patties instead of bread if you prefer.   The eggs benedict come with various options, and I've had them with a classic peameal bacon, a smoked salmon, and a pulled pork version. They're all really good, through i recommend trying the pulled pork since you don't get that everywhere. Insomnia also makes their own hot salsas that you can just request on the side instead of tabasco, a milder green one and a spicier red one. The plate comes with a nice baby greens salad and a slice of orange, and the famous home fries slathered in some kind of sauce that is an Insomnia signature. It's worth mentioning that the eggs are always perfect.   They have free wi-fi, just ask for the password. Also, for when you're zoning out, there are excellent ceiling lights....  PS: Just noticed there is a coupon deal on currently for Insomnia if you are thinking of trying it. http://www.travelzoo.com/ca/local-deals/Toronto/Restaurant/50449"}
{"text":"Great food, nice ambiance. I've been to this place probably about 7 times over the past 5 years or so and it has never disappointed. I do get confused when I get offered multiple options for Rum though. I will need to learn more about Rum. If you are there late enough they always have dj's spinning music in the background. Service is good. Last thing I tried was the walnut penne which was definately tasty."}
{"text":"Good place for brunch. Unfortunately a mix up with the kitchen and an unresponsive and uncommunicative/unapologetic server meant we had no service/food/update for over an hour after ordering. The manager was notified when we complained and rectified the situation. His responsiveness means I will give this place another try!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times. Fish tacos are the best. Brunch menu is good and offers variety of items from traditional omlett to French toasts and Benedicts. Definitely try the \"heaven on earth\" french toast which is mixed with berries and cream cheese. and \"Isabelle\" Benedict is also delicious if you wanna GI with Benedict. The service is pretty good and the environment is amazing."}
{"text":"COME HERE IF YOU WANT CRAP SERVICE!!!   First off, I have used Yelp, but never felt the need to sign up. This restaurant gave me such a bad experience I have decided to just get this account just to write this review.   Okay first off, the food is not bad so that is great. The service and communication is by far the worse, no other restaurant I have been to was this bad. They are not only slow but, unapologetic for their mistakes. Usually I let things slide but 2 really bad experiences of the 3 times I have been is enough for me to be more than slightly annoyed.   1st experience: Was for my friends birthday party, we called in early to book reservations in 1 week in advance. Turns out they screwed up our reservation and booked us for the week after, instead of the week we asked. The only reason we found this out was because we called in 2 days in advance to reconfirm the reservation. They \"changed\" it but when we got there, another group got the table we wanted so we had to settle for the couches and lower tables that we specifically said we didn't want. Mind you this was a big group so we had 12ish people. First off they didn't say sorry for screwing up our reservations, they also didn't say sorry for putting us at the couches and more lounge area. So that is fine and all, birthday continued. We also brought a cake for the birthday girl, but only after they served us the cake they told us there was a cutting fee. They didn't even tell us before hand even seeing us hold the cake?!?!?! To top the icing on this cake they also had a mandatory service fee in which I do NOT believe they deserved. I am all for tipping the servers, because they really deserve it, even if they didn't do much. But these servers were unaccommodating and no sincere apologies were made. Needless to say we left on a sour note.  2nd experience: This experience was very recently, some time had pasted since the last incident, so I thought I would give it another shot. We called in 40mins before hand to try to make a reservation for 7 people for another birthday. They told us there was a table leaving and they could make it actually work, so happy with the quick response and \"luck\" we walked over (taking us 30 mins to walk over). When we got there, I told them I had reservation, they looked at me and asked if I was the one that just called. I said yes, they then quickly dismissed the fact that they said they had a table for me (knowing I called to confirm before walking over) and told me to wait an hour and there is actually not table, and that he pretty much lied to me over the phone. I wouldn't have been so upset if it was sincere, he didn't even say sorry till I started to question why he didn't have a table. In the end we didn't even end up going there to eat, which is for the better. I think this time, maybe the last time I will ever go here for food. The food is good, but not worth the crap experience of service.   In conclusion: Eat here if you want horrible service, lying staff, and a hidden \"cake cutting service\" (which was about $15 for the whole cake). The food is okay, but not worth the crap you have to go through."}
{"text":"Just when I thought it couldn't get better, it did. Great service friendly staff and unbelievable food. Had the huevos Rancheros with bacon on the side, it was a 10 out of 10. Love this place."}
{"text":"Tasty home fries.  Nice coffee. Would def come again! Very close to TTC station. Great place to hang oh with friends in a nice afternoon"}
{"text":"My second visit there in 6 months and again thoroughly pleased :) The food is delicious! and the service is just great. Wish I didn't live in the opposite end of the city. I'd be there a lot more."}
{"text":"I went there with my boyfriend because we had this coupon from U of T. Have to say their spinach pizza was one the best that we 've ever had. The interior decoration was also pretty great for a date!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite brunch place in the city. I love the food, l love the vibe, and they have the best coffee I've ever had in a restaurant. My hubby and l ate here today and while we had to wait a little longer than usual for our food, it IS the long weekend in May and our server, Liana, definitely made up for the inconvenience by being attentive and whatever the word is for charming I'm supposed to use for women. I can't really recommend any particular food because I've had everything, and other than maybe greens that are a little more wilty than my liking, and the fact that they put a piece of fruit on your plate even when you've ordered one of their phenomenal savoury dishes like the memphis benny is trivial, and l don't even know why I'm mentioning it.   Give this place a shot, have an open mind, don't be a d-bag, and l assure you, you'll end up a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Take out heaven on earth. It is cold outside, so kind of affect the quality. Not bad, but far below heaven. Maybe I shouldn't take out:("}
{"text":"Love their $4AFTER10 deal! Everyday from 4 pm to 10 pm they serve a great selection of beers and rail drinks for only 4$ !  I recommend getting the Fish tacos, Calamari and ANY of their pizzas-they all taste so amazing. Take-out is also offered and is very good. Thanks Insomnia. My friends and I will be back over and over and over again!"}
{"text":"Cosy restaurant with young staff, absolutely friendly and welcoming.  Food was amazing, interesting dishes with combinations of ingredients that are not found everywhere. However, these are also a bit pricy"}
{"text":"I have always come here many times, for the past few years (four years). And in the past few years a lot has changed.   New management, new bartender, new feel (change from casual to fine to trendy dining), and added DJ's, then no DJ's.   I just want to say that the one thing that has been the same is the amazing brunch, they have the most delightful brunch. I think it is all-day-brunch! The coffee is fresh, I've noticed that they grind it up.   Added new things: a midnight snack menu from 10pm to 2am serves you with $5 dollar plates of amazing gourmet meals. I just moved in around the corner so it is likely that on nights during which I am intoxicated, I will stroll in for a plate at 1 am. Kitchens that are open late at night rule! Like fried chicken and waffles and great breakfasts and burgers. Great addition of Cajun food to your menu!   Also the drink specials daily are a great new addition. You can get pints of Augusta Ale or Spearhead on tap on days like Wednesday for $4 or $3 mimosas and Jaegermeister too.   These are stellar additions !   Just recently I went for dinner. I definitely recommend the Insomnia Burger! It is a double decker of two huge Canadian beef patties in an amazing bun, and it has a really nice havarti cheese on it. The sides are lovely; salad, and your choice of fries, potato, poutine, or bread, and etc! That with pint of $4 Augusta Ale on a Wednesday night in the Annex, so wicked!  Another wicked point on their poutine is that, unlike smokes poutine or any other popular poutine joint, they actually layer the gravy and the cheese curds In the bowl of fries. Most places will just pour the gravy and cheese curds on the top, which makes travelling to the bottom of the poutine boil quite uneventful and dry. But Insomnia layers it through out the bowl, so as you keep getting down to the centre or the bottom of the bowl, there is always treasure to find !  Go here ! Brunch and lunch here is ideal !"}
{"text":"Insomnia satisfies every checklist item for being part of the Toronto \"Brunch Industrial Complex.\" It's the go-to millennial weekend brunch place, so expect a long wait on Saturday and Sunday. They're iffy with reservations (check the website for when they do/do not take them), so would call when they open on weekends to reserve a table for a few hours later during prime brunch time. The food is good; however, note that their coffee is spiked with cinnamon, and the roasted potatoes they are known are dubbed as such because they are tossed in a sweet barbecue sauce. So if you're not a fan of these two things, I'd suggest an espresso-based drink and/or subbing the potatoes. Staff are nice and attentive, and will even plug your phone into an outlet behind the bar if you fell asleep the night before without charging it."}
{"text":"First-timer for brunch (before going across the street to Bloor Docs). The host was very organized and managed the lineup well so we were seated pretty quickly. The menu looked as promising as my friends (repeat customers) had told me it was. We ordered drinks and then, about 10 minutes later, food (I had the huevos rancheros). No drinks yet. I had a view of the bar and could see that the bartender - and I want to be charitable here - is the type who is easily overwhelmed. Bad idea to leave him on his own during a busy shift. Food arrived soon after. Nice plated presentation. No drinks yet. Asked the waitress who shrugged and said \"that's what happens when you have five guys making food and only one making drinks\".  Now I'm confused - the service at Five Guys is way faster than this. Drinks finally arrive. Things start to get better. Until I start in on my eggs, which are overcooked. Not the waitress's fault. She couldn't possibly know because while always within eyesight she never came by to ask how things were. Ordered coffee after we were done. Asked for sweetener. She points at the jar of what looked like sugar. \"There it is\". \"This is sweetener?\". \"Oh, you want SWEETENER!\". Gets me some pink packets. Judging by the other reviews here either I caught them on a very bad day or the Bloor & Bathurst crowd has disturbingly low standards. I won't be back to find out which.  May 31st update - the owner (Daniel) reached out to me to apologize for the substandard experience and ask for more details. I'm always impressed by owners that pay attention to customer feedback."}
{"text":"I have been attending brunch services at Insomnia for almost a decade now.  Some things have changed, like, when they used to give you individual bottles of water instead of a carafe (yeah, it was weird and I'm glad it didn't last) and the art on the walls always rotates (sometimes, thankfully) but it's the consistency that counts.  Eggs Charlotte.  Your typical Eggs Benny with smoked salmon instead of ham, and my god, do I love it.  And they always toast my english muffin extra-well, just as I ask them.  Sometimes when I am really itching for that fuzzy-toothed-feeling, I get the Eggs Florentine, and they've added another variation of the Eggs Benedict format that includes avocado spread, but really it's about the Charlotte for me.  Yes, the \"home fries\" are not your usual dry little nuggets but rather saucy big cubes of crispy potatoes that are not to some people's tastes, but shore do fit mine.  I haven't had one of the classic baked-in-the-oven pancakes in *years* but that's mainly because I'm starved for salmon, but an order of the chocolate-banana one (yes, one - one large, fluffy, sectioned pancake) would feed me for days.  Sweet-loving friends have also enjoyed the \"Heaven on Earth\" - french toast with berries and cream cheese.  It really does take fate and gods on your side to pick an ideal time to come, but I like the near-end-of-brunch time, as the friendly staff let me sit and drink as many coffee refills as me and my brunch date can stand, with nary a \"get-out-of-here\" laser death glare."}
{"text":"A nice relaxing place, even if the music is a bit uppity and dance-able. Comfy chairs and a couch or two. Good prices for drinks, and the food wasn't bad either.  I went there once to see my friend's art and it's not a bad place for this, though you can't really stand and stare at it. Depends on how you like looking at art I guess.  Service was okay, since it's usually busy it sometimes can take a while for the server to get back to you.  For small groups it's fine, for larger groups, you'll have to find another spot."}
{"text":"I would say I'm a almost try to be a weekly reg. for my French  Toast.  Too late today do i had their burger it was delish, forgot to take a pick  I  lovedd the garlic aioli.  I will get it again, if I'm  late for my FT fix."}
{"text":"The food is good, and the coffee is delicious. It's a good place to catch up with friends and I love that you have an option for reservations for an earlier brunch (before 10am)."}
{"text":"Like the atmosphere but the food is blah. Nothing's really changed in years. It fits into the Annex vibe but that's not really a compliment!"}
{"text":"I've done both early morning brunch and date nights here, and every time the atmosphere, service, and food has been incredible. Just found out about the student discount, which is even better.  The only caveat is the limited beer selection on tap, and the long lines at brunch. But I can put those two factors aside because everything else makes up for it.   Will be back!"}
{"text":"It is literally like another home for me, and has stood the test of time (4 years). It is definitely my go to place for Martinis.  Fantastic staff and great food. Everything is prepared with a honest and loving heart. It is not difficult to tell."}
{"text":"Insomnia's been around since the turn of the century. This restaurant consistently has great food, and a good selection of microbrew beer. It's dark modern-style interior is great for a date, or a big meal with the extended family. Always has outstanding coffee, and its vegetarian offerings are excellent. Menu changes often, usually due to seasonal offerings. Only issue with the place, is that it is consistently loud: it's hard to hear what the person next to you is saying. It's not they are playing loud music, it's just that the room appears to amplify sound. I come here often when I'm in this neighbourhood, and highly recommend it, even if I can barely hear the person next to me."}
{"text":"Insomnia was one of the best restaurants my boyfriend and I ate at while on holiday in Toronto! We met some of the employees out and about, and they invited us in for dinner the next evening. We are so happy we went! The food was great, the bartenders remembered our names and treated us like friends. I highly recommend this restaurant for amazing cocktails and great food. Thanks again guys, we'll be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"After a less-than-stellar experience (we had to ask three times over the course of 45 minutes to order) at Insomnia saw me writing a one line quick tip about never returning, the restaurant's owner contacted me through Yelp to see what he could do about changing my mind. Daniel was super sincere, offering his apologies for poor service which shouldn't have happened, and asked would I like to come back for a repeat visit with a credit placed on my bill.  Inviting a few of my friends, we went back this past Saturday night to give it another go. The difference was night and day! While I'm sure the message was sent that we were to be well taken care of (and boy were we ever!), from what I could see ALL of the tables around us were receiving the same great level of service. Roberta was fantastic, offering suggestions on what to eat and drink (Black Forest Martini? Ok!), and even though a few of my guests arrived later then the rest of us, we all received our orders promptly and at the same time -- and we all loved what we'd ordered.  She definitely made sure we all had a memorable experience.   What impressed me the most was how quickly Insomnia responded to my Yelp comment, practically bending over backwards to win back my favour and show us how a visit to their restaurant should be. I think that in this day and age, it's vital that companies respond to social media sites such as Yelp, and think that Insomnia should be commended on being so on the ball.  Once again, thanks to Daniel and his staff for offering us the opportunity to give you another chance. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Apparently we came during a rush so my compatriots sandwich took almost an hour.  However, it was the best sandwich ever and they didn't even charge us for it.   Since food took way long, we got two free shots for \"dessert\".  Yum!!   My salad was amazing .. amazing ... so good.    Didn't try any specialty cocktails but I'm sure they are very good.  Had a great wine though for not too much cash.    This place looks and is quite hip/trendy but the noise level was perfect for conversation and it was just dark enough to be pleasant but just bright enough to see my food (I hate restaurants too dark too see the food).  They fucked up my order (didn't want one thing) but I ain't mad."}
{"text":"Dropped in with friends for dinner and there was a long line, although I don't know why... The service was mediocre and the food was definitely not very good. Aside from the lines of tables they have at the front of the restaurant, they have awkward sofas for dining at the back, where we were sat. The ambience is unique and pretty cool but it is pointless if the food isn't good or even average.  Now, there are fairly good ratings for the breakfast and brunch so I will go back during the afternoon and it will hopefully be a better experience. But as of now, I don't recommend this restaurant for dinner."}
{"text":"I hate having to rate Insomnia poorly, but I just felt really disappointed with my most recent experience. I really like this place; the atmosphere and drink menu are really great and the service is generally very good. Tonight, which I do understand, they were short-staffed on a busy night, however it seems as though that the kitchen was backed up even before it got busy. We arrived before the dinner rush while the restaurant was still fairly quiet and it still took over an hour for our food to arrive. These things happen; but there was no apologies offered or reassurance that our food would be soon to arrive. We simply sat, waited and finally received our food. The dessert took a long time as well, unfortunately, and the person eating it did not enjoy it :( Trying to flag down the bill was also a long process.   I just kind of wish that they would have given a heads up that things would take longer and been communicative and at the very least offered a 'sorry for the wait'.  As I said, I really do like this place but I just felt let down this time."}
{"text":"This review is for the dinner menu.  I had an arugula salad and poutine as a side order. The poutine is probably the worst poutine I have ever had in my life. Period. The portion of the main dish arugula salad (not a side order) is of the size of a side order for $11. Taste ok but only has pear, arugula and walnut. Feels very underwhelmed.   I'm losing any motivation to try its brunch menu."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and was pleased with my visit.  The decor is really nice and there are great paintings all over.  My party of 4 was lucky enough to be seated at the very back with the comfy couches!  It was nice to have extra comfy seating and a bit of privacy.  I found the waitress to be friendly and prompt (she even made sure to unplug/replug the router so I could use the free WiFi!!  Very much appreciated).  The waiter (who brought our mains) was also friendly.  The place has a really nice vibe - casual and cool that I feel is enhanced by the dark walls and furniture.  Also, the ladies washroom was clean!  I just wish it was a bit brighter in there.  I ordered the grapefruit mimosa ($5!) and I didn't really enjoy it only because I have a stronger sweet tooth (I should have gone with my first instinct to get pineapple!).  Not to mention, I found myself wishing I had gone with a Bailey's-spiked latte or Bailey's-spiked hot chocolate, like my friends had (they said they really enjoyed them!).  Next time, I will definitely try the pineapple mimosa and for 5 bucks, you really can't go wrong!  I just had to try the Memphis benny ($12) after reading great reviews.  The pulled pork was great: soft texture, sweet BBQ sauce, as you would expect a good pulled pork to taste like.  It was a great dish but I think I should have gone with their traditional (\"Classic\") benny since I've been craving a \"regular\" benny for months!  The eggs were properly poached (which I was very grateful for!).  The accompanying homefries were tasty too, having been tossed in a BBQ-like sauce as well.  I didn't eat the salad, partly because I was stuffed, also because I tend to ignore greens in favour of carbs!   Overall, I really liked this place and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a happening spot to grab brunch with friends this is your place! Food is delicious, offering the standard brunch items but with a twist. Eggs Benedict with pulled pork? Never had that before! Be prepared to wait as they don't take reservations. Luckily we only waited about 15 mins for a group of 5 arriving after 1pm. The service is good, despite them forgetting our coffee order multiple times, they tried to make up for it. The only thing I didn't like was the potatoes come drowned in ketchup. Overall, a nice place with a nice vibe and great location."}
{"text":"I went here for winterlicious 2016 and it was only for $25! I had the pulled pork taco, chicken and waffles and raspberry sorbet. The chicken and waffles was huge and I was definitely filled! Highly recommended for people to try!! Well priced and very good portions. The decor is very unique as well and we sat on couches!"}
{"text":"Mosh Pit, this ones for you! ;) Brunch - Bacon grilled cheese, home fries, mixed greens with chocolate milk Hubbys' brunch - Huevos Rancheros Egg, avocado, home fries with coffee.  Absolutely amazing food with impressive wait time. The atmosphere is most definitely relaxing and welcoming. Awesome seating arrangements and general flow. Clean and appealing. My server made my experience. Masha was the best server I've ever had. If I didn't know any better I would've thought she was an old friend! Since we were her favourite table she gave up complimentary shots! (I declined because I have a bundle of joy inside but my hubby was very impressed!) She complimented me on how I kept it such a secret ;) She's absolutely amazing and I totally recommend sitting near the back if you want the best server.  Overall, Insomnia is a Toronto go-to spot for brunch!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant recently and it definitely exceeded my expectations. 1. I arrived 20 minutes prior to my reservation and was still given a seat early 2. Our waitress was rather friendly...but I must say, she was acting a bit tipsy. 3. The wait for our food didn't seem like a wait at all  I ordered the chicken and waffles, and O M G. The chicken was so juicy, nothing like other restaurants offer. The waffles tasted nothing like the freezer kind, they were so large, drenched in a maple syrup/ spicy drizzle. My partner ordered the nachos for an appetizer, little did we know, the nachos can actually serve FOUR people. The serving of the nachos were so grande, but nothing short of delicious. He also ordered a burger (Can't remember the name) , with a side of poutine. He really enjoyed both, especially the gravy because the gravy tasted nothing like the typical chicken/ salty kind. It was actually sweet tasting...  Definitely recommend this place, and remember to show your student card to get 20% off! They will not mention the discount to you even if you look as young as Matilda."}
{"text":"Hubby and i went on a date here and the food did not disappoint. Although a little on the expensive side, we loved the food and the ambiance,but the customer service was a bit of a let down. The waiters took forever to attend to us, and didn't bother to check in through the dinner. We had three different people serve us, one of whom seemed quite snooty.  Re:Food. We started with a snack of hummus and tortilla chips. I did expect that the chips would be baked but it was oil fried. We also ran out of hummus well before the chips ran out. After a while of not attending to us and the chips getting cold, the waiter made us pay extra for more hummus. That was a bit disappointing. What made up for the disappointments in service however was the main course. I got the lentil shepherds pie and absolutely loved my plate.. The presentation, the flavour, texture and portion size was great. Hubby had a chicken schnitzel and he like his dish too but found it a bit subtle for his taste buds.    Overall the main entrees rocked. Will have to come back here if they have more vegetarian options. But the CS can certainly use some improvement."}
{"text":"I consider myself a brunch connoisseur, having lived in both DC and now NYC, where brunch is A. Serious. Thing. (and because it's definitely my favorite meal of the day). Insomnia was my first Canadian brunch spot, and it did not disappoint.   My friend and I came here after Grapefruit Moon had a line out the door, was too tiny to wait in, and we were told all credit card machines were down. Fate was on our side, because we opted for Insomnia instead. It was a 20-min wait, not too unreasonable for a Saturday afternoon at 1 p.m. We were seated right around the 20-min mark in the back. Try for there if you can! They have some insanely cozy tables and couch-like chairs. Just what you need after an intense Friday night.   Service was great. Our waitress was on top of it all, and we never had to wait to try and grab her attention. The other Yelp reviews don't lie -- the coffee is outstanding. Cinnamon flavored, delicious, and free refills. I had my first Ceasar here, which my friend remarked was a bit watered down when we first saw it. Once we sipped it, we realized why it looked that way; they did NOT skimp on the vodka. That's the kind of watered down that I am ok with.   I ordered the huevos rancheros, which were great, and those potatoes! They should just rename them crack potatoes.   All in all, it was a wonderful brunch experience. So happy that this was my first Canadian spot; not sure how others will measure up to this now!   PS. They accept credit cards, but not debit cards."}
{"text":"Went for brunch with a couple of friends on Saturday morning. We waited about 30 minutes for a seat which was less than ideal. We went and ordered the Memphis Benny, Grilled Cheese and the Oven Baked Pancakes. The home fries from the Benny was so great, we ordered a side order of it to share - the sauce is amazing. Overall the food was good for what it was but nothing super impressive. It was a bit pricey but very good. The service was great, never let our glasses get empty  Good food, kind of pricey and hopefully going to come back for the dinner! (Love to try the fried chickens and waffles!)"}
{"text":"Oh my this place is so good!   I hadn't been in 15 years and a few months ago a friend suggested we meet for a weekday brunch.  I have returned 3 times since because I am now addicted to their eggs Benedict and the potatoes.  One of the best eggs benny In the city, for sure.  And likely one of the only places you can find eggs benny at 10am or 1pm on a Tuesday!  The staff are extremely friendly and the service is amazing too.    Be warned, you may become addicted if you try it."}
{"text":"Had been here for brunch before but after eyeing the cocktail menu wanted to stop by in the evening sometime. Ended up here on a Thursday night with the bf and as expected had an awesome time. They had a special gluten-free feature menu that night, and despite being carb lovers, we decided to give it a shot.   What I ate: (Fixed price, $35)  -Grilled shrimp skewer with pesto aioli. Tasted great, shrimp was well cooked and the creamy aioli was a nice touch. Can't complain.   -Cajun salmon on wild rice with mango salsa. This was delicious. Honestly some of the best salmon I've had. It was cooked perfectly and I only wish I had a second piece because I'm a greedy glutton like that. The mango added a nice sweetness to contrast the cajun spice.  -Climax cake. Rich chocolate cake with a nice strong espresso flavour. This was pretty good although I enjoyed my dates dessert a little more which was a simple chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream. Can't beat the hot brownie, cold ice cream combo.   What I drank:  -Bourbon sour ($13) As previously mentioned I had initially wanted to stop by for the cocktails and I have to say this first one was a bit disappointing. I like my bourbon sours, well.. SOUR. Unfortunately this one lacked a bit in that department so it fell a bit flat. Also seemed like they used a bit too much egg white but maybe I'm just being picky.   -Paper Plane ($13) This was an off menu drink I requested (bourbon, aperol, amaro nonino, lemon juice) and I'm happy to say it was delicious. The bartender said it was one of her personal favourites so I'm not surprised that it tasted great.   -Snowball martini (on special, $6) I had this one to go along with my chocolatey dessert and it also didn't disappoint. Coffee liqueur, butter ripple schnapps, creme de cacao and cream... Wonderful creamy texture. I probably could have had this for dessert alone. Wasn't overly sweet either.    Really had wanted to try the Smoking Gun (bourbon, grand marnier, tobacco and fig syrup, chocolate bitters) but I guess they're going through some menu changes and unfortunately didn't have some of the ingredients which was a shame. Also noticed they had some cool infusions behind the bar with charred pineapple, etc. Would love to come back and see what interesting things they're doing with those.  Overall, we were super satisfied with our meal and drinks. The bartender was even friendly enough to offer us a free shot of our choosing before we left which was awesome.   Great service, great vibe, great food. Will be making this place a regular in my rotation."}
{"text":"Great food & drinks! Pastas & Pizzas are delicious!   Love that the kitchen is open till 2AM every night..super convenient when youre hungry and everything is closed!"}
{"text":"Cool place, beautiful decor but sometimes hard to get a table without a reservation.  We had the chicken and waffles, and schnitzel dish. Chicken and waffles was fantastic. The schnitzel and gnochi was delicious but a little heavy. For dessert we ordered the chocolate cake and the s'more. Again the s'more was fantastic but the chocolate cake was a little too rich.  The service was amazing and very attentive. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I recently went to Insomnia Cafe for a friend's birthday. I really enjoyed this casual resto/lounge. We were a large party of at least 15 people. They accommodated our large party by providing us with the entire back area of the resto/lounge. It was great for socializing with everyone. Also want to mention that Insomnia is conveniently located across the street from Bathurst station.  The atmosphere was great for a birthday dinner or drinks or even a first date. Music wasn't too loud so it was easy to have a conversation. Service was quick and efficient for ordering drinks (considering we were a large party).  The food was fairly priced, $15 dollars for a pizza. I ordered the margherita pizza which was delicious - nice and saucy. I would definitely return to Insomnia Cafe."}
{"text":"I ordered the cheeseburger with sauteed mushrooms, and it was fantastic. It was the best burger I can remember, easily better than those of a particular new restaurant that only does burgers.   I had a brownie sundae for dessert, but I prefer those made by others. I like it to be very hot, otherwise it's a bit disappointing as this one was. I could have said so, though.  I found the prices reasonable. They don't accept debit, which is a little inconvenient."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for a very long time from mutual friends and finally decided to check it out for brunch. The other reviewers aren't joking when they say that there can be a long wait, but it was definitely worth it. Had the eggs benedict with the smoked salmon and my friend has the 3 egg omelette. The eggs benedict was cooked perfectly and the portion size was very fair for the price. From the bites I had, I thought the omelette could have used a little bit more seasoning. It wasn't bad, just didn't do it for me. Overall, a great brunch place and I'd definitely come back with a few friends to try a more dishes on the menu.  Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"I love this spot! They have delicious food, great wine, $3 vodka drinks on Wednesdays (I think that's the day), and the service is always wonderful!!  The ambiance is chill, with a DJ in the evenings that always seems to play the song I forgot I had loved back in the day. Overall, a great date spot!  Only thing is they don't take debit, just credit."}
{"text":"My partner's client recommended this restaurant to us and we decided to give it a shot. We ordered absinthe as our starter and it was an incredible experience! The water slowly dripping onto a sugar cube over absinthe while the sugar cube was lit on fire. Just WOW! We ordered chicken and waffle (of course) and mac and cheese (ooey gooey cheesy goodness). We loved this place so much that our server decided to give us free shots on the house too. Definitely will come back for more yummy deliciousness! Highly recommended and you get WAYYY more than you pay for!"}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices, extensive martini selection - what more could you want? Our server was especially lovely last time. I've been for dinner twice and will return."}
{"text":"I came in with my boyfriend on a Friday night expecting something low key (my mistake!). The tables were all full so we sat at the bar, which we didn't mind, and after my boyfriend ordered a Ceasar we decided to order our food to go. I'm really glad we were sat at the bar because I witnessed some seriously impressive bartending -- even the water I ordered had more effort put into it than usual (lemon zest and martini glass). We ordered the burger, pork taco and mac n cheese. The burger was alright, nothing special, the pork taco was lackluster for the price, but the mac and cheese was incredible!  The food took a bit long to come out but it was a busy night so that's understandable.  I definitely need to come back, hopefully when it's less busy and dine in. The ambience is great, I like the lights a lot, and the music was actually really good as well. The prices are fair for the most part, plus there's a student discount. I love how active management is in monitoring their yelp reviews and social media -- great customer engagement imo. I need to come by for brunch some day! If everything goes well I can see this becoming one of my regular spots, considering how close it is to my apartment.  The restaurant also seems to be very accommodating of large groups (reservations are available for bigger groups), so this would be a great place to go out with a group of friends for dinner and drinks (especially if you're all students who can utilize the discount)."}
{"text":"Came here on on a Sunday with le boyfriend for brunch, and man oh man was it delicious! Very decent sized portions, really great service, and the best part was that we were seated right away during brunch prime time (10:30am). Could not be more pleased or happy enough to give my recommendation :)  Memphis Benedict + Heaven on Earth (4.5/5): GAWD would I kill to eat these right now. Heaven on Earth is this gigantic french toast filled with strawberries, blueberries, jam & cream cheese. On the side they give you maple syrup to finish it all off. The toast is crispy while the inside is creamy. Definitely a choice item for those craving a sweet first meal of the day. I was weary of trying the Memphis Benedict since I'm not a fan of pulled pork. There is something about sweet meat that doesn't really sit right with me... BUT their pulled pork is more on the savoury side and probably one of my favorites in the city! They also don't skimp on serving you the pulled pork, like I said up top.. the servings are decent sized if not huge lol. Lastly, I'll need to comment on their home fries. It's tossed up in their \"legendary sauce\" which is some kind of ketchup mix.. but with some spice to it. It's pretty tasty, I enjoyed it! However, they get soggy near the end of the meal so it might be a good idea to ask for it on the side.  Cost (4/5): For $13/$14+tax+tip for each of our meals (we didn't order any drinks), I'd say this was a fair priced meal. It's presented well, it's a VERY decent sized portion, and I don't think they could have cooked it any better!  Service (4/5): Front of the house treated us with a smile, and our waiter was very pleasant. Table service was on par seeing as we never ran of water, and the food + bill came in a timely manner. No complaints here!  Ambiance (4/5): This is a really hip place. They have windows lining the front of the restaurant and Christmas lights that run to the back. Their bar is well designed such that it doesn't look messy, but tidy as they display alcohol that runs the entire wall up to the ceiling :P I have to admit that it does get noisy, and perhaps is alittle dark if your aren't seated in the sunlight.  Overall a great choice for brunch if you are super hungry, in the area, and not wanting to stand in line for an outrageous amount of time :)"}
{"text":"We found this place at the last minute before going to our concert. We had no reservations and yet they still accommodated us. Food was fabulous with dishes we hadn't had before. And our server was bubbly and fun. This place has everything we wanted and more. We will be going back - soon."}
{"text":"Insomnia has some great vibes and some seriously delicious food. I would especially recommend it to any university students looking for a good place to grab a bit with friends.   If you happen to be in the Annex, definitely check it out. The only thing I would warn you about is that it is pretty tight on space."}
{"text":"A friend and I ventured to Insomnia a second time recently after Daniel so graciously gifted us a gift card and we had an absolutely excellent time. This time I had the chicken and avocado sandwich with the arugula and pear salad on the side and both were delicious. Blush Mojito was just as amazing the second time around. What really stood out this evening for us was the excellent service we were given by our waitress, Bobbie! She was so cheerful and friendly and checked up on us often. She really made our night; we left commenting on how nice and sweet she was.   We'll be back again as we now have accumulated a list of menu items we need to try, the first being the friend chicken and waffles, and the next being brunch! Thanks for such great experiences, guys! :)"}
{"text":"My best friend and I always go to insomnia for Caesars and brunch. They have amazing sausage and put in extra olives whenever we ask. The staff is also really friendly."}
{"text":"I've passed Insomnia several times and been in for a short while just once before. Unfortunately, I was in a rush and didn't get to stay. I have many friends coming from abroad to review this restaurant and check out some of Toronto's finest and from your recommendations, this sounds like a lovely place. Can someone advise if this is a good place to host a large number of people?"}
{"text":"Insomnia was one of the few bars open on Christmas. The vibe was good, however the cocktails are severely watered down. Even a straight whiskey seemed like a half shot. Definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"Got a mac and cheese, the portion was so tiny I was still hungry after, and cost 14$. So, don't buy the mac and cheese. The grilled cheese my friend bought was 11$ and came with salad and fries, so if you're going to eat there for dinner, choose a sandwich option, the rest is crazy overpriced."}
{"text":"Has a very Brooklyn, NY feel in terms of the atmosphere and decor. The food was ok, but expensive. Large portions, though-  I can only eat through a quarter of it, usually! Overall, worth checking out.  Their hot chocolate is AWESOME!  I am editing this review to add more stars - I've never seen such amazing customer service. If a resto cares this much about their customers, they are well worth a trip..or five!"}
{"text":"I chose to come here for my birthday with 12 of my friends and I was so glad I did! The cocktail selection was great and I was so impressed with the service provided. We were a large demanding group and everyone left so happy. The food was great and the ambiance was perfect.  Thanks for the great time."}
{"text":"The brunch is worth the wait! I had the omelette with the pesto sauce and the potatoes are amazing! Mimosas were good too"}
{"text":"College-town and hipster vibes. Large portions. The French Toast is really good. Tangy House Special Home Fries. Accommodates lots of diets - veggie, vegan, hipster allergies. Wait staff is slow but very nice. Gets crowded fast, so come early and come hungry!"}
{"text":"This is place is great for brunch, a first date or drinks after a show - very versatile! The potatoes in their special sauce on their brunch menu are addictive! On a date? I recommend the boulevardier! And Thursday night is martini night! Perfect girls night start or finish!"}
{"text":"First time in at Insomnia for a work lunch and it was good. All three patrons in my party ordered the daily omelette which comes with your choice of toast, homefries in a tasty sauce and salad. Though the omelette itself was bland - the potatoes made up for it. Very attentive service was greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"I love starting my Saturdays here. It is definitely one of my favourite restaurants in TO: attentive service, amazing brunch menu and a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"A quick search of brunch places near our hotel revealed this place.  It looked a little bar-esque but in a cute hipstery way and I loved the plush armchairs we were seated in at the back of the restaurant.   The brunch menu was standard fare with both sweet and savory options.   I took a savory plate - eggs, bacon and homefries with some greens. The homefries were DELICIOUS and the portion was quite generous.   Prices were reasonable and the ambiance was nice and relaxed.   I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Brunch items consistently delicious with amazing home fries. No extra points for being extremely fancy but the flavors are consistently on point without overwhelming you with oil (as you might find at other places). The pancakes and waffles are extremely filling and the generous portion sizes will definitely fill you up."}
{"text":"Was really impressed with the food. I got Isabel (the one with avocado). The portion and the quality of the food was amazing. My friends got Charlotte and the one with pork. Tried both of them and they are pretty good, too. The waiter, Andrew, is really friendly and he constantly asked if we wanted refill, which got me really satisfied with his service."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch choices, try the pulled pork eggs benedict"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurant in Toronto!! You can order with your eyes closed literally! Anything on their menu taste AMA~ZING! Highly recommend the peameal bacon benedict and steak&egg for brunch! And they have a loooot of cocktails and drinks to choose! Great place to have a Sunday brunch with friends. And did I mention all the art pieces on the wall? It's like eating in a local gallery....AMA~ZING!"}
{"text":"This is becoming my go-to spot for a not shitty breakfast.   Great Caesars, they open early at 9AM (amazing), and friendly service. I often get the Huevos Rancheros with a fried egg. Coffee is made with cinnamon so it always tastes good.   Lisa is our favorite staff member there."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and fall in love immediately!  Had Minami ( can't remember the name clearly), it is a traditional benny but has fired curry rice as base.  Special and tasty! Fried potatoes come with their unique dressing, sweet and sour. I love it but my friend can not accept that flavour. Overall their brunch is worth to try."}
{"text":"I had never been here before a few nights ago, and my girlfriend kept telling me that it is one of her favorite places as she works in the area and a few of them frequent this place quite often. Let me tell you I was pleasently surprised the servers were on spot and the food was delicious. I ordered the chicken linguine and it was superb. Great place nice atmosphere will definately be back soon."}
{"text":"Ok, so firstly, I find it strange that it's called a cafe at the same time as a restaurant, bar and a lounge. They do sorta cater to all aspects, but not so much a cafe. This is besides the point, but misleading for first time customers trying to search up info on this place.  Their place is notably tight in terms of spacing (to be expected when you're in Toronto). The ambiance was nice, definitely casual but also good for the couple. I believe they had a plaque for award of being best first date restaurant in 2011.   Anyways, so I went with a group of 10 people and we had reserved seating. We were pretty late, so by the time we got there they had reserved an area for about 12 people, not sure if they had given up our priority or the other group had reserved before we did. Anyways, the other group was also late, and none had shown up. All of us had shown up, and were patiently waiting bar side (because they had no where else to wait), and despite waiting for 45 minutes, we were not given priority over the group who was even worst than us (a no show). This was quite frustrating, but the bar server was nice enough to offer us menus/drinks if we wanted them.  Finally got seated and ordered. I got the sirloin steak for $19 (b4 taxes), and it was one of the better steaks I've had in a while. It was cooked just right as per my preference and the steak was fairly big for the not too expensive price. Also ordered a martini cocktail and it was great tasting, although maybe missing a bit of the alcohol taste. Other friends ordered things like seafood linguine/chicken penne, salmon pizza, which looked tasty as well.  Would definitely go again, but reason why its a 3 star and not 4 star is: -bread was served VERY late (1 min b4 entrees came), not warm, and no butter knives given -waitress was good but also bad (she had the right attitude and served well but wasn't careful as she had hit one of my friends accidentally with a wine chiller bucket with wine inside) -reservation system could be better"}
{"text":"I took my friend here for her birthday brunch after I read the Yelp reviews, and since it was the closest place from campus. I think I made a good decision! We went on a Friday morning and we didn't have to wait for a table. The server was pleasant, the food was good (We had the prix fixe menu which was 3 items for 18$), but the only thing I didn't love was the dessert. The \"frosting\" on the salted caramel cupcake was a little hard like they had kept it in the fridge. Other than that, a pleasant experience! Also, I was hoping to get a student discount but the server brought out the bill really soon :S"}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me for dinner here after reading the positive online reviews about Insomnia's dinner menu. Sadly, we found that our experience did not live up to expectations. To be fair, it was late (Around 9:30 PM) and the restaurant was very busy.   After being seated next to a girl who had her bare feet up on the seat opposite to her (Eck!), we were left waiting for quite some time before having to wave down our waiter to order. He seemed disoriented and overwhelmed. When we placed our order we asked if he could change the dirty cups at our table for clean cups. We didn't get new cups until our food arrived. The food was also just okay, a little bland. My friend ordered the linguine and I had the shepherd's pie. Due to the poor service, uncomfortable environment and mediocre food, I doubt we'll be returning."}
{"text":"Weekday brunch. I had eggs Benedict. My boyfriend had steak and eggs. Mine was fine...but it lacked salt and the food was served room temp...not hot :(  . My boyfriend wasn't impressed with his at all!! How can you screw up steak and eggs?! It was all over cooked (asked for over easy and med-rare...got med-hard and well done). Wasn't a fan of the \"special sauce\" on the potatoes (a sweet bland version of ketchup?) or the cinnamon in his coffee (flavoured coffee is wrong!!). Sorry...won't be back."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday morning and very busy. Had to queue but we offered to sit and eat at the bar rather than a table so got seated immediately. Had eggs benedict with Salmon and bf had eggs benedict with pulled pork. Both were fabulous and we cleaned our plates. The only niggle was the coffee. Ordered a latte and it was a bit weak for my liking. I like strong coffee and think it needed an extra shot. Staff were so nice so I'm sure if I'd asked they would have added to make it stronger. If you like your latte strong make sure you ask for extra shot."}
{"text":"My first experience at insomnia wasn't the best however, after almost 6 months I returned to a much better experience! Now when they take down your name its electronic, so you provide them with your name and phone number and you receive a text when you're going to be seated. This was a huge improvement and made for a great experience. My friend and I decided to be seated a the bar and our drink order was taken quickly and throughout the meal was refilled. The only downside was that the food took a while to come out but when it did come out it was delicious.  I would like to say that after my previous review the owner contacted me to apologize for the poor service I received. I'm sure I didn't spur the change but he listened and clearly changes have been made for the better!  For these reasons I'll definitely return for another meal."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a good place to have dinner down at Bloor and Bathurst, and when we saw the reviews on yelp, we decided to give it a try.  Wow.  Although I don't even REMOTELY live in the area, I know I'll be heading down again very, very soon just to eat at Insomnia again.  WHAT A TREASURE.   I got the fixed menu 3 course dinner, which was decently priced and SO FILLING that I had to take the desert to go.  The food is absolutely DELICIOUS.  I got the pulled pork taco, which was excellent, and the fried chicken and waffles.  To say that the chicken and waffles was AMAZING is an understatement.  Easily the most delicious thing I've eaten in years.  The chicken had an amazing breading on it - perfect cooked, tender and moist.  The waffle was warm and soft, just enough maple syrup on it so it wasn't overwhelming or too much.  God, I want to be eating it again RIGHT NOW.  (That being said, I probably gained 10 pounds.  Diet food it ain't.)  And our hostess (Roberta was her name, I believe) was absolutely LOVELY.  Really friendly, excellent service, made us feel comfortable and appreciated.  Couldn't have had a better dining experience.  Overall, there's not many places I'd give five stars to, but this place earned it in stripes.  LOVED IT."}
{"text":"Me: The fish in my ($19) fish and chips has bones all through it.  Manager: We didn't butcher it.  I'll give you 20% off.  Me: Off everything or just my food?  Manager: Just your food.  Me:  I'll pay for a plate of fries and my drink, but nothing more.  Manager: Fries are like $8  Me: Whatever"}
{"text":"Mainly went for drinks with friends.  Friendly and attentive staff. Great playlist. Good vibe."}
{"text":"I have been here over 10 times in the past year for brunch (if you can't tell it's my go to place) but I've unfortunately never had the opportunity to come for lunch or dinner.   The restaurant is quite quaint and space is tight so it is kind of noisy but definitely able to have a conversation. The food is delicious and have everything from vegan/veg/meat etc. My personal favourites are the pancakes, salmon eggs benny, omelette. I found the french toast to be a little sweet. The cakes here are also incredible. I've always had extremely friendly servers and a good time. Prices are midrange and reasonable for a good brunch."}
{"text":"I came here last Thursday night and this place was packed! We were seating in the back as per our reservation request. This place was actually pretty tiny. We were sat on couches and honestly, the couches were too low in my opinion. Any way, I ordered a few drinks and I had the Chicken & Waffles at this place. Drinks were good, nothing too special, nothing too strong. I had a few cocktails. In my opinion, they were too tiny for their price. The chicken and waffles were good. I could not finish it as there was so much. I loved the syrup and it had a bit of cabbage on it.   I give this place a 3 star only because nearing the end, I did not like the service. We stayed pretty long (about 2-3 hours) and it just seemed like they wanted us out nearing the end as we were only sitting and chatting.   Anyway, good food, okay service, probably won't come back again."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch - you can even make a reservation for seatings before 10am!  Their eggs bennies are solid - but the real star of their brunch are the homefries slathered in \"legendary sauce\"; I don't know what's in that sauce but it's really delicious!!"}
{"text":"I came back for brunch (have you seen those pictures!? My god) and it did not disappoint. The food was outstanding and the service was top notch! Very friendly!   Glad I gave this spot another go."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and enjoyed my experience. On Thursday nights, they have a deal on martinis. I absolutely LOVE their martinis -- especially their Candy Apple martini -- it's delicious!   I can't say that I've tried their dinner menu, but I've come here one Sunday morning for brunch. There was a huge line up, took about 15-20 minutes to get a table for 4. I was thinking that this must be the place to go to in the Annex for brunch because of the big line up. However, the food was just OK... nothing special. Everything was kind of sloppy, like they were rushing in the kitchen to get food out. We ordered the pancakes, which are oven baked and take 30 minutes. The waitress was trying to steer us away from ordering those and opt for something else. Why put those on the menu then??? The pancakes were not very good. They were SUPER thick and heavy. Tasted like a giant muffin. The eggs benedict was just meh. The waffles were probably the best thing there, but not good enough for me to come running back to order them.   I've come here at night for dessert and drinks. The drinks are amazing and the dessert was just OK.   Verdict: Come here for drinks, maybe skip out on the food."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch in June, busy location and we had to wait for a table but the service was fast and the omelettes were good. The home fries were particularly delicious if i recall correctly."}
{"text":"Love insomnia. This is a staple for my girls brunch dates: yummy coffee, fabulous potatoes and the best pulled pork Benedict ever! Get there early to avoid waiting."}
{"text":"This Bloor West restaurant seems like it have lots to offer. From a stunning everchanging decor and intriguing menu that draw you in. We had to order three plates just to sastify our curiosity.   The Oven-Baked Pancake, The Heaven on Earth French Toast and a mini brunch with their self-proclamed legendary sauce and potatos.  So. well. Okay. Wow. First.  A Pancake is literally a Cake-like batter cook in a Pan. If you oven-baked a ''pancake'' its a cake. So be ready to receive a full size of Overcooked and flavorless cake served to you, with a side of sirup that is so existential if you dont want to eat a dry piece of cake.  The Heaven on Earth French toast wear its name quite terribly, with a thick ''french toast'' serving as bread for a sandwich of cold cream cheese and berries. With so much bread, its impossible to taste any of the filling and even if you could, the block of plain cream cheese does not balance well with the berries and blend bread. Its quite unambitious.  The legendary sauce is a peppery, vinaigry ketchup,overall not bad. Kinda flirting with the flavours of a BBQ sauce, it was intriguing at least for me to try to find which spices they were using.   The Rest, potatoes and eggs were merely average. Which is not saying much for such simple sides.   Imsomnia might not be the worst brunch i had in Toronto, but the Gap between expectation, the chef's ideas and execution is so large, its score is largely affected by it. Negative review might be fun to read or write, but they only make me appreciated more The craft of a Portland or Cluny and making sure hard work doesnt go unnoticed."}
{"text":"Nothing better than a filling brunch with reasonable price.  Heaven on earth French toast is amazing. Usually need to line up during the weekend"}
{"text":"Good, but not life-changing.   Went here for brunch with a friend. I had the smoked salmon Benedict and had a waffle substitute for the English muffin. I found that the hollandaise sauce lacked flavour so I was happy that salt and pepper were on the table. People have raved about the home fries, but they're basically just regular home fries tossed in BBQ sauce. But after taking a bite of the bland Benedict, the home fries somehow tasted better lol.   My friend ordered the chocolate banana pancakes which were good. They're not flapjack pancakes...more like dough put into a pan and actually baked. I have no idea how a normal human can consume the entire portion of pancakes. We took half of the pancakes home.   I was happy I tried it since this place seems to be such an annex mainstay. But I have no desire for a revisit."}
{"text":"Insomnia is definitely on my Top 10 list for Toronto brunch spots! A big plus: they take reservations.   Even if you don't have a reservation, you can leave your phone number and they'll text you when a table is ready. The staff here move so quick, I only waited around 25 minutes when the hostess originally estimated 45 minutes.   Seating is cramped in the front area but there are coat hangers on the walls so puffy winter jackets won't crowd up the seats.   My favorites are: 1. Memphis Benedict - pulled pork eggs Benedict served with home fries. I am in LOVE with their home fries and the addicting sauce they cover it with. 2. Heaven On Earth - If you're feeling for something on the sweet side, this dish with French toast and cream cheese won't fail you.   The menu is decently priced and the mimosas are awesome as well! Remember to check-in for $10 off your $50 bill!"}
{"text":"Went here for summerlicious and the food was very unique. It wasn't what I expected but it turned out to be delicious. Great atmosphere in the restaurant, very modern and artsy."}
{"text":"Since my last review, we've gone back for brunch several more times. Each time, it's been better and better. I always get the PLT, with strip bacon instead. The gluten free bread there is actually yummy, like a nice fluffy sandwich bread, unlike many restaurants with cardboard bread. The potatoes have been consistently crispy, but I always ask for them well done because I like them extra crispy.   The service has also been great. Many of the servers have changed but everyone we've had has been friendly and helpful.   Honestly, I'm really happy to see the brunch get back to where is used to be, maybe even better. We've been regulars for years and this place is one of the last few original Annex restaurants, so let's make sure to keep it that way."}
{"text":"Insomnia has been one of my favourite spots for over 6 years. It has a cozy and relaxed ambiance. It's a great spot for a casual meal or date night. The service is great and the food is tasty. What more can you ask for?   If you're trying to get an idea of what you should order: The fried chicken thigh sandwich (brunch/lunch), chicken linguine (dinner), mussels (dinner), or the memphis (brunch) are always a good idea.   I miss their cabbage town pizza and Lindt chocolate ice cream."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night since there were tables available unlike many of the other places in the area. Reading the reviews it may seem like more of a brunch place but the dinner menu is great too. Lots of unique options, and their staples are done right (try the Insomnia Burger). A+!"}
{"text":"Nice little lounge.  Very comfortable and cozy.  I've come here twice for drinks and enjoyed both occasions.  I haven't had the food yet but next time I'm there I'll definitely sample it.  Great seating in the back with the little arm chairs."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner during winterlicious and it was great.  The food was great as was the service.  The only reason why they lost a point was because they only had one of the desserts left and it was still fairly early in the evening..  I will give them credit for dressing it up and being delicious though.   This place also deserves credit for its atmosphere.  I absolutely loved that they had hooks for our jackets behind our table.  It was so nice to be able to hang up our jackets close by and enjoy the atmosphere.  I also have to say that I loved that I didn't feel rushed here at all.  Our waitress was fantastic and gave us the option of having our dessert right away or letting us relax a little bit before bringing it out.  It's little things like that that made our experience fantastic.   We'll definitely be back to checkout their famous brunch."}
{"text":"I am in the middle of my meal and I have to say this is absolutely incredible. I went for a traditional 3 egg omelette with bacon/sausage with home fries and my gf did the Lorraine Benedicts. Simply put we are stunned at the amazing favour and quality in taste; and their Mochacino is too good to put into words. This kitchen staff know what they are doing and they are doing it well. Brunch spot #1"}
{"text":"Visited Insomnia on a recent trip to Toronto.  What a great find!   Went for the Sunday brunch.  Arrive early!   We got there at 9:15am, and by 10:30 it was packed.   Eggs Benny were done perfectly, the home fries were pre-basted in a spicy ketchup, and the coffee, which is augmented with cinnamon, was perfect.   My wife had the citrus french toast which was a bit heavy but delicious.   My son had a bacon-tomato-and cheese sandwich which was perfectly prepared.   Great service, great setting, will definitely return."}
{"text":"Very good brunch but requires patience - there is always a wait at brunch time and they don't really have anywhere for people to wait so you have to cram uncomfortably into the doorway (or in the street, but screw that in wintertime).  I think it's worth the wait but it will depend on your tolerance for waiting."}
{"text":"Ate there with family and it was terrific. The food was fresh and tasty. We enjoyed a variety of salads and tacos. They were all delicious! Loved the mixed greens salad and the kale salad and the fish tacos and cauliflower tacos were especially good. It has a great atmosphere too. Recommended"}
{"text":"I heard nothing but great things about Insomnia's Sunday brunch. I had to see for myself what all the hype was about, and honestly I don't get it. First, the line is over an hour long and second the food is mah. Sometimes I feel people think that a restaurant is good just cause there's a line."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch, a couple of notes:  1. The coffee is great. We asked the waiter, and it turns out they put cinnamon in the roast. Quite good.  2. I ordered the Eggs Benedict. The eggs were cooked well, and everything was wonderful, Eggs Benedict wise.  3. They served the dish with a side of potatoes, but they slathered these potatoes with the most disgusting sauce that I think involved ketchup, barbecue sauce and something else. Made the potatoes soggy and unpalatable.   4. Service was great."}
{"text":"I was visiting my friend in Toronto, and she brought me to this place. It definitely made my experience in Canada even more amazing than it already was. Heaven on Earth, that cream cheese french toast was life-changing. I never knew cream cheese goes so well with maple syrup and french toast!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Great ambiance, friendly service and the prices on the drinks are amazing! I will make this my regular spot for sure! Martini night is on Thursdays and they have daily specials after 10pm."}
{"text":"I like martinis. I like martinis with vodka. I like martinis with gin. I like martinis that may not taste anything like a martini.  I've hosted girls nights here. I've brought dates here. I come here with friends.  I recommend the Black Forest martini or the lemon drop. Food is okay. Drink a few martinis from their extensive drink menu and you probably won't care too much about what they are serving for dinner."}
{"text":"Great place to go for late night drinks and snacks. There are appetizer specials and drinks were a great price. On the weekends the place gets quite packed so be ready to have to wait for seats. The bar gets really busy especially after 11 pm, so order a few drinks at a time to avoid having to wait long for them. The restaurant has a lounge in the back and the seats are quite comfortable- Great place to just lounge with friends over 1 or 10 drinks."}
{"text":"It was a tuesday night and the place was still crowded (younger crowd ~20's) so my friend and I decided to get a drink here to check it out!  We ordered calamari po' boy from the late night menu ($5). Two cute little burgers came out and i thought the late night snack menu was perfect for.... well, late night snacks and drinks! I'm definitely going back to try their other menus!  My friend ordered the margarita and it was TERRIBLEEEEEEE There was too much salt on the rim and it just tasted so bad.  I ordered the X-rated vacation martini and this drink was on the sweet side, and was pretty good. For people who don't like the taste of alcohol, this drink would be perfect!   We also shared a half litre of sangria and it was.. meh. I've had so much better before.  Overall, the food and drinks were okay (just do not order the margarita) It's a perfect place to have a couple drinks with friends.   It is REALLY loud in there so my throat did hurt after being in there for a while because I had to yell over the music and the crowd, but I think I would rather spend the evening at a crowded bar than at an empty lifeless bar."}
{"text":"If I ever go back to Toronto I WILL make this place my very first place to dine at! They had amazing food, great drinks, dope music, and even better customer service! Those nachos were fire!!!!"}
{"text":"There's a reason why Insomnia is a Toronto institution!  If you're looking for some of the best eggs benny in town, this is the place to be. They have several eggs benny variations for meat-eaters, vegetarians, and pescatarians. Personally, I would recommend getting the back bacon eggs benny and add some smoked salmon onto it. The potatoes are amazing as well, and is another item that Insomnia is known for.  The staff is always friendly, which is refreshing considering how stressful working in such a busy restaurant is.  Speaking of busy, you should always get there early. Wait times can be over an hour or three on weekends.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"How have I only recently learned of Insomnia's brunch?!?  Insomnia has been one of my favorite date places for years - it's cozy and atmospheric, and just noisy enough to offer a little privacy.  But the brunch! The coffee has cinnamon in it, and it is good. The hollandaise sauce, which makes or breaks an eggs benny, is goood. The home fries are smothered in a barbeque-like secret sauce and it is gooood.  This is a brunch worth waiting in line for, yet I've never had to wait more than a few minutes!  Also, the cocktail menus around the place are intricate chalkboard works of art, created by one of the staff."}
{"text":"Let's talk about the potatoes that come with the brunch meal. They are everything. Somehow they're covered in sauce but still maintain their crispness. The rest of my meal was delicious but they were the star.  Overall Pros:  -potatoes  -large portions  -super inexpensive mimosas   Cons: -The brunch wait felt eternal and the restaurant really has no lobby/waiting area which is extremely inconvenient (especially since it's cold)."}
{"text":"Update: The lurid smell I formerly complained of is gone. My ex from Chicago loved this place and we came here every time he visited. We wanted to get a place around here and come here all the time. Then we broke up. Now there are way too many memories and I haven't been coming around as much. I also don't live as close.  It is totally full on a Friday or Saturday night; anticipate a 20 minute wait after 8pm. Made my ex try poutine here. He didn't like it, and thought gravy was terrible too mix with cheese curds and fries but it was a solid, savoury, melty poutine and not too drenched in gravy. However, its not really a thick-cut like Poutini's.  Drink prices have gone up by 50cents or a dollar, but that's concurrent with price inflation all over the world. This is a reliable location for wifi, as Green Beanery doesn't have it and a sign on their door says they have a regular thief right now. (and still. REALLY, Toronto?)  It's nice to come here for working on your laptop or to throw a drink back before ambling over to Altima for an ominous dental cleaning. It's also great for a friends date and one drink easily turns into two. Because of how close the cubby lounge chair-table units are... you will overhear a lot of OKCupid dates going on and that can be quite hilarious.  Now onto the good: coffee and alcohol. The coffee is always strong, they make a firm cappuccino. The craft cocktails are an economic and easy buzz. Ask for the \"secret\" hidden vintage cocktail menu that's only on 15 menus in the whole place. These drinks are both potent and delicious... But not too sweet. If you like bitter I recommend the sazerac or corpse reviver#2, if you like sour then paper airplane or pisco sour. Bonus stars for having fernet and cognac cocktails too."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the chicken n waffles. Healthy portions. The chicken was tender and juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The waffles too, were crisp, slightly moistened by maple syrup. I think I would have preferred more finely shredded coleslaw however the coleslaw provided was an interested and welcome finishing addition. I would definitely have it again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now, always for dinner. The food is great, the service is always nice, and I absolutely love the ambiance.  It's my go-to place when I'm in the Bloor-Bathurst area. I need to try the brunch sometime!"}
{"text":"For my girlfriends and I, Insomnia is our alternative to 7 West Cafe (Bay and Bloor area) for our catch up sessions. I've been 5+ times, which I think says a lot when you live in a city with so many great restaurants and bars. I've actually only been in the evening for drinks and the occasional snack, so I can't speak to this place as a brunch option - although judging from the brunch photos, I think I will give it a go. Below is a recollection from my visit this past Friday.  THE GOOD:  - Service is top notch. Finding a table downtown for three wine-thirsty ladies with no reso is usually a struggle - particularly on a Friday night - but the hostess took my name down and texted me within 15 minutes with a table ready. - The ambience inside is perfect for a date or catching up with friends: cozy, dim, and intimate. At the same time, it's a chill vibe - I felt so comfortable, I could've been sitting in my own living room. - The food is fantastic! We shared the $12 nachos, which were SO worth it - a great portion size with a more-than-generous helping of guac, cheese, and sour cream. My favourite part is that rather than give you a tiny plastic container of guac or sour cream on the side - which is usually not enough and not conducive to sharing - they just pile it on top. I ordered these nachos after seeing someone else with them en route to the washroom - I honed in on that guac-y/creamy/cheesy goodness and went, \"I need that.\"  - Lastly (and to some, most importantly), they have an awesome selection of wines, cocktails, and other drinks. While I stuck to a glass of Riesling, my friends had nothing but good things to say about the lemondrop martini.   THE BAD: - I've got nothing!  All in all, this is a favourite of mine in the Bloor/Bathurst area that I will continue to visit. I look forward to reporting back on brunch!"}
{"text":"Wow...this is what Yelp is for. There are a TON of restaurants in this area and Insomnia was right at the top of the list on Yelp. So...quick walk from my AirBNB and took a seat at the bar. Richard the bartender was quick to suggest some drink choices and I went with the Moscow Mule.  Now...c'mon Insomnia...go on eBay and buy some copper mugs. Despite being served in a glass, it was actually delicious and I probably got more drink for the money in the taller glass...but it should be served in the appropriate vessel.   But forget that...get over there and order the fried chicken and waffles. I'm still in a food cima and haven't enjoyed a meal this sweet and savory in more than a year (was a burger between two glazed donuts in Atlanta).   Great service drink and food. Awesome!"}
{"text":"A decent brunch place in a great location. The service here is prompt and friendly and there is lots of seating. The atmosphere is very relaxed and casual, and the menu is extensive.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict which took a long time to arrive but was pretty tasty, but unfortunately my meal was cold which spoiled it for me.  The home fries are very tasty though, and I couldn't get enough of them. These alone are worth a visit.  Don't forget to check in on Yelp for $10 off $50!"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot! Amazing food & the fries were crack. Can't wait to go back to Toronto and eat here again."}
{"text":"I'll say first that we very much enjoyed the food. We started with the mussels, chips and dip, calamari and chicken wings. The mussels were in a beautiful sauce. The struggle salad is also great! However my Caesar was ridiculously watery, why do they put so much ice in a tomato based drink?! (a problem that is not exclusive to Insomnia) For my part, I got the winterlicious menu and chose: pulled pork taco, chicken and waffles then carrot cake. The taco wasn't too sweet but nothing special either. The chicken and waffles had great presentation and delicious flavour in the chicken however the waffle was soggy and the coleslaw flavorless. The carrot cake was very nice. Also the wait staff was accommodating when one of our members sent back a main because they didn't realise it had a sweet sauce; they re-made it with sauce on the side. My issue is with the seating and bathrooms: they have some regular tables at the front but at the back for larger parties they have low chouchy chairs which aren't comfortable and our group ranged from 29 to 67 and we're all tall so no leg room. Next time I will make sure to ask for a regular table. The bathrooms are the typical rundown downtown basement washrooms but for a place that's trying to be somewhat classy, a fresh coat of paint and new locks on the doors would go a long way (and to empty the garbage), the solutions are too cheap to be ignored."}
{"text":"Extremely crowded, food is average and noisy . If you like that , then it's fine . But not my scene . Only convenience is location . Right across from the subway ."}
{"text":"My comfort zone extends no more west than Avenue Road, and on a gloomy Saturday morning, I was forcibly taken out of that zone, and brought to the intersection of Honest Ed's, and lead to a door I would have otherwise never noticed, if it weren't for the giant eyeball signage staring at all oncoming pedestrians. Surprisingly, I did not put up much of a fight when being instructed to go inside.  Don't stare at it!  We were met by an unfriendly Chinese Maitre'D, she did not offer me a single smile, or much of an acknowledgment at all aside from telling us that it'll be a ten minute wait.  Hold on, we don't have reservations?!?! ARGH! Okay, I didn't end up waiting too long, I think it was because there were only two of us, and my unending ambient complaining propelled our names on the top of the list. I don't feel bad, she didn't smile at me.  I had trouble understanding the menu, I haven't had brunch since boarding school. It always just appeared as if it was lackluster effort lunch, with eggs. I ended up getting the AAA steak and eggs, and my friend got the eggs benedict.  When the waiter asked me what I wanted for a beverage, I told him Redbull & vodka. I was met with a \"Seriously?\" Then he proceeded to tell me a story about another person ordering alcohol around the same time of the day. It was 1:30pm. Regardless, I was at a nerve away from decking him between the teeth. I don't need to be judged by my service staff. I just returned from Asia not a week ago, the service industry in North America has all dissipated to the air of shabbiness for me. I don't like hipsters. This place offers brunch til 3pm. I'm not the one with the f&%ked up hours okay. I had no idea what to expect, and my expectations for this place dropped considerably after seeing the horrendous sign, and being greeted by a Asian Racheal lookalike (think Blade Runner[that was a compliment]). But, and a big but. Despite the fact this place was absolutely buzzing, and our table was just about the size of the dishes itself, somehow everything seemed to fall in place perfectly. The obscure art on the wall wasn't displeasing, the lack of decor complimented the industrial tone of the walls, the uncomfortable looking couches were actually not uncomfortable at all. I can relax here, it's a miracle!  The food came. Triple A my ass.. But the home fries was bloody good. Not sure what sauce it was drenched with, maybe barbecue. The scrambled eggs didn't do anything for me. The eggs benedict was alright, but honestly, I don't like meals that resemble breakfast.   With everything said, my time here was not by any means, unbearable. This was supposedly my friend's favorite restaurant, and if I squint very hard, I suppose I can see why. The atmosphere is very engaging, and the crowd equally so. I can see this place offering shisha. It was overall very...chill.   The bill came in a metallic bowl, weighed down with a good sized piece of rock. I scanned the area for the Maitre'D..."}
{"text":"Great food and relaxing atmosphere. Lovely brunch choices - I really enjoyed the eggs benny! Only complaint is service; a little slow for my liking, and kind of hard to get in touch with server to ask for something else. Overall a pretty good experience. The food is wonderful, so I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We love this place is our regular night out so i really suggest this place to all of you who want have a couple drink in a cozy place."}
{"text":"I went back for their regular dinner service. It was even better than the first time I went. It was a Thursday night and our waitress said the drink special was classic martinis for $5, so I tried the lychee martini. Great decision, you can really taste the lychee and it was just sweet enough for my taste.  The \"OG mac and cheese\" was recommended to me, and I'm glad I went with that. It looks small but don't be fooled. I took twice as long to finish my food because it's so rich and filling. The bacon in the creamy sauce really made the dish for me, and the crispy onions were the perfect topping.  We couldn't leave without dessert, and we tried the s'more with burnt marshmallow ice cream. It tasted like they really took a mini torch to the cookie/cracker and it instantly transported me to my good old camping days. I really enjoyed it. I'll come back to try their other desserts."}
{"text":"One of my favourite brunch/lunch places with such a cozy, comfortable atmosphere. A little on the expensive side but great portions that are easily shareable. I've only ever gotten their dinner menu items on uber eats but it has never disappointed"}
{"text":"Really underrated but not sure why. The food is fresh, delicious and the ambience is nice and cozy (exposed brick, wooden accents - full on hipster vibe).   All of their eggs are done to perfection. Their homefries are easily the best in the city (because its lathered up in a lot of SAUCE) and their prices are very reasonable, especially with their generous portions. Their heaven on earth dish is easily the most popular and a must have (French Toast)...it will also make your Instagram followers drool!   Great brunch spot if you're not in the mood to stand in a 2 hour line for mediocre food (I.e. Lady Marmalade).   If I could give this 6 stars I would!"}
{"text":"We came here Thursday at Lunch and was seated right away. The atmospehre and the ambiance was really great, and our servers were fairly friendly. We received our food pretty quickly (faster than most places tbh).  We both ordered the ST.ALBAN'S CLASSIC - 14. Everything tasted amazing but we found the homefries a little overpowering (but it was still really great) the sauce on the vegetables was exceptionally done, but everything on the dish was very well prepared. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Got the Little Italy pizza. Twas meh. I think they added too much olive oil or some something because the top side of the pizza came out really doughy and pasty...blaaarh. The prosciutto was decent though."}
{"text":"Yes! This place is really that good - lines are consistently \"out the door\" for a very good reason. My friends and I had not eaten yet so we thought that surely by 2:30, the Sunday brunch crowd would have left this place...Nope, we had to wait (not for long thank goodnedss) and the rest was heaven.  I had the Isabelle which came with Avocado and Tomato - my two fave combinations ever. Mix that with poached eggs (the yolk could have been runnier...) and I devoured my dish in no time.  Service is smiley:)  Next time is to come here for drinks!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was definitely warm and friendly. I loved the decor. However, the only flaw is that it was a tad too dark for my eyes and a bit too noisy. My boyfriend and I had a hard time talking over other people. The set up was a bit crowded, if you were to go, make reservations near the windows! The server was sweetest. She served water fast and asked us how we were enjoying our meal.   The chicken linguine was superb. Extra cheese could be added (I may have added too much for myself, don't add too much!) My boyfriend had the baked mac&cheese. It was not as good as the linguine, not suggested! It was a tad plane.   All in all, loved it! Maybe come here sometime when it's not too busy."}
{"text":"Went for a late brunch with a friend around 2pm on Saturday. The place was pretty packed and we aited around 20 minutes. However, the servers were super nice and attentive while we waited, and this remained true throughout our time at the restaurant. We were given a quiet table in the back where we could talk comfortably. The atmosphere in the room was very lively and energetic, and there were lots of families enjoying their weekend together. Our server checked up on us occasionally, making sure everything was alright.   We ordered the Eggs Isabelle, the Traditional, and a coke. The food was honestly super delicious. There was a large variety of food on the plates, from eggs to fries to vegetables; their warm and crispy homefries were delightful!  Overall, a bit pricey, but the food was SO GOOD and the atmosphere was perfect for a casual brunch with your loved ones. I'd love to come back one day for dinner or to try the Heaven on Earth!"}
{"text":"Delicious drinks and food (oh my god, how many times did one of us say something about how good the crab cakes were?). The atmosphere in here is awesome, it's a fantastic lounge. The \"hipster\"-vibe is a little off-putting at first but seriously, it's worth it."}
{"text":"The best brunch place I've ever been in my entire life! Honestly.  This brunch restaurant beats Berkeley, SF, and LA so far! Most of the plates are $11-14 but the amount of food you get is tremendous and the quality is superb! I've tried their omellette which was really filling and it wasn't oily, but filled with fresh vegetables and a lot of cheese. The side salad is tasty, and the best part are their home fries! The home fries weren't greasy and it was caramelized and sweet and it just melted in your mouth. I've also tried Heaven on Earth, which is their French Toast and this place is a dessert on its own. The French Toast is sandwiched with honey, fresh blueberries, and a lot of cream cheese and it was so delicious.  I have also tried their Isabelle Benedict (tomato, avocado, mozzarella cheese) and it was so scrumptious, everything just melted in your mouth.  I also ordered the iced americano which was perfect with the brunch entrees.  They also have various mimosas and drinks! I will definitely come here again to try their waffles, pancakes, and everything else on their menu. I am always looking forward to brunch on the weekends at Insomnia.  The atmosphere is also very clean and the service was awesome!"}
{"text":"Yummy brunch date spot!  Food: 4/5 Simple but yummy menu Service: 4/5 Fast and friendly Environment: 4/5 Modern but busy Washrooms: 4/5 Okay Worth it?: 4/5 Current go to lunch spot  Came here for brunch. The menu is simple but super yummy. I had the pulled pork eggs benedict. It was super filling and very good.   The place is always packed and you may be elbow to elbow with the next person. This might not be the best place for an intimate conversation but fine for social mornings.   I will definitely be back here when I am in the area before noon! I should remember to make a reservation tho."}
{"text":"They have good mimosas (and cheap)! I like how long brunch is, until 3 I'm not sure if on all days I can't remember, but I came on a Tuesday. I had the green salad and it was really good, my friend had the grilled cheese and that one was kinda ordinary. Overall loved the atmosphere and really friendly servers!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!! This place has the best brunch food selections and decent pricing! There was so much to choose from so I got a biscuit with bacon and potatoes lol and there were $5 mimosas in 5 different flavors. I thought the decor was beautiful and they played great throwback music! If I'm ever in Toronto, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Sooooo, for my first Yelp review in months, I decided to choose Insomnia on Bloor West.  I went there after work this afternoon to meet with an old friend. We just wanted an ap to share, so we got the loaded nachos! And loaded they were. A mountain of lovely hot nacho chips covered with cheese, peppers and salsa. Included were side dishes of sour cream and guacamole!  Delicious!!  I'd love to go back and try some of the other dishes, because honestly, great atmosphere and friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"I love this place. Atmosphere is amazing, decor is on point, staff is super friendly and food is great. What sucks is that it's downtown (parking!) and the wait can be long during brunch.  Came by for brunch on a weekend and got their omelette and it was delicious! Super fluffy perfectly cooked eggs and cheese inside.  I would definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a busy Saturday morning - really thankful I made a reservation in advance or we wouldn't have been able to get a table.  It was my first time having eggs benedict (I've always avoided it because I tend to not like yolk) but I was pleasantly surprised and loved it. We shared an order of the St. Alban's and the Charlotte (smoked salmon). Their home fries are also really good. Very generous serving - I was stuffed full afterwards.  The only downside was we felt our server was a little inattentive - but otherwise food was great and I'd come back again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for drinks, and it was really good!!  We tried most of their signature cocktails on their menu, but didn't try any of the food.  My favourite drink was the Nice Up, but my least favourite was the Pura Vida (and I ended up sending it back and asking for a nice up instead).  The atmosphere was nice, and the decor is pretty nice too."}
{"text":"I came here to try their Summerlicious dinner menu and originally chose it for their vegan options! I appreciated that they had vegan options for all 3 courses (which most Summerlicious menus offer vegetarian but not vegan). The place is very cute with dim lights and wooden decor.   I tried their cauliflower taco, vegan shepherds pie and chocolate sorbet. To be honest, the only thing I enjoyed was the main course. I found the cauliflower taco very dry and the cauliflower was crumbly. The sorbet was vegan so it felt like eating chocolate and ice, but I appreciate that they had that available. The shepherds pie was the highlight of the meal. It was very very filling with potatoes, mushrooms and lentil (the last two subbed for the meat). Even though there was no meat in the dish, the lentils and mushroom added enough flavour so it didn't feel like it was missing.  The service was standard, nothing that stood out but not bad at all. Overall, I would probably visit Insomnia again. The prices on their menu are reasonable and many offerings seem very unique. 3 stars because I felt that it wasn't very worth it for Summerlicious (since I didn't like the appetizer or dessert) but I'm glad I got to try it!"}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious and got hooked. Amazing and relaxed ambiance and the food was great. Make sure you try the home fries with BBQ sauce. I am not lying - WILL BECOME COMPLETELY ADDICTED."}
{"text":"I've lived in the Annex for a while now and have only managed to try Insomnia just this summer. I don't know why it took me so long! Loved their brunch! Cheap mimosas and amazing food. Get the potatoes! These babies are so good they're like crack potatoes! I would definitely recommend Insomnia for brunch. I haven't been there for dinner but I can assure you it is one of the best brunch spots in the Annex."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots in Annex. They have amazing pastas and salads, and the brunch I hear is to die for."}
{"text":"This place has such a cute intimate vibe so good for a date. Perfect for brunch, dinner or late night drinks! I've never not liked something I ordered here. The huevos rancheros are really good. And I'm OBSESSED with their coffee it's my favourite in the city they put a bit of cinnamon in :)"}
{"text":"Was out Saturday night on Bloor and Bathurst looking for a place to have a drink and a bite to eat. Peeked inside Insomnia and in we go. Loved it, food excellent and drinks very reasonable. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Drove 45 minutes to get here and it was well worth! Eggs bennies were delicious - the pulled pork and salmon was sooo good! Eggs were perfectly soft poached. The fries were amazing, crispy and tasty. The chicken & waffles were also perfection! The syrup was so good too, not sure what ingredients were in it but it was addicting. Chicken was juicy and crispy. Overall very good experience, service was fast and friendly. Would recommend! Probably need to book reservations though, it's a very busy place especially on weekends."}
{"text":"Food was great, but it was overpriced. Ambience was boogie. Service was casual and cool. The brunch food (eggs dishes) featured delicious home fries and spicy sausage."}
{"text":"Ordered the Memphis and Charlotte for brunch, Memphis was really good with the pulled pork really flavorful, the Charlotte with smoke salmon Is really good too, beware of the long lines for sat sun brunches as this place is super popular. A good tip is to go for the seats at the bar because it's not too uncomfortable and much faster at times then waiting for tables"}
{"text":"Have been to Insomnia a few times now and have never been disappointed.  Whether it's dropping in for a late night drink, for a cup of cinnamon flavored coffee, or for one of the best Brunches in the city - I always leave satisfied and ready to recommend this place to friends!    The interior decor is also a plus at Insomnia.  It's pleasant on the eyes and very inviting as they post up artwork from local artists and rotate the pieces on a monthly basis.  It's almost a guarantee that you will talk about the artwork during your meal!  The back end of the cafe is my favorite - comfy seating and a great set of sofa's that make you never want to get up and leave.  But what about the food?  I've only had brunch here - but boy was it fantastic.  I know some people that look forward to weekends just so that they can come to Insomnia for their brunch.  Eggs are great and the potato's have a unique flavor to them that makes you come back for more."}
{"text":"Went for a fairly early breakfest, was very impressed with the selection of breakfest items. We were given a table by the window and the service couldn't have been friendlier. Had the waffles with bananas and strawberries which were devine. My mother had and omelet of some kind; unfortunately I don't remember which specifically, which she also thought was delicious.  Come early to beat the late brunch crowd, otherwise you'll be waiting a while as this place is incredibly popular, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"Bar idéal pour prendre un verre si vous avez réservé au Guu Sakabar juste en face et qu'ils vous annoncent 45 min d'attente. Petit et cozy, typique bar de quartier à 2 pas de bathurst station.  Great bar to have a drink when you are on the waiting list to have a table at the Guu Sakabar just on the other side of the street. Small and cozy, this bar reflects the atmosphere of the bathurst area."}
{"text":"I was feeling super hungry the other day but was way too lazy to cook anything yummy, you know how that is. So I went for a walk with my boyfriend and we decided to try out Insomnia.   I have been here before for beers with friends but I've never went there for lunch so I wanted to try it out.    We both got the chicken avocado sammy and then we shared a side of fries. Over all the food was really good! The sandwiches were open faced and I don't think I was expecting that but It was so tasty so not having the other half of the bread didn't bother me too much. Also it didn't break the bank which was a huge plus, it was around $22 in total for both of us. I went in starving and came out pleasantly full, so what more could a girl ask for?   Gotta try one of their cocktails next time. Spiked warm apple cider? Yes please!"}
{"text":"Went here for summerlicious. Overall experience was good. Got the tacos which were pleasant but the real showstopper was the fried chicken and waffles. This entrée was amazing!!! The dessert I got was the marshmallow smore and it was good as well."}
{"text":"this place is an absolute standby.  the atmosphere is nice, the mood is right, and if you're very lucky you'll be waited on by Roberta.  Burgers and fries are always fantastic and the cocktail options are great when I am hosting my brother who is all fancy about his liquor."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for their Winterlicious menu and definitely was not disappointed! Sat at the back on the sofas which was nice a cozy. I had the curried tofu tacos which were alright, nothing special - I would probably try the chicken tacos if I were to go again. For the main I had the insomnia burger with a side salad - it was delish !! The patty was super juicy and i think the bun was a brioche bun which added a bit of sweetness to the burger which I loved! The dressing on the salad was light and tangy and was sooo good! Finished with the cutest slice of carrot cake.   Service was a little slow but our server was so good with refilling our jug of water :) I would def come back to try their brunch menu."}
{"text":"The good: Great food! I highly suggest making a reservation or you'll be waiting a while for a table. The atmosphere is cozy and even though they get packed early I didn't feel rushed to finish my food or leave after we were done. I ordered the eggs benny classic with strip bacon and it was cooked perfectly.   The bad: Our waiter was friendly, but slow. Also, if you're a mimosa lover, they don't start serving alcohol until 11AM."}
{"text":"Pros: - The environment of the restaurant had a bistro feel. It was extremely cozy for a rainy and cold day. - The presentation of the food was simply perfect.  - Mochaccino  was delicious for a cold day. - The service. Everyone was very nice and understanding. They were all working extremely hard.  - Bathroom was clean.   Cons: - Very busy (Make reservations before going)  - Eggs Benedict was okay. I couldn't really detect the hollandaise sauce.  Even without the hollandaise sauce, the eggs Benedict was excellent. I would ask to have tomatoes and avocado with the meal.  Additionally, the chef accompanied the meal with Brie. If you do not enjoy strong cheeses, I advise you to ask them to remove it from your order.  ------ Disclosure:  I may have had the flu, therefore, it may have impeded my senses for taste and smell."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch spot; very affordable mimosa prices and delicious bennies. Spent a morning birthday breakfast there, and the bartender even got one of the mimosas! The only thing I would caution against is the breakfast potatoes - they come coated in this ketchup-y sauce, so if you're not a fan of ketchup, you probably won't like them."}
{"text":"I dropped into Insomnia late-ish on a Saturday evening to have some drinks with friends. I was expecting just a bar, but it is also a restaurant- however they don't pressure you to order food if you're just there for drinks, which is nice.  Atmosphere is decent - because it's a bar/restaurant there's a nice bit of chatter going on (&the music isn't too loud) so you can enjoy your time with friends. Servers are very helpful and quite attentive.  I went in with the aim of getting a mojito, and much to my (happy) surprise they had a special on pitchers - great for our small group to share. It certainly wasn't the best or most authentic tasting mojito i'd ever had, but it still tasted okay and did the job for a reasonable price. They seem to have a pretty good rotation of drink offers, and not just for weekends.  Good to keep in mind as a late-night alternative to places that don't have seating, or if you want somewhere a little nicer/cosier than Future's (for example)."}
{"text":"One of my favourite brunch spots in the annex!"}
{"text":"Awesome love their brunch menu. Did you know there is an item that donates $1 to the local boys and girls club! Amazing initiative and the home fries and covered in a home made sauce."}
{"text":"I went to insomnia to celebrate my friend's birthday. The menu looked delicious from what I read but just a bit pricey. I had called ahead to book a reservation and mentioned to them that I will be bringing a cake and told me that that there will be a cake cutting fee of $15. I personally don't understand why restaurants even charge this even though you are willing to cut your own cake and provide your own plates. I think it's a bit stupid.   When we walked in we were seated immediately. The hostess was nice. When we got seated, we were asked what we would like to drink and later on what to eat. Our server was having her moments it seemed like it. Once we placed our order, I asked her if she can make an accommodation for my meal which was having the buns of my burger on the side. She immediately walked away from me. I guess she went to go tell the kitchen staff right away. But a simple yes sure, or no problem would have been nice.  We got our food and the food was delicious of course. When it came to the cake cutting, we asked some slices to be taken to go as some of the people at the party had to leave right away as they were in a rush for personal reasons. We waited for the cake to be cut, and it did take a while. I understand that there are other tables that need to be served as well but when someone is asking for their slice to go because they are in a rush, you should put their request as priority. One of the attendees at the party asked twice to get her slice to go and the same waitress that served us told her \"it's being cut\" and turned around, and walked away as she rolled her eyes. As server, part of your job is giving customer a good customer service ensuring they are satisfied with their visit. It came to a point where I wanted a glass of water and had to ask three different people at three different times   Because my server just disappeared for a good while.  When it came to paying our bills, they automatically charged us for 18% tip because we were a large group. I was not told that when I initially called in and made a reservation as this is what most restaurants in Toronto do.   In my opinion, I personally wouldn't tip my server.l that night but was forced to pay the amount. Overall the food was delicious and drinks were great but the customer service could be improved on.   Would I come back again? Yeah why not."}
{"text":"I went to Insomnia TWICE this weekend. OK, it was a long weekend, but STILL!  Insomnia is my go-to brunch place. Might have something to do with the fact that it's walking distance from my abode. Might have something to do with the summer berry pancake, or those delicious potatoes, or it might have to do with the fact that whenever I bring somone here they are always impressed.  Brought a friend who was in town from Ottawa on Saturday. We arrived early, (10am) and had our choice of seats. I ordered The Traditional, she had one of the benny's, and our meal was delivered within minutes. Special shout out to Kristine our server, who was friendly and fantastic!   Monday I shuffled (somewhat hungover) with two of my gentlemen friends in town from Calgary. Now we arrived at 11:30, had to wait a fair amount of time in line, and our order and our meal took a long time (we were obviously there during a rush time). That being said the male server was still really friendly, and we had our coffee and tea and cucumber water (much needed) to occupy us while we drolled over everyone's food.  Every time I leave insomnia people I bring enjoy it. That's worth a lot. I have a reputation to uphold! And then I'm home in 10 minutes. That's worth a lot too!  I've never been here for dinner, but I would definetly recommend this place for brunch!"}
{"text":"I've been here like 3 times, but I don't get why people like it so much.  Is the food good? Yes. But in a way... it's very generic.  The best I can say is \"you could do a lot worse.\""}
{"text":"Stepped into this place for a single glass of wine and stepped out vexed.   The bartenders overserved one of their regular lushes beside my friend & I who then wanted to fight us.   Avoid it, there are tons of respectable options in the area."}
{"text":"I had their shrimp linguine. It was delicious. Comes in large portion. I couldnt finish the whole thing. I would come back again. The place is more like a bar, dimly lit with couches."}
{"text":"I discovered this place and went on a Thursday evening to enjoy some martinis with a fellow Yelper. They have a great selection of drinks/martinis and a happy hour, so it was a great evening and the first time I tried chocolate Martini (and not the last one, yummy!!!).  I left Insomnia wanting to come back to have a brunch, so I did. I was not disappointed! Great ambience for a brunch, cool menu with lots of options, lots of tables available (it was extremely packed on Sunday morning but we were able to get a table inside anyway without a reservation), delicious food and friendly service. I decided to try the eggs Benedict with smoked salmon and they were delicious, the portion was huge - I ended up so full but it was so tasty. I had to finish everything on the plate!  Keep Insomnia in mind if you are looking for a place to have a nice brunch."}
{"text":"Ordered the eggs florentine with a cappuccino. Both were great on their own and the meal itself was quite filling. I wasn't too-too fond of the ketchup-potatoes, but overall the food was great. I would definitely like to come back again and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch spot! Great atmosphere and great food! Try to make a reservation ahead of time if you can or plan on waiting when you get here! I had the classic eggs Benedict and it was great. Comes with potatoes and salad. The potatoes are PHENOMENAL ! Very large portions too! I also shared the French roast with the table and super delicious. Definitely could've shared my \"meal\" too"}
{"text":"My second time here, the first time I left without ordering, it was a gut feeling to leave. Its clear they cater to the university crowd and so they should given their location. This second time I went because the reviews on yelp indicated they had a great burger. Unfortunately for me this was not the case. Too much bun and it looked lonely on the plate. For $9.00 they could have put some sort of garnish with it.  One of the not so good burgers for sure but I have had worse so maybe it was just an off night. I absolutely loved the waitress. Very pretty and the only waitress on duty and wow could she run this place and remain pleasant at the same time. While I enjoyed the service and charming waitress, this place is not for me.  I am very impressed that the management reached out to me to further understand my disappointment.The fact that after 18 years in business they are still concerned about a negative review is reason enough that you should give it a try and decide for yourself.    Not every restaurant is going to be good for everyone and this place just didn't cut it for me.  Does anyone else remember the Empire Dinner? Now that was a place that mastered the burger."}
{"text":"Went for brunch - but not really brunch because we went early to beat the INSANE crowd that formed not an hour after we got there so it was more like breakfast - with a friend and ho. lee. crap. I had the tofu scramble and it was magical. So damned tasty and the little tortilla it comes with is as adorable as it is useless, considering you won't have the patience to load up the scramble in it and instead will resort to inhaling the scramble without a moment's hesitation. The same goes for the crack coca - whoops! I mean the salad that was served on the site. Seriously, that ish was crazy good, and I couldn't figure out why. It's literally just plain mixed greens with a house dressing, but whatever that house dressing is, it's enough to have left me fantasizing about bathing in it.  Oh also, they had almond milk for my coffee, so. Major brownie points. Insomnia, I'm gonna be back for ya, baby."}
{"text":"Insomnia was already packed by 10am on a Sunday when my sister and I came for brunch. Luckily for us, we only waited a few minutes at the bar and then were quickly seated at the back. Service was quick but not overwhelming and the waitress was very thorough in explaining the daily specials.   We ordered \"Heaven on Earth\" (we read great reviews!) and a peameal bacon & pineapple grilled sandwich to share. We were really impressed by both dishes. \"Heaven on Earth\" had an extremely generous slab of cream cheese (5cm thick!) sandwiched between thick French toast and lots of berries and maple syrup. They definitely did not skimp on the ingredients! In fact, we had to set aside some of the cream cheese because it was too much! The peameal bacon & pineapple grilled sandwich was good. It had a Hawaiian pizza flavour to it, but what stood out about the dish was the side of home fries in their legendary sauce. My sister and I are not normally a potato fan but the legendary sauce was amazing. We managed to finish all the potatoes!  We had a wonderful experience at Insomnia. Despite being very busy, the food was exceptional and the service was very pleasant. Their prices are also very fair considering the portion and quality of their dishes, especially when compared to other brunch places in Toronto. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Insomnia (I've been wanting to try this place for a while now as I've heard good things)-I was not disappointed. I tried the Huevos Rancheros and it was tasty, but I especially loved the side potatoes it comes with-they were crispy and covered in this amazing sauce.  Gotta give a little shout out to the coffee here. I read a review that mentioned it was the best coffee in Toronto and I thought how good can this coffee really be. After trying it, I have to agree, their coffee is amazing.  The service was great too-our waitress was really attentive and was on the ball.  Definitely will be coming back here to try another item on the menu soon."}
{"text":"I'm going to sound like an old person here, because the food here isn't what it used to be. This restaurant used to be my absolute favourite, a regular go-to; I've been coming to insomnia regularly for the last 6-7 years (admittedly, the last time I went here was more than 8 months ago) and have loved their food (my usuals were the burger, the salmon pizza and the brunch - yummmmm). The last two times I went there, the quality of the food had definitely changed: drier burger patties, less toppings on the pizza... I'm sure this place is still great for the amazing cocktails that they have and the brunch.   I think I would still recommend here for the vibe (a great date night place and a fantastic brunch place!), cocktails and the brunch. I don't think I'm quite ready to break up with this place, so I might go back for brunch and maybe dinner. A huge maybe on the dinner."}
{"text":"Insomnia is absolutely an annex staple! The dinner is just as good as the brunch (they make a great burger). Brunch is a great experience- would not have discovered the joy of brewing coffee with cinnamon without them.  Highly recommended for good food, great atmosphere and amazingly friendly staff.  I've been here many times and have never been disappointed with the service.  If you're into comfy dining- see if you can get a seat in the big chairs at the back :) Perfect spot for snacks and a martini."}
{"text":"Definitely make a reservation if you are going for a brunch! Otherwise you could wait for hours! The service was outstanding. I asked one of them to help me with a proposal and he helped regardless of his busy work! Very thankful! Heaven on earth was such an indulgence. French toast filled with cream cheese n berries, how can it be not good? Only thing is that there could be more flavor to the French toast itself."}
{"text":"Opted for an earlier brunch/breakfast on a Sunday at 10 am (to beat the rush) and I'm happy to say insomnia met my expectations ! I did make a reservation at 10 am just incase (brunch reservations only go until 10 am before its first come first serve).   My friend and I both got Benedicts. My friend got the Lorraine Benedict with strip bacon and she thought it was really well done and we definitely didn't expect the portions to be so big.   I got the Charlotte Benedict with smoked salmon and it was quite delicious. The potatoes on the side were amazing !!   The decor was nice and they seated us at comfy sofa chairs but the table length was just right for the chairs.   I also checked in on Yelp and received a $10 off for purchase of $50 to use. So I recommend that if youre a larger group or go for dinner.   Overall would definitely come back to try their dinner menu !"}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch, lunch and late night dinner. All was good! Originally came in here because it was around 12PM and we were just looking for anywhere that was open- we were pleasantly surprised. Best kale salad I've ever had. Prices were good, selection was good, all of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals.   Brunch was good as well, the portions were nice and they had a good selection of both sweet and savory. Overall, I was impressed.   This has definitely become one of my go-to spots when I'm in the area... I've never had a bad experience. Service is nice, atmosphere is great, portions are good, prices are good, food is always tasty and above average.   Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, prices honest, cool atmosphere and VERY close to Lee's palace for pre or after show meals!!"}
{"text":"Great food, nice experience and excellent management!  I really appreciate the way Insomnia manages the restaurant.  It is pretty clear that they aim to better their customers experience.    I received a follow-up from the restaurant after posting  my review about how upset I was the last time I went there.  We say that sometimes people make mistakes but the important thing is how we handle it.  I came back again with my husband on the Valentine's Day.  Everything was excellent.  We had a wonderful time with delicious food and drinks. We made a reservation at 4pm. for dinner because we were afraid it would get too crowded at night.  I was right. It turned out that it got crowded very fast.  Now let's talk about yummy things.  Drinks: Blush mojito ($12), Cask-aged Manhattan ($12).  I like blush mojito.  However I hope they will have muddled mint next time (I think I mentioned it last review too.  I really like muddled mint).  It tastes better with muddled fresh mint with rum.   Manhattan was very strong in my opinion. I think guys like it.   Starters: Mixed Green & Root vegetable salad ($6), 3/4 lb. Mussels ($13)  These dishes are the must!  They are my favourites now.  I personally don't like to order green salad in any restaurant because  they are usually all the same.  However, I have to change my mind.  A simple green salad could turn to be something that made my day.  The salad dressing went well with the green vegetables.  Red beets were very tasty and tasted much better when you chewed it with dried cranberries. Mussels in white wine and cream; was a perfect dish with side bread.  It was 3/4 lb. but it looked huge to me.  I had mussels here before but this time was the best!  I'm not sure if the time is an issue.  The last couple of times that I had mussels here, it was almost late night (I ordered before the last call for dinner).  Let's get back to the current moment.  Creamy white sauce is my favourite sauce.  I like mussels in white wine & creamy sauce more than mussels in other sauces e.g. tomato sauce, curry sauce, garlic butter, spicy sauce, and beer.  They were in perfect sizes and not too tough to chew.  It tasted a bit salty but not too salty.   It was blended well with the mussels.  It was a big dish and could be your main dish!  It was hard for me to finish it.  But I almost finished all sauce in the bowl! I will have it as a main dish and will add on side frites with horseradish aioli next time.    Main dishes: Wild mushroom & Lentil Shepherd pie ($18), 10oz AAA NY Striploin Steak ($23)  I like fish and was about to order the Salmon dish.  However, I wanted to try something different.  I ordered the Shepherd pie with King oyster mushroom.  I really the smell of the sauce in the pie.  It smelled and tasted like Worcestershire sauce..and something!? It was great though.  I was glad I ordered it. They did a great job for medium rare steak.  However, it wasn't at a good temperature.  They finished it before we were done our starters.  We were very deep in conversation that day.  They took them back and  kept them for a while in the kitchen.  My husband got it 10 minutes after they served it first time.  It wasn't their fault because it was hard to estimate our eating time.  But we' d prefer to have our food warm anyway.  My husband said it was still great and would be more wonderful if he could have it right away after it was done.  Maybe next time, we will mention it when we are ordering it.  Anyway, I had a new one for me ( I took time to finish my starter longer than my husband).  Thanks to Liana for offering an new one.  Dessert:  S'more with Burnt Marshmallow Ice Cream ($7), Creme Brûlée ($7)  I wasn't a fan of S'more or Creme Brûlée.  They were ok but I'd prefer Climax Cake. I will stick with my cake next time.  Overall it was fantastic, I was glad I came back again.  And I will be back soon!  Summer is coming!!!"}
{"text":"Very bad brunch experience. I booked table at 9am because on weekend they only accept booking from 9-10. They called me in the morning that they have power outage and cannot open on time. Later on they said the power was resumed and they will open at 10, which was fine and i can understand power outage is out of their control. So i still went.  However what they didn't tell me is that Kitchen won't open until 10.30. I was told upon arrival and even i waited patiently till 10.30. They still refuse take my order and just asked me to wait whenever i called for service. While i see other tables have been served for food, and I could NOT even order at all. And I waited another half an hour and finally there's waitress come and serve us.   I woke up at 8 in order to be punctual, but in the end, i was unable to order till 11am. Despite how starving i was, My following schedule has been ruined and i could have just cancelled and went to another restaurant, if they told me kitchen wont be opened until 10.30 in the very beginning.  Btw, just to add on, food itself is good, but half of reason could be i was so starving when the food arrived."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and my waitress was extremely passionate. I had the lavender chicken which was amazing. The chicken and waffle was better than other stores as well! Definitely will visit again and again and again!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised w how well they handled the brunch crowd and the wait wasn't long at all! The food was absolutely amazing and the 5 dollar cocktails were a great deal. Our server was awesome and was always happy to answer our questions and take the time to explain the Menue to us. Price is fair for the amount of food you get. The location is very convenient near the Bathurst subway. I will definitely return. Beware brunch on weekend can be a long line which is typical for any brunch spot. The atmosphere is very cozy with nice comfy sofa chairs to sit on and admire the lovely artwork on the walls. Easily one of my new fave brunch spots in the city."}
{"text":"Been here over 4 times and always consistent experience.  Great service, quick, delicious menu, nice décor and prices are reasonable for brunch.  Best home fries I have ever had.  Coffee is amazing too.  So glad we discovered this place!  Minor peeve - will only seat full party even though there are empty tables (even if it's only for 2 people). Fully get why restaurants do that but when there are multiple empty 2 seaters, is it THAT big of an inconvenience to seat the 1 person first?"}
{"text":"Make reservations ahead of time for this downtown brunch gem! I've been here twice now and I've had a great experience every time. The meals are hearty, filling and delicious. There are good vegetarian options too! The place is a small and is usually always busy. The back has some comfy couches with tables and the front is more bistro style. Definitely a cozy place for brunch with the fam and friends or a date.   The bennies are by far my favourite and they come with a heaping serving of fries."}
{"text":"Another fantastic experience at Insomnia. My friend, whose birthday we were celebrating, was craving a lychee martini, or two, so I suggested Insomnia for pre-dinner drinks. We had a blast here, and I got to try some new cocktails along with the Undone Darling (thanks for the suggestion Daniel!). The staff here are very knowledgeable about the cocktails they offer, and are more than happy to answer any questions you have. In terms of price point, you're looking at $9-$15 for their martinis and cocktails, but I believe they have $5-$6 martinis on Thursdays starting at 11AM (it's 6pm somewhere, right?). Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"The ambience of the restaurant when we first walked in is dim-lighted and lively, it was pretty romantic due to its interior design and table top decorations.  We were greeted by a SUPER friendly energetic female staff which possessed an extremely positive attitude (her name might've been Berta or Elberta).  I ordered the seafood linguini, and it was decent to good, not extraordinary; the alcohol cocktail I ordered was recommended well by the same friendly staff and it paired well with my entree. We ordered the sponge cake for dessert, and it was delicious!  I couldn't stop eating the cake and eventually the plate was spotless and not even a crumb was in sight.  I would just like to thank this restaurant for carrying out my special request that I have made while making reservations on the phone earlier that day!  The staff knew that it was a special night for both my friend and I, so she gave us 2 shots of the most mouth-watering peach flavored alcoholic drink on the house!  At the end, I tipped a lot more than I should because they definitely made my night!  Thanks Berta/Elberta! :D"}
{"text":"Insomnia is my favourite spot in Toronto for martinis! The list is extensive, the prices are great and I've spent many nights nursing drinks here over the past 10 years. This is a fab spot for a first date. The loungey area at the back is perfect for relaxing conversation, and equally befitting for a girl's night. Sitting at the bar is also fun-- I love the eyeballs and there's always great music playing. Decor is modern but not clubby and the twinkly lights on the ceiling never fail to increase my joy and make me feel like it's Christmas or something.  I love this bar so much that I'll only take off 1 star for the food and the service--which I think are both a little lacking.  I find all the servers as well as the bartenders here to be really indifferent, despite attempts to start conversation ( I know they can be busy). Even on slow nights I find they're not really friendly or responsive. I suppose it depends who's serving you. But for how often I come here, I've never had exceptional service. Maybe I'm just too drunk and annoying. Maybe I'm \"Oh no... not THAT chick\" to the servers. But I always tip well-- so that theory makes no sense.  The food is definitely not my favourite. If I'm planning on coming here for a girl's night, I'll suggest that we have an early dinner elsewhere and then head over for drinks. The pizzas are really doughy and I can never find the right combination of toppings for my palate-- and too many of them have sundried tomato-- come on, guys (It's 2013 not 1989). I find the mains a little uninspired. The starters can be okay, but on more than one occasion, the calamari has left me feeling funny. This may not be their fault as sometimes I have this issue with calamari, but it seems to happen here more frequently, so it's a toss up for me. If you're a foodie, you won't be happy eating here-- the flavour balances are not there and honestly...  I always feel a little ripped off because I cook better food at home. I think their menu concept is that non-committal- bistro- cater- to- all- palates sort of food.  These two things aside, I think Insomnia is a fabulous place for drinks and I would highly recommend it to to friends, co-workers, out of towners or anyone who's looking to quaff some tasty drinks of the martini persuasion. I think with a huge menu overhaul Insomnia could be even more amazing and probably turn a better profit, but then it might ruin the great scene that is deliciously neither douche, nor hipster. There aren't many gin joints that can brag about that!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE. Love the service, love the menu, love the atmosphere, love the hint of cinnamon in the coffee. Love it all!  We dined for brunch and ordered the special (omelet with goat cheese and swish chard), huevos rancheros and heaven on Earth. Everyone was pleased with the portions, presentation, quality and taste of food. Glasses were always full and smiles were just flying around. Only criticism I could make was that my omelet was lacking much swiss chard.  I look forward to dining again for brunch and trying it out for dinner."}
{"text":"Insomnia cafe is a cool place to chill out to socialize and grab drinks and food. I had reservations for dinner and it was busy, but I got seated with no problems. I ordered drinks and a mediterranean platter & bruschetta, it was great. For a main I had the chefs special which was a roasted chicken with some sides and also ordered spicy tomato penne. For dessert I had something good but I dont remember since I had a lychee martini & couple of cosmopolitans :)"}
{"text":"I live for brunch and I am so happy to have found Insomnia. This is hands down one of the best brunch experiences I've ever had. Price wise it is much cheaper than other brunch places and the portions were ENORMOUS. What's better? Their mimosas were only $5!  I don't recommend coming with a huge group because I don't think they accept reservations for brunch time. I came with a friend and we were seated quickly, but try to come early so you don't wait.   I really like how Insomnia has a wide variety of brunch items, ranging from eggs benedicts to savoury and sweet items. They also have a wide variety of vegetarian options! My friend and I opted for the benedicts because our mouths watered every time a waiter carried one out form the kitchen. I had the Isabelle which had just avocado and tomato. I loved how there was huge slices of avocados and it was just heaven. The dish was only $13 + tax and the portion size was huge. It comes with their homefries in the legendary sauce, but I think their legendary sauce is just ketchup. Also, there was mixed greens on the side with some slices of fruit. My friend ordered the Memphis which was the pulled pork. I really like how the hollandaise sauce was light and not too rich.  10/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"Food: 7/10 -- Value: 6/10 -- Service: 6.5/10 -- Ambiance/Décor: 10/10  \"I don't like dark chocolate and I don't like espresso, so I won't be climaxing tonight,\" said my friend after reading the dessert menu. Climax Cake. Dark chocolate and espresso.   The food ranges from alright to pretty good, but the prices were not great and a recurring theme was \"too dry; not enough sauce.\" We were grateful for the $10 off $50 offer on the Yelp phone app though!  Fried Chicken N' Waffles ($20) - This was too expensive for the quantity and quality. You get two pieces of chicken and half a waffle. Sure, it looks nice, but it had so little syrup and it wasn't so amazing that it warrants the price. It's half the portion size and more expensive than The Stockyards' FOUR-PIECE chicken and waffles ($16). Smaller/more expensive than Home of the Brave ($16) and Harlem Underground ($14). It tastes good, but I can't justify the price to ever come here for this particular dish.  Hand Cut Fries with Garlic Aioli ($6) - I mean, $6 for fries and garlic mayo (again, too little mayo; we were barely done half the bowl before we ran out), but what are you expecting from a Western downtown restaurant? They were good though!  Pork Schnitzel and Gnocchi ($23) - The pork schnitzel was really dry with sauce that maybe covered 1/8th of the it. Again, we asked for more. The whole dish was forgettable. It's a pretty simple dish, so the $23 price tag is puzzling. There was a single piece of bacon, which was really random and almost like it was added to \"add value\" and justify the price. Unlike the other things we ordered, not only was this not worth the price, it didn't taste great either.  S'More ($7) - This was probably the tastiest dish with chicken and waffles second. It really had a roasted marshmallow taste. It was small though. One graham cracker, one scoop of ice cream, and a few thin roasted somethings (caramel/marshmallow something?). It was tasty though.  The restaurant is really nice. Mood lighting that isn't too dark and the lights hung overhead really took the ambiance to the next level. The tables near the window seemed a bit cramped, but we were comfortable further in.  It's a nice space with decent food. I just wish the prices made more sense. I'm not sure I'd come back."}
{"text":"We had been aware of this restaurant for quite a while and finally got a chance to have a quick visit. It was Friday at 4:30 PM and we were going to see a film at the Bloor Street Cinema (right across the street) at 6 PM...so this was the night. Because we were so early in the day, the evening's specials were not yet ready. My initial thought would be that, if the restaurant is open for dinner, the specials should probably be available.  Here's my wife's breakdown of the chicken and waffles: \"Visually stunning presentation. The chicken was juicy and the waffles were crisp. But the chicken was very greasy. And it was served with a weird spicy maple BBQ sauce of some kind that didn't marry everything. It was just OK.\"  Here's my breakdown of the mac and cheese: \"Absolutely delicious.\"  We'd definitely recommend reservations as it's a very popular neighbourhood spot.  Frankly, neither of us was overwhelmed by Insomnia and, if we could, we'd have rated it between \"average\" and \"very good.\"  Would we go back? The answer is probably...but only to have the mac and cheese or try the specials."}
{"text":"So this was my second time coming to Insomnia! Just wanna try their brunch before 3pm!  We sat in the comfy sofa at around 1.50pm and ordered Charlotte, Heaven on Earth, black coffee and hot chocolate.  Hot chocolate and coffee came first. Disappointedly we didn't have the \"hot\" chocolate but a warm one, despite the fairly good glass that holds the chocolate. Black coffee is normal. Although there are just few tables of customers, the food came long after we finished the chocolate. So we also got a jar of water that came slow.   At first when I was yelping and saw the \"Heaven on Earth\" french toast photo, I thought the cheese inside was ice cream but no. So I then ordered a \"ice cream topping\" too for my french toast since I think ice cream with any french toast is the best combination ever for me!! And yes, this combination never goes wrong.  As I am not a cheese person (I can accept cheese like in grilled cheese), I think the thick cheese that stuffed in the french toast is too much for me. This would be a little reminder for some of you like me, to \"be careful\" of it haha. Stuffed Blueberries and strawberries are OK. One interesting note is that the french toast has a quite unique texture than most of the typical ones. The egg-like texture is soft and thick..with crispy corners of the bread. Perfect with maple syrup alone or the addition of ice cream.  The salmon egg benedict was great too. The side potatoes are like potato fries; they won't occupy much of your stomach but instead giving you a crispy outer layer and hot and soft potato crust. The salmon was fantastic and it makes me speechless. I wonder how they cook it. Muffin below reminded me of McDonalds' muffins. Eggs were well-cooked; they are like poached eggs. Good for those egg lovers!  Maybe because we went there late and finished our brunch late like 4pm, the waitress got us the bill once we finished our food. We didn't even have some time to rest or chat since she just came and asked us if we have anything to order, we said no and she said okay just the bill and she went to get us the bill right away. We felt weird or funny that why everything happened so fast lol haha. But all in all that was a quite good experience comparing to my last time late night dinner here. (If only the food came faster and we had more time to just stay, cos there were almost no one in there - or will they close before dinner hours?)"}
{"text":"Insomnia has been on my list of brunch spots for some time now and I'm so glad I finally made it! Came here on a Sunday morning and was seated right away. Hooray!  We ordered the memphis egg's benny and the sandwich special. I gobbled down my side of home fries right away - no joke about their secret sauce, it might not look that appetizing slathered over the fries, but it makes all the difference! Will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"Got there at 2pm on Saturday and there was a 45 min wait for the table. Just took a seat at the bar and ordered the $5 mimosa and ice tea. The bartender was really friendly and definitely took great care in preparing all the drink orders. We tried the special french toast with brie, short stack pancakes and mini eggs with home fries. The French Toast was amazing and the home fries were delicious. They ran out of pancakes so we tried the short stack and it didn't hit yjr spot but not bad for buckwheat vegan pancakes.  Great experience and service. Thanks Paul."}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch.   Love the potatoes. Big cubes with a bbq/ketchupy sauce. I could eat a whole bowl of the suckers. My brunch buddy, Gillian K found them a bit too rich. I haven't met anything rich that I didn't like.   Aside from the potatoes...other items about Insomnia that I love:  - the area - I feel an Annex list in my future  - they serve huevos  - the array of booze  - big ass bar stools  - friendly staff  - economical  - variety of patrons  - you get a large bottle of water, with lemon, at your table before you sit down  - funky art and photography on the wall  - they serve salad with brunch  - brown sugar at the table for your coffee/tea   Only reason I did not give Insomnia 5 stars is the tortilla for the huevos wasn't cooked/fried...a personal preference, I know.   I will be back to Insomnia for brunch soon. What a great spot!!"}
{"text":"We got here at 10.30a for Sunday brunch and were surprised that it wasn't very crowded, but 15 mins later- lines out the door. Wow  They wanted to seat us at the back of the lounge, which is great if you're having drinks, but not so much if you are stuck on a couch trying to eat b'fast on a sunny day- so we had to move us upfront near the windows/ entrance.   I had the Eggs Manami- eggs benedict on wheat-free rice patties flavored with curry with home fries.   Also had a side of sausage and we split the Chocolate Banana Pancakes for 'dessert' OK.  #1: The Home Fries are AMAZING. The best i've ever had in my brunch life- i'm pretty sure it was toasted/pan fried with a dash of BBQ and ketchup sauces. They were so flavorful and crunchy. Delish #2: The rice patties were so flavorful! Very tasty with the eggs which were done perfectly #3: The sausage was juicy and flavorful and substantial; i hate when restaurants stick you with small sausages and make you pay $3-5 for them.  #4: Pancakes: Thick and not what we were expecting at all. More like a dessert cake. It was good but a little doughy for me  The coffee also had a hint of cinnamon which was very yummy.   Overall, a really good and yummy experience; great service too. Definitely a great brunch spot in TO"}
{"text":"Tried this place during summerlicious. For the entrée, the Pulled Pork Taco was amazingly flavourful and saucy. For the main dish, I tried the Fried Chicken N' Waffles. The two fluffy Belgian waffle halves and two big pieces of fried chicken definitely filled me up. The service was excellent and accommodated a large group of 12."}
{"text":"Went back last night and am happy to report service as usual! Quick seating, good service - all on par with what I'm used to. :)   Ordered the Mac and cheese again (it's SO GOOD) and when ordering drinks, asked the server for a recommendation, she said she loved Beverly manhattans (think that's what it  was). I wasn't a fan (just personal preference) and she apologized even though it wasn't her fault at all! I'm just fussy. Replaced it with an amaretto sour (my go to) and she was kind enough to take it off the bill. :)   And, busy on a Monday night! Fun."}
{"text":"I went to Toronto over my birthday weekend and had a major hankering for the \"best\" brunch in the city. This place was top reviewed and so Insomnia it was. Let me say, this place did not disappoint; easily the best Eggs Benedict I have ever had. I got the kind with pulled pork (the name escapes me now) which was tender with just a slight bbq kick. The potatoes were almost equally delightful! They were smothered in a sort of homemade ketchup sauce that I will always long for but probably never find again. My boyfriend went with the stuffed french toast. It came with maple syrup, naturally, a very heavy smear of cream cheese and so many berries I wasn't sure how they managed to fit it all on the plate. Seriously, this french toast concoction was the size of my head! The coffee, too, was phenomenal. I think they add cinnamon when its roasted because for a black coffee it was very flavorful.   I would definitely recommend making a reservation, it was hopping by 10am on a Sunday! The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the staff was a bit short and there is no space whatsoever. I nearly dumped the entire table on the floor when I stood up (and I am not that clumsy a person)."}
{"text":"Just had brunch here, it is a Tuesday at 2.30pm so it is quiet (there are 2 other tables) we sit down and a server comes over and takes a drink order. The coffee here is great, it's a really nice taste and they are free refills.   I had the steak and eggs both of which were cooked perfectly, just how I ordered them. The home fries aren't my favourite and the house salad was pretty lame. My wife had the eggs Benny and really enjoyed them, she said they were done really well and she knows her eggs Benny.  The service wasn't bad, we only really had 3 interactions with the server, when he took the order 1. For drinks 2. For food and 3. When we got the cheque.  The bill was $40 for 2 coffees, eggs Benny and steak n eggs which isn't too bad I guess, although I've had better for less in the past. Altogether I had a good experience 7/10"}
{"text":"First time going there and thank god my bf made a reservation or else the wait would be forever! We started the meal with calamari and it was delicious!!! Crispy on the outside with light batter and still tender inside. The dip was amazing too.  I ordered chicken waffles for main abs my bf got the insomnia burger with fries. The fried chicken was so juicy and there's right amount of spice to balance the sweetness of the syrup. One thing I wish they could do is have the syrup on the side instead of pour on top. I enjoy the first couple bites but after half way through my waffle because super soggy and way too sweet. The burger was good but the fries was the best!  Super crispy just the way fries should be. Overall I like it and would go back again to try the brunch menu :)"}
{"text":"Cute first date place. Dimly but somewhat romantically lit. Yummy drinks - moderately priced. Sweet potato fries are good here. Service is ... Eh, okay.  Will be back to try different items and brunch - since it seems to be highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place, as always is exceptional! I've been to insomnia many times and have not been disappointed even once. I recently went back and had the Charlotte Benny (mission is to try all the Bennys on the menu) and it was delicious.   Again, I'm a fan of the cinnamon infused comment and savoury potato wedges at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last week for brunch and everything was very well done. The food was superb... i had no idea what to choose (i ended up going with my staple eggs bene), the service was extremely kind although a little slow ( nothing to do with the staff itself maybe a few more food runners would improv this) and the wait was not as long as I had thought. Definitely check it out !"}
{"text":"Came for dinner during Winterlicious 2017.  The place is not too small, but there's a lot of tables here and there so it might feel a bit tight. Lighting is dim, candles on the tables, coloured lighting along the walls.  If you're looking for the washrooms, you might start walking towards to the back cause it looks like there's nowhere else to go, but then you'll reach the end and just see the kitchen, and then turn your head and realize the entrance to the washroom was behind the wall near the entrance! Well, there's your excuse to explore the place. With camera in hand.  While I came for the winterlicious menu, most of the items are also on their regular menu, so I assume the experience will be similar on a regular night.  Out of the various tacos they offered, I decided to try the pulled pork taco. They really load the taco up to the point where it's quite a challenge to eat it without half of the toppings falling out the other side. It's a good taco though: great pulled pork, great tomatoes.  Next was the Fried Chicken n Waffles. I had seen a couple pictures of this work of art, but seeing it in front of me was a very different experience. It's basically two waffles and two pieces of fried chicken impaled by three skewers to keep it from falling apart. The fried chicken was quite something: crispy skin, tender juicy meat that really had that chicken flavour that you don't get from the BBQ chickens you can buy from Food Basics or Loblaws. They're just on a whole different level, which I suppose justifies the $20 price.  And of course, chocolate cake at the end. You can't go wrong with chocolate cake. Would definitely be interested in trying some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Quick Note: This Review is more like a 4.5 than just a 4. However as you already know, Yelp does not do half points.   Alright, let's get cracking! I have been coming to this place for at least 12 years and during the Summer back in '06, this was one of 'Mauricio's Certified Watering Holes.'  Which I haven't had many of... although, I guess you might get diverging answers whether you were to ask my friends or my liver.  Either way I digress, this place is a lot of fun, specifically if you come at night.   If you are looking for a chilled-beat-DJ'ed, slick and well alcohol stocked  lounge in the Annex, then without doubt Insomnia is the place to go. If you have a hot date, and you want to take her (or him) to a place that gives the impression you are in the know, then you can't go wrong taking them here. However, if your date is during the day or early, early evening, then avoid Insomnia like the crippling chronic condition it is named after.   During the day, Insomnia has a very cold and bare feel to it. The furniture is modern, unfortunately the wooden tables really seem washed out in this decor-combo but not as much as the floor which bares the weathered battle scars of servicing customers day in and day out for over a decade. The exposed brick walls lack personality in sunlight, even as the lonely looking art (from some unknown artists) try their best to decorate but are more likely just hoping to be noticed by an art lover and be purchased out of this generally empty place. As during the day, Insomnia feels more like a pretentious cave-like café than a lounge.     The menu is your typical Mediterranean/Fusion standard with some Humus/Salads/Calamari/Pizza/Pasta dishes. Honestly, I barely eat here as their selection although reasonably priced does not inspire me to order anything. Their brunch however brings quite a crowd each and every weekend with line-ups forming up outside at around 11:00ish. I have gone for their brunch a few times and although it was better than expected, it can get quite loud so it does not serve well for a quiet or romantic experience.  Quick note: As with most places in the Annex, their bathroom is located in the basement so it is not handicap friendly   Now where Insomnia really does shine is in its night-life. Their bar is well stocked and up to a few years ago it was one of the few lounges that carried a decent selection of say, grappa or different price points for vodka and single or blended scotches. They carry a reasonable martini and wine lists and some good selections of beers and ciders both on tap and by the bottle; plus a few liquors you normally do not find in your average lounge like Tequila Rose or Amarula.  The actual bar is lit from above by white Christmas lights creating a very vague simile of a night sky. There are tea-lights everywhere, giving the locale a sensual vibe which the shiny wooden accents from the furniture accentuate even further. In this light, the exposed brick walls exude a sophisticated loft aesthetic excellent for socializing and mingling. Insomnia is a like a chameleon.   I sometimes used to come here after a party for a nightcap and I generally and easily made new friends just by seating at the bar.     The staff was and is always friendly and if you have large groups the back has couches which can fit about 10 people. Although as I said before, Insomnia is more of date/small group (4 max.)  locale as it might be too loud for a group of 10 to hear each other or to mingle properly.   This is a great place for small groups of friends to spend a Friday/Saturday night or to bring a date for a few drinks and some fun conversation.   Fun Fact:  Whether they are ripping them off or trying to benefit by jumping on the mental condition bandwagon, guess what the Bar & Grill across the street from Insomnia is called? Ready for it? Amnesia!    ...Very subtle."}
{"text":"One word: potatoes. Oh, and brunch.  I love this place! Cozy little place in the Annex. Pretty central to a lot of things and just moments away from Yorkville. I've only ever been here for brunch and I've always left happy and satisfied, so I've yet to try the lunch and dinner menus.   Whenever I have brunch at Insomnia, I always get the traditional which basically has 2 eggs, toast, bacon, mixed greens, and THE POTATOES... not just any potatoes... they are THE POTATOES. omg. nom. They put some sauce on the potatoes which tastes like ketchup and bbq sauce and just yummy stuff all in one. I can eat these without ketchup, hands down. The great thing? That whole plate of goodness is ONLY $11 (and it looks legit... not like at your sketchy neighborhood diner).  To top it all off, I down like 3 of their sunrise mimosas because they are like heaven... and the best way to cure a hangover is just to keep on drinking (its a vicious cycle).  Service is always really great as well."}
{"text":"ironically, insomnia DOES close  nice place for anytime of day any day of the week.  i'm not a general fan of the overly loud music late at night when nobody is there..but hey..whatever."}
{"text":"Cute place, nice ambience, not enough of a cider selection- but lots of martini's."}
{"text":"I'll always love this place. The vibe is always nice, there's a good variety of cocktails to choose and there's free wifi if you just wanna go there and hangout during the day and work on your laptop. They have a pretty good brunch too!  The menu is getting a bit old though, they need to update and upgrade their cocktail list. They can use a new host as the last time I was there I didn't get a much friendly vibe from him, but the other staff has always been VERY amazing, super friendly and extra energetic.  I would never say no to a night at Insomnia.  I also have to add I've booked Insomnia at times for a meetup group I co-host for a professional women group, they have always been very accommodating in bookings and taking separate bills. So I would definitely recommend it for a group meetup as well.    And how often do you get a nice message from the business owner giving feedback to your review? to me this is dedicated customer service and constantly listening to the customers to improve. simply amazing."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since my days as a poor student. The great thing about this place is that the atmosphere is not compromised despite the reasonable prices. Have never been disappointed with the food - the burgers are delicious and the daily specials are worth trying.  Lots of good cocktails on the menu as well. The servers are friendlier than most in the city and I believe they usually have a DJ spinning on the weekends. A great date spot or for catching up with friends. Don't forget to try this place out for a hangover brunch either:)"}
{"text":"Location: Bloor St W Price: $$ Service: Thumbs up  It is one of the hidden gems around downtown Toronto. I say that it is a hidden gem because their logo is an eyeball and who would of thought how amazing this cafe would be.I went in by chance and it was worth the risk...  It is bigger than it looks and the food is amazing. The servers were friendly and very helpful. They have a wide range of food (breakfast-dinner and anything in between). My personal favourite is their brunch menu- affordable and delicious!  A must!"}
{"text":"I came here for an informal business meeting. We had our meeting on a couple of couches in the back, which was perfectly comfy and reasonably quiet. There's also free wifi, which is an absolute requirement for us. Our server was very patient with us, as we were there for a couple of hours, only ordering a couple of half-beers here and there. Big spenders we were not.  After the meeting, we had some eats. I had the avocado chicken sandwich with a side salad (sans cheese). It was absolutely delicious. I'm usually iffy about ordering chicken in restaurants, since they tend to overcook it, but the chicken breast was perfectly cooked.   It gets a bit dark later in the night for meetings (which may not be a problem now that i have a new laptop), but I definitely think I'll meet some of our cooler clients there again."}
{"text":"The food was great. The service was a bit slow but friendly. There are huge lines on the weekends so plan accordingly!"}
{"text":"Deciding to go to Insomnia for brunch on a Saturday at 11am means about a twenty minutes wait, but looking at all the reviews on here, I was determined.   We ordered the Heaven on Earth, the Today's Special Omelet with extra sausage, and the Charlotte (smoked salmon) Eggs Benedict. To drink, we had both the Sunrise Mimosa and the Morning Tea.  Service is slow, but that could be because it was a packed house. However, we saw our drinks sit at the bar for a full ten minutes before someone noticed them and took the one giant step to our table. Similarly, at the end of our visit, we saw our waiter wandering around filling other people's coffee after we asked for the bill (which didn't come for a full fifteen minutes).  We ordered strategically, one sweet dish to share and each ordered an egg-y dish. The sweet dish, the \"Heaven on Earth,\" was French Toast with a thick slab of cream cheese, with some blueberries and strawberries sprinkled in between. It was good, but definitely not to die for. The Today's Special Omelet came with a salad drenched I'm dressing and their home fries (which is really potato wedges) soaked in Bar-B-Q sauce. I tried two and that was enough - too much sauce made them soggy and was most certainly not today's special. The omelet itself was thick but all I could taste was the cheese, and nothing else. The Charlotte Eggs Benedict was pretty much a regular eggs benny with soggy and cold smoked salmon. It came with the same sides as the omelet.   Food-wise, it was ok - not completely bad and not great. I guess I was expecting the moon after reading the reviews on here but the omelet, the eggs benny and the french toast was nothing to die for. For that price though ($12-15), I don't think I'll be back... even with the $10 off (Yelp check in offer)."}
{"text":"Probably the worst food I've had at restaurant in Toronto (or anywhere else in the world for that matter) in years. The ambience was okay, but our mussels were nothing short of disgusting (not fresh, mostly unopened, and disgustingly slimy and undercooked), my girlfriend's salmon she said was the worst she's ever had, and my medium rare steak was tough and a horrible cut of meat.   I'm sure a 1/2 drunk 25 year old hipster who doesn't know better, you'll think it's alright. But otherwise, stay clear."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait! Have the house special it's huge and cheap $12.  Waffles and huevos rancheros were popular too. There's definitely a wait so the earlier the better! One of the most extensive drink menus I've seen in awhile. The bar was backed up though so that was a bummer."}
{"text":"What am I missing about this place? It's fine, but I don't get what the fuss is about. It's over priced, the coffees are teeny.  I have been there for brunch and it's really crowded but it's good. I like the vibe a lot.  However, the dinner menu: the food is fine, but it's nothing to write home about. The kitchen closes in the afternoon before dinner, though, which can be annoying on a weekend when your schedule is a bit off."}
{"text":"I've always looked forward to coming here for brunch so maybe I hyped it up too much because when I finally got the chance, I was only moderately amused. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing \"wrong\" about this place. The interior is modern yet classy, the staff are polite and smiley, and the food isn't bad. I just didn't think the food was spectacular. I've been to a few brunch places now and this restaurant is probably riding at the lower end of my scale.   I ordered the Charlotte Eggs Benedict, as usual, since it's my go-to brunch order, and I found the hollandaise sauce to be almost *too* creamy. It was very filling and made me a little queasy for a morning meal. Moreover, I was a bit put-off by the ketchup-lathered potatoes that came as a side. Normally I LOVE ketchup but this was just... odd tasting and the starchiness of the potatoes just made me feel more and more bloated.   My boyfriend ordered steak and eggs, as well as an iced coffee. His meal was mediocre but his drink was subpar - it was way too milk and barely enough coffee. On top of all this, we also ordered a french toast to share. It was supposedly infused with orange/citrus flavour but I couldn't really taste it. It was... just deep fried bread. I didn't see the appeal (maybe also because I was already super full from my meal and I couldn't even finish it)."}
{"text":"One thing I detest is bars that make you walk down a flight of stairs to get to the bathroom. When I'm in heels, combined with a couple drinks, I don't want to risk my neck just to go pee. The stairs that yoy have to go down here are steep and not fun halfway through the night. To drink, I got a Caesar which was quite spicy. Ask for a mild one if you don't want to choke. To eat, I ordered the veggie wrap which was mediocre. In concept the ingredients sound good but in reality it was just a lot of mouthfuls of plain kale.  I really wasn't pleased with the fact that the sandwiches (and everything else on the menu) don't come with a side dish. They have fries and salads on the menu on their own,  they really ought to put them together to make the meals complete. Since I went with a group, tip was included automatically in the bill. Because of this, I guess the waitress didn't think she had to try too hard. When two people switched seats she came over and gave attitude to them about how it messed things up. They assured her that they they only did it once and everyone would stay put from then on but she angrily told then not to switch anymore and walked away. Not very professional. The atmosphere was nice but that's really all they have going for them."}
{"text":"I have been in Toronto for at least a month, the food here in the city haven't been good enough for me to return a second time. However, Insomnia definitely been a memorable one. My friends are frequent visitors. Personally, I came here twice and it's been great food and good vibe.   The first time I came here was by chance, a friend of mine found the place on Yelp after reading the reviews, we decided to go here for Sunday brunch, a group of 5. Lucky us, we were seated almost immediately. My friends ordered the egg benedicts and omelettes. I wanted to be adventurous and ordered the \"Heaven on Earth\". Not denying the fact that it was absolutely delicious, it was diabetes waiting to happen. It was pretty much French Toast with berries, cream cheese, powdered sugar and MAPLE SYRUP! I also ordered a special smoothie and it was delicious, I was just overloaded with the sugar from the french toast.   I had some of my friend's home fries and it was probably the best home fries I had in my life. I would say my standards are pretty high given that my dad makes them at home. But these were amazing. It wasn't greasy or overpowered with seasoning. Inside, I wish I ordered something with home fries since they were so good! I was determined the next time to go again and get something with home fries.   Two weeks later, I found myself making that trip to Insomnia again, only with a group of 7 this time, whom all tasted Insomnia by now. The only problem I had with this was that I had to wait nearly an hour to be seated. I understand that it's a busy restaurant and there's only so much they could accommodate, I thought it'd be nice if the hostess could come up and check up on us. Honestly, at times during my wait, I was about to just eat somewhere else.   But getting back to the food, I ordered the Isabelle egg benedict but I also wanted the Florentine w/ mozzarella. Honestly, I didn't care too much about the egg benedict, the home fries was why I was back. My friend and I decided to split each one of the egg benedict so we got best of both worlds. Also again, I got the special smoothie, IT WAS AMAZING and I finished it rather quickly given that I'm a slow drinker.   The egg benedicts didn't wow me or anything. It was how an egg benedict supposed to taste like. I think I was too focused on my home fries which was amazing! I got to say I can't remember much from my meal minus the home fries.   In terms of pricing, this place might be considered pricey but it's worth the money for the food and atmosphere. I absolutely adore the decor of the place, extremely chic and modern but cozy. Definitely one of the best restaurants I had in Toronto :D"}
{"text":"The owner offered me $50 in gift certificates to come try it again.  Food was cold AGAIN, even though it wasn't busy when we ordered.  I didn't bother sending it back this time.  When it came time to pay, the waitress had to spend 20 minutes checking with the boss to see, as she didn't think we could use two $25 gift certificates together.  In the end they let us, and acted like it was a favour.  Even though it said nothing about \"can't be combined with other gift certificates\" on the actual certificate.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"We were so happy to find this restaurant through Yelp on our visit to Toronto! Liana took excellent care of us for brunch. The potatoes were amazing, and we couldn't stop eating them. We loved the Memphis Benedict with pulled pork as well. The portions are huge so sharing it definitely an option!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I moved into the Annex last June, and this has been my go-to brunch spot. Incredible eggs benedict and the tastiest sauce on the potatoes AND you get some greens too. They also have good lunch and dinner options and a wicked martini and real unique cocktail list."}
{"text":"One of my favourite brunch in town. Cozy with comfy couches, I love my Charlotte (salmon egg benedicte) and smoothie"}
{"text":"I live outside Canada and and when I come back to Toronto for visits there are two places where I have to eat.  Insomnia is on that short list.  I love the bottomless coffee and they never disappoint when it comes to the food.  I had the steak and eggs (again) and everything was cooked beautifully.  The steak was seasoned just right and the eggs were cooked as ordered.  The servers were friendly and made sure my coffee never ran out."}
{"text":"My motto is.. if it's cool they will come.. and come they do at this ultra cool lounge style restaurant cafe.. this place gives you the proper environment for good vibes and good times.. Bar staff is sexy.. waitstaff is sexy.. what more do you need.. Food you ask.. well that's sexy too.. LOL and good!! I have not tried one bad thing on the menu.. and this place has the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten.. ANYWHERE!! my order the other day for 3 pcs to go accounts for that.. it's called the CLIMAX Cake.. order this.. guaranteed to please!! and make you come back for more.. :)"}
{"text":"Im only writing this review because I  thought about their home fries and now I'm going to make a failed attempt at copying their recipe. Their food is so good, service amazing, and the wait was a little long but worth it considering we didn't have a reservation.  But their home fries are soooooo good! Literally the best home fries I've ever had... its months later and I'm still thinking about them."}
{"text":"Eggs were perfectly poached. The service was delightful. The restaurant itself is adorable. It did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"One of the city's best brunch spots. I've been coming here for years. You can't go wrong with the General's PLT, the Traditional, or, if it's a weekend, eggs Lorraine. Tip: their drip coffee is steeped with cinnamon and very satisfying, not the usual low-quality drip coffee that's often found at breakfast/brunch places."}
{"text":"I went to this place for brunch on Saturday afternoon after making reservations 1hr 30 min ahead of time. The wait time should prove just how popular this place is.  Even more so was how great the food was, portions and all!  I ordered a 3 egg omelette with mushrooms, spinach, and I can't remember what else, but it was fantastic. The potatoes taste brilliant and the toast is as you would expect toast.  The couches we sat on were nice, it gave it a fun vibe that was laid back and comfortable! The only thing was how hard it was to hear the people across from me, but I think that's a given, as it's a brunch place that everyone feels relaxed at.  Definitely going to come back!"}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork eggs benedict and it was delicious! The egg was runny and the pulled pork was so flavourful! It came with a side of salad and home fries that had this special sauce. The fries were the highlight of my meal haha whatever secret sauce they have, it tastes amazing! Great service and love how the place is decorated too! The only downside is it was quite expensive in my opinion and not exactly worth the $17.45 it cost."}
{"text":"Food was totally worth the wait - Brie and pear grilled cheese was amaaaazing.  I didn't stand in line for too long (10 min and they text you when your table is ready) but the service was slow in bringing you your food because it's so packed.  Would definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I was here for dinner with my boyfriend on New Years Eve. We were seated immediately at the back. I recommend getting reservations though for the nicer seats. great chill atmosphere and tons of drinks on the menu.   Food came quite quickly, I had the kale salad which tasted amazing! Great job to the chef, the kale didn't have that acrid taste but was soft and savoury. My boyfriend had a chicken burger in a milk bun which he loved, and said it wasn't something he's tasted before. The hand cut fries was also nice, however must be ordered separately."}
{"text":"Food took way too long for what we ordered... Over forty minutes for fried chicken and waffles, and a pasta dish with no meat in it. Server was inattentive to this fact and checked in on us infrequently."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and drink specials!  At night, the inside looks amazing. The tables have candles and I really like the lights above the bar!  I've been here twice now. In May, I tried one of their 10 after 10 specials. That night was calamari sliders with a beer for $10 after 10 pm. I didn't like the sauce it came with much, unfortunately, but it was good otherwise. There was a different special every night. Highly recommend for late night eats!  Most recently we came for drinks only. Caesars are on special for $5. Also, after 10 pm, certain beers and liquor are $4. Sounds like a good deal to me!  The waitress was very friendly and prompt. We didn't have to wait very long for service. And she noticed our empty glasses right when we finished and asked immediately if we wanted another drink. Perfect!  Excellent recommendation from my BFF. Hope I'll be back again to try out more of their food! Love their selection of deals! Maybe we will get their price fix next time - $25 for three course in August :) and judging from other reviews, brunch looks good too!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and ok dinners.  Pretty good cocktails.  Warning breakfast gets packed so go early"}
{"text":"Meh... not bad for a decently priced meal in the Annex. Decent food & overly sugary drinks. I wouldn't highly recommend this place, but there's nothing particularly wrong with it either!"}
{"text":"I was here again a few months ago, and my experience was unfortunately worse than my first.  Since my first wasn't amazing, this was pretty disappointing - everyone raves about the brunch here, but I'm sorry to say that I don't see why.  My friend and I arrived and were seated without too much of a wait (this friend doesn't agree with my \"arrive as early as possible\" philosophy).  We both ordered bennies, and when they arrived I started in on the potatoes - which were quite good actually.  However, my friend tried her benny and it was cold.  Which prompted me to try mine - also cold.  Really really cold.  The potatoes, confusingly, were perfect temperature.  Our meals were replaced, but even then the items weren't as hot as they should have been.   All in all, with so many brunch options, I'll try elsewhere next time someone wants to do brunch in the Annex."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were great, but the service was sub-par. They failed to pay attention to when another round of drinks was needed or when to clear the plates. I'd definitely go back for the food but I hope the service improves."}
{"text":"Such a cute place for brunch! We got there a little before 11am and were so glad we did because the line got long really quickly.   I ordered the pear grilled cheese (which came with a side salad and home fries) and sunrise mimosa - both were yummy. They didn't have challah bread so I opted for multi-grain for my pear grilled cheese. I was not a huge fan of the home fries but the side salad dressing was pretty good."}
{"text":"I've gone to Insomnia since it really started out as an Internet cafe/resto...then turned into a Fondue joint, and now it is mostly just restaurant.   I enjoy the ambiance.  Indeed, for the brunch lover - Saturdays and Sundays are rewarding.  You get seated, get your meal, and get out.  I haven't tried anything other than the Eggs Benedict at Brunch, and until they mess that up (never I hope), they make it the best in my opinion."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Insomnia, for the longest time (before I had been there) I always assumed it would not be right up my alley but having visited it on a few occasions in recent times, I have come to enjoy their great drink selection and their surprisingly good food options.  I assumed a place concentrating on drinks would not be a location I would come for with the primary focus being food but insomnia has turned in to a place where I come to expect good food along with their good drinks. I guess it's true to its word when proclaiming to be a \"restaurant and bar\".   Their prices are not dirt cheap or anything but definitely worth for the product you get and quantities are a good size as well. It can get a little crowded and their seating arrangement are not super comfortable with a large group (but on the plus side they do have the ability to accommodate a large group).  Their staff are always friendly and their manager Adam (I think) is ever present and very friendly himself, he also likes to integrate the place with location based social media and every time we've checked in using foursquare he's given us 15% off the entire bill! But I'm not sure if that's something he does as a rule."}
{"text":"Good selection of beer and bourbon.   Late night menu (the burger was awesome) and a GREAT cup of coffee is WAY better than a diner (which isn't around this hood anyway)"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance and decor. Dim lights with twinkly fairy lights above gives a very whimsical feeling. The restaurant also fills up very quickly, make a reservation ahead of time!   I visited on a Tuesday evening for dinner with a girlfriend. Of course we ordered wine to share. The drink menu is pretty pricey compared to other places I've been to, with their house wine coming to $40 for a 1/2 litre.   We both ordered the fried chicken thigh sandwich. The batter was delicious and crispy with beautifully tender and juicy chicken inside. I was missing sauce on my sandwich, I found that the large amount of bread made it dry. Such a shame for perfectly cooked fried chicken...   We split fries. The portion was huge and was accompanied by a phenomenal garlic aioli. The aioli is kick-ass garlicky, I'd advise you steer clear if you are on a date.  Overall, the food was great and wine was pricey. I'd come back to try their brunch or something else on the dinner menu."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and simple: Hands down the best brunch in the city! The oven baked pancakes and potatoes marinated in their mix of BBQ and Ketchup are a must. Friendly service and excellent value for money. No wonder they often have a one hour+ wait!"}
{"text":"Came to this place for Saturday brunch around noon and the line was super long!!! Good thing the girl who was in charge of the waitlist offered me and my friend to sit at the bar, so we ended up not having to wait. We were staving and the person working at the bar was really friendly and made me us some drinks right away. Me and my friend both ordered Pulled pork egg benedict and the pulled pork was the best I have ever had!!! Definitely recommending all of their Egg benedicts and I will be sure to come back to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Crab Cakes: Ask for extra sauce. The sauce is what makes this appetizer what it is. I've had better crab cakes but the sauce brings out the texture of the Cakes and I manage to run out of it fast.  Main: So this time around I tried the Fish Tacos. For a place that doesn't specialize in fish tacos .. I was pretty impressed! They definitely added a little more jalepenos and I asked for them to bring me extra sauce on the side. This was mix of all three of their hot sauces (chipotle mayo, jalapeño sauce and Tabasco).  Main: Sheppards pie seemed pretty bland after we ate the spicy tacos so  a word of advice to you all: Don't eat the the spicy tacos before the shepherds pie because the shepherds pie will feel like it has no taste however on it's own the shepherds pie is pretty decent and is a massive portion size.  We got dinner reservations for two at 10:30pm and we found the place to be packed. There was a line up and no spare tables. For people wanting to do a social gathering, there's a cute spot at the back with sofas and tables."}
{"text":"I am a horrible person for living around this bar for many years, and never giving it a go.    A couple of weeks before Christmas, I had my first Insomnia experience.  I met one of my close friends for some brunch and \"Christmas cheer\".  We met at 10:30, and there was already a big line.  Luckily the two of us were fine with sitting at the bar, and we seated right away.    First of all, LIFE CHANGING CEASAR!  I still have dreams about them.  I think I had three, and I'm not even embarrassed to admit it.  I had a classic eggs benny, and loved the home fries in the spicy sauce.  My friend had steak and eggs.  He's a very experienced chef, and he was impressed with the food and drinks as well.  Our bartender/server was AMAZING and after several cocktails, offered us each a shot on the house.  Now that's service!  I also went there again last night for a drink after a stressful day.  Once again lovely service.  I had the Toronto Sour (basically a bourbon sour... but way better than any you've ever had) which was also life changing.    I think I'll be heading there for brunch this weekend!  I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"Great location, great atmosphere and decent food, yet the service was a tad on the slow side and the pricing a bit steep. I can normally forgive slow service when a restaurant is packed but on this day nary a soul in sight. I wish that I could state with certainty that Insomnia will be a favourite haunt for months to come, as I live within spitting distance of its front doors, yet after my first visit this remains to be seen.   On the plus side. The home fries that accompanied my breakfast were incredible. They were real chunks of potato goodness slathered in house made BBQ sauce and perfectly cooked. My roommate recommended them highly and I must say that they more than lived up to any expectations I may have had.   I will concede that it may have been an off day at Insomnia, and although the prices was a bit high, they weren't astronomical and the food was definitely on the right side of the bell curve, so it will definitely warrant a future visit."}
{"text":"I've always heard about Insomnia Cafe and its good food. So when I saw that Hurrier offered delivery from there I was happy to order my dinner there. I ordered the garlic hummus with tortilla chips, the seafood marinara pasta, and a garden salad. The chips were good and the seafood marinara ok. But when I opened the salad I was shocked to find a bug in it. There was also no salad dressing included in the salad. I believe they forgot. I'll definitely think twice before ordering from insomnia again..."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday morning at 9am with a reservation. It was pretty empty but by the time we left at 10am a line was beginning to form at the entrance. The heaven on earth was really good, but was large so I had to take half of it home. The ice tea was American unsweetened style, which I didn't know until I tried it. I wouldn't order that again as it was bitter. My table found the home fries to be too saucy, we all would have preferred them to be sauce less or with the sauce on the side. The ambiance of the restaurant is very nice, and I would come back and try something else on their menu, for brunch or dinner. I wish they would allow for brunch reservations though, I would go here 5 times more often if I could reserve online as I hate waiting in lines."}
{"text":"Portion sizes are huge here! We shared the egg Benedict, French toast and their regular breakfast and loved every bite.  The waitress was even nice and offered us complimentary mimosas on the house, which was also very good!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite spot in Toronto for chicken n waffles. 3 of us went to Insomnia last night. I obviously got the chicken n waffles and my friends got tacos and shrimp linguine. My friend was really happy with her shrimp linguine. My boyfriend had the taco flight with pulled pork, chicken and roasted cauliflower tacos. He thought the meat was very flavorful but found the tacos a bit dry. He wasn't a fan of the roasted cauliflower taco so I ended up eating that and thought it was pretty good. I also had a lychee martini and thought it was delicious and not watered down. Also, it came with a lychee in the glass which is bonus point from me.  Overall it's one of my favourite spots because of the lighting and ambience. It's great for hanging out with friends or for a date night. Super cozy and I love the lounge area in the back with the couches. I have been here several times before and love their nachos."}
{"text":"This place is the bee's knee's! It's not located in the usual part of town and I love that because it's almost like a (not so secret) place that those who know about it visit. They have amazing food and an amazing aesthetic! Each and every time I've been here I've had great service and amazing food! I would definitely recommend the blush mojito, nachos, chicken and waffles and fried chicken burger!!! I recommend this place to my friends and will continue to come here again and again when I find myself in this part of town."}
{"text":"As per the recommendations, the brunch here is incredible. I had the insomnia burger (no, that's not brunch, I know), which comes sans-sides but is priced at a palatable $8. Friends had the salmon eggs Benny and pulled pork eggs Benny--both were scrumptious. Although, interestingly, the pulled pork was almost *too* flavourful.   Nonetheless, ingredients are fresh and the servings are entirely satisfactory. Service is standard. While nothing to write home about, it does the trick. There were many options on the brunch menu that will be pulling me back."}
{"text":"Amazing food, super cool place, friendly wait staff, fast service. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I love it here! I've been here for brunch twice and both times it was amazing! I came here for my birthday dinner as well and everybody loved it, I have some vegan friends as well so it worked out perfectly! For my birthday dinner it was a bit slow, but besides that an overall perfect evening"}
{"text":"Love the casual artsy atmosphere...super energetic and busy. Food was delicious. Brunch was on point...great experience!"}
{"text":"The best brunch place in Toronto! The St. Alban's classic is amazing and so are all the other benedicts. The cinnamon buckwheat short-stack is worth the 20 minute wait so you can get this as a dessert to share. The wait time is about 1 hour on weekends but no line on weekdays."}
{"text":"Yes, the wait times can suck but it's worth it! I've been here a couple of times and it was never disappointing. My last visit, I had their mac &cheese and it was amaaaazing! Absolutely delicious!   I haven't tried their brunch menu, but I hope to soon!"}
{"text":"So this place rocked my socks for brunch! Amazing food (eggs benny with some extra flare). The green salad and salad dressing with the benny was awesome. The potatoes were heaven, they have some sauce on them that life can almost not imagine. Breakfast cocktails were superb. So yes go eat here and the service will also blow you away."}
{"text":"Came this time for dinner and a drink. The menu indicates what's vegan which I appreciated. I tried their tofu taco and their veggie wrap. The tofu taco is delicious and a good option for those who are looking for a light snack with their drink. If you are hungry and looking for something that will fill you up then I highly recommend their veggie wrap. Its loaded and tastes amazing. Friendly service. Overall a great place, worth checking out"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch once and it was not bad but nothing memorable.   Came here another time for $4 drinks and that was great! Quick service and great drinks. Makes for a good time. I believe $4 drinks are every night but don't quote me on that."}
{"text":"Came in just before closing to have a couple $4 beers, tried to vote for their restaurant to get 10 bucks off my bill but the voting wouldn't work. The coolest manager in the world said \"I trust you, just do it later\" and did it anyway. Customer service like that gets my vote, five stars, and a Yelp review. Keep on being cool."}
{"text":"We went here in the evening looking through pictures on yelp. We were craving pancakes and crepes and waffles and cocktails lol so it looked like thats what they served. Only to find out those pictures were from brunch....duh. Anyways, they were able to get the chef to make us waffles with icecream even tho it wasnt on the menu... Best chicken and waffles ive ever had tho. The drink were a bit meh..pricey. Not a bad experience but it was seriously crowded and small.  We were sat next to a couple on their second date... I know this because they were literally sitting beside us and we could hear everything they were saying.... He def didnt get laid. Anyways with that being said.. It wasnt super awful because the food was good."}
{"text":"pretty good brunch, very dense so i'd recommend you share with a friend and split dessert after maybe. i got the eggs florentine on some curry bread thing which was good. i dont recommend the french toast though."}
{"text":"Must. Support. Favourite. Local. Restaurant.   After my previous review, I got a very kind message from the owner apologizing for the mixup and in return gave me a some gift certificates! I think this is an incredible gesture by the owner and much appreciated. We still haven't used that Groupon, but I have been back already once.   Brunch is always well priced and good food. No, they do not take reservations (unless at 10am or 2:30pm) but you can call ahead to put your name down for a table 30 mins before you want to arrive (highly recommended!)  This was also one of the only places that was open and serving brunch on Monday of a long weekend. How thoughtful!!  For the 4 of us, we got there and the next available table was ours.  A round of mimosa for everyone at $7 each. And the meal was around $10-12 a person!  Excellent eggs benedict, I can never pass it up.   The servers are friendly and smiley."}
{"text":"What is not to like! Thursday night in Insomnia  is cheap Martini night...mighty fine and you get a full size glass, none of this skimping on the measure (which I have experienced elsewhere).   My friends and I were pushed for time...I advised our waitress that we did not have long to eat.  This was not a problem and she quickly took our orders, and had our checks ready at the end. The service was outstanding, she gave us a round of shots as she knew we did not have time for dessert.   The food and Drinks:  $5.50 Martinis...yes please!! Delicious, if only I could remember the names of them, I had a coffee based Martini which was superb. I ate steak with garlic mash...perfectly cooked and the mash was very tasty. My friend had a grilled chicken and brie sandwich, it looked really good. I have been advised to try this place for brunch and I most certainly will as the menu looks good.  Atmosphere/Size etc:  Good sized, not to busy and the tables are not crushed together. The bar has a warm feeling and is quite dark, I liked it!  Will most definitely would return and I would most definitely recommend...a little gem at Bloor and Bathurst"}
{"text":"I went here for brunch not too long ago and was super impressed with the food! I love Insomnia's breakfast potatos - they have a sweet and sour sauce on them or something like it that is just so incredibly yummy!! The service here, as usual, is delightfully friendly. I'll keep coming back to Insomnia for the excellent martinis, delicious breakfast, fun atmosphere, and incredible service. Thanks for being an Annex staple!"}
{"text":"Got notified we (3 of us at one small table) have to leave within 15 min because there's a big group reservation coming and they need our table when we haven't even finished our food and drink. We asked if it's possible to move to another table and was told they couldn't find one. Overall the food is fine but there are too many people. My experience here so far was I either had to wait in line for a long time or got asked to leave with no apology offered."}
{"text":"About a year ago, 2 of my girlfriends and I suddenly got back into contact and started hanging out a lot more. Along with my best friend and my younger sister, the five of us decided to make it our mission to try new places to eat in Toronto. Our first \"event\" was my friend's birthday. She asked me to find a bar-type restaurant where we could have dinner AND drinks too.   I looked up reviews and websites; we wanted a good get-toable location as well as fairly cheap drinks. Insomnia was actually the first place I suggested to her and after a look at the site, she agreed to try it out.   1st time: Food+Drinks - Great; Service -- Awesome I called to make reservations - the person who picked up was efficient. Not super friendly, but very efficient. When we arrived, everything went according to plan. Our server was great. Our food was great and the drinks were great too :)  What made the night special for us was how our server was so sweet to the birthday girl and made sure she was happy. That is true dedication and it really made us want to come again.  2nd time: Food+Drinks -- OMG. Service -- Fantastic A few months later, I was asked to organize another event - a going away party- for another friend. We went to Snakes and Lattes for board games and afterwards, they all wanted to eat real food and have some drinks, I immediately suggested Insomnia again. There were no reservations this time because it was so last minute but when we got there, the group got split up. My friend and I decided to go in first anyway and we were seated right away. Our server was different this time but super fantastic. She introduced us to the menu and even gave us suggestions/told us the specials. We couldn't decide but then we saw the table next to us having mac and cheese. Our server winked and said it was amazing and holy wow. It really was.   3rd time: Food+Drinks -- Chocolate. Service -- meh In March we came here for dessert after going out for sushi down the street. We ordered the Lindt Icecream? OMG. it was heavenly! Our server was a different person again. This time she wasn't that enthused to be serving us though. She would act very impatient but in a melancholy way haha so were like, oh uhm maybe she's just having a bad day...but then when she turned to go back to the bar for something, she had an animated conversation with her coworker so we were obviously unimpressed with her attitude towards us for the rest of the night. We did order some drinks too, but in the end, we just had very little and left. We were seated in the back on the couches this time (first time for us back here) and while it was quiet and private, it was a little cramped and perhaps that was the reason our server didn't want to come to us very often hahaha.  4th time and beyond: THIS IS THE REASON WHY WE STILL COME AND RECOMMEND THIS PLACE FOREVER  In May, they had this waffle burger thing. OMG. who comes up with these ideas???? Yah, we started following on Facebook because we wanted to know what dishes were coming up. (Esp the mac and cheese. we wanted more mac and cheese) And lo and behold, the May special was that waffle burger thing and a side of mac and cheese. We were SO there.   My sister had gotten groupons for this outing and since these were one of the first groupons we'd ever purchased, we were a little worried that we'd be treated differently because you know, coupons sometimes make employees feel like they \"don't have to be nice because it's not full-price\". Thankfully we were welcomed by our favourite server from the 2nd time (we've been served by her every time after the 4th time until now too :D so happy lol)  She was so awesome about the groupon and was patient while we chose what we'd eat. She recommended drinks and told us how everything tasted; her favourites and whatnot. She even asked us if we wanted separate bills; this is something that we like because it shows that she wasn't assuming anything and that she was a person who thought ahead. She even went to find out about the World Cup for us because we missed the game. Honestly though, I think we come back mainly because of her. I mean, the mac and cheese is amazing (we're coming back in about 2 weeks since it's back up as a special LOL) but if the service sucked, to hell with the food, we wouldn't wanna come back and be treated like it was a pain to serve us. Our server makes each of our visits enjoyable; coupled with the great food, it's an overall great experience!   LOVE IT. Y'ALL SHOULD COME HERE =)  ps: i dont know if the attire is dressy or not, but us girls dress up when we come so i'm gonna put dressy :P"}
{"text":"I came back to Insomnia for dinner and drinks with a friend and we were not disappointed.   The food was very delicious to the point where my friend was eating every leftover crumb possible from his plate since he found it very delicious.  The Hummus with Tortilla Chips was prepared nicely as the heated tortilla chips nicely complemented the rich hummus.   The Insomnia Burger was a nice compliment to the beer I had. The burger was cooked to a perfect Medium temperature, while the Garlic Aioli provided a harmonious combination with the beef and the cheese.   But , once again, the Hand Cut Fries with Garlic Aioli were the best. My friend and I would have preferred the fries to have been crispier, but they were still hot and fresh to be dipped in the Garlic Aioli on the side. My friend enjoyed the Garlic Aioli so much that he even licked the whole spoon cleaned.   The service was very good as our waitress was very friendly and approachable. She made the evening a lot more enjoyable with her friendly attitude and presence.   I was very happy with the quality of the food and service I received and I cannot wait to be back soon for another meal with my friends and I definitely cannot wait to try the Brunch items eventually."}
{"text":"Checked out Insomnia this past Sun for brunch. Heard good things from fellow Yelpers, so perhaps my expectations were too high...  My meal (eggs Isabelle) would've been good had it been warmer than the temp in the room! Hollandaise sauce on my poached eggs was meh. Potatoes were good, but a bit overly drenched in BBQ sauce. Service was lacking in attentiveness and friendliness. Atmosphere was too loud for meaningful conversation.   Overall, I'm less than impressed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Writing this review on behalf of my wife as she does not have a yelp account. She visited insomnia with her friends sometime a week ago and she ordered the Memphis. She said the pulled pork was fresh and the eggs were well made."}
{"text":"It is a pretty small place, and does get quite busy, but I always really enjoy going to Insomnia. I love the drinks, the atmosphere, and the food (the mac and cheese here is so good). The staff are also usually super friendly. The only bad service experience I had was the last time I visited on a Friday night, I asked one of the staff at the bar for a drink recommendation and was told that he was too busy to recommend a drink to me and I should just pick one. I was a bit put off by that, but enjoyed my time there regardless."}
{"text":"Great portions of food. Been here twice now and will keep coming back for brunch. House potatoes are great and I'm not a potato girl, so they're doing it right! Mimosa is always a great kickstarter as well! Bartender isn't too heavy on the alcohol which is great, can't start a day tipsy, or can you."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. Ordered insomnia burger and avocado chicken sandwich. Took a bit long for the food to arrive. Chicken sandwich tasted good but the burger was cold and undercooked. We informed the server and they took care of the situation very well. The remade burger was delicious and warm, according to my husband.  The staff was very friendly here. The restaurant setting was beautiful. I am not into bar restaurants in general, but this place changed my view on that a bit. The food was good - yet not the best but I really like their atmosphere and the service so I am rating it a four star."}
{"text":"I've been to insomnia for brunch multiple times, but today I decided to switch to something other than my traditional eggs benny order, so I opted for the 2 eggs. AMy boyfriend had the PLT, what he usually gets.   Besides the amazing house fries and salad that comes with every savoury brunch dish, I was pleasantly surprised at how the sides tied in with the classic eggs and toast. The portion was significant and filled me up without being too greasy and bloating. I honestly preferred this to the eggs Benedict I usually have.  On the downside, be warned that the service is usually quite slow on the weekends, perhaps due to how busy Insomnia can get.   For first timers that are looking for specialty dishes, either go with heaven on earth (heap of pancakes with blueberries, whip cream, etc) or the eggs Benny (they have many options). You won't be disappointed with their house fries (tossed in a special sauce that could be a combination of ketchup and BBQ sauce). Their side salad is also a tasteful addition to the mix, drizzled in a light sesame-y dressing."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favourite places in Toronto. I moved to NYC a few years ago and always try to come back to Insomnia for a meal when I'm in town. The menu is always changing and adding great new dishes but they've managed to keep all my old favourites. On my last visit my friend and I split some tacos...The fish was definitely my fav! For my main I had the walnut penne (one of my all time favs) and it did not disappoint! My friend had the burger which she said was great, their fries are awesome!! Also had a few cocktails...the Toronto Sour is great! I will definitely keep recommending this spot to my Toronto friends and keep visiting when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for a long time and finally gave it a try- it was great! They make the best drip coffee in the city. They brew it with cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg and oh my goodness- absolutely delicious! However, we had to wait an hour for a table for 2, not sure if it's worth the wait on the weekends but definitely give it a go during the week."}
{"text":"A packed house, and a lineup out the door the day after a major snow storm is definitely an omen that one is in for a good brunch.   Brunch at insomnia did not disappoint, although it did not blow me away either.  The menu may lack creativity but is executed fairly well. The smoked salmon benny was nicely done, the hollandaise was good not great, smoked salmon was fresh, and the poached egg was sufficiently runny. Memphis benny was ok, but the pulled pork was a bit too sweet for my liking. Side salad was mundane, and the home fries were covered in a tomato-based, ketchup like sauce that I wasn't a huge fan of. I also had a fruit smoothie which was delicious and not overly sweet.   The service was lackluster, a little slow, and not as attentive as one would hope. The place itself is a fair size, and has a down to earth feel. Despite the packed house, once our orders were taken our food came out quickly, so don't be intimidated by the lineup as they turn their tables quickly.  If you are looking for a solid, traditional brunch insomnia is certianly a good option."}
{"text":"After October's CIBC Run for the Cure, my friends and I headed here for some well-deserved post-running brunch.   My friends had been before, while it was my first time.   As always, I was stunned by the price of fresh-squeezed orange juice and opted for water or ginger ale instead.   The atmosphere is a bit crazy. It's a busy brunch place and you may have to line up, as with most brunch places in the city, it seems.   The menu is extensive with lots of savoury and lots of sweet options and the pricing is what you'd expect for the Annex and for brunch foods.   I ordered the eggs Florentine. There was at least an entire bunch of spinach on it. That's both good and bad. Good, because spinach is good for you and bad because it took away from the tastes of the hollandaise sauce, etc. However, the eggs themselves were delicious.   One interesting thing I noted were the home fries. They were large, real potatoes but were absolutely drenched in this house made barbecue sauce. To Insomnia's credit, they tell you that on the menu (although they don't mention that you won't be able to see the potatoes for the amount of sauce they use) but I guess I didn't know what I was getting myself into. And I'm a person who loves them some condiments. This was just overkill.   At the end of the day, the service was good (by brunch terms, so relatively good), the prices were normal and the potatoes......well, saucy."}
{"text":"Insomnia was a GREAT spot for Brunch! The decor inside was absolutely gorgeous and the atmosphere was perfect for the bachelorette party I was with!! We had a table for 12 girls and the service was impeccable! Although in Ontario you can't serve alcohol until 11:00am (which we didn't know because we are from the states) Claire, our waitress, had us wait 10 extra minutes before we left so she could give us a breakfast shot at 11:00am on the dot...all for free!! The food was also TO DIE for! Everyone enjoyed their meals as well as the service. I would DEFINITELY recommend going to Insomnia for brunch!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I had Insomnia on my list of places to try for a long time and finally came here for winterlicious and it did not disappoint. The tacos were great, the chicken in the chicken and waffles was so flavorful and perfectly spiced. I can't wait to come back and try the brunch."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. I ordered Charlotte, eggs benedict with smoked salmon. It did not disappoint me. It was very good and the portion is so big, I could not finish it. I also loved the homefries that came with the eggs benny. However, this place is super packed during weekends. Remember to book your table first, or you would need to wait at least half an hour."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch! Stopped by here on a Sunday afternoon with some friends and it was a total hit. I loved the artsy decor and casual atmosphere. Some of the seats in the back are bean bag chairs and sofas which gave the place a comfortable, home-y feel.  I ordered the Huevos Rancheros but I also had a bite of the Memphis and Charlotte. Everything was delicious. Loved the homefries in their \"legendary sauce\". I couldn't stop eating them and when I finished mine, I started stealing my boyfriend's.  At first look, it may not seem like a lot of food as I remember my friends mentioning that the portions were on the smaller side. We had even planned to order the Heaven on Earth as dessert but by the end of the meal, everyone was either stuffed or didn't finish. We're all pretty big eaters so I'm very happy with that. Will have to come back again to try out that French toast!  Our server was friendly and attentive even though the place was really busy. Very positive experience overall."}
{"text":"I came here for a weekend brunch with a good friend and really liked the place.    In terms of the ambiance and décor, they have ample seating consisting of normal tables, a bar and some comfy lounge chars with tables at the back.  Nicely decorated.    Food: I ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict.  Egg was poached perfectly with great runniness, and the amount of salmon on it was just right.  It wasn't overwhelming, but it was enough.  The hash browns that came with it, omg, those were amazing.  I think they were caramelized or something.    Verdict: Great brunch spot.  Will come back for lunch or dinner and do further review then."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner to celebrate our anniversary. I suggest you make a reservation because you'll probably be waiting for a while if you don't. It's a busy place but it's intimate. Think of it as a mix between casual and friendly with a tiny of romance. We had a table at the back where over there, it's more cushioned seats and lounge couches. The atmosphere was very romantic and close. I was very impressed even before we got the food. The selection of drinks is not your average list, you're going to have a selection of cosmos, martinis, wines etc. But they are made just as well for the price you're paying. I ordered the crab cakes for an appetizer and the seafood penne. Both are slightly on the spicy side but not to the point that it overwhelms your tastebuds. You can taste the food and the spice adds a kick afterwards. The seafood entree is served as a big portion so if you were planning a three course meal, make sure your stomach can take it. The tables are also kinda small, at least with all the food we ordered so be prepared for some plate stacking. Guess it got more intimate for us too to squish everything so it won't fall off the table. The service however was pretty slow. Even after we ordered our food and drinks, it took forever for them to even pick up the empty plates, let alone give us our bill. The fastest service we had was went we were getting seated and that was because we had a reservation so no waiting required.  Overall, if you want to impress someone on a first date, or take them out to celebrate for a birthday, come here. Again, make sure you get a reservation. I'll most likely be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Nothing gets the yuppies up and out early quite like brunch. I got here around 11am on a holiday Monday and the place was packed. After leaving my name and number, they texted me about 40 minutes later to tell me my table was ready (super convenient because you can leave and the restaurant and walk around).   Apart from the standard restaurant chairs, they've also got tables in the back with comfy one seater sofas that make the perfect excuse to linger longer.   The eggs benedict here is great, but the star of the plate was the home fries. There's also a side salad that comes with the eggs benedict so you can feel less guilty about your meal.   Service is fast and attentive. I would definitely recommend the trip down here. It's right beside Bathurst station so it's easily accessible so you really don't have an excuse not to come here."}
{"text":"Brunch was awesome! Home fries were coated with delicious BBQ sauce. Eggs were poached perfectly. Coffee was great. Plus, they are very social media savvy--Foursquare, Facebook, and/or Yelp check-ins are encouraged and even rewarded. :-)"}
{"text":"Not a far walk from the subway which is a convenient plus. The restaurant was full, but the waiting time for a table of two was acceptable, and the wait to get our food after we ordered seemed nonexistent. The staff are very friendly, and the food is extremely delicious -- home fries are a must. The pricing is very fair for the amount of food you receive, as well as the quality. Clean location, fantastic food, and worth a second visit."}
{"text":"Better than average food, but what I liked most were some very cheap vegetarian options. There is a veggie wrap for $6 that is quite large and delicious."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends to have brunch at 10:30 on a Sunday. We were a group of 6 but half of us did not arrive on time so we couldn't be seated. The hostesses were nice enough to hold a big table for us for 30min and luckily everyone arrived by then. So just be prepared to wait in line for a while if you have a big group and make sure everyone arrives on time!  Food: I ordered the special omelette with smoked chicken. The portion is generous, omelette was filled with veggies and other ingredients. And surprisingly the smoked chicken was not too salty. Now the best part of the meal is the potatoes! They're cubes of crispy fried goodness covered in a savory tomato sauce. I've never had anything like it. Will definitely come back just for the potatoes.  Drink: I ordered a grapefruit mimosa and my friend ordered a martini. Both were decent. My mimosa had only a faint grapefruit taste and a decent amount of sparkling wine (no extra sweetness added which I like).   Service: our server was very friendly and came around often to check on us.  All in all will definitely come back for brunch, maybe next time to try one of their eggs Benedict's. My reason my 4/5 stars is mainly for my dinner experience where I felt the food was only mediocre and overpriced. Come here for brunch not dinner!!"}
{"text":"Generic brunch place, but they don't take reservations after 10am! This place gets pretty packed in the morning, so expect a 30-45 minute after 10am."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite brunch spot in TO. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The restaurant was very clean and cozy feeling. The food is what locks you in though  we started with a cappuccino and a smoothie which were both delicious. Then I got the Heaven on Earth with fits its title to a T. It was the perfect combination of sweet and savory. And my husband got the Memphis Benedict with was amazing!!! Definitely the place to beat for brunch."}
{"text":"Had our girls night here and it was a very pleasant experience. The ambience is simple and chic.  The food was amazing and at a very reasonable prices. Went on a Thursday and the half priced martinis were delish!    I had the chicken and waffles which tasted amazing.  Portion size was just right. Waffles were a bit soggy and the presentation was a kind of odd with the slaw just slopped on top.  Overall though I was very satisfied with my meal!  I would definitely get it again.   The restaurant itself is quite narrow and small - so I wouldn't  recommend for very large groups."}
{"text":"id say im a regular at insomnia.  im always pretty happy when i come here and have no complaints.  after coming here for years, i had a big group (around 20) come.in for.my birthday with a little bit of late notice before the holidays but the service organization was nothing short of amazing.  i really had an amazing time with friends and the restaurant was easy going.  the owner/manager who took my reservation was fast and easy going and all was smooth.  i just really appreciate efficient and understanding service and to my surprise the food was actually more incredible than ever! thank you insomnia :)"}
{"text":"Great spot. Good food, nice atmosphere, friendly staff. It is a little cramped inside and often busy. Eggs Benny is my go to for brunch and chicken and waffles was great for dinner!"}
{"text":"Ask to sit in Scott's section. He's super sweet and attentive. The delicious food was just a bonus to his superb service. The potatoes in the special sauce were divine! The pineapple mimosas were super refreshing. An overall grand place to enjoy brunch on a Sunday!"}
{"text":"I came here a couple weeks ago for Sunday brunch with a couple friends from out of town.  We were asked if we wanted to sit at the bar but we had time to spare so we waited behind 2-3 groups.  We were sitted at the High-Chairs near the middle of the resto and personally it felt WEIRD because I was sitting way UP there while next to us sat a couple of ladies in LOW comfy sofa seats.    It felt like if I slope to one side of my chair, I would fall on one of them or would stomp on their purses/bags.  When I got off of my chair, my CROUCH was next to one of their faces if they turned over to face me.  Anyways, I HAD to order their Daily Special (Poach Eggs w/Hollandaise on top of a crispy RICE PATTY), which I forgot the name it sounded Asian.  I TOLD my friend to have the Huevo Rancheros, while another got the Eggs Charlotte.  I had a taste of my Rice Patty and left it alone... Started to ATTACK my friend's Huevo and Charlotte.  I give both a passing grade, but not something spectacular.    One of my friend's did give me a so-so comment on their homefries, and saw most of it left on the plate while I did clean off most of mine but personally I prefer others if I had a choice."}
{"text":"Great experience. Went brunch on a Saturday, thought i would wait for an hour but in 15 mins we had a table. We had Richard for our waiter, the guy is awesome, funny, and not to mention cute too.   The food was great, I had the eggs Benedict with salmon, quality ingredients, cooked perfectly. The spice sausage was awesome! we ordered seconds. Overall, coming from a avid foodie, it was a great experience.   Going forward this place is on my top 3 fav brunch places in the city."}
{"text":"This is the absolute definition of expectation vs reality. When I walked right into the restaurant I was completely shook, it looked nothing like I imaged. Not going to lie, I was super disappointed. The pictures on their website were so pretty and looked like it was a higher-end kind of restaurant. But..... umm.... yea.... it was nothing like that. I also made a reservation and we got the worst seats possible and there were so many empty seats available. Besides the environment, the food and service was decent. My pasta was a little cold but it wasn't a big issue. I am still a little upset but it was a \"good\" experience."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with my friend. Another friend raved about Insomnia so we decided to finally check it out.   Never having been to this establishment, I decided to make a reservation. I made a reservation at midnight and by noon the next day, our reservation was confirmed. Being able to do all of this on-line is always a bonus in my books.   Our server was great. She was very friendly and professional. I found the pricing to be reasonable; I won't have to file for bankruptcy if I choose to be a 'regular' of this joint.   Food was good. They have daily specials which is always nice.   Would love to check out their brunch.  Until then, I would easily give this place 3.75-4.00 stars."}
{"text":"The only \"nice\" bar in the Bloor & Bathurst area. And the only place you can get a $4 cocktail or beer on a Saturday night (hence the 5-star upgrade)! Excellent service, perfect lighting, and comfy chairs and couches in the back.   The menu looks great but I've only had the fries & chipotle mayo (which were great). There is a nice selection of beer and cocktails and the place itself is very clean. Every other bar in this area is kind of a dump so this review is partially based on location but also genuinely on what Insomnia has to offer. They have drink specials every night of the week including $3 beers and shots. I've heard their brunch is also great. Our server was extremely attentive and approachable. Finally, the management takes pride in running a good business and will take any concerns raised seriously. Every Yelper can appreciate that."}
{"text":"Another great brunch spot in Toronto! Nice cozy atmosphere with friendly staff. Tried the pulled pork egg Benedict (memphis) was 4.5/5, loved it. Pulled pork had great flavour and the home fries were super crispy, they use their own ketchup sauce on the fries which was a different twist. I also tried the heaven on earth (French toast, cream cheese and berries). Probably one of the best French toast I've tried. Super filling though, I would definitely be back to try the other menu items."}
{"text":"I came here on family day with a couple friends for an easy and casual dinner. The atmosphere was cozy, relaxed and super hip - I thought that the lights were beautiful and really added to the ambience. However, our experience started off poorly.   We waited for a good 10-15 minutes before we were seated, despite the restaurant not being overly busy - there just wasn't any acknowledgement from the staff that we were waiting. The server/host wasn't very warm, welcoming or engaging which was evident in the lack of eye contact. Once we were seated, we waited another 10-15 minutes before a server came and asked us for our drink orders. Getting the server's attention was also a challenge - when we were ready to order, we made eye contact with our server. While he acknowledged us, it took him a while before actually returning to get our orders.   I had the burger ($10, no sides). At best, the burger was mediocre - it wasn't particularly flavourful or juicy. My friend had the spicy tomato penne and was similarly disappointed - she said it was too salty and overly sauced. However, the garlic aioli that comes with their fries is the /bomb.com./ I would shamelessly lick that off a plate.   Probably wouldn't return of my own choosing, but if I do return, I will just have the fries."}
{"text":"Had dinner here a while ago with a few friends for one of my friend's birthday's, and it was amazing! I ordered the Rosedale pizza without onions, and I was extremely pleased. The area is great too because there's so much to do around there. I'd definitely go again to try some of their other dishes, cause everything looked so delicious."}
{"text":"Food was really good except they could use a better bread for their Chicken Thigh Sandwich. Also tried their French 72 drink and it was really good. Our server was really nice and she was very help-full!!!I'm gonna plan to go visit them for brunch and let you guys know!"}
{"text":"After hearing great reviews from some friends I finally checked this place out. We went for brunch on a Tuesday and it was absolutely amazing. The service was also fabulous. Our server was so friendly and accommodating and the food was great. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed breakfast/brunch here.   They have a good amount of options on the menu. We went with the waiter recommendations, the well publicized Heaven French Toast and Eggs Charlotte Benedict. Both dishes were tasty and nice portions.   If I didn't care about staying in shape and being healthy, I wouldn't mind that Heaven French Toast at least 3-5 times a week, mmmm mmmm mmmm."}
{"text":"Winterlicious meals are truly a bargain, and if you check-in to Insomnia on Yelp, you get an extra $10 OFF when ordering $50 or more. I've added 1lb. of Mussels with a Quebec draft beer Blanche de Chambly. The strong salty flavour of the sauce complements the subtle taste of the mussels. Blanche de Chambly favours more to sweet beer lovers. As for my Winterlicious entree, the Smoked Chicken Taco was delicious, but messy to eat. Would have been great if it was in the form of a wrap. The Wild Mushroom and Lentil Sherpherd's Pie was interesting. Mash potatoes stacked on a pile of lentils while few pieces of mushroom sitting on top. Perfect for those looking for a light meal."}
{"text":"I don't think I'd eaten here in a decade, for no particular reason. We took our two year old for breakfast and had a great meal! The portions are huge and they can accommodate a Celiac with ease....not just gluten free bread on a plate but actual gluten free fryers and toasters! It took two of us to finish an omelette and the potatoes were delicious (smothered in the sauce.) They take reservations if you come before 10 and I can tell you it got very busy."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday morning and waited 45 minutes for a table. Was nice how I was able to give them my number and receive a text when our table was ready.   I ordered the huevos rancheros. Overall serving size looks great, but it's mostly filler from the salad and the home fries. When the hostess asked me how I liked my eggs, I got a bit confused since typical huevos is scrambled. In a fluster I asked for sunny side up (my usual) without thinking about what I was actually ordering!! So my meal came with two sunny side up eggs on a thin spread of refried beans and cheese on a corn tortilla. Overall tasted pretty good, but honestly nothing special or amazing. I wish they gave two corn tortillas each with one egg. In terms of their home fries I didn't like how they came pre-covered in ketchup/red sauce, but did enjoy their nice crunch!   With regards to pricing, it's typical of what you would expect in Toronto for brunch but I think there are probably better options for your dollars worth!"}
{"text":"Came here for early dinner ~5:30 with a friend, not many people. My friend an I shared an arugula salad with goat cheese, pear and pecans $12 - i noticed that salads only sprinkle a FEW nuts on top, I wanted more :( Think it was the goat cheese that made it salty, but the salad is nice. I wouldn't get it again just because $12 for a salad is a lot and it wasn't filling :(  I also got a curried tofu taco, which is delicious! the taco is crispy and warm, and inside is juicy and has comforting flavours. For $6, a nice appetizer, but again, not filling.  Overall, 3.5 stars- really good quality food with beautiful and consistent food presentation! I just think it's a little pricey personally."}
{"text":"nice staff and super yummy. a little pricey but definitely worth it"}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious Brunch finally! I have been wanting to go to this restaurant since a year and a half ago! We got there early so we got seated with our choice. The staff here are really attentive and the service was very prompt. Food did not take a long time to arrive, my friend and I both ordered the same thing practically: starter: Mini waffle, main: classic eggs benny with peameal bacon, dessert: carrot cake. The portions are very generous and everything tasted very good. Yes even the salad was really good. The Legendary Fries, very good or as Evelyn A. calls them...the potato things! Yes the potato things are really good! Get them. Even their coffee had a little bit of a unique taste...do I taste a hint of cinnamon? My friend got the pink velvet cake, get the pink velvet cake. My carrot cake was a bit too coconutty for me, but still good. They have a huge list of drinks available, if you're looking for a lot of options they offer a lot here. Definitely will be coming back here although a bit pricey, I'm eyeing (salivating) their other dishes from their regular menu."}
{"text":"Since writing my last review a manager from the restaurant contacted me and offered me a gift certificate to make up for my poor experience. I was very happy to hear from him and took him up on his offer. The decor and ambiance is still great. The waitress we had was amazing! She was lovely, funny, and very helpful. Unfortunately, the food just isn't for me. My pasta was mediocre. I would consider coming back for drinks, especially considering the neighbourhood, but I doubt I will order food."}
{"text":"I raved about this restaurant and brought them there to enjoy the food and ambiance. On the same day when a poutinerie was hosting their anniversary nearby, it was great to avoid the long lines. Our waitress was excellent with impeccable service to our group and the food was amazing like last time.   We started off with calamari for the group and we polished it off in no time. A few of us ordered shrimp linguine and the waffle chicken which were the favorites.  One friend ordered the steak with mash potatoes but it was slightly overcooked.  Everyone enjoyed their time as expected and we needed to walk off the food along Bloor. Some wanted ice cream but we ended up walking past the poutinerie and ended up at a bar to talk about travel. Can't wait until next time and see if they add more to their already fabulous menu."}
{"text":"The food was decent, and the manami patties and gluten free toast were really good.  I actually thought they had forgotten the gluten free request and had given me real toast.  The only annoying part was the extra charge for substituting gluten free toast for the gluten-containing home fries, and the menu was loaded with other extra charges."}
{"text":"Awesome time......my first time and WILL come back again.... Caesars were good...my old fashioned Awesometastic and the food? Wings? Great... chicken and waffles? Incredible....thanks for really good experience.      My only regret of the night...I didn't get the Waitress's name....SHE WAS AWESOME!!!! it was the coldest night and she went out of the way to give us both a lil warm-up shot before we left..."}
{"text":"Terrific menu at reasonable price. Hip crowd and nice waiters. Good decor. Easy and comfortable place for dinner when going to movies across the street."}
{"text":"Great for late night drinks and brunch. They have a drink and food combo every night which I enjoy. Be prepared for a wait if you are going for brunch. I personally prefer the potatoes \"naked\" without the sauce they add to it. Love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Yummy cocktails and delicious appetizers. Awesome music to jam to.   Come early to avoid line ups or better yet book a reservation and make it easy on yourself."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time this week with friends. The atmosphere is very nice, we sat at the back of the restaurant on couches which are really comfortable. The artwork was very interesting on the walls and had a nice small comfortable seating area. The music was also nice and new but not overpowering loud enough to still have a conversation to hear each other with no problem. The service was good the food was great I had one of the pizzas and it was enough to take home. I will definitely be back with new friends!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best brunch place I have ever been to. Too bad I am from the states so I won't be returning as often as I want to.   Came with a few friends and we ordered the memphis (chipotle bbq pulled pork benedict), the charlotte (smoked salmon benedict), plt sandwich (rosemary focaccia, peameal bacon, lettuce, tomato, garlic aioli), and the heaven on earth ( french toast, berries, cream cheese, honey, pure maple syrup) to share. The food was flavorful and the home fries with their legendary sauce was absolutely delicious. The heaven on earth was something new. The first few bites were good, but the cream cheese became a little overwhelming after that.   Overall, I was very satisfied with my meal. Would definitely be coming back if I was to visit Toronto again."}
{"text":"Insomnia for brunch used to be the best kept secret. I have been going regularly for over 15 years and the food and service is always great. Anytime we eat brunch somewhere else we end up comparing it to the insomnia scale, and nothing comes close for the quality,  portion size and price. Now that the cat's out of the bag, make a reservation. This place is popular with line ups out the door even in the winter! We love this place."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner for a friend's birthday and it pretty much met my expectations, based on what I had read and heard previously. We ordered the prix fixe menu and found that the portions were not as large as we had expected. That being said, the taco was flavourful, the vegetarian shepherds pie was well worth it, and the dessert (cake) was rich and moist.   As part of a big group, I found that the service was not as good as I would've liked. It did take us a while to flag down our server at times, and she seemed to be a bit overstretched. We were unable to use the Yelp check in coupon because we ordered from the prix fixe menu. Though I understand that, it was frustrating that we had presented the coupon earlier in the meal and only found out that we weren't able to use it right when we got the bill.   I would definitely return to try their breakfast/brunch prix fixe -- which is essentially their Summerlicious menu -- however I would probably try to avoid coming at a very busy time. In summary, good food at a reasonable price and a convenient location, though a little on the noisier side."}
{"text":"Everyone raves about this place for its weekend brunch, but personally I like their Friday nights. They have dj's most nights but on Friday they are playing various kinds of electronic music, with comfy couches to chill in the back area, and bartenders who make strong drinks. A nice option for when you want to hear some good beats without the hype or effort of an actual night club, although the dj is rather tucked away from view.  And while it definitely a decent place to go have a drink and chill out, and the food is great too! The Little Italy pizza is a perfect snack although I prefer a side of tomato sauce to give it a bit more sauceyness."}
{"text":"Good brunch, but long wait! At least they take your number and text you when it's your turn, so you can go have coffee elsewhere before you're called in.  Good staff. Make a reservation in advance for sure"}
{"text":"Sooo good! I've been here like 6 times now, each time ordering something new and each time being overwhelmed by how good it is. Highly recommend eggs benny or waffles!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now. Its a fail-proof spot, there is a huge drink menu, good hot bevy options, and a decently priced food menu.  During the day, its a good place for a work lunch/meeting. Its not too loud or busy. I felt comfortable hanging around for a couple hours, having only bought a coffee.  In the evening, I'd consider it a safe place to go on a first date, or drinks with your friends. The lighting is nice (candles on the table, sparkly lights on the ceiling)  They are open late (till 2am), 7 days a week, which is a bonus. I like their hot bevy's with alcohol. It feels like a mix between a bar and a late night cafe... a decent alternative for a weekday night drink."}
{"text":"They don't take reservations for brunch after 10AM, so my party of 6 waited about 45 minutes to get a table. Nice part is, you can elect to get a text message from Insomnia when there's only about 10 minutes left of wait, so you can step away to window shop nearby, etc while waiting.  Once again, solid food at great portion sizes. Note: they don't do Summerlicious lunch on weekends! My friends ordered different versions of the egg benedict - salmon (Charlotte) $16 and bacon (St. Alban's Classic) $15, which comes with homefries and mixed greens. They said the hollandaise sauce was very, very good, but the poached egg itself unfortunately retained the vinegar taste and as a result the texture is unpleasant. While I am a huge fan of the homefries here, my friends thought it was only ok and didn't like having so much sauce on the fries already (sauce on the side next time, plz).  I tried to order the vegan quinoa wrap, which looks huge and phenomenal, but was told that it is not on the brunch menu :'(   It was one of my friend's birthday, so we received a small slice of carrot cake on the house. Friends looooved it - said that everything must have been made from scratch, including the cream cheese icing, because the cake wasn't nauseating overly sweet and the icing didn't taste like weird chemicals like it does when coming from a store-bought tube."}
{"text":"I love going to Insomnia whether its brunch lunch or dinner. They have delicious, ranging dishes for the vegan, vegetarian and meat eater in you!  Their service us always friendly even when it gets busy! Also the ambience of the wood features and mini string lightsis a plus!    Ive had their fried chicken, poutine, salads, various benedicts and tofu omlette. The thing i love is that no matter what youre eating the consistency doesnt fluctuate.   As a vegetarian im used to 30%effort dishes that some restaurants see as mandatory tk provide and not really part of the menu. At Insomnia its part of their menu.   Love that they support local charities as well!"}
{"text":"Good service and nice ambiance. Get the nachos for value! They come loaded with guac, sour cream, salsa, etc and can feed a party of five or more. Not as good as Sneaky Dee's but the setting at Insomnia is a lot nicer. For dessert I tried the flourless chocolate lava cake, tastes perfect on a winter's day paired with a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch today and had such a great experience. I was running late and my friends had to wait for me a while at the bar since the place was packed. By the time I got there we still had to wait another half hour or so for a table, but manager (I think?) on duty, Erin, went above and beyond to make us comfortable. She brought us coffee and fruit while we waited and checked in on us often. When we final got our table it was a big and comfortable one. Our food came out super quickly after we ordered. I had the Memphis pulled pork Benny; it could have been a bit warmer but the flavors were delicious. The mimosas are cheap too! Overall I think the food here is about a 4, but I really felt that the service we experienced here was worth a 5 star rating. They really went above and beyond, we were very impressed. Thanks Erin!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal. Every experience at Insomnia has succeeded all of my expectations. I've been for brunch and for dinner and both of the menus are filled with many delicious options.   Brunch;  The Isabelle eggs Benedict was very simple and not as filling, but the fries made up for it.  The legendary home fries, included in most savory brunch dishes or can be ordered as a side, are to die for. They melt in your mouth and that sauce truly deserves to be called legendary.    The \"Heaven On Earth\" French toast with assorted berries with cream cheese really is heaven on earth. Every bite is filled with flavor and leaves you wanting more.   Dinner;  Ordered a plate of nachos and the Mac and cheese, I basically had to be rolled out of there.  The nachos come in a heaping mountain that's big enough to share with a group and start to feel a little full. Needless to say, I had most of it packed up for home. The Mac and cheese is creamy, mouthwatering and filling on its own. Highly recommend.   As for dessert, the climax cake is a must. It may look small but it's a rich, chocolatey taste in every bite.  Service is always incredible, friendly, and efficient.  Will definitely return for many years to come!"}
{"text":"Came here recently with the SO - I had been talking about this place with him, and knew that he would love the vibe. And course, he did!   The spot is trendy and kinda indie, with charming lights and paintings from local artists. Oh and a great drinks list. It's popular so make reservations possible! They have an easy online system.   Crab cakes - delicious Chicken thigh sandwich - tasty Shrimp linguine - really flavorful Iceberg drink - refreshing Blush mojito - good, once the ice chilled it and diluted it a bit.   Overall great experience. This spot is perfect to catch up with friends, first (or 2nd, 3rd) dates, and have some great food/drinks.   I had to take off one star because it seemed like none of the staff knew whose food went where and brought the wrong dishes to multiple patrons. They brought us a salad we didn't order and then realized it was for the table beside us... Except it was the wrong salad for them too. This kinda thing happened throughout the night. However, the staff were really nice and swift about making the appropriate the changes."}
{"text":"I've been to Insomnia (for dinner) twice so far. Delicious walnut penne and wild mushroom & lentil shepherd's pie! I also really liked the pink velvet cake. I love the romantic and intimate ambiance. Service was good. Not too thrilled about being seated at the table towards the very back of the restaurant with the two couches - twice! (Though the couches certainly added to the coziness factor of the whole dining experience, it was uncomfortable being hunched over in a tight seating area near the kitchens.) Overall, I would definitely be coming back to Insomnia for a third time. I've heard good things about  their brunch menu and I'm really looking forward to having brunch here."}
{"text":"Food: (5/5) Had a juicy steak, and draft beer + lychee mojito for drinks. Everything tasted great! Lychee mojito isn't on the menu but you can ask for it.  Service: (5/5) Nice waiters, fast service.   Atmosphere: (5/5) Great place for meeting up with friends, either at night or in the morning."}
{"text":"Great service, seated at the bar, really enjoyed both the well crafted old fashioned and the latte. Had a breakfast peameal sandwich, meaty well seasoned and very good portion size. Salad was well done, not over dressing coated just right. Loved the sauce on the potatoes though they could have been a tad hotter. Ambience is nice, lots of choices for types of seating, from near window to bar to standard tables. Not to noisy mid day, not sure what weekends would be like.  Free shot at the end of the lunch wasn't a bad deal either! I'll be back to try more things for sure."}
{"text":"One of my favourite brunch spots- the coffee is way too addicting, as are the potatoes that come with the meals. Yum!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the ambience of the restaurant. It feels like I'm sitting at an artist's alley cafe with all the string lights, polished wooden tables, paintings, and dim lighting. I was here on a Monday night to try the  Summerlicious Dinner~$25  Pulled Pork Taco (Soft Tortilla, Avocado, Pico De Gallo, Marinated Cabbage) - It's exactly what you expect it to be like, but better :)  Wild Mushroom & Lentil Shepherd's Pie (with Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Mushroom Gravy) - the mashed potatoes are really fluffy and buttery. I wish there was more of it since most of the dish was filled with lentils. I don't really like lentils but they made it work well in the shepherd's pie.  Burnt Marshmallow Ice Cream Smore - THIS IS A MUST TRY. ENOUGH SAID. IT'S LIKE HEAVEN IN YOUR MOUTH.  Overall, I had a pleasant experience. The only reason why I took out a star was because our waiter made a rude remark to me (that I assumed was meant to be a joke) but actually kinda stung, and it's been engraved into this restaurant's Summerlicious memory, unfortunately. I think out of the 2 of us that went, the waiter didn't know I was going to be the one paying for the meal hence their initial justification for the \"harmless\" jab. Regardless, the food at insomnia was impressive!"}
{"text":"meh. I don't know this place is fine, only went for drinks and they seemed incredibly overpriced. I just don't really like the vibe of this place."}
{"text":"I think this place is pretty good.  Ample seating, great service, a decent well rounded menu.   Free coffee refills  (note: don't go if you don't like cinnamon in your filter coffee, but I think it's pretty damn amazing)  One problem though -- I got the eggs benedict on a gluten free potato thing and it was actually pretty gross.  I was happy with the way the egg was cooked but the potato patty seemed like some sort of frozen meal dinner thing and it wasn't crispy or even the slightest bit tasty and the benedict sauce was actually atrocious.    The benedict sauce was a gelatinized version of egg yolks mixed in with a ton of dilly dijon.  It just sort of sat on top of the egg in a blob and wobbled and shook when I prodded it with a fork. *retch*  I will be back, but not for the benedict.  You won me over with your weird coffee."}
{"text":"My favourite thing about Insomnia are the big comfy couches you can sit on in the back, making it a great cozy brunch spot. The Ceasars are yummy (my top branching priority!) and they have a bacon Ceasar as well. The food is really good, though there is nothing overly interesting on the menu, which is primarily versions of eggs Benedict. Isomnia is worth visiting if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch! What I particularly enjoy were the potaotes. The home fries were all coated with ketchup which provided a sweet and tangy taste. They also have a variety of vegan options due to its location. The brunch menu only lasts until 3PM and when I arrived at 2:50 I was still given the brunch menu which was nice. I find their portions quite fair and I enjoy that there wasn't an overwhelming amount of fruit compared to some other brunch spots I have been to.   Parking is a little hard in the area so be prepared to circle around to find a spot.   If I'm ever in the area I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stumbled apon Insomnia on Yelp after searching for a great spot for brunch. Bookmarked it and saved it for later.   Last night for dinner, my boyfriend surprised me and brought me here. Although when we visited, brunch was not being served, he thought it would still be something new to try - little did he know I already had my eye on this gem.   Arrived at around 7:15 and promptly was seated to our choice of the couches in the back end of the Restaurant.   Our waiter, Vincent quickly came by and helped us to some water. As we hadn't had a chance to look over the menu, he gave us some time to go over our options.   After some difficult decisions with the great menu options, we decided to go for the Fried Calamari to start, each a Insomnia Burger and a Poutine to share.   Let's start with the app, Fried Calamari- as I will admit that it wasn't on the crispy side as I usually like it, the taste of this calamari completely excused the fact that it wasn't up to my crisp bar. I'm not sure what was in the batter, but this calamari was one of the best I have ever tried. The perfect amount of Tzatziki sauce also accompanied it with enough to get a dollop on each calamari piece.   To the main, the Insomnia Burger- what you expect from a burger; fresh tomatoes, lettuce and red onion. The garlic aioli tasted great with the cheddar cheese and pickles. To put it simple, this burger was nothing less of what I expected- delicious!   Poutine- I need not say more. Usually.... When eating a Poutine, you have to compromise the amount of gravy covered fries you can have with cheese curds. No compromising on this Poutine! Completely perfect! Although not important to me, note that the Poutine is Vegetarian and Gluten free!   To add to our overall visit, our waiter Vincent was super helpful in suggesting his favourites and helping me choose. Not over our shoulders the whole time but kept a steady eye on water refills and plate clearing when done. Super cool guy with a knack for connecting with his guests!"}
{"text":"Brunch here is amazing!! Been here a couple times already and they don't fail to deliver!   Favourites are Heaven on Earth and their Eggs Benedicts! Heaven on Earth is their french toast with cream cheese and berries! Definitely a must try!!! :) So goood!!  And their Eggs Bennies come with salad and homefries - so much food it's hard to finish!!"}
{"text":"Went there today, the staff was very pleasant and we were seated quickly.  Fresh cold water was available at each table, which I liked. Service was quick in ordering but receiving the meal was a bit of a long wait.  The chicken sandwich tasted good, but my \"chuck burger\" was cold and raw.  It was pink and obviously under cooked.   The waitress came by and I explained the situation.  She took away the dish and apologized.  After a bit of wait, eating their fries was delicious, I finally received a cooked Insomnia burger.  It was delicious.  So I know stuff happens, so I will still give them 4 stars.   But please, don't let it happen again."}
{"text":"I came back for brunch and it was...*drools* I had been meaning to go for a while now (and my boyfriend has not so subtly been dropping hints that he wanted to go) and I regret not going sooner.   I've read reviews on the home fries and figured...you know, they're just home fries, right? WRONG. They were so good. I got the eggs benny and bf got the huevos rancheros. I personally like the huevos more and my boyfriend liked my plate more. None the less, I still managed to clear off my plate finishing my breakfast before my other half did. WHICH NEVER HAPPENS.  The place was packed on a Sunday morning so we ended up at the bar area and the bartender serving us was awesome. She was attentive and super sweet!   I will be back for the huevos rancheros and those home fries!!!!"}
{"text":"The service super slow, the food took forever, and the food itself was pretty mediocre. I honestly used to like this restaurant a lot specially their brunch and I like how many options they have in the menu for vegan and vegetarians and gluten free etc however my hubby and I did enjoy our visit to insomnia this time, super slow service, a vegetable wrap, half Caesar salad and a huecos rancheros took longer than 35 mins and I don't mind waiting when the food it's good, buuut I wasn't.  What happened insomnia?  We are disappointed and we want to love you again!"}
{"text":"All time favourite brunch place. Their Steak & egg literally cured my depression. Lychee Martinis is my favourite drink."}
{"text":"I dined here for Sunday Brunch with my sister and loved it! We didn't make a reservation but luckily found seats at the bar which was open seating. This place gets packed so be sure to come early!  Since we sat at the bar I wasn't expecting good service, but was pleasantly surprised by how well the staff made sure we enjoyed our meal and had enough coffee and water. Granted, we got off to a rocky start as they ran out of clean spoons... yes, they were busy! But things were moving along much more smoothly once we got our food.   I ordered the Memphis Eggs Benedict which was made with St. Louis pulled pork and my sister ordered the Charlotte Eggs Benedict which was made with smoked salmon. We loved both our dishes, we basically licked the plates clean! They were so good! On top of that, I loved their hash browns! They are basically home fries but extra crispy, almost deep fried which is perfect for brunch. I really cannot complain about any part of my meal, it was that good! I hope to return back to Insomnia the next time I visit Toronto! I might even order the exact same thing again but hey, if it's delicious doesn't hurt to enjoy it again!"}
{"text":"Insomnia is one of those places that manages to do well as a dinner spot, a late night drink spot as well as a weekend brunch spot.  I've always enjoyed their food, which contains things like pizzas and pastas or the sort you'd expect to find at a College St restaurant.  It's a good place to go for a fun dinner with friends.  The service is good, and the atmosphere is cozy, so it really packs a 1-2-3 punch as far as a dinner establishment.  When it comes to late night drinks, I find it depends on how you're feeling.  If you're in the mood for a dark, loungy type bar, complete with the sometimes-too-loud music, then this is the place for you.  From time to time, we're all in the mood for that, but not always.  I must say that I'm not a big fan of their weekend brunch.  I find it to be over priced and not exceptional by any stretch of the imagination.  It's quite mediocre, actually.  They have these giant pancakes you can get that are an inch thick, but you have to wait 30 minutes for them to cook.  Just seems like an unnecessary novelty to me."}
{"text":"I went here for some appetizers and it was really standard. I was in the mood for some mediterranean style dips (humus, etc) and they had an assorted plate on the menu so we got it. It just wasn't very good. I would have had better food if I'd bought the dips at the store.  We sat at the bar and the server was really nice and friendly and made a decent martini off their low-priced martini menu. I guess I should have just stuck to the drink and gotten food down the street at Metro Supermarket to bring home. Next time!"}
{"text":"Have been here many many times over the years, and it is always reliably good. Not THE most amazing food that you will ever eat in your entire life, but a very solid \"tasty\", every time. The coffee is exceptional for restaurant drip standards : they secretly add cinnamon and that somehow makes it warm and special. The home fries with their ketchupy sauce are always a hit. I've never had a bad brunch here -  eggs Benedict or the French toast - and the sandwiches are also always good. Service is usually very good and they are great to let you overstay your welcome, although last time I went on a weekend a line had formed outside for brunch... Oh no! I hope that's a fluke and that it's not becoming too popular..."}
{"text":"I went for the brunch menu so this is primarily what I'm judging this restaurant on. All I say is amazing! First their home fries are delicious covered in some sort of ketchup sauce mash up that left me drooling for more. Warning: If you're not a fan of ketchup on your taters stay away.  I got the  Isabelle Benedict and even though I was apprehensive about the avocado I went for it and omg it was so good! First off they used a whole wheat English muffin, big points right there! The muffin wasn't soggy it was perfectly toasted and they actually got the amount of  hollandaise sauce right (so many places just drown the egg in it). Then they give you this side salad and even that was delicious, loved the sauce they used. I actually finished the salad first before I even touched my meal! Overall the meal was amazing, average price for brunch but definitely worth it just due to the portions and quality of the meal.  One thing I didn't like was their smoothie it was rather bland and not worth the price. Also I wish they had freshly squeezed orange juice. I know I'm just nitpicking here but for the price I could buy an entire litre of Oasis orange juice. Server was fine, wait was long (40 min) so be prepared, bring a candy bar or something because it gets busy and even though the place is a decent size it gets rammed!"}
{"text":"Daniel, the owner reached out to me after reading my previous review. I was invited to come back and try their menu again with a gift card offer. It was enough to cover my meal and drink/dessert. Definitely a nice surprise and generous gesture on his end as my last review was already positive. Lol.   I came here on Saturday at 11:30am with a friend and as expected, it was a crush. This place is POPULAR. I repeat POPULAR. Lol. Wait time was 45min this time but if you leave your number they will send you a text. So you can always pop over to Dollarama or Starbucks across the street to kill some time.   I had the Eggs Benedict - Charlotte again. Still a great pick and definitely recommend. Yum yum. I probably should have gotten a different dish but hey, I love what I love! Salmon is my kryptonite! This dish is pretty filling and tasty. My only slight issue was the eggs were cold by the time it got to me. A bit sad about that but kinda understandable because place was packed. Meanwhile, my friend ordered the Mini Traditional from their Mini Brunch menu because they weren't too hungry. Said it was good and hot but just wish they could have their meal on a bigger plate. More plate room was needed for the spreading of butter on toast! Haha.  I wanted to also try something new, so for dessert...I got the Creme Brûlée. The custard was good, but the topping could use a little work. My friend and I shared this and we both thought the topping was way too hard. I had to really press down to get the topping to break. Usually, you can just crack it with a tap or two of your spoon. So if they fix this, this dessert would be A-OK!  Overall, still a solid brunch place. Just note they do not take reservations after 10am. Online reservations has different cut off times. Anyways, next time I am in the area...I want to try their Heaven on Earth dish (french toast w/ berries, cream cheese, honey and maple syrup). Yelp pics make it look oh so tempting! Happy brunching!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Insomnia for a quick drink on Saturday night, but ended up staying until the end.   Our waitress was extremely attentive, yet not invasive. Never had to pour my own glass - the wine was always topped up.  A cheese platter was a nice touch.   Discounting a couple of minor service hick ups, which were ultimately resolved, Insomnia proved to be a great place to spend the evening."}
{"text":"I tried the stuffed french toast \"heaven on earth\" as they call it an it was soooo delicious. My hobby had eggs Benedict and it was so good also. I count the days to go back again."}
{"text":"Horrible experience here when a violent guest at the bar was continuously served alcohol and threatened my guests for sitting near him at the bar. Be careful on Tuesdays as the bar staff is reluctant to stop serving alcohol to some regular customers."}
{"text":"The restaurant was super busy on a Saturday morning! We were there for a birthday brunch, service was great!  Food portion was big for the price.  I had the avocado and tomatoe eggs benedit. The potatoes were amazing, crispy with a sweet sauce. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The best brunch spot I have been to. The food, the ambiance, and staff are always fantastic. Can't comment on the price compared to other Canadian brunch spots, but if you're from an expensive US city (ie D.C.), the currency conversion rates makes this brunch spot very affordable, borderline cheap, in comparison. I make sure to visit here every time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"A cool spot! I would come here with good friends that I'm not necessarily worried about impressing haha. The mushroom shepherd's pie was excellent. I got a salad that was decent. Service was kind of slow, they seemed to not have enough people for the volume of customers. Maybe this was an exceptionally busy night. Decor was very casual but comfortable, and they had some interesting sounding cocktails with a Toronto theme. I'm always a fan of that."}
{"text":"We got the French toast and three eggs Benedict. They were really good! Place is also v cute"}
{"text":"I'm not exaggerating when I say, if I opened my own bar, I would walk into Insomnia, take a bunch of pictures, and use them to duplicate every single detail (not like there's any chance of that happening :)  I don't think I've found a bar in Toronto whose decor I like more than theirs. The big brass draft tower, topographical shelves behind the bar, star lighting on the ceiling, and amazing warm hardwood floors really jive in a way that works for me.   I haven't eaten much here, but I have tried the Brie Crustinis (delicious, but not something to order if you're hungry), and their nachos. Oh...their nachos.  For the first time ever, the word \"Epic\" in the \"Epic Three Cheese Nachos\" name may actually be an understatement.  Full disclosure, I don't think I've ever been in a bar and not ordered the nachos, and theirs are solidly ranked #2 out of all the nachos I've tried. So much cheese, so many toppings.  Anyway, not a bad place to go if you're looking for a relaxed atmosphere, and some excellent food. Doesn't hurt it's in a great location, too."}
{"text":"As promised, I came back because I'm in town!! Had a cranberry mimosa and the Huevos Rancheros. SOOOO good, especially with the Chipotle and Jalapeño hot sauces. Homefries were amazing and even better this time around. The greens were not over dressed like last time, so they were perfectttt. Next NYE? ;)"}
{"text":"Solid 4 Stars.  Fried Calamri YUMMYYY, and the sauce that came with it couldn't have been better.  Steak They make their steaks a little differently then others, it has a very strong smokey flavour to it. This would come down to taste, if you like smokey flavour you will love this steak, if not then this won't be your thing.  Chicken And Waffles: These weren't bad but they weren't great either. The Chicken was fried fine and the Waffle was good too, but the main thing in this dish is the sauce, and the sauce failed to impress me.  The ambiance is great for a weekend night, slightly loud and mostly full of millenials."}
{"text":"Came for a friend's birthday, and I thought it was unique, considering downtown, that such a quaint and homey restaurant was capable of sitting a party of 15+. However, this was the only positive of my experience here. I got the small mixed greens & root vegetables salad, which was lacklustre in taste. There was no dressing, and I tasted only 2 pieces of butternut squash. It was not filling at all, and consisted of mainly only salad leaves. My friends got the Insomnia burger and it was a tiny burger that did not even come with a side! Considering the price of the burger ($14), I think it should be customary to include a side.   Other than the limited quantity and low quality of food, the service was horrible; our waitress was so rude! We thought it might be because of the fact that tip is automatically added onto the bill of a large party, as we saw her have a friendlier demeanour with other tables.  Verdict: Will not be coming back here for food. Better off to try other places in Koreatown, you'll definitely have a better experience."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's probably one of my favourite restaurants. The menu is huge and priced well, there's something for everyone! I always get the quinoa salad with a side of fries with garlic mayo and love every bite. The staff are super friendly and great with recommendations."}
{"text":"We came here on a Monday morning for brunch, so that's what we are rating.  The staff was friendly and we got seated right away, however we were a bit surprised by how dirty the pants of the waiter were, considering it was Monday morning.  The food came quickly and was okay, not extraordinary. We had a wrap and some eggs Benedict with the house potatoes. The potatoes were great but the rest was bland, nothing I need to have again.   With our food we ordered \"Fresh Orange Juice\" for 3.50$ and it sure tasted like Tropicana with Pulp.   Despite the fact that this brunch experience was a disappointment, this place looks like it could be nice in the evening. They have a nice selection of German beers on tap."}
{"text":"Stay woke for this place! Insomnia is hands down one of my favourites. It is a great place for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and for its nightlife (it closes at 2 am). It has unique offerings for a reasonable price. I have celebrated birthdays here, have had many brunch dates, and have gotten together with friends to catch up over a drink.  The service is great! The potatoes with their special sauce are to die for. There is a wide variety to choose from. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If your looking for a good breakfast/brunch place to start your day, this is the place to go! I really recommend it. The food was so filling and my family was really impressed.    I recommend anything off of the Egg Benedicts menu. You have to get it. My family loved it. The food can be a little bit of a wait but its well worth it. I ordered the Memphis Benedict which the meat is the bbq pulled pork one. It was yum. But I think paired with the home fries tossed in a bbq/tomato? sauce was a little over the top to be honest. But it was filling regardless. Just don't order it with fresh orange juice when eating the memphis, the acidity for me from the food and then the juice was way too much in the end. Your better off with coffee, water or hot chocolate when drinks are concerned in pairing with the dish but its up to you. And I also recommend the Macchiato as referred to me by my family member who loved it a lot.    This place gets really busy at a certain point and am glad we came a little early before the place started piling up with guests. They do reservations so I think its also good to book ahead for a table just in case.  Our server was polite so no complaints about the service. Poor guy looked a little stressed by the volume of people at the time we were leaving though.  Give this place a try and see how you like it. We will be definitely be back next time and perhaps try their lunch or dinner menu."}
{"text":"Loved this place! My friends and I came here for brunch on a Saturday and thank god we got there early! When we sat down and got ready to order there was actually starting to have a big line.   The food was delicious and so instagramable. :)  Definitely will come back to try more!"}
{"text":"Along this busy stretch of Bloor street west in the Annex Insomnia from Friday onwards is quite popular place for those venturing into this neighborhood and has always served it's local clientele for years.  Their menu, service, prices and ambiance makes this place popular.  Coming here for a bday surprise, our entourage were able to get a table at the back past the long bar counter and smaller tables. The environment lovely, spacious and intimate. For grub I decided to opt for some sweet potato fries, which were seasoned and portioned well. Other apps included their loaded nachos which was a delight as well. With a bottle of red it was just in time for some Prosciutto pasta, which was another hit, and something which I've had in my previous visit to Insomnia Lounge. I'll definitely be back again when in the area."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a MUST GO! My friends and I went to Insomnia on a Saturday morning for brunch. The decor was festive with lights and paintings for the holiday season. We first order mimosas which were awesome (pineapple flavor was my favorite). For my meal I ordered the 3 egg omelette and heaven on earth (French toast filled with cream cheese and topped  with seasonal berries) My friends and I agreed the omelettes we got here were the best we've ever had! The omelettes were filled with caramelized onions, sautéed mushrooms, and pesto. Yummm! Our waitress was also very sweet and timely with our meals and drinks. I had a great experience here and will definitely come back when I'm in the Toronto area"}
{"text":"Loved it! Thought it was a nice place for a date with the boyf.  The staff were also very friendly and great to have serving us.  A great atmosphere, different from many of the hum-drum eateries in Toronto. A must-visit. Already planning my return there soon!"}
{"text":"I really try hard to not rate hipster places low, because I know I'm probably mocked for not understanding the vibe of the restaurant, or something. But damn if the service at hipster restaurants doesn't always suck.  We were seated for a late breakfast visit (I guess that would be called \"brunch\"). We sat for several minutes and watched those who were sat after us be greeted. Insomnia also places water pitchers on the tables before anyone is sat, but ours conspicuously did not have any such pitcher. So between that and not being greeted for several long minutes, it makes me wonder why we were sat there. Oh, and the host like, was finishing a conversation with someone when we walked in and was half trying to exit the conversation but half still wanting to keep talking, so we had to stand there for a bit until we were greeted.  The server finally greeted us, which was great because we were hungry. Unfortunately, my french toast was extremely eggy. And I know, it's supposed to be that way, but it was eggier than scrambled eggs (not really). The french toast dish is called \"Heaven on Earth\". If that was heaven, I can't even imagine what \"Hell on Earth\" might taste like. My girlfriend has a tendency to order dishes I wish I had gotten, and the same rang true here. She got the peameal bacon grilled cheese dish, and it was well balanced, with cheese not overflowing put the sides of the sandwich. I hate when places LOAD cheese into their grilled sandwiches.  If I hadn't gotten a bite of my girlfriend's meal, this would have been a 1. Maybe you'll have better luck."}
{"text":"Great place with good drink selection. Came here on a few occasions and I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 8 and made reservations before. This is one of the brunch places in Toronto (along the subway line) that is open at 9 am.  I had the huevos racheros. Nothing special about the email other than the home fries! Their home fries covered in their special sauce is the highlight of the dish. The meal itself was alright - the side salad balanced the heavier side of the meal.  This restaurant does get very busy for brunch later in the day, but the servers are very friendly and do not push you to leave. The prices are decent for brunch and I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I came here with a groupon and had an amazing feast (their groupon is an amazing deal). Their drinks were yummy (especially the mojito), the food delicious (the cheese board was awesome!) and the service prompt and friendly. A special note about service: all the waiters were friendly and were joking with each other and with customers. I really appreciated their attitudes it looked like they loved working there. It made me happy to be there :-)   This is definitely going to be my new regular place for drinks!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to go here for brunch for quite some time and I finally got the opportunity today! There was a bit of a wait, ~15-20 minutes, but it was a beautiful day so we didn't mind. We were seated in some really comfy chairs, but it was a little bit tight in the back seating area. The food was great! I had the huevos rancheros and the other people in my group had different types of eggs Benedicts; everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food.   The only thing keeping me from giving this place a 5 star rating is the service. Our waiter looked like he absolutely did not want to be there and did not even bother telling us his name, ask us how we enjoyed the food/if we needed anything and did not even thank us for coming in. He gave us our receipts and just walked away. The other people in my group agreed - the waiter was very rude and made it seem like we were a bother to him. Pretty disappointing to be quite honest."}
{"text":"The food will not disappoint. Enjoyed my meal and the Ed's Vanilla Ice cream was amazing."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm a bit surprised at all the good reviews here. Maybe we just had a bad experience, but to be honest I don't think I would voluntarily come back here.  A few weeks ago my friend and I decided to have brunch here.  It was pretty busy on a Saturday morning so we were informed of a 30 min wait and the hostess took my number and said she would call when a table opened up.  That was nice b/c it meant we could wander around and do some window shopping while we waited.  Maybe it was that particular Saturday..but it was LOUD in here.  I couldn't hear my friend sitting across from me and had to ask her to repeat herself numerous times.  the brunch menu is nicely divided up into sections - if you want something on the sweet side, if you want a mini brunch (not that hungry or hungover), eggs section, sandwiches, etc.   When we finally had a chance to order (took a while) I chose the Pear Grilled Cheese - brie, cheddar, roasted pear, and it comes with home fries and a salad.  There were a few slices of pear and some sad looking cheese...and well...no taste whatsoever.  It looked like the black sheep of the grilled cheese family - all sad and hiding because no one wants it.  I can't even describe a flavour because there wasn't one.  It was just slapped together and looked falling apart and sad.  S.A.D.  I felt sad eating it. I feel sad even thinking about it now. The salad was overdressed and the homefries were meh.  I only finished half and didn't take the rest home.  My friend had one of the egg dishes (sorry can't remember exactly which one now) but she wasn't too impressed either.  Bland.  The upside was that at least the portions were big.    Maybe the dinner menu is better?  I certainly hope so because I see a number of great reviews for this place...but I can't...I just can't...go back"}
{"text":"We love Insomnia for brunch!   Their menu is great, the food is great, the service is great!   When we have guests in town we always try to make it to Insomnia.     There isn't much more to say than it's great for brunch at pretty much every level.  If you are looking for a great brunch place in Toronto, Insomnia is the place to go."}
{"text":"I tried Insomnia out with a good friend of mine a few weeks back and it is definitely a fun new brunch experience for me.  Although my friend and I had to wait a bit for a table, I could tell that this place is always busy (especially on the weekend mornings) due to the area and more importantly, the food!  As I was waiting, I breathed in the aroma of delicious brunch plates and eyed other people's food creepily as I waited.  Once my friend and I got a table, the waiter came immediately with a hot pot of coffee for myself, which was a nice rich brew, finished off with fresh cool cream and sugar.  For brunch, I ordered the waffle with bananas and chocolate sauce and my friend opted for the more healthy egg white omelette with veggies and feta cheese.  My waffle came fresh and hot to the table and the actual waffle was soft with crispy outsides. The bananas were cut into small circles with a nice drizzle of chocolate syrup and maple syrup.  I did get a taste of my friend's omelette, which had a nice balance of veggies and cheese. The eggs were cooked well and were not runny.  Our bill came to $28, so close to $15 each including tip.  I would recommend this place!  But one thing to keep in mind... If you want to order pancakes for brunch there, their pancakes apparently take 30 minutes to make because they make it completely from scratch and cook the pancakes in a special oven."}
{"text":"Great ambience from daytime into nighttime. They have amazing brunch which is first come first serve only. They might have the best steak and eggs in Toronto as they actually give you a good cut of steak and it's not too expensive either. Their brunch and night time cocktails are very good and not too expensive. Their late night snacks are decent however cannot give three stars due to a very lacking dinner menu. There isn't much to choose from there so not recommended for dinner but definitely for breakfast or a night cap"}
{"text":"Come for the Drinks! Their cocktails are boozy, and I can't remember the name of it, something \"bride\" but it had earl grey tea, with egg white.... Kept me happy all evening!  Why 3 stars? Because the service was sooooo slow... I think it took 20 minutes just to get our first drink, and by then I was super cranky. For food, I ordered the crab cakes, and on my first cut, the coating was just soaked in oil. It was greasy and really not appetizing at all.  Their menu looks like there are lots of other options, so it's worth coming back... And more boozy cocktails :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my top brunch places in Toronto. It is extremely busy on weekends and they do not take reservations. As with most other popular brunch spots in Toronto, you will need to come really early to avoid a long wait.   My favorite items here are their eggs Benedict. I absolutely love the home fries that it comes with. These home fries are covered in a sweet bbq sauce and they are just so tasty and perfectly crispy on the outside. The hollandaise sauce on the eggs are also very rich in flavor and creamy. I've tried several including the \"Manami Eggs Benedict- eggs Benedict on curried patties\" and this was probably my least favorite. This was different so I wanted to give it a try but I find the curried patties to be a bit dry. My personal favorite is the \"Memphis Eggs Benedict- eggs Benedict with bbq pulled pork\".   The portions are huge and the home fries definitely make the whole dish really filling. Insomnia have good eggs Benedict, great service, and reasonable price."}
{"text":"Damn, I love this place. This has been our favourite spot, because every time we go to guu ( or any other restaurant in that area) we end up here having cocktails afterwards. So far they managed to accommodate us, no matter how big our group was. Good service also!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Went in on a busy Sunday for brunch after being misled at Harvest Kitchen (they told us we'd be seated right away, waited an hour and then told us the kitchen was backed up for another hour). When the great people at Insomnia heard our story, they treated us to mimosas. Great food, awesome staff - wish we came here first."}
{"text":"Though I live in the Annex, I don't eat in the area very often, however Insomnia is one exception.  My sister and I enjoy going here for brunch and dinner, as both menus have some simple but tasty items.  As is the case with many Annex restaurants, Insomnia caters to the university crowd with it's loungey decor:  A few couches, chairs and low tables in the back, a couple high tables with bar chairs and then your basic seating and a bar.  Art by local painters, photographers, mixed media peeps adorn the walls and are available for purchase.  Swirly tube lights are suspended on the ceiling.  The restaurant features different \"themed DJ nights\" every night at 10 PM  but before that, your typical indie and alternative bands can be heard through the speakers- Radiohead, Franz Ferdinand, The Dears, pretty much anything I listened to when I was in grade 11.  Which is good.  It makes me happy and nostalgic.  Now down to the food.  I find the prices quite reasonable for what you get.  My faves are the Spinach salad ($9) which comes with sundried cranberries, pumpkin seeds and a raspberry vinaigrette. The grilled chicken or vegetable sandwich (both $9, all bread is baked fresh from Cobs) are great, and come with baby greens, fries and their delicious aioli for dippin'.  One suggestion for the veggie sandwich is to ask for the vegetables to be warmed up, as they usually come cool.  Cool!  I've never tried the pizzas, but their names are just adorable.  Depending on the topping, each pizza has a complementary name that's a different Toronto neighbourhood, such as the Danforth- tomato sauce, roasted garlic, grilled chicken, kalamata olives, roasted red peppers and feta cheese, or the Little Italy- olive oil, roasted garlic, prosciutto and asiago cheese.  Pizzas are $14-$15.  For dessert I recommend the Climax Cake, which is a flour-less cake, so it's a bit on the heavy side, paired with a cup of their delicious hint-of-cinnamon coffee.  Omigoodness there's still brunch!  I'll be quick, so here are my top choices: The Traditional ($10) The General's Special ($11) (Both of these have eggs/come with eggs, which I don't like, so these are usually my sister's choices) The PLT ($10) Like a BLT but with peameal bacon!  Even better! Huevos Racheros ($10)  I've actually never had it but it sounds really good.  I'll keep it in mind for next time!  Note:  Their homefries are not your typical potatoes or tater-tots, they come with this type of red barbequey sauce.  Not my favourite, but my sister loves them.  If you order a side sausage, it's a full-sized sausage on a plate. Hence why they are $3.50.  And if you have room for dessert, how about another slice of that Climax Cake?  Mmmmm!  Daily drink specials. Free wifi."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! We had eggs Benedict for breakfast on a busy Saturday morning. We were seated within a minute and there's water waiting for you on the table. We were brought coffee very quickly and our order came out literally withing 5 minutes! So fast! Their hollandaise sauce is amazing and those breakfast potatoes are to die for. Super recommend this place for breakfast. :)"}
{"text":"I cannot express how amazing the customer service at Insomnia is. And well everything.   After my last not-so-great late night experience, I was hesitant to come here again for last night drinks on a Friday but decided to give it a whirl anyways as I was around the area.   The manager reached out to me to apologize for the service I experienced on my last visit. To me, that shows that the business actually REALLY cares and I have so much more like for this restaurant. Maybe it's me, but I find that it is not very often that management takes the time to reach out to their customers and try to find ways to improve! A number one quality on my list.   Moving on, this place is super packed on Fridays. SUPER. But me and my boyfriend managed to get a seat at the bar (which is a great place for a party of two, woot). The bartender's service was totally on point even for a busy night. They were friendly and I should of got their names to thank them!  Anyhoo, I will definitely come back here for another night of drinks and food. And day as well.  I know I said there are a lot of places around Bloor and Bathurst. And there are. But the customer I experienced here goes above and beyond and for that, this is one of my fave restaurants to go to."}
{"text":"The service here was really great! It's a very cute place to eat, it's all dark with dim lights but the server was so nice! Our food came at a reasonable time, big portions and just great service! Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Loved the aesthetic of this place! I went here with my sister for brunch and it was packed. Was not too annoyed for we knew it would be busy but once we were seated, everything was great. My sister had the smoked salmon egg benedict and I had the crispy chicken sandwich. The chicken was so crispy and tender inside!!  Definitely would love to visit again! :)"}
{"text":"Reservations are recommended, the quality of food is consistently good, portions are generous. Great brunch spot."}
{"text":"I will definitely be returning to Insomnia. The food was very good, very tasty and rich. I had the chicken linguine, the chicken was very flavourful and the white sauce complimented it very nicely. The portion was generous. The ambiance of the restaurant was unique, muted and casual. Although the staff were pleasant, warm and friendly, I gave 4 stars because the kitchen was a bit slow. But all things considered we had a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"We come here for brunch occasionally.  The coffee has a hint of cinnamon and is really good. We always share an eggs Benedict (which we recommend and comes with really good potato wedges on the side) and a Heaven on Earth which is insanely good French toast with cream cheese, honey, and berries.  The food and service is really good.  There is a line up though so budget time for waiting to be seated."}
{"text":"Insomnia is one of the best restaurants in the Annex. I had my birthday dinner here a couple of years ago. The owner, Daniel Quintas, was very accommodating and polite!  The Eggs Benedict (no matter which option you select) are perfection. Other yummy brunch items include the honey roasted pear sandwich, heaven on earth French toast (aptly named) and mochacinno (perfect morning pick-me-up for those who are not coffee inclined).   Lunch and dinner items are yummy too! My favourites include the fried chicken sandwich (perfectly crispy chicken complimented by crunchy sweet coleslaw on a squishy milk bun) and the chicken linguine (the white wine garlic sauce is out of this world).  Can you tell that I'm working my way through the entire menu? :D"}
{"text":"Mediocre.  Went there for brunch and it really wasn't that amazing. It was a little more expensive than regular restaurants especially given the quality and their \"legendary homefries\" are just potatoes covered in glorified ketchup.  The mimosas however were delicious with lots of variation! Friendly staff and good service, just make sure if you're coming on the weekend you make a reservation as there was a long waitlist."}
{"text":"Insomia is a nice little restaurant at the corner of Bathurst and Bloor. It's a good place to go for drinks, or for food. I've been a few times and have yet to be disappointed with the service or the food served. Servings are quite large, and the meals are reasonably priced. (The Mediterranean platter is quite good, and well worth getting.) The place is dimly lit, with lots of small tables, which makes it a nice setting for a date as well. This place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"I was there for dinner. I like thier calamri and the Wahlnut penne Pasta.  Pro: good food. and nice ambiente. cons: it is quite packed place. And Parking is an issue."}
{"text":"Heaven on Earth ?? REALLY ?? highly over-rated and dry and no great shakes whatsoever. My friend RAVED about it, but then again, she knows NOTHING about food. She knows what she likes and that is IT.. The only thing that this \"dish\" has going for it is the fact that it is a  HUGE portion for the price and 2 meals (doctored up of course..) As is ? what a disappointment and so over-rated.   I'm a Chef, I know ALL ABOUT food."}
{"text":"So let's talk brunch.  I love it, you love it, the whole goddamn world loves it.  Why?  Why, it's the perfect social and gastrointestinal pairing!  It lets you sleep in.  It rouses you tenderly.  It brings sleepy and hungover friends together to stuff platefuls of decadence down their gullets, expecting nothing in return except the rest of your day, which will be spent in comatose splendor.  If the ethos of a Saturday morning could be personified by a meal, brunch twould it be.   Brunch does, however, have one glaring flaw, a question that is inevitably a consistent source of panic in our sleepy souls, and most brunch establishments sure as Shinola don't help:    SWEET OR SAVORY?!    It's not like you can go wrong settling on one side of the fence or another.  Eggs Charlotte, laden with smoked salmon and gooey-but-not-gross hollandaise over perfectly runny poached eggs, and accompanied by crisp, bbq'ed cuts of potato (home fries, I suppose, in some magical alternate universe)?  Chocolate-chip-banana pancakes which are essentially served in its own baking pan, to give you a sense of the dense, cakey texture?  Tasty huevos rancheros that a waitress once actually offered to refund my friend of it didn't \"rock her world\" (no refund necessary)?  All are bomb-diggity, all the time.  HOWEVER.  Insomnia has also ventured to solve our weary dilemma, and it is the aptly named \"Heaven on Earth\".  Two thick slabs of French toast, barely containing savory cream cheese dotted with strawberries and blueberries, and accompanied by a small, divine cup of real maple syrup.  Angels weep.  That's all I'll say.  Also, the waitstaff is uniformly attractive, the music is uniformly enjoyable, the white lights are uniformly classy, and you can sneak a Now into the bathrooms and read Savage Love while you do your business.  Now that's brunch done right."}
{"text":"I am never going back to that place again.  Service industry should be about serving customers, not treating them like idiots. Other than the service, food was a little worse than OK and was overpriced. My overall rating is 1 without hesitation.  First of all, bartender is more than sweet. She was really nice and positive, unfortunately service is not just about the bartender.   I went to Insomnia to have a nice brunch and study for a couple of hours. When I arrived, only seats at the bar were available and the waitress told me that I needed to wait for around 15 minutes for a table. So I told her I could sit at the bar and start eating, and when a table gets available she could move me. She said OK.   After 10-20 minutes, there was more than 4 tables available, but she wasn't moving me. So I called her and asked her if it was possible for me to move to a table now that they are available. She told me because I was only one person and the tables were for two, I needed to pay an extra service fee. She said she would ask her manager if she could move me to a table. Aha, policy changed in 15 minutes then? Or she didn't know about this when I first entered the restaurant?   I think it's easy to guess that she never talked to a manager or anything. She just ignored me after that.  I asked for the bill, (which was 17.50$ for brunch and coffee) paid and left to study at Starbucks.  If you want nice service, just walk for 2 more minutes and go to Future Bakery. Food is delicious, staff does't make a fool of you and it is reasonably priced. (6.50$ for breakfast+unlimited coffee for students on weekdays)  Never ever going back there again."}
{"text":"Brunch on a Sunday gets very busy, a reservation is definitely needed!!. Long wait for the food, but is understandable due to how busy it was. Mediocre latte but food itself-eggs Benedict (Charlotte) was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Good food and and fun dimmed light. My favourite dish would probably be the wild mushroom pasta."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Service was great. I ordered pizza, but it took a long time to arrive. I just thought it was because the kitchen was backed up as there were a lot of people. I  didn't really think too much about it because I was busy catching up with my friend. A server (possibly the owner or manager) came to us and without us having to ask, said that the first pizza they made was a little burnt and that they were in the process of making a new one, and will comp me for the pizza. He even asked if we wanted a comp appetizer to eat while we waited. We declined, but I thought this was one of the best service I've ever gotten because they were proactive and came to us without me having to ask!!! A+++  The food wasn't bad. I really enjoyed the chocolate mousse cake - a recommendation from my server. It was amazing! A rich chocolate with a hint of espresso. A must try!"}
{"text":"Good service, good food. The ambiance is really pretty, dark with Mason jar candles and Christmas tree lights that lit up the place. It's a quaint.  I went with my friends for winterlicious. We all got the smoked chicken taco, fried chicken and waffles and chocolate truffle cake for dessert.   This was my first time trying chicken and waffles. I really like the way the fried chicken was cooked but taste wise, it wasn't that exciting. My plate had a pool of sauce or syrup, while my other friend had maybe a drop or two. I think I would have enjoyed my meal with less of the sweet stuff. The waffle eventually got soggy and everything tasted the same and it felt like I was eating a meal of protein and bread soaked in sauce or syrup. Have I mentioned it all started to taste the same? I guess if you try this place, ask for less of that sweet stuff.   It's a big portion and definitely worth the money. I would recommend it to be tried, but it's not something special.   I haven't tried other chicken and waffles so I don't have any other experience to compare with.   The smoked chicken taco was really good though. If I were to go back, I'd order a full plate of that."}
{"text":"Heard plenty of great things about this place so my friend and I made a reservation on a Thursday evening. First thing we noticed is how cute and chic the ambience is! I love the lights hanging from the ceiling, the paintings on the wall and the dim lighting. The music isn't overly loud unlike most bars which was a pleasant surprise. My friend and I ordered a pound of honey garlic wings ($7 for half a pound which is about 4 wings, quite pricey imo. Also for some reason we weren't given any drumsticks, only wings lol), poutine, spicy chickpea hummus with chips and a few Steam whistles. ($6 for a pint). The poutine was wayyyy too salty and gave me a tummy ache. The wings were delicious and saucey and the hummus was great although the chips were a little stale tasting. Overall the food was great but definitely a bit over priced for the portions. The service was great too however our servers seemed to be super busy so didn't spot by our table many times (it took a while to get our bills). I would probably come here again for the nice ambience and drink!"}
{"text":"I'm contemplating my next trip to Toronto solely for this place!  I'll keep it pretty short and sweet. The wait was about an 1 hr and 20 minutes. If a brunch spot doesn't have a wait on a Saturday or Sunday - I advise you to go else where. The place is small but well decorated and has a warm vibe to it. The menu has a good offering. I opted for the waffles and standard eggs Benedict ( I split them both with a friend). I want to say that all of that was exceptional. The waffles were subtly sweet - seriously the perfect waffle batter in my opinion. My friend loved them too. The eggs Benedict was standard but not in a bad way. The egg was just right and everything just went together just right. One of my friends had a kind of baked pancake, not too sure on the name but that was also really really good and also subtly sweet and not overbearing.   The home fries were out of this world. So well seasoned and yet super crispy and hot. Overall I definitely recommend this place. We really appreciated the friendly service and just overall attentiveness as well. I can't wait to go back and have the chance to relive this awesome meal !"}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday party. I was ready to spend a lot of money as it was an occasion. I ordered a four tiered meal that they had on for a special. One of the things I ordered was a taco. The tortilla was cold and ripped on the bottom. I wasn't able to pick it up because of the tortilla and our server didn't come around at all to the point that I had to get up and bring it to the bar tender. The service was very poor. I wanted to order drinks but there was never a server around to clear plates or take orders. The place wasn't busy so I feel our server was just being neglectful. The food was good, other than the tortilla that I feel was also due to simple neglect. May try this place out again. It might have just been a bad day for that particular server."}
{"text":"i am a fan.  love their sauced fries, egg benny. Tried Heaven on Earth once, it was a good-looking dish, but just a little bit too sweet for me.  the staffs are friendly, but most of time, i wish they can check on us more often. there were so many times that you need to look for the waitress....  food tastes good!"}
{"text":"The word of the day is WOW.  I came here last Saturday night with a group of 8 people to celebrate my birthday. I was nervous because it being a small venue on a busy night, I wasn't sure how smoothly everything was going to go.  Luckily for me, my fears were put to rest almost immediately after we arrived. We were lead to our table which was a little crammed against the wall but it being a small restaurant, that's to be expected (my only worry was whether or not I would be able to maneuver the table with my cane, but everything turned out fine). Once everyone was seated, the bubbliest and most animated waitress I've ever seen came over to greet us.   She was so animated and proficient and really picked up on the small details: she remembered my name throughout the meal (small detail but one that meant a lot in a busy restaurant), when she heard my friends talking about an interest in the featured drink \"smoking gun\" she came back to the table and described it so beautifully that 3/8 of us ordered one (\"a hit of bourbon and when you breathe out it's like orange christmas morning\" ... uhm, yes please). She was always there when we needed her and she made our experience incredible. Thanks Bobbi!  The food was consistently delicious around the table. Everyone ordered something different and everyone was thoroughly pleased. I had the spicy tomato penne, and it was truly the perfect hit of spice with some nice cooling goat cheese to mellow it out. I was a very happy camper. Ditto for all of the cocktails; these folks behind the bar really know what they're doing! The cocktail list here is incredibly extensive and though everyone ordered something different (aside from the multiple smoking guns) everything was artfully prepared. At the end of the meal, the table was even given birthday shots, and they were delicious! Thank you! Beats a piece of birthday cake any day ;)  From the food to the drinks to the service, everything was more than I could've asked for. I can't wait to come back for brunch sometime, I hear it's delicious.  Thanks Insomnia!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start. I don't know where to end. I mean, it's just really THAT damn good. How you put pull pork with eggs benedict, home fries and make it legal? I don't know man. All I know is that this food was so damn good I was still thinking about it the next day. If you're in Toronto and you are real  bruncher, you have to go here."}
{"text":"\"ouu, that looks good!\"  What time we arrived/Wait time? We arrive on a Thursday night- late at night. We waited 10 minutes.  Atmosphere? The atmosphere was so beautiful and rustic. Loved the exposed brick and cute candles. The tables are a bit close together and you don't get a lot of privacy but it is a small space that is decorated nicely. It is quite dark and has a pub feeling.  Service/Staff? The waitress we had was amazing. She was so sweet and we talked about hair for around 5 minutes! haha.   Food/Menu? The menu was great. They had a lot of tasty looking items. We ordered the mac and cheese and it was so bomb. Loved it a lot. Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"I came back to try the brunch while my boyfriend was in town and it was a wonderful experience! We were both extremely hungover and the waiter struck a nice balance between making fun of us and nurturing us back to health with great Caesar suggestions and frequent coffee refills.   I am a huge eggs benedict fan and I love pulled pork, but the two together sounded really creepy. I couldn't resist, so I took a risk and tried the Memphis. It was awesome. I have never seen such a combination on any other brunch menu, which I tend to frequent.  My darling boyfriend had the omelette special which he absolutely raved about. I would comment further, but he poured ketchup all over it before I could try it -__-  tl;dr Have brunch here. If you're hungover, it will fix it and you'll love it. If you're not, you'll still love it.  PS The coffee is awesome! I tasted a hint of cinnamon or something of the sort. A+"}
{"text":"Really cool space & AMAZING food! We will be making this a regular stop while visiting the city."}
{"text":"Pretty good for brunch and just ok for dinner. I actually really like their coffee - the secret I found out is that they add cinnamon to it. I've copied them and do the same at home now.  I always find the place very loud."}
{"text":"Service was very good and food was delicious.  We will definitely return and will be sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"I came here with group of friends for my birthday. I gotta say I love the ambient they provided at this place. Very comfortable couch at the back, very imtimate and cozy.   They have food with good quality, drinks special every night after 10 pm. And let's not mention the fact with your student ID you get 20% off on food items."}
{"text":"Insomnia has such a cool, friendly and unique vibe. The staff are all amazing; very welcoming and fun to chat with. The OG Mac 'n cheese is TO DIE FOR. They also make great drinks, and have awesome suggestions for me always. Such a good time, every time."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I've only been here once, and on this once occasion I was not very impressed. The pizza, lauded by fellow Yelpers, was not all that, and even resembled some kind of (albeit, less greasy) deep dish Pizza Hut personal pan pizza.  However, I've heard the brunch is very good, and for that gave it an extra star in good faith."}
{"text":"I had hoped for a romantic brunch place - found Insomnia on Yelp under that category. Wouldn't say that about the place. The seating is uncomfortable - easy chairs with low tables - if you're taller than 5'3\" your legs will not fit under the table and you have to sort of lean in to eat. Very crowded place (at least on Easter morning). The food was just ok. We ordered the baked pancake, which was somewhat uncooked in the middle. The staff was very sweet to comp the dish and even replaced it with a set of buckwheat pancakes, which were better. But I also got an omelet which was slightly overcooked.  Their coffee is so so. I recommend getting an americano if you're a serious coffee drinker as the coffee is a bit week. The weight staff, was lovely, which is why I'm giving this 3 stars, but unfortunately we expected a nicer atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"I was in Canada for vacation (Civic Day) and came here before catching my flight back to the United States. This place gets packed, so I thought \"Hey, the food must be great\".  My friend and I got the Insomnia smoothie, and I got the BLT sandwich with home fries. This sandwich was amazing! I don't even really have the words, but I would eat it any day. The smoothie was sweet, but fresh, and nice and thick. The staff was also super sweet, and offered to stow my luggage while I ate.  Next time I am in Canada, I will surely make sure and stop by!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite brunch place. I have been here for dinner as well and it was delicious as well. Great staff, relaxing ambiance."}
{"text":"On the occasion I ate here I was thoroughly unimpressed. The ambiance seems to be a mix of crude hipster and \"oh hey I watched restaurant makeover\" we can do this on a budget! The food was overpriced and mediocre. Well mediocre for the price. I had a chicken bean quesadilla, which was soggy with grease, the chicken tasted reheated and the refried beans were canned. Mind you at taco bell I would have been raving this dish, however at $15 or so, I expect a little more out of my meal.  My friend had and let me sample, A butternut squash soup: I could taste the sulphides from the carton it was poured Followed by a walnut alfredo something: it was a bland but over salted alfredo sauce with some toasted walnuts thrown into it.  May it was an off day for the cooks judging by the other reviews but my experience was very unimpressive"}
{"text":"I went to Insomnia for brunch. The restaurant has a lovely atmosphere with a homey feel. We were greeted by a waitress and seated promptly as there was a bit of a wait (10 min wait). I ordered a pulled pork eggs benedict, waffles to share and coffee. The coffee had a great cinnamon taste which added another level of flavour. They also provide free refills which is always a plus. The waffles were soft, warm and delicious. Not to sweet at all. The syrup was warmed and complimented the waffles perfectly. The pulled pork eggs benedict was cooked to perfection, the egg was runny and the pulled pork was flavoured well with a great smokey taste. However the home fries stole the show! They are mixed in this great tomato sauce and taste delicious, not greasy at all. When I go to brunch at most places I don't finish the potatoes but this place is definitely worth it. A great place to check out!"}
{"text":"Randomly picked this place for lunch when I was in Toronto with some friends. What a lucky pick! The atmosphere here was super cool. The drinks were great and our waiter was very friendly. Our food did take some time to get to us but we did not mind, we were really enjoying Toronto and this hip little spot we found.  I had ordered a sandwich which did not come with a side which seemed odd to me but the sandwich itself was delicious. My friends very much enjoyed their stuffed french toast and salad as well. Will definitely stop by again when I am in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Find this one randomly. But he food is amazing. And i  can't wait to bring my hubby to try. The brunch is something new compare to the one we usually had in the hotel. Obvious will come back in the future. The food is fresh and the shop is always busy."}
{"text":"So you and a few friends decide to come here for brunch on a sunny Sunday around noon. Well, if you are prepared for a wait, you are in for a treat.  The tough thing about places with a line is that they seldom live up to the hype, especially after you have been out on the sidewalk breathing car exhaust fumes for a half hour. However, I really like Insomnia, the restaurant, for brunch and think it is worth the wait.  1. If you don't mind sitting at the bar, it is first come, first served. 2. The heavenly french toast (it does have blueberries and strawberries in it to offset everything else) is worth the 14$ price tag. 3. The vibe is cool and the crowd is young. 4. On a busy day, I found the service at the bar to be excellent. 5. Great coffee and Mimosas.  Brunch is probably more popular in Toronto than the Maple Leafs. However, many places don't quite deliver the full awesome brunch experience with creative and classic items, as well as good service. For me, Insomnia does."}
{"text":"Location: right in the Annex,less than a block away from the Bathurst subway station. Green P available in the area.   Atmosphere: dark, pub like however great for brunch, which is what I went for. Busy Sunday morning, small tables and not too spacious but cosy and nice.   Service: decent. Nothing over the top, regular host taking your name, waiter brings your food, checks up on you once, brings the bill. Oh and forgets my oj twice :/ but forgivable.    Food: DELICIOUS !!!! I ordered the Charlotte, first time and it was amazing!!! Poached eggs served on top of smoked salmon on an English muffin with Hollanaise sauce!! * insert drooling The plate included perfectly cooked potatoes with an interesting house sauce, salad and and orange slice for presentation.  This was definitely a meal to fill you for hours.  Well priced for the serving.   Fresh OJ for my drink was also a good size.   Overall, I most definitely will come back however make sure you go before 10:30 as the line up starts to grow after that.   Bon Apetite!"}
{"text":"I made an online reservation for 9am Saturday morning. Online reservation process was smooth and even sent a reminder the night before. We were promptly seated when we arrived and noticed that reserved signs were placed at every other table, which ensured we would have an empty table between each party if there were few walk-ins. The waitress was friendly and altogether lovely. We ordered a coffee to start and then the omelette with sausage and Heaven on Earth. The omelette was fluffy but there wasn't much sausage to justify the $2 surcharge. The side of greens and home fries were delicious though. The Heaven on Earth was good but not outstanding. I felt online reviews hyped about this too much. The cream cheese was rather firm and felt out of place in the stack. I'm not sure if it's worth the wait unless you have a reservation. Maybe the eggs bennies are better?"}
{"text":"This is a popular brunch/lunch option in the city, and I can see why!  Great menu options that cover the range of sweet to savory, multiple types of waffles and pancakes, plus a full bar for all your alcohol needs at 11am. I had the pulled pork eggs benedict ($14) on a waffle ($2 extra) instead of the usual english muffin . The hollandaise was lovely and rich but also light due to the amount of lemon it's been infused with. Eggs were perfectly poached and the pulled pork supplied the necessary savory base for the runny golden yoke. It was delicious and the perfect brunch item. Even the home fries were amazing, crunchy even when tossed in a great tangy sauce. I usually don't touch these but I ate every single one of them!  Be prepared to wait at peak brunch hours. On a Saturday, smaller groups had a 30min wait while large groups (like 8 ppl) had to wait for around an hour. Leave your number with the host and they will text you when there is a table empty, so you can wander around the surrounding shops as you wait. Even though it's a busy place, the service is friendly and doesn't rush you out. They come by to refill coffee cups but basically leaves you alone until needed. Also kudos on the great 90s playlist."}
{"text":"Thursday is Martini night. $5 drink and it is usually $10 ($6 for $11 Martini). Great atmosphere and romantic with candle night. This place can get pretty busy. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Came here for a surprise bday party. They sat us at the back which was good and intimate. Had the pizza and was not impressed. The crust was so thick it felt like I was eating a loaf of bread. The nachos were not bad and the same for the calamari but I've definitely had better. It was very mediocre. Wouldn't avoid it but would not make it a point to visit."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch joint!  Been here way more than I recall now, always a good time! Our usual go tos are Eggs Benny - tried pretty much all of them but Isabelle is my fave Huevos /tofu rancheros Grilled cheese The spinach Omlette  And the biggest reason we always go here: the potatoes!  Go early cause there's always an hour long wait if not more.... I wish they took reservations after 10 but sadly that's not the case. The good thing is they text you so you can roam around until your table is ready!"}
{"text":"The fact that I've never yelped this place is preposterous! I love this place so much. It's my \"old faithful\" brunch place. With new up and coming brunch places all the time in the city, it's a staple.  First of all, get here early! It's real popular, real busy and queues go out the door. Summer's are quieter and you can easily pop in. Fellow yelper, Matt M swear by making a reso and rolling in like a boss. I've never done it before, but will.  Why I love this place - they put cucumber in their water overnight, they make their delicious drip coffee with cinnamon, wait staff have always been rock stars. This place is a lean mean brunch making machine.  Onward to the food - pancakes are awesome and take a half-hour to be baked. I'm fond of the grill cheese on challah with a side of greens and potatoes. Carb on carb deliciousness!!  The potatoes... Probs what brings me back and what you've read all about on Yelp. Triangles of perfectly cooked goodness made with worcester sauce, ketchup and the who knows what else. So good! Go for the potatoes.  An amazing start to any weekend day is a delicious brunch here."}
{"text":"Best restaurant I've been to since arriving in Canada. I sat at the bar and had the best bartender ever. He was very knowledgeable about the food and the drinks. Made good recommendations as well. The background music was excellent as well. It tends to be crowded but the bar was open most of the time we were there. I ordered the pear grilled cheese which was fantastic. The side salad was so tasty and the home fries were scrumptious. I also shared a waffle for desert that basically melted in my mouth. I had the best mojito ever, sorry folks from Miami. This bartender was awesome. I love  this place and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ended up going there for brunch. The wait time they suggested was 1 hour but we only had to wait about 20 minutes. Ended up ordering the salmon Benedict and the portion quantity was great. The Benedict was perfect and the potato's were just awesome. However someone ordered pancakes that was pretty much like a big cake and I would definitely stay away from that."}
{"text":"Had the chicken honey lavender it was delicious, the vegetables were good also. The cocktails were ok. The environment was funky, the art work a little extreme for comfort and music was too loud"}
{"text":"Used to be a big fan of the place. The food is all really good, but the wait is a bit ridiculous. Memphis Benedict is good, home fries are good as well. All the same stuff as the rest of the reviews.  My complaint with this place is their gift card system. My gf bought me $50 in gift certificates - 2 $25 certificates - and when I tried to use them for our meal ($35), they told me if I use both certificates, I wouldn't get any change, or a credit for the remainder. So essentially, I had to either pay cash for a portion of my meal, or give a $15 tip. I asked the manager about it, he was short and rude with me, eventually telling me \"that's just how it works here\", and walked away.   As good as the food is, I'm totally put off of the restaurant after my shitty experience and awful customer service from their manager."}
{"text":"Oh my god. This is by far one of my favourite brunch places in Toronto. We came in with no reso's and were told it would be about a half hour wait... amazingly they take down your phone number and simply shoot you a text when your tables ready, so you are free to walk around and explore some shops before dinning. Why can't all restaurants be like that?! Not to mention the food is seriously insane.. in a good way. I ordered the Memphis Eggs Benedict made with chipotle pulled pork. Definitely recommend this and frankly anything off the menu cause it's all good! Also, whatever sauce they toss with the potatoes is to die for!! Will be back!! PS make sure you check in to get an additional $10 off!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice for brunch and I loved it both times. From their simple eggs benedict to their pulled pork and Manami (curried rice patties) eggs benny they never disappoint. Their heaven on earth is literally exactly as it sounds with massive amounts of fruit and cream cheese. 5 dollar mimosas during the weekdays that are also amazing. Also, the prices are very affordable. By the end of our student discount, mimosas, coffee, 2 eggs benny with upsells of manami patties our bill was 38 dollars. The service has never ceased to amaze me. Spot on every damn time and they fill up coffee and water as much as you need them to and are around to check on you. We might be a tad prissy but usually couches in restaurants are there for style and not comfort so we  didn't think the couches would be comfortable to be honest, but as soon as we sat in them the height and comfort was great for brunch. We'll always come back here!"}
{"text":"Insomnia seems to be one of those places where the ambiance and the people are the main draw, with the food coming in a very distant second place. And that's fine. The ambiance is indeed quite lovely, and the service has always been above average (in my experience).  On this particular occasion, we were a group of four that had shown up on a busy Saturday night without a reservation. Fortunately for us, a reservation had just been cancelled, so we were quickly shown to a table near the door (which got a little chilly every time the door was opened, but we certainly weren't in a position to complain).  We decided to share a couple of appetizers: Epic Three Cheese Nachos and Roasted Garlic Chickpea Hummus. After placing our order, however, our waitress helpfully pointed out that the nachos would probably be enough for a party of our size (noting that the hummus also comes with nachos). This was a remarkably generous thing for her to do and you can bet our tip reflected it.  Unfortunately, the Epic Three Cheese Nachos (\"Fresh Tortilla Chips, Cheese Blend, Kalamata Olives, Grilled Bell Peppers, Pico De Gallo, Salsa, Sour Cream, Guacamole\") were nothing too special. The platter sure looked impressive but a few bites in and I realized that they were more show than they were substance. There was just enough cheese to cover the top portion of the nachos, leaving the remainder dry and sad. The salsa tasted suspiciously (and prominently) like it came out of a jar, while the portion of sour cream and guac was wanting (to put it lightly).  But like I said, the food is secondary at Insomnia. It's a cool little hangout with well-priced drinks and unusually attentive staff, so I suppose on that level, it succeeds."}
{"text":"expect a brunch line! and no reso's  Their potatoes are to die for, their pancakes and waffles- AMAZING best place to take a date for brunch as long as you don't mind waiting a bit  :)"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while, but if I had to pick one last place to have brunch before I died, this place would be it. The home fries are legendary."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoy my nighttime dinners sitting at the back on the comfy couches relaxing and enjoying great food! Personally, I always order the mussels as they've been on the top of my list since I first started going to insomnia years ago. Their nachos are also something you shouldn't pass on. I've been so so many places that serve sad nachos but insomnia definitely knows how to do them right. The only thing that sometimes irks me about this establishment is the service - it's very hit or miss. There's been night where service is just non-existent. They will walk by you and you can try to draw their attention but when you do, it isn't guaranteed they'll remember what you've asked for once they're onto another task. Fortunately enough, my experiences have been okay but I've seen other patrons who have been flat out forgotten a couple tables down. Nonetheless, there is good food and if the service pulls through, it would be a great casual dining experience."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this review for a while. I went to this place in September of 2015 with some coworkers from brunch. The food was great,service was good, and the layout and ambiance were fantastic. The place is set up with coaches and chairs which made for a fun and casual brunch. I suggest trying reservations or expecting a wait."}
{"text":"Insomnia is one of the best bets for a fun night out in the Annex. Martini Night is awesome. The drinks are tasty, and they definitely aren't stingy with the alcohol (a huge bonus as many bars obviously cut back on alcohol on martini night). My exploration of this place has consisted of martinis, the cheese board, and the crab cakes (YUM), but the rest of the food always looks good as it's being delivered to other tables. They used to give out 2 for 1 entree coupons all the time, but I haven't seen one in a while... Aside from the food/drinks, the vibe here is fun and friendly. Servers are welcoming and not pretentious, which is a rarity when you go out for drinks these days. Check it out for yourself, I don't think you'll be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great place .. Tasty food and nice, and friendly staff ... the best service ever. I have came all the way from Detroit, Michigan."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem on Bloor st W. My friend and I were looking for a place for lunch and happened to stumble upon this restaurant. As soon as we saw the open windows and inviting atmosphere we knew we were going to eat here. Decided to have the prix fix brunch menu which only cost $18 for a great choice of food. I had the mimosa and the mix of pineapple and orange juice was splendid.   Very good for students because they offer 20% off to students during the week. Highly recommend. Service was nice although we were told we were going to hear the special dessert of the day multiple times but found out much much later. Pink velvet cake was cute and delicious.  They take debit and credit now! Still an amazing bar and has become my go to place with my girlfriends."}
{"text":"The 100th Insomnia review, yay!  Stopped by Insomnia for brunch on this lovely Easter Sunday with my sister. Originally we had intended on going elsewhere in The Annex, but our original destination was closed. We decided to go to Insomnia instead as it was close by - and let me say, boy, was I ever glad that the first restaurant was closed & we ended up here!  Arrived around 10:30 - though it was busy, still plenty of seating & we were seated without a wait.  I'll start off with the only kink in our experience here: the service. Our server was a total sweetie, but after he took our order we did not see him for about 25 minutes (I know this because I double-checked my check-in time on Yelp since I checked in just after our order was taken). At the 25 minute mark we did not even have our drinks yet. When the server came by the table beside us, we advised that we didn't have our drinks yet. He double checked and it ended up that he had forgotten to put in the ticket for our order. He apologized & the drinks were out to us very fast from that point.  Our food came about 10-15 minutes later - it looked amazing, smelled amazing, & tasted even better!  I had the \"Heaven on Earth\" french toast - they do not exaggerate! This is simply the best French Toast I have had the pleasure of eating in Toronto! It's stuffed with cream cheese, berries & honey. Perfect amount of french toast batter (I can't stand it when places over or under batter the french toast!) If you're a French Toast fiend like myself it is worth it to check this place out based on this alone!  My sister had the special - Eggs Alsace - poached eggs, hollandaise, sautéed onions, Dijon aioli, and chèvre - I had the pleasure of stealing some bites from her - delicious. The dijon aioli pairs very well with the sauteed onions, and the chevre is just delightful - it's a unique \"benedict\" as I don't think I've come across one quite like it in my brunch adventures!  In the end our server took 15% off our bill due to the delay & issues, we still tipped the full 15% though! The food alone was definitely worth it!  I will most certainly be back! I'm looking forward to checking out the Midnight Snack menu :-)."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a month. My favourite dish is Arugula salad and goat cheese and pear  with either grilled chicken or salmon. Always goes good with a glass of Sapporo. Never gets tired of it."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I don't know why but I'm always so pleasantly surprised by how good the food was. The first time was for a friend's art exhibit that he had displayed there. It was late, but the late night menu was great, really good service and such a nice atmosphere.   My second visit was also very memorable - hosted a client event for about 20 people during Summerlicious before seeing a play down the street and the staff was just so wonderful and accommodating. The service was so fast, they made us special menus and were so good with our guests. We didn't end up having time for dessert (our own fault, we were talking too much and ate too slowly) but when a few guests dropped by later to get their cars they wandered in to see if the restaurant would still serve them their forgotten desserts and they said yes, however they were totally swamped and unfortunately didn't have any tables. Just goes to show though, this place is the real deal.   The menu will have changed by now since it's been over a year since I was last there but the food was honestly SO good. Mini tacos, fried chicken & waffles, yum yum yum!! Check it out!"}
{"text":"I would honestly come back to Toronto JUST to experience this brunch again. Insomnia is this quaint restaurant on Bloor with the decor and ambiance to appeal to the cool and hipster crowd, yet intimate enough to dine with your significant other. Best brunch experience I had during my 4-day trip to the city. My friends and I were lucky enough to get the comfy seating in the back with the arm chairs. Before we knew it--we spent 3 hours there after eating our brunch, chatting, ordering drinks and trying a couple of their delicious deserts on the menu. On top of that--our waitress was AMAZING! Even chatting with us and giving us house shots to say \"thank you\" for being good customers. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a cool brunch spot."}
{"text":"I visited Insomnia for dinner on a Friday night. I made reservations a week in advance to ensure we had secured a table. I wouldn't recommend this place for dinner. The menu is average, boring and there were only 2 dinner specials. I had the special beat salad, and there was nothing special about it. It was beats and lettuce, and wasn't comparable to any beat salad I'd had anywhere else. My guest has the seafood boullabaise, which wasn't great either.   The wine list was poor - with very little to choose from, including no american wines on the list.   We had our meal and a drink each, and were asked if we could move to another table (we had only been there for 1 hour), because there were \"girls who were being annoying\". I'm not sure what that meant, but we had to move because there was a group of 6 girls who wanted to sit down, even though we had reserved a table. They offered us a round of drinks on the house for our inconvenience, so we agreed to move. They moved us to a table right in front of the door, where we were freezing and they didn't come take our drink order so we just asked for the bill and left.  I was surprised because I thought the reviews were so positive. But I don't know what all the fuss was about."}
{"text":"Cane here all the way from Ajax.Yea they're that good Great service and the food is amazing!Thinking about trying their dinner service but a must for Subday morning breakfast or brunch.Only one word comes to mind to describe this place...Delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent for brunch! Excellent service! Only Sunday morning with rap music like eminen (!?!?) I waited for 20min a table"}
{"text":"Today I was introduced to this magical creation called... A mocha.   Also I was told it is important to note that I am 28 years old"}
{"text":"I left the restaurant so disappointed. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, and incredibly inviting. The seating however... awkward. It's mixed with regular table chairs, high tables...but we were seated at the back in these sofa chairs.. incredibly low, different. But not the best seating placement when you're next to a group on a high table. Who wants that kind of view next to you while you're eating? At your eyelevel you have someone's bottom in your view, and at close distance. It's not pleasing. I guess this is probably the worst table in the restaurant.  Anyway to the food. We started off with the calamari. A staple appetizer. It was okay. The calamari was crisp, and not too greasy. HOWEVER. The dip, it was not tzatziki like the menu stated. We were pretty sure it was sour cream or plain Greek yogurt. Tzatziki should have flavour! Garlic, seasoning, lemon, cucumber. There was NONE of that. I was shocked.   I ordered the chicken and waffles. Wow was this a mistake. The dish itself looks impressive, flavours were there, unfortunately it's executed horribly... my waffles were incredibly soggy. This was probably due to a couple factors, the waffles are pre-syruped, stacked with the fried chicken and coleslaw which probably made it soggy... I've had chicken and waffles in other restaurants in the city and this is probably the worst. The saviour was the fried chicken, it's crispy, juicy and delicious.   The good points: My boyfriend got the mac and cheese. I'm allergic to cheese so I didn't get to try it. But he enjoyed it, and it smelled and looked delicious.   For drinks I got the 416 Mai Tai cocktail. The star of the night."}
{"text":"First meal in Toronto and obviously, it has to be brunch. Like I said, I've been warming up to brunch lately and Insomnia has definitely made me a fan. The cous and I met up on a holiday Monday and the place was packed.  Put your name down and they'll text you when your table is ready to go. The wait wasn't too bad, about 45 minutes, so we ended up getting a few errands done around the area.  The inside is actually really relaxed and homey, which I wasn't expecting. They even let you linger for as long as you want which you don't see very often, especially with places that are this popular. But it goes well with the vibe. The seats are soooooo comfy. Makes you want to lounge all day in them.  - Heaven on earth ($15.00) - the french toast is absolutely massive! Definitely lives up to its name. So light, fluffy and stuffed to the brim with berries and cream cheese. Awesome!  - Manami ($13.00) - those homefries are like crack; addictively good. It was our first time trying eggs benny with curry rice cakes on the bottom. All I can say is DO IT. Such a killer combo. Perfect blimp of heat in them too.  - Side kale salad ($6.00) - we felt healthy getting some greens to balance things out. The pine nuts added a nice crunchy element. Simple and refreshing.  Great first meal for me and I'd say it was worth the wait. Brunch game is strong over hurr."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been coming here for years for our anniversary, as this was where we had our first date. So already the sentiment is there.  The food is delicious, we have never been disappointed. We have tried quite a bit from the menu and so far the pasta has been our favourite. The sauces are delicious, the pasta itself is perfectly cooked and fresh, and the quantity is generous.   The cocktails are also delicious, and they have a good beer selection as well!  The only complaint is on the service. The waitresses are extremely friendly and helpful with the menu, but not very attentive. We had gone one time and talked to our waitress about our anniversary and whatnot, well later on she went to the table not 2 feet away from us and gave the two women free shots because she, \"loved them so much\". It's super sweet to do but should be done more privately as it made us uncomfortable. She just seemed so drawn to this table all night and really neglected ours, despite us trying to grab her attention for refills. Although I totally understand connecting with certain tables more than others, as I am a server myself, but it's important to be a little more discreet about it...especially when tables are so close together.   All in all we love it here, and will continue to come back! Great atmosphere, greater food. Something to be proud of for sure!"}
{"text":"One of the best places for brunch in Toronto, good prices and the portions will fill your tummy for sure :)  Highly recommend the heaven on earth: French toasts with strawberries, blueberries and cream cheese, Amazing"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and surprisingly they were a part of Summerliciious (Toronto's version of dineLA).  This little bar/lounge/restaurant is located in the heart of Koreatown.  My cousin and I both went with the Summerlicious menu and got the mini waffle, pulled pork Memphis, and the dark chocolate creme brulee for dessert.  All this food for a mere $18, what a steal!  The mini waffle was just a simple quarter of a waffle to start with chocolate and maple syrup, the syrup being more liquidly than anticipated, but still sweet and good.  The pulled pork eggs benedict was delicious and full of flavor.  I've had many eggs benedicts in my lifetime, but this was a first with pulled pork.  It was savory pulled pork on an english muffin topped with a poached egg and hollandaise sauce.  It also came with a side of greens and potatoes smothered in a sauce which was a bit too saucy.  Lastly, we had creme brulee which was absolutely the best creme brulee I've ever had.  It wasn't sweet and wasn't eggy in taste, but just the perfect texture and taste.  They have a very extensive menu of lunch and dinner items, a full cocktail list including various liquors and wines, and a late night snack menu.  We were seated on their couch seating area which was pretty tight and you'd be sitting elbow to elbow if it were packed.   Service was very friendly and our food came out relatively quickly at the beginning, but the dessert took quite awhile to come out.  We even noticed that another party of two that were seated after us, ate their three courses and got their check before we were attended to.  Parking on the street, metered."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Cinnamon coffee was just incredible. Not overpowering but subtle enough to notice it.  I had the huevos Rancheros with a side chorizo sausage......I want a lifetime supply of this to take home with me to Ottawa :)  This is a must for me every time I'm in town, can't wait for my next trip so I can have this outstanding breakfast!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast this time and it was great! ordered the glazed pear and brie grilled cheese. The sandwich was delicious (though it might have sat under the heat lamps a little too long because it was looking a little deflated). Their famous homefries are smothered in what i an only assume is a spiced ketchup mixed, a little too much for me, but still delicious. The salad included with all of this was a nice fresh touch.   The prices for breakfast are quite reasonable, and the ambiance is top notch. It's quite busy, so either come early, or come with a small group. Our server (I hope this is the right word) was incredibly friendly and super helpful with recommendations on what was good. I will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Despite not having a reservation on a weekend, the wait was super short and they text you when your table is ready. The decor was gorgeous. I recommend the General PLT. It was perfection."}
{"text":"Great vibe. This place is literally ALWAYS LIT! I've taken literally all of my friends, my family and even my grandma. They have high quality food, nice decor, well priced, sweet service and great events. Additionally, they used to have a deal going on where if it's past 10pm you could get any food item with the purchase of a pint. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Excellent!! From our waitress to the management, we were treated with so much appreciation and respect. Great customer service. I went with my newly fiance' (engaged that night) and when we told our waitress she congratulated us with celebration and jubilee. Then the management offered us a couple glasses of champagne on the house!! Very generous. The place is real quaint and cool. I like how its dim lit. Great date place. We were also impressed by the food. The Chicken Linguine. 5 stars!! im a foodie, its hard to impress me usually, but the pasta was cooked to perfection. the sauce was rich and savory. The tomatoes added a bit of acidity and sweetness that the dish needed. The perfect dish to end the perfect night. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I am usually not a big fan of brunch but came here with several friends that had been raving about the place for a while. There was a huge line up so we had to wait for about half hour (reservations were not possible). It's a popular place so be prepared to wait.  Despite the fact the restaurant was packed and busy, waiters were super friendly and service was quite efficient.   I got the traditional breakfast with sausage and X-Rated vacation martini . Portion was a decent size and food was delicious (especially the home fries,I can just eat a whole plate of those). The martini was amazing-not too strong,but not too sweet either. Could have been a bit bigger though.  Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The hype of this place started when i first came here almost 2 years back and it was insane. i fell in love with the ambience and the decor, as well as the service and the food. Back then it would've been a 5 star guaranteed but now... it's an average 3 star.  Service is still on point, decor and ambience is still gorgeous but the quality of the food deteriorated. Ordered a mint tea with florentine eggs benny and let me tell you... I was disappointed.   The best part of it was the tazo mint tea from a tea bag, and the side salad from the benny. The potatoes were like cardboard... I use to love their potatoes and it taste good but the texture was just excruciating. Felt like my teeth were going to fall off and let's just say the actual benny was kinda of flavourless. The poached egg was cooked to perfection but taste overall was lacking."}
{"text":"I was here for dinner on a Monday night, so it wasn't busy, yet the service was more than terrible. The host was miserable - I don't think she spoke to me and she definitely didn't smile. I waited for 20 minutes before asking a passing server if I could order a drink and the guy at the table next to me had been waiting longer. When she did bring my drink, she brought the one wrong, gave the guy at the next table the wrong one as well, and then didn't bother to ask my now arrived companion if she could get him a drink. It proceeded to go this way the rest of the evening - mix ups and confusion. My companion and I each had a sandwich of sorts which were only mediocre. I give this spot one star for the atmosphere and its tasty sweet potato fries. Don't go here."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, but it's been a few years. It's a reliable kind of place to eat. Like when you're not sure where to go, can't think of anything in the area more exotic, and are just hungry. I intended to go for brunch this past Saturday, but missed it. I think it ends at 3 pm, like most places. So I was left with the lunch/dinner menu. I had the grilled vegetable sandwich with eggplant, zucchini, mushrooms, roasted red pepper, and hummus. Homemade hummus, too, I think. It's a hefty sandwich, on foccacia, and I had a side of sweet potato fries and a green salad. It was good. It was satisfying, and I didn't feel like $9 was over priced. In general I think the menu is priced well in relation to the portion sizes. I would recommend this place to the average eater, and anyone looking for a trusty meal."}
{"text":"Very yummy brunch, very fast and great service! We were lucky to get two seats at the bar, as this restaurant fills up quickly. I had the huevos rancheros and one of their $5 mimosas with cranberry juice. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Been here many many times for brunch, mainly just to eat the homefries which are the best I've had anywhere. I usually order the eggs benedict or eggs manami, both delicious. Only downside is it gets really crowded for brunch usually, and there's a wait."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I found Insomnia on an article by the Thrillist on best food in Toronto and decided to make a reservation for a New Years brunch.   The bohemian, artsy brunch restaurant was packed when we got there at 10:00 am so definitely make a reservation if you plan on going to Insomnia on weekends or holidays.  I ordered the Insomnia smoothie ($5) which was a yogurty blend of strawberries, bananas and oranges. Perfect drink to start my morning with! I ordered the Mini French toast ($7) and a side of home fries. The french toast was thick and so delicious! The Canadian maple syrup made it taste all the better. Their home fries are your traditional breakfast potatoes doused in a house ketchup bbq sauce.   My boyfriend ordered the Eggs Benedict which is their most popular item on the menu. The poached eggs were coated in a cream sauce and served with a side salad and home fries.   We enjoyed our meal so much that we went back for brunch on our last day. Our second visit I ordered a half order of waffles (only because they were out of challah bread for the french toast) and my boyfriend ordered an omelet (also served with a salad and home fries) and a side of andouille sausage. Another delicious brunch!"}
{"text":"checked out this place yesterday with my mum. We ordered Isabelle replaced the toast with waffles, it was not bad. And the french toast!?, which is kink of feature of their brunch menu. How French Toast could be bad like that, this is ridiculous ! The french Toasts were made not only l'air two piece of brick but to ingest. Definitely not the French Toast mean to be.     Fortunately I ordered the  mini(portion) french toast instead rashing out their HEAVEN ON EARTH."}
{"text":"During second time, my friend and I are very enjoy their brunch much better than last I visited. I will coming again just too hard to book N waiting too time for walk in."}
{"text":"I used to love Insomnia, what on earth has happened to this place? We went in the other day to eat and were given the most medicore food with bad old lettuce for salad. I used to love coming here and eating grilled calamari and now the menu has completely changed.    Service was good, I won't fault the server for bad food. Very disappointing will never recommend this place to anyone nor will go back there again."}
{"text":"This is a great place with energy and atmosphere. The waitress was sassy and professional which added to the pleasure. The food was flawless. Well proportioned and perfectly cooked.  If you are in the neighborhood and want to feel young and be well fed this is a great place for you."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for brunch on a Saturday in Toronto... The lineup was out the door for good reason! I had the 3 egg omelet which had mushrooms, spinach, onions and pesto... Delicious! And the assorted greens and potatoes with sauce were nice sides. My buddy had the Memphis Eggs Benedict (with pulled pork) and was not disappointed! Staff were friendly and attentive... I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a friend last week and was pretty happy with it! Didn't know what to expect (she suggested it, we were looking for something located mid way between our offices) but first thoughts on walking in were that the decor/lighting was really nice, and I liked the atmosphere - seemed chill and it wasn't too loud.  For dinner I had the vegetarian wrap, which was huge and great value at $9. There wasn't a TON of flavour but I was also happy it wasn't full of sauce so overall good. We also split fries as well as dessert (waffle dish) which were both good. Service was friendly and attentive. One other thing to note, it felt like it was a million degrees in the restaurant, but our server mentioned the AC had broken that day so it's probably been fixed by now. Overall a nice dinner and would like to go back to try the brunch!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 4 for 5pm. We were seated at the very back on the very uncomfortable red sofas (nearly impossible to eat while sitting on them - or get up and out as they're very worn). Service was great - food was excellent. We had the chicken and waffles (two of us), the burger (one of us said it was excellent and cooked to well done as requested -- this request is sometimes ignored) and a salad with crab cakes. We loved it all -- the food (and fries!) were delicious.   Switch out the uncomfortable red sofas/chairs for proper tables and you'll have zero complaints and this would have been a 5-star review!"}
{"text":"yAs waited for like half an hour for Sunday brunch in insomnia but totally satisfied! The Memphis bene is worth dying for! The cake is beautiful but too sweet for me! Will come back soon love it"}
{"text":"A friendly and accommodating staff, delicious food and fantastic saucy potatoes. Highly recommended for a hung over brunch or as a good place to start drinking. Always a pleasure. Go for the PLT!"}
{"text":"I like the food, especially the brunch, but it's almost always too loud and crowded.  I know it's the Annex, but I kind of feel like they're trying to cram just a few too many tables in..."}
{"text":"Food has always been consistently good and servers have always been friendly/polite. Has a trendy vibe-- definitely suited to its neighbourhood. I dislike how crowded seating is, but I do understand that it's a pretty popular restaurant. I don't like their \"your whole party must be here for me to seat you\" policy, which was enacted once during brunch. I was alone, waiting for my friend, so not seating me for a party of 2 seemed a bit ridiculous. Otherwise, a solid place. Love the $5 mimosa deal. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I pass by this place frequently and it's usually busy. With that and the reviews it's been on my list of places to try.  My pals and I didn't have reservations (Friday after 8p), but fortunately there was bar seating, and despite the 45 minute wait time we were advised a table opened up in 15. Sadly, upon being seated it took 7 mins for our server to finally arrive.  I got the Diva martini which was delicious.  I find fruit flavored martini's to be a bit artificial tasting and strong, but based on the description I gave this strawberry flavored one a try.  It was great. One of my pals got the Lychee martini and really enjoyed it.  Having already eaten (2hrs prior), I just got a 1/2 pound of the garlic honey wings. There were only 4 wings...!  They didn't look very big, but I guess they met the weight requirement.  Anyway, I wouldn't get them again.  It was extremely saucy/wet/dripping and the flavor was only okay.  I honestly didn't get the honey or the garlic (flavor).  That all said, the experience was fine and so I would return for another try."}
{"text":"Really good brunch place, great ambiance, the uniqueness of this place is definitely something to experience. Customer service was very good and most important the food was absolutely delicious. Mimosa was a great addition to the meal."}
{"text":"Tried this place for only lunch and brunch, and all times its been great food."}
{"text":"It's been quite a few years since I've been to Insomnia and my friend suggested to come here for brunch on Saturday. She warned me it would be packed and was it ever! We were there around 12 and the wait was about 45-50 mins. The hostess said a text would be sent so we went next door for coffee. After it hit the 45 min mark I had to follow up and we were able to get our table. All of us ordered Bennies - St Albain (Peameal) and Charlotte (Salmon). I like how balanced the meal is as they give you potatoes and salad as well. Eggs were poached perfectly and their coffee was good (it has some sort of cinnamon in there).   Service was good. The only comment I would have to make is they forgot my friends dish. 3 of 4 came out and the server said the 4th was coming out but we waited 5 mins and by then the rest of our food was kind of getting cold since we didn't want to eat without her. They kindly took hers off the bill. I also asked for hollandaise on the side but they end up putting it on my eggs. Other than that it was a good brunch experience. Since it's been awhile, I'll definitely need to come back to try their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Best brunch place ever. Will definitely come back when my bf and I visit Toronto again."}
{"text":"After scouring the internet for a brunch place, we finally settled on Insomnia. We were being particularly picky since we're just visiting and didn't want to waste a meal on somewhere mediocre. Insomnia got some rave reviews, so I went ahead and placed a reservation.  When we arrived, we were seated somewhat promptly by the host. Though he had to take a moment to disengage himself from a full-blown conversation with someone behind him. Once we were seated, we waited for a server to come by to drop off some water and get our drink order. So we waited. And waited. And waited. But we were ignored for over 10 minutes. AT LEAST.  During our wait, we noticed repeatedly other people (who were seated after us) getting served. This was a tad bit aggravating, as we also noticed our table was also the only one without a pitcher of water. Literally all tables (empty and occupied), except ours, had a pitcher and glasses. We had nothing.  The server eventually came over to greet us, but then we had to ask for water. We went ahead and ordered our food because we had no idea when the server was going to come back, if at all. I went with the Peameal Bacon Grilled Cheese. I actually liked it quite a bit. They didn't overflow the sandwich with cheese.   I also asked for no sauce on my potatoes, since the sauce didn't appear to my cup of tea. Plus, I don't taint my potatoes with sauces like ketchup and BBQ sauce, which is what many other reviewers referred to the sauce's resemblance to be.   My boyfriend went for the Heaven On Earth. He hated it. And I get why. I had a bite, and the best way for me to describe the dish was that it was like eating a sweet omelette. It was just way TOO eggy. Utterly disgusting.   The food and service combined with the visit being an hour and a half, I wouldn't recommend Insomnia to anyone on a time limit or likes decent French toast.   Overall: 2/5 Food: 2/5 Service: 1/5 Atmosphere: 1/5 - Tiny, tiny tables. I hate when restaurants do this to maximize space. They sacrifice diners' comfort for their profitability."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Excellent food, amazing drinks menu.  The staff are also very accommodating of food intolerance and do their best to help.  I always feel welcome at Insomnia, so it's a great place for celebrations or just kick back with friends.  Long lines for brunch on the weekend though, so show up nice and early if you can! :)"}
{"text":"I liked the setting and atmosphere. But, the servers had attitude and the food wasn't even that good. I attended a birthday dinner and my partner and I ordered the sausage/olive pizza and beef bourgonion. The pizza was like the frozen Delissio kind that you can just heat up at home. Too much cheese sauce and not enough sausage. The beef bourgonion was great and the portion was huge but it was overpriced. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is (rightfully) bananas on weekends, so I try to do weekdays, but reservations help and they have a pretty good wait list system going for brunch times when they don't do reservations.   But such. Great. Brunch. Fave for sure are the potatoes that basically taste like bbq chips. Somehow all sauced up, but still crispy.   Egg things are all good. And LOVE the curry rice patty thing for the gluten frees in your group. They also often have special eggs bennies like Thanksgiving style... Worth the calories.   Absolutely a regular here."}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch.  Their Heaven on Earth and Eggs Benny are both delicious.  My only qualm is that they are so busy!  But that's great news for them.  I try to eat here at least once every few months when I catch up with old friends."}
{"text":"I loved Insomnia for brunch during my time in Toronto. We came with a pretty large group to Insomnia with no reservation, and within 20 minutes, the host was able to accommodate us. Our food was amazing, from the huevos rancheros to the salmon. We also ordered a few drinks that were just as great as well. The only hold up for me was that the servers were a little slow in getting to our food and drink orders. Otherwise, I had a great brunch here!"}
{"text":"Went there for brunch at 9:45am. Make sure you have reservations. We had reservations made through Yelp and that made a difference. There was lots of people lining up. The service was also very good. Our friend had the french toast, a little too much cream cheese to her taste. I had the Huevo Rancheros, it was amazing. Our daughter had mini french toast, she did not really like it and ate our delicious home fries and had extra orders of turkey bacon. Even though there was a long lineup, we were never pressured to hurry or leave. We did not complain about the french toast but the took it out of the bill which was a nice touch. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The 5-star rating goes to their home fries! If you're getting something that doesn't come with them you need to get a side order.   The omlette is fantastic, flavourful and perfectly cooked. Their seating is spacious and we went on a Monday afternoon which meant there wasn't a wait. I can imagine they get stuffed up for weekend brunches so I would try to get a reservation.   There really is no need to write more. ORDER THEIR HOME FRIES.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It was Insomnia that introduced me to the word \"brunch\" 2 years ago, so I have to say, thank you so much!! ;)   Food:  -the Sun Salutation -$9: I admit, the price is quite steep for a simple dish. But nonetheless it was delicious but just a tad sweet in my opinion. The fruits and honey were already sweet enough, I didn't think the raisins were needed.  -Isabelle -$13: Of course the egg benedicts were spot on, and slathered with a yummy Hollandaise sauce. The homefries aren't your normal fries, they are baked potatoes and covered in their \"Legendary Sauce\" without them being soggy. I have no idea what the sauce was, but it seems to be a ketchup based sauce? They were soooo gooood and I would definitely come back here just for their homefries. The mixed greens were lightly dressed with a vinaigrette, very refreshing and lightened up the dish! :) Unfortunately I don't think my muffins were toasted, they came out cold and too chewy for my taste.  -MANAMI - $12: The curry rice cakes were the spotlight of this dish! It's like the chef got some leftover curry rice, did some magical thing and boom, flavorful patties were born :D. You can substitute your bread with this for $2 and I would take the curry rice cakes over the english muffins any day! Other than that, the egg benedicts were perfect again, the Hollandaise sauce wasn't too heavy and had a hint of citrus. My friend also got a side order of peameal and I wish the waitress would have asked if she wanted to incorporate it with the egg benedict, as it looked quite sad like that on the side lol but oh well, it wasn't a big deal.  While the wait at Insomnia was quite long, I would say the wait was worth it! The restaurant have great brunch options at great values, the servers are friendly and efficient for a really busy place. Apparently I heard their pancakes are delicious so I can't wait to come back! If you are around the area, definitely give this place a try as it is a solid brunch spot in downtown Toronto :)."}
{"text":"Best restaurant for some authentic amazing chicken and waffles!!  Drink are overpriced but the food is amazing nonetheless!!"}
{"text":"GUU down the street closed at 11:30 so we decided to come to insomnia, the hole in the wall that we always thought was a sketchy bar. The place is a hidden gem!!! I was with Austin L. here on a Tuesday, the special was tequila shots and krombacher, we didn't have any. I had 2 lychee martinis and he had a bourbon sour. There drinks are absolutely delicious (at least the lychee was), I had to stop myself from ordering a third and having to be lugged home like a potato sack.  I came here for the caprese salad, it was amazing, but then again I do like myself a caprese salad anywhere.   The service was great, it's a very chilled restaurant, it didn't seem to have a staff uniform. I loved the corner couch spot we were in, actually I loved the fact that this place had couches. It's just such a cozy little place, we want to make this our new go to place for late nights. The food is just so good (except for the deep dish pizza, I didn't like how the crust looked store bought), if write a review just for food I could write an essay.  We love it here! I have to give 4 stars because there's always room for improvement! **larger martini glasses**"}
{"text":"Open until late... We came last August 2015 and I forgot to post about it. We came back again and it was just as memorable as before. We sad in the back. Hubs was big for the seating (6'4) but he didn't complain. We vibed to Kaynes new albums an drank wine..."}
{"text":"The best for brunch. Insanely great food and service. Huge portions, but also have lighter options. Don't even get me started on their hash browns...."}
{"text":"After checking out the brunch menu online, I was convinced this would be a great place for brunch. Girlfriend called the restaurant to try and make a reservation but was kindly declined as brunch was on a first come first serve basis. Far enough. Arriving at the restaurant we were more than shocked at the lineup! We waited around 45mins but as we waited and watched the diners devour their food, it only built on our appetite.   Was seated after and seeing the menu before head I couldn't hold myself back and placed my order for the Memphis Benedict with an extra sausage. Good arrived quickly and looked amazing. Benedicts were made to perfection and was real savoury. The home fries with the legendary sauce was delicious. Sausage was jooocey. As I maul down my plate of food, it became justified as to why the line ups just seemed to never end."}
{"text":"The most amazing chicken and waffles I've ever had. Would come again just for that, but do want to try the rest of their menu. Very cozy place, with couches in the back, and high tops. Their drink are also delicious and worth the average 15 CAD."}
{"text":"Just like many hot brunch restaurant in Toronto they did not take reservations. We did not wait longer than 15 minutes to get a seat which was pretty reasonable. I personally did not like the kiddy tables that we were seated on at the back of the resto. I get it was \"cool\" but along with the place being busy and so crowed to the point the waiter kept bumping and dropping stuff on the floor the mini tables and seats made my eating experience a bit uncomfortable.  They had a good selection of interesting items to choose from the menu. I couldn't make up my mind as they all seemed so good! I ended up getting the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict. Everything was delicious including my champagne pineapple mimosa! There secret green hollandaise sauce was alight but still good :P (sorry!) it tasted like regular hollandaise sauce lol The saucy home fires were good mmm. I think I over ate them because I couldn't stop eating. It was a hardy brunch which resulted in me napping soon after LOL. Oh! And my waiter looked like Rollo Lothbrok from Vikings :D"}
{"text":"Such a great brunch spot! We had to wait about 45 mins but it was fine as it's conveniently located to grab a coffee.    My best friend and I went today and both ordered the Isabelle but added pea-meal. The avocado was perfect and the tomato grilled. The hollandaise here is so good! And the home fries!!! What is dat ketchup home-fry heaven?   Only downside was the volume. It was so loud but I understand it's because it's so popular! Overall it was Really great - We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place and very accommodating. We had a birthday function with around 30 people and they took great care of is and even hid a huge present (sewing machine) in the back for us.   Drinks and food were great. Ambience was fun. Service was great.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and dinner. Great staff, great food with gluten free and veggie friendly options. I will keep going back."}
{"text":"Nicole with a great smile served up a great Sunday Brunch in a full house after the Run for the Cure. A dark roast with a touch of cinnamon smoked Salmon and St. Albans Benedict's hit the spot. Use your Yelp app and u get $10 off your food bill. Tip her well she deserves it!"}
{"text":"I have been on a Egg Benedict marathon for weeks now. So far I have to say Insomnia's egg Benny is quite impressive. The eggs are cooked perfect, the sauce is delicious (see the little dills in it!!), the English muffin is toasted to its perfection. It is crunchy and soft at the same time. Excellente!! And the home fries is very good, this is the first time I would finish the home fries and probably lick the plate after, it is delicious. The salad is not over dressed, love it! The coffee has this cinnamon aroma to it plus it gives you fresh cream, lovely. I will definitely will return to try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"I went to brunch here. The line was a little long but the eggs benedict was really good. I would go back again."}
{"text":"let me just start by saying we sat at the bar for brunch and the bartender was awesome, very attentive, and friendly! honestly would rather sit at the bar then a table because I am close to the coffee, water, and booze :). the coffee was infused with cinnamon and DELICIOUS! I even asked the bartender about it and that's when she let me know about the cinnamon...  when it came to the food I loved the potatoes and loves the salad, but for some reason the eggs Benny sauce had no taste... and my English muffin was soggy. so not really enjoyable because there was a neutral flavour. the pancakes were yummmm! just know they are the thickness of a piece of thin cake, so aka SUPER THICK pancakes!!! could do w more syrup!!! were a little dry but still yum."}
{"text":"Meh.. I'm a little on the fence about this place.   Went here with some friends to celebrate a birthday. The atmosphere is very hipsterish. (At least to me)  The decor is nice and the background music is exactly that: background. The employees are friendly enough. It seemed as though our servers wasn't haven't a good day. Oh well.   We got the mussels as appetizers. Me personally, I'm a HUGE fan of seafood especially mussels. But these ones were kind of bland. They had a briny taste to them and the only thing that made up for it was the creamy sauce. I put hot sauce on the mussels just for flavour.  The sweet potato fries were okay. Pretty sure they make them the same way everywhere.  The Insomia burger was also okay. Nothing that can't be had else where.   I will say that my friends did enjoy the pasta dishes so most def give those a try. The tacos were okkkayyy."}
{"text":"This place might be a bood restaurant/bar.  I rarely drink so the things that might make this place shine is dead to me.  I was recommended to this place on account of them having coffee drinks and wifi, but I went at dinnertime and it's way too dark to get any work done.  And I'm the only person trying to do anything productive in here.   The burger I had was decent, but nothing interesting of different than any other burger of this range...though this one was more expensive.  The BBQ sauce and french fries were good.  Better than average, but the Greek salad was worse than average so that balances out.  The menu didn't impress overall and the prices seem high for what you get...that feature matches the pretentious atmosphere.  But clearly they are fooling lots of people because business seemed good and, after all, it was recommended by somebody at a restaurant that I DO like.    I wouldn't avoid this place, but I'll never go out of my way to come here either."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to grab brunch at Insomnia for our 1 year anniversary celebration and we absolutely loved it!   The first thing I noticed was the interior design of the restaurant. The fairy lights were a nice touch and the back couch seating area was a fun twist from a conventional seating arrangement. The overall ambience was lovely- casual and fun.  Service was friendly and our food came out quite quickly- good thing because we were starving!   Food was by far our highlight. We ordered the Charlotte eggs benedict and the Heaven on Earth french toast. The Charlotte tasted great- I especially enjoyed their home fries in their special sauce. It had amazing flavour- especially when dipped in their delicious hot sauce! I appreciated how they made their home fries unique to an otherwise rather boring side dish. The Heaven on Earth also did not disappoint! It was soft and the flavour of the cream cheese contrasted nicely against the sweet berries.   I really enjoyed my meal and will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and our server was very nice, checked on us consistently. Tried two dishes - the Mac and Cheese was delicious, very flavourful and the perfect mix of cheese. One of the best Mac and Cheese dishes I've ever had. The pork Schnitzel was an interesting dish - I wasn't a big fan of the way it was put together however it wasn't horrible. Domestic beers were also very well priced, overall great experience.  If you're in the area I would definitely recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Having lived in the area for a while, Insomnia has been a frequent stop for me for over a decade now.   It's one of those places that i keep rediscovering. When i first stumbled across it, i loved it. Forgot about it for a while. Remembered it. Went a lot, Forgot about it. Remember it again. Went back a few times. You get the picture. Brunch, dinner, drinks, hang out, it serves all purposes.   There are better places around if you need creative food, but what you get at insomnia is solid regular food, solid service and a solid atmosphere (great specials on alcohol too).  There's something about the place that makes it easy to forget about, especially since it's followed the same general formula it's entire time being around. However, when in doubt and are stumped for ideas, it's a great fall back that will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Apart from the dreadfully long wait, Insomnia is another great brunch spot. I don't usually order meaty meals but I decided to give the Memphis Benedict (pulled pork with poached eggs) a try and it was soo delicious! The pork was tender and juicy and they gave a generous amount. The home fries was outstanding as well. Baked and tossed in their special sauce (somewhat like a ketchup sauce), these potatoes were super crispy and made a usual brunch more unique."}
{"text":"Everyone raves about this place and I thought it was all hype- thank goodness I was proved wrong!  I'm not a cocktail person, but when it's made right, I get transformed!  Insomnia makes them right.  Try anything on the menu, I dare you not to be blown away.  We popped in for brunch, and I wasn't expecting much.  It looked more like a place that spent more money on decor than good food- but I shut up about that pretty quick- I couldn't stop stuffing my mouth with those homefries!  I got the bacon grilled cheese, someone else got the andouille, another couple got the pulled pork benny, and someone else got the huervos rancheros veggie.  Everything was en pointe and perfect, flavourful and varied!  The table was quiet for the longest time as we savoured every morsel.  I gotta stop writing- I still have leftover homefries."}
{"text":"One word, EGGS BENEDICT, okay maybe it's 2 words. There are a tone of brunch and lunch options at insomnia as the eggs Benedict are my fav the lunch menu is filled with fresh sandwiches and salads. You can never go wrong with a fresh mimosa in the morning!"}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant I tried in Toronto and it set a high bar for the quality of food in Toronto. I highly recommend the chicken waffles. I loved their rendition: from the display to the taste. The chicken was thick and tender, sandwiched between light fluffy waffles and covered in this unique sweet and sour syrup. We also ordered the Manami eggs benedict which had your choice of bacon or peameal (I was unfamiliar with this bc I'm from the States. It's similar to baked ham) on a curried rice patty instead of the traditional English muffin. Together it made for a salty, crunchy, and delicious dish.   Other notes: Service was very slow. We waited a long time to get our waters and give them our orders. Fortunately, the atmosphere made for a comfortable and casual time (so no rush!) The interior was decorated for Halloween, and they have couches and comfy seats in the back. Really great for groups!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Insomnia is one of those restaurants that will always be on the back of my mind. It seems to always lure me back mysteriously lol. Located right at Bloor/Bathurst, this gem is great for a GNO or a date night... I absolutely adore those dreamy Christmas light decors! And I love the fact that they open until 2am!  The restaurant has a nice vibe. It is a busy location, so be sure to make a reservation! Also prepare to yell across the table because this place can get pretty loud! Service is excellent. Servers are fun, energetic, and always make sure everyone is having a great time! Unfortunately, can't say the same for food... always a hit and miss for me.  With the $10 off discount from Yelp, it led me to Insomnia one hungry night. My friends and I were seated at the back lounging area with the comfy couches. Chicken linguine with pesto was delicious. The Little Italy pizza had some really strong cheeses... a bit too much for me to handle! Nontheless, still a satisfying meal :)  Came back for GNO on Martini Madness Thursdays. Drinks were great... got a good list to choose from! Service was amazing... we even got a round of free shots, yeah :D!! Food, on the other hand, weren't up to par. But the ice wine sorbet saved the day! I swear, this needs to stay on the menu lol. It was to die for!  3rd time is always a charm. The $25 prix fixe was a great deal :) Food was much better! I started off with the Creamy Hummus Dip, and then Chicken and Waffle Tower as my main... both fantastic! But dessert was a bit disappointing. Carrot cake seemed store bought and half-melted ice cream with lots of whipped cream wasn't too attractive either.  Yes, so 3.5 stars with all the hit and misses. And yes, I still mysteriously come back from time to time lol. Something about this place excites me, jk LMAO. Until next time!"}
{"text":"What a lovely place! Service is truly amazing, and so is their food! Loved their Eggs benedict!"}
{"text":"I had the worst brunch experience here. It took them more than half an hour to get me a cup of tea. Meanwhile, the table next to us who got their table at the same time as us already got their food and were almost done eating. And the most disappointing thing is that we haven't even got to order our food. This is totally unacceptable. I will never ever go to this place again and will not recommend it to anyone. P.S. I really would like to rate this place a ZERO star if it's allowed"}
{"text":"Really crowded for brunch on weekends but once you are seated and served food you will definitely know the reason. Big menu, cheap caesars, delicious food. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"had brunch with a friend here. service and ambiance was good. i ordered the huevos rancheros. i felt that the flavors were pretty tame. it was okay, but didn't really stand out for me."}
{"text":"I rarely give a 5 star for a place I've only been to once --but this place was awesome in all accounts.   The only annoying-ish thing about the whole experience was their limited reservation slots with a 48hour cancellation free.   Food- delicious. Came for brunch. Everyone was very happy with their meals. We split the PLT and the huevos rancheros with a side of sausage. Both were awesome and I'd get again. Huge portions. Came with a side of home fries and side salad.   Drinks--$5 mimosas. And they did not skimp on the champagne!  Even the coffee was good with hint of cinnamon.    Service--excellent! Scott was our waiter and he is awesome. Attentive and did great with a large group of 8!   Cost- very reasonably priced with huge portions.   Overall - excellent and would be back!!"}
{"text":"Great brunch. The restaurant is very nice and the food is good. We ordered the Charlotte Benedicts and the Omelette. Everything was very tasty. I would come back to try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Good service, not so good food. My huevos rancheros was really just a side of a plate of potatoes swimming in some tangy red sauce that tasted like concentrated ketchup and oil. Barf."}
{"text":"I went for Sunday brunch with a friend. We got there around 11:30 and there was a lineup out the door.   I am not a fan of the patrons that were in line with us. They were unhelpful and rude.  A pair of 20 something boys misinformed me about having to wait in line just to put my name down on the list. A pod of 20 something girls were complaining about the wait and occupying the entire front entrance making it hard to hear if my name was called while waiting behind a closed door.   We actually only waited about 10 minutes after I was finally convinced by my friend that I didn't have to wait to put my name on the list. The seating was very comfortable with a good amount of distance between the adjacent tables.   I ordered the Huevos Rancheros. It was my first time having this dish but I though it was decent. The high point of the dish is the weird looking homefries. Overall a well presented dish.  ($10). As a non meat consumer, I didn't think the menu offered too much variety.  I would go again though this place is nothing spectacular.   side: I was distracted by all the pretty bottles hanging on the liquor wall."}
{"text":"My friend's and I were visiting from out of town. I researched  brunch places in Toronto and came across this resturant. The restaurant is small and busy. It was 6 of us so our projected wait time was an hour or more. However, we understood because we arrived at a peak brunch time. Anywho, each of us got mimosas from the bar. Collins (bartender) was great and recommended the pineapple mimosa. This was a perfect choice. It was made just right. Collins also had an Awesome personality. For my food, I ordered the steak and eggs(substituted for fruit). This meal was delicious. The steak was made medium as I ordered and very flavorful. It also came with potatoes which they called them fries which were good as well. I highly recommend this place if you're visiting Toronto. Great service, food and drinks!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I cannot get enough of this place - we always order the same dish because it never fails to be incredibly delicious (chicken and waffles, chicken thigh sandwich). The service is usually great, however it can get really busy so be wary of the rush hour times (we've showed up and there were 45 minute wait times). My only suggestion would be to have a better dessert selection, but that's due to my sweet tooth. As always, we will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great spot on Bloor just east of Bathurst. Went last Saturday night with another couple. Service was excellent, food was superb and portion sizes were very good. Ambiance was amazing. 5 stars for me. Ensure you call to make reservations."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday around 1:30pm, no wait, got seated right away. The hostess seem pretty efficient but a bit unfriendly. She did not smile to greet us and when your table is ready, she simply pointed her fingers at patrons and said \"You! Come with me, You, stay here...\"  This is not a bootcamp, lighten up and how about a smile?   The food was good, their potatoes with their special sauce was da bomb. I ordered the traditional egg Benny with beacon. My eggs were a bit over cooked but the super crunchy English muffin made up for it. I love egg Benny but dislike wet soggy English muffins that comes with it. Every dish is served with a side of garden salad which I loved. The coffee was really good with a hint of cinnamon. You get free refills with food purchase.  Bonus!  Good service, good food at a great price. I would definitely come back here again"}
{"text":"I have been hearing a lot about Insomnia Cafe on Bloor and Bathurst. Being a brunch fanatic it only seemed right to visit this establishment. Prior to making this decision however I decided to peruse their menu online. I considered it a big plus that Insomnia has a website with a menu that also includes prices. After studying their menu I felt there were sufficient options to make the trip over. Sadly I forgot my camera, but decided to use my iPhone instead. Not the best pictures, but you hopefully will get the gist of our order.  I arrived 10 minutes before my friend did, so I ordered a coffee to start. I made sure to confirm with the waitress that they had unlimited coffee refills. To my relief, they did. Lack of unlimited refills would have warranted my exit. I know it seems extreme, but after visiting many brunch restaurants, this type of service is expected.  My friend arrived and ordered an orange juice for $3.00, while I inquired as to whether the coffee had cinnamon in it. I could not tell if the cinnamon was coming from the coffee or the sugar. As it turns out their coffee has a hint of cinnamon. I actually liked the taste, but some may find an issue with this added ingredient.  I generally like to order a sweet and savory option. Unfortunately there were no sweet side options. If I wanted to get something sweet I would have to order off the regular menu. I was not happy about this since the prices for each menu option already ranged from $7 plus. My friend noticed a child's section to the menu and pointed out how there was a sweet option called \"Mini French Toast\" that should satisfy my sweet craving for $4.50. However, since I am not 12 or under, I needed to talk my way into it. It actually did not take any arguing on my part to get the \"Mini French Toast.\" So our order consisted of \"Heaven on Earth\" for my friend and the \"Eggs Benedict\" and the children's French toast.  My friend was enamored with her French toast. It consisted of berries, cream cheese and syrup. My  Benny was pretty good. It had a good portion of potatoes lathered in a sauce that bordered on heavy ketchup (my friend was not a huge fan and she compared it to Ketchup Chips), a light salad of arugula, and a hollandaise sauce that was satisfying and not too rich with a hint of citrus. My French toast unfortunately was a letdown.  The bread was too dry, that not even a strong dose of syrup was able to nourish. I suspect a longer soaking time in milk and eggs would have rectified this problem.  Generally my friend and I like to take our time during brunch and catch up on the happenings of our week.  However, this restaurant seemed to be very popular that we were distracted by the line that circled onto the sidewalk. Maybe it was not the staff's intention, but we felt rushed. So we promptly paid the bill and headed to the Cafe next door.  All things considered, we were satisfied with our meal. Some hits and misses on my end, but considering that I was already pretty full by the time I got to the dry french toast, it's lacking texture did not really affect my overall satisfaction of Insomnia Cafe. However, if you are looking to relax and have a leisurely meal in a cozy and private environment; this is not the place for that. For leisure I recommend the Green Beanery next door. It's lofty interior, ample seating, and space between tables and chairs makes this coffee shop/store a great environment for relaxing, enjoying a great cup of coffee and for stimulating conversation. Do not be deceived by its exterior. We also thought it was only a store, only to be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Such great food!! We got in early (around 10am) and had to wait until 11am to order mimosas. I ordered the Salmon Benedict with the rice cakes instead of English muffins and it was so filling!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times for brunch and dinner, had dinner delivered a bunch of times as well.  Food is consistently good and reliable.  Checking in here offers $10 off $50 food order.  My favourite dish here is the Mussels, cooked in white wine, pesto, cream, garlic, onion, and baby spinach.  The portion is big, the sauce is creamy and delicious, excellent for dipping the bread that comes with the dish when dining in.  They also have an extensive drink list, I enjoy their Chocolate Martini and Lychee Martini (with lychees).  If you love martinis (like I do), they offer $5 ($6 for premium) martinis every Thursday.  If you like domestic draft and rail liquor, they have $4 special after 10pm every night.  Servers are super nice here, one time gave us some Insomnia Shots because we were \"great customers\" (input on the bill with a hand drawn heart, aww~)  This place is ALWAYS packed because they are awesome and popular, reservation is strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Came here for a catch-up brunch with friends and it definitely met expectations. I got the Charlotte Benedict with the smoked salmon. As someone who's fav foods is Benny's, Im going to get pretty critical. The salmon portions were generous though on the saltier side. The egg yolk was perfect for soft to medium poached. However, the hollandaise was not flavourful enough and there definitely wasn't enough of it. The English muffin was also nondescript, compared to fluffier ones I had in other places. The potatoes I really enjoyed, they were covered in some ketchup and BBQ sauce mixture but still remained crunchy for the most part. The salad was also good. Service wasn't as good as many other brunch places I've been to but we got seats almost right away. Would come back if in the area"}
{"text":"Insomnia has recently become a weekly hangout spot for some of my friends, namely Thursdays for their cheep martinis.   I've gone the last few weeks in a row and my experience has been pretty much the same each time.  Martinis: Purple Haze- tastes pretty much a \"porn star\", very sweet and kinda syrupy but thats to be expected, I honestly think my favourite part is the apple slice that comes floating in it  Diva- Probably my favourite I've had, i love the bitterness of grapefruit and its not to sweet so you can have a few   Snowball- This literally tastes like chocolate milk, and are soooo easy to drink  Venue- We've usually been able to get a table without waiting, and the time we did it was only about 5-10 min which we just sat at the bar. The service is fairly slow, especially the night they only had one server so we ended up waiting a while to get our orders taken and then recive the drinks, one of mine took over 15 minutes, BUT i was surprised to see it wasn't on my bill at the end of the night, without me even saying anything so kudos to that.  Overall it's a nice little bar to hangout at on a Thursday night"}
{"text":"Hands down the best brunch in Toronto. Simply can't beat it, and I've been just about everywhere. Awesome staff, especially the always hilarious Richard. They also happen to make one of the best bloody caesars in town (try it with ginger vodka and horseradish). Just make sure you show up with your whole party, or step aside, cowboy!"}
{"text":"Great for weekday lunch or brunch for a group!  A friend from Calgary arrived in town and a group of us wanted to get together while she was here and meet for brunch on a Monday.    So many places friends suggested were closed during the day on weekdays.    Then I thought of Insomnia and I am so glad I did!  Everyone enjoyed the food and as a table of 10 laughing loudly women (and one token guy) we must not have been the easiest to deal with but Matt, our awesome server took it all in stride with a smile.  Since we asked for separate bills tip was added automatically which I consider to be more than fair.  A credit card was required to secure the reservation with a $50 charge if we were a no show or cancelled with less than 24 hours notice, which I also thought was fair.  Best part was all the praise I received for setting up brunch at such a great place!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner the other night and loved it! Cocktails were fantastic and food was delicious. Definitely make a reservation if you are heading here during peak times . Looking forward to going back to explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"The cinnamon short stake was okay but the pulled pork (Memphis) was pretty good! If you show your student id, you can get 20% off :) (there's also no tap on the card machine when paying)"}
{"text":"Deliciously varied dishes. A great mix of old school comfort food with a fusion of modern cuisine. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for Sunday brunch online for 9:45. There were only 3 tables seated at that point. We asked to sit in the back because the front space was crowded with tables and noisy, but the server told us that since there were only 3 of us we had to sit in the front--you have to have 4 to sit in the back. I could see that being the case if it were super busy, but with so many open tables, and the way she talked to us, it was just off-putting.  That being said, the food and the service were excellent! My son enjoyed his steak and eggs, my husband had sausage and the French toast, and I had the eggs Benedict with tomatoes, spinach and avocado. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the potatoes with the gooey ketchup sauce--get it on the side or not at all. They are fairly accommodating for customizing your dish, which is really nice. By the time we were done at 11:30, there was a 45 minute wait, so come early!"}
{"text":"Fav brunch & fav late night. Average prices but amazing food, drinks, and service. And cute decor."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. This place is amazing!!!   Be warned--if you come for brunch, the line is probably going to be pretty long.   Service was very friendly but a little slow at times, but not a big deal.   We got the huevos rancheros and Lorraine eggs Benedict.   The huevos rancheros does not include meat so it's a great vegetarian option. It comes with a small salad and home fries. The home fries are so good! They give you a lot too but I still wish I had more.   The Lorraine includes choice of peameal or regular bacon. It also includes the homefries and salad.   Mimosas were $5, pineapple was the best. Other choices include cranberry, orange, and grapefruit. I also got a smoothie but it wasn't anything exciting.   Overall quality of the food is excellent and I would definitely recommend coming here if you get the chance!"}
{"text":"We came here after sushi on bloor took an hour wait and snakes and lattes didn't have any seats and were we lucky to find a place like this. The service was excellent, the ambiance was great and the overall environment of the place was great.   First thing's first is that this is NOT the best dinner place at all. We came here for dinner, and we ordered the 8 ounce burger, the eggplant pizza, and bruschetta. The burger I had was nice and juicy and came with a salad and fries ( which weren't crispy! grrr) but had a nice sort of homemade garlicy mayo. The bruschetta was quite nice albeit a bit standard and the pizza had a soft crust but tons of eggplant and really cheesy. Again, standard if not a bit below average bar food.  However, the best part of this place is how it looks and feels. The server we had was really nice and very helpful helping us decide which martinis to get and which shots to take, and I must say there is a HUGE selection of drinks. The instant you walk into this place you will notice the gigantic wall of alcohol they have. They even have Jager on tap (how awesome is that?). The martinis are quite pricey at $8.5 but there is such a wide selection of them it is insane. The lighting of the place is a bit dark but it is quite fitting for a bar sort of lounge.  This place is a very good example of a lounge-bar sort of restaurant. It isn't a very good place to eat but the food is very cheap (under $10) which explains the average food quality. However, it is not about the food it is about the drinks and the environment which this place absolutely nails. Definitely check this place out with friends if you are looking for a place to hang back, drink and relax. Think of it like a lounge/cafe with bar food and tons of alcohol without the bar-like atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for Brunch. Had the Lorraine Eggs Benedict (peameal) with waffles instead of English muffin. Great atmosphere, food, and service!"}
{"text":"Popped in here for an after dinner cocktail tonight. This place is still jumping after all these years! Almost every table was full of loud twenty somethings sipping colourful martinis and swilling pints. Though I am clearly much older than the majority of Insomnia's Friday night demographic if this night is indicative, it was still fun to be there and I enjoyed the decor and even the noisy atmosphere."}
{"text":"There is always a line, and I could not help myself but trying out to quench my curiosity. I had huevos rancheos. It was delicious enough, but nothing like it left a mark on my mind.   Servers were so busy, and it was difficult to grab their attention. Water was never refilled, and I had to wait 20 min to get my coffee refilled, and another 20 min to get my bill, and another 10 min to actually tap my card.  I wish I can give 3 and half."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for our one year wedding anniversary on Valentine's Day. We got the crab cakes and calamari as appetizers which were really good, calamari definetly is NOT frozen, the light crisp batter on them with the dip completed the whole dish. My wife had the shrimp linguine, which she said was delicious!(she's a big pasta lover) so coming from her that means alot. I had the chicken and waffles, which again a mouthgasm!  the chicken was cooked perfectly(tender & juicy) with a lightly coated deep-fried skin, on top of a Belgian waffle which was crispy, light & fluffy, what made it all come together as one piece of food art was the maple butter which has a amazing taste that I can not even describe! I even jokingly asked the server to sneak me some from the kitchen to take home, which she was all for! The drinks were good and strong/great selection, prices were a bit high so I didn't get more then one, wife had the diva martini and I had the Moscow mule. Service was good only complaint was when my wife got served her entree they didn't offer her grated Parmesan or pepper. All in all definitely excellent place to eat and mingle, and this restaurant actually saved me from getting s@#t from my wife as I didn't have time to give her a wedding gift or card,the amazing food made up for it!"}
{"text":"Nice interior, abstract art on the walls, cool lighting on the ceiling, fries were good.   Menus are clipboards which is kinda weird but the novelty is cool I guess.  Good place for a date."}
{"text":"4.5 stars ... it's very good! One of the best brunches in Toronto   This place is often found on many Toronto best brunch list and after going, I can see why!  Insomnia has earned its spot on the list in all ways... great atmosphere, friendly and FAST service, wonderful food, and not too hefty on the wallet.  Is it my number one spot? It a close call between here and Le Baratin.  Either way, you cannot go wrong with either spot.  This place is incredibly popular ... there were many people waiting for a table throughout the time we ate here... we're talking at least 12+ always standing outside.  They have limited reservations before 10 am online but after that, it feels like a bit of a free for all.  Either come early or be lucky to grab an online rez.  When we arrived @ 10 am, we were warmly greeted and sat within minutes of arriving.  We had a great day so the windows and doors were open and allowed the warm breeze to filter through the place.  It's such a cute spot with a lot of open space, exposed brick and nice touches like the branches above your head.  Considering how many tables they turn over, I was surprised on how spotless everything was.  Our table was beside the window and we had a lot of room ... perfect for shots!    The menu is big and a lot of it sounds sooo good.  We ended up getting the famous Heaven on Earth French Toast and a gluten free Manami Benedict with a side of their equally famous home fries.  Heaven on Earth French Toast - This is a generous (it can feed 2 people ... or one hungry big guy) portion of really well made french toast.  Nothing is more sad than a dry or soggy french toast.  At Insomnia, the custard fills every nook and cranny and it's crisped up so nicely so you have that great texture of crunchy and smooth custard in one bite.  It also have a good inch (yes a full inch!!) of berries and cream cheese filling!  This is one glorious indulgence and it comes with real maple syrup too!  Is it the best French Toast I've had... mmm no, Le Baratin takes it just cause Baratin French Toast stands on its own without any syrup or add ons.  Insomnia french toast by itself was well cooked but it was mostly flavourless as it relies on the berries and maple syrup. Maybe just adding a touch of vanilla or cinnamon would elevate it.  Manami Benedict - Perfectly poached eggs with oozing yolks over curried rice patties is such an interesting idea that I had to have it.  It was very good but I have to admit that the fries possibly stole the show.  Medium sized chunks of super crispy potatoes then covered in a tangy tomato based sauce ... oh its good!  It also came with a side salad and that was a nice little bite to feel like you're eating kinda healthy.  Overall, service was fast, pleasant, and kept our coffee filled to the brim.  Loved this spot for brunch and would definitely come back for the fries.  I would like to come back for dinner.  Definitely a great spot for brunch!"}
{"text":"We came here for Summerlicous but apparently they don't do it for brunch service.  We were a little disappointed, but was still impressed by the food! I had the Charlotte eggs benny, which had an amazing yolk. You can also substitute it for a waffle. The coffee is flavoured with cinnamon, which gives it a nice charred kick - had to ask for my free refill. The accompanying potatoes was lathered in what seems to be their homemade BBQ sauce; strong on the ketchup and vinegar. I think I would've preferred just regular potatoes but this was an interesting change.   Service was friendly and attentive. I would definitely go again for brunch. May be wise to make reservations as it fills up very quickly."}
{"text":"Insomnia never disappoints me - I've ordered chicken and waffles, Mac and cheese, some brunch items, a plethora of drinks; everything was solid. It's mostly comfort food but the atmosphere, with the exposed brick and the fairy lights,  is very romantic and dreamy in the evening.  This is a great spot if you need a quick date idea and you want a place that is good and palatable for most tastes - with a bit of a romantic/sexy aesthetic. It isn't iconic or mind blowing or super unique - but it's consistently great, and that is worth something! It's also opened very late!"}
{"text":"3 stars from brunch and as a bar/drink venue, 2 stars otherwise.  The lunch/dinner food is blah and overpriced considering mediocrity of food. The pizzas are absolute cardboard, ugh.  In an area that caters to students, it is one of the only nicer places in the Annex area to get a cocktail or mixed drink. They have DJs on Friday and Saturday nights and the place is dimly lit with a relaxing atmosphere.  The brunch food is a bit better and more reasonably priced, so I've been here a few times for brunch over the years."}
{"text":"This place is our Toronto obsession. We went there twice in our 24 hour stay! First we went for dinner and drinks. We ordered the wings (both flavors)-loved the honey garlic! My husband loves the chicken and waffles, sister loved her chicken linguini and we ordered the fries with horseradish aioli-so good!   We then decided to go again for brunch. Heaven. Burnt marshmallow ice cream? Yes please!! Delicious. They were able to seat is fairly quickly and told us upfront they had an issue in the kitchen so we would have to wait a little longer for food (we liked the advance notice on this). The coffee? It's has this delicious cinnamony taste. I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 11am on a Saturday for brunch. As this is their busiest time, we put our names down for 2 and waited. Insomnia offers a service that ALL restaurants should have - they will text you when your table is ready, so you can leave, shop around, grab a coffee, etc, and come back. A+ for this!! Understandably, we waited about 45 mins for a table.   What bummed me out was after waiting that long, it was another 10 minutes before Scott, our server, greeted us. Let it be known that this is in no way bad mouthing Scott. He was doing what he could during their busiest period and trying to keep everyone happy. He also managed to check in and ask us how things were, so no complaints there. Maybe the sections are a tad too large for a Saturday brunch service, since we also didn't get a coffee refill until after finishing our meal.   Now food. I ordered the Memphis eggs Benedict - sweet and savoury pulled pork with perfectly runny poached eggs and a creamy, well balanced hollandaise. Not to mention their home fries, which I would wait 45 minutes for alone. Insomnia, your brunch is among the best in the city!"}
{"text":"Came here for my fiance's birthday dinner.  We ordered Chicken&Waffles and Chicken Linguine.  Chicken & Waffles was good (can't really go wrong with this dish!), but what surprised me was the Chicken Linguine. It was by far the most flavourful pasta I've had. Great sauce to pasta ratio, and you get a pretty good portion as well. I will go back just for this dish."}
{"text":"Soooo delicious! The environment was so cool and laid back and decorated so beautifully. We sat at the bar for brunch because we didn't make reservations and it was a 30-45 min wait for a table. But we did get full service at the bar by a friendly bar tender and a very nice server. I started with the $5 mimosa and Daniel got a Caesar, which was good but definitely not our taste. I got the short stack of almond meal and buckwheat pancakes which comes with a pb and banana sauce. They were so filling, I could only eat half of my plate and Daniel got waffles with vanilla ice cream, toast and a side of bacon. He was very happy with his entire meal and finished it all. We will definitely be coming back to insomnia next time we are in Toronto but this time we will make reservations!"}
{"text":"Steps away from the Bathurst stop. Great food, great service, good atmosphere, long wait. Luckily we got seats at the bar and didn't wait too long. Coffee has a touch of cinnamon. Nice touch. Potatoes are fantastic. Peameal. Had no idea what that meant. Good pieces of ham. It's ham, right. Gotta look it up."}
{"text":"Insomnia has been in the Annex for what seems like forever, that's a good sign. Our group was seated in the lounge section, with its overstuffed couches and chairs. The paintings of the wall were interesting, it seemed like the put the strangest ones in the back of the restaurant, the burning forest was perhaps a bit much, but a good conversation piece, indeed. The server was amiable and let us know the drink specials as soon as we sat down. The drink specials were good, $4 creemore pints and 3$ jager shots on Monday night. The food was nothing special, the fries were crispy and excellent, served with an aioli. The chicken sandwich lacked much chicken and my dining partners chicken and brie sandwich was over-brie'd (if that's possible!). The lively atmosphere was perfect for having a few drinks and an appetizer, but I wouldn't eat an entire meal here again."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Had an amazing brunch with my bestie there last Saturday. There was quite a queue when we first got there. But we didn't have to stand there, doing nothing but waiting. Instead, we were asked to give my phone number to be put on a waiting list. It only took less than half an hour for us to get the message from them. Didn't even finish our Starbucks. Lol. Would definitely come again. :)"}
{"text":"It was my first time at this restaurant and I went for brunch and it was really good. The service was really good and the food was delicious. The waffles were really good and so were the home fries. Can't wait to come back and try something new from the brunch menu or possibly the other menu. I will be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this restaurant that hasn't already been said?  The Heaven on Earth french toast is delicious, definitely enough to share between two people, and a must-try.  The home fries truly are legendary.  You will likely order an additional side.  The Isabelle eggs benny was great.  For those that love avocado toast and eggs benny, this is a perfect marriage.  Best of both really.  I will be back!  Oh, the pineapple juice mimosa.... You can't have just one!  They're very good.  It's a great spot to catch up with friends, casual, no fuss.  Good food, great service, and no pressure.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"I've been to Insomnia a few times for brunch during the summer. On Sundays, they have $5 mimosas with your choice of fruit juice, which is awesome. The ambience is good, and the atmosphere is fun, but the cleanliness of the tables could be improved. Be prepared to wait for a table on a sunday for brunch.   In terms of food, the eggs benedict and the huevos rancheros are quite good. The home fries in the legendary sauce are decent, but I don't find the sauce blows my mind in the flavour department. I still have to add ketchup! My husband once had the pear grilled cheese for brunch, which I wouldn't recommend. It's served on grilled challah, which was so incredibly dry and crunchy, it was falling apart. The bread was very thick relative to the amount of filling. Not the best."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night. We did make reservations, saw a few people waiting for seats outside the restaurant. But it didn't seem extremely busy. Food was delicious!  Chicken and waffles were amazing!  I definitely would recommend anyone going to try it and their Mac n cheese! Service was great. I ordered a drink that I didn't like and the server took it back without charging me. Needless to say, I will be coming back"}
{"text":"Stopped in Toronto for a quick layover and ended up at this gem due to the mere fact that the kitchen was still open after 11PM and boy was it a treat. The operations manager Mitchell took care of us and the service and food was top notch! I had the chicken and waffles and Mac and cheese and every bite was to die for!"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere overall is great. It did seem more intimate / more suitable for one on one dining and drinks, I did not see many groups of friends at a table.   My first experience with Insomnia was through food delivery. I wanted to come in and experience the full package so my boyfriend and I had reservations for a Saturday night. We were greeted and seated immediately, right by the windows facing Bloor st. The restaurant was dim and romantic, but the street lights coming in added a nice touch to the ambience. Our server, Raza (not sure how to spell her name, sorry!!), was very friendly and informative. We ordered everything she recommended and we loved every dish. She also mentioned how their Old Fashioned is more traditional, and how they have a regular who comes in exclusively for the old fashioneds. I've had my fair share of Old Fashioneds and this is one of my favourites (they use 1 big square cube of ice rather than regular ice cubes!).  To start we ordered the mussels, and Raza recommended we get their complimentary bread to dip. The bread isnt listed on the menu with the dish as the mussels are noted gluten free, but it is a very highly recommended option! The mussels were soo good, and didn't have any grimey seafood scents or flavour. The sauce the mussels were soaked in was creamy, but not overly rich. We also tried the calamari, and it was good, but the mussels were my favourite out of the two.  For our entree, my boyfriend was debating between chicken and waffles or their spicy penne. Our server mentioned the owner of Insomnia is also the co-owner of Dirty Bird, so the chicken and waffles are the same recipe. He immediately chose the chicken and waffles. I heard Insomnia is known for their signature Insomnia burgers, but I was in the mood for pasta. Raza said the rose sauce shrimp linguine was her favourite, so I went with that. I highly recommend the shrimp linguine with rose sauce, especially if you're hungry. The portion was huge, and I really wanted to keep eating it but I couldn't finish.   I got a second drink after my old fashioned, called Smoking Gun. It wasnt too sweet, nor tasted overwhelmingly of bourbon. It was a luxurious orange chocolate cocktail with an even better aftertaste, and I love how they fill the beverage up to its rims!  I would say Insomnia is the perfect date night spot, or a great place to enjoy a cocktail or two (they also have a long list of intricate cocktails + the usual beer and wine) catching up with your friends."}
{"text":"Waited for an hour to get a table. Good thing my friend and I haven't seen each other for ages. so we had so much to talk about and just didn't care about waiting. Servers were busy but didn't mind stopping by for a chat or to answer query about the menu. Thought of ordering the sandwich, but decided on ordering the eggs Benedict, had the one with bacon, it was okay. the potato salad (fries?) was tasty and the greens were refreshing. The serving is huge and the price is superb! Will be back to try the others. The"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good old comfort food on a Sunday morning,  I think insomnia is where you need to go!  My goodness was this place amazing! My boyfriend got the pulled pork benny with home style Fries and I had the heaven on earth.  Now let's talk about my Bf's meal first,  I'm a huge fan of fries and the ones that came with the benny were smothered in this sweet red sauce that absolutely melts in your mouth.  It was fantastic. And as for the pulled pork,  oh they did not go cheap on the portion of meat! Aside from that it was soft, saucey,  and definitely a good one to get!  As for the heaven on hearth, it was a rich and creamy Berry mixed cream cheese filling between 2 slices of French toast. I have a huge sweet tooth and it was just so perfect for me!  After you drizzle a bit of their syrup onto the French toast and you get a full bite of all the layers,  it's as if you just entered a whole new level of comfort food brunch experience. The worst or maybe best part is,  it doesn't feel dense at all!  I finished the whole thing without getting that stomach upset a McDonald Mcflurry would give me.  It's quite disturbing and I don't even want to know how many calories was in that thing,  but it's quite worth it!!!"}
{"text":"I came here a second time to try their famous brunch menu. I truly enjoyed the \"Heaven on Earth\". At first I thought cheese and French toast don't match, but after trying this masterpiece I understood why such a combination exists. The French toast is quite thick and there's a rich amount of strawberries and cream cheese inside this giant sandwich. I honestly prefer this over pancakes. It's very fluffy and the maple syrup adds that extra \"oomph\" to it. My friend enjoyed the Charlotte Benedict. The service was once again excellent."}
{"text":"One of my favourite brunch places in downtown Toronto.   Unfortunately, lineups are the worst here, and they don't take reservations. So if you want to try it out, get their early and expect to wait (go next door to the Green Beanery while you wait and get some hipster coffee)"}
{"text":"Great brunch place -- pretty busy even at 1015am (and I think it opens at 10!) and no reservations, so make sure to come early if you are trying to grab a seat.   I generally find brunch to be tough to super mess up, but also hard to kill.. but Insomnia really did a great job with their eggs Benedict and service!!! The eggs Benedict came with these deliciously amazing home fries that were smothered in some sweet BBQ sauce so good I couldn't help but finish all of them. Also, the eggs Benedict hollandaise sauce was flavorful and creamy and I literally was scraping my plate with my potatoes so I could get all of it. I got my eggs benny with peameal bacon which is apparently some sort of fad in Toronto right now.. it was basically ham with some sort of crispy batter flakes. Glad I tried it but I would probably opt for smoked salmon or classic Canadian bacon in the future.   Also lots of options for sides, additions, etc.   Service was also fantastic -- our guy was so nice and friendly and made sure our waters and coffees were constantly filled.   Really pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, ordered the pancakes, took too long and was more of a 2 person serving. Was good, but would suggest that you share the pancakes. Came at 11:00 Am on a Sunday and we didn't have to wait."}
{"text":"Solid brunch spot. We tried stuffed French toast and eggs Benny both of which were spot on and delicious. We just sat at the bar but service was beyond expected at a busy restaurant like this. Will definitely come back to try other food."}
{"text":"Eggs undercooked, home fries slathered in a super sweet sauce I disliked, server was too focused on what I would assume is her boyfriend and did not attend to us despite us waving for 2 minutes. Overpriced brunch for what it is, better spots in the city that are cheaper. Mimosa was weak. Will not be returning"}
{"text":"Queued here for Sunday brunch but the wait was more than worth it. $5 mimosas are the first win followed by the the home fries which the entire table agreed were amazing.  One of the best brunches I've had hands down. Also the hostesses are super friendly which helps with long waits. Shoutout to our waitress Valentina who was just lovely & brought us monitor shots! See you again soon!"}
{"text":"The avocado and tomato benny is really delicious! The interior looks really nice as well. The potatoes weren't as good this time though, not crispy this time like before."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 6 girlfriends for a friend's birthday brunch on a Sunday morning. Note that they don't seat groups until everyone has arrived, so tell all your perpetually late friends that you're meeting 15 minutes earlier than you actually are ;)   We ordered a round of mimosas for the table and to eat I ordered the Huevos Rancheros, eggs over-hard. I cleaned my plate. I'm normally not a big potato person, but those saucy homefries are delish! Portions are generous and prices are so reasonable, around $10 give or take a few dollars for everything on the brunch menu. Everyone else around the table seemed to enjoy their meals, and there were rave reviews about the pancakes. (FYI, the pancakes are oven-baked and take 30 minutes, but from what I hear they are so worth the wait.)  Service was super friendly and attentive. I love that they have decanters of chilled water with slices of lemon on the table. I love that we all got a free round of birthday shots for the table at the end of our meal (I don't know what the shots were, but they were so good. I could have downed 10 of them in a row.) I love the obvious thought and care they put into everyone's dining experience here.   I had so much fun at Insomnia. At one point I actually stopped to say, \"I am having so much fun!\" I would definitely come back here for brunch. You should go, too!"}
{"text":"i came here for a late night dinner with my boyfriend, the food was average and the atmosphere was lovely.  However, the waitress really made the experience quite unpleasant. I completely understand a late night shift being difficult, and I usually don't mind a lackluster waitress. However, this waitress was noticeably rude and unpleasant.    I dont believe that this is a consistent happening at insomnia, but it definitely has been a turn off from visiting more frequently."}
{"text":"Cozy little spot on Bloor. Fav late night place to visit, especially for their chicken & waffles and late night menu :)"}
{"text":"Really liked it here, cos the aesthetic of the room was beautiful and sleek.  The food was also good, and the portions were fair at a good price.  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Decent place, but it didn't blow me out of the water.  Good brunch choices.   I recommend ordering from the brunch menu as its what they do best."}
{"text":"Great place to go to for a date! The decor was amazing and the overall atmosphere was very nice! I tried their Chicken Waffles and I was not dissapointed! The chicken itself was ok but the waffled were amazing! I also tried their grilled chicken taco! For a starter it only feeds one but it was overall a nice flavor! The guacamole inside the taco was the ingredient that captured me the most! The only thing about this place is the seating, felt a little too crowded sitting down! I wouldnt suggest bringing a big party to this place, but one on one dates is ideal. Overall great place!"}
{"text":"I've been sitting here for 45 minutes and I still don't have my food yet. Ordered the freshly squeezed orange juice, but it's totally Tropicana. Can't review the food yet since I haven't received my food. Atmosphere is nice and cozy. There are couches in the back. I guess this place would be better for a drink than brunch since the kitchen clearly can't keep up with the orders. Server assured us once that our food is coming....but it hasn't. We didn't make any substitutions to our order which would cause a delay. Perhaps they're still getting the chicken to hatch the eggs I ordered?"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Great brunch, great mains. I almost always get the burger which is delicious on a milk bun with garlic aioli.   I ordered the burger take out once and when I got home I found it was raw. Angry and hungry, I went back the next day to complain. The management offered me a $25 gift certificate and a *cooked* burger free of charge. Pretty awesome customer service. Never had any other problems."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!! I was in town for a friends wedding and we were looking for a good brunch spot in the neighborhood and boy were we impressed. The food, the drinks, the service, and the atmosphere were all excellent. A group of 4 of us went and we got our food quickly and the waitress made it very accommodating for me to add an order to go when we ordered the food. I got one of their specialty cocktails which was great and paired well with the General PLT. A unique take on one of my favorite sandwiches, the PLT had Peameal bacon, tomatoes, mesclun mix, and a fried egg. This sandwich was life changing and the only thing that could make it better were the sides it came with. A mixed green salad with light vinaigrette and the greatest hash browns with \"special sauce\" that I've ever had. I literally cannot stop thinking about those potatoes... I would hands down recommend this place to anyone visiting the Yorkville section of Toronto, and definitely make a reservation for brunch. The wait wasn't too long but I'm sure they are packed on certain days. A+ to everyone at Insomnia!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great vibe, great lighting, nice spot for a date. They make great lemon drops and moscow mules. The bartenders are on point.   The food is also really good. The quesadillas are amazing."}
{"text":"Came here for my cousins 28th birthday brunch. First off the atmosphere is gorgeoussssss, with twinkle lights and leaves form the ceiling. We ordered the 3 eggs omelette  with an avacado toast on the side. it was amazzzinggg. It comes with seasoned and sauced potatoes and salad. They also put a candle in the toast for us. Definitely would recommend for anyone visiting the area."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant with creative drinks and super friendly service! I've eaten here for both dinners and brunch and the food is always consistently delicious. Their drink menu is equally impressive, with the Toronto Sour a definite highlight. One of my fave spots in the annex"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  It was not the food that drawn me into Insomnia Cafe... it was their daily drink specials.  I was suppose to meet up with my yelp friend to have a quick bite before watching Yelp's Hot Doc Superhero. And since I was down at the Annex early and need a place to hang and Insomnia Cafe ended up to be an excellent choice.  Nice and Friendly service. Cheap Creemore Pint for $4 on Monday (different everyday of the week). Nice and classy decoration. I felt really comfortable having a pre dinner drink at the bar area waiting for my friend to show up.  From now on, I know where to park myself aside from the Green Beanery next door... And Insomnia Cafe even have Free WIFI access... hmmmm Am I going to make Insomnia my Yelp's office?? Drinking beer and uploading photos??"}
{"text":"Always impressive service, whether it's brunch or dinner. Great drinks, wonderful gluten free and dairy free options - I would take a picky eater there anyday! The atmosphere is super laid back and young feeling. The only complaint I'd have is that it's too loud, but that's because it's so popular. I always go with my boyfriend and we're never let down. Prices are quite reasonable too. The waitress actually noticed that I didn't eat chili peppers on the tacos so she made sure that the rest of my taco orders didn't have peppers on them either - without me saying a thing. Such positive experiences here!"}
{"text":"Two words people - tofu rancheros. HELLA GOOD! It's better than scrambled eggs! I would go as far as to say this is by far my most favorite brunch menu item I've ever ordered. Ever.  There was some tomato chutney thing going on with the corn tortilla, and the textures going on with the dish was a  win for me . The portion size was perfect too. Not too heavy, not too light. Just right.....and it hit the spot so good.  I unfortunately didn't get homefries with my dish, but I stole some from my friend who was there with me and boy were they just the best thing ever.   Good food, good service. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Looks kind of weird from the outside with that big eye sign but it's actually a really hip restaurant. Have only been there for brunch but both times I really enjoyed myself. Their coffee isn't like regular diner coffee. It has a hint of cinnamon in it which makes it delicious. Eggs Benedict are super yummy but the baked apple pancakes are pretty dense and could use more apples."}
{"text":"Ambience was really nice. It was my first time here and will probably be back soon. The eggs benedict were really good with the pulled pork. I just wish they have more options for their lunch or brunch. The server was hot though so I guess that adds up to the rating I put here."}
{"text":"Great portions and nice atmosphere. The Benny's are delicious and eggs cooked just right. It comes with a side salad and crispy potatoes that I would devour if I wasn't so full already."}
{"text":"Very good eggs benny!   I've lived in the area for about a year, and it has been impossible to be seated right away without reservations on the weekend. From word of mouth and Yelp I decided to finally make reservations for my girlfriend any myself. Unfortunately the front desk staff fudged the reservation and couldn't find it when we arrived. Luckily, a table of four cancelled and we were provided a seat.   I would say that our breakfast lived up to the hype, and the service we were provided was solid. I got the classic eggs benny and my girlfriend got the smoked salmon benny. These come with potatoes and a salad, and portions are quite large. The potatoes come covered in a barbecue-y sauce, which tastes amazing, but to be honest I'd prefer mine without it... if that makes sense. I just found it to be a little too much.  Anyway, if you love eggs benedict, this is definitely a place to jot down on your list of breakfast joints to try... just book in advance!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with my family and the food was delicious. The taste, presentation and service was absolutely amazing"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere. Friendly staff. Awesome food. The chicken & waffles are TO DIE FOR!! & the nachos are phenomenal too!!"}
{"text":"I was in the Annex last week with a friend and we decided to drop in for a quick dinner at Insomnia.  The atmosphere was really nice and our server was really good. Both my friend and I had been in there before for drinks.  We ordered a Greek Salad to share, she ordered grilled Calamari (without the spicy sauce) and I ordered the Red Vegetarian Curry.  All three items we ordered were an embarrassment to the culinary community in our city.  The Greek Salad (and we weren't expecting much) came without Cucumbers. Seriously?   We sent it back and it came with Cucumbers.  As far as Greek Salads go, it was mediocre at best. I am not quite sure why people make Greek Salads with Lettuce, especially Romaine ... and this wasn't detailed on the menu.  Instead of nice chunks of Feta, it was served with Feta Dressing.  That's just lazy.  My friend's Calamari was rubbery and tasteless ... while she asked that the spicy sauce not be put on, there was no effort to enhance the flavour of food.  The Calamari was sent back.  I have had Red Curry many times ... and it is usually made with Coconut Milk and a Spicy Red Curry, creating a nice, rich broth.  This was dry and grainy ... almost devoid of any real Curry flavour.  That's the bad news.  The good news is that we had an awesome server, who was friendly, kind and very accommodating - she got a great tip!  So, my message to Insomnia ... keep up the great work in hiring your front of house staff ... and overhaul your kitchen."}
{"text":"They have a good selection of drinks, and I enjoyed their s'more ice cream dessert. The ambience is great, and good services. It was very relaxing and chill."}
{"text":"Brunch! Period ! That is my all time favorite place to come. My boyfriend and I decided to check it out a few years ago and from then on we have always went to Insomnia. I've shared this place with my close friends expressing how much I love it and how AMAZING the coffee and breakfast is . I brought them for my birthday brunch and now .... they claim this to be their spot as well .... I figured ... lol   Its not just the food that is amazing but the place . Its one of those places with a great vibe and people so It just makes you feel great ! Brunch menu favorites would have to be Heaven on Earth and the simple eggs benedict ; with there home fries ! SO delicious ! I've had all good things to say about this place and hope it stays amazing !"}
{"text":"Very impressed.. Was walking down Bloor st in the Annex and a couple of hotties were handing out flyers to promote the bar!  Posting a pic of it.. they have specials everyday of the week.  ;)"}
{"text":"I came here at 11am for Sunday brunch. The place was already quite busy and we were told it would be around a 20 minute wait. The hostess took our number and said she'd text us when a table was ready. In around 20 minutes, we did receive said text. When we came back, we were immediately led to our table. After perusing our menus, my friend and I both decided to go with benny's. I had the classic benny with peameal bacon and cheddar - it was really good! Eggs poached to perfection, portion size was good and can I just say that the home fries were AMAZING! I have never before experienced such fantastic home fries. They were covered in a bit of a sauce so they weren't super dry and didn't even need ketchup. Highly recommend. The only thing that would have pushed this to 5 stars is for the service to be a bit more attentive. Will be back soon, though. When we left, the line went out the door, so make sure you go early!"}
{"text":"All I can say is Yummy! I came for the breakfast and it was delish! Such a warm cozy restaurant. The 45 minute wait was the only downside. But I'd highly recommend it if you looking for a great brunch."}
{"text":"I met a few friends here for Tuesday night dinner. Its one of those places that is always reliable and is conveniently located right outside Bathurst Station, so its great for post-work hangs.   I hadn't been to Insomnia in ages, and even longer since I'd been there for something besides brunch (hello the buffalo sauce home fries on the side of the bennies here are yum, btw). I forget how comprehensive (without being TOO big) their menu is, and how its pretty vegetarian friendly. There is at least one veg option in every section of the menu, and quite a few in the apps/sides menu.   I got the walnut penne with white wine cream sauce, spinach, asparagus, and sautéed onion. I have a soft spot for anything in a cream sauce and for nuts in pasta, so this was a no-brainer. It arrived as a massive bowl of comfort food looking goodness. I knew I wouldn't be able to finish it all in one sitting, especially since I had foolishly ordered a beer (\"More carbs on the side of your carbs miss?\" \"Sure!\"). But that's ok, I did my best, I finished more than half, it was delicious, and have the rest in my fridge awaiting me for later.   Also of note: the service was quite good. Our server checked on on us twice during our meal, always made sure we had water, and didn't hover when we took a few extra minutes to chat at our table after we'd paid and our drinks were done."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place is amazing, it was a perfect setting for my group of 10 and everyone enjoyed their food, the atmosphere and their drinks.  The inside is rather intimate, cozy and dim, it's great for chit chat, drinks and great food with friends or on a date. The drinks are reasonably priced and the waiters were amazing. Friendly, attentive and very knowledgeable.  Food: Chicken Linguine  - amazing, 5/5. This was one of the BEST pasta's I have tasted at a restaurant. It wasn't overly heavy with sauce.The pesto was not over whelming which happens a lot but not this time. All the ingredients tasted fresh and the chicken was nicely grilled and apparent in the pasta.   Insomnia Burger- another great favourite. The beef they used for the patty you can tell was made in house and fresh. The aioli they use on this burger is absolutely to die for FYI. I enjoy that they pair the burger with mixed greens, fries & garlic aioli- A great mix of everything and they all work well together. I added sauteed mushrooms to mine- delicious and very good.  Location is also key to me and I find that it is nestled in a group spot. I will return with open arms and an empty tummy!"}
{"text":"Super cute restaurant, esp. if you go for dinner! The environment itself is so nice.  The service here is okay, even though the staff are kind, the waitress helping us could've came around a bit more to see if we were okay, getting to her was kind of hard.  The portions are small, so you might want to consider ordering a bit more than one plate (if it's an appetizer). The food, however, was good."}
{"text":"Really great spot. We were here for a friends party. Service was great and friendly.   Snacks we're great too. Love it all.  This place seriously can not get any better!"}
{"text":"Great prices and the food is decent but its not a place I would really crave. I had a few appetizer plates to share and the nachos were the highlight. Overall, a good place to go for simple eats."}
{"text":"Insomnia a really nice place for a brunch with some friends. The atmosphere is friendly and feels like I am at home. The food was fresh, and the quality was great. Its right yelp named it comfort food. I had ordered the Steak Sandwich, and it was worth every buck on it. The steak was cooked perfectly served with a Ciabatta bun, and the Chipotle Aioli went really well with the steak. We had also, order an eggs benedict, served with a side of honey home cooked style potato that was very delicious as well! Overall, I had a blast dinning here, well definitely be back if I am around the area.  Environment: 4/5 Service: 5/5 Food: 5/5  Overall: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"I went to Insomnia with a friend for dinner on a wintery Saturday night. We arrived around 6 p.m. with no reservations and were fortunate to be seated as the place filled up rapidly. I was impressed with the menu choices and finally decided on the O.G. Mac & Cheese. My friend ordered a chicken pasta dish. We both ordered the house wine. Service was excellent without being intrusive and we were well taken care of. A tiramisu slice of cake completed the meal. The food was delicious and abundant.  My only complaint was the noise level. It was often tremendously loud and made conversation next to impossible. The Saturday evening time slot may have been the reason.  However, I will certainly return to Insomnia and will recommend this restaurant to my friends."}
{"text":"Because this place is walking distance from my house, I went to grab some quick food. And it was the worst restaurant-related mistake I've ever made in my hungry life. This place doesn't deserve to be hopped off at on-the-way-elsewhere. This place deserves its own hour in your busy calendar. Not only are the portions huge but the staff are friendly, free spirited (like, I don't feel like I'm their cranky aunt who's gonna die soon so they're being compulsively polite to stay in the will). Get salmon for breakfast (yes, you can), some latte, lay back and enjoy."}
{"text":"Usually when you're a solo diner holding a voucher, you're treated like a three-headed leper: the host and server roll their eyes in anticipation of a puny tip, you're seated at the dishwasher, and your entree never looks quite as good as that at the neighbouring table who ordered the same thing.  But Insomnia was the BEST restaurant I've ever tried on a voucher, and it's the first one where I'll be happy to return even without a voucher (gasp!).  The voucher excluded their popular brunch hours; so I reserved a table for one for early Sunday evening. I got a confirmation e-mail from an actual person, not a robot, and was greeted warmly at the door.  (I saw my name handwritten in their book.)  I got a nice seat inside with good lighting so that I could read comfortably.  I showed my voucher right away so that they could tell me which specials were off-limits, but lo and behold there were no restrictions!  (what!?)  I was able to order off the $25 3-course prix fixe menu, which had all the items I had planned to order and basically threw in the dessert for free.  My starter was the pulled pork taco: a very generous serving of chipotle pulled pork with some nice sauces and slaw and the pleasant surprise of pea shoots, which really made the dish.  I inhaled it.  My main course was the chicken and waffles.  This was a huge portion of chicken - 2 boneless leg/thigh quarters: crisp on the outside, and so juicy and tasty on the inside.  The waffle was the single-best waffle I've ever had: not too sweet, perfectly crisp.  The maple-butter soaks into both the chicken and waffle without making them soggy.  There is also a nice red cabbage slaw (buttermilk-based, I think) on the side.  This was the best version of the dish I've had since I visited South Carolina ages ago.  Good thing I had skipped lunch earlier; otherwise I'd have needed a styrofoam clamshell.  If I had one suggestion for the food, it would be to give the diner the option to spice it up a bit.  There was a hint of jalapeno somewhere in the waffle, but it wasn't enough for my asbestos tastebuds.  Some chopped jalapenos on the side would elevate everything for heat seekers like me.  Dessert was a nice pink velvet cake: a strawberry-flavoured variation on the original.  It was beautifully plated with fresh strawberries and cream, and the cake itself was moist and flavourful.  I prefer a standard red velvet, but this was well done.  Service was quick, friendly, and efficient.  I wish the server would have introduced himself by name so I could mention him here.  It's the service and professionalism that will be bring me back.  I appreciate that this restaurant understands what a voucher is supposed to do: draw in people that would otherwise never visit and impress them so that they'll return on their own.  Most places just wind up resenting voucher-holders as margin-suckers, making you wonder why they ever issued one in the first place.  Insomnia is a class act."}
{"text":"This is a very cozy restaurant with a full bar, not what you would expect from the outside. We came here with a party of 15 people and the staff was really nice and accomodating. I personally didn't order any food but everyone did and it looked very good! Nice portion sizes, fresh food, lots of flavor - not your typical bar grub. All my friends liked it."}
{"text":"Fun place for drinks late at night. I've been here a few times with different group sizes. The few times I've been have all been after 10pm so it gets quite busy with the drink special. I'm a big fan of their Toronto Sour. They also have some food like chicken wings and nachos late at night but it wasn't too memorable to be good or bad. Service was pretty good for the most part. Bobby served me twice and she's very energetic. Other times, when I came with big groups, service was not as great as expected."}
{"text":"I used to head to Insomnia for a drink or something to eat before a show at Lee's Palace all the time, but the place seems to have fallen out of fashion lately with new restaurants opening up in the neighbourhood and I haven't been as often in recent months. The music on the weekends is upbeat (usually a mix of deep house and drum 'n bass) and I highly recommend the fries with garlic aioli - extremely tasty!"}
{"text":"These fine folks get 5 stars for both service and critically - flavour. We arrived for brunch on the recommendation of our daughter. The menu is chocked full of amazing sounding dishes - many of them accompanied by the home fries slathered in their homemade ketchup.  Ketchup is too simple a word. The sauce is packed with spice and flavour but not with fire. Great addition to any plate. If you like more firery flavours - do not forget to ask for their homemade hot sauce. It will come presented beautifully and is a great up kick if that as what you like! Great spot on Bloor."}
{"text":"Love their homemade fries! Amazing portions. Small unit, so be sure to make reservations as there are usually a lot of people."}
{"text":"Well finally checking this off my bookmarks! Yum! Bobbie was amazing!! She was so efficient, high energy, friendly, helpful, attentive, gave great suggestions !!! Can someone make her a manager before she gets scooped up to work elsewhere ? My engineering friends were saying they need someone like her to work with them! Ha. Great customer service!   Ok on to the food. I've never had fried chicken and waffles before and from what I heard from friends that have tried it, was just that it was - well tastes like fried chicken and waffles no big deal. Well no, to me, this was delicious! Was afraid the chicken would be dry but nope super crispy crunchy outside and juicey tender inside! And rightfully drowning in yummy maple spicy sauce - I'm not a spice person but it was good! Very filling yes but still good.  My friends all liked their dishes and the chocolate dessert and xrated vacation martini I had was good (could have been a bit more fuller in the glass, but still sweet and yummy - just what I was craving). Ambiance was busy and full and kinda loud - so not ideal for an intimate dinner date- but lovely candlelight and nice rustic decor.  Whatever, decor really doesn't matter- food and service was amazeballs. Great night with friends too."}
{"text":"I love this place but last Sunday when i was there my eggs benni should have been more runny in the middle of the egg!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this while looking for a place near the theater we were going to. Great find! Very very very gluten free friendly. Separate GLUTEN FREE FRYER!!! My sister is always on the hunt for GF fries. They were great especially with the chipotle aioli.  Other GF things we had which were good - kale salad, harvest salad. The burger and the fried chicken sandwich had by our brothers were good to. Not the greatest beer selection but the black manhattan was good! And thanks to our great waitress for the bourbon sour shots she gave us free of charge."}
{"text":"El lugar es muy bonito, acogedor, moderno, la comida es muy buena y con un excelente sabor, el pollo estuvo exquisito! Muy buena atención."}
{"text":"The day I discovered Insomnia, I was pretty sure my coolness factor was so high that it could have been mistaken as an item on Insomnia's menu.  I'd say it is the best martini bar around (they've got well over 30 to choose from) and the food is delicious. I won't go there to eat by myself because I don't really think it's the type of place to do that, but if I have friends in tow who are willing to go beyond the student budget, you can bet that there will be one Rosedale pizza on our table and a smattering of martini glasses.  Insomnia has DJs spinning every night so it can be noisy with the music and the crowd, so I'd recommend going on a weekday night to celebrate something, or if you're me, going at 1 PM after watching Obama's inauguration at the Bloor Cinema. No crowds at 1 PM.  The service is great, Thursday nights have cheaper martinis ($5-6),  and if you or your company could possibly be carded, just be sure to bring ID. You're technically in UofT territory.  After two years, I still think their ceiling lights are really cool."}
{"text":"Great food great service great atmosphere! I visited while on vacation in Toronto and I highly recommend that you check it out!"}
{"text":"Came back to try out other dishes as we were invited back by the owner. I asked him before hand what I should try instead of what I got last time and he suggested the egg benedicts. I invited my boyfriend to come this time for brunch again and I had the one with smoked salmon (Charlotte) while he had the one with pulled pork (Memphis). Both of our dishes were good and very filling! but my boyfriend said mine was a bit better. I also tried Richard's ice tea and that was really good! We also got mimosas and when have those ever been bad lol. Our server was also very pleasant and made our visit very fun. Also perhaps the other time was just an off day because the music wasn't loud at all this time it was at the right level. So I've updated my review to a 4-star (from 3) to recommend coming here for a good brunch.   Previous review below:  Came here because it was on blogTO's best places for brunch. If you don't wanna feel out of place you should be a millennial (my mom looked out of place here). Hipster you will fit in more but not necessary. Music was super loud too loud for my taste for brunch but it was all 90s pop so that was fun. Got the super huge French toasts which looked awesome but only tasted so-so bcos too much cream cheese I could only taste cream cheese. I've had better French toast. My mom's food with poached eggs was ok the best part was the seasoned potato. Final verdict is its ok but not impressive enough to come back."}
{"text":"We had a really amazing time at this spot while we were visiting. The atmosphere and food did not disappoint and we are glad we ended up making the stop.   We came for brunch and left with a hunch we would've back to eat here again next time we came. The drinks were delicious and the food came to the table and hot and ready to be eaten right then."}
{"text":"I just finished an internet spiral wherein I was reminded just how much everyone, especially Toronto's yupster population, hearts brunch. Insomnia has been doing leakfast right for years, and I thought it was high time I tossed them some love.  The famed potato things have been mentioned to death, but in case for some ungodly reason you are only reading my Yelp review and using it to guide your order, I'm going to mention them. Get. The. Potato. Things. They are home fries that have been cooked in ketchup in a way that can't be explained or replicated.   Moving on.  I usually go for their Charlotte Benny and I add spinach and extra Hollondaise sauce to perk her up a bit. I've somehow in all my visits never been here for dinner, but I can say that their late night martini menu is large and in charge. If it's really cause to celebrate, I recommend strolling in for a late brunch and turning your eggs and $5 mimosa into a martini'd afternoon.   PEPPER POINTS for their Yelp check in offer. $10 once you spend $50. Word."}
{"text":"Decided to come try the brunch menu and  to use the gift certificate. Was quite impressed with the whole meal. Ordered the fruit smoothie and the pulled pork eggs benedict. First time having eggs benedict and if this is what it's like everywhere, this has become the best breakfast dish ever. The plate comes with mixed greens and home fries. By far the best home fries ever ! Covered in the legendary sauce, it was sweet and savoury with a hint of spice. Cleared the entire plate even the slice of orange garnish.  The service was much better this time, the waitress was friendly and helpful. She was always smiling and around to help. Only complaints were the chair covers and washroom. Sat at the back, on those single black seats and can see the white stains which made it a little uncomfortable to sit on. Also, should be around time to renovate the washrooms. It's a little old and run down.  Overall, will definitely come back for weekend brunch and order more eggs benedict."}
{"text":"Went here with a bunch of people for dinner. Not a bad choice, there were roughly 10 of us there. The waitress was friendly, offered her opinion on what was good and what wasn't. I ordered the steak and asked for medium rare, the steak wasn't that great and it was more-so to the medium side than the rare. The place wasn't expensive, normal restaurant pricing for the type of food we got. Overall, it's not a bad place to eat if your in the area."}
{"text":"Did Sunday brunch with 6 friends, great food, coffee refills, great atmosphere, took reservation and they split the bill without us asking which I appreciated!"}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to come back here for brunch and it was amazing!!  I specifically came in for brunch this weekend because I noticed Insomnia's Instagram page had posted a photo of a THANKSGIVING EGGS BENNY! That's right, take it in.   I legitimately had no words, it was brilliant. I even kept the cranberry sauce on it and I'm not a huge fan. Everything about it was perfection. The hollandaise sauce complimented the thanksgiving ingredients quite nicely. I also like how they give salad and home fries, yes for greens! The home fries were a little saucy in my opinion, I'd probably order a reduced amount if not none next time, or more salad!  My boyfriend ordered the oven baked pancakes, the chocolate banana flavour and OHHH MYYY GOODNESS!! The banana was baked into the pancakes and the chocolate was drizzled on top, phenomenal! My boyfriend said it was too chocolatey, i said he was nuts and was ready to swap my meal with his :p  Needless to say we were both STUFFED afterwards ! I forgot to mention we had mimosas with our brunch and they were great. I got the grapefruit flavour! Did not expect to have options  Overall it was a great experience and awesome service! Thanks to our waiter Scott- you rocked!  Can't wait to come back :)"}
{"text":"Certain places just feel right. Insomnia is one of them. And if we'll dive into some logical reasoning, it simply satisfies all the basic criteria, hence gets a solid approval overall.  Like, location? Bloor and Bathurst, readily accessible by streetcars and subway. Not the most scenic corner of the city, but not an ugly one either. Easy to find and easy to reach.  Food? Restaurant level. Kitchen work is absolutely wonderful, not a single miss! I am picky about the food quality, and Insomnia is a excellent choice, right on.  Service? Lightning-fast, polite and friendly. Those guys appear out of nothing when you need them, and disappear when you don't. They also don't forget to smile and take care of the stuff on your table without delay.  What else may be expected from a cafe - a place where we are supposed to meet someone for a more or less serious one-on-one chat? I guess Insomnia does everything just about right, and can be a sample for the rest of its peers.  Absolutely recommended."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 3.5 Good food quality. Small portions for high prices leave me wanting more. Brunch is better than dinner menu. Very intimate and nice. Great waitstaff."}
{"text":"Joining the Insomnia fans, I really enjoyed my dinners here! Definitely very pricey, but they have an impressive menu:  - Fried chicken on maple syrup waffles $18 - It was a tower of waffles and chicken. Basically it was (from top to bottom) fried chicken, waffle, fried chicken again, waffle. How elegant. - Smoked chicken taco $6 - this was delicious!! and spicy. You get two taco's (the small kind) on a small plate. - Smoked chicken pizza (Cabbagetown $15) - I guess it wasn't a smart idea to get the fried chicken waffle AND ALSO chicken pizza, because the pizza pales in comparison. Still the pizza was delicious!   I just noticed I've ordered only chicken here.  The draught beer selection is just okay. Service is fantastic. I really enjoy the atmosphere here at evening/nights. It gets busy but service stays great.   Tables for two are really, really tight. All tables further back of the restaurant are for two -and you will hit someone when getting in/out of your seat. The guy next to me had his elbow on the armrest, which by the way blocks half the \"aisle\" between our tables. That aisle is only 30cm wide. So yes, naturally, I kicked him when walking through. But he saw me coming, what a jerk!  This is my hangout spot before my Hot Docs movie (the cinema is across the street). Great place!!"}
{"text":"The setting is very intimate, at times cramped.  The service was great but the food was average.  Still worth checking out."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork benedict.  Average, did not experience anything special here. The pics looked amazing so expectations were too high. Had better at other places for less."}
{"text":"Has been my go-to brunch place for almost a decade (when they used to give water bottles...)  It has only disappointed once.    A big fan of the pancakes, although I don't get them often.   I have come to enjoy the coffee with the cinnamon inside.    If you didn't realise there was cinnamon, I hope it doesn't ruin the taste for you!   One of my friends really doesn't like it.  HOME FRIES!   Holy crap these things are god damn delicious.   They are fried and coated in what seems to be some special bbq / wing sauce.   A real treat that keeps me coming back and makes a great meal fantastic.      The eggs charlotte (benny but w/smoked salmon) and huevos rancheros (get poached eggs with it instead of friend)  are my two regular orders.     Expect a short-medium line on Saturday/Sunday Morning.   Smaller groups (4 or less) are better than large groups as they are easier to accommodate.    Service ***1/2 (sometimes they are very busy) Food **** Ambiance ***  ps.  It's also a great martini bar in the night!"}
