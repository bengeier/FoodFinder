{"text":"Read the reviews!! This place is terrible!!!  I ordered the safest items- fried rice and dumplings. Fried rice was old, slimy meat, over soyed, gross... The dumplings were not sealed won ton wrappers around a small amount of ... I don't know what. Did not resemble pork. I ate 2 bites of each and threw it out."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and it was a disappointment , the food was so dry and had no flavor! Not to mention it was nicer outside then it was in the restaurant to eat, they forgot my chicken on my order it was just veg's and dry rice, then they laughed about it as I told them! I would not recommend this place at all to anyone, my stomach had cramps the rest of the day! The bathroom was so gross, it looked like it hasn't been cleaned in a very long time!"}
{"text":"I love the wor wonton we eat a couple of times a month. Always friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"Never again. I've ordered from here for a few years and the food was pretty good before the new management. I had food delivered and the order was wrong (as it had been a few times in the past). I called to see if they would correct it, and not only did the man I spoke to not offer to replace my order, he told me I was wrong. He argued with me for about 10 minutes as to why I was wrong. He was rude, dismissive, and ended the call saying \"Whatever\" and hung up on me. The food isn't that great and after that horrible service, I'll never go back there!"}
{"text":"Not very good at all, kinda wished we ate taco bell that day. Much better Chinese food close by."}
{"text":"I ordered a tofu dish, vegetable egg fu young and spring rolls. Everything was overly oily and SWEET ! I had about 15% of the total food ordered and decided I can have no more. Gave away the rest or decided no seconds tomorrow though I had splashed $20 or so on delivery. The worst Chinese food in my life IMHO."}
{"text":"Ill start with the food! The rice was either well under cooked or old! I ordered the orange chicken based on the rating posted on the front door. It was very chewy and lacked flavor. The price is decent but you get what you pay for! The entire establishment including the restroom was very poorly maintained. Dirty soda fountain, tables, counter tops and poor lighting, I would not recommend for lunch or dinner! Staff was friendly however seemed more concerned about managing bills at a side bar and working on the computer rather than maintaining a clean environment."}
{"text":"I should have known that something was off.  Cashier was behind counter picking his teeth was a toothpick but i didn't think much of it because he was the cashier and not the cook. So I continued with my order because it was semicheap.  I didn't enjoy my food because the color of the food was off. Took a bite of the cheese ragoon and it looked and tasted gross. I didn't eat the meal.  Overall: Expensive if you don't eat it what you paid for.   Warning: check out the place before you place the order."}
{"text":"First my husband and me were going to subway next door. And we said what the heck let's give it a try. Biggest mistake ever. The food was just horrible. Nice customer service. But bad food. I'll never go back again."}
{"text":"I don't really get all the negative reviews.. We ordered pork wontons which were delicious. We also ordered beef w broccoli and chicken lo mein... Nothing spectacular but still good... I liked it enough. They also have Thai iced tea yummmm"}
{"text":"The worst Chinese food I've ever had don't waste your time or money. Will never go back my wife and I were sick all night."}
{"text":"When it came time to order lunch for the office, I knew exactly where to go - Ho Ho Ho Gourmet.  I don't recommend dining in, definitely a take-out or delivery place.  The vegetables are perfectly cooked, fresh and crispy.  The staff is very friendly.  The prices are inexpensive.  The service is fast.  The food is hot. Delicious!   I've been there 4 times, and always good food.  It's also interesting to note that when I've been there in the evening, there is usually a staff member taking a dinner break and eating their food; that's the sign of a good place to eat."}
{"text":"A few years ago this was one of the best Chinese restruant in Vegas.  Now it is far behind Panda. I tried the general chicken for lunch and ate only the noodles.  The chicken was old and very hard crusted.   I broke crusted chicken open to get to the meat which was hard and dark brown.  Sorry Ho Ho Ho, but never again.  oh, the first clue was nobody there at 12:30pm."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous. Bought their food from Postmates and I got so sick! Somehow the chicken is doused in sauce yet has no flavor whatsoever. That should've been my first warning sign. The cream cheese wontons are exactly that, just hot cream cheese. Not even onion or imitation crab, stuffed in a dry wrapper. I normally don't bother writing reviews, but I figured I should save someone else from getting violently ill from this place like I did."}
{"text":"NoNoNo to Hohoho  Chinese food should not be so greasy that the grease comes in its own takeout container.  Nor should it be so salty that you could swim in it, saving yourself a trip to the dead sea.  $50 in food went into the trash after two bites. No one should suffer more than that. The rats in the city dump will be bloated for weeks if the grease doesn't clog their arteries first."}
{"text":"the food was just fine,  i've come to expect very little from chinese food so it's hard to be disappointed when an hour latter it doesn't feel like i've just eaten a brick of grease.  The service on the other hand was terrible.  When i placed my order for delivery i wasn't told a price which was kind of odd in my mind but at the same time i had the menu in front of me and 5.50 plus 5.00$ isn't all that hard.  I was told it would be thirty minutes which seemed kind of long for an order of fried rice and bbq pork, but it was  just before 6:30 so maybe they were busy.    Finally almost an hour later my food shows up,  the delivery guys tells me the price almost 17 dollars,  i asked why so hard and he told me delivery charge.  I live nearly right around the corner and it's a five dollar charge for delivery.  I'm now upset my cheap lazy dinner has now turned into an expensive dinner,  i get my change and am closing the door and the delivery guy asks for a bigger tip.  I had only given him a dollar cause he hadn't really given me any service and that five dollar charge should be paying him handsomely.  I can understand being upset over a tip and i was low but to ask for more money after surprise charges doesn't seem fair or good business at all."}
{"text":"Nasty nasty nasty ... Chicken brown And dry and nasty. I ordered teriyaki chicken And chicken fried rice ... Absolutely no flavor not good disgusting... Made me sick .. I literally threw up. NOT WORTH IT DONT DO IT"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try the lemon chicken but when I got home, they forgot the lemon sauce. It's basically just breaded chicken. SO ANNOYING. And the hot and sour soup doesn't taste like it. Mongolian tofu was good though. But still, blergh!!"}
{"text":"Yikes...how do you screw up Orange Chicken? This place did...and biting into their crab wontons was more like biting into a clump of cold fried cream cheese. No good...first and last time."}
{"text":"Disgusting is an under statement!! Doesn't even deserve a star. What a waste of money.  Be warned the food is nasty, we ordered general tso's and sesame chicken... neither were even close to what they should taste like.. the food was burnt and chewy. The lo mein is awful. Nothing good to say about the incompetent dtaff who told me twice that the forks and soy sauce was in the bag I checked and it wasn't.  I want my $30 back!!"}
{"text":"Awful! Worst meal I've had in Vegas. Placed an order for a delivery- granted we only live round the corner. Was quoted an hour for delivery- it finally arrived after 1 hour and 20minutes. Food was warm, not hot. Food was disgusting, ordered 2 beef dishes that tasted exactly the same. Egg rolls just tasted of cabbage with black pepper, and the crab rangoons- either they had no crab in them or we didn't receive them at all.not feeling too great after the couple of mouthfuls we had either A massive let down and disappointment.  Definately go elsewhere.Big thumbs down from me."}
{"text":"First off let me say, I had delivery and it took almost 2 hours. I live 1/4 of a mile from the place.  It was raining and I thought I'd order delivery so I wouldn't have to walk in the rain as my car is in the shop.   My order:  Crab Rangoons, Hot and Sour Soup and Spicy Pad Thai.  Crab Rangoons were HORRIBLE.  Very soggy and very FLAT.  Hot and Sour Soup:  It was hot, fresh from the stove but had no spicy heat to  it at all.  I ordered it extra spicy.  It also was not sour.  It was edible and since I waited two hours for my order I was VERY hungry.  I ate it.  Spicy Pad Thai.  The menu says \"Pad Thai\"  It does not say \"shrimp, or chicken\" on the menu and they don't give you a choice.  I \"assumed\" it was veggie pad thai and any meat would be by request.  I'm Vegetarian.  I get the pad thai and it is full of chicken and shrimp!! Ok..fine...I picked it all out.  I'm dying from starvation by this time. LOL I dig in..and the only thing that was \"pad thai\" was the noodles.  There was no flavor, no spice, it was just greasy noodles.  That went straight into the trash.  I wish I could give this place \"minus\" stars! Won't ever order from there again.  On the flip side, I advise anyone reading this to order from New York Chinese on Lake Mead.  I always get my order in 20-30 minutes and everything is always PERFECT!"}
{"text":"Customer service was great but both the chicken dishes we ordered were chewy and un-apetizing. The cream cheese wontons were ok but expect a sweet dish if you order these."}
{"text":"After dropping off the car at Midas for an oil change, we decided to grab lunch. One kid wanted Subway. One wanted Chinese food. Lucky for us, Subway and Ho Ho Ho are right next to each other. The kid who wanted Subway must have read the Yelp reviews and knew to go with the sandwich. Lucky her.   After a quick stop at Subway , we walked like three steps over to Ho Ho Ho. Ordered beef and broccoli lunch special with chow mien, and a large entree size Mongolian beef. The food was not great but I've had worse (China Tango, I'm talking to you. Oh wait, they were so bad, they shut down some time ago.). My gripe really is with the portion size. We barely had any meat in either the beef and broccoli or the Mongolian beef. Paying $20 for a lunch special plus an entrée, I expect more than 4 pieces of meat in each dish. Of the two meat dishes, the Mongolian beef was the bigger disappointment in that it was mostly onion. Like an entire onion sliced up. Not good. At all.    Also, the restaurant was super smoky. Soda foundation was sticky, like greasy sticky.   There are plenty of so-so Chinese places in town. Go eat at one that gives you a real serving of what's in the title of the dish."}
{"text":"I love their Lo Mein!! I love the customer service. They cook it fresh and it's delicious! I also LOVE their Boba tea when I need a caffeine kick! I saw the other horrible reviews and I would 100% disregard! They've been open for a longtime.... at least as long as I've lived in Vegas (15 years). Great Food!!!"}
{"text":"Most post to Yelp after an especially good or bad experience.  I have eaten food from Ho Ho Ho many times, for about 20 years now, since when they were at Sahara and Rainbow.  The food is usually pretty good.  Certainly a step above Panda Express, in my experience, and almost on par with PF Chang's, but for lower prices.  I recommend the spicier dishes."}
{"text":"I only am giving this restaurant two stars because the gentleman behind the counter was so amazingly sweet. I ordered the Generals chicken and WOW....it was so over-cooked that the meat inside like shoe leather. My friend ordered the shrimp fried rice and it was so white there wasn't any soy sauce in it at all- negative flavor. I did end up throwing mine away. Sad because it's so close."}
{"text":"Ordered TO GO.  Was in the neighborhood so decided to try.   Ordered Lemon Chicken.  The chicken was so hard, my best knife could hardly cut through it.  The lemon sauce was good.  The rice was hard and crunchy, so must have been old, it was not edible.  Also ordered Lo Mein, which had a good flavor, but something was hard in it and once I got it out from my tooth, wasn't sure what it was, but it was hard enough to where I could have broken a tooth.  Once I almost broke a tooth, had to toss it.   Maybe it was petrified garlic.  This food is not \"Fresh and Healthy\" as advertised.  The Vegetables Delight were slimy and mushy.  Also, lunch was supposed to come with Crab Ragoon and Fried Won Ton.  I am unable to eat crab so asked if they could double the Fried Won Ton for the Crab Ragoon that I didn't want.  I was told, \"yes\" but that didn't happen.  Just as well, the Fried Won Ton was awful also."}
{"text":"It was ok, the delivery was very good, 15 mins tops. Maybe because I have a Chinese last name...they are skimpy in the shrimp, the terriaki chicken was too saucy and the rice was dry. The veggies were good and so was the beef lo mein. If I were to go there again l would stick with the lo mein dishes. Large portions for a good price."}
{"text":"This review is take out only - have never eaten inside restaurant. This place is not gourmet- but it's fast & convenient. My daughter loves the orange chicken & plain lo mein (one of the only places we can find without all the veggies/meat mixed in). We have tried other food here - but not too great. We stick to the same order & know exactly what to expect. Only one time was it over cooked & meat dried up inside (end of the night)."}
{"text":"Last nite we tried out this Chinese take-out for the 1st time.  The guy who took our order was very enthusiastic & kept remarking how great everything on the menu was.  Wow! We were excited...I told him if it's as good as you say, we'll be back!  We ordered... Chicken Kung pao,  beef broccoli, &  Singapore noodles.  Everything smelled so  good!  When we got home & started plating the food...I noticed how dark colored the sauce was in the chicken & beef dish. Also it was as if I ordered a vegetable dish as the chicken was thinly sliced & diced, loaded w/ onions & very little other vegetables. Also w/the beef, lucky if there were 5 small pieces!  And the noodles....ugh!   Thankfully we ordered the small portions. Obviously the customers who frequent this joint doesn't know how good Chinese Food can really be!  I am part Chinese from Hawaii, and people back home would NOT patronize this restaurant!  What a disappointment!  We will never return!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from this place and it was gross! I was high af and still couldn't stomach any of the 5 items I bought. What a waste of $30. Order somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Used to be better. Beef chow fun had hardly any beef in it. Walnut shrimp over cooked. Chicken Tsao over cooked too much fatty chicken. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Pass. I should know better than to challenge the Yelp community.  The reviews are spot on.  Mongolian beef is mostly onion, the fried rice is greasy.  Two other dishes were just blah."}
{"text":"Save your money- go to Panda Express. That's a shame I feel Panda Express is higher quality than this place. I ordered teriyaki chicken, shrimp chow mien, orange chicken, egg rolls and white rice. First red flag was the broken soft drink fountain they had - the lemonade just produced the syrup, no actual lemonade. The orange chicken was obviously stale. The meat was like chewing plastic. The teriyaki chicken was disgusting, how hard is it to at least pour some teriyaki sauce over some grilled chicken, at the least. The sauce they use is a  gravy of some sort, I could honestly place it on top a bed of mashed potatoes. The white rice was hard and must have been a leftover batch from yesterday or hours before. The egg rolls were mediocre, a little greasy but whatever. The only thing that was decent was the shrimp chow mien, there were only 4 or 5 shrimp (large order) but at least the taste was there. This was my first and most definitely my last visit to \"NO NO NO\"!"}
{"text":"We have ordered from this place a few times now and they are always fast and our food is always good. Their fried rice is amazing and so is their sesame tofu. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Made a delivery via phone, they helped me well and didn't cause any issues, prior to ordering I phoned 2 other places who couldn't understand basic English. Order went really smooth and easy, employee on the phone was helpful and professional. Food came within 20 minutes, it was hot, tasty and well portioned! Will order here from now on!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese takeout place I've ever ordered from! Very friendly and make food fresh. When I arrive to pick up my order, they are cooking my food in the big woks. My favorite items are the salt and pepper wings... You get addicted, and the garlic chicken, and sautéed green beans! My friends and I have ordered there at least 30 times and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Brings a tear to my eye that this place is no longer awesome. They have forgotten items and burned my food. I am going elsewhere. China Tango it is."}
{"text":"fast, semi-cheap takeout. place is kinda dirty on the floors but it didn't bother me.  transfriendly- should be very accomodating plus if they talk shit and you don't speak chinese you won't know anyway!"}
{"text":"Don't eat here smell of cigarette smoke so I looked in the back and the cook was chopping vegetables with a knife in one hand and a cigarette in the other."}
{"text":"Typically when I order from here for lunch the place is pretty decent. However when I decided to order delivery for dinner. The tofu dish that I ordered had crumbled up dried out and burned pieces of tofu. They were absolutely inedible. He could not even chew them or eat them.   The dish was soaked in a sauce that was so salty and burned my tongue. After this experience and then reading some of the yelp reviews I will never ever order from here again."}
{"text":"I actually like this place. Good combination plate dinners. It's Chinese food it'll all make you sick but it goes down so good. And if I'm ordering it from anywhere it's Ho Ho. Fast delivery to."}
{"text":"Hot and sour soup - Oily/greasy.   Fried wonton - Ok...just ok. Would've been better if I received the hot mustard packets I asked for.   Garlic Shrimp lunch special with lo mein - 6 pretty small shrimp. Garlic sauce is more like a thick syrup (I prefer a sauce). Lo mein was just noodles covered in soy sauce (no veggies, nothing).   I asked for extra extra hot mustard packets and received 3 soy sauce packets."}
{"text":"My order was correct and it was on time but the teriyaki chicken wasnt that great. The cashew chicken was better but my small order had 80% water chestnuts.. Which I don't even like so I only got a couple small pieces of chicken.. For 6+ dollars."}
{"text":"the food is unbeatable for the price, everything on menu is great.  Place is a total dive."}
{"text":"Well first and last time. I got the sweet n sour chicken for me & the Beef n Broccoli for my husband. His was nice and hot except for the rice which after you put sauce on is ok. I have never ever gotten sweet n sour sauce that was stone cold. Not even warm. Over cold rice not good. The batter on the chicken is very thick and heavy same used on the fried shrimp which my husband had no flavor. Will save for left over tomorrow and heat up my self maybe it will be better. Should have asked for some chinese mustard or plum sauce for the shrimp usually it comes with some kind of sauce. Delivery was on time and driver was very nice. Too bad really wanted to find a good place for chinese take out."}
{"text":"I stopped in this small Chinese place while my car was being worked on next door. Since moving to Vegas from the Bay Area I have had serious cravings for really good, authentic Chinese food. Specifically Egg Drop (Flower) Soup. I was impressed by the portions. I ordered a small ($2) and it was a huge serving - enough for two meals. The soup itself was full of flavor and so good, but it really lacked the extra corn and peas I'm used to having in it. I added on a side of steamed rice ($1) and some veggie egg rolls (2.50) to go along with it. The rice was somewhat stale... like it had been a day or two old, but again a massive serving. The egg rolls were slightly under-cooked but they were flavorful.   The service is fair, the young man was nice but not overly friendly. After I got my food I found him sitting at a side station watching a movie or something on his cell phone.   The cleanliness of the place is really lacking which is why I deducted stars, it is legit filthy in there. The soda machine is sticky and covered in dust, the tables are dirty, and the salt/pepper shakers look like they've NEVER been cleaned.  Also, I dined in while waiting for my car and food was served on paper/styrofoam and plastic utensils. I thought maybe it was an accident until another customer dining in got the same thing...didn't really bother me (especially since I'm sure the to go plates are cleaner than a real plate would be there) but I think it's something to mention (not gourmet at all).   All in all, if you can get past the cleanliness issues and just get your food delivered or to go, it's actually pretty decent. Although, I wouldn't recommend any seafood or meat items, the place is seriously dirty and I would question their practice of safe meat handling."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday bc they're menu was on our front door. Ordered but they didn't deliver to our area (weird since they delivered their menus) so we picked it up. I told my husband their kitchen looked very sketchy. He assured that he saw an \"A\" grade sign next to their soda machine. I'm 6 months pregnant and had to call in sick today since both my husband and I have been sick since last night. Come to find out they actually have a \"C\" grade and was just featured on Fox 5's Dirty Dining segment last week. Never eating hear again. Would love to get our money back."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm from the NYC. Chinese food there has its own unique style not found really anywhere else. So for me to compare, restaurants I've been to outside the city never really match up or do it justice. It certainly (NYC style I mean)  isn't \"authentic Chinese\" as in it typically isn't where the Chinese people tend to go. Of course that isn't the case in Chinatown, the Manhattan or Brooklyn Chinatown (we have two.) Anywho, this place isn't bad and out of several restaurants we've tried here this comes close to NyC style in a lot of respects but they're. Not perfect by any means. The selections we've tried we're limited so I will definitely try other items.   The Chow Fun which is a broad rice noodle was comparable to anything I've had in NY. the fried rice was at 60% but would order again. The sweet and sour shrimp was awful. It was extremely greasy and for a 1.5\" shrimp it was covered in 5\" of heavy batter... A very bad no no. This was extremely off putting as we're the egg rolls, free with a $10+ order. They're not NY style egg rolls by any stretch of the imagination. They're more like spring rolls which are usually light and airy, but these were dripping with oil. I wrapped it one in a paper towel and set it aside for an hour. The remaining towel was completely translucent with oil and I could probably tie it to a branch and use as a torch next time I'm in a cave.  I had the food delivered took less than a hour not too bad,but the driver who got $5 bucks as a tip was not rude, but curt and didn't seem thankful. He called me from outside my. Apartment door asking me what my apt number was I told him and he said he was outside. I said I'll be right there and went to through on a pair of shorts and a tee all about 20 seconds and the doorbell starts going off. I open the door and he was in mid-dial calling me again... SERIOUSLY!!!!  All in all I will order the Chowfun again. Never the S/S shrimp or egg rolls. I've heard the general Tso chicken is good so I'd go for that. I think I will try a new dish here and there to whittle down my list but other than that , I'd recommend the place but caution folks to be careful. I'm curious if anyone else from the BIG APPLE has tried this place?"}
{"text":"Nice staffs. Decent food. I recommend their Singapore Rice Noodles and Pad Thai Spicy Noodles."}
{"text":"I ordered the sweet and sour pork and it tasted horrible and stringy. The lo mein was tasteless like it came out of an oil can. I spit out the food and tossed what was left.    Yecch! I hope I don't get sick later. Never again!"}
{"text":"It was just bad. Chinese takeout isn't suppose to be great my any means but this was just awful. The food is cheaper than most places for a reason. My egg rolls were just cabbage inside them and my Pork Suey had 2 bits of pork and a ton of vegetables and even more sauce. Food was cold when it was delivered and it was pretty much just seasoned with a lot of salt. Delivery took 1 hour and 20 minutes and I live less than a mile away. I would highly recommend that you just stick with your regular Chinese takeout place and don't try something new tonight."}
{"text":"Chinese fast food in Summerlin. OK... cool. Took the family in for a Chinese food fix.   Cashier was super friendly and helpful. We ordered, sat down in the tiny store. Typical fast food joint. Not super clean and picture menus hanging everywhere.   Pork won tons were great. But were served on a paper plate and paper towel. Everything else was OK. Not great, but OK. Needed more chicken, less low mien.   We live in Chinatown, so I guess were are spoiled to expect \"Chinatown\" quality on the edge of Summerlin. Sorry Ho Ho Ho, we won't stop in a again."}
{"text":"My partner and I were exhausted from a long day of work and really did not feel like cooking. Rather than order in we decided to take a drive and see what our options were. As we  pulled into subway we saw Ho Ho Ho Chinese gourmet. We had recognized the place from previously ordering delivery. We decided to order the family dinner A. Lemon chicken and general tso's chicken, hot and sour soup and chicken fried rice. The lemon chicken was breaded fried chicken with a yellow sauce on the side. It was dry, and far from lemon anything. The general tso's chicken was just ok, not real tasty, the hot and sour soup was not sour or hot it's greasy and slimy soup. Needless to say we are both still hungry and threw most of this meal in the trash. Should of went to Subway. We will not be returning and threw out all mailers for this sad excuse of a gourmet Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"There is a disconnect here: Chinese Gourmet?  - I beg to differ.  It resembled Chinese in look and name only - unless of course you were a big fan of Chun King growing up, then you might like it.   The staff was worthless. Tried asking the guy what he would recommend and he was clueless - seriously clueless. He had not one single suggestion, as if to say \"hey bud, just pick something and go.\""}
{"text":"Overall the food is good. But I've ordered twice now where I've ordered chowmein with crispy noodles and they send soft noodles. Delivery so it's too much of a pain to have it reordered. Other than that, very good"}
{"text":"By far the worst Chinese food I have ever had, and I was forced to eat Army chow. Lol But it was seriously bad. I ordered orange chicken with white rice, my go to when trying a new place,  it was terrible, the worst I have ever had. The rice wasn't fully cooked and was clearly old and the orange chicken lacked flavor, was cold and hard. It also tasted old. I normally don't write reviews but it was so bad I felt obligated."}
{"text":"I was drunk and this food still tasted nasty. Absolutely awful... pretty pricey too, and the delivery took forever. $40 down the drain."}
{"text":"\"Ho Ho Hole in the wall\"  By Far the worst chinese food I have ever \"attempted to eat\"  I am so angry I wasted my money here.  My co-workers said it was great.... lol what a joke!!!!  Crap, crap, crap.  I got in my car and drove to Panda Express, and I hate Panda Express!!  I tried to feed it to my dog and she flipped me off!"}
{"text":"I am not giving this restaurant any stars. My husband is allergic to shell fish. I am pregnant. And I can not have shell fish either. When we called and place the order we told them specifically that we do not want the shell fish in the order. And the lady on the phone said that we can substitute the shell fish for something else. We told them what we wanted in replace of the shell fish. We waited 45 mins for the food it finally got to the house and they sent the shell fish And not what we order in the replace of the shell fish. The juice from the shell fish was all over the food that we got. We could not eat any of the food at all. My husband called them for three hours to take the food back and get our money back. Every time we called them they said a hour. A hour for the driver to come back and get the food and give our money back. We yet still have not received our money back from them.  If my husband have died from this by eating the shell fish. They would have a law suit. You can not even tell if it is shell fish it looks nasty. The food stinks. This is not a good restaurant at all. They can not even refund us our money back. When it is not our fault. We told them we could not have shell fish. This is not a goodi place t"}
{"text":"After ordering lunch for my daughter I started looking around. The counter is covered with a layer of gray dust. Super dirty place. I felt like throwing the food out. My daughter said to never bring her that food again. Not tasty"}
{"text":"Always fast service and my order has never been wrong. This is about the sixth time I have ordered from this place and have never been disappointed. I would have given them a five but have never eaten in house at their restaurant but I could imagine the in house service being just as good! Speaking of which, I think I'll do it next time so I can report back and let you guys know whether or not they deserve a five!"}
{"text":"Very bland white people Chinese.  Nothings cooked in the sauces they're supposed to be in.  Save yer money cuz it's pricey and go to Panda down the street instead."}
{"text":"Just had delivery from here.. 40$ family meal. I have never had such disgusting Chinese food then this. The sesame chicken was nothing but fried bread with just a small tiny bit of meat... And the egg drop soup was a disgusting slop of slime.. No exaggeration.. Just clear runny slime. The fried rice was cold and and dried out. Just horrid..."}
{"text":"I also didn't read the reviews before we ate here. Big mistake. I don't know why they still re-fry their chicken after all these negative reviews about how uneatable it is when they do this. The owner obviously doesn't care about their food quality. We couldn't eat the orange chicken. We returned it after one bite (we dined in)."}
{"text":"this restaurant and i use that term loosely so bad, i didn't even finish the meal.  we stopped at a gas station and threw it all out.  the bbq pork was dry with red sauce dumped all over it.  the fried rice was WAY overcooked, hard and for a combo i only found a couple of pieces of meat, but everything was so burned i really couldn't tell.  don't waste your time, joint was also dirty...bad experience.  no napkins either."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love! They are one of our favorite delivery places. Always fast, fresh and portions are huge!! The Crab Ragoons and Pot Stickers are sooooooo Good!!! Will definitely continue to order for delivery from Ho Ho Ho!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times.  However this will probably be my last time.   I got the mongolian beef lunch special and a hot and sour soup.   Mongolian beef.. probably about 8 pieces of beef and mostly onion. Should be called Mongolian onions.  Sauce was way too sweet.  $5.95.  What was really bad however was the hot and sour soup.  From the taste and texture I could easily tell it was from last night.  From my picture the soup I put on the box, almost looks like snot.  Having been in the restaurant business for many years I know that this is actually congealed cornstarch.  This pint cost $3.25.  I had one taste and spit it out.  Hot and sour soup costs like nothing to put together.  I know it's bad to waste.  But really....left over hot and sour soup... Just throw it out.  Don't save it for the next day."}
{"text":"This is our local Chinese take out place.  I hadn't been here in quite awhile because I've been getting Archi's Thai instead.  I got two large soups for us last night - one wonton and one hot and sour.  Both were well done.  Sometimes, the wonton can be a bit salty for my wife, but it was fine last night.    The prices may be a bit higher compared to some other places, but the taste and the convenience seal the deal for me.  Service is always so quick that I never call ahead."}
{"text":"Hate to do it but...  No No No Chinese Gourmet should be the name of this place!  I'm sorry but how do they do it?  Still in business after all these years?  The name itself of Ho Ho Ho was funny enough for me to visit ONCE, but unfortunately probably never again.  Funny name...not so fun food!  Eeeeek.  Wifey and I went for lunch one weekend on a whim since we were nearby.  We always passed it on Sundays near church and finally figured, \"Eh, why the Hell not?\"  Well...I now know why.  Place is not busy AT ALL.  I should take that as a sign like I usually do.  The prices seemed good enough to warrant a lunch special or 2, so that's what we did.  Ordered:  *Shrimp with Lobster Sauce *Pork Egg Foo Young  Lunch specials come with fried wonton, crab Rangoon, steamed or fried rice, or lo mein noodles.  Value for sure at under $7 for each special.  But that's about where all the good ends.  Food itself?  OMG - soooooo salty!  Soooooo artificially saucy!!!!!  Thick sauces over everything!  The Shrimp with Lobster Sauce was just WEIRD - clearish sauce with barely any shrimp in it, mixed with some random veggies.  Sauce didn't even taste like lobster!  No other taste but salty.  Pork Egg Foo Young was a ruse as well.  Totally frozen-type egg foo young patties fried (in old oil possibly since they were greasy), then topped with some dark soy-based salt that was you guessed it, SALTY.  Even worse, no pork at all in the egg foo young!  The little pork bits were in the SAUCE!  Who does that?  That's how I could tell their egg foo young was a frozen product and not at all fresh.  It wasn't very tasty.  The accompanying lo mein noodles we chose that came with the lunch special was no good either.  Basically noodles with some of their sweet (but still salty) teriyaki-ish sauce!  No veggies added!  Bah.  The fried wontons and crab Rangoon were basically an afterthought too, soggy.  We're lucky we had bottles of water with us for lunch because oh boy, we really needed them.  So much water to balance out all that salt!    About the only thing Ho Ho Ho Chinese GOURMET has going for them is their prices.  The food?  Not gourmet.  #nononochinesegourmet"}
{"text":"We used to order here before many times but after my recent order, I think I will not give it a try for awhile because the food have the same taste. It takes like oyster sauce from the noodles the beef with mushroom. Chix wing is ok but how can you go wrong with frying chix wings but I could be better and the porkchop - has a different taste. Doesn't taste fresh. Im so sorry."}
{"text":"the food here is horrible.   The crab rangoon had almost zero filling, the hot & sour soup was thick & jelly-ish with zero flavor and the fried rice was basically white rice sautéed in oil & soy sauce for color (no pork, shrimp or veggies to speak of).  Eat anyplace else with any rating & you'll be better off!!"}
{"text":"Should be called Ho Ho Horrible.  I am not a \"foodie\" and I didn't expect actual gourmet but this was worse than TV dinner quality.  I wouldn't pay $2 for this garbage."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time.  Order was called in & picked up (work lunch).  It was quite delicious.  I dont get all the bad reviews.  I did not pick it up so I cant vouch for the cleanliness of the place.  I can only say my lunch was tasty.  I got the mongolian beef & Pad Thai.  Both were a bit spicy for me even though they tasted good.  I will go again however next time, I will tell them NOT spicy.  The pad Thai I ordered with no shrimp & when I got it, they had put shrimp in it, which did not make me happy.  Hence the 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"Was looking for a dish I had with a white creamy sauce w/veggies but this is what I got - a gelatinous MESS! With all the Chinese options I'd try china gourmet or china 1 - they're much better   Or if you find yourself in china town (or China block lol) try pho Kim long (best pho) Joyful house or Sam woo ALLL GOOD!!"}
{"text":"If we could possibly rate this zero stars and tell you not to ever go that would be their rating. They even have an award for their orange chicken and it is completely mushy without any flavor.  We ordered so many different things excited to have a nice dinner and watch the hockey game. We ordered chicken dumplings which were the worst dumplings I've ever had and if I can take pictures I will. We ordered Kung  pow chicken, double fried pork, orange chicken, noodles, rice, and of course the chicken dumplings. My husband is from Washington and has been here for two years now. He said this is the absolute worst Chinese food he has ever eaten. Wish we would've gone to McDonald's and guess I never thought I would say that.   Complete waste of hard earned money.   After arriving we noticed how everything was so dirty. We don't even know how they got an a rating but we had already paid so we thought let's try it."}
{"text":"Terrible. I wish we would have read the yelp reviews before ordering. For whatever reason my mom didn't order from the usual Chinese place and we ended up with this. The crab rangoons looked like square little hot pockets and they were more melted cream cheese than anything - gross. The only thing half edible was the fried rice. We won't be back:("}
{"text":"The general tso chicken was awful. It was so hard that we could not eat it. Walnut shrimp was better but not by much. I'm not going to go back here because I'm not a big Chinese food person to start with and this reminds me why. Guy at the counter was amazing, I hope they somehow turn it around because he was so nice but they will need a cook overhaul if they want to succeed."}
{"text":"I would just say No No No.  The only thing that was decent was the Shrimp and snowpeas. The Mongolian beef and szchewan beef were 90% onions/ peppers and water chesnuts respectively. I know better than to go against Yelp reviews, but someone I know told me the food was good. Maybe you'll like it, but I did not like it at all. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I'm only rating a 4 since 5 stars is giving a description of 'As good as it gets'.  Well, I'm sure not everyone agrees that this place is as good as it gets, and yes I have a couple Chinese take-out/delivery places that I frequent so the description of 'Yay! I'm a fan\" I think will be just fine.  Back when I came out to Las Vegas in 2006 during a Summer internship, I needed to find a place to get good General Tso's chicken, my number one go-to Chinese dish that there's never a bad time for eating in my world!  A friend I met out here suggested the place Ho Ho Ho to me.  When I found out where it was located, I was very happy as it was a mere 6 minutes up the road from my parents house in Summerlin!  The General Tso's chicken that I ate was absolutely amazing! Very much like the General Tso's chicken I frequented from a place when I was in college during my last two years!  Yes, there's often a lot of breading more than chicken itself, but they've actually managed to modify the recipe over the last couple years to be a perfect, even distribution of both.  They also used to serve the chicken in a paper carton, and now they serve it in a nice easy to manage plastic container with a lid to secure the freshness!  They are also one of the only places I frequent that has duck sauce packets which I'm always dousing my steamed rice in!  I'm proud to say that I have been ordering from Ho Ho Ho for 10 years now and they can always rely on me to get my usual 'General Tso's chicken, no veggies, with steamed rice, pot stickers, and a Diet Coke!'"}
{"text":"Terrible. We ordered chow mien and got a package of crispy noodles smaller than my palm. Seriously?  This place is NOT Chinese and NOT gourmet.  The other food is over sauced, salty, and i must say i was underwhelmed.  Mostly, the lack of customer service or even taking responsibility for their wrongfully named \"CHOW MIEN\" was just deplorable.  No more...never again. China One up the street is 10x better. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is not gourmet, by any means, but it will do. Portions are huge, price is cheap, and it is consistently decent."}
{"text":"I give no stars!! This place is horrible!! The orange chicken was over cooked and the chicken was hard and rubbery! The hot and sour soup... Well that went right into the garbage disposal!! The shrimp and veggie dinner, Tasteless!!! The shrimp Lo Mein was horrible and tasteless!!! If things couldn't be worse, the fortune cookies SUCKED and were stale!!"}
{"text":"We live in the area and drive by this place almost every day, finally decided to stop by. Checked reviews after, and they mentioned poor service. We met the owner after having asked if its a family owned business. They hired workers who didn't feel like carrying on their dreams and weren't too kind to the customers, but the owner was super kind and helpful.  Pros:    People were quite nice  Did Chinese carry out, which usually has a bad rep, but this was the most authentic place I've been to that also offers delivery and such  They were honest that their soda machine was broken and gave us free canned soda  Cons:   Needs an update, a tad old-ish  Needs a dusting, display items have grey spots from it  Food wise, it was a bit dry but they weren't overdone with sauces and fillers like other places try to do   Overall not a bad experience"}
{"text":"I ordered, fried rice, cheese ragoons and orange chicken and everything was horrible.   I'll never order food from this place again."}
{"text":"Ordered it on Uber Eats.... first and last time.... the orange chicken was bad, felt like the batter or whatever it's covered in wasn't even fully cooked for some bites... other bites were hard when chewed. I regret not checking yelp first and seeing all the bad reviews. It just ended up in the trash, couldn't even finish it."}
{"text":"Sure, it looks a little more swank than your usual strip mall takeout place. It's so glossy it shines. But the portions are smaller than other similar restaurants, and the prices are higher. I also find the rice and fried items to be somewhat overcooked and dry. Their service is also slooow. Very, very blah."}
{"text":"Ok, it's not \"inedible\" as some people have described. That's a crazy exaggeration lol. I got sesame chicken and low mein and it wasn't even bad! Chicken was somewhat crispy and good flavor of the sauce. The low mein was tasty! A bit dirty inside but otherwise this place is just a typical Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Horrible is an understatement. I ordered lemon chicken  I got breaded hard over cooked chicken cut in 5 thin strips. I also ordered orange chicken which didnt taste like it. It tasted like frozen food being reheated. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DONT EAT HERE. Just drive an extra block and go to panda express. I rate this zero stars."}
{"text":"Never going back.  Gave them enough chances. Just got home with my order.  No rice.  Cold Soup.  Pisses me off when I am expecting a meal and get crap...and pay for it. This place really sucks."}
{"text":"Found this place while cruising through sumerlin and thought hey, Chinese should be great being in this neighborhood. I was wrong. The place was a decent size, but it was empty (first clue) and the guy behind the counter was  very helpful in discussing dishes, hence 2 stars, but the food was awful. Stale hard chicken, the rice was old and hard, and the broccoli was white (meaning freezer burned). The worker was nice but not nice enough to come back here."}
{"text":"The most absolutely disgusting food I have ever tried in my life..pure oily grease and cheap noodles. Will never return."}
{"text":"The WORST egg foo yung I have ever had the misfortune of attempting to digest.  These lumps of doughy, eggless transgressions cannot be described using \"family-friendly\" words. I still await the \"egg\" in this concoction. Where are the eggs? Who stated this was an egg dish? If it had been advertised as a bread product, I might understand the consistency, but this alleged egg product leaves EVERYTHING to be desired,   And, since I cannot send it back (UberEATS), I am here to warn all others to STAY AWAY from the egg-based products of this \"eatery:\" term used loosely."}
{"text":"Always decent and reliable food. Very impressed with the quick delivery!  I've tried this place several times, from ordering in advance for pick up or delivery and even stopping in on my way home and ordering take out, food is always reliable and the staff are personable and helpful."}
{"text":"We have had quite a bit of excellent Chinese food having lived in NYC and SoCal  We ordered vegan entrees and general Tso's chicken  Have to say all was excellent. Very flavorful. The chef seemed to really care about the quality and that the customers were happy  I highly reccomend it"}
{"text":"Do not come here this place does not care about your health or the risk of CEOs contamination the cook doesn't use gloves and grabs chicken beef and shrimp with the same hands"}
{"text":"DO Not eat here...they re-fried the chicken, it was sooooooo fricken hard, ate one bite and it went in the trash..my dog would not eat dis crap...."}
{"text":"Great food and portions!! Always fresh and tasty!! Owner always friendly & very pleasant!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened but they have gotten worse and worse this past yr.  Today I stopped in to get lunch and I ordered my usual order and the girl spoke so low I could barely hear a word she said ,they don't have small sizes anymore so I said fine and repeated what I didn't want in my food. So I paid and waited and take my order home , and lo and behold i have no food !!! She just plain did not put my order in just the stuff for my husband and daughter. I was so.mad I called them and she made up several excuses and then said well.drive back here, I didn't even let her finish that sentence. I said I do not live close enough to just  come back so you can charge me full price for your screw up. If she cannot speak up she shouldn't be taking orders,  I barely could hear her over the phone either.  They have lost our business until they get better service! And I ordered fairly frequently til recently, but no more !"}
{"text":"Just say NO NO NO to HO HO HO!   I made the mistake of using their restroom after I had just placed my order for garlic shrimp.  It was dirty, the sink had black dirt residue it was so filthy and the bathroom is also used as a storage facility. Although they had toilet seat covers in boxes, they were not stocked for use.  I was on lunch at work and decided on the garlic shrimp w/lo mein soft noodles.  There was very little shrimp, it was mostly water chestnuts, bamboo shoots and mushrooms. I really think it should be named garlic mushroom because that was all it was.  The lo mein noodles were even horrible as they were way too salty, thick and dry with zero flavor.  That was my first and last visit!  I have had some bad chinese food in the past however this really is the worst I have ever had no doubt!  It is an insult to associate the word gourmet in any way, shape or form with this disaster of a \"chinese\" restaurant.  NEVER AGAIN  MY MISTAKE FOR NOT READING YELP REVIEWS PRIOR TO VISIT AS I HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE. I WAS ON LUNCH FROM WORK AND DROVE BY AND STOPPED, IF I HAD READ YELP FIRST THEN I WOULD HAVE NEVER STOPPED TO DINE HERE!"}
{"text":"Ho ho ho was decent with dinner special it is slightly cheaper than Panda Express.  It sure can use a facelift as everything from tables, beverage machine was well worn.  The family meal has your choice of one appetizer like rangoons, an eggroll, main side  and your choice of rice or noodle.  It probably can only hold eight at a time there as the establishment was small."}
