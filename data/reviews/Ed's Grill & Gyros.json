{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch during the week. This is a small mom and pop Greek restaurant located next door to a Sprouts. It's clean. You order at the counter. You can see the whole kitchen when you are standing at the counter ordering. It looks very clean and organized. They have a large electronic menu overhead with pictures. The lady taking the order also cooked the food.   We ordered a gyro and a gyro salad. In a short time our food was ready and brought to our table. Everything was fresh. The gyro meat was tender and tasty.   Prices were reasonable.  This would be a nice place for a quick lunch if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I came looking to eat a hot dog and I saw that Philly Cheesesteak Sandwhiches were on the menu. I've been looking for a Philly Cheesesteak Sandwhich as good as the ones I ate in Philadelphia, so I gave it a whirl. Yep, so far best Philly Cheesesteak Sandwhich I've ate outside oh Philadelphia. I gave a piece to my father and he enjoyed the taste as well.  This spot knows what they are doing. The place is quiet, very clean."}
{"text":"Excellent gyros and fries! Delicious pita!  Very unique menu. They have babaganoush, tabouli lamb shank beef sandwiches. Everything was hot and fresh. Delicious crispy fries. Give it a try, we're coming back tomorrow!"}
