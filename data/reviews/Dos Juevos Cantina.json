{"text":"I ate at Dos Juevos Cantina the other day with some friends. We are huge Julio G fans and were quite sad to see it was gone. We still decided to give the new place a chance. Chips and salsa are a huge part of or dining experience and they passed our test. Hot and fresh every refil! The salsa was tasty and sweet. My beef tacos were very tasty and left me full, not the best ever...but good. My friends tamale was very rich in flavor and the green chilie sauce was pretty good too. The four star rating goes to our waitress Connie!!!!!!! Let me tell you..I have never had service that stood out this much ANYWHERE! I have eat at low class places (Denny's) and high class places (the compass room) and while the service may not have been bad it was not as good as Connie. She was so bubbly and had such a positive attitude! I don't think we ever had an empty bowl is salsa, chips, or margaritas/soft drinks. They were not slammed but they were busy and she was ontop of it all night! She really made us happy we stopped in for lunch and if all their servers are half as good as Connie...this business will survive!! Thanks Connie!! Oh and Trinity still talks about how you let her color a picture with pretty crayons lol \")"}
{"text":"I found a yelp deal for this place, and though I saw negative reviews, I decided to give it a try. I am glad I did.  There weren't a lot of customers, but it was a hot afternoon in August, and not many customers seems to be pretty typical for this time of year. I sat at the bar, and was immediately given a big glass of water (with lemon), which was much needed, and a basket of chips and salsa.   I ordered a frozen Margarita and the enchiladas (with green tomatillo sauce) and chose the roasted corn pudding and the Anaheim chile stuffed with sweet potato for my side dishes. My Margarita arrived right away, and my entrée shortly thereafter. The margs were on happy hour special ($3!) and was tasty. When my meal arrived, I was so intrigued by the sides, I ate them right away. Both were phenomenal,  and I am not exaggerating in the least! The Anaheim chile was stuffed with a baked - then mashed - sweet potato. No potato skin in it whatsoever,  as I read in a previous review, so it looks like they follow advice from yelp reviews... and the roasted corn pudding is out of this world! I was full after these two items, and took my enchiladas home, and because I reheated them (3 in total) the next day, I don't feel I can fairly review them. I must admit, the chips and salsa didn't impress me - the salsa was bland, and the chips had an odd - I want to say metallic-esque flavor to them.   The customer service, however, was perfection. Attentive,  friendly, and personable.   I need to return to do a fair assessment of an entrée, but from my first experience, and especially with a half off yelp deal, this place did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I was craving a burrito and decided to come over to Dos since its right down the street from where I work. I'll be honest and say I wasn't expecting much since it seems like Scottsdale has one too many mediocre Mexican places- but I was wrong! I walked in and was immediately seated in the bar area. There were only a few other people in there and the bartender quickly came over with water and chips and salsa. The chips were fresh and delicious, as was the salsa. It could've been spicier, but the flavor was so good I didn't mind. I ordered the green chile burrito which is served enchilada style, and had the sweet potato-stuffed chile and black beans and rice as my side dishes. The food came out quickly and was piping hot. The burrito was delicious! Very flavorful and the portion was huge. The sweet potato-stuffed chile was so good! It had an unexpected flavor and I will def order again. The black beans and rice were not different than normal but were very good also. All in all my food and service were awesome and I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Dos Juevos is still wearing the hand-me-down clothing of former tenant Julio G's.  The sign has changed and that's about it.  The Good: To my surprise though, decent food at very good prices (had the beef burrito w/cheese.. take out).  Drink prices are affordable considering it's Old town Scottsdale.. be advised you'll need to drink a lot to endure the atmosphere so it's probably a wash.  Bathroom was clean so points for that, BUT... out of paper towels.  The Bad: Slow service with a bartender that has no interest in the business, bored and inattentive wait staff.  No propane for outside patio heaters.    The Ugly: Something fresh is needed for decor.  Bad mojo leftover from amateur that last decorated the place. Cheap black and white tiles at a Mexican restaurant? Looks more like 50's style diner.   Recommendations:  Hire new staff or try to train existing on good service procedures.  Perform a total remodel or tear-down/re-build.    If the owner is a cheapo tightwad type, at the very least, tear down all the wall tiles and throw up some drywall (yes, paint it also).  Paint the outside also and remove all traces of the Julio G's failure.  For locals, suggest take out for now...  well, if you can find someone willing to serve you.   For tourists, run away as fast as you can.. there are dozens of better choices in the immediate area.  Wrap up: Great potential for a profitable restaurant. Missing fundamentals though. It really takes some juevos to run a place like this. This is not typical of Old town Scottsdale restaurants."}
{"text":"I tried this place for lunch yesterday. clean, nice atmosphere, but totally empty save for one old guy at the bar.  service was very nice, food was atrocious.  i love mexican food.  i grew up in phoenix and have had my share of the good, bad, and ugly.  this stuff was inexcusable. Enchilada was flavorless and drier than a popcorn fart.  Beans and rice were awful.  rice was sticky and chewy. beans had a vomity tasting crumbled white cheese topping.  i was starving, but after only a few bites of each item, i gave up.  this was mexican food blasphemy.  sorry guys, the food just needs a big overhaul."}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day and wasn't all that impressed.  FIrst off the parking is very strange you have to park off to the side and walk past an empty boarded up building to get to the front door.  The decor is more rock diner than mexican restaurant, but nice enough.  On a weekday at 12:00 they were completely empty and it's a huge restaurant so that's a little bit of a concern right off the bat.  I had the cheese enchiladas which were ok, not anything special and kinda plain.  The Corn pudding for a side was something you never see and was the best thing on my plate.  The Anaheim Chili stuffed with sweet potato would be better if they removed the skin. It was pretty inedible the way it was served and very messy to scrape the pepper and potato off the skin to eat it.  I will give them props for trying something different, but poor execution at any rate.  The high point was our great server. She was very friendly and really nice. So I think going here for chips and beer on the patio would be cool."}
{"text":"Closed by 11 on a Saturday night?  NOT a good sign... headed over here on a Saturday night with my wife for drinks and karaoke, etc, and it was dark and locked up.  Not good..."}
{"text":"This was our second try. The first resulted in a token gift card to inspire us to return and try again. The service was excellent this time. Despite her broken foot our waitress returned several times before and during our meal to check on us.  The refried beans are great. The pork torta was delicious though cool compared to everything else on the plate. Sweetpotato stuffed pepper is a great idea but the sauces on top were a distraction from the yummy potato-pepper combo. The open faced tamale was bland and a waste of calories. My mom ordered teh enchalada plate. She expected the same dish she ordered a few months ago- a nice cheesy plate of enchaladas with red sauce. She instead recieved a little skillet with a layer of green sauce on the bottom, 3 cheese enchaladas ontop of that, then a bit more cheese melted on top. so much of the corn tortillas were dry. My daughter ordered a cheese crisp of the kid menu. I thougth it was delicious but she did not care for the addition of mexican cheese to the traditional cojack. The cucumber margarita was excellent again. That may be what brings us back for a third try. I recommend if you go here to ask specifically about anything on the menu that is not clarified. the menu is unclear and sometimes misleading in it's description of certain dishes. And try the cucumber margarita. It's delicious."}
{"text":"This place has a very interesting decor/vibe & wasn't at all busy after church on Sunday. BUT they have a margarita for $0.01 check in special and the food was really pretty good!!! I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Went here today for the Puppy Patio Party benefit for Lucky Dog Rescue.  Tom was a great server.  With everyone moving tables and all the dogs, it was a bit hectic, but he did a really good job of keeping track of everything.  When my siblings arrived, we went inside and ate.  Had another good server and I ordered the green chile beef with the green chile rice and the sweet potato stuffed anaheim pepper.  It was all really good.  The spice of the anaheim pepper melded with the sweetness of the sweet potato really well.  My siblings got fajitas and a burger. Everyone spoke highly of their meals.  We were a little hesitant based on some of the reviews on here, but are really glad we went.  Their salsas were really good, especially the hot one."}
{"text":"Awful.  Just awful.  Flavorless americanized slop.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"If you are that bad and know it, why even try?  It is just a lifeless husk of what Julio G's used to be.   Basically mexican hospital food."}
{"text":"I loved the food!  The chips and salsa was amazing and fresh, I couldn't stop eating them.  Got the house margaritas, very good.  Got the fish taco appetizer, that was so delicious, I had to fight my sister for the third taco!  I got the pork torta and I absolutely loved it, even the rice and black beans were good.   The drink specials are really good and the service was great, I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I can't even review this place based on the food.  There was one couple seated in the bar area.  My stepdad and I waited for someone to come and seat us.  The restaurant felt like we were characters in The Stand.  The restaurant was empty and felt creepy.  I asked to leave and we went to a restaurant that had a pulse.  I do not see this place being in business much longer."}
{"text":"SO unimpressed.  They didn't even redecorate after Julio G's left.  There was no one at the front when we came in and the bartender didn't even look up.  Had to wait to be seated.    There were only a few people in the restaurant and now I know why.  The chips were oily and cold.  The salsa was bland.    I ordered the chicken tacos and the meat tasted weird and it had not been salted before cooking.  Very bland and grease came off the taco when I picked it up (and it was in a soft corn tortilla, not fried).  The refried beans were gluey and had NO FLAVOR.  The spanish rice was ok.  The grilled cheese my daughter go was ridiculous.  Velvetta between 2 pieces of Texas toast.  And served with cold fries.  No refills on my drink without having to ask, but my husbands' glass was constantly kept full.  In short, high price, low payout.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Although I was never a \"fan\" of Julio's, I was somewhat of a regular based on location.  So I was pleased to see another Mexican restaurant go into that spot,  hopefully one that could provide a chips & salsa fix on short notice.  I did think it was a little odd that the ladies that own New York Bagels 'N Bialys would venture into this territory, but what do I know about the restaurant biz?    My husband and I had dinner on only their second night open.  I was surprised that very little had changed inside.  There are still references to the original occupants, in fact.  As this was only night two, I won't factor in some expected service issues.  The boys on chip duty were there to make sure you never sat with an empty basket during the wait, however.  About those chips and salsa.  First basket of chips was cold, second was warm.  Didn't really matter.  There was nothing special about them or the salsa.  The salsa was good, but too sweet for me, and it could use a little more heat.  Overall, average.  The menu was interesting and shows a lot of promise.  For one thing, forget only standard beans and rice for sides.  Options include both black beans and refried beans, an Anaheim chile stuffed with sweet potato, corn pudding, green chile rice, and an open-faced tamale with wild rice.  The refried beans had good flavor, but I wasn't a fan of the texture.  I like whole beans and I like mashed beans, but these were more like a combination.  My husband liked them though.  The black beans were disappointingly bland for both of us.  The stuffed chile was good, but the sweet potatoes were...well, sweet, very sweet.  I really liked this dish, but would have liked to see more done with the potatoes.  A little more spice, a little smokiness to balance out the sweet.  The open-faced tamale was basically masa topped with a creamy wild rice.  I loved this dish with the exception of the masa which was way too hard.  I'm not a tamale-making expert, so not sure if this was a result of the preparation or over-cooking, but the end result was completely the opposite of what it should be.  I almost needed a knife to cut through it.  Would love to see a little more work on that.  As for entrees, we went with pretty basic stuff...carnitas burrito and green chile burrito.  First, the tortillas were a disaster.  I didn't expect the best, but these ladies should know the importance of the carb.  I'm the one who gets tired of the filling, pulls it all out, and eats the tortilla.  I tried that, but it had the consistency of cardboard.  Please, please, please find another supplier.  Both burritos had shredded meat, which I thought a little strange, especially with the carnitas.  The carnitas wasn't bad, but it was dry, and barely warm, not even warm enough to melt the  cheese inside.  The green chile was also borderline cold which I didn't get considering it's supposedly simmered for hours.  I liked this better than the carnitas, but it, too, was missing something.  I actually prefer mild dishes, but even I thought they could turn up the heat a notch.  Overall, I think there's a lot of potential here with a little work on the dishes.  Certainly an A-OK experience just out the gate.  I might also suggest they consider a cocktail menu, if they haven't already.  I was hoping for a margarita with agave nectar & lime juice, but couldn't get any useful info from the server beyond they have a \"house\" margarita and a cucumber margarita. But again, this was only night two, so I'll return in a few weeks and see how they're coming along.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"it is christmas eve and we are that couple....no kids, no family in town, don't eat meat, so instead of cooking, we took advantage of a coupon for Dos Juevos and i was very impressed.   the placed seemed empty, but slowly, more and more people came in. i guess we aren't the only non-family in town who don't want to cook on christmas eve. there was only 1 server for the front of the restaurant, and he was in quite possibly the best mood i've ever seen a server be...on christmas eve. when asked, he said it was so slow at 6pm, they let 2 cooks and 2 servers go home, only to be bombarded with a ton more customers within 30 minutes. so he was overworked, but his attitude and demeanor were impeccable.   now for the food: i ordered the cheese enchiladas with a side of creamy green chile rice and corn pudding. i thought the rice was very tasty...rich. the puddin was like a flan with corn. it was pretty good. i liked my enchiladas in the corn tortillas. my wife had the shrimp scampi and it was rich and buttery, and the anaheim stuffed with sweet potato was damn hot! all in all, a very good meal.   they must've heard the chip criticism because the chips were warm, thin, and very crispy. the salsa wasn't hot, but it was very good. i had a margarita (for only 3 bucks!) to complete the coupon sale. a very nice dining experience. i was extremely impressed!"}
{"text":"Dos Juevos gets dos thumbs down from me. Expensive with small, poor quality portions & you don't even want to know what I found en el bano. I really wanted it to be good."}
{"text":"Came here recently for lunch.  Self sat in the bar area to watch the games.  After we sat down we waited for about 10 minutes before someone came over and gave us some chips and salsa.  Then it took about 15 minutes to find out who our server was.  It so happened that our server was also the bartender.  We found that out when we ordered a bloody mary which by way was very good.  Sadly though after the bloody mary was brought over, the bartender/our server disappeared for a bit so we sat around another 10 minutes before I got up to the bar and asked if our server was going to take our order.  Well, our server came to our table a minute or two after that.  We ordered the 3 cheese enchiladas w/2 sides.  My friend ordered the street tacos.  Well, again, we sat there waiting for our food for about 20 to 25 more minutes.  Finally I got tired of waiting and I went to the bar again and asked if someone could check on our food.  The restaurant wasn't even busy which was the sad part.  So, our waiter came back to our table to tell us that it would be another 5 minutes because there might have been a mix up in the kitchen.  The food finally came and first, it was cold and bland.  The tortillas tasted like they just rolled them with the cheese and just added the sauce over and brought them to me.  The rice and beans were in these tiny saucer-like plates and rice was mushy for spanish rice, refried beans were ok.  All in all, the meal had no flavor and was cold and was served super late.  I hate to think how this restaurant really operates when the restaurant is BUSY.  The other part that was sad was seeing all the staff members walking around because they didn't have much to do but we still got our food late.  At first I thought it was just us but then I looked around and there was a couple that had their order screwed up and they sent their food back so either something was going or they just shouldn't be open for business.  One funny thing was they have a huge sign inside the restaurant that reads, \"Only Authentic Mexican Food Restaurant\"  There was nothing AUTHENTIC about the service, let alone the food.  Either way, we won't be going back to this place."}
{"text":"As a big fan of Julio G's, I was hoping this place would be just as amazing. Unfortunately, I was completely disappointed.   My friends and I decided to check this place out for dinner. On a Saturday night, this place was completely dead. That should have been my first clue to get out of there. We went in and the decor was the exact same as Julio's, which I thought was odd. Somehow, service took forever, even though it was really slow. I literally had to walk up to the bar to get a refill on my drink because nobody bothered to come by and check on us while we waited over 30 minutes for our food.  I ordered the chicken tacos, which were completely disgusting. I sent them back (I never send food back) but I literally could not  stomach the food. I re-ordered chicken tacos with basic chicken, lettuce, tomatoes and sour cream. They were better than what I had orginally ordered but tasted similar to what I could make at home. One of my friends ordered the enchiladas with enchilada sauce and I literally wanted to throw up after tasting them. Our waiter and the manager were both extremely apologetic but I knew I would never be eating here again.  If you're looking for a good meal or authenic mexican, this place is definitely not it."}
{"text":"i had the beef burrito which was good, and two margaritas.  The food was three stars good and came fast in spite of this being Cinco de Mayo.  Margaritas were not good.  the first was using whatever tequila they had in the well, the second i tried to upgrade by asking for patron. mistake. people, do not use sweet and sour mix for margaritas!  it ruins good tequila.  just two things to remember: lime juice and simple syrup, that is the basis for outstanding drinks!  the second drink tasted like it had about 1/2 ounce of patron.  food good, price good (got out for less than $ 20 including tip)  drinks ?.. if important, go somewhere else.  service was above average and considering every other place was packed, it was unexpectedly good.  cheers mike"}
{"text":"We've only eaten breakfast here, and it's always been good. It's not the most authentic Mexican food around, but it's tasty anyway. They have American and Mexican food for breakfast, the make your own omelets are good. If you want something that isn't listed on the ingredient list, like shrimp, ask,and if they have it they will do it. The omelets are nicely browned around the edges and soft and creamy inside. I like the potato pancakes that come with the omelets. The staff is very friendly and professional, we're always greeted and seated promptly, the coffee and chips and salsa are brought right away, and the coffee is always refilled. They are very accomodating about substitutions, they allow me to substitute spinach and mushrooms for the beef in the eggs benedict.  All around, it's a great place for a weekend breakfast."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on the advice of my dad. I am pretty sure he found a place that had breakfast that had booze, so that was the deciding factor. It definitely wasn't the food, which was not very good. Chorizo and egg burrito - nothing could save it, not salsa, not sour cream, not ketchup!  Would not go back here - maybe the mexi food is better, but I doubt it - its called Two Eggs Cantina and has bad breakfast, no thank you ."}
{"text":"Not all that great - food or service.  I really wanted to like this place.  May try the breakfast menu though... always looking for a good place for breakfast.  The server seemed on something not so good and knew very little about the menu - NOT a good idea for a Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Decor and chips were unchanged from Julio G's. Unfortunately the food has changed and for the worse. The corn pudding is nothing more than an egg omelet. The open faced tamale is just a regular tamale and the beef green chili nothing more than a can of roast beef with some green chili's added. Don't know why we ordered dessert but the deep fried ice cream was also pretty pathetic."}
{"text":"My husband works nights and doesn't get home until around 10:30, so I was thrilled to see on their website that they were open everyday until 2:00 a.m.  We arrived Saturday night (April 14, 2012) just before 10:30 to the restaurant to see ABSOLUTELY NO ONE IN SITE except a hostess/waiter in the bar, who informed us the dining room closes at 10:00, but that they serve appetizers in the bar. There wasn't a customer in sight, except us. We sat down in the bar, as the server watched the t.v., and we looked at the appetizer selection, and considered settling for that.  Then I thought:  \"Why should we?\"  We had our hearts set on the fajitas and enchiladas (from checking out the menu on their website).  As we went to leave, the server did bring chips and salsa, but we had such a \"bad taste in our mouth\", we chose to leave.  As we were leaving, another potential customer entered to find out the same disappointment and he left immediately behind us.  No wonder the place was empty.  People don't appreciate let-downs.  This place must CHANGE their WEBSITE HOURS to reveal their TRUE HOURS, i.e. for dining room; bar, etc..  All bars are open until 2:00 a.m....BIG deal!!!!  Julio G's, we miss you!!!!!"}
{"text":"Dos Juevos has some big shoes to fill (post Julio G's). Here is my advice (I want them to make it). The menu is a total mess and the food is way too complicated. This is NOT a fancy restaurant. The atmosphere here begs for some old school combo plates with taco, tostada and enchilada combos served on inferno-hot plates. Keep it simple! Salsa is VERY important - you have to offer the hot thin stuff. Chips were soggy and undercooked. Also, this place is cavernous, rather than sacrifice on service (ours was embarrassingly slow) confine guests to the very front for now... Simplifying the menu will help with prep time too. Old Town needs more breakfast spots, so I would also encourage a breakfast-only southwest themed menu before noon. Throw in a food eating contest for good measure and you'll be on your way to fame. Good luck guys!!!"}
{"text":"I feel really terrible to say, that we were very disappointed in this restaurant. The decor was very cute, and looks pretty much identical to Julio G's, the previous establishment. It was also very clean, and the server, hostess, etc. were very nice.   I was really impressed when I first looked at the menu because it looked really interesting and creative, offering some interesting choices for side dishes. The chips and salsa were very good. The chips were fresh and crispy, and the salsa was fresh and tasty. Our waiter offered us queso dip, before we looked at the menu. It was very good. I asked if there was meat in it, and he said no. However, after looking at the menu, it had chorizo in it. I rarely eat pork and never beef, so It was weird that I figured this out after eating quite a bit of it. I will say it was good though.   Then our entrees came. I had to search for my fish in my tacos. The fish was little tiny bits of end pieces of fish, and it was very greasy, and completely flavorless. Even the corn tortilla seemed flavorless. The chicken taco was ok. Way better than the fish, but nothing to write home about either. Bland. The black beans, were not hot, and they were very pasty and flavorless. I was excited to get the green chile rice for my side because I love green chile and used to live in New Mexico. However, I think it was Lipton or Rice-a-Roni rice from a bag. Very bland, flavorless, and tasted like it came from a package. Nothing special at all. Again very bland.  Other people at our table had enchiladas, which were also very bland and in an ancho chile enchilada sauce, that just tasted chalky and had no flavor.  They felt the same about the sides too. One person had the refried beans and said they had no flavor and another had spanish rice that had no flavor and tasted like it came from a package too.    If you are just into having chips, salsa, and a beer in a cool setting at happy hour, then this is your place, but don't order any food. Or if you are into really bland and boring Mexican food, and are not very adventurous, this is your place.  As a resident of South Scottsdale, I was really disappointed that this place was not better. It is convenient for me and my husband, and I was really hoping this would be a cool new place for us.  However, I don't think I will be back.  If you want a good taco, Cien Agave is your place. It is only a mile down the street."}
{"text":"Despite their weak signage and website, we persevered and stopped in for lunch. We were rewarded with an excellent meal and great service. Our waiter was outstanding, and guided three of us to the fish tacos - which were excellent. All the sides we tried were good including anaheim pepper stuffed with sweet potato and the fries. Great location, food and service - recommended.  Yes the parking lot location is a bit odd but give it a try."}
{"text":"Horrendous food. I do not like to leave negative reviews but this restaurant takes the cake. Ordered a chimichanga style burro, and it was soggy.  The tacos, tortillas were cold and broke in half when we tried to pick them up. The beans are obvious can and rice had no flavor whatsoever.  The waitress was awesome though and I feel bad for her."}
{"text":"We should have known from the parking lot but decided to keep going in. We shouldve known by the sign hanging down in our faces as we walked in, but we kept going in. We shouldve known by the taste of the water (we think they got it out of the urinal) but we ordered an appetizer anyway. Heres the thing....coming from a longtime server/ bartender, these things can usually be overlooked in a new place. After tasting the water, we decided to not order a drink and taste our appetizer before going further....see...we started getting it after awhile....the cheese crisp was so overcooked that the cheese was hard and had burnt bubbles on it.I would NEVER have served that at my restaurant nor would my chef allowed that to go out. As everyone else stated, the chips were ok but salsa was horrible. I asked the server for something hotter and he said, \"Oh, I have something for you\" and then never brought it. We just asked for our check and left, careful not to hit our heads on the 5 foot sign hanging down in front of the front door."}
