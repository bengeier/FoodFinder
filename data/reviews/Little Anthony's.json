{"text":"The turkey meatballs are delicious!  Nice atmosphere and good service.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Wednesday night for a corporate event. 

I started with a Classic Caesar Salad -which was generous in dressing and portions. 

For the main I had the New York Strip Loin Steam, medium rare. I was impressed with the consistency in how it was cooked. My steak also came with greens, mushrooms, and bite sized potatoes that were perfectly fried.

For dessert I had the Tiramisu which was absolutely rich and soft - full of coffee flavour! It was a tad sweet for my personal preference, though other guests enjoyed it. 

Service was excellent; they made sure we had everything. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and would definitely recommend Little Anthony's."}
{"text":"After 3 visits (twice for dinner and once for lunch)  I highly recommend this place if you feel like a nice meal out - price is on par with very upscale restaurants in the area , so not an everyday spot but great when you feel like a nice meal out with exceptional service.  The food is well prepared and presented well - I wouldn't say there is a must  try dish - as we were all happy with our 3 courses. 

What sets it apart is that is quieter and not as hurried as the other restaurants in the downtown core."}
{"text":"While always a fan of Little Anthony's, it was definitely time to update the decor and the menu.
Went with a group of friends for a pre-concert dinner and were impressed with the new look and menu.
I had the Buffalo Mozzarela & tomato salad and the Lamb Osso Buco. Both outstanding and paired nicely with the Barolo chosen for the table.My girlfriend had the Turkey meatballs and they were awesome!
Made for a great start of the night and I will definitely go back soon!"}
{"text":"Might just be the best Italian restaurant in town. Great location and quite romantic for a date night dinner. Had the best Ossobuco I've ever tasted! Paired with an awesome glass of wine and un-parallel service, my dining experience was nothing short of spectacular. Will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Went on a Saturday night and sat at the bar. Amazing service. Had foccaccia bread, the bruschetta is unbelievable, wine, the carbonara is awesome and the bolagnese is incredible, finished it off with an espresso. My pasta was a little undercooked and they immediately made me a new one and apologized several times which was great. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Exactly what I was looking for. A relatively quiet restaurant with good food that is somewhere in the downtown core. This is one of the few places I'd happily go to knowing that I can actually hear and enjoy my conversation and my food. Not a super easy find given the propensity of DT Core lunchers to crowd all the decent places in the area. 

The service was excellent, attentive but not at all pretentious. The setting was pleasant and we enjoyed the natural light coming through the window, a good break for office florescent lighting! We both had the same lunch special, a blackened salmon served with pasta. I don't remember the sauce name, but it was perfect for a cold afternoon.

Looking forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"The ambiance was very nice. The salad definitely need more flavor, especially since it suggested there would be a lemon dressing on it. The spaghetti was decent but i felt the sauce could have been a lot thicker. The chicken and red potatoes were excellent and so was the chocolate cake. Overall very pleasant but a little room for improvement."}
{"text":"Normally I am reluctant going into Italian restaurants since it is often the case that it seems they take the pasta from the closest supermarket and deliver a meal resembling the horrors of tourist food around Italy.... however this was definitely not the case. The Turkey meatballs were a great starter and the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese was superbe (no supermarket tomato sauce!!)! While I was already full after the meal, having had such a lovely time sipping the great wine reccomendation, I decided to add the cherry on top with a very fresh sorbet. 
Great way to start an evening!"}
{"text":"Wonderful meal after a long day! The waiter was fantastic, letting me merge two meals. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I used to work near this place and always wanted to try it and finally got around to it.

Atmosphere and very mellow and dim, good for a date.
Food was OK...only OK.  Portions were on the small side.

Service was HORRIBLE.  I don't want to say it, and I really hate to say it, but I think maybe we got a racist server....or maybe an agist one since I look on the young side so maybe she thought I don't tip well???

Our server took forever to bring us water and she never directly served us either.  It was always the bus boy who did all the work.  I understand that in some restaurants, but not when I see the server doing all the work for all her other tables, who were Caucasian and older.

Table next to us, she brought the bread and balsamic without being asked.  The bus boy gave us the bread and we had to ask for balsamic.

When our dishes came, bus boy again.  She also served all other tables pepper and cheese herself within minutes of bringing them their food.  We waited a good 10 minutes as she seemed to be no where around.

Even if we didn't want that stuff, a good server should come and ask, \"is everything OK with your food?\" within the first 5 minutes.

She also never refilled our water herself, we always had to ask.

At a \"nice\" restaurant I expect better service than this."}
{"text":"This was our first time dining in this restaurant and our overall experience is great.

It was for our Valentine's Day dinner and we were actually running late but the restaurant staff was very polite and gave us a call while we were on the way.

It was a very neat and cozy place.  Decor is nice and layout of the restaurant is simple and efficient.   For bigger tables, there are two separate rooms at each end of the room.

Service --  due to short of staff on that day as they usually close on Sunday, it took a little while before the server first came to us.  Still we consider the service acceptable.  The speed of having the appetizers was actually quite fast.

Food -- we ordered bruschetta, Giardino (which is actually mixed salad) as appetizers.  Our main dishes were Linguine alla Vongole and see bass Acqua pazza.  All taste really good because the ingredients are really fresh and of good quality.  Also the favors of various ingredients mix really well.

We would really come back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing, the food is very good, but the service is not the best, The server are a little rude, but the food is the best Italian food in the city."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and delicious food. Nice assortment of cheeses and nice selection of wine. The Alberta beef and turkey meatballs are a must!"}
{"text":"3.5/5! I recommend this place for a large group for summerlicious. We had no problem getting a reservation for a table of 10 on a Friday night. We were pleasantly surprised by the food and service. The starters were the only mediocre part of the meal. The kale salad & mussels are okay (nothing to write home about). However, the main courses were very good. I recommend the Pollo Ripieno but if you aren't in the mood for chicken, the Tilapia Con Carciofi is also good. The best part of the meal is definitely the dessert. The gelato and Classic Tiramisu rank up there with the best in Toronto. Overall, for $35 dinner you won't be disappointed (especially if you enjoy your desserts)."}
{"text":"I was really impressed.  Service was great and the food was spot on.  Had the flat iron steak and gnocchi and it was very tender and gnocchi were spot on.  Would definitely recommend if in the area for a show/theatre etc."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place...an incredible revitalization for a classic Toronto restaurant.  

The Tagliatellealla Bolognese is amazing...Roasted Pumpkin Risotto is incredible. For the main course my favorites are the sea scallops, striploin and the Osso Buco.  Brussel sprouts are the best in Toronto.   

Great vibe and a very fun place to eat dinner or just hang out and grab a drink."}
{"text":"Remodelled, Simplified and Changed Completely in March 2012

If you are expecting the Little Anthony's from three months ago, I am sad to say, it's gone.  The menu is merely a faint echo of what it used to be, with a one page sparse offering now.  Prices are up, portions are down. (but, you do get a comically large china plate to eat it off of though - perhaps this is to make you feel like you received a full sized meal) Gone are the linen table cloths and sharply dressed professional wait staff, in favour of younger informally dressed servers.   The atmosphere is no longer inviting and comfortable - light green stained wood tables and bright orange chairs now densely populate a very open concept design. Now, it's a \"hurry up, eat and get out\" atmosphere.  Don't try and have a conversation with anyone in this place now unless you are right next to them.  Seriously.  If you can get over the new lunchroom style atmosphere, the food is ok, but not great.  There is better food, service and atmosphere for less, very closeby.  To add insult to injury, have you ever heard of a real italian restaurant that doesn't serve a risotto of any sort?  That's right, they axed that to, along with almost all of their formerly respectable wine list.  With the new atmosphere, much less attentive service, and small menu, I think they're really going to miss the theatre/opera/ballet crowd they have relied on for so long.  It certainly has me looking for alternatives now...."}
{"text":"Great wine, very professional waiters, and very well prepared authentic Italian food. AMAZING dessert."}
{"text":"I live in Chicago, the capitol of restaurants.  I've been to LA's twice for business dinners. I can't imagine anyone giving this place less than 4 stars, excellent service and absolutely delicious food. The first was with a party of 8 and this last time a party of 4, everyone has left the restaurant raving! The dates wrapped in bacon, minestrone soup, veal, filet are all amazing."}
{"text":"The food was good but not mind blowing and the atmosphere and service were excellent. Nice place for a romantic meal. Found the booths a little uncomfortable but I'm a big guy."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Food was ok.
Table service was ok.
Seems that kitchen still getting organized as meal took forever to emerge."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here...I had the steak.  I ordered it medium. It came well done.  The manager came over and was in our face with a pushy attitude.  He offered a new steak and I said no I will never throw out food. I asked if he could comp it or offer a discount and he said no. He than offered us dessert which we don't eat or preseco which is disgusting!  He should have offered a discount or comped it because it would have cost more to make another steak and throw one out. The Caesar salad...all I tasted was pepper.  Not good at all. We also ordered olives which we never got. Our server was a little slow upstairs...Will not go back. To the horrible manager....I recouped half the cost of my meal by saving on tip. Well done."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed with our experience. 

We made a reservation for 7PM and arrived at 6:50. We were not greeted and the hostess only came around occasionally.  At 7, we finally managed to flag her down and tell her we had a reservation. Waited another 20 minutes before we were seated. I found it strange to wait that long since there were more than six tables that were free but many people with reservations were still waiting for their tables. 

Waited another 10 minutes before someone came to give us water. We ordered the turkey meatballs, the wild mushroom risotto, and strozzapreti genovese. 

The turkey meatballs were good. They was three and they were in a tomato-based sauce. They were quite juicy considering that they're turkey. 

The wild mushroom risotto was very strange like a dessert. It was sweet like sugar and the rice was mushy. 

I've never sent anything back to the kitchen before, but I couldn't eat the strozzapreti genovese. The whole dish tasted bitter and burnt.  The shrimp was charred so maybe they mixed it in with the sauce and hence everything turned bitter. They replaced the dish and the new one tasted overly salty but not  burnt. We were charged full price for the dish.

In short, bad service and bad food. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and attentive, but not overbearing.  Atmosphere was quiet and cozy with soft jazz playing in the background.  Definitely a good place if you want to carry conversation with friends or want a nice evening with your significant other.  Good selection of wines available at various prices.  

Food was well presented and everything tasted amazingly fresh. All food orders came out at reasonable times with the right amount of time lapses in between courses.  Plus they decorated a slice of tiramisu for my friend's birthday. 

We shared the turkey meatballs ($14)  which was absolutely tender and had a nice blend of sauce,  cheese and basil, the bacon wrapped dates ($8.50) were cooked nicely;  cheese stuffing wasn't overwhelming and bacon added a nice crisp taste. 

The mixed salad  ($8.75) was lightly dressed with shallot vinaigrette and could have used more greens on the plate since it wasn't much of a serving portion. 
 
Main pasta portion was a little on the smaller side for $19.75, but was delicious.  I ordered the linguine alla vongole which was cooked with a bit too much olive oil for my liking. Pasta was made with fresh littleneck clams, cherry tomatoes,  smoked bacon, chili and lemon. 

Overall a great dining experience, but a little on the pricey side for what you're getting."}
{"text":"Great food and service every time I eat here. Pasta is very good as it is cooked properly and has great seasoning. Highly recommend dinner at LA's!"}
{"text":"SINGLE DINERS BEWARE

I made a confirmed reservation for 7:45pm and arrived at 7:44 to be told by hostess that no tables were available and I should wait 15 min at the bar( in other words SPEND MONEY .
I pointed out a two top table by the window and she said oh that's reserved to which I replied I have a reservation at this time and there is NO ONE ELSE HERE WAITING
She said she'd have to go and check but after waiting a few minutes for her return I decided I didn't want to give my money to a place that handled customers so rudely so went around the corner to another restaurant where I was warmly welcomed even with no reservation 

As I was being seated the other hostess phoned me to say that she now had a table for me since the Other table had canceled to which I replied that it had been MY TABLE ALL ALONG and I would never return
They would rather give a two top to TWO PEOPLE than honor a confirmed reservation 

My suggestion is never book there as there are Plenty of other places within a half block who will welcome you and honor your reservation"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, excellent service, tHe beet ravolini and lamb Milanese was incredible!!!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Great Italian food, excellent wine recommendation and they sure know how to make a Negroni. Try the turkey meatballs!"}
{"text":"Dropped by this place for a work lunch.  Had the NZ lamb chops that were flown in same day. Barely seasoned with some chimmichuri on top really let the meat speak for itself. Colleagues had pasta dishes that smelled amazing. Service was prompt and very helpful. Will definitely be booking for lunches hear!"}
{"text":"Overall, a great restaurant!

I went with a large group for a birthday and sat at the private table - great ambience and decor.

This restaurant excels at service. The moment we walked in, the host was friendly and inviting. The waiter was also great and made sure our wine glasses and water were topped up on a regular basis. During dinner service, we were all waiting on my partner's dish to come (7 out of 8 of us had our food) and it was maybe 3-4 mins later that her dish arrived. Because of this slight delay, they waived her entire Winterlicious bill. That's service!

On to the food. I had the caesar salad to start and quite honestly it was very forgettable. I felt it was lacking dressing and had very little flavour. Someone else had the bruschetta and it looked incredible; I'll get that next time.

For my main, I had the Linguine alla Vongole and it was delicious. Very nicely cooked pasta and great flavour. I just wish there had been a bit more of it; found the portion to be a bit small as a main.

For dessert, had the chocolate gelato - no complaints. My partner had the tiramisu as part of her Winterlicious menu and that was also really good - nice and light, with great coffee flavour.

Great meal overall, and I will definitely return to LA!"}
{"text":"I was quite disappointed I didn't hold out and just go to Little Italy instead of going here.

Unfortunately we were tired and didn't feel like getting a cab to go to Little Italy and our hotel said this place was good and close to the hotel. 

I got the Butternut Squash Ravioli's and was quite excited, one of my favorite dishes.  However the dish was exceptionally underwhelming.  They didn't season the butternut squash with any cinnamon or nutmeg or sage or frankly anything.  It was very bland and quite disappointing.  It was also the tiniest order of food I've been given outside of Italy (as their portions are correct as to what we SHOULD be eating).  There was only 5 or 6 raviolis for $17, yikes, way too much for that quantity. 

The pasta was actually very nice, not too thick, as I hate when the pasta is overwhelming and you don't notice there is anything inside the ravioli.

My husband, was not a huge fan of his Pasta Bolognese either, frankly couldn't have been much more disappointed with the food, need to work on their flavors here.

There are SO many good places to have Italian in Toronto, so don't waste your time w/this place."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try LA's and more so after the renovation and Yelp's Elite Party a month ago. So, when my mom wanted a suggestion for downtown core-ish eating, I happily offered LA's for a Friday 7pm reservation.

Upon entering, I could see the bar area was already quite busy and lots of empty tables of 4 (by the window), but the tables for two were filling up fast. The seating was awkward as the guests who sit on the chairs (not on the booth like seats) are back to back against the seat of the table for four. This means that whenever someone wants to pass through (guests and waiters) you will always get a tug and a kick on your chair. Not a fan.

The menu is small so I opted for the ceviche and Bolognese pasta. My mom ordered the meat special (beef flank) and we also decided to share the Burrata with honey (oh so yummy). Two glasses of the Valpolicella later and my mom and I were sufficiently full. I have to say the food was good, but nothing outstanding. The beef flank special my mom got was literally just that...5-6 pieces of flank steak on a white plate with no sides (I mean come on! Not even a sprig of Parsley?!?!) My mom had a taste of my pasta and she said it was dry, but I was hungry and I devoured everything.

 I can see myself coming here for the bar and some nibbles but I was expecting more from LA with its dinner menu."}
{"text":"Came here for a company lunch where we were served a set three course lunch with some choices for the appetizer, main, and dessert. I chose the minestrone soup, mushroom risotto, and the seasonal panna cotta.

The minestrone soup was mediocre, to be honest. It didn't leave a lasting impression, but was definitely perfect given the chilly weather outside. I tried some of my friend's turkey meatballs, and it was quite good. Not too dry, though it could have benefitted from more sauce. It was also a generous portion, with three massive fist sized turkey balls.

I was originally very excited for the mushroom risotto, but ultimately found it quite disappointing. Mine was super creamy and buttery, which was nice; however, I found it too runny. My friend had ordered the same thing, but hers was much drier. In other words, the restaurant quality was inconsistent. I left it largely untouched...

I finished with the panna cotta. It had poached pears with candied pistachios on the side, and I enjoyed it very much. In fact, I ate them all from the outset. The panna cotta was slightly firm and tasted a bit too strongly of cream cheese for some reason, but was still decent. I also had a bite of my friend's tiramisu, and found it very light, spongey, but rich in espresso flavour. Was pretty good!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to splurge on this space. He vibe was uncomfortable. I even asked if they were open because no one acknowledged me for quite some time. The food is expensive, which I don't mind as long as it's good. My salad was bland and meatballs were not warm in the middle. Sad about this experience as a whole."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly service. Food was splendid and quick. Truly an Italian gem."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the very attentive staff and flavorful foods. Considering it was 8:00 PM on a Saturday night I don't know when I've been greeted by such a happy and friendly staff. They immediately made my first visit feel like I was an old friend returning. The food was good with the caveat that everyone has their own preferences when it comes to sauces, spices, etc. I found their food very much to my liking, rich and flavorful. The only improvement I would have is to add a bit more balsamic to the caprese salad. Will visit here again on my next trip to Toronto"}
{"text":"Looked like a nice enough place.  I went in and checked it out and made a reservation for a party of 6.  I also used their Internet WiFi.  FOR THAT PRIVILEGE, I am now getting spam (junk eMail messages) from a site called, \"Turnstyle\".  They right away said in eMail to me, \"Hi John, You're family.\"  Wow.  I don't know them, I certainly don't want to be in somebody's family I don't know, and don't call me John unless you're a friend or family member.  I cancelled my reservation for that night and went somewhere else.  I now today have another eMail from \"Turnstyle\".  I don't appreciate my phone being used as their marketing medium for the privilege of using briefly their WiFi."}
{"text":"The food is average - and I've tried five different items. It's a good spot if you're staying across the street at the Sheraton and need a quick solo dinner at the bar."}
{"text":"This was an impromptu visit as we were heading to the pan am games concert to see Machel Montano. They had a summerlicious menu but nothing really spoke to us. My girl ordered the chicken parm and I got the flank steak with gnocchi. They do give bread with olive oil which I always like. It was just regular white bread but still good. My steak was actually cooked perfectly to medium. The gnocchi it came with was not too heavy and was a great accompaniment. My friend said her meal was good but nothing to brag about. They don't have an extensive menu and it is a bit pricy. The ambiance is very contemporary romantic so would recommend for a nice date. However I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if you're in the area then I would give it a shot"}
{"text":"I've been Little Anthony's often for lunches.  It's a solid spot in the financial district that is a bit outside the \"busy zone\", so you can usually get a short notice reservation if necessary.  It's typically quiet and a looks very classy inside and thus is a great spot to take clients.  I don't doubt they get a lot of dinner business being so close to the four seasons.  The same owner also runs Volos across the street (formerly Mediterra), which I've also been to and am a fan of.

They recently revamped their menu several months ago and I believe hired a new head chef.  I noticed a good improvement in the taste of their food after this!  The pasta is excellent here.  My personal favourite is the carbonara.  They also offer gluten free pasta, which is great.  The caesar salad is also very good.

Service at Little Anthony's is great.  Whether you book online or over the phone, they'll send you an email confirming your reservation right into your calendar, and will call you the day before to remind you.  This works wonders for someone who forgets when they have a business lunch!  They also have a really nice bar area, which has potential to be a good spot for after-work drinks."}
{"text":"It was our last night in Toronto and we wanted Italian. Little Anthony's was about a block from our hotel, so we thought, why not? From the moment we stepped into Little Anthony's and were greeted by our Indian host, Rashid, we knew we'd stumbled upon a gem. He was awesome! 

We had a nice, cozy little booth across from some hilariously drunk four-top, one of whom was treated to a rousing rendition of Happy Birthday by one of the waiters, who must have a professional singing gig on the side. That guy had a set of pipes!

I ordered the gnocchi and my husband, the tortellini. Fortunately, there is the option to order the smaller size, which was great because we're not huge eaters and didn't want to lug leftovers to our next destination. We really loved our meal. It was truly scrumptious."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. The service was great! I had the cioppino and it was outstanding! Yelpers get a free turkey meatball dish when they check in. It was delicious too!"}
{"text":"While the service at the front was great, really, you could do better if you're looking for a decent meal. The food was pricy for what it was, and medicore at best. I had duck leg with rapini and a base of white bean. It sounds better than the execution. It also took a while for the food to get to our table and it wasn't that busy. We shared a large charcuterie plate, and while it was fine, it did seem pricy.

There were tvs showing sports games at the restaurant which seemed a at odds with the 'fancy' look of the rest of the decor.

I was really expecting much better."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times, and the food is always delicious and authentic Italian. Prices are reasonable (for downtown Toronto), and it has a somewhat upscale atmosphere. Don't pass up coffee and dessert!"}
{"text":"Went here for winterlicious, and not bad at all. Simple menu but food is prepared well. We did the  turkey meatballs followed by a salad of roasted carrots, blood oranges and arugula. Delicious. And the meatballs were so, so tasty, covered in fresh marinara, parmesan and the warm crunch of fresh bread crumbs. I had the Funghi crostini. Was good. Mushrooms were meaty in texture and flavour. For the main, we had the ziti arrabbiata and the brisket. Brisket was cooked tender, comforting and full of flavour. And the arrabbiata was unusually spicy, which really was a pleasant surprise. Overall, an enjoyable meal in an inviting, cozy atmosphere. And service was good - our waitress was a delight."}
{"text":"The food was good-not really anything special, especially for the price!  Service was horrible!  We sat at the bar, and the bartender all but ignored us.  He had two other bar customer, so it wasn't as if he was busy.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"A trifle spendy, but excellent value for money, and the definitive pre-opera restaurant.  Just southeast of the Four Seasons opera house, Little Anthony's is fancy enough to feel special but not intimidating.  The staff are benign and attentive, and yes, if it's an opera night the resident waiter/tenor will favour the room with a short aria from tonight's performance.  

But the food!  The food is really good.  I love the vinaigrette they use on their baby greens salad - so simple, but so tasty.  The salmon in a tarragon butter sauce is succulently moist, and my friend swears by the gorgonzola pasta.  The osso bucco is great, too!  The wine list is good, with enough by-the-glass options.  Desserts are just what they should be.

All that, and service is nippy enough to get you out the door in plenty of time for the opera without rushing you.  Maybe food isn't as high an art as music, but I've had more disappointments with the operas than with Little Anthony's."}
{"text":"What bothers me about a place like this is that they present themselves as a nicer place, but it's lack of attention to detail that's keeping it from actually being a nice place.  Small example: Their menu's are way too big for their tables. With so many things on the table to begin with, there was nowhere to really put your menu and not have it in the way and/or knocking things over.

Our waiter was slow and clueless.  Between 9 people he brings one bread basket (6 pieces of bread inside) and a tiny plate for olive oil and balsamic which didn't last long.  When we asked for more, you'd think a more proactive person would bring out a second plate for the table so people wouldn't be reaching across the table to dip their bread, but no, this guy just comes out with the bottle and pours a bit more on the plate like it was liquid gold and we weren't worthy.

My veal shank was tender but not flavourful, the osso bucco undercooked and harder than I would've liked. Which was disappointing because when I asked our waiter if he would recommend it, he scoffed at me saying \"well, I'm Italian and it's cooked to perfection\".  Credibility zero.

Same could be said for the risotto's around the table.  No one at the table was overly excited to be eating their entree.  Just really boring food cooked with a helping of meh. 

Rounding out my meal was a runny, snotty creme brule that looked awful, but tasted okay.

Overall very disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"We visited Little Anthony's for a birthday celebration.  This Italian restaurant is fairly quiet so it's great for engaging in conversation without a lot of background noise.  It has a modern decor and the service was really good.  We ordered the sea bass and the pappardelle.  The fish was perfectly baked and the capers didn't overpower the dish.  The pasta was well presented with tomatoes and capers.  It had just the right flavour of lemon and chili.  I would definitely recommend Little Anthony's for a special occasion."}
{"text":"We were visiting some friends at the Sheraton, and decided to get a bite to eat at Little Anthony's on Richmond. Needless to say this tired, old place (badly in need of a makeover) is a convenient Italian food restaurant for tourists only. Located next to the Hilton Hotel, and other tourist trap destinations it seeks to give a \"authentic Italian\" dining experience to Asian and American individuals whose tongues have been robbed of a few million tastebuds. Seriously speaking the Osso Buco Milanese had a strange, tastless gravy, and the meat was inconsistent when masticating. Tender one minute, then chewy the next. The \"hard\" al dente risotto was edible, but had off tasting sun dried tomatoes strewn about it. The tiger shrimps were grilled and tasty, but lacked imagination, presentation, and spice. The crème brûlée was God-awful from the first poke of the non-crackly crust to the eggy custard taste of the yellow thing in the middle. As well, the Dulce de Leche cheesecake was of the cheap sugary variety found at Red Lobster. We were remiss to try the Tiramisu after it was offered by our pleasant, life-time server named \"Bob\". Beware of Mediterra Restaurant & Lounge across the street, because it's owned by the same people. Just for kicks and giggles we poked our head in. We took a gander at the lobsters in the aquarium and right away could see they were old and decrepit. Neither place has our blessing."}
{"text":"It's never easy when you have to pick a restaurant that your parents will enjoy, and Italian always seems like a safe choice. But you can only take them to the same place so many times before you need to look somewhere else. 

I had passed Little Anthony's a number of times over the years and decided perhaps now was the time to try it out. The menu looked good, the prices weren't crazy, and it was close to my work so it seemed like the right option.

The food was really tasty. I had spaghetti carbonara and a split caesar salad with my wife to start. The salad was big enough to share and was a great. Nicely dressed (there's nothing worse than an underdressed caesar) and not *too* garlicy. The spaghetti carbonara was excellent too! Not too rich, with nice big chunks of bacon, which I can get behind 100%. They also provide really delicious bread before your meal, and there's nothing wrong with delicious bread!

They have a pretty good looking wine list, though as someone who doesn't really know *that* much about wine I can't say how extensive or quality it is. 

Their dessert options were excellent, though I personally passed on dessert. However, since it was my birthday they did bring me a free tiramisu, which was enjoyed by everyone at the table.

It was a Tuesday night, and the place wasn't crazy busy, which was great because it meant everyone at our table to converse and hear each other, which was a nice change.

The only thing that left a little to be desired was the service. When we arrived I needed to add one more person to our party, and the staff seemed a bit miffed by this. I probably should have called ahead, but it simply meant adding an extra chair and didn't seem like *that* big of a deal to warrant the mild attitude I received.

That being said, the food is what matters, and it was good enough that I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Good pre-theatre stop. I've tried the bacon wrapped dates (delicious), veal osso buco (rich) and linguine alla vongole (yum).  Everything was lovely. However, the menu is a bit boring. Service was outstanding and efficient. We chose from the regular menu but there's also a pre-theatre menu."}
{"text":"First time here and I was not disappointed at all. Came to Little Anthony's to meet up with a friend over lunch. The venue is very clean and classy but without the over extravagant feel. I like that. I walked up to the front desk and the maitre d' brought me to the reserved table. 

Let's talk about service. The service staff here are very polite, have great attitude and great smile. One observation I made is, the patrons are known to some of the staff here. So that's a definite plus regarding high rate of returning customers. 

Food wise, I ordered the carbonara and that was pretty good. However, it was leaning more on the salty end and the noodle wasn't as al dente as I wanted it. (that's where the 1 star was deducted from). I like this place's atmosphere plus it is very well lit. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The whole evening was superb. Great decor and ambiance, the service was top notch - attentive, and not over-zealous. The food surprised us all in value and taste. Pasta's are up there as best in city along with desset. Not one dud. Wine list standard. worth a visit !!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday and was pleasantly surprised to have a delicious meal, good service in a non-pretentious restaurant downtown. Be mindful though b/c of its location, weekday lunches would be more of a work crowd. We shared the turkey meatball plate which was free after a check-in (and you get a plate of 3 meatballs if you order an entree) and my friend had the lamb and I had the linguini with clams. My pasta was perfectly al dente, not too oily and full of clean clams. It was also spicy which was great. Overall a solid lunch experience."}
{"text":"Hosted a group of customers recently and everyone really enjoyed the meal and service."}
{"text":"Including today,  I have been here twice now.  Both times it was for a company lunch - the first time we ordered from their regular menu and the second time (today)  we had a set menu.  I have to say,  great location and comfortable ambiance. 
But why I am giving this place a three vs.  a four star is because their service is very,  very slow.  If it is a business lunch and you didn't have any meeting scheduled for the afternoon (and your boss doesn't care how long your business lunch takes....  Or if you are with your boss)  then by all means come here for a super,  super chill lunch.  The service you get is good - the servers are all very professional but it just takes too long to place your order and get your food,  even when it is a set menu.  
The food here is good Italian food. I really enjoyed my pasta here although the Tiramsu wasn't as good as I had hoped (it was just too creamy so when you put it in your mouth it just felt like you were just eating mascarpone). The turkey meatballs,  I thought was just average.  It was a bit dense for my taste,  I like my meatballs more on the fluffy side.  Overall today's business lunch took at least 2 hours and some people had to leave early and forego their meals because it was taking too long and they had other appointments to keep."}
{"text":"I love this spot, I wish I worked closer to this place because everyone would find me here eating lunch everyday. 

The venue is nice, staff are dressed up with long aprons, the way they set it up, you don't feel like your crammed in a can, you can breathe. 

Came here for lunch, we shared the salad and each got our own pasta dish. 

Lunch: 
Fall Caprese Salad ($15) Sweet and Sour Beets, Torn Bufala Mozzarella, Vincotto and Olive Oil.
Spaghetti Pomodoro ($24) Tomato Sauce, Basil with Turkey Meatballs. 
Rigatoni Arrabiata ($17.50) Spicy Pomodoro Sauce, Italian Herbs and Pepperoncini. 

All pasta dishes are served with freshly grated parmigiano reggiano and both were super yummy! 

Love this place, it's the best! :)"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick dinner before opera! Good services! Nice and quiet.

Close to the four seasons Performing Art Centre, convenient place to dine. They also have the pre-theatre meal. 

Definitely would come here for the cozy environment."}
{"text":"I was invited to a business dinner here with 5 others, and we were treated to excellent service, beautiful decor and great food. 

We were there for 4 hours and not once did we feel rushed to leave. I didn't pay so I can't say whether it was worth the price... but I enjoyed my meal (pesto pasta with shrimp). I will note that the char on the shrimp tasted bitter/burnt but the bruschetta was really tasty (I usually find this appetizer boring and bland), and to finish, the tiramisu was delicious.

In the heart of Toronto, it's a great spot if you're craving tasty and filling Italian food in a nice ambiance with good service."}
{"text":"We were here for Valentine's Day. Food was delicious, service was alright. Felt a little rushed because they were probably booked back to back. Would go back again when I am feeling like carbs."}
{"text":"The hostess and server were both really accommodating and friendly and the ambiance of the restaurant was very open and classy. The food was good. I liked the fact that portions were pretty big (I came in for Summerlicious and I was pleasantly surprised to find out about the bigger portions). However, I found that the linguine vongole that I had just wasn't as flavourful as it could have been. The chocolate budino that I had right after made up for the slightly bland linguine though. Overall, I would say that I like Little Anthony's and I am looking forward to trying other items from their menu."}
{"text":"The portions here are extremely small. The food is of low quality. Very flavourless. 

the service was bad as well. I came on tuesday at 11:30 and it took 40 minutes for the starter to come. Furthermore the server brought the wrong dessert. Overall the food quality was bad. This is the worst restaurant ive been at this price range in toronto."}
{"text":"Little Anthony's is an upscale looking Italian restaurant in the heart of the Financial District.  I literally work beside it at an office building and when my friend from my old team wanted to meet up for dinner, craving for some Italian food, we decided to come here because it was close and looked beautiful from the outside.

On a Friday night at 630pm, no reservation was required.  We were greeted and seated right away when we walked in.  First impression of the restaurant was, it looked very upscale, very nice decor and would be a perfect place for dates!

I ordered the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese, the safest but yet the hardest Italian pasta to perfect.  My friend ordered the Salmone Al Forno.  My pasta was $20 for the main course size, which when it came, to me wasn't that big, taste wise, it was okay, the meat sauce was normal, nothing too outstanding.  I think Terroni makes the better Bolognese pasta and it is cheaper too! Definitely didn't think it was worth $20.  The salmon presentation was great, but my friend did mention it was a little too oily.  For $20 a pasta, there is a lot of options within the area.

We also ordered the Dark Chocolate Budino to share. The name of the dessert is misleading, it says Dark Chocolate, but they actually use Milk Chocolate, thus I thought it was a little too sweet.  However, the presentation of the dessert was cute.

Overall, a 3 star Italian restaurant.  I would recommend just walking 10 minutes further to Terroni and have their pasta there instead."}
{"text":"Classy upscale Italian. Very well prepared food. Top waiters, very professional. Good wines too. Sit at the bar have some wine and appetizers or at the small tables by the window. I eat out every week because I travel for work and this is a welcome stop for me. My local friends reckon its top also."}
{"text":"Very good food and friendly service. We enjoyed the pasta and pizza. Turkey meatballs and Bruschetta were amazing. We got the free meatballs with the checkin. Would go there again for sure."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Little Anthony's for years. The service, food and location make this my go to place for client and staff meals and meetings.  

The staff (especially Bill) treat us like family, so I bring my family here too. 

I could live on the Shrimp Scampi and always add Turkey Meatballs to my Spaghetti Pomodoro. 

This is a Toronto classic."}
{"text":"You know a restaurant is \"par excellence\" when you keep going back again and again to relive your amazing dining experience!  Little Anthony's is like a fine wine ... keeps getting better and better with age :)

I called 5 restaurants if they can accommodate a party of 14 for lunch and not one of them can help me in the predicament I'm in.  Frustrated and about to throw in the towel, I remembered Little Anthony's. To make the long story short, LA accepted us with open arms. Katy Yu (the Gen. Manager) was gracious enough to accommodate us on short notice. I also learned that she was on leave but still managed to act on my request.  This to me,  shows how an LA employee goes above and beyond their duties.  In addition, Katy is the same manager who personally emailed and thanked me when I posted my first review of LA. I have written reviews but she's the only one who expressed her sincere gratitude for my online feedback.

And as if luck is really on our side, I was so happy to see that our waiter was \"MICHAEL\" ... yes the same MICHAEL who served us before! He remembered me and he was gracious as ever. If there was an award for Best Server, hands down it should go to Michael!  He's a perfect example of how a Hospitality Employee should be - Professional, Calm, People-Oriented and Caring.

Gosh and I haven't even talked about the food! I could go on and on how great Little Anthony's is,  but I'll just leave it up to you to experience it first-hand."}
{"text":"Booked for a group dinner following work event. The service was fantastic and everything was excellent from drinks to desert. The bacon wrapped dates were a wonderful appetizer. The turkey meatballs were really good too and I loved my risotto dinner."}
{"text":"Went with a party of 14 which they gladly accommodated but received horrible service. Waited an hour for two orders of spaghetti(which were comped thankfully). Food was flavorful but small portions."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with some friends one night, it was surprisingly empty when we got there and it was only around 7:30pm, granted it was on a weekday, but I still expected it to be busier. 
To start, the service was great, I have absolutely no complaints about the service at all. The host and the waitress and waiter were fantastic, the bottle of wine we had was great and it wasn't too expensive either. My one complaint really is the food, and that is a problem when you're a restaurant. 
I was so excited to come here since I've heard some good reviews and a few friends have been here before and enjoyed it (though years ago). I got the bruschetta as a starter then the carbonara as the main. The bruschetta was decent, the bread was a little soggy so that's a downside, and the pasta was in general, disappointing. It was bland and surprisingly small in portion considering the price. 
If you're thinking of getting the turkey meatballs as an appetizer, I would suggest adding the turkey meatballs to your pasta instead as it's $9 instead of $16 and they are the same in portion size. 

All in all, the service was great, the wine was great, but the pasta fell short, and that is disappointing considering it's an Italian restaurant"}
{"text":"Little Anthony's is an italian restaurant in the heart of downtown Toronto. The restaurant comes off as fairly upscale, with nice lighting, a fancy atmosphere and people generally dressed accordingly. The service was generally very good, with attentive staff and free coat check ins. Both times, I came here for a friend's birthday as they allow for large group reservations.

However, the food was mediocre at best. They started off serving bread, which tasted stale and was generally unappetizing. For dinner, I shared the \"Tagliatelle alla Bolognese\", turkey meatballs (yelp deal when you check in at the restaurant) and a caesar salad with my girlfriend. None of the dishes were terrible but they were just generally bland. The meatball was a bit dry and lacked flavor, certainly not worth the $16 price tag on the menu. My pasta was again bland and unexciting- reminded me of pasta I could make for myself. The caesar salad didn't have much dressing on it and was just a boring salad. The prices were also generally expensive (~$25 for a pasta dish, $15 for any appetizer).

Overall, I would expect more from a restaurant with this type atmosphere and pricing. The food is forgettable and uninteresting, so I wouldnt come here if you're looking for your next favorite Italian spot. However, it might be worth looking into for a large group or if you're looking for this type of atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped in based on a recommendation - had an excellent meal all around.  Cocktail, wine, appetizer, entrée and desert, each was superb.  My fellow diners also were extremely happy.  I took on the special of tuna carpaccio with New Zealand rack of lamb which was excellent and not over whelming."}
{"text":"I went to Little Anthony's for dinner on a Saturday night because it was across the street from where I was staying. It was early so I was able to find a seat at the bar. The atmosphere was nice and the bar was spacious with large tvs. I had a blast watching hockey during my meal. I tried the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese ($20) and although it looked amazing, it wasn't as good as I had hoped. It was pretty much just meat and pasta. The sauce was super light and did not stick to the pasta at all. I also had a cocktail (Aperol Spritz) ($11) and it was also only ok. Other than that, the service was excellent."}
{"text":"To get in the mood for an Italian opera piece like \"Don Giovanni\" at the Four Seasons (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/four-seasons-centre-for-the-performing-arts-toronto), what food's going to hit the mark?  Give you a hint:  Not Tex-Mex.  Little Anthony's is a medium-sized restaurant but is big on flavours and atmosphere.

I arrived in advance of my dinner reservation to grab a drink at the bar.  A long bar that runs the length of the entire lounge is serviced by a bartender in formal dress and armed with the ability to mix a very nice cocktail.  Admittedly, my scotch and soda was not the most challenging of potable, but others that came in around me were more complex and were dealt with with ease.  So, the staff are well prepared, then.

We were sat to our table in the long artery that runs parallel with the bar that empties into a larger dining area at the rear of the restaurant.  The wait staff are dressed formally and blend well with the décor that puts you in mind of the old-style Italian restaurants with white table cloths, ornate fixtures, and semi-circle booths for privacy for two or more.

After our waiter finished performing an acapella version of \"Some Enchanted Evening\" to the entire dining room (Yeah, I had to read that twice myself...this happens here apparently where singers are hired as wait staff and will burst into song when they have a moment), our order was taken, our appetisers and wine delivered efficiently, our entrees hot and delicious.  The freshness of the ingredients is apparent in every genuine Italian morsel.  Delish.  Also, an eye was kept on the time, as we were asked if we were going to the opera.  Sadly, the staff, like us, thought that the opera started at 8:00pm, not 7:30pm.

Oops.  At least the cappuccino was tasty."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Toronto in a weekly basis, and so far (6 weeks after) I have not had any meal that could give me a WOW feeling. That ended last night when I decided to try this restaurant which was located right next to my hotel. Upon arriving inside of the restaurant, I could smell the fresh pasta in the air, which was a great sign!

Everything is absolutely fantastic not to mention the service and attention by the manager while you dine. I had the \"Bacon Wrapped Dates\" and that is probably one of the most flavorful foods I have ever ate! I am coming back for more and more excellent dinners here! I actually started putting this review together before my first course was even received. If this restaurant is rated 160 on TripAdvisor it is because it is underrated."}
{"text":"Not impressed but it may just be their Summerlicious menu. Bland, boring and expected. The eggplant was overcooked aand the tomato sauce was the same limp sauce served on the entree, store-bought gnocchi. Dull, dull, dull. Pedestrian considering the location and the ratings. The dessert was the saving grace. Fresh sorbet, three delightfully tangy berry and fruit sherberts. 

Thankfully the maitre d was uber pleasant and seated us precisely where we asked. Note, the booths are not conducive to private conversation. Ask for a table. We did. No problem. I'll go back to try the regular menu and the small bar for cocktails. I'll pass on the Summerlicious menu tho."}
{"text":"I met a girlfriend for lunch here this week.
I have to say that they've made great improvements at Little Anthony's.
Inside the decor is much more modern, and airy, and just a much more welcoming space.

The food and the service were really great. I had the Seabass done Mediterranean-style with tomatoes, black olives, and capers. It was wonderful. My girlfriend had chicken done with garlic and rosemary glaze that which looked amazing. 

The server was attentive without have hovering, he came and brought bread with olive oil and balsamic. We also enjoyed our meal with a wonderful white wine from Lillypilly. 

To finish it off we had their ricotta fritters with orange sauce. Mouthwatering!!!

The music in the background was nice but not overpowering which was fantastic since we had a good catch-up and we didn't feel like we had to fight over loud music to talk to each other. Would definitely recommend this place to anybody that wants a nice Italian meal in the downtown core."}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the plush velour and overly decadent interiors, Little Anthony's is really quite charming. I went with a large group. Originally skeptical of its authenticity and rather bland menu, I was soon convinced otherwise.

We were seated at the very back of the restaurant as we were a large group. In the future, I would suggest reserving one of the round half-open booths that seat 2-4 as it is both intimate and comfortable. 

Our starter salad was a heap of arugula, smaller than usual (I take it because it is wild), lightly dressed and a generous portion of pecorino cheese. It was delicious and definitely appetizing. For our pasta dish, I had the butternut squash ravioli with brown butter, rosemary, hazelnuts and pecorino. The taste was very subtle and not as anticipated, since butternut squash and rosemary were such strong flavours. The portion was just right and the sauce was a delight. I actually stole some extra bread to mop it up. My fellow eaters who had the spaghetti alla bolognese said it was also quite hearty and delicious. I had my eyes set on their ossobuco, and was glad I chose it. The saffron risotto was exactly al dente, with a little bite with each mouthful; it almost stole the thunder from the veal shank. The ossobuco was a bit overcooked and oversalted for my liking, but that could have been because of the cut, which was not as thick as usual. My favourite part of the meal though - the marrow. It was generous, rich and really really fresh. Growing up I was basically raised on marrow, and taught to get everything out of the bone. Suffice to say, that was the most satisfying part. Also because in discovering my love, my tablemates gladly gave up their marrows. At this point I may have been delirious and drunk from marrow, because the desserts offered escape me. There was a choice between chocolate truffle cake (cheese cake?) and tiramisu, both average.

I would highly recommend visiting Little Anthony's for their pasta, as the mains were somewhat average. Bring a healthy appetite and an open mind for the waitstaff - who appear to be slightly disorganized and distracted."}
{"text":"We decided to try LA's for something new and were very impressed. For starters we ordered off the small appetizers section: salty cod on crostini,marinated eggplant and caponata. All very tasty and good presentation. For my main I had the seared scallops which were excellent with a side order of tossed rapini (past time fav). My companion ordered a 16oz. Veal chop and it came with a fresh side of tomatoes tossed in pesto. Nice combo and once again, great presentation. The service was perfect. I would def go back again."}
{"text":"Great place to check out.

Staff: They offered to take my jacket, and since it was a rainy day, I took them up on the offer. Staff checked in on us multiple times, water was filled, overall great service!

Ambience: It was comfortable and everything felt sleek and clean. Don't know how I feel about orange chairs though...

Food: The portions are smaller, but I was filled nonetheless. The food was really good. I had the Turkey Meatballs and Tagliatelle Carbonara. The pasta had great texture and taste. The meatballs was yummy but I found the sauce to be over seasoned. 

I had a very pleasant experience and would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Came on a weekday for lunch with a party of 5. Jacket was offered to be taken at the entrance. We had the sparkling water. Had 3 appetizers to share and I got a carbonara pasta with the dark chocolate budino

For appetitizers I got the turkey meatballs as Yelp had a free coupon. We also ordered a large antipasto board and bacon wrapped dates. The board was okay nothing special. The bacon wrapped date was actually very tasty and special since it was sweet with he crunchiness of the bacon.

Antipasto board:$25, 3 stars
Bacon wrapped dates $9, 4 stars
Turkey meatballs free with Yelp check in, 3 stars

Tagliatelle alla carbonara: $19, 3.5 star
A bit garlicy for my taste. However I can tell the pasta was hand made but too soft for my liking. The favour was good though for the sauce.

Dark chocolate budino,$9, 4 stars
Tasty, not too sweet. But nothing special.

All in all, it was a good meal. A lot of the reviews said the portions are small. I think they are alright, maybe 20% less then normal pasta place.  However with an appetizer main and dessert it's more than enough. If you're ordering just the entree you wouldn't be full."}
{"text":"We watched the latest Hawks vs Pacers game with my friend. They were kind enough to turn on the TV for us. Food was excellent, nothing to say. My friend always recommended this place but I didn't expect the food to be this good. A bit pricey, but not totally worth it."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch during work once.  Had one of the lunch specials which was a funghi pasta.. was quite mediocre for Italian food.  It's a nice resto to go for work occasions I suppose, I wouldn't come here with friends after the medicore food though.  Also did not have a relaxing feel, even though decor was quite nice.  Service was great though, and I enjoyed our vanilla panna cotta dessert with caramelized apple compote and toasted oat + nut crumble.  Not a memorable resto on my Italian faves but not bad, either."}
{"text":"I came here once before when it was a old style, classic Italian restaurant with solid food. I was attracted by the renovation and open, contemporary design to try it again. This time, the food seemed much more pricey and smaller portions than what I remembered. While i liked the open design with floor to window glass windows that let in more light, I couldn't help but think the large screen TVs over the bar marred the new design. The food was OK - I can't say there was anything that stood out. The prices were also quite high for the quality of pasta. If you're looking for Italian food in the area, I would suggest places such as Terroni or even Mercatto on the east side of the financial district. Much better food and value!"}
{"text":"Mediocre. Pasta not al dente. Waiter couldn't get the orders right. Brought an extra side not ordered, and then charged for it, rather than comping the $8. Over priced for the quality."}
{"text":"We were staying in downtown Toronto for one night and this restaurant caught our eye as it was right next to our hotel.  It looked like an upscale restaurant and we decided to walk in.  The dining hall was full, but we were seated in the bar area.  The bar area was really comfortable with large tables.

I told the waiter that I am a vegetarian and if he could substitute the meat in some of the pasta dishes for some vegetables (mushrooms, peppers etc).  He waiter informed me that the chef cannot substitute anything in the recipe.  This turned me off a bit as most restaurants are very accommodating with vegetarian preferences.  Anyways, I asked him to just remove the meat without any substitutions.

Now to the food:
- They served bread as we were seated, and the bread was just amazing.  I ended up asking for another serving.  The bread was warm, perfectly flavored, and served with olive oil.
- Coastal Russet Fries:  Fries with flavor...we finished these within minutes.  So good!!
- Rigatoni Arrabiata (without guanciale): one of the best pastas I have eaten in a long time.  It was perfect portion (not large plates like cheesecake factor).  The spicy sauce added to the deliciousness of the pasta.  I am craving it as I write this review.  AMAZING!!!
- Roasted Ontario Pork: My husband ordered this and made sure I mentioned this in my review.  He said this was the best pork he has ever eaten.  Apparently, this is one of their signature dishes.

We had a chat with the owner as well.  He was a very friendly guy from New York. He was telling us about the chef and other restaurants he owns.

I would have given this restaurant 5 stars had it not been for the limited vegetarian options available at this place and unwillingness of substituting some veggies for the meat.

Other than that, the food is just amazing.  Its definitely on the pricey side, but the food and ambiance are so worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Portions were small, long wait for food, messed up my drink order and food order, only reason for two stars is they brought the correct fixed order out fast. 17% gratitude to parties should not be added if bad service was received."}
{"text":"Good Italian place. More fine dining than other places. A bit pricy for me. It still very good."}
{"text":"I met friends for supper tonight at Little Anthony's.  I'd never been there before.

We got there when it opened.

We were given some bread and oil to start ... it was good.

I ordered Rigatoni Arrabiata (spicy tomato sauce, smoked bacon, garlic, basil).  It was okay.  It wasn't spicy at all and I didn't notice the bacon.  Some of the noodles weren't quite cooked.  I thought $17.50 was a lot to pay for what I got.

Deb and Liz ordered Strozzapreti (duck confit, mushrooms, parmigiano).

Franca ordered Linguine al Olio (shrimp, garlic, chili, fresh arugula) and substituted the linguine for rigatoni.

Hugo, our server, took good care of us."}
{"text":"Friday 7pm getting a table for 3 right away. Interior a nice upscaled Italian restaurant. Service is very friendly and fast. We start with the Bruschetta an the beet carpaccio - we share it with 3 plates. I like the olive oil with bread in the Italian restaurants - also here is a bottle of olive oil on the table. My sea bass is very well prepared and presented also the risotto my wife had tasted great. As usual in the Italian kitchen they use olive oil for cooking -  a little too much for my taste. My wife and my daughter like the half size  dishes. The wine list is ok but the choice of wines per glass could be better. For closing the diner we share a panna cotta with 3 spoons. It's probably tending to be more of a $$$ place than a $$ but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"ENVIRONMENT - When I think classy Italian dining, I'd probably think of Little Anthony's since it's complete with the whole ensemble of white tablecloths, mirrored walls,  dim lights, cushiony seats etc. It's a great place to take a date imo. 

SERVICE - Bill was our server, and he was fantastic and super friendly and attentive..even exchanging a couple of dirty innuendos with my table.

FOOD - They have a regular sized and a smaller sized for a slightly cheaper price. The smaller portion size is great if you're ordering an appetizer as well. But since we didn't,  I got the Risotto funghi (regular portion for $19), which comes with mascarpone, truffle, thyme. It was just the right amount of creamy and mushroomy, and smelt and tasted soo good. And it's a personal preference, but I liked how they didn't cut up the mushrooms into tiny pieces, and kept the mushrooms into bite-sized chunks.

My party also shared the ricotta fritter dessert with chopped hazelnuts and few pieces of candied orange. It comes with this really nice custard-like cream you can dip your fritters in. To be honest, I couldn't really taste the ricotta cheese as it was more like a doughnut/fritter-like pastry to me. It was $9 for 5 pieces, which I think is a little bit pricey for what it's worth, but nonetheless it was still tasty. I'd recommend sharing this since I don't think I could have finished all 5 fritters by myself.. a bit too much dough. 

Overall, great quality pastas in a classy dining environment. I'd come back to try out the other pastas!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this review. I went here for the first time with a number of colleagues while we were attending a conference nearby. We made a reservation here for 6:30 PM based partly on the restaurant's reputation for great food and partly on location  convenient to Church Wellesley. 

The entire party was seated and served with drinks by about 6:45 PM, and that's when the problem began. Some 45 minutes later, those of us who had ordered cold appetizers or salads received them, while those who had ordered hot appetizers, including minestrone, did not get their first course until nearly half an hour later. 

We were informed that the kitchen was backed up and our server was appropriately apologetic. However, all we got for the next hour was continued occasional apologies. We did not receive our main courses until two hours after we were seated. The restaurant was not even full at this time, as there were at least two empty tables, and several tables were only partially occupied.

That said, the food was good, and beautifully prepared.  the restaurant itself is lovely, and the staff were very polite. The bresaola & pear salad was good, though not stunning, and my garganelli pasta was delicious,  albeit rather pricey for the half portion that I ordered. The restaurant offered us a free dessert, but at that point we had been there for two and half hours and were running very late for an event."}

{"text":"We went there for dinner on a Friday night. I can say, this place is pricey with respect to its food quality. We didn't expect such a low quality food at this Italian restaurant.

We ordered Tomato Caprese, Spaghetti Pomodoro, and Chicken Parmigiana. The Tomato Caprese was horrible. The Spaghetti POMODORO came with almost no tomato sauce.

There are much better place in the area where you can have good qualify and delicious Italian food. I don't recommend you to dine in at Little Anthony's."}
{"text":"I don't think the portions in this place could be any smaller without calling it tapas. Seriously, the food here is so expensive and servings are so small you can't help but leave feeling a little ripped off. I could understand if this were some premium italian place (which it obviously tries to dress as) but it's clear from the food and menu that there's nothing special about it.

They were out of the meatballs when we got here (seriously?) but were nice enough to honor the yelp check in offer with a Cesar salad instead. The food had so little flavor and was so skimp that this place definitely does not leave much to be desired."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good: nice lighting, fancy-feeling atmosphere, table settings are fancy. Polite staff. 

They legit gave us what appeared to be cut up Wonderbread, meanwhile everyone else around us had sourdough. The bread was laughable, I had to ask the waiter what this was. For a place that serves $15 glasses of wine and $30 pastas, I would expect more. He said it was fresh. \"Fresh out of the Dempsters bag, you mean?\" He responded that it was from the lobster place next door at the Assembly Hall. Oh ok, so they thought it was appropriate to cut up sandwich bread and serve that. Pretty sure if they had given us no bread at all we would have been happier. It was borderline insulting.

The crowd is very homogeneous, and of the older white male in suits variety. One patron even bowled into my friend on his way out the door, knocking her aside. No apologies or anything, we were both in shock that happened. 

My main wasn't bad. It wasn't anything special flavour-wise but the pasta at least looked fresh. I got the tagliatelle with Bolognese. The noodles were asymmetrical at times which made it look fresh and authentic. That was probably the highlight. 

Wine was mediocre. They definitely don't specialize in wine, and for an Italian restaurant, didn't appear to have any of the more interesting-sounding Italian wines by the glass. The Australian Shiraz was disappointing; not sure if it'd been open for a while but it didn't taste great. 

Service was friendly and polite but condescending and even gaslighting at one point. For dessert they brought us donuts that were raw on the inside and burnt on the outside. The server insisted it was because of the ricotta, but it was obvious where the separation lied between the ricotta and raw dough. He tried to convince us it wasn't raw and that it looked that way because of the ricotta. I asked to speak to the manager because there's no way that was cooked. The manager said he will ask the chef. As a manager you should know. Our theory was that because it was late they rushed to get it done so they could go home, cranking up the heat of the deep fryer and cooking it for less time, resulting in a raw centre and burnt exterior. They had candied orange and some spices on it, so on paper it sounded amazing, and it smelled good, but it was poorly executed. I think if the real chef had made these as intended it would've had the potential to be really good because I have a hard time believing this was true to the design or that their head dessert chef was on-site.

The manager was kind enough to comp our wine for the bad experiences of running out of proper bread and giving us raw donuts, otherwise this would've been a solid 1-star. 

I can't say I would ever go back, but I am still willing to try the Assembly Hall next door even though Little Anthony's owns it. It's a completely different setup and atmosphere, but the people and vibe are different."}
{"text":"Really delicious Italian food in downtown Toronto.    I got the bacon wrapped dates as my appetizer, and they have become one of the best things I've ever eaten in a restaurant.  They were so good!!  Part of me wants to try to make some on my own, but realizes that there is a chance I will never meet my own expectations.   For my main meal I got the Ricotta Agnolotti, which is the first time I've ever had this dish and it was delicious.  I'm so happy that I got a chance to eat here while in Toronto."}
{"text":"This italian restaurant is recommended by the hotel concierge. Actual the recommended two places, one Italian and one French. I asked which one  is his favorite, and he couln't say. I went out searching, and found that the French place was a bit dim. So I went to this Italian restaurant, and I am happy for my choice. I ordered shrimp, salmon, lobster with pasta. I was served some bread before the lunch. The bread was good, and the lunch was delicious. I am a bit afraid that I ate a bit too much. I love the place."}
{"text":"Little Anthony's is an upscale and fancy looking restaurant that comes with a moderate price tag and unpretentious service. The restaurant setting is lovely, with lots of mirrors, wine glasses, ambient lighting (but not super dim), and would be a good choice for a date or office dinner. 

In terms of the actual food, I thought it was good, but wasn't the best Italian I've had, hence the 3-star review. I debated between the risotto funghi and spaghetti pomodoro (spaghetti with turkey meatballs) and ended up getting the spaghetti on the recommendation of our server. I will say that the turkey meatballs were quite good - very moist and juicy and flavourful and were really supposed to be the highlight to this dish, which they were. Other than that though, it was just spaghetti, and I think other menu items would have been more interesting. You can order the turkey meatballs separately as an appetizer, so I would recommend doing that and splitting them with your group so you can try them. I like that they offer the option to get a small size or full size for all their pasta dishes. 

My group split the ricotta fritters for dessert which came with candied orange, hazelnuts and spiced crema. It was quite a tasty dessert, but honestly again it wasn't amazing, they just tasted like regular donuts that you could get from like Tiny Tom's or whatever - no hint of ricotta whatsoever. Probably wouldn't get this again, although it was enjoyable.

We also shared a bottle of white wine and after splitting it four ways ended up being about $10/person - pretty reasonably priced, especially considering the nice ambiance of this restaurant!

Although this wouldn't be my number one choice for Italian food, I wouldn't mind coming here again to try other things, and our server on my last visit was very engaging and funny and made our dining experience fun!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Linguine  vongolle  is great. Service is fast. They once took the linguine off the menu and I didn't go.  Thanks for putting it back on."}
{"text":"excellent food. Expensive but worth ir. Service good. Staff attentive. Being vegan, I asked for some modifications to my pasta and I was accommodated. And enjoyable meal!"}
{"text":"Little Anthony's was quite a find. It is located squarely in the business/hotel/theater area of Toronto. (We drove, thinking they had parking, but if they did, it was not obvious to us). 

Yelp had a check in special for turkey meatballs, so we got to try them. Everyone enjoyed them. For other appetizers, we had the bacon wrapped dates (I had these other places and I always enjoy), as well as the Caesar salad. Excellent.

Pasta dishes come in tasting sizes and larger sizes, which is perfect if you want to eat lighter. We had the  bolognese, the penne arrabbiata, the chicken parm, and buttered pasta for the younger child. Service was excellent and friendly. I would return. Enjoyed it a lot."}
{"text":"Surprenant, je m'attendais à pas grand chose mais le risotto aux champignons a passé le test avec brio et tout le reste était très bien. Rien à redire, dans le genre italien ultraclassique, c'est parfait surtout si on est dans un des hôtels tout près et qu'on a pas envie de se casser la tête. La carte de vin est \"acceptable\". La sélection au verre pourrait être plus intéressante."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. the food wasn't too memorable but good enough for me to go again if someone wants to go. service was pretty good and good atmosphere inside."}
{"text":"Great ambience to this restaurant. The servers were very lovely as well. Keep in mind this could be pricy if you are a three course meal type of person. We ordered the antipasto plate which was good but meat heavy. My main dish was the linguini with clams, cherry tomatoes and chilli flakes. This was a fantastic pasta dish that actually had spice to it and had a delicious broth. Again in my opinion ,it was a little pricey for pasta all around. As for dessert I had the chocolate mousse. Super yummy. A must have if you love chocolate mouse like me!"}
{"text":"Little Anthony's has a nice, small menu with some good Italian staples. I throughly enjoyed the meatballs and the sauce was a nice homemade surprise. I wasn't as excited about my martini, probably a poor choice for an Italian restaurant, so I would definitely stick with wine... or water. But, the food and the service were quite good."}
{"text":"Food was good, decent Italian, we thought that portions are on the lighter side. Service was good and bathroom is clean. Good for dinner pre-theatre or ballet at Four Seasons Performing Arts since it's just down the street. Good after work dinner location"}
{"text":"Was looking around for new restaurants in the Financial District and wondering why Little Anthony's didn't come across any searches. Came here once for lunch with coworkers and it was a perfect spot for lunch within the area.

The place seemed to be recently renovated when we got there and is spacious and bright with huge windows that seem to make the place bigger. Food was good as well, can't exactly recall what I had but it was good. Portion sizes were planned out well especially for the lunch crowd. I would definitely recommend this place for those looking for a new place within the Financial District who don't mind spending more for a good lunch."}
